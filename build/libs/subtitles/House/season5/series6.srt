00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,055
What time?

00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:28,390
4:30.

5
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:29,724
Why so late?

00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,493
Make-up test
in social studies.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,829
Did you invite Shelby for Saturday?
- No.

8
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:36,097
Do you want me to call her?

9
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:37,799
Yeah, that'd be great,

10
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:39,601
you calling a 12-year-old girl
for a sleepover.

11
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:42,037
It'll be fine.
- Make you a deal.

12
00:00:42,103 --> 00:00:43,505
I'll call a friend
when you call a friend.

[Exhales]

00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:48,376
It's your birthday,

15
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:49,311
Thank you.
Bye.

Heh.

[Door closes]

20
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:45,000
What did you forget?

21
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:46,668
Nothing.
Then why'd you come back?

22
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:47,936
'Cause I live here.

23
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:49,170
Come on, Samantha,

24
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:50,138
you're gonna be late
for school.

25
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:51,306
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:52,574
It's 4:30.

27
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:04,552
Are you okay?

28
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,823
I, uh...

[sets down coffee can]

30
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,726
Tired, I guess.

31
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:25,974
(Samantha)
What's wrong?

32
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:31,012
I don't know.

33
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:08,983
Great.
That's all I need to know.

34
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,552
You're late!

35
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:13,788
Okay, bye.

36
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:16,858
37-year-old male
with recurring blackouts.

37
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:18,326
Tell him to switch
from tequila to bourbon.

38
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:19,561
Worked for me.

39
00:03:19,627 --> 00:03:21,296
The three doctors
he's already seen

40
00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:22,464
already ruled out
drugs and alcohol.

41
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,698
Well, then it's epilepsy.

42
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:24,999
Tell him to buy
a hockey helmet--

43
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:28,036
EEG's clean.
So is the CT.

44
00:03:28,103 --> 00:03:29,938
Relax.

45
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:31,806
Just because you got approved
by an adoption agency

46
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:33,775
doesn't mean you'll get approved
by the birth mother.

47
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:35,143
You're a single mom.

48
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,745
That puts you somewhere
below couples acquitted

49
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:38,113
in daycare scandals.

50
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:40,181
You're welcome, Dr. House.

51
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:43,318
It is an interesting case.

52
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:46,454
What time are you
seeing the mom?

53
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:48,423
Are you having
your guy follow me?

54
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,259
I just trashed
your social value as a mother,

55
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:52,694
and all I got was
a little sarcasm.

56
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:55,330
It means you don't feel
the need to defend yourself,

57
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:57,866
which means you're not worried
about getting a kid,

58
00:03:57,932 --> 00:03:59,401
which means you've
already got one.

59
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:02,704
We're meeting at 11:00.

60
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:05,106
She's due to deliver
a baby girl in two weeks.

61
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:06,841
I'm sure
the mom'll be thrilled

62
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:08,376
to hand her crack baby
off to a doctor.

63
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:09,644
She's not a crack baby.

64
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:11,446
No, mother's
perfectly healthy.

65
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:12,514
She just had
to give up the baby

66
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,448
in order
to continue her work

67
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:16,050
on the human genome.

68
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:18,253
She confessed
to some past meth use.

69
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,356
What they don't confess to

70
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:22,624
is almost always
more interesting.

71
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,858
This is a mistake.

72
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:25,627
Because a kid you don't know

73
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,328
may have some problems
you don't know about

74
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:28,797
that she may have
passed on to a kid?

75
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:30,698
Because you're
a control seeking narcissist.

76
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:33,468
Which is fine,
good even, in some jobs.

77
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:34,602
But you're not equipped
to handle a real kid,

78
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:37,338
never mind
a factory second.

79
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:39,507
Where are you meeting her?

80
00:04:39,574 --> 00:04:40,975
In a little place called

81
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,410
"follow me
and your urologist

82
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:44,879
will be buying himself
a new yacht."

83
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:46,748
They explained
the returns policy, right?

84
00:04:46,815 --> 00:04:48,583
It's worse than video games.
I'm not changing my mind.

85
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:54,022
(Thirteen)
Could be post concussion syndrome.

86
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:56,224
Not without
a pre-concussion.

87
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,393
Pick a number.
For what?

88
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,395
Cuddy pool.
She got the nod.

89
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:01,796
Little tweaker's
due in 14 days.

90
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:04,599
That's great news...
I think.

91
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,667
It's good news.

92
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:07,101
The great news is

93
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:08,570
she insisted that she's
not gonna change her mind,

94
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:09,838
which means she's

95
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:11,406
actually thought
about changing her mind,

96
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,241
which means she's not sure
she's ready to be a mom,

97
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:14,442
which means she's
not ready to be a mom,

98
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:15,944
which means she's gonna
change her mind.

99
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,212
The only question is when.

100
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:19,147
$100 buy in.

101
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:21,149
Less than seven means
the next seven days.

102
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:23,218
But she's been dying
for a kid for three years.

103
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:24,219
No way she's gonna
back out now.

104
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:25,954
Not one of the options.

105
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,960
Mini strokes can cause
blackouts and memory loss.

106
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:34,062
Nine hours is a lot of time
to be out for a mini stroke.

107
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:36,264
And there'd be
residual damage on the ct.

108
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:38,299
(Thirteen) Guy works at home
as a consumer product tester.

109
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:40,001
He could've been exposed
to a toxin

110
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:41,336
that caused short term
memory loss.

111
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:43,004
Wouldn't show up
on imaging.

112
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:44,172

113

and memory loss.

114
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:47,675
I'll take 7 to 14.

115
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:49,077
We have a player.

116
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:50,512
You just said it was
great news.

117
00:05:50,578 --> 00:05:51,579
Now you want to bet
against her?

118
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:52,714
It's only great news

119
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,349
if she wants it
to be great news.

120
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:55,617
House knows her better
than any of us.

121
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:57,585
I'd rather use
pseudonym.

122
00:05:57,652 --> 00:06:00,355
Good thinking.

123
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:03,324
I say she's gonna meet
the mom and bolt.

124
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:04,526
I'm going
for the early fold.

125
00:06:04,592 --> 00:06:07,662
Check his home
for toxins

126
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:12,267
and his sinuses
for thrombosises.

127
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,702
Maybe he ODed on caffeine.

128
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:16,404
Apparently he didn't drink
the coffee.

129
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:18,373
He just smelled it.

130
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:21,910
Wow.

131
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:26,381
Did they just move here?

132
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:28,149
(Thirteen)
Six years ago.

133
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:29,284
This is no way
to raise a kid.

134
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,351
He's a single dad.

135
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:32,754
I'm sure
he's doing his best.

136
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,621
Which is why single people
shouldn't have kids.

137
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:36,724
You got a problem
with what Cuddy's doing?

138
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,993
You think
single mothers can't--

139
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,195
I think the traditional
family is a fraud.

140
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:43,798
Even married moms
are single moms.

141
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:44,966
Daddy just pays
some bills

142
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:46,768
and reads just enough
bedtime stories

143
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:47,869
to not kill himself
t of guilt.

144
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:49,871
My dad was great.
After my mom died--

145
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:51,306
he might be the exception.

146
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:52,574
On the other hand,

147
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,076
you are fairly screwed up.

148
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:04,519
No booze, no meds,
no drugs.

149
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:06,054
And no view.

150
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,622
Building's half-empty.

151
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:09,190
He'd rather have a view
of the turnpike than the park.

152
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:10,792
Park views are probably
50% more.

153
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:12,160
You're the surprised
the guy's a pragmatist

154
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:13,494
after looking
this place?

155
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:15,463
Guy's not a pragmatist.
He's a flagellant.

156
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,533
Oh. Looks like mold.

157

158

[Baseboard peels off]

159
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:31,879
Mom would've cleaned better.

160
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:36,684
(Thirteen)
Exposure to certain types of mold

161
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:37,885
can cause short term
memory loss.

162
00:07:37,952 --> 00:07:39,387
We're testing both of you.

163
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:40,888
I feel fine.

164
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:42,223
I'm sure you are.

165
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,859
We're just
being cautious.

166
00:07:44,926 --> 00:07:47,395
So where do you guys go
other than home and school?

167
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:48,696
Nowhere.

168
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:50,565
Dad works at home,
and I go to school.

169
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:53,334
What about sports,
friends, travel?

170
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:55,536
Like I said, dad works at home,
and I go to school.

171
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:01,075
Must be hard not having
your mom around, huh?

172
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,878
I was only four
when the accident happened.

173
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:07,615
Still, I'm sure you both
miss her sometimes.

174
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:12,286
Not really.

175
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:14,255
You're strong.

176
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:15,390
No, I just don't get
what the big deal

Physically, she's fine.

181
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:29,237
Mentally, she's weird.

182
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:32,206
I'm sure she's just
freaked out about her dad.

183
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:33,508
Mr. Harmon?

184
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:36,310
Mr. Harmon.

185
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:38,646
Where are you going?

186
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:41,749
[Elevator pings]

187
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:43,751
I have an appointment.
I have to go.

188
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:45,420
We haven't finished
with your treatment.

189
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:46,421
We're still waiting
on some test results.

190
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:48,222
I have an appointment.

191
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:49,123
Sorry, you're gonna have
to reschedule.

192
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,060
I really have to go.

193
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:53,761
Mr. Harmon, do you know
where you are?

194
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:55,830
Why are you
trying to stop me?

195
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,135
His eyes.

196
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:02,470
(Thirteen)
Is he having a seizure?

197
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:05,206
His pupils are responsive.

198
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:07,008
I think he's...asleep.

199
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:14,696
(Taub) He was just asleep.
Means no memory loss.

200
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,035
And sleepwalking
doesn't kill.

201
00:09:16,102 --> 00:09:17,643
Unless he walks out
a window.

202
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,815
Sleepwalking's
not a diagnosis.

203
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:20,020
It's a symptom.

204
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:21,393
As long as we
can't figure out why--

205
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,570
stress-induced insomnia.
Lots of people sleepwalk.

206
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:25,111
Not in the middle
of the day

207
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:26,115
before they've even put
their head on a pillow.

208
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:26,885
Could be some sort
of narcolepsy.

209
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:28,493
Which is caused by--

210
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,004
there's usually
genetic history.

211
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,477
Or?

212
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:35,223
If you know the answer,
can you tell us the answer?

213
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,395
I don't know the answer.

214
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:39,108
Which brings us back to--or?

215
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:40,481
Some sort
of environmental trigger.

216
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:41,619
Which means?

217
00:09:41,686 --> 00:09:42,891
It's a toxin.

218
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,366
So we are?

219
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:45,303
Being lead down
an annoying path.

220
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,609
I honestly don't know

221
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:47,646
where this is going.

222
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:49,254
Just following the clues.

223
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:51,063
We're right back
where we started.

224
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,268
The mold we found
doesn't cause these symptoms.

225
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:53,608
And there's nothing else
at his home.

226
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:55,282
And?

227
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:56,722
And you're obnoxious.

228
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:57,960
He never goes
anywhere else.

229
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:00,372
Which we know because?

230
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,481
Because he says so.
Because his daughter says so.

231
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:04,256
Cause they have
no reason to lie.

232
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:08,107
Which proves he never
goes anywhere else...

233
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,183
when...

234
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,096
he's...

235
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:17,249
conscious.

236
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,688
Oh, my god,
you're right.

237
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:20,933
He said he had
an appointment.

238
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,904
Next time,
let him keep it.

239
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,377
Send him home.

240
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:26,089
See where his dreams
take him.

241
00:10:26,156 --> 00:10:29,170
[Soft music
plays over P.A.]

242
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:46,248
Becca?

243
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:48,425
Dr. Cuddy?

244
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:51,104
Lisa.
Nice to meet you.

245
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:52,711
Oh, you want one?

246
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,285
(Cuddy)
No thanks.

247
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,562
I can't stop eating them.
I guess it's, like, a craving.

248
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:58,872
I must have, like,
a dozen a day.

249
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,021
Oh, and this is decaf.

250
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:03,729
How have you
been feeling?

251
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:07,847
Oh, you know, tired,
fat, nervous.

252
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:11,396
Is there, um, anything
you want to ask me?

253
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,946
Uh, yeah, actually,
I just have one question.

254
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:16,922
Um, what are you
gonna call her?

255
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:19,903
Ah, I'm not sure.

256
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:21,912
It's all been
rather sudden, you know?

257
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:24,490
I like joy.

258
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:27,504
But as I said,
I haven't really decided yet.

259
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:31,254
Well, is there anything
you want to ask me?

260
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:33,832
It's okay.

261
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,420
The agency web site is filled
with prospective parents.

262
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:40,195
Their photos,
their biographies.

263
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:42,573
There's so many wonderful people
out there.

264
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,778
Wonderful couples.

265
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:48,232
Why did I choose
a single mom?

266
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:49,806
My grandmother was married
for 37 years

267
00:11:49,873 --> 00:11:51,647
to a man that treated her
like garbage.

268
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:53,489
And my mom
would've stayed married

269
00:11:53,556 --> 00:11:55,800
to my dad that long,
but he dumped her.

270
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,910
You know, I never understood
how you could fall

271
00:11:57,977 --> 00:11:59,919
for the same crap
as your mother.

272
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,899
Then I met Tony.

273
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:05,478
When I read your bio,

274
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:07,387
a doctor,
a head of a hospital,

275
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:11,840
I saw your picture...

276
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,686
I don't want her
raised by a loser.

277
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:23,726
How long have you had
that rash?

278
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:26,741
I don't know.
A few days?

279
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:27,913
Have you had
any joint pain?

280
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,157
Yeah, I'm pregnant.
All my joints hurt.

281
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:33,839
They shouldn't all hurt.
Have you been using?

282
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:35,314
Not in seven months.

283
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:39,097
Not since I found out
I was pregnant.

284
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:41,576
That needs
to be checked out.

285
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,856
You sure
you don't want children?

286
00:12:51,923 --> 00:12:54,267
You know, just because
we're stuck here

287
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:55,573
and I'm lying down

288
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,846
doesn't mean
we need to get deep.

289
00:12:56,913 --> 00:12:58,118
You're afraid you'll make

290
00:12:58,185 --> 00:12:59,792
the same mistake
you made with your wife.

291
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:02,337
Get caught taking some
other kid to a ball game.

292
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,381
I like my life as it is.

293
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:07,160
Alpha waves increasing.

294
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:08,968
(Taub)
Any change in demeanor?

295
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,241
No, nothing.
He just got up.

296
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:13,220
Maybe it's a result
of the blood pressure change.

297
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:17,440
Delta waves out of nowhere.

298
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:19,751
He's now asleep.

299
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:21,860
Brain's supposed
to turn off motor function.

300
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,736
If the brain was doing what
it was supposed to be doing,

301
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,209
we wouldn't be here.

302
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:28,792
He's leaving.
Come on.

303
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:30,868
(Cameron) She's 38 weeks.
You think it's fifth disease?

304
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,475
What's that?

305
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:34,384
It's a viral infection.
It can infect the fetus.

306
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:36,360
Usually in the first
20 weeks of pregnancy,

307
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:38,905
and in women who have trouble
with their immune system.

308
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:40,579
History of drug abuse could've
compromised her immune system.

309
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:43,292
I told you I haven't used
anything in seven months.

310
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:45,703
It does look more
like a heat rash to me.

311
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,611
Yes, well,
maybe we want to look

312
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,320
at the actual blood tests.

313
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:52,467
Of course.

314
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:54,610
She work for you?
Yeah.

315
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:56,820
Everybody here
works for you.

316
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:00,336
When this happens for real,

317
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:01,911
are you okay
to deliver here?

318
00:14:01,977 --> 00:14:04,288
Yeah, sure.
Good.

319
00:14:04,354 --> 00:14:06,531
Blood work's normal.

320
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:08,340
Test it again.

321
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:10,449
Tested it twice.

322
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,291
I'll get you some topical cream
for that rash.

323
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:14,668
I'm admitting her.

324
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:16,812
There's nothing
wrong with her.

325
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:17,950
There are dozens
of other things

326
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,491
this rash could indicate.

327
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,863
I want
a full fetal work up.

328
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:23,409
(House)
You're losing it.

329
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,786
That's what happens
when you have kids.

330
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:27,460
Ceaseless crying and nagging

331
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:29,838
leads to irrational fears.

332
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:31,044
It's impressive
that you didn't wait

333
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,751
for the actual crying
and nagging.

334
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:34,459
She had a lace pattern rash,
joint pain,

335
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:35,699
and a history
of drug abuse.

336
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:37,373
You would've done
exactly the same thing.

337
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,620
Uh-huh, and I'd be an excellent father.
- Oh!

338
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:42,228
Hey! What are you doing?!

339
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,706
Baby barf.

340
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:47,016
Maternity ward was handing out
free samples.

341
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,059
Well played, sir.

342
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:51,705
You leave me no choice
but to change.

343
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:53,412
My clothes,
not my mind.

344
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,551
That's exactly my point.

345
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:55,556
It's not gonna be me
and a cup.

346
00:14:55,623 --> 00:14:56,795
It's gonna be
eight times a day.

347
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:57,900
If you can't handle wearing
that stain,

348
00:14:57,966 --> 00:14:58,971
you can't handle a baby.

349
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:00,646
Why do you even care?

350
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:02,320
It's not like I'm ever gonna ask
you to babysit.

351
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:04,128
I'm a humanitarian.

352
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,366
We should stop him.

353
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,706
(Thirteen)
The whole point was to--

354
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:15,011
let him plow
into some innocent bystander?

355
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,149
His legs are working.

356
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:17,925
Obviously, his eyes
are working too.

357
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:20,370
His reaction time
could be slower.

358
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,345
He stopping.
Yeah, I see.

359
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:24,857
He's having sleep sex.

360
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,066
Maybe.
Pull up to her.

361
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,477
I know.

362
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:38,418
What'd that guy want?

363
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:40,963
Piss off.

364
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,637
Go after him. She's not a hooker.
- How do you know?

365
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:44,513
(Thirteen) Do you want me
to describe the clues,

366
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,685
or do you want to stop him
before he finishes off

367
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:47,828
the drugs he just bought?

368
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,165
Apparently,
Rip's a coke fiend.

369
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:14,389
Snow white.

370
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:15,624
(Taub)
Coke explains the narcolepsy.

371
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:17,693
Narcolepsy explains
the sleepwalking.

372
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,562
But it doesn't explain the rip
in the space time continuum.

373
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:23,899
Coke leads to sleepwalking,
which leads to coke,

374
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:24,967
which leads
to sleepwalking.

375
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:26,301
What caused
the first sleepwalking?

376
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:27,636
The coke he took
while he was wide awake.

377
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,271
Says he didn't.

378
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:30,572
Wouldn't be the first time
somebody lied about drug use.

379
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,207
(Kutner)
He has no reason to lie.

380
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:33,208
He knows he's sick.

381
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:34,743
His job doesn't drug test.

382
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,944
No relationship.
His daughter wouldn't find out.

383
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:37,279
Maybe he just forgot.

384
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:39,681
Forgot he did cocaine?

385
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,584
You're going with forgot
over lying?

386
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,086
Fits.

387
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,255
Cocaine explains
the narcolepsy.

388
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,690
Narcolepsy explains
the sleepwalking.

389
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,459
Whatever is in the cocaine
other than the cocaine

390
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:51,793
explains the memory loss.

391
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,028
Dealers cut this stuff
with all kinds of garbage.

392
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,030
Great, we'll start him
on immediate treatment

393
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,298
for all kinds of garbage.

394
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:57,466
You can narrow it down
in the lab.

395
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:00,702
Not without a sample.
So get a sample.

396
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,838
You want us to score cocaine
from a drug dealer?

397
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:03,839
It's exciting.

398
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:04,840
It's a fony.

399
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,142
It's necessary.

400
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:12,080
(Cameron)
There she is.

401
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,049
Amniotic fluid
looks good.

402
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,085
Good fetal movement.
Heart's beating nicely.

403
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:18,020
Heh.

404
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,326
What?

405
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:26,695
It looks like
pulmonary hypoplasia.

406
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:27,896
What's that?

407
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,631
The baby's lungs
are underdeveloped.

408
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:30,632
She won't be able
to breath on her own.

409
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:32,034
She might die?

410
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,201
I don't know.

411
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:34,403
If she was born today,
she'd be in trouble,

412
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:36,204
but we're not gonna let
that happen.

413
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:38,273
We'll put you on magnesium
to prevent labor

414
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,908
and steroids
to grow the lungs.

415
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,477
It's a good thing
Dr. Cuddy brought you in.

416
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,916
(Taub) How do you know
what a drug dealer looks like?

417
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,751
I'm not doing drugs,
if that's what you're asking.

418
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,386
I just noticed
that she had cash in her hand.

419
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:52,988
Obviously came from him.

420
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:54,089
Obviously didn't have
enough time

421
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,757
to perform
any other services.

422
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,658
I didn't notice
her holding--

423
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:59,995
there she is.

424
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:04,333
Uh, we're not cops.

425
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:05,767
Cops aren't allowed to say that,
right?

426
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,403
Yeah, they can say it.
Oh.

427
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,404
But if you were a cop,
you'd know that.

428
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:10,973
What do you want?

429
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,642
Um--ahem.

430
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,678
I would like to buy
some cocaine, please.

431
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:18,113
Oh, definitely
not a cop.

432
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:27,189
Thank you.

433
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:28,156
Wait.

434
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,366
It's good.

435
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:38,934
Glad you like it, Pablo.
Now can we go?

436
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,669
No.
You gave us the wrong stuff.

437
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:42,237
What are you talking about?
You got my best.

438
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:43,271
I know.

439
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:44,373
I don't want the good

440
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,407
"get your new customer
hooked" stuff.

441
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:46,842
I want the stepped on

442
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:47,876
"keep the old customer coming
back for more" stuff.

443
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,077
Are you crazy, bitch?

444
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:50,345
No, I'm a just a bitch

445
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:52,447
who knows what she wants.

446
00:18:54,282 --> 00:18:55,417
[Squeaks]

447
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:58,320
Looks like this kid thing

448
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,589
is really working out
for you.

449
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:01,890
All of the shopping,
none of the stretch marks.

450
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:03,592
Not a good time.

451
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,694
Right, kid's
getting worse.

452
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,696
Blessing in disguise.

453
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,231
Although a completely
predictable one.

454
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:10,999
You take in strays,

455
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,000
don't be surprised
by the worms.

456
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,669
Still wearing
the sweater.

457
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,770
I didn't say
you weren't stubborn.

458
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:16,271
I said
you weren't maternal.

459
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,407
Thank you.
Go away.

460
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:20,642
You're getting crankier.
- Baby's sick.

461
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,177
Sorry m not finding
the fun in that.

462
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,079
Is it really worth it?

463
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:28,016
Just for the pursuit
of unconditional love?

464
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,385
Only you could see that
as a bad thing.

465
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:32,954
It's a fake thing.
There's no unconditional love.

466
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:34,156
It's just unconditional need.

467
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:35,524
Don't make this child

468
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,992
a victim
of your biological clock.

469
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,428
Victim?

470
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:41,496
You think she's
better off staying--

471
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:42,731
Yes!

472
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:44,466
Because at least she knows

473
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,468
she's not qualified
for the job.

474
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,241
Let me guess.

475
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:55,277
I'm gonna tell her not
to play ball in the house,

476
00:19:55,343 --> 00:19:56,478
but she's not gonna listen.

477
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:59,147
No, actually,
I was going for

478
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:01,383
she sneaks her boyfriend in
while you're sleeping,

479
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,718
and he wants to do it
on the desk.

480
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,152
And at first she says no,

481
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:06,221
but she has issues
with self-esteem.

482
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,689
You know
you're gonna pay for that.

483
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:08,757
I'm paying for it
right now.

484
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:11,293
With wisdom.

485
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:13,762
Get out.

486
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,207
We found lactose.

487
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:26,541
The coke was cut
with milk powder.

488
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,443
Makes it nutritious.

489
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,145
Not much of a toxin.

490
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:31,379
It is if he's
allergic to milk.

491
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:33,482
He's not.
He has milk in his fridge.

492
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:34,716
How does
he like his coffee?

493
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:36,151
I don't know.
What does that--

494
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:38,053
what type of cereal's
in the cabinet?

495
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,222
Cocoa-something.
Why, what does it matter?

496
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:41,957
He likes his coffee black.
Milk's for the kid.

497
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,325
How can you be sure?

498
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,659
Because if he drank
the milk,

499
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:45,994
he'd know
that he's lactose intolerant.

500
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:48,396
Ask him, then treat him
for allergic reaction.

501
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:50,098
If he gets better,

502
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,666
we all get
to go home early.

503
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:56,471
Steroids make you
more prone to infection.

504
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:58,573
You'll have to stay here
for the new two weeks

505
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,575
so we can monitor you.

506
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:04,546
The baby's lungs, is that
because of...the meth?

507
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:06,414
Could be.

508
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,917
You must hate me.

509
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,827
If you'd done everything
right in your life,

510
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:20,529
I wouldn't be getting
a baby.

511
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,835
You're not scared?

512
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:28,236
I am scared.

513
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:32,007
You got, like,
this perfect life.

514
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:34,709
Not yet.

515
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:38,547
[Beeping]
What's that?

516
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:41,049
Heart rate's climbing.

517
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:44,419
What's wrong with her?

518
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:48,557
It's not the baby.
It's you.

519
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,295
I need two units
of O-negative, stat!

520

[Door opens]

521
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:05,616
The mother had stage two
placental abruption.

522
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:10,454
She's losing blood.

523
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,089
So deliver the baby.

524
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:15,025
The lungs are
ten weeks premature.

525
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:22,065
So deliver now,
risk the baby.

526
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,067
Deliver later,
risk the mom.

527
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,970
It's not your baby yet.
It's not your call.

528

She'll do whatever
I tell her to do.

Self-worth issues.
That's genetic, you know.

530
00:22:36,513 --> 00:22:38,248
You should deliver now.

531
00:22:40,517 --> 00:22:43,720
Right.

532
00:22:43,787 --> 00:22:45,756
Are you serious?

533
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,557
You're not?

00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:50,493
You just told me--
the wrong answer.

535
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,895
You can give the mom
more blood.

536
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:53,397
You can't give
the fetus more lungs.

537
00:22:53,463 --> 00:22:54,631
The lungs might work.

538
00:22:54,698 --> 00:22:55,732
It's the right
decision medically.

539
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,368
And yet you're here.

540
00:22:58,435 --> 00:23:02,739
To get your opinion,
not to get jerked around.

541
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:04,707
See, this is what's
screwed up here.

542
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:06,943
You're not sure that this
is the right call,

543
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,678
but you are sure that this
is what you want to tell her.

544
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:10,480
And that scares you

545
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,783
because your motives
aren't medical.

546
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,118
Some part of you
doesn't want this baby,

547
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,654
and that part
wants to tell her to kill it.

548
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:21,992
This is
an impossible situation.

549
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:24,761
I'm advising her to take
the safest route.

550
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:27,164
Right.

551
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,733
Doesn't explain why
you changed your sweater.

552
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:47,517
I need your advice.

553
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:49,653
It's not cancer.

554
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,154
Wow!

555
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,557
Can you remove spleens
with your mind too?

556
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:54,624
You're here to talk
about Cuddy.

557
00:23:54,691 --> 00:23:55,959
The file is a pretext.

558
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:57,327
Why the hell haven't you come

559
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,962
to talk to me about Cuddy?

560
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:01,264
I've been doing all sorts
of insane stuff.

561
00:24:01,331 --> 00:24:02,466
If she can't handle
your insanity,

562
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:03,667
she can't handle a baby.

563
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,402
That's exactly
my point.

564
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:06,670
No, it isn't.

565
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:07,838
You're feeling threatened

566
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,139
because she's going on
to high school

567
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:11,508
and leaving you behind
to repeat the eighth grade.

568
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,542
She's sleeping
with the math teacher

569
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:13,543
to get a diploma.

570
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,579
Adoption is cheating?

571
00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:16,580
Are they giving her
a fake kid?

572
00:24:16,646 --> 00:24:17,748
That's the problem.

573
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:19,383
She gets to have
a relationship with a kid,

574
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:21,251
but she can't handle one
with an adult.

575
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:23,086
So she's gonna kill it.

576
00:24:23,153 --> 00:24:26,189
Well, it does seem cleaner.

577
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,459
I've seen the file.
She's making a judgment call.

578
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:31,128
Decisions are never made
in a vacuum.

579
00:24:31,194 --> 00:24:34,498
Just like your decision
to make her miserable.

580
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:36,233
You're doing this
because we no longer

581
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,235
have inkwells and Cuddy
doesn't have pigtails.

582
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,375
Why do you think
I did that?

583
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:53,283
How you doing?

584
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,652
Not sure.

585
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:58,221
Been keeping an eye
on the clock like you said.

586
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,890
I don't think I lost
any time.

587
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,158
The machinery
agrees with you.

588
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:02,959
That means your problems
were caused by the coke.

589
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:04,961
Can't believe
I did coke.

590
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:06,096
You were asleep.

591
00:25:06,163 --> 00:25:07,764
I chose to do coke.

592
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:09,266
In your sleep.

593
00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:10,700
You weren't responsible.

594
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,403
Something inside me
wanted to do it.

595
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,838
Something inside of me
didn't think it was wrong.

596
00:25:14,905 --> 00:25:16,339
It's like a dream.

597
00:25:16,406 --> 00:25:17,674
We all do stuff
in our dreams

598
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:18,775
we wouldn't do
when we're awake.

599
00:25:18,842 --> 00:25:19,776
I don't.

600
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,183
What's that?

601
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:35,525
Did I fall asleep
and hurt myself?

602
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:37,527
I don't see any cuts.

603
00:25:37,594 --> 00:25:38,862
Because there aren't any.

604
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:42,732
I think...
you're sweating blood.

605
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:48,738
Guy's bleeding
out of his pores.

606
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:50,674
What does that tell us?

607
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,943
Other than you don't want
to play basketball against him

608
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,811
and he's dying?

609
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:56,780
(Foreman) And neither cocaine
or allergies are the answer.

610
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,315
(Kutner) It's gotta be systemic.
Hemorrhagic virus, maybe?

611
00:25:58,381 --> 00:25:59,916
(Thirteen)
You think it's Ebola?

612
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:00,984
His white blood cell count
would be through the roof.

613
00:26:01,051 --> 00:26:02,352
It's not an infection.

614
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:03,520
D.I.C.?

615
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:05,055
Coags are normal.

616
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:07,557
It's cancer.
Leukemia explains everything.

617
00:26:07,624 --> 00:26:09,259
(Kutner)
No fever. The bleeding.

618
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:10,594
No weight loss.
The rash.

619
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,928
No headache.
the fatigue.

620
00:26:11,995 --> 00:26:14,764
Leukemia'd be obvious
from the CBC.

621
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:15,832
Leukemia has false negatives
all the time.

622
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:22,072
So we have four reasons
for leukemia,

623
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:23,340
four reasons against.

624
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:25,609
Only need one against.

625
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:27,711
Yeah, if we had one reason
for anything else.

626
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:29,145
Go do a bone marrow
biopsy.

627
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,954
What would you do?

628
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:43,627
I think...

629
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:45,595
I think you should wait.

630
00:26:45,662 --> 00:26:48,431
But if I wait...

631
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:49,900
I could die.

632
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:52,235
There would be
more danger for you, but--

633
00:26:52,302 --> 00:26:56,306
is this your opinion
as a doctor or as a mother?

634
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:59,476
It's my medical opinion.

635
00:26:59,543 --> 00:27:00,844
It's my personal opinion--

636
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:04,347
[sobbing]
I don't want to wait.

637
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,150
It might only be one week.

638
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:09,586
We will keep you on plasma.

639
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:11,755
This is not my baby.

640
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:14,324
I have already sacrificed

641
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:18,461
nine months
for this stupid mistake.

642
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:22,699
I don't--I don't want
to sacrifice any more.

643
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,268
Becca, you asked my opinion

644
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:28,572
because you wanted to do
the right thing.

645
00:27:28,638 --> 00:27:30,807
You are giving up this baby

646
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:32,776
because you don't want
to make the mistakes

647
00:27:32,842 --> 00:27:35,512
your mom made,
her mom made.

648
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:38,248
You have a chance
to break this cycle

649
00:27:38,315 --> 00:27:41,217
to do something great
for this baby.

650
00:27:45,755 --> 00:27:47,257
No.

651
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,634
I need you
to hold still.

652
00:27:57,701 --> 00:27:58,702
Unh.

653
00:27:58,768 --> 00:28:04,074
Wait.

654
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,377
Have you been testing
any tanning creams or sprays?

655
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:10,413
No.

656
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,816
It's not a tan.

657
00:28:12,882 --> 00:28:14,918
Means it's not leukemia.

658
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,092
(Kutner) Chem panel confirms
kidney failure, end stage.

659
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,527
Got him on dialysis?

660
00:28:24,594 --> 00:28:26,829
BP's too low.
Too bad.

661
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:28,397
It would've been nice

662
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:29,565
to have more than an hour
or two to solve this thing

663
00:28:29,632 --> 00:28:30,833
hemachromatosis?

664
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,068
He have tiny testes?

665
00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:33,402
No. Scleroderma.

666
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:35,371
His skin's darker,
not lighter.

667
00:28:35,438 --> 00:28:38,241
As much fun as 20 questions
tends to be,

668
00:28:38,307 --> 00:28:40,309
he's blowing blood
out of every orifice,

669
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:41,377
you think it just
might be vascular?

670
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:42,879
Vasculitis?

671
00:28:42,945 --> 00:28:45,448
If I had said it might be
"vitas gerular,"

672
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,450
would you have said
"vitas gerulaitis?"

673
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,952
Test him for vasculitis,
angio and blood.

674
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,454
Even if we're right,

675
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,488
he's gonna need
a kidney transplant.

676
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:54,056
Test the daughter.

677
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:55,224
She's 12.

678
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,357
Small kidney.

679
00:28:56,392 --> 00:28:57,627
It just means he won't pee
as much.

680
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:58,928
Great for road trips.

681
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:00,329
I meant she's a minor

682
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:01,831
and daddy has a conflict,

683
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:03,232
so we're gonna need
Cuddy's signoff.

684
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:04,233
So get it.

685
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,602
She's...kind of busy.

686
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,874
(chase)
Clamp.

687
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:22,418
Suction.

688
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,656
Entering
the abdominal cavity.

689
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:29,325
There's the head.

690
00:29:35,198 --> 00:29:37,133
(House)
Got a minute?

691
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,968
Get out of here.

692
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:40,836
Who's that?
(Chase)- Dr. Gregory House.

693
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:42,872
He's the one you'll be suing
when you develop sepsis.

694
00:29:42,939 --> 00:29:44,307
Well, why is he here?

695
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:46,242
Better question is
why is she here?

696
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:48,044
You're an administrator.
Administrate.

697
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,912
I have a patient's daughter
needs a guardian ad litem.

698
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:51,581
That's it.
Tests are inconclusive.

699
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:52,515
But either way
he's gonna need--

700
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,649
House, get out!

701
00:29:53,716 --> 00:29:55,685
This doesn't need you.
I do.

702
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:58,821
Head's out.

703
00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:00,256
Later.
Later's too late.

704
00:30:04,627 --> 00:30:07,196
And there she is.

705
00:30:09,465 --> 00:30:10,633
(Cuddy)
Come on, cry.

706
00:30:15,838 --> 00:30:17,206
Come on.

707
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:21,477
Come on.

708
00:30:21,544 --> 00:30:26,048
Joy, cry.

709
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,250
Cry, joy.

710
00:30:27,316 --> 00:30:30,319
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

711
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:36,359
[Baby crying]

712
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:38,461
(Chase)
That's the sound we like to hear

713
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:41,097
Blood count's
nine out of ten.

714
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:43,799
You hear that?

715
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:45,334
You just got
your first "A."

716
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:47,503
[Cuddy laughs]

717
00:30:50,706 --> 00:30:54,610
She's...yours now.

718
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:07,723
Mazel Tov.

719
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,426
Now it's time
to say those magic words

720
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,028
you'll be telling her
for the rest of her life.

721
00:31:12,094 --> 00:31:14,030
Mommy's gotta go to work.

722
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,236
(Cuddy) Have the risks
of the transplant procedure

723
00:31:20,303 --> 00:31:21,837
been explained to you?

724
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:23,306
Damn it.

725
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:24,840
I was hoping you
weren't going to ask her that.

726
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:26,442
Of course she knows.

727
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,177
Can you just sign
the paperwork?

728
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:31,180
Dr. House explained to you
that all surgeries carry risk?

729
00:31:31,247 --> 00:31:32,815
You could die.

730
00:31:32,882 --> 00:31:33,916
And if you don't do it,
Daddy will die.

731
00:31:33,983 --> 00:31:35,117
Stop pressuring her.

732
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,720
Sorry.
Daddy's perfectly healthy.

733
00:31:37,787 --> 00:31:39,288
But we want you
to give him a kidney anyway

734
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,857
because it'd be cool
if he had three.

735
00:31:41,924 --> 00:31:42,925
Shut up.

736
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:48,097
Do you understand the risks
of living with one kidney?

737
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:49,465
Yeah.

738
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,367
And you still want to proceed
with the transplant?

739
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:52,501
Yeah.

740
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:59,742
Okay, go ahead.

741
00:32:04,113 --> 00:32:05,481
No.

742
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,750
I'm saying
you can proceed.

743
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:09,585
I'm saying I can't.

744
00:32:13,823 --> 00:32:16,726
Whatever he has,
she has too.

745
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:19,128
She's sleepwalking.

746
00:32:24,086 --> 00:32:25,187
(Kutner)
If we don't give him a new kidney,

747
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:26,288
he's dead in a week.

748
00:32:26,354 --> 00:32:27,522
We have to transplant.

749
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:29,925
When your remote
has a dead battery,

750
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:32,060
you don't replace it
with another dead battery.

751
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:34,329
Whatever's killing
the dad's kidneys

752
00:32:34,396 --> 00:32:36,531
is gonna kill
the kid's too.

753
00:32:36,598 --> 00:32:38,066
It is possible the sleep issues
aren't medically related.

754
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:41,470
Maybe they're both insomniacs
due to the turnpike noise.

755
00:32:41,536 --> 00:32:44,206
Maybe they both drink
too much coffee, maybe--

756
00:32:44,272 --> 00:32:46,041
House is right.
How do you know?

757
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:47,742
Because the daughter's
sweating blood.

758
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:49,211
If they have the same thing,

759
00:32:49,277 --> 00:32:50,712
it means there has to be
a common cause.

760
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,014
Which means it has to be
a toxin, infection,

761
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:54,382
or genetic.

762
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:55,984
And since we've ruled out
infections and toxins--

763
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:58,553
it narrows it down to any one
of a dozen genetic disorders,

764
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,889
each of which takes more
than a week to run.

765
00:33:00,956 --> 00:33:03,425
Call Foreman.
Get to work.

766
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,266
(Wilson)
Cuddy is positively aglow.

767
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:12,701
What's your theory?

768
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:14,703
She's only acting happy
to make you miserable?

769
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:16,438
I need a genetic disease.

770
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:18,406
I'm sure
you're carrying a few.

771
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:22,377
Symptoms are kidney failure,
bleeding, and insomnia.

772
00:33:22,444 --> 00:33:24,012
You paid off the pool?

773
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,814
Technically, anyone
who didn't enter is a winner.

774
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:27,516
It's not over yet.

775
00:33:27,582 --> 00:33:30,585
Everyone's happy until they
unwrap that pretty present

776
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:32,621
and find they got a wall clock
in the shape of Africa.

777
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:34,356
Adoption's a cheat,
remember?

778
00:33:34,422 --> 00:33:36,124
There's no real pregnancy,

779
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:37,893
so there's no stranded
dopamine receptors,

780
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:40,295
so there's
no postpartum depression.

781
00:33:40,362 --> 00:33:43,798
Cuddy will be the happiest
new mother you've ever seen.

782
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:50,972
I've just given you
the answer, haven't I?

783
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,040
And now you're going
to walk out of here

784
00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:54,876
without saying a word.

785
00:33:54,943 --> 00:33:56,444
Nope!

786
00:33:59,347 --> 00:34:00,715
(House)
Good news.

787
00:34:00,782 --> 00:34:03,118
I know what you have,

788
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:05,820
and you're both
gonna be fine.

789
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:08,123
What?
Are you serious?

790
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,791
Yes and no.

791
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:13,028
So you do know what they have?
Yeah.

792
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,429
(Foreman)
But they aren't gonna be fine?

793
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:15,697
No idea.

794
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:17,098
They might be.

795
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:18,567
Why the hell would you
say they were?

796
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:20,335
To make them happy.

797
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:22,103
(Foreman)
For two seconds?

798
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,239
Technically, to see
if they can be happy.

799
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:27,576
We should've seen
a grin, a twinkle,

800
00:34:27,642 --> 00:34:28,677
a sigh of relief,
something.

801
00:34:28,743 --> 00:34:30,245
They're sick.
They're tired.

802
00:34:30,312 --> 00:34:32,280
They're anhedonic,

803
00:34:32,347 --> 00:34:34,249
incapable of experiencing
pleasure.

804
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:35,951
Something's bushwhacked
their dopamine receptors.

805
00:34:36,017 --> 00:34:37,252
They're depressed.

806
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,853
Mom's dead.
Dad's dying.

807
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,590
You should know
that being bummed

808
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:43,258
isn't necessarily
a pathology.

809
00:34:43,325 --> 00:34:45,493
Being bummed doesn't explain
their lack of friends

810
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,028
or their indifference
to each other.

811
00:34:47,095 --> 00:34:48,630
Why their place
had no music,

812
00:34:48,697 --> 00:34:50,899
no view, no decor.

813
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,422
But if you can't feel pleasure,
what's with the cocaine?

814
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:52,601
Really?

815
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,869
Is that why you do drugs?
Because you're happy?

816
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:57,405
Most people do 'em
because they want to be happy.

817
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:00,175
His subconscious craved it,
needed it.

818
00:35:00,242 --> 00:35:01,943
Most common cause
of anhedonia is schizophrenia.

819
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:02,978
Sure, in white folk.

820
00:35:03,044 --> 00:35:06,982
They're black?

821
00:35:07,048 --> 00:35:08,283
They're liars.

822
00:35:11,253 --> 00:35:12,621
What's your name?

823
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:15,257
Jerry Harmon.

824
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:18,226
Your real name.

825
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:19,327
Hosarian?

826
00:35:19,394 --> 00:35:20,762
Herzog?

827
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,297
H'ali-baba?

828
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:23,999
Hammoud.

829
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,438
Jamal Hammoud.

830
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:33,375
Changed it
when we invaded Iraq

831
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:34,476
the first time.

832
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:35,710
How'd you know?

833
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:37,679
You and your daughter

834
00:35:37,746 --> 00:35:41,016
have familial
Mediterranean fever.

835
00:35:41,082 --> 00:35:42,584
It's a genetic disease

836
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:44,219
contracted by people
of Mediterranean descent.

837
00:35:44,286 --> 00:35:47,122
Sephardic Jews,
Armenians, Arabs.

838
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:49,891
Causes anhedonia,
seizures, kidney failure,

839
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,393
even lactose intolerance.

840
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:53,762
Symptoms are set off
by age and stress.

841
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:55,096
Kid couldn't get happy,

842
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:57,065
but she could get stressed
by daddy dying.

843
00:35:57,132 --> 00:35:58,600
You don't know
if we'll get better?

844
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,568
Treatment tends to be
hit and miss

845
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:04,105
once you reach
the sweating blood stage.

846
00:36:04,172 --> 00:36:06,308
Start them on colchicine
and melphalan.

847
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:08,943
His kidneys
are fried.

848
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,646
If he doesn't have FMF,
the colchicine will kill him.

849
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,381
Boy, sure hope I'm right.

850
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:01,463
Mr. Harmon?

851
00:37:01,529 --> 00:37:03,398
Mr. Harmon, I need you
to open your eyes.

852
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:09,104
Feeling better?

853
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:24,386
How's Samantha?

854
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:27,155
Healthy enough
to toss you a kidney.

855
00:37:27,222 --> 00:37:30,558
Dad?
Sammy.

856
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,461
[Laughter]

857
00:37:51,012 --> 00:37:52,614
The baby's doing great.

858
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,750
I...

859
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:58,453
I can't imagine how hard
this must be for you.

860
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,724
I was--I was stupid
and selfish.

861
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:03,792
You were scared.

862
00:38:03,858 --> 00:38:06,327
Yeah, but you
wouldn't have been.

863
00:38:06,394 --> 00:38:08,963
That's not true.

864
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,231
Well, I mean,
you would've been scared,

865
00:38:10,298 --> 00:38:14,569
but...you would've done
the right thing anyway.

866
00:38:14,636 --> 00:38:18,206
And I want to be like that.

867
00:38:20,942 --> 00:38:23,445
I don't--I don't want to be
a loser.

868
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:25,480
You're not a loser.

869
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:30,318
When I saw you hold her

870
00:38:30,385 --> 00:38:33,822
and the look
on your face,

871
00:38:33,888 --> 00:38:35,924
it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

872
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,798
And that's
when I realized...

873
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:45,733
I can't.

874
00:38:50,772 --> 00:38:52,407
Becca.

875
00:38:54,242 --> 00:38:57,312
My life, it's always been
about pain, and anger,

876
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,113
and disappointment,

877
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,949
never about love.

878
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:04,752
And that's when I realized,
you know, it could be.

879
00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:08,590
And I can't give
that away.

880
00:39:08,656 --> 00:39:10,058
Becca, don't do this.

881
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:18,967
Uh...

882
00:39:21,135 --> 00:39:22,704
what you're feeling
is natural.

883
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,039
But you're filled

884
00:39:25,106 --> 00:39:28,142
with hormones,
and emotion, and fear,

885
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:30,445
and...

886
00:39:30,512 --> 00:39:32,514
you just can't make a huge
decision like this right now.

887
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,115
You have to give it
some time.

888
00:39:34,182 --> 00:39:38,987
I am...I'm so sorry.

889
00:39:43,124 --> 00:39:45,326
It's a decision
that changes everything.

890
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:50,331
Changes the rest
of your life.

891
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,303
I hope so.

892
00:40:56,129 --> 00:40:57,664
[Knock on front door]

893
00:41:06,406 --> 00:41:08,909
It's really not
the greatest time for gloating.

894
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,619
There's more
than one baby in the sea.

895
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,687
The world is full
of teenage boys

896
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:22,856
riding bareback.

897
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:24,825
No.

898
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:27,561
I'm done.

899
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:28,695
I can't go through
that again.

900
00:41:28,762 --> 00:41:31,798
You're quitting.

901
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,100
Just like you quit IVF.

902
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,768
Yeah, just like that.

903
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:36,670
There, you just
did it again.

904
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:43,977
It's too bad.

905
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:47,514
You would've made
a great mother.

906
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,854
You son of a bitch.

907
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,722
When I was getting
a baby,

908
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:58,091
you told me
I'd suck as a mother.

909
00:41:58,158 --> 00:41:59,860
Now that I've lost it,

910
00:41:59,926 --> 00:42:02,729
you tell me I'd be great
as a mother.

911
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:06,007
Why do you need to
negate everything?

912
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,906
[Softly]
I don't know.

913
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:42,235
Good night.

914
00:42:45,806 --> 00:42:48,041
[Door opens]
Good night.

915
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,743
[Door closes]
