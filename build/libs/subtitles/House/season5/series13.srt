1
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:24,856
Let's stay focused, Johnny.

2
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:28,993
What are you looking at?

3
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:30,762
Who is she?

4
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,364
That's Miss Cindy,

5
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:34,799
<i>Zeke's new aide.</i>

6
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:36,301
What happened
to his old aide?

7
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:38,636
She got married.

8
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:40,705
<i>So, first,</i>

9
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:43,508
you want to rub the
glue on the paper

10
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:47,007
in any shapes
you like.

11
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:49,214
Why do people get married?

12
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:51,282
Because they love each other.

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,851
Why aren't you married?

14
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:55,920
I haven't found
the person I love yet,

15
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:59,357
because I spend
all of my time loving you.

16
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,361
Does that mean
we can get married?

17
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:08,066
Well, love comes in many types,

18
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,400
<i>and there's lots of it</i>

19
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:10,802
<i>to go around.</i>

20
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,372
Oh, my snow is ruined.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,974
It's not ruined.

22
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,144
Oh, it's pretty.

23
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,446
See, look, I like the green.

24
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,047
Who ever heard of green snow?

25
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:24,616
It's magical.

26
00:01:30,422 --> 00:01:32,757
Come here.

27
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:35,026
We'll get you cleaned up, okay?

28
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:38,163
It's okay.

29
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,332
Ooh, are you okay?

30
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,574
Oh.

31
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,312
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

32
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,923
You gonna pay for that?

33
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:41,392
Nice of you to offer.

34
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,261
Now I can actually get
some cream cheese.

35
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,629
29-year-old teacher--

36
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,197
she works
with special needs children.

37
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,233
She--
- Love what you're wearing.

38
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,268
Brings out the blue
of the case file,

39
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,003
which means it's not
from the E.R.

40
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,238
So why are you here?

41
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,807
Because Dr. Cuddy is not here.

42
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,975
She's decided to spend
some more time

43
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,443
at home with the baby
for a while.

44
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,411
I'm taking over some of her
day-to-day responsibilities,

45
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,447
like babysitting you.

46
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,382
Interesting.

47
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,551
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

48
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,720
So why would Cuddy want you
to die so young?

49
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:11,356
She figured I'd spent
three years working for you.

50
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:12,457
I was inoculated.

51
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:14,993
Good.

52
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,127
Fun.

53
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,396
You get to exercise
your newfound power.

54
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,131
I squirm under your thumb,

55
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,799
resent the student
becoming the teacher,

56
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,201
and then push comes to shove,

57
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,337
and we all get to realize
what our real roles should be.

58
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:27,972
Then you put out.

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,375
That's why I took the job.

60
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:48,259
29-year-old Special Ed. teacher
coughs up blood

61
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,995
all over Corky.

62
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:52,997
<i>No dyspnea,</i>
<i>no weight loss.</i>

63
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:55,033
Why are you smirking?

64
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,434
Never thought
I'd see the day

65
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,803
you were taking orders
from Cameron.

66
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,505
Cameron's in charge?
- When did that happen?

67
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:02,140
<i> You're gonna destroy her,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

68
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:04,409
I am going to do my job.

69
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,978
If that involves
leaving her a rotting pulp...

70
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,846
Cameron's gonna mark
her territory.

71
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:10,181
<i>She'll probably overcompensate</i>
<i>and destroy you.</i>

72
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,916
Bleeding ulcer.

73
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:13,451
Scope of the stomach
and lungs were clean,

74
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,253
yet she continues
to spit up blood

75
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,454
from both
her stomach and lungs.

76
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:17,789
That means it's probably
something wrong

77
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:18,923
with the blood itself--

78
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:20,625
Leukemia,
Von Willebrand's.

79
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,093
Thoracic tumor
is a better fit.

80
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,962
Erodes into her airway
and esophagus--

81
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,964
Oh, will you two
stop it already?

82
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:28,333
Stop what?
- Disagreeing.

83
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,601
Okay, which one of us
shouldn't have an opinion?

84
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:31,736
<i>It's not an opinion.</i>

85
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,204
It's a smoke screen.

86
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:35,640
<i>Toss out a lame idea,</i>
<i>instead of agreeing</i>

87
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,075
with Foreman's better idea
because you're worried

88
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:39,610
that'll confirm
that he's boldly gone

89
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:41,512
where no man
has gone before.

90
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,281
You slept
with Foreman?

91
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,782
Sorry.
You were busy.

92
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,117
Drop it, House.

93
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,086
We're seeing each other,
end of discussion.

94
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,187
Anything else
isn't relevant.

95
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:51,622
It's extremely relevant.

96
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,458
Apparently,
it colors everything.

97
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,927
<i>Now I have no idea</i>
<i>if you have differing opinions</i>

98
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,161
because you have
differing opinions

99
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,596
or because
you're just trying to prove

100
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:00,098
that you can think
for yourselves.

101
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,300
How about you just judge
our ideas on their own merit?

102
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,602
Oh, you don't want me
to do that.

103
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,437
<i>Go run</i>
<i>a bleeding-time test,</i>

104
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,573
<i>confirm our patient's blood</i>
<i>is screwy.</i>

105
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,707
Then you can come back

106
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:12,276
and pretend to disagree
about why.

107
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,183
Time Zero.

108
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:22,320
I'm impressed.
You didn't even flinch.

109
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,455
I just went to my happy place.

110
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:28,459
We cannot let House
anywhere near this woman.

111
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:29,761
Where is your happy place?

112
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,429
My class,

113
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,630
<i>with them.</i>

114
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:33,898
<i>Passed the first mark.</i>

115
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,066
It's a great thing you do.

116
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,634
Not really.

117
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:39,003
<i>Most kids,</i>
<i>typical children--</i>

118
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:42,507
you hand them a pair
of scissors, and they cut.

119
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:44,108
<i>Well, Tony--</i>
<i>he's got C.P.,</i>

120
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:46,611
<i>and when I gave him</i>
<i>the scissors,</i>

121
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:48,913
we went
on a journey together,

122
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,149
learning to get his fingers
in those holes,

123
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:54,018
<i>to hold the scissors apart,</i>
<i>to hold the paper.</i>

124
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:56,354
I mean, when
he finally learned to cut,

125
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,490
we both just wept with joy.

126
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,663
If you ever meet our boss,
just yes or no answers, okay?

127
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:10,802
It's not slowing up.
No sign of clotting.

128
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,571
So there is something wrong
with my blood?

129
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,074
Don't worry,
we'll run some lab tests

130
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,125
<i>to find out which clotting
factor is off and then--</i>

131
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,109
I'm not worried.

132
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,611
Must be one hell of a happy place.

133
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,254
She's beautiful.

134
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:32,990
I know. I'm lucky.

135
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,860
<i>Absolutely.</i>

136
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,462
What's she like?

137
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,199
She's eight weeks old.

138
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:44,001
Are you asking me about her
politics or her sense of humor?

139
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:45,236
My cousin had a kid.

140
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,537
They acted
like they knew the thing

141
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:48,239
from the time
it was two minutes old.

142
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,373
I just--
I just thought--

143
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,676
She cries, she eats,
and she poops.

144
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:03,788
What's wrong?

145
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,126
I don't feel anything.

146
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:12,130
You're tired.

147
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:13,731
<i>I'm not sleep deprived.</i>

148
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:16,033
She sleeps fine.

149
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:17,535
I'm obviously not hormonal.

150
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,876
I know I'm supposed to feel amazement.

151
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:26,377
I'm supposed to love her.

152
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,280
<i>I just...</i>

153
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,550
I don't feel
anything at all.

154
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,421
Sorry.

155
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:39,056
Maybe I am just tired.

156
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,359
<i>Um...</i>

157
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,394
Thank you for stopping by.
I'm okay.

158
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:44,896
<i>Lisa...</i>

159
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:47,532
If you're...

160
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,967
I am feeding her,

161
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:53,271
I'm changing her,
and I'm burping her.

162
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:55,072
<i>I'm doing everything</i>
<i>I'm supposed to do.</i>

163
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,042
She will be okay.

164
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,278
Please go back to work.

165
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,157
OOD,

166
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,226
but the clotting proteins
aren't the problem.

167
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,895
It's her platelets, looked like
they had bite marks in them.

168
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,097
So now you're agreeing?

169
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:21,832
Either you folded
because I gave you crap,

170
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,234
or you broke up, or--

171
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,902
We disagree,
you blame our relationship.

172
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,837
We agree, you blame
our relationship.

173
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:28,673
Don't you see a problem there?
- Yes.

174
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,508
Don't you?
Could be lymphoma.

175
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,009
Not with normal LDH.

176
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:33,211
I.T.P. fits.

177
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:34,545
We should start her
on methotrexate.

178
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:37,648
Absolutely,
and total body irradiation.

179
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:39,483
Because she failed
a bleeding-time test?

180
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,085
<i>TBI will promote cancers,</i>

181
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,553
kill her digestive tract.

182
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,655
Don't forget--stop her
from bleeding into her brain.

183
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:47,024
It's premature, reckless,
and potentially lethal.

184
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:48,492
True.

185
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,860
Must be somebody's job

186
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:51,596
to stop me from being reckless
and irresponsible.

187
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,097
<i>Nobody can stop me</i>

188
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,565
from being premature.

189
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,005
Got a patient with I.T.P.

190
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,007
Need to hit her with radiation.

191
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,909
I'm gonna have to call you back.

192
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,143
<i>Methotrexate.</i>
- Good point.

193
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,445
<i>On the other hand,</i>

194
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:08,879
if she bleeds in her brain,

195
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:12,984
she's gonna need
a Special Ed. class of her own.

196
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,620
Fine.

197
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:16,954
Really?

198
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:18,956
Yeah, if you think
it's right, do it.

199
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,725
Hmm.

200
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:23,027
Some people thought
you were gonna be brutal,

201
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,262
marking your territory.

202
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:26,430
Who?
- <i>Nobody.</i>

203
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,699
Just because I call him nobody
doesn't make me a racist.

204
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,068
I'm not gonna play games.

205
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:32,436
If you come to me
with a request

206
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:34,105
and it makes medical sense,
I'll say yes.

207
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:37,341
I need oral sex.

208
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:39,844
I'm pretty sure

209
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:42,313
biological imperative
qualifies as medical sense.

210
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,815
Can I return my phone call now?

211
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:46,784
I don't really see
how that's gonna be possible.

212
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:01,832
<i> Patient won't respond</i>
<i>to methotrexate.</i>

213
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,401
Bleeding time hasn't improved.

214
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,036
You have a medical dilemma for me.

215
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:06,404
I have one for you.

216
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:09,073
I need a reason to not do
total body irradiation.

217
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,841
Other than that Cameron
said you can't.

218
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:11,909
She said I can.

219
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:13,611
Then why don't we just do it?

220
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,012
Because it's premature, reckless,

221
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,514
and potentially lethal.

222
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:18,749
Then why don't we
just don't do it?

223
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,318
Because that would let
Cameron in on the fact

224
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:21,585
that I never intended to do it.

225
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:24,088
This is gonna be convoluted,
isn't it?

226
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,823
I figured I'd ask
for something really crazy,

227
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,425
so she'd shoot me down
and get the whole

228
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:29,694
"I can control House" thing
out of her perky little system.

229
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,395
<i>So the next time</i>
<i>I went back</i>

230
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:33,197
<i>And asked for something</i>
<i>marginally crazy,</i>

231
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,833
it would seem marginally
reasonable, and she'd say yes.

232
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,536
So, yeah, slightly convoluted.

233
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,504
You're screwed.

234
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:41,639
Unless we irradiate her...

235
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:45,009
without the radiation.

236
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,178
We book the nuclear lab.
We fill out the paperwork.

237
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:48,512
We bring the patient down there.

238
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,714
We do everything
but flip the switch.

239
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:51,882
Go. Do.

240
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,217
Don't flip.

241
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,120
And is there anything
we should be doing, you know,

242
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,788
to actually help the patient?

243
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,223
<i>Trust me.</i>

244
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,025
In the long term,
this'll help all our patients.

245
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,393
In the short term,

246
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,295
double the dose of methotrexate
and add prednisone.

247
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:10,401
Cameron's got the keys
to the castle.

248
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,803
This trial I'm running--the drug
really seems to be working.

249
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:15,506
She's kind of liking the power.

250
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,842
I think I'm kind of liking her
liking it.

251
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,144
I'm not sure what I'm gonna do
about Thirteen.

252
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,246
She's sort of dressing
like Cuddy.

253
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,883
She's on the placebo.

254
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,284
You can't possibly know that.

255
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:28,986
Accidents happen.

256
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:30,187
I found out.

257
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,627
You cannot tell her.

258
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,296
You'd be compromising the trial.

259
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:42,233
She knows she had a 50/50 chance
of not being on the drug.

260
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,568
If you feel like you're lying
to her, too bad.

261
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,604
I don't want to tell her.

262
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,641
I want to put her
on the real drug.

263
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,145
And you want me to tell you
that that's okay?

264
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,247
Her trial results
are already compromised,

265
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,048
just from the fact that I know.

266
00:11:58,116 --> 00:11:59,683
As long as she's wasting
her time,

267
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:02,653
Why not give her something
that might actually help her?

268
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,288
Valid point,

269
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,923
except for the fact

270
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:10,027
That it's a load of crap.

271
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:13,764
Don't be an idiot.

272
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,943
So how long
until we start the procedure?

273
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,511
We already started.

274
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,147
Told you you wouldn't feel a thing.

275
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:33,284
You should lie back.
Just stay real still.

276
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:35,186
I'm afraid there
is someone sitting next to you.

277
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,388
oh, for--
God, God, God!

278
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:40,691
I have to pee.

279
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,127
Can we, like, call a
timeout for a minute,

280
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,295
let me go to the bathroom?

281
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:47,398
Yeah, sure.

282
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,533
We'll just start up again
when you're done.

283
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:50,835
Thanks.

284
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:53,838
Sorry. I-I didn't realize
I had to go.

285
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:56,106
No problem.

286
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,576
Sarah?

287
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:06,317
No pulse.
Get the paddles.

288
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:11,555
Clear!

289
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:16,393
Got a pulse.

290
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:18,462
It's not I.T.P.

291
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,870
<i> No structural defects</i>
<i>in her heart.</i>

292
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:28,371
<i> What about a calcified valve</i>
<i>or a patent foramen ovale?</i>

293
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:30,373
<i>Transthoracic echo and</i>
<i>bubble studies show nothing.</i>

294
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:31,441
Her heart's clean.

295
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:33,076
The patient said she had to go pee.

296
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:35,345
Maybe when she got up,
she started to urinate.

297
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:36,747
Increased the vagal tone,

298
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,248
caused arrhythmia,
and stopped her heart.

299
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:41,017
Who has to go pee in the middle
of a nuclear procedure?

300
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:42,886
It wasn't really
a nuclear procedure.

301
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:43,987
She didn't know that.

302
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,525
People don't die from peeing.

303
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:50,894
Heavy metal, toxin.

304
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:52,429
Drugs or alcohol.

305
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:54,531
Or her own body is making a toxin.

306
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:55,966
<i>Cold agglutinins--</i>

307
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:58,435
abnormal protein gets activated
by cold temperatures.

308
00:13:58,503 --> 00:13:59,936
Like the classroom
with the broken heater

309
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:01,605
and the cold metal table
in the procedure room.

310
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,206
Oh, for God's sake, get a room.

311
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:05,909
Immerse her in an ice bath.

312
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:07,944
The cold will activate
her cold agglutinins.

313
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:08,912
Causing her heart to race.

314
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,614
Confirming our diagnosis.

315
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:11,982
And giving her another heart attack.

316
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:14,017
Lucky for me,
there's a flaxen-haired maiden

317
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,252
who loves to say yes.

318
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,391
How in the world could you
approve total body irradiation

319
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:22,826
for a patient
with possible I.T.P.?

320
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:24,161
It was the right call.

321
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:25,695
There is no medical
justification for that kind of--

322
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:26,930
Not medically, no.

323
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:29,332
Absolutely
no medical rationalization.

324
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,801
I had to say yes

325
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:32,636
because House wanted me to say no.

326
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,437
You think he was bluffing.

327
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:35,972
I'm the new kid.
He had to test me.

328
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,607
Don't get cute.

329
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,075
Don't engage him.

330
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:42,078
Do not play his games,
because you will lose.

331
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:43,880
You hired me to do this job.
Let me do it.

332
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:49,653
Oh, I'm sorry.

333
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,188
Looks like you guys
are in the middle

334
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:52,689
of a conversation.

335
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:56,226
I can wait till Cuddy leaves.

336
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:58,428
You are gonna leave soon,
aren't you?

337
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:01,398
I mean, the nurses have got
your baby out there.

338
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:03,867
Not that they're gonna kidnap it
or anything,

339
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,237
but I figured that the new
mother brings the baby to work

340
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:08,772
<i>because she wants to listen</i>
<i>to all the cooing.</i>

341
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,774
If you're gonna wait,
you can wait outside.

342
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:14,644
Unless the new mother
brings the baby to work

343
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:16,079
<i>because she wants</i>
<i>to dump the baby,</i>

344
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:17,681
because she hates the baby

345
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:19,182
<i>and thinks she made</i>

346
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,218
a big mistake.

347
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:25,555
Can't trust that Wilson guy

348
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:28,558
<i>with anything.</i>

349
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:29,893
Lisa, are you--
- It's not a big deal.

350
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:31,194
I was having a bad day.

351
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,696
Is Wilson gonna be in trouble?

352
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:35,498
For betraying my trust
in a vulnerable time?

353
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:36,800
No.

354
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:37,901
Why would that bother me?

355
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:40,437
He was worried, made a bad choice.

356
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:45,041
It's not a big deal.

357
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,643
I know it seems like crap.

358
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:48,545
You probably feel like crap,
but it's not.

359
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:50,547
<i>Legally,</i>
<i>you haven't adopted her yet.</i>

360
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:51,915
<i>There's no obligations,</i>
<i>no strings.</i>

361
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:53,183
it can be undone tomorrow.

362
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:54,651
<i>Emotionally,</i>

363
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,219
you'll feel guilty
for a while,

364
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,555
<i>but the kid--</i>

365
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,523
she won't even know you existed.

366
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:02,559
You saying I should give her back?

367
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:05,795
Much better than having a mother
who doesn't give a crap.

368
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:08,498
Thanks.

369
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:12,168
I'm just gonna go drop it off
at the pound.

370
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:18,508
What did you want?

371
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,181
We got a green light.
Go draw the patient's blood.

372
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:26,549
Why?

373
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:28,251
To see if it clumps in the cold.

374
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:30,487
She's making you confirm
your theory before you treat?

375
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:32,289
She approved the bath.

376
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:34,324
Just thought we ought to do
a test to confirm.

377
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,793
That's more
of a yellow light, isn't it?

378
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:39,062
<i> So she let's you nuke</i>
<i>the patient, no problem,</i>

379
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,732
but makes you jump through hoops
to give her a bath?

380
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,534
Why would she do that?

381
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:45,902
I think she was playing you.

382
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,638
Go draw the blood.

383
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:56,446
Didn't realize the nurses
allowed any visitors in here.

384
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:57,781
They don't.

385
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,215
We'll just do these problems,

386
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:00,951
<i>And then you</i>
<i>have to go, okay?</i>

387
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:02,485
Okay.

388
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:03,853
I need to draw some blood.

389
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,655
<i>I had a crush on my teacher</i>

390
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:06,957
in fourth grade...

391
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:08,091
and fifth.

392
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,093
<i>It's more that</i>

393
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:12,395
Johnny was a nonverbal autistic.

394
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:14,364
<i>Then for Sarah,</i>

395
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:16,733
he talks,
makes eye contact.

396
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,301
He's like a regular kid.

397
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,303
<i>Since she got sick,</i>

398
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:22,405
he started going
back away from us.

399
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:23,807
I had to bring him in
for a visit.

400
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:25,575
I'll tell you what--

401
00:17:25,643 --> 00:17:28,745
I'll close the blinds so
the nurses don't ask questions.

402
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:30,847
You can stay as long as you want.

403
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:32,482
We should have the results
in about an hour.

404
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,450
I'll be here.

405
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:39,756
Good job.

406
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:42,058
One minute at 39 degrees.

407
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:45,295
Oh, damn, sorry.

408
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:47,063
You all right?

409
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:49,399
Don't be paranoid.

410
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,067
I feel great.

411
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:53,336
Didn't expect the meds
to work this quickly.

412
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:55,038
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

413
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:56,740
You might not even be
on the real drug.

414
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:58,875
Several patients
have shown improvement.

415
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:00,510
I know my test results
have been better.

416
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:02,178
I know I have more energy.

417
00:18:02,246 --> 00:18:04,214
You ever hear the term
placebo effect?

418
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,585
I guess I do have a few reasons
to feel good,

419
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,653
but...

420
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:12,455
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

421
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:13,823
You're good,

422
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,593
but not "curing Huntington's" good.

423
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:19,796
Good.

424
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:29,539
It's clumped.

425
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:32,142
House was right.
Ice bath's on.

426
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,577
<i> Got a sec?</i>

427
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:38,214
Don't be an idiot.

428
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:48,224
<i>I know it's hard,</i>

429
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,026
But you need to stay in there
for three minutes.

430
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:50,927
It's okay.

431
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:55,365
You come to procedures now?

432
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:59,235
Only the ones that might involve
stopping the patient's heart.

433
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:00,703
Cameron tell you to be here?

434
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:02,338
Shut up.

435
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:03,606
<i>Tell me about Jonathan.</i>

436
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:05,208
<i>How'd you get him</i>
<i>to come out of hiding?</i>

437
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:07,744
He was extremely
sensitive to touch,

438
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:11,548
yet he had a-a tactile
fascination with newspaper.

439
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:13,349
I mean, he wouldn't read it.

440
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,551
<i>He would just--</i>

441
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:17,020
<i>just touch it,</i>

442
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:18,388
<i>crinkle it.</i>

443
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:20,590
I thought maybe that was a way in,

444
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:23,126
Papier mache and...

445
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:24,627
Ohh.

446
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:26,196
And it was.

447
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:27,764
He let me into his world.

448
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,800
Please tell her that talking
will ruin the test.

449
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:33,236
All the kids--
I-I try

450
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:34,804
<i>to become a part of them,</i>

451
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:37,340
<i>and then have them</i>
<i>become a part of me.</i>

452
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:39,576
How much longer
till the heart attack?

453
00:19:39,643 --> 00:19:41,711
<i> I wanted to be a doctor from</i>
<i>the time I was eight years old.</i>

454
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:43,580
<i>Never wanted to be</i>
<i>a pediatrician, though.</i>

455
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:45,415
Now they're both talking.

456
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:47,417
<i> Well, I wanted to be</i>
<i>a sociologist.</i>

457
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:49,452
I was supposed to observe
a class.

458
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,654
I was sent to room 2--

459
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:53,423
214,

460
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,092
but I went to room 241 instead.

461
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,496
<i>It was a Special Ed. class,</i>
<i>and I just...</i>

462
00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:00,997
Oh.

463
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:03,500
I just felt at home.

464
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:04,601
Time.
Heart rate's normal.

465
00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:05,869
You can get out now.

466
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,974
It's not cold agglutinins.

467
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,277
I'm not surprised.

468
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:16,079
She obviously has brain damage.

469
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:19,749
Seriously.

470
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,029
She screwed up a room number
six years ago,

471
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:25,730
and you decide
she has brain damage?

472
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:28,633
Transposed digits--

473
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:31,136
classic marker
for number confusion.

474
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:34,039
Means she has a lesion in her
left parahippocampal region.

475
00:20:34,106 --> 00:20:35,440
This morning.

476
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:36,708
Must be contagious.

477
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:39,578
She also forgot to pee
before your fake test.

478
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:40,779
So she has a small bladder.

479
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:43,048
Shows an inability
to predict the future.

480
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:44,282
Also located in the left hemisphere

481
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,483
<i>of the brain,</i>

482
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:47,018
Close to the parahippocampal region.

483
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:48,987
Means the damage is ongoing.

484
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:50,155
Two subtle clues six years apart--

485
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:51,323
that's hardly compelling evidence.

486
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,024
I'm compelled.
- That's not what this is.

487
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:54,859
Every time a decent person

488
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:57,529
<i>comes in, you set out to prove</i>
<i>that they have brain damage.</i>

489
00:20:57,597 --> 00:20:59,965
I never said her deranged
personality was a symptom.

490
00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:01,833
You don't need to.
I've been here five years.

491
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:03,535
I can hear your thoughts
from my apartment.

492
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:06,605
Can you hear me now?

493
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:10,208
Move on to another organ.

494
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:11,876
I did.

495
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:14,012
The screwed up numbers
and forgetting to pee

496
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,680
points to her
being a human being.

497
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:17,349
The platelet dysfunction
and cardiac arrest

498
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,416
points to a pancreatic tumor.

499
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:21,920
Or multiple sclerosis.

500
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:24,356
The brain is like the internet--

501
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:26,891
<i>Packets of information</i>
<i>constantly flowing</i>

502
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,827
from one area to another.

503
00:21:28,894 --> 00:21:31,663
Plaques in her brain
are like a bad server,

504
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:33,031
<i>slow down the flow.</i>

505
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,532
If it's in the parahippocampus,

506
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,301
it'll spread to the brain stem,

507
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,636
which means it'll be the lungs next.

508
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:39,738
Brain biopsy

509
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:41,740
will show you the plaques.

510
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:43,475
Or we could not cut
into her brain.

511
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:44,976
<i>It's just her pancreas.</i>

512
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:46,945
We should do an ERCP.

513
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:49,914
Well, we could settle this
with rock, paper, scissors,

514
00:21:49,982 --> 00:21:51,149
<i>but...</i>

515
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:53,318
unfortunately, there are people

516
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:55,387
who adjudicate these disputes.

517
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:57,022
A pancreatic tumor
is much more likely to kill her.

518
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:59,357
Not this week, not next week,
not next month.

519
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:01,393
The number confusion was six years ago.

520
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,496
You don't think we have time for an ERCP?
- The heart attack was six hours ago.

521
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:06,798
Now, maybe it's planning to go
into hiding for a couple years,

522
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:08,133
or maybe it's gonna hit her lungs.

523
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,268
Stop!

524
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:12,170
We have to assume it's the brain.

525
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:15,774
I'll go fire up the biopsy drill.

526
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:17,909
No, we had to assume it's the brain

527
00:22:17,977 --> 00:22:19,377
until we prove otherwise.

528
00:22:19,445 --> 00:22:20,945
Do an MRI, T-2 images.

529
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,617
You want me to do another test?

530
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,452
You should be able to see
the M.S. plaques.

531
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,754
If they exist,
you can do your biopsy.

532
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:32,691
No.

533
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:37,896
You want to say yes.

534
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:39,464
You know you should say yes,

535
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:42,100
but you also think that this job
is about standing up to me.

536
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:43,601
<i>So you're not gonna say yes.</i>

537
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:46,805
You're not gonna say no.
You're just gonna waste time.

538
00:22:46,872 --> 00:22:48,773
And the patient's brain,
or pancreas,

539
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:50,508
<i>or whatever is wrong with her</i>
<i>is not gonna wait</i>

540
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:51,643
<i>for you to impress your boss.</i>

541
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:53,545
So pick one--
either him or me.

542
00:22:53,612 --> 00:22:57,248
Do the MRI.

543
00:23:10,062 --> 00:23:12,230
You're still here?

544
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:15,333
The whole point of giving Cameron the job

545
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:16,634
was so that you could--
- I don't want to go home.

546
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:27,345
House told me
I should give her back.

547
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:31,149
Instead of being offended,

548
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:33,551
I've been wondering if he's right.

549
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:34,986
He's not.

550
00:23:35,054 --> 00:23:36,921
He never is,

551
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:40,258
not when it's
anything personal, or human,

552
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:42,727
or...
- No, he's always cold.

553
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:46,264
He's always an ass,
but he's very rarely just wrong.

554
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:48,600
I've read

555
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:52,237
every bonding
and attachment book there is.

556
00:23:52,304 --> 00:23:54,272
I feel like I'm in prison at home.

557
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,040
I feel like I'm free here.

558
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:59,544
Parents make sacrifices.

559
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:02,080
I don't know if I want to.

560
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,151
I'm not proud of this.

561
00:24:06,218 --> 00:24:08,219
I feel terrible.

562
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:11,356
I feel like a failure.

563
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:19,764
But she deserves to be loved.

564
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:22,934
I-I...

565
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:24,569
I don't know what to say.

566
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:32,010
<i>No plaques on the
left hemisphere.</i>

567
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:33,745
Or the right.

568
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:38,082
Even magnified images of her
hippocampal region, nothing.

569
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,219
This is surprising.

570
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:44,422
So can we cancel the biopsy?

571
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,624
Go ahead with the ERCP.

572
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,265
I need to talk to you about Remy.

573
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,567
Who?

574
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:56,968
Thirteen.

575
00:24:57,036 --> 00:24:58,102
What did you call her?

576
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,204
She's on placebo.

577
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,308
And you want to change that.

578
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:07,145
I'm the last person you'd ever
come to for ethical advice,

579
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:08,947
literally,

580
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:11,950
which means you've already asked
every other person,

581
00:25:12,017 --> 00:25:14,085
and no one's given you
the answer you want.

582
00:25:14,153 --> 00:25:15,520
Or I respect your opinion,

583
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:17,188
and I want to hear
what comes to your mind.

584
00:25:17,256 --> 00:25:19,724
Has she invited
any of her lesbian friends

585
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:20,792
into bed with you?

586
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,627
I was mistaken.

587
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:24,329
Drug gonna cure her?

588
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:29,267
It looks promising, reducing symptoms.

589
00:25:29,335 --> 00:25:30,602
No cure then.

590
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:32,971
So the pros are:

591
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:34,873
You might delay the onset of symptoms,

592
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,774
Give her an extra year,
maybe three.

593
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:39,377
She's still dead before you're 45.

594
00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:41,346
The question is, are those few years

595
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:43,615
worth risking the rest
of your life in medicine?

596
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:48,953
No.

597
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:51,055
There, that wasn't so hard, was it?

598
00:25:51,123 --> 00:25:53,958
Thank you.

599
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:56,227
You're welcome.

600
00:25:58,063 --> 00:26:02,433
Unless you love her.

601
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,238
If you love her,

602
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:11,009
you do stupid things.

603
00:26:17,016 --> 00:26:18,816
Common bile duct
is clear.

604
00:26:18,884 --> 00:26:21,486
No filling defects in the biliary tree.

605
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:22,954
Oh, God.
- What?

606
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:24,756
It's her lungs.
House was right.

607
00:26:24,823 --> 00:26:26,257
O-2 SAT's down to 89.

608
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:28,059
Increase to 100% O-2.

609
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:28,993
Better get out.

610
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:36,935
Do we have to tell him?

611
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:45,550
The surgeons were able to
drain the pleural effusions.

612
00:26:45,618 --> 00:26:47,151
The patient's breathing on her own,

613
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:48,620
But she's still pretty weak.

614
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:51,689
Lung failure proves
that one of us was right.

615
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:53,024
Who said brain?

616
00:26:53,092 --> 00:26:54,893
Yes, you predicted
that her lungs would fail,

617
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,895
but the MRI was negative for M.S.

618
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:59,597
I was right about the where,
but not the what.

619
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:04,736
A picornavirus could cause
localized demyelination

620
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:06,604
that the MRI wouldn't pick up.

621
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:08,573
If we run a nerve-conduction study

622
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,208
on the surface of her brain,

623
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:12,210
we'll see the dead spots.

624
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:14,178
Are you talking
about cutting into her skull?

625
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:17,081
Actually, I'm talking
about cutting off her skull,

626
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:18,550
exposing her brain.

627
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:20,518
A pancreatic tumor could still fit.

628
00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:22,253
It explains the heart,
the blood, and her lungs.

629
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:23,621
ERCP was negative.

630
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:25,657
And she agrees with me

631
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:28,560
because she agrees with me,
right, sweetie?

632
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:29,861
All we need is a more sensitive test.

633
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:31,462
Endoscopic ultrasound.

634
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,832
Just accept that
you've been proven wrong.

635
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,803
You were also proven wrong.
Why don't I get a second test?

636
00:27:38,871 --> 00:27:40,672
Because if I'm right
about the brain,

637
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:42,807
then we don't have time
to indulge your wrongness.

638
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,843
Let me know
when Cameron says yes

639
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:47,745
to cutting off our patient's skull.

640
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:49,781
I'll be doing the endoscopic ultrasound.

641
00:27:52,117 --> 00:27:53,985
<i>Good news.</i>

642
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:55,653
I don't need your approval

643
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,989
for some crazy, unproven treatment.

644
00:27:58,057 --> 00:27:59,524
I just need to do a test.

645
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:01,326
You want to remove
your patient's skull.

646
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:04,963
Remind me to revoke
Kutner's telephone privileges.

647
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,331
I didn't realize

648
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:07,966
that was an A.M.A.-approved
treatment for M.S.

649
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:10,435
Not searching for M.S.,
but what set it off--

650
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:12,337
Equine encephalitis.

651
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:15,873
Turned a cool breeze of M.S.
into a CAT-5 storm.

652
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:17,508
I didn't realize
your patient was a horse.

653
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:19,677
There's been human cases.

654
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:20,878
Not when it's 30 degrees outside.

655
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:21,980
Transmission is by mosquito.

656
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:24,949
So she got bitten six months ago,

657
00:28:25,017 --> 00:28:26,317
or it's some other infection.

658
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:27,819
Whatever it is,

659
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:29,387
it's running rampant
in the left side of her brain.

660
00:28:29,455 --> 00:28:31,055
When I get in there,
I'll get you the specifics.

661
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:34,859
You're asking me to let you cut
off the top of someone's head.

662
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:37,662
I need more than,
"I'll know it when I see it."

663
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,564
So you want proof before you let
me go looking for the proof?

664
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:40,765
This is the test.

665
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,500
You have to give me something.

666
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,438
Cuddy's gonna love you.

667
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:50,475
The patient, on the other hand,

668
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:53,544
is gonna hate you until the day
she dies next week.

669
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:57,215
Actually, this idiot
will probably forgive you.

670
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:06,691
<i>It looks like something</i>
<i>you could hang something off.</i>

671
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,892
You gonna help or what?

672
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,662
<i>I want kids.</i>

673
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:12,163
Um...

674
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:14,032
I think these kids
are already spoken for.

675
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:16,334
Not now.

676
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:19,604
But since we're dating,
I just thought you should know.

677
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:20,672
But I thought,

678
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:21,973
because of your illness--

679
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,808
So did I.

680
00:29:23,876 --> 00:29:26,778
Even when I didn't know
if I had it or not,

681
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:28,613
I just assumed
I couldn't take the chance,

682
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:31,082
but now...

683
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,153
Even though I know I have it,
it feels like...

684
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,754
an option.

685
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:49,467
You really don't have
to keep buying me things.

686
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:51,803
Just open it.

687
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:57,241
This is nice.

688
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:02,480
The picture is actually your gift.

689
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:07,185
That's your baby.

690
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:08,786
<i>I took her picture</i>
<i>to one of those places</i>

691
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:10,621
<i>that does</i>
<i>that age-enhancement thing.</i>

692
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:12,790
And according to the kid
who works there,

693
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:14,225
this is a pretty good approximation

694
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:17,395
of what your daughter will look
like 18 years from now.

695
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:20,064
That's, uh, sort of cool.

696
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:22,967
Right now she's just
this weird little creature

697
00:30:23,035 --> 00:30:26,037
that sleeps, and poops, and cries.

698
00:30:26,105 --> 00:30:28,439
But that...

699
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:30,608
is who she's gonna be.

700
00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:33,444
You will be teaching her
how to ride a bike,

701
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:36,781
<i>giving her advice</i>
<i>about friends and school</i>

702
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:38,382
<i>and having her heart broken.</i>

703
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,419
She'll ignore most of it,
but some of it'll stick.

704
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:44,922
<i>You're gonna be there for her</i>
<i>through all of that.</i>

705
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,291
You just have to get
through this part.

706
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,227
That's all.

707
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:53,931
It's very sweet.

708
00:30:59,438 --> 00:31:02,673
I'll pay you back for the photo.

709
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:04,275
Don't worry about it.

710
00:31:04,343 --> 00:31:05,810
It's just the picture
that came with the frame.

711
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:06,811
You can chuck it.

712
00:31:18,032 --> 00:31:21,935
Kid with a raging viral syndrome

713
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:25,738
And three dead mosquitoes.

714
00:31:25,806 --> 00:31:28,374
I'm off to storm the bastille.

715
00:31:28,442 --> 00:31:29,909
These aren't mosquitoes.

716
00:31:29,977 --> 00:31:33,046
Fruit flies--
close enough.

717
00:31:33,114 --> 00:31:34,747
Acute viral nasopharyngitis?

718
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:37,884
One of her students
has the common cold?

719
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:39,886
Team's not what it used to be.

720
00:31:39,954 --> 00:31:42,155
<i>On the other hand,</i>

721
00:31:42,223 --> 00:31:43,490
Kutner ran his endoscopic ultrasound.

722
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:44,958
Didn't find peep.

723
00:31:45,025 --> 00:31:46,860
So disproving it's her pancreas
proves it's her brain?

724
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:48,061
Yes.

725
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:50,964
You used to do this job,
remember?

726
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:52,432
That's what used to pass
for evidence.

727
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,766
Now I do <i>this</i> job.

728
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,902
You brought me three dead bugs
and a runny nose.

729
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:56,970
I can't find you the proof you want

730
00:31:57,037 --> 00:31:58,104
Because it's trapped inside her head.

731
00:31:58,172 --> 00:31:59,472
<i>And the only way I can get at it</i>

732
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,940
<i>Is to cut it open</i>
<i>and rip it out,</i>

733
00:32:01,008 --> 00:32:02,809
Which is apparently the one test
you won't let me run.

734
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,344
So either I do this,
or I do nothing.

735
00:32:04,411 --> 00:32:06,779
What do you want me to do?

736
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:10,650
Say yes just because you're House?

737
00:32:10,718 --> 00:32:12,819
I'd certainly like that, yeah.

738
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,827
Yes.

739
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,041
Cameron actually said yes?

740
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:37,510
Nope, I'm just obsessive
about clean cuticles.

741
00:32:37,578 --> 00:32:39,279
Sawing off the top of her skull

742
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:41,281
and placing electrodes
on her brain is insane.

743
00:32:41,348 --> 00:32:43,650
Right, we should be retesting
her pancreas

744
00:32:43,717 --> 00:32:45,118
for the umpteenth time.

745
00:32:45,186 --> 00:32:46,853
You're skipping steps
because it's Cameron.

746
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:48,588
You haven't figured her out yet,

747
00:32:48,656 --> 00:32:50,123
And you want to see how far you can push.
- I'm skipping steps

748
00:32:50,191 --> 00:32:52,859
because our patient is skipping
steps on the way to being dead.

749
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:54,160
If you've got
a better idea...

750
00:32:54,228 --> 00:32:55,495
We should remove
her spleen.

751
00:32:55,563 --> 00:32:57,764
Splenic lymphoma
explains the damaged platelets,

752
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:58,898
the heart, the lungs.

753
00:33:01,202 --> 00:33:03,102
If this doesn't work,
the spleen's all yours.

754
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:08,074
Unless I kill her, of course.

755
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:09,742
<i> Not only will this allow us</i>

756
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,145
<i>to clock your brain's</i>
<i>processing speed,</i>

757
00:33:12,213 --> 00:33:15,481
You'll also get free cable
for the first three months.

758
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,850
What's this?

759
00:33:17,918 --> 00:33:19,252
A blue car.

760
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,454
Is that part of the test?

761
00:33:21,522 --> 00:33:23,890
Nope, my lease is up next month.
You like?

762
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,493
I'm gonna ask you a series
of questions

763
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:29,662
designed to stimulate
left-brain function--

764
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,599
<i>logic, reasoning,</i>
<i>problem-solving.</i>

765
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:35,235
Or as my mentor, Old Ben,
liked to call it,

766
00:33:35,302 --> 00:33:36,436
"the dark side."

767
00:33:36,503 --> 00:33:38,404
<i>If we find slow areas,</i>

768
00:33:38,472 --> 00:33:40,006
we know we found damage.

769
00:33:40,074 --> 00:33:41,140
We treat.
You go home.

770
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,275
<i>Ready?</i>

771
00:33:42,343 --> 00:33:44,677
I'd nod yes,
but I can't move my head.

772
00:33:44,745 --> 00:33:47,447
This pen is red.

773
00:33:47,514 --> 00:33:48,848
Its ink is red.

774
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:50,950
Is all ink red?

775
00:33:51,018 --> 00:33:52,919
No.

776
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:54,153
Nerve conduction's
12.8 meters per second--

777
00:33:54,221 --> 00:33:55,655
right within range.

778
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:57,790
Cameron's letting him cut
into our patient's skull

779
00:33:57,858 --> 00:34:00,493
based on nothing but dead bugs
and someone else's runny nose.

780
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:03,463
There are two pints in a quart,
four quarts in a gallon.

781
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,698
<i>How many pints</i>
<i>in five gallons?</i>

782
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:08,067
<i>House, step away</i>

783
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:09,769
<i>from the patient.</i>

784
00:34:09,837 --> 00:34:10,803
Who's that?

785
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,707
<i> Okay, all right.</i>

786
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:17,410
That's my old boss.

787
00:34:17,478 --> 00:34:19,379
And by "old,"
I don't mean "former."

788
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:21,714
Insulting me
is not gonna make me go away.

789
00:34:21,782 --> 00:34:23,283
You're not here.

790
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,617
<i>Obviously I'm not trying</i>
<i>to make you go away.</i>

791
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:27,487
Hint--
the answer is a number.

792
00:34:27,554 --> 00:34:31,124
Um, 40?

793
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:33,893
12.4 meters per second--
conduction is still normal.

794
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:36,896
Dr. Cameron, you're actually
assisting him with this?

795
00:34:36,964 --> 00:34:39,532
Yes, because I'm actually
familiar with this case.

796
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,134
Well, I'm familiar enough to know

797
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:43,536
that cutting into this woman's
brain is not necessary.

798
00:34:43,604 --> 00:34:44,904
Is she serious?

799
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:46,406
Well, she's certainly not funny.

800
00:34:46,473 --> 00:34:48,474
Put the phone down.

801
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:50,543
Pick up the baby.
Make us all happy.

802
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:53,646
Okay, settle down, baby.
It's okay.

803
00:34:53,714 --> 00:34:55,348
We'll be done in a minute.

804
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:57,050
<i>House,</i>
<i>I can call security.</i>

805
00:34:57,117 --> 00:34:58,451
<i>I can--</i>
- BP's dropping.

806
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,186
<i>Get it back up.</i>

807
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:01,220
I got a whole stack
of these.

808
00:35:01,288 --> 00:35:02,789
Give her ten CCs dopamine.

809
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:04,057
Already am, thanks.

810
00:35:04,124 --> 00:35:06,125
Your baby needs you
a lot more than we do.

811
00:35:06,193 --> 00:35:07,660
<i> You aren't hungry,</i>
<i>and you aren't wet.</i>

812
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:09,095
I don't know what it is.

813
00:35:09,163 --> 00:35:12,699
Oh, that is so annoying.
Can you make it stop?

814
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:15,268
The baby's crying is annoying you?

815
00:35:15,336 --> 00:35:17,503
What's her nerve conduction?

816
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:19,339
14.3--
it's actually speeding up.

817
00:35:19,406 --> 00:35:21,808
But her BP's 80 over palp.
We're gonna have to stop.

818
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:22,942
Ugh.

819
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,510
That doesn't make any sense.

820
00:35:24,578 --> 00:35:27,280
The fact that you're wrong
doesn't make any sense,

821
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:28,681
<i>or the fact that I believed</i>
<i>that you were right?</i>

822
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:29,682
<i>BP's still dropping.</i>
<i>She's gonna stroke.</i>

823
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:33,086
I'm giving her ten more CCs,

824
00:35:33,153 --> 00:35:34,754
And I'm putting an end to this.

825
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,592
Okay, Rachel, quiet down!

826
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,594
I need you to be quiet!

827
00:35:41,662 --> 00:35:44,197
Please, turn that phone off!

828
00:35:44,264 --> 00:35:46,566
Why does the baby annoy you,
but no one else does?

829
00:35:48,202 --> 00:35:49,769
I mean, you're right
about her, but--

830
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:51,471
I don't know what you want!

831
00:35:51,538 --> 00:35:53,506
I will give you anything
that you want!

832
00:35:53,574 --> 00:35:56,976
I don't know what it is!

833
00:35:57,044 --> 00:35:59,879
Tell me!
Please, just help me!

834
00:35:59,947 --> 00:36:01,381
Please!

835
00:36:06,887 --> 00:36:08,755
Really?

836
00:36:11,158 --> 00:36:12,191
That worked?

837
00:36:15,229 --> 00:36:17,663
<i>She's stable.</i>

838
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:19,699
We're finished here.

839
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:23,069
<i>Close her up.</i>

840
00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:36,132
How long until we can perform
the splenectomy?

841
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,733
Can't dose her with anesthesia

842
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:39,769
till the last batch completely clears.

843
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:41,937
How come the baby annoyed her?

844
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:43,272
We should get her in there
as soon as we can.

845
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:44,540
Two hours at least.

846
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:46,509
Her blood pressure's
in the tank.

847
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:49,312
I hope she lasts two hours.

848
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:51,714
What was different?

849
00:36:51,782 --> 00:36:54,984
Our patient
loves all things annoying.

850
00:36:55,052 --> 00:36:57,453
She'd love this conversation.

851
00:36:57,521 --> 00:36:59,722
She's an earth mother,

852
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,358
takes in the freaks and rejects
of humanity

853
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:03,793
And tells them they're a-okay.

854
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,127
So what was different?

855
00:37:05,195 --> 00:37:07,363
Her head was open,

856
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:09,165
you were asking her questions,

857
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:11,033
A baby was crying.

858
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:14,670
She had low blood pressure.

859
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:17,273
According to the laws of physics,

860
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:19,542
low blood pressure
causes light-headedness,

861
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:20,976
chest pain,

862
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:23,479
but not annoyance.

863
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,564
Move your feet.

864
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:43,933
You decided to keep her.

865
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,868
Thank you for telling me.
You can go now.

866
00:37:48,772 --> 00:37:49,705
Mmm.

867
00:37:49,773 --> 00:37:52,641
I talked to her.

868
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:53,843
We connected.

869
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,412
You talked at her.

870
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,347
You had a chemical reaction.

871
00:37:58,415 --> 00:38:00,449
You trying to annoy me?

872
00:38:00,517 --> 00:38:02,118
I'm trying to explain you.

873
00:38:02,185 --> 00:38:03,886
I know it doesn't make
any sense,

874
00:38:03,954 --> 00:38:06,188
but it was real.

875
00:38:06,256 --> 00:38:08,090
<i>It was there.</i>

876
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:09,859
You want to hold her?

877
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:11,527
Come up here.

878
00:38:11,595 --> 00:38:12,995
Come say hi.

879
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:15,030
You think we'll bond?

880
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,910
Is that cute?

881
00:38:27,978 --> 00:38:29,612
A little.

882
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,515
If I threw up on you,
you'd be pissed.

883
00:38:32,582 --> 00:38:35,818
Your puke isn't as cute.

884
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:37,153
That's 'cause of your hips.

885
00:38:38,855 --> 00:38:40,556
If she would've just gestated
a little longer,

886
00:38:40,624 --> 00:38:42,858
her stomach sphincter
would be fully mature.

887
00:38:42,926 --> 00:38:43,993
But, no,

888
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,428
we have to walk upright,

889
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:48,998
which means that baby's head
is too big for mommy's hips.

890
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:51,801
And by the way, your hips may be
an evolutionary improvement.

891
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:55,604
So we've evolved
to find baby puke cute,

892
00:38:55,672 --> 00:38:57,406
<i>'cause otherwise</i>
<i>we'd kill them all</i>

893
00:38:57,474 --> 00:38:59,141
before they became functional.

894
00:39:05,649 --> 00:39:08,451
Bonding's over.

895
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:09,819
I got to go see another baby.

896
00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:17,359
So I can just live spleen-free?

897
00:39:17,427 --> 00:39:19,862
Plenty of people live
perfectly normal lives without--

898
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,430
<i>Spleen's fine.</i>

899
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:23,132
It's not her brain.

900
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,633
Of course it's her brain.

901
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:26,735
You looked at her brain.
You took off her skull.

902
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:28,037
You found nothing.

903
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:30,005
Didn't look in the right part.

904
00:39:30,073 --> 00:39:32,908
Didn't look in the heart part.

905
00:39:35,045 --> 00:39:36,278
In the womb,

906
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:39,148
Blood has to bypass the lungs,

907
00:39:39,216 --> 00:39:40,649
Since they don't work yet.

908
00:39:40,717 --> 00:39:43,786
When we're born,
we take our first big breath,

909
00:39:43,854 --> 00:39:47,289
lungs expand, and the ductus closes.

910
00:39:47,357 --> 00:39:49,925
Yours didn't.

911
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:54,330
She has a patent ductus arteriosis.

912
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:55,331
When you get stressed,

913
00:39:55,398 --> 00:39:57,533
your blood pressure goes up

914
00:39:57,601 --> 00:40:00,503
and forces open the ductus.

915
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,171
Blood takes a little detour,

916
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,108
makes it leak from your nose,
your stomach, your lungs,

917
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:08,310
and, more significantly,
keeps it flowing

918
00:40:08,378 --> 00:40:12,047
to the right side of your brain
and away from your left.

919
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:16,385
Which means that when you get
stressed, you get unstressed.

920
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:19,655
That's why you're so good
with those annoying kids.

921
00:40:19,723 --> 00:40:22,725
And why, when your
blood pressure dropped,

922
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:26,128
you were able to identify Cuddy
as an annoying human being.

923
00:40:28,098 --> 00:40:29,231
<i>Good news is,</i>

924
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:32,101
we can fix the heart.

925
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:35,337
Bad news for the annoying kids.

926
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:43,012
<i>She's incredible.</i>

927
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,647
Thank you.

928
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:47,816
Great work today.

929
00:40:47,884 --> 00:40:50,019
I should've trusted your instincts.

930
00:40:50,086 --> 00:40:53,889
I will in the future.

931
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:57,259
I quit.

932
00:40:57,327 --> 00:40:59,261
I think I just apologized.

933
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:01,297
If you want,
I can get down on my knees.

934
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:02,431
It's not because of you.

935
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:05,601
I approved an insane procedure

936
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:08,370
with no proof, no evidence, no--

937
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:10,706
You made the right call.

938
00:41:10,774 --> 00:41:13,042
The problem
was a brain problem.

939
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:15,044
Without the procedure,
House never notices

940
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:17,079
the increased left-brain function.

941
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:19,648
She'd be dead if you hadn't said yes.
- I know.

942
00:41:19,716 --> 00:41:21,517
But...

943
00:41:23,954 --> 00:41:26,255
I'll always say yes to House.

944
00:41:26,323 --> 00:41:29,058
<i>I studied under him.</i>
<i>He's in my head.</i>

945
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:32,061
And if you gave anyone else this
job, they would always say no,

946
00:41:32,128 --> 00:41:35,097
<i>because--</i>
<i>well, because they should.</i>

947
00:41:35,165 --> 00:41:36,999
House is insane.

948
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:41,637
Which leaves me.

949
00:41:43,873 --> 00:41:45,174
I'm sorry.

950
00:41:47,911 --> 00:41:52,615
# how can it be #

951
00:41:52,682 --> 00:41:55,417
Hey, buddy!
# we are losing ourselves? #

952
00:41:55,485 --> 00:41:57,086
<i>Oh!</i>

953
00:41:57,153 --> 00:41:58,721
It's okay, buddy.
Come here.

954
00:41:58,788 --> 00:42:00,990
Oh, I missed you so much.

955
00:42:01,057 --> 00:42:03,025
I missed you.

956
00:42:03,093 --> 00:42:08,964
# underneath my own hell
when the daylight comes down #

957
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:15,437
# oh, we are dying away #

958
00:42:15,505 --> 00:42:17,339
# all I can say #

959
00:42:17,407 --> 00:42:19,208
# when the band begins to play #

960
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:20,342
# there's no angel #

961
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,645
# on my side #

962
00:42:22,712 --> 00:42:25,047
# and I will need you #

963
00:42:25,115 --> 00:42:26,982
# on my side #

964
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:30,619
# #

965
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:31,854
# can you hear #

966
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:35,891
# them calling me? #

967
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:39,294
# #

968
00:42:39,362 --> 00:42:41,563
# and the rusted dawn #

969
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:47,703
# of a thousand years #

970
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:51,874
# goes by #

971
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:56,879
# aah #

972
00:42:56,946 --> 00:43:00,783
# all I can say
when the band begins to play #

973
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,353
# there's no angel on my side #
