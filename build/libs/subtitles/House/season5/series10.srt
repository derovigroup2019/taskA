1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:05,030
Do you want a lean body
for summer? Well,
the time to start is now.

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:08,871
No gimmicks, no crash diets,
and absolutely no drugs.

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,773
Think healthy,
and be healthy.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,072
You can start now,

5
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:15,444
just pick up the phone
and become the best you
you can be.

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,945
Cut! Going again.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,713
Sorry. Did I mess up
the commercial?

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,276
No, it's fine.
Are you okay?

9
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,084
I think it's cramps.
Oh! I'm burning on my side.

10
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,591
Sit down, take a few minutes
and catch your breath.

11
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:27,819
Everybody else,
keep running.

12
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:28,918
We're not filming.

13
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,520
We don't do this
for the cameras,
we do it for ourselves.

14
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,122
We can't go again
with him sitting there.

15
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,794
Fine. But that felt phony.
At least let me get
a little workout,

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,931
maybe if I'm breathing as hard
as they are I won't seem like
such an evil taskmaster.

17
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,770
All right, take five, guys.

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,106
How you feeling?

19
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,407
I think I'm ready to do this.

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,881
You sure? That's it.
That's the way to
fight through.

21
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,478
All right, concentrate
on those knees,
lean into it and lift.

22
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,285
Lifting. Lifting. Lifting.
Come on, push it!

23
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,326
Come on, you're
almost at the top.

24
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,624
Those eight steps
are the difference
between fat and thin.

25
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:09,328
Seven, six, five,
four, one more.
Nice job!

26
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:11,800
Feel that burn?

27
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,805
That's your body
carving out its new shape.

28
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:14,897
New shape.

29
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:18,000
Don't sit, just take it
slow on the way down.

30
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,409
Oh, boy.

31
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,581
Are you okay?

32
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,253
You okay?

33
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,861
Any idea why we're getting
half as many requests
for you as usual?

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,532
Democrats'
health care plan?

35
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,203
At least we have one case
that looks intriguing.

36
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,644
30-year-old fitness trainer
suddenly can't breathe,

37
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,875
collapses and
breaks her ankle.

38
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,407
That's it? You're not
gonna argue why this
case is beneath you?

39
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,182
No point,
I'm in an elevator.
I can't run away.

40
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,087
You can't run away anyway.

41
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,625
That's just mean.

42
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,026
Why are we
still together?

43
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,331
We are going to
our office.

44
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:54,567
Pronoun confusion,
starts kicking in once you
pass the childbearing age.

45
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,372
Now that's just mean.
My office was
recently destroyed.

46
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,277
I thought I'd use
the office of the doctor
directly responsible.

47
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,871
I think the patient
holding the gun to my head

48
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,610
was actually the one
directly responsible.

49
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,279
My desk won't fit in his cell.
You can use our outer office.

50
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,092
Where's Foreman
and Thirteen?

51
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,635
Down in the GRC.

52
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,330
Thirteen started her
clinical trials today.

53
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,895
What's Cuddy doing
in your office?

54
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,702
Other than throwing off
the feng shui

55
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,176
with her ass that faces
all eight sides of
the Bagua at once?

56
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,906
These walls
aren't soundproof.

57
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,140
I'm well aware.

58
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,274
Normal CT means
that her lung problem

59
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,648
has the distinction of having
nothing to do with her lungs.

60
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,745
Steroids. No one looks
this fit without cheating.

61
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,017
Anabolic steroids
hack away at the
immune system,

62
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,491
left her open to
a pulmonary infection.

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,656
Wow. Muscles and curves.
My penis is so confused.

64
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,823
She's not on steroids.

65
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,060
Her program's all about
getting in shape naturally,

66
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,567
exercising, eating right.

67
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,103
And you know
this because?

68
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,833
She has infomercials
to sell her DVDs.

69
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,101
What? I'm up late a lot.

70
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,406
And you actually believe
what you see on TV?
Go run the labs.

71
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,345
The labs are back
and there's no sign
of steroid use.

72
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,575
Can someone please
read her file?

73
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,414
Can someone please
stop back seat
differential-ating?

74
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,679
What about allergies?

75
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,985
She goes jogging every
morning, inhales car
fumes during rush hour.

76
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:21,993
Perfect, except that she
was jogging half a mile
from the nearest road.

77
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,088
In the cold.

78
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:29,624
Cold air hits the lungs,
sets off an attack,
exercise-induced asthma.

79
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:33,194
Nice try, except EIA doesn't
account for the elevated BP.

80
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,366
If you'd read the file...

81
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,899
Come on,
before the shrieking
harpy melts my brain.

82
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,345
Her BP's fine.
I know.

83
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,385
Exercise-induced
asthma actually fits.

84
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,283
I know. You know.
She can't know.

85
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,981
The only good way
to test for EIA

86
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,149
is to recreate the conditions
in which the attack occurred.

87
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,820
But we can't exactly make her
run out in the cold
on a broken ankle.

88
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,089
Get creative.

89
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,761
It's gonna be okay.

90
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,004
Any shortness of breath?
Tightness in your chest?

91
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,337
Feeling pretty
good, actually.

92
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,433
Not even
breathing hard.

93
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,740
O2 sats and lung capacity
are still well within range.

94
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,440
Cuff's slipping down,
you wanna stop for a moment?

95
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,074
Rather not.
Haven't had any
exercise in two days.

96
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,243
Take it you don't get
a lot of fat in your diet.

97
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,549
I take it from your tone
you think that's a bad thing.

98
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,781
Do you ever indulge?

99
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,416
There's more to life
than indulging your
every whim.

100
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,292
I didn't say "every."
But a whim every now and
then can make life a little...

101
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,024
You okay?
Trouble breathing?

102
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,861
No, I feel fine. Why?

103
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,200
No pulse.
This isn't asthma.

104
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,581
There are a lot of
other people in the trial?

105
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,516
I'm taking over the people
that already started it at
Mercy, so I'm pretty full.

106
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,647
Stop.

107
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,216
One more time.
No talking.

108
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,331
I shouldn't be here.
It's nepotism.

109
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,300
I know the guy running the
drug trial, so I get a spot.

110
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:46,498
You have Huntington's,
so you get a spot. Stop.

111
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,004
One more time.
Just the fingers,
no mouth.

112
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,846
The point of this thing
is to improve neural
cell longevity,

113
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,315
which doesn't matter much
before symptoms,

114
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,476
so you should give
my spot to someone...

115
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,849
Shut up.

116
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,987
Stop.

117
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,223
You can stop
feeling guilty.

118
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,656
Your best tapping
rate was.004 taps
per millisecond.

119
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,497
Means your nerves
have started degenerating.

120
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:37,485
You want to work in here?
Fine. Me, too.

121
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:42,494
We'll split the desk 50-50.
That side's yours,
this side's mine.

122
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,688
You're right.

123
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,228
There's plenty of space here,
neither one of us
needs all of it.

124
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,464
That's your strategy?
Taking the high road?
It's not going to work.

125
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,867
Huh? Did you say something?

126
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,501
I couldn't hear you from
all the way over here
on my side of the desk.

127
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,942
Patient's
heart stopped.

128
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,411
We shocked her
back to sinus rhythm,
she's stable.

129
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,915
Test didn't set it off,
her EKG was normal.

130
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,352
Well, she's consistent.

131
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,912
Lung problems
have nothing to do
with her lungs,

132
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,220
heart problem
that has nothing to do
with her heart.

133
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,192
Something is
strangling her system.

134
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,285
Carcinoid tumor.

135
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,064
Find it, cut it out.

136
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,536
Can a leaking breast
implant cause joint pain?

137
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:38,050
No, and she clearly doesn't
have implants. Or joint pain.
What's going on?

138
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,550
Got another patient.

139
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,884
I set up an online
second opinion clinic.

140
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,822
People who don't like
or trust their doctors
e-mail symptoms,

141
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:50,795
I can knock off four or five
cases over lunch, clear two
grand by e-mailing them back.

142
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,455
Ascending colon's clean.

143
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,692
That's gotta be illegal.

144
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,291
Only in nine states,
and this isn't one of them.

145
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,270
Legal notice spells out
it doesn't replace
doctor's visits,

146
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,238
so there's no opportunity
for malpractice.

147
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,399
How come
you haven't said
anything about this?

148
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,943
It's no big secret.
I guess I'm just
not very chatty.

149
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,208
You told us when you
renewed your subscription
to <i>National Geographic.</i>

150
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,079
Small intestine looks clean,
moving into the pylorus.

151
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,380
So you don't mind
if I tell House?

152
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:18,389
Actually, House may
sort of mind. Because I sort
of set it up in House's name.

153
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,953
Nothing in the bile duct.

154
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,860
And by "set it up in
his name," you mean?

155
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,796
I mean, it's
Dr. Gregory House's
Second Opinion Clinic

156
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,495
with medical advice
direct from Dr. Gregory House.

157
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,767
You're insane.
With two days to live.

158
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,067
House's never
gonna find out.

159
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,574
He will if I tell him.

160
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,441
Or you cut me in for 30%,
and I keep your secret safe.

161
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,776
That's blackmail.

162
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:43,872
Yes.

163
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,877
Moving into the... Whoa.

164
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,256
That's her stomach?
It's the size of
a shot glass.

165
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,693
Because our patient's
a big, fat cheater.

166
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,731
Subtle. No way you
geniuses could have
spotted this.

167
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,798
Gastric bypass surgery,
she had her stomach stapled,

168
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:14,244
then had the records from
her files pulled so it
wouldn't ruin her DVD sales.

169
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,304
Can you do this outside?

170
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,613
I could. But that would defeat
the purpose of doing it here.

171
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,951
Where are the smart guys?

172
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,511
If you mean
Foreman and Thirteen,

173
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,854
apparently the first
appointment of the drug
trial is an all-day thing.

174
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,188
I said yes to this?

175
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,750
Her gastric bypass
procedure could cause...

176
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,263
Forget the bypass,
treat her like a fat girl.

177
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,266
Should we treat her like
a 60-year-old Asian man, too?

178
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,426
She's not fat.

179
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:40,768
Not on the outside,
but on the inside
she's still tons of fun.

180
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,905
When she was obese,
she probably had
Type 2 diabetes,

181
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,604
could have left her
with permanent nerve damage.

182
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,412
Ten points for doing
what I said, minus ten
points for doing it badly.

183
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,181
If this was diabetes-induced
nerve damage, it would've
kicked in years ago.

184
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,619
Have you seen my balls?

185
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,084
Can you hold on a second?

186
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,358
My balls.
Have you seen my balls?
The giant one and the red one.

187
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,591
Your plan isn't
going to work.

188
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,792
Of course it is.

189
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,732
I try to make you miserable
to make you leave.

190
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,201
You deny that it's
making you miserable,

191
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,795
you try to make me
miserable so I'll stop
making you miserable.

192
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,707
And eventually you will leave,
citing reasons that have
nothing to do with misery.

193
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,506
You're not bothering me.

194
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,637
Step one, complete.

195
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:27,550
I'm gonna call you from
my cell. And then I will
come back in here.

196
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,453
Hey. Yeah, I just had to
explain to him that
I had his balls,

197
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,051
and he's not getting
them back. Excuse me.

198
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,321
Sleep apnea explains...

199
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,454
Apnea would've disappeared
when she shrank.

200
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,329
Not if it destroyed
the musculature
of her trachea.

201
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,233
Apnea cuts off oxygen
to the brain, the resulting
neurological damage...

202
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,327
She been snoring?

203
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,428
She didn't mention it.

204
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,440
Did she mention feeling tired
after a full night's sleep?

205
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,840
No, but...
- This isn't apnea.

206
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,545
And this is a stupid room
to be doing a DDX in.

207
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,954
Cliff notes. Gastric bypass
only makes her skinny
on the outside.

208
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,689
On the inside we have heart
and lung issues not caused
by heart and lung issues.

209
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,027
Private area, House.
It can wait.

210
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,533
You need to consider
side-effects from her
gastric bypass surgery.

211
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,068
Forget the bypass.

212
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,626
Let the dying girl finish.

213
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,604
You said forget
the bypass...
Shh.

214
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,170
Dr. Thirteen
has the floor.

215
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,507
Bypass could create
malabsorption issues,
leads to low potassium.

216
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,104
Very stupid.
Her potassium is fine.

217
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,678
But her intestines aren't.

218
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,619
Gastric bypass could cause
malabsorption by creating
a blind loop of bowel.

219
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,316
It ulcerates during exercise,
bacteria get loose
in the blood stream,

220
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,755
migrate to the
heart and lungs.

221
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,690
Very not stupid.

222
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,094
Bacteria in the bowels means
there's bacteria in the poop.

223
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,791
Get some and test it.

224
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,426
He could have come up
with SIBO anywhere
else in the hospital.

225
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,470
You didn't need to
come down here
and screw with us.

226
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,029
But her wrong idea
led to his right one.
It was a vital screwing.

227
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,970
We think your surgery
might have caused
an infection called SIBO.

228
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:05,642
A stool test will help us
to confirm. Put some of
what you're full of in here.

229
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,351
If surgery could
somehow make you taller,
wouldn't you do it?

230
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,517
Sure, but I wouldn't
call a meeting of
the Lollipop Guild

231
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,223
and tell them they can grow
if they work real hard at it.

232
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,357
I don't tell anyone
not to get gastric bypass.

233
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,493
I tell them how to
get healthy, how to
improve their lives.

234
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,300
Yeah, by telling them to do
what you were unwilling to.

235
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,068
I was willing
to do anything.

236
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,304
Thyroid hormones,
crash diets,
none of it worked.

237
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,346
My body was
like a prison.

238
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:39,908
When I got the surgery,
I got healthy and when
I got healthy, I got happy.

239
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,786
I'm not sure you're happy.

240
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,484
But if you are,
being healthy didn't do it,
being pretty did.

241
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,117
Poop in the bedpan.

242
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,355
House's office? Really?

243
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,797
Did he send you here
to beg for it back?

244
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,232
There are dozens
of other doctors...

245
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,238
Other doctors actually use
their offices for crazy stuff
like seeing patients,

246
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,740
not throwing a ball
against the wall
and calling it work.

247
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,867
It's his process.
That ball saves lives.

248
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,912
Did he give you
talking points?

249
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,844
Yeah, but I added
one of my own.

250
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:13,374
Don't take his office
and pretend like all you're
doing is taking his office.

251
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,750
You chose his room
because you want to be there.

252
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:20,053
But sitting near him
and hoping isn't
going to get it done.

253
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,823
Leave here now
or I'll take your office.

254
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,593
No, you won't.

255
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,040
The boob lady e-mailed
me again, complaining
of chronic fatigue now.

256
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,371
She's convinced
the implants are
responsible.

257
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,933
They're not.
I told her.

258
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,172
She says something is
and if I don't find out what

259
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,613
she's gonna complain
to the Licensing Board.

260
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:44,910
It's not funny.
It is.

261
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,385
You just can't appreciate it
because it's going to
destroy your career.

262
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,089
What happened?
Did he call Foreman
clean and articulate again?

263
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,318
It is surprising.

264
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,827
Clinic patient's
just whining.

265
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,056
What's the poop?

266
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,064
It's going to take
about an hour to
spin down the sample.

267
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,793
What are we looking for?

268
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,494
You don't know?

269
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,665
I'm doing my famous
Socrates impression. Think
I really nailed the accent.

270
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,935
High fat content
indicates SIBO.

271
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,477
And what does
fat do in water?

272
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,568
It floats.

273
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,443
And what else
floats in water?

274
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,316
The correct answer is a duck.

275
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,418
If it doesn't float,
Kutner missed the boat.

276
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,533
Looks like I was wrong
to dismiss apnea.

277
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,198
You guys can stay up
all night gloating
in the sleep lab.

278
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,579
What about all that
scar tissue around the
implant, could that be...

279
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,741
That amount of encapsulation
is perfectly normal.

280
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,943
I gotta tell her something.

281
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,543
Tell her to find a decent
plastic surgeon who can
correct the placement...

282
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,249
Yeah, that's what she
wants to hear, she's sick
and she's lopsided.

283
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,124
Tell her it's a virus.
It probably is, and it'll get
her off your back for a few...

284
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,059
Emmy's EEG is flat-lining.

285
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,026
Where would she have gone?

286
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,603
Hey, I looked for you guys
in the control room,
but you seemed busy.

287
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,438
Get off of there,
last time you exercised
you had a cardiac incident.

288
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,569
I feel fine.
You felt fine last time.

289
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,739
I only slept a couple of hours
but I feel great.

290
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,043
Can I get one of
those machines?

291
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,310
You're running on
a broken ankle.

292
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,408
It doesn't hurt.

293
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,146
And your leg is bleeding.

294
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,690
You feel that?

295
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,058
What does that mean?

296
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,129
The numbness in her left foot
is ascending into her leg.

297
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,502
How'd she manage to
sneak out for a run?

298
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,303
She said she needed
to use the bathroom.

299
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,810
You two get the results
of the sleep apnea test,

300
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,607
or did those need to use
the bathroom, too?

301
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,875
Alpha waves on
the EEG ruled it out.

302
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,510
I was mixing some
hydrogen sulphide for
good and valid reasons

303
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,681
and must have spilled
some on my side.

304
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,122
Did it waft over
to your side?

305
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,351
Cunning plan.

306
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,361
You do realize
it's going to stink for
hours, on both sides.

307
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,896
Oh! Would you look
at the time?

308
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:17,066
I hope your patient isn't
still sick, forcing you
to stay here all night.

309
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,134
Ascending numbness means
her nerves are breaking down.

310
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,197
Or her brain.

311
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,709
Or both.

312
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,269
We've gotta go.
Let me finish,
I'll meet you down there.

313
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,874
You were 15 minutes late
yesterday. I don't want you
to develop bad habits.

314
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,144
Appreciate the life lesson,

315
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,778
but 15 minutes, give or take,
isn't going to make
a difference.

316
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,346
Get started on your
other patients, I'll be down
there when we're done here.

317
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,826
Way to know where
your bread is buttered,
sister. Up high.

318
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,692
If the problem
is in her brain,
it could be MS.

319
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,060
Or early onset
Parkinson's.

320
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,066
But if it's her nerves,
it could be transverse
myelitis.

321
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,068
Or a million other things.

322
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,400
We're gonna stay in the dark
until we can figure out

323
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:58,432
if her electrical problem
is in her power station or
in the high tension wires.

324
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:05,616
Power station's the brain,
wires are the nerves.
Run an NCV test.

325
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,484
The test will
measure the amount
of time it will take

326
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,685
this electrical impulse
to travel along your nerves.

327
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,228
Will it hurt?
No. Give me your arm.

328
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,661
You can ask nicely.

329
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,562
I learned in med school,
you don't actually
cure with kindness.

330
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,940
You're right,
I'm a hypocrite.

331
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,906
But I don't have a choice.

332
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,138
Not really interested
in your rationalizations.

333
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,740
If I'm open about the
gastric bypass, no one
would listen to me anymore.

334
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,647
You mean no one
would buy your DVDs.

335
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,552
It's not about the DVD sales.
I'm helping people.

336
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,786
My clients are making
themselves healthy.
They're living better lives.

337
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,660
Can you honestly tell me
you've never done
anything hypocritical?

338
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,998
I'm sure you
had good reasons.

339
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,700
Give me your arm, please.

340
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,039
Keep your arm raised.

341
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,450
Does this mean
something is wrong
with my nerves?

342
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,752
No. It's your muscles.

343
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,225
We don't need
to run this test.
It's not what we thought.

344
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,750
She has muscle
weakness, could indicate
myasthenia gravis.

345
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,047
Yeah.

346
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,418
Also could be
some kind of toxin.

347
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,787
Excuse me.
Are you going up to
the personnel floors?

348
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,156
I'm going to see Dr. House.

349
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,626
Do you have an
appointment with him?

350
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,458
We've been emailing.

351
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,327
Joint pain and fatigue
thanks to these.

352
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,423
I'm sure it's nothing.

353
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,990
Oh, now this.

354
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,463
He's actually downstairs.

355
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,268
Gone. Gone for the day.

356
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,640
But we work for him,
we can set you up in the ER.

357
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,745
The antibiotics will
make her feel better,
she's out of here by morning.

358
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,717
If it is a staph infection.
It's gotta be.

359
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:25,120
She has sleeves
of tattoos and piercings
from God knows where.

360
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,024
She has muscle weakness,
could indicate
myasthenia gravis.

361
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:36,124
I had the weirdest dream,
you guys did the test in
a reasonable amount of time

362
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,136
and came back here
before I had time
to fall asleep.

363
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,132
You guys still smell that?

364
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,777
Maybe you should just
let her have your office?

365
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,471
Or...

366
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,480
She sends one of yours
to the hospital,

367
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,641
send one of hers
to the morgue.

368
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,515
It's not myasthenia gravis,

369
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,487
her breathing's improving
and the weakness is
in her extremities.

370
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,654
Could be a botulinum reaction.

371
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:06,596
I don't think sabotaging
your boss' office is
a wise counterattack.

372
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,601
All that is needed
for evil to succeed is for
good men to do nothing.

373
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,637
She probably used
a lot of Botox to
tighten up her skin.

374
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,765
True. Could also be
any kind of heavy
metal toxicity.

375
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,967
PSP or arsenic
from eating too
much seafood,

376
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,138
cadmium from
bad bottled water,

377
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,183
lead or nickel
from canned fruits
or natural grains.

378
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:32,179
I don't think replacing
that was part of the
renovation plans.

379
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,690
It is now.

380
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,923
Lucky for us, we can treat
all those toxins with
the same thing, chelation.

381
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,837
You never showed up.

382
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,467
Get out of my house.

383
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:56,513
I wanted to find proof that
you were slipping back into
your self-destructive pattern,

384
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,549
confirm you weren't
worth my time.

385
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,745
Instead I found this.

386
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,390
You've followed
all of my instructions
to the letter,

387
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,393
probably better than
any patient I have.

388
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,259
So why are you the only one
who can't show up
for appointments?

389
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,231
I came down
right after I was
finished with House.

390
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,631
You were in your office
with another patient.

391
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,127
And there was another patient
in the waiting room.

392
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,236
Janice.

393
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:26,172
I'm well aware of what's going
to happen to my body over
the next eight to 10 years.

394
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:29,805
I do not need a visual
reminder every time
I walk into that place.

395
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,676
That's understandable.

396
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,354
It's human.

397
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,127
And you need
to get over it.

398
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,597
Now, you show up
on time tomorrow or
you don't show up at all.

399
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,605
Your mom is leaving.
You're gonna regret this
the rest of your life.

400
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,283
The chelation didn't
work, her muscles are
still deteriorating.

401
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:11,448
Rules out toxins. So what
else that can go wrong when
the <i>Hindenburg</i> deflates?

402
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,218
Why aren't we doing
this in your office?

403
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:17,387
Obviously because it would be
stupid to do this in an office
with no furniture.

404
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:21,330
Cuddy overreacted
to my overreaction.

405
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,164
Coronaro-cardiac fistula.
Even a small hole
could cause...

406
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,932
They start in the lungs,
not the heart.

407
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:31,339
And why are you leaning
on a 45 degree angle
away from Foreman?

408
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,301
I'm sitting straight.

409
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,846
Trouble in the
Land of False Hope?

410
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,940
Everything is fine.
Austrian syndrome.

411
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:43,010
Nice deflection,
but our patient doesn't drink,
she's a health nut.

412
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,749
And even if I was
a cynical guy and
thought she was a liar,

413
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:49,385
I would have done a tox
screen which would've come
back negative for alcohol.

414
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,258
You should come to these
gatherings more often,

415
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,956
keep you from
looking like an idiot.

416
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,469
You making book
or did something else
happen to our patient?

417
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,200
Personal.
I'll put it on vibrate.

418
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,506
Guillain-Barr?.

419
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,411
Usually starts as a muscle
pain patients compare to
the pain of over-exercising.

420
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,950
So who's paging you?
Your wife?

421
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,077
Does it worry you
that she paged
Kutner first?

422
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:18,645
Guillain-Barr? fits,
patient didn't notice
the initial symptoms

423
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,453
because it's no different
than how she feels every day.

424
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:24,518
Her muscle weakness
is the precursor to
full paralysis.

425
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,364
Gastric bypass
probably set it off.

426
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:33,699
At what price beauty?
Go start her on
plasmapheresis.

427
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:44,443
<i>She put</i>
<i>the lime in the coconut</i>
<i>She drank it all up</i>

428
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,815
<i>She put the lime</i>
<i>in the coconut</i>
<i>She drank it all up</i>

429
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:51,720
Deedee? Can you
stop singing?

430
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,726
Musical automatism,
she could be having
a partial seizure right now.

431
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:56,783
You need to get House.

432
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,056
Deedee!

433
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,393
Yelling at her
is not gonna be
an effective treatment.

434
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,831
She's faking.
It's a cry for attention.

435
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,368
Her brain could be misfiring.

436
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:08,429
Right, a rare neurological
disorder is far more likely
than a cry for attention.

437
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,839
I mean, nothing about
this woman screams
"look at me."

438
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,309
On the other hand,
look at her.

439
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:20,080
She needs a full neurological
work-up. Get House.

440
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,919
Ultimate irony.
I killed myself trying
to make myself healthy.

441
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:31,451
You're not dying, okay?
This disease is manageable.

442
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,362
Better start getting
used to that wheelchair.

443
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,764
Self-pity doesn't suit you.

444
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,893
Just take me down to the...

445
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:41,735
No. You're strong
enough to walk.

446
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,832
Come on, get your ass
out of bed and walk.

447
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,714
Could be an aneurysm,
we've got to control
her blood pressure,

448
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,419
start her on a calcium
channel blocker.

449
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,088
Or you could tell House.

450
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,653
I can't tell House.

451
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,130
You'll be in trouble.

452
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,962
On the other hand,
she's sick.

453
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,093
She's singing.

454
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:14,263
And bleeding out of her ears
and losing her hair.

455
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,966
And an aneurysm
doesn't explain
her joint pain.

456
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,167
Wilson's disease does.

457
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,607
No Kayser-Fleischer rings.

458
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,666
Anorexia.

459
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,075
Now you're just desperate.

460
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,343
Biliary tumor causing
paraneoplastic syndrome.

461
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,513
That might actually fit.
I'll scan to confirm.

462
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,489
You'd do that for me?
You don't have the time.

463
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:37,017
Which means I can ask
for 25% of your income
and you'll give it to me.

464
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,468
You going over the fence?

465
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,873
It took three visits,
but I finally convinced
the contractor

466
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:56,346
that I'm Cuddy's boss
and all the office renovation
plans need to go through me.

467
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,507
You did do the
math on this, right?

468
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,051
Screwing with her office
means her renovations
will take longer,

469
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,144
means she'll be
in your office longer.

470
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:08,056
See there?
I'm having a bidet put
in instead of a toilet.

471
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,822
Not in addition to,
instead of.

472
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,886
You want to know
what happened to
the old toilet?

473
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,559
She'll be with you
where you claim
to not want her.

474
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,503
I smashed it with
a sledgehammer.

475
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,836
I think in some
ancient cultures

476
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,535
that was actually considered
a proposal of marriage.

477
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:31,705
Is this fun for you?
Analyzing everyone
else's fun away?

478
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:35,082
Ask her out, it'll cost
the hospital a lot less.

479
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,522
I brought some visitors.
Cheer you up.

480
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,427
It's okay,
come on in, guys.

481
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,058
We're all staying
on your plan.
Nobody's cheating.

482
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:53,070
That's great.
You're on my arm.

483
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:57,632
We found out about your
gastric bypass. How could
you lie to us like that?

484
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,610
The doctors told you?
You're really hurting my arm.

485
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,477
You're not the best you
you can be.

486
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,446
You're a fraud.
You're a self-hating
fat person.

487
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,781
You're
really hurting me.

488
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,286
Feel the burn.

489
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,017
Burn. Burn.

490
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,615
Help. Help!

491
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,526
Burn. Burn! Burn!

492
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,426
Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!
Help!

493
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,828
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

494
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,412
Mood congruent
hallucinations.

495
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,844
Means it's
not Guillain-Barr?.

496
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,712
Which means whatever it is,
it's now in her brain.

497
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:42,780
Where are you going?

498
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,845
Sorry. Treatment.

499
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:48,154
Does Foreman schedule
your appointments by
numbers on the clock,

500
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,887
or just by when I'm in
the middle of something?

501
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:53,863
Sorry if I'm dying
at a bad time for you.
Could be CNS lymphoma.

502
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,492
So losing the 200 pounds
was just a coincidence?

503
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,232
What about a prion disease?

504
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,202
If her brain is
slowly turning into
a Swiss cheese,

505
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,905
there's not
a lot we can do.

506
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,146
There are some
possible treatments.

507
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,048
Get a brain biopsy to confirm.

508
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,020
You are not cutting
into this woman's brain
before you test.

509
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,783
That is the test.

510
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,415
Not for CNS lymphoma,

511
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:26,863
which is a perfectly
legitimate diagnosis, one you
can test for non-invasively.

512
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,195
You're, obviously,
not opposed to
being invasive.

513
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,863
Rule out CNS lymphoma first,
then rule out astrocytoma,

514
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,633
then rule out
other brain tumors...

515
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,705
I hereby declare
them ruled out.

516
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,268
Run the tests.

517
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,179
You can do a brain biopsy,
but only as a last resort.

518
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:51,147
Start running down
Cuddy's list of
"Diseases it's not."

519
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,095
You're not stopping me
for medical reasons.

520
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,561
You're stopping me
because you have
the hots for me.

521
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,173
You're still here
because you have
the hots for me.

522
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:15,371
Evidenced by the fact
that I'm the one who
moved into your office.

523
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,437
It's the biggest office.
And I'm not the one that...

524
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:22,214
Why are you dressed like that?
Why do you try so hard
to get my attention?

525
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,453
Are you screwing with me?

526
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,549
Are you screwing with me?

527
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,791
Depends on your answer.

528
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,100
Everybody knows
this is going somewhere.

529
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,303
I think we're supposed
to kiss now.

530
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,637
We already did that.

531
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,888
Seemed like the
logical next step.

532
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:58,980
Really?

533
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,520
I'm an idiot for
being surprised.

534
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,593
Can you leave these?

535
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,498
I'll keep coming.
But can you change
my appointment time?

536
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,659
Can't. Schedule's full.

537
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,932
You're stuck with her,
might as well get to know her.

538
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,823
Your head MRI was clean,
means you don't have
CNS lymphoma.

539
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,018
What's next on the list?

540
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,152
Other types
of brain tumors.

541
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,490
Can we stop
at the cafeteria?

542
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:46,655
I can have something
brought up for you.

543
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,029
What do you want?
Chocolate cake.

544
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,968
You can't give up.
We're going to
figure this out.

545
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,374
What am I supposed
to be hoping for?
That you find a brain tumor?

546
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:02,944
What else could it be?

547
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,012
You were so hard
on me about lying.

548
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,248
How about you take some
of your own advice
and tell me the truth?

549
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,816
What's next on the list?

550
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,451
Prion disease.

551
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,920
And if that's what I got?
How bad?

552
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,564
There are a few treatments.
But there's no guarantee.

553
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,104
I'm sorry.

554
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,573
And you won't let me
have a piece of cake?

555
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,890
Where's Cuddy?

556
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,721
It's not CNS lymphoma.

557
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,788
I know.

558
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,159
She's getting worse,
you want me to find Cuddy

559
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,500
and get her approval
for the brain biopsy?

560
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:07,167
When you were
philandering with impunity,
how did that feel?

561
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:14,649
Superficially, I loved it,
but deep down I think
I was miserable.

562
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,880
Why? What's going on?

563
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,182
You weren't miserable.

564
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,155
You gave something away
to make a relationship work,

565
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,753
you rationalized
that you're getting
something back.

566
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:32,499
Okay. I'm gonna go get
Cuddy's approval
for the brain biopsy.

567
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,869
Leave them there.
I'm gonna do
the biopsy myself.

568
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,607
Cuddy wanted us to eliminate
seven different things.

569
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,442
Cuddy doesn't always
get what she wants.

570
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,914
Bad idea to get
into a power play with
somebody who has the power.

571
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:50,113
You're fired.
Just reinforcing
your point.

572
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,022
Whatever personal drama
you're playing out,
you'd be a lot smarter to...

573
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,657
I thought you said
she was sick.

574
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:09,267
Sick people don't
spontaneously get better.

575
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,865
Yes, they do, it's called
an immune system.

576
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,736
Sick people
who are sick enough
to make it to me

577
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,303
don't spontaneously
get better.

578
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:20,714
Not as pithy, but yeah,
technically more accurate.

579
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,047
What's the last
thing you gave her?

580
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,679
I took her for a MRI
looking for...

581
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,087
MRIs detect,
they don't treat.

582
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,648
What did you give her
after the MRI?

583
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:32,321
I didn't give her anything,
she got depressed at
the lack of direction.

584
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,762
We went to the cafeteria
for some chocolate cake,

585
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:38,199
took her to her room,
hung a banana bag,
let her rest.

586
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,899
You gave her cake?

587
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,304
She asked for it,
I figured...

588
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:46,832
You figured you'd
let me play 20 questions
instead of just telling me.

589
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:00,722
Feeling crappy again?
I've brought your cure.

590
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,319
I'd give you
an IV of the stuff,

591
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:10,163
but the frosting
tends to get stuck
in the little tube.

592
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,428
Is this a joke?

593
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,768
It's not a joke, not a lie,
not an attempt to
defraud in any way.

594
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,709
Just an actual licensed
physician with an
actual diagnosis.

595
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,212
Hereditary coproporphyria.

596
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:33,285
Your face is genetically
blessed, your body chemistry
is slightly less so,

597
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,660
doesn't make enough of
a certain enzyme that
I can't pronounce,

598
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:41,357
but it's apparently
important for your liver
and everything else.

599
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,992
Treatment is
a high-carb diet,
rich in sugar.

600
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,832
When you were a porker,
you were self-medicating.

601
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,338
So this is treatable?

602
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,204
We just have to reverse
your gastric bypass

603
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,142
and get you back
on a high-carb,
glucose enriched diet.

604
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,545
The best you you can be
is a lot more you.

605
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:02,045
Open the hangar,
here comes the plane.

606
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,144
There's nothing else
you can try?

607
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,886
No. There's a drug that
manages the symptoms
but it's not a cure.

608
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,619
Let's try that.

609
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,863
You don't want to
have the surgery?

610
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,971
Understand.

611
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:28,712
There's not many people who
have the guts to admit they'd
rather be pretty than healthy.

612
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,247
Income's better and
you get more action.

613
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,552
We'll start you on your
drug treatment right away.

614
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,017
I bought it. I bought that
it was really about

615
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,857
trying to make
people's lives
a little better.

616
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,362
You're surprised
she's superficial?

617
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,990
You're a plastic surgeon.
This is the human condition.

618
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,533
No, she's a freak.

619
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,501
Every time you
put someone under
to bob their nose,

620
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,094
you were
risking their life.

621
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,806
What?

622
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,739
No singing. She's better.

623
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,046
No one was supposed to
let my patient leave her bed.

624
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,278
She had
a respiratory arrest,

625
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,219
we coded her
nearly 20 minutes,
but she didn't make it.

626
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:18,758
House is an unemotional
child incapable of
intimacy or romance.

627
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,956
Trust me.
It's done.

628
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,294
It's perfect.

629
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,163
I like the desk.
A lot of character.

630
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,837
That's not the
one I ordered.

631
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,839
This is my desk
from med school.

632
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,414
You have it in storage
or something?

633
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,712
My mom did.

634
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,912
That was sweet
of her to do that.

635
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,946
She didn't.
My mom has no idea
I'm redoing my office.

636
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,237
I lied to you
the other night.

637
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:13,383
That woman in the
waiting room, she didn't
freak me out about my future.

638
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:18,050
She freaked me
out about my past.

639
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,419
Your mother.

640
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,525
Must have been horrible
watching her die.

641
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,358
I wanted her to die.

642
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:37,200
She just yelled so much.

643
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,737
And for no reason.
Just screamed at me
in front of my friends.

644
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:48,683
My father tried to explain
to me that her brain
was literally shrinking,

645
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:53,588
that she didn't mean it,
that it was the disease.

646
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,522
But I didn't care.

647
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,552
I hated her.

648
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,497
I never said goodbye,

649
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,037
and she died
with me hating her.

650
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,791
Did Chase test
for the biliary tumor?

651
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,853
He said it was negative.

652
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,025
She was stable
when he left her.

653
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,898
We should have
found more time,
we should have...

654
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,664
House is gonna kill us.

655
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,005
Slowly

656
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,468
and painfully.

657
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:54,579
You're not only
idiots, you're frauds.
Fraudulent idiots.

658
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,780
Fraudulent idiotic killers,
as it turns out.

659
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,517
House, this was really my...
Your fault, yeah!

660
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,889
For pretending to be me
when you're not
even competent.

661
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,487
And your fault for not
ratting him out while
the patient was still alive.

662
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:14,434
What she had was
easily treatable,
she could have been fine.

663
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,567
Damn treatment's
so simple.

664
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,504
It might still be possible.

665
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,706
House?

666
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,915
House? House,
she's clearly dead.

667
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,145
Oh, God! Oh, God!

668
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,017
She was dead.

669
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,551
She wasn't dead.
She wasn't even sick,
you moron.

670
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:44,428
Seriously, how good was she?
No formal training.
At least not in acting.

671
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,764
Did you see their faces?

672
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,033
I think we may have
an anal hygiene
violation there.

673
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,266
So the CT?

674
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,004
That was from a patient
three years ago.
That was hard to find.

675
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,568
But the hair, makeup,

676
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:59,207
getting Chase and Cameron
to play along, much easier.

677
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,446
We deserved it.
I'll take down
the website before...

678
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,251
Take it down? You kidding?
It's way too lucrative
to shut it down.

679
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,587
For Chase, for me.

680
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,687
I earn 50% for letting
you use my name.

681
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,764
Chop, chop, go to work,
first dollars go to expenses.

682
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,701
I booked our little thespian
here for two full days.

683
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,499
That's three G's I owe her.

684
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,540
And you still got
three hours left.

685
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:29,806
Do I?
