186
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,334

to be done,

193

I would have done it
in the year he spent dying.

194
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:26,501

197
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,267
So the vicodin is my leash.

198
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,100
One'll take the edge off,

199
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,501

Drugs and alcohol wouldn't--
She's a smoker.

Combine smoking with any one

238
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:51,067
Two months,
not one word.

239
00:11:51,134 --> 00:11:54,067
Anything he wanted to say,
he typed up

240
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:55,733
and slipped under
my bedroom door.

241
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,668

don't say anything, but go.

Just by being there,
i'd be lying.

244
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:06,967

for a moment,

245
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:08,733
that she had a happy family.

246
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,100
So give her a gift--
lie!

00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:15,434
Give me my cane...
I'll go to the damn funeral.

248
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:37,833
I said I'd go to the funeral.

249
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,100
I didn't say when.

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,568
We have these two categories:
inside and outside.

251
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,867
Patients stay inside.

252
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:51,867
Then, when they're better,
we let them go outside.

253
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,301
Thanks.

254
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,634
But they don't
let you smoke inside.

255
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,501
<i>So why don't you
go back there</i>

256
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,201
and give me five minutes
outside?

257
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:11,434
Make a fist.

258
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,301
It's such a beautiful day,

259
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,767
<i>we thought we'd do
all our doctorg outside.</i>

260
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,000
People stare at me any time
i'm out with my family.

261
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:25,167
It's like a puzzle.

262
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:27,634
"which one of these things
doesn't belong?"

263
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,668
belonging's overrated.

264
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:33,700
I was adopted by a white family
when I was nine.

265
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,067
I like being different.

266
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:38,201
The view's better
from the outside looking in.

267
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Must be easier to be different
when you're a success.

268
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,201
Is that a problem?

269
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,134
This is why
we prefer inside.

270
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:05,200
You actually keep a flashlight
that doesn't need batteries

271
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:06,234

272
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,200

290
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,367

00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:15,100

00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:48,267
I have moved on.

310
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,701
What do you think house

it was from him.

I didn't tell yo
so you could send anything.

318
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:13,067

She's bleeding and clotting?

321
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:18,234
Plus schistocytes
on her smear means it's dic,

322
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,567
which means she's got cancer.

323
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:21,400
She's young.
It could be leukemia.

324
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:23,133
Normal wbc makes tha
less likely.

325
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,701
The belly pain points
toward a g.i. Tumor.

326
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,100

an ultrasound.

327

When my father died,
I wound up killing a patient.

332
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:40,467
And I hated the man.

333
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,501
Whatever house says
or doesn't say,

334
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,567

He was still your father.

337

You're biologically programmed
to have feelings for him.

No, I'm not.

00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:56,734

I know you have trouble

<i>that can't be antified
and counted.</i>

342
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:02,367
He's not my biological father.

343
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,100
I figured it out
when I was 12.

344
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,567
<i>Of course.</i>

345
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:12,267
You were a brilliant,
socially isolated 12-year-old,

346
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:14,200
and you create
a parallel universe

Ansince

353
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,567
air travel was impossible.

into the mirror,

531
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:04,701
which successfully conveyed
my message.

532
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:07,834
And smashed a ten-foot
antique mirror.

533
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:10,901
And set an emple
to two other patrons

534
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:12,100
who threw shot glasses.

535
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,400
<i>I had nothing to do
with that fight.</i>

536
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:17,100
The assault charge
was totally bogus.

537
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,067
And I paid
for the mirror.

538
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,434
I think I have
the picture.

539
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,133
I assume you're the guy
who was playing the song.

540
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,234
No, I was the guy
who bailed him out.

541
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,634
That's how we met.
I was in jail.

542
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,000
This guy was
a total stranger to you,

543
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:33,167
and you bailed him out?

544
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:35,067
It was a boring convention.

545
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,067
Had to have somebody
to drink with.

546
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,601
<i>(Wilson)
and there's the foundation
of our entire friendship.</i>

547
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,767
If you hadn't been bored
one weekend,

548
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,734
it wouldn't even exi.

549
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:45,834
Hey, there were 3,000 people
at that convention.

550
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:46,801
You were the one I thought
wasn't boring.

551
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:48,067
That says something.

552
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:49,968
It also says something
that you lied to me

553
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:51,534
about getting
the charges dropped!
I got a lawyer.

554
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:52,734
He cut a deal.

555
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:53,868
You didn't call the guy?

556
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:54,868
You ve to show up
at the arraignment.

557
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,267
Everybody knows that.

558
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:58,734
Everybody with
your misdemeanor experience.

559
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:00,000
You can go.

560
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,634
What?!

561
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:04,934
He--he's a fugitive
from justice.

562
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,434
That whole story was lies.
Stabbed a man.

563
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:10,033
Louisiana doesn't want to pay

564
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,267
to get you back.
Forget louisiana.

565
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:17,200
He was driving recklessly
through your comatose village.

566
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,701
Do theput lead
in the jelly doughnuts here?

567
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,968
Stop acting
like such an ingrate

568
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:22,334
and go pay your respects
to your father.

569
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:27,300
The ct confirmed
gallstones.

570
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:30,467
Normally not dangerous.
Almost everyone has them.

571
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:31,767
But sometimes...

572
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,534
They kill you?

573
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:36,567
yup.
Unless I take 'em out.

574
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:38,100
We do it laproscopically.

575
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:41,200
Um...

576
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:45,133
How long has her urine
been brown?

577
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,734
Kidney's were fine
this afternoon.

578
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:48,767
They're not now.

579
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
It's not the gallstones.

580
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:57,601
(house)
well, of course
it's not gallstones.

581
00:25:57,668 --> 00:25:58,867
Who thought
it was gallstones?

582
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,401
You said "steamroller."

583
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,200
I also said
"construction site."

584
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:04,034
Gallstones could cause
a pancreatic cyst.

585
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,501
Just turn around.

586
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:09,234
<i>The thing is
twhours over already,</i>

587
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,467
and that's the third time
we passed that colonial

588
00:26:10,534 --> 00:26:12,701
with the cross bni
out front.

589
00:26:12,768 --> 00:26:14,634
I'm not lost.

590
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:16,734
I'm not talking
about what caused the cyst.

591
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,234
I'm talking
about what the cyst caused.

592
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:19,900
<i>Everything.</i>

593
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,234
Cysts are symptoms,
not diagnoses.

594
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:23,434
Unless it's a multiple ct,

595
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:24,634
with conctions
to other organs--

596
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:26,134
Like a steamroller.

597
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,401
That's a long road down
to the kidneys.

598
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:30,933
How do we prove it?
Won't be visible in a scan.

599
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,267
Chase isn't gonna go
groping around

600
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:34,467
when she's got kidney failure.
Bubbs.

601
00:26:34,534 --> 00:26:36,434
Is that your new
stripper name?

602
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:38,768
Yes. And also,
we inject bubbles into the cys

603
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:39,867
and foll where ty drift.

604
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,367
If they end up
in the other organs,

605
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,601
<i>we know you're right,
cut it out, she's fine.</i>

606
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:43,900
Bubbles is right.

607
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:45,067
<i>Go echo.</i>

608
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,967
I'm not lost.

609
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:08,267
Nicole, you gotta stay still.

610
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:09,434
I'm--i'm nervous.

611
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:11,134
You'reot nervous.

612
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,467
It's the dts, isn't it?

613
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:17,267
I haven't had a drink
since I got here.

614
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:22,367
Good heavens,
we haven't missed it after all.

615
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,833
<i>It's like the end
of christmas carol.</i>

616
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,301
[sighs]

617
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:40,034
i'm so glad you're here.

618
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,967
Oh, it's a load
off of my mind

619
00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:45,034
just to see you.

620
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,467
Thank you, james.

621
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:48,833
Mom, how could you delay
the funeral?

622
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,734
Honey, your dad is dead.
He's not going to care.

623
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,334
Do you know what
you're going to say?

624
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:55,634
I don't know.

625
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:56,967
Just let the minister

626
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:58,434
orne of his buddies
from the corps...

627
00:27:58,501 --> 00:27:59,768
You're talking.

628
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,768
I don't care
that you didn't like him.

629
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,734
He was your father,
and he loved you.

630
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,534
The war is over, greg.

631
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:09,867
Please do this for me.

632
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:16,234
Stop looking so worried.

633
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:18,501
I know he's
gonna make me proud.

634
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:22,034
I'm sure you know him better
than I do.

635
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,501
Her liver's
been compromised.

636
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:31,800
<i>And the dts will cause
her muscles</i>

637
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:33,601
<i>to continue to twitch,
even underedation.</i>

638
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:35,534
We need to paralyze her
to do this procedure.

639
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:37,434
I wanted to stop.

640
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,367
<i>A phenarbital coma
willot only low us</i>

641
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:42,401
to inject the cyst,
'll treat the dts.

642
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,401
When she wakes up,
e won't be in withdrawal.

643
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:47,501
We've seen her
through withdrawal before.

644
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:50,701
We've seen her
through everything.

645
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:54,034
<i>We've been supportive,
we've been combative.</i>

646
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,434
We've picked her up from bars
in the middle of the night.

647
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:56,900
We've let her
spend the night in jail.

648
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,367
I used to say
it'd be okay.

649
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:04,434
<i>That I'd get it together.</i>

650
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:06,634
I don't say that anymore.

651
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,933
Let's make you healthy.

652
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,501
Then we'll worry
about making you sober.

653
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:16,067
The lord is my shepherd,

654
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:17,734
<i>i shall not want...</i>

655
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,601
I am not talking.

656
00:29:20,668 --> 00:29:22,234
We were strangers

657
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,967
who shared some geography
30 years ago.

658
00:29:24,034 --> 00:29:27,401
Right, he had no influence
on you at all.

659
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,134
The father who was compulsive
about punctuality.

660
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,301
His issue.

661
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,100
Which I deliberately made
not my issue.

662
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:35,134
Thereby making it your issue.

663
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,601
Compulsively showing up
four hours late,

664
00:29:37,668 --> 00:29:39,601
ignoring discipline,
ignoring rules.

665
00:29:39,668 --> 00:29:41,867
Oh, god, he's here.

666
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:43,334
Who's here?

667
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:46,768
The one you're pretending
is yr father?

668
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:51,000
Nice pick.
He looks like sean connery.

669
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:53,601
So back when you
were devising this fantasy,

670
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,100
did you tell your father:

671
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:58,401
"dad, I fuse to recognize
your existence because

672
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:00,967
I have chosen james bond
as my dad"?

673
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:01,800
<i>(Minister)
let us pray.</i>

674
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:04,034
I used different words.

675
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,833
What?!

676
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,167
Hearing your own son
hates you so much

677
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:13,334
he's replaced you
in his mind?

678
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:14,800
That's gotta suck.
How did he take it?

679
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:16,701
I already told you.

680
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,900
<i>(Minister)
amen.</i>

681
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:21,534
He didn't speak to me
for a summer.

682
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:31,634
It means more to me than--
An I can say

683
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:33,200
to have all of you
here today.

684
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:37,601
And w,h,
our son gregory

685
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:40,467
would ke to say
a few words.

686
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:45,367
Greg?

687
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:04,234
[sighs]

688
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:05,867
there's a lot of people
here today.

689
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:09,467
Inuding some
from the corps.

690
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,000
And I notice tha
every one of them is

691
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:16,634
either my father rank
or higher.

692
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:19,000
And that doesn't
surprise me.

693
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:23,100
Because if the test
of a man

694
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:28,134
is how he treats those
he has power over,

695
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,034
it was a test
my father failed.

696
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:37,134
<i>This man you're eage
to pay homage to,</i>

697
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,768
he was incapable of admitting
any int of view but his own.

698
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,200
<i>He punished failure,</i>

699
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:47,734
and he did not accept
anything lesthan--

700
00:31:58,267 --> 00:32:02,768
He loved doing what he did.

701
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,900
He saw his work
as some kind of...

702
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:09,000
Sacred calling.

703
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:11,334
More important
than any personal relationship.

704
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,833
Maybe if he'd been
a better father,

705
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,833
i'd be a better son.

706
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:25,200
But I am what I am
because of him...

707
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:29,401
For better or foworse.

708
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:34,501
And I just--just wish--
[voice breaks]

709
00:33:08,668 --> 00:33:11,768
[whispers]
put it back.

710
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:12,933
Well, he's
not gonna Miss it.

711
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,734
I'm done enablg.

712
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,267
You can't even let them
put him in the ground

713
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:18,134
without making it serve
your agenda?

714
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,534
<i>(House)
you real want to do this
in front oeverybody?</i>

715
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:23,234
you wanna punish me
or them?

716
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,768
How can I
still feel surprise?

717
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,234
You would take,
even this,

718
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:42,301
a moment of real
human grief,

719
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,301
and turn it into a farce.

720
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:45,467
Oh, cut the crap.

721
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:47,367
You enjoy what I do.

722
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:48,467
I never had to force you.

723
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:49,800
You like coming along
for the ride.

724
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:52,200
Yes, that's why
i'm cheering you on no

725
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:55,401
this is about you needing
to be prepared for the worst.

726
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,234
So you become
an oncologist.

727
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,534
No surprises there.
Worst happens all the time.

728
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:02,301
But amber, she was young
and healthy.

729
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:03,701
Her death came
out of nowhere.

730
00:34:03,768 --> 00:34:05,200
Don't bring amber
into this.

731
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:08,134
And you weren't ready.
That makes you angry.

732
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,100
The world sucks, and y didn't
have time to brace youelf.

733
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:12,200
What happened out there
is your show!

734
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:15,267
You' scared to death
of losing anyone that matters.

735
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:16,601
So you dump the person
who matters the most to you!

736
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:19,567
I'm not scared to death.
I'm moving forward!

737
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:20,668
Because no one
can take away from you

738
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:21,701
what you no longer have.

739
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,034
[wilson gives derisive laugh]

740
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,467
your father's death is
about you.

741
00:34:25,534 --> 00:34:27,334
Amber's death is
about you.

742
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:29,134
I can'imagine why someone
wouldn't want to be your friend!

743
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,167
Admit it, you're ary
and you're scared

744
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:33,267
of losing me.

745
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:35,100
I'm not angry, I'm not scared.
Admit it.

746
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,634
I'm not afraid.
Admit it.

747
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,800
I've lost people.
It happens.
Admit it. Admit it!

748
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:41,000
What are you, five?
Stop repeating--

749
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:42,833
Admit it. Admit it.
Admit it. Admit it.

750
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,967
Admit it. Admit it.
Admit it.

751
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:45,134
Come on, admit it.
Admit it!

752
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,134
unh!

753
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:53,434
Still not boring.

754
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:58,001
(wilson)
did u know
I was gonna do that?

755
00:34:58,068 --> 00:35:00,100
Because I didn't know
I was gonna do that.

756
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,701
I know you have trouble
losing people.

757
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,801
In new orleans,

758
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,267
I saw you carrying
this express package

759
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:07,834
around the conference.

760
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:10,634
And you wouldn't let it go,
but you wouldn't open it.

761
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:13,867
So I peeked
at the return address.

762
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:15,367
Diamond, fairbairn.

763
00:35:15,434 --> 00:35:17,767
Divorce attorneys.

764
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,300
Your first wife
had just served you with papers.

765
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,200
Did you know that
when you bailed me out?

766
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:25,334
Were you...
Doing something niceor me?

767
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,968
What did I say
about being boring?

768
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:32,667
Wewe your mom
an apology.

769
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:34,267
[ringing]
hello?

770
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:36,133
It's house.

771
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,567
<i>Ouse over speakerphone]
how'd the bubble test go?</i>

772
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:38,767
the problem wasn't
the cyst.

773
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:39,901
It's advanced dilated
cardiomyopathy.

774
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:41,400
We did a three-dimensial echo.

775
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:42,734
Showed a mass
in the left atrium.

776
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:44,867
<i>(Kutner)
looks like an atrial moma,</i>

777
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,601
but the ultrasound images
are a little grainy,

778
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,233
<i>so it's hard to tell.</i>

779
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,334
hous

780
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,267
The images aren't grainy.

781
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:52,867
They sure look grainy.

782
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:55,200
I've seen picturesf you
where you look tall.

783
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:56,801
<i>It's iron overload.</i>

784
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:59,267
<i>Creates speckles on the image,
makes it look grainy.</i>

785
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:01,367
<i>Also makes her pancreas fa,
her blood clot,</i>

786
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:03,667
<i>and her intestine--
Atrial myxoma is more lily.</i>

787
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:05,267
Mri for a better view.

788
00:36:05,334 --> 00:36:07,200
<i>And call me back
and tell me you're embarrassed</i>

789
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:11,534
because my eyesight is better
500 miles away.

790
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:13,001
<i>I need a phone number.</i>

791
00:36:13,068 --> 00:36:17,701
[telephone ringing]

792
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,300
[speaking native language]

793
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:22,667
i'm a doctor in new jersey,
treating one of your clients.

794
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:25,400
A young woman looking
for her biological parents.

795
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:26,968
You know, you could just wait
for the mri

796
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:29,734
to have your cursity
satisfied.

797
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:32,034
What person
who is nothing like me

798
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,834
are you saying that to?

799
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,367
Did the parents look tan?

800
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:38,367
<i>The disease she has
is genetic,</i>

801
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:40,068
<i>which means
they shod have it too.</i>

802
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:41,734
They don't look more tan
than anyone else.

803
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:43,801
Discolored teeth?

804
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,034
They're farmers--the village
doesn't even have a dentist.

805
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,934
Right. Thanks.

806
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:49,567
<i>But if it matters,</i>

807
00:36:49,634 --> 00:36:51,068
i'm not convinced
they were her parents.

808
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:52,567
Why not?

809
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:54,233
<i>Because they said
they have no daughter.</i>

810
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,767
The man was adamant,

811
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:57,968
<i>and the woman seemed confused
and frightened.</i>

812
00:36:58,034 --> 00:37:00,001
Thank you.

813
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:03,367
Differential.

814
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:06,300
<i>Say you're a middle-aged
inese woman...</i>

815
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:08,434
Fine.
Say it.

816
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,567
I'm a middle-aged
chinese woman.

817
00:37:10,634 --> 00:37:11,968
<i>Girl comes to you,</i>

818
00:37:12,034 --> 00:37:14,001
says that she's
your long-lost daughter.

819
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:15,601
<i>Why would yo
be frightened?</i>

820
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:19,901
i'm frightened
because she's a threat?

821
00:37:19,968 --> 00:37:21,267
Maybe she knows something?

822
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:23,934
She hasn't seen you since
shwas an infant.

823
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:25,667
Maybe an inheritance issue.

824
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:28,200
They're peasants.

825
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:31,534
Her very presence is
a threat.

826
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:34,467
She--
What year was she born?

827
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:35,834
'83.

828
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:39,467
She's not supposed
be alive.

829
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:42,667
China introduced
the one-child policy in 1979.

830
00:37:42,734 --> 00:37:45,200
Say they didn't want
a girl.

831
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,667
They tried to kill her.

832
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:48,133
Maybe the baby doesn't die.

833
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,801
Maybe the father panics
or regrets it.

834
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,734
Takes the baby
to an orphanage.

835
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:53,968
Maybe he doesn't tell
his wife.

836
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:56,400
Who freaks out
like she's seen a ghost

837
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:58,233
25 years later
when the girl shows up.

838
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,167
Why does attempted murder
om 25 years ago

839
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:02,968
suddenly become relevant
to her health now?

840
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:05,233
Maybe they gave her
something toxic.

841
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,767
It would have to be
fat soluble.

842
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,968
This is fun, isn't it?

843
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:20,233
Let me see the mri.

844
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,901
We don't have one.

845
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:24,334
She started vomiting
as soon as we started the scan.

846
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,801
Then let her vomit
through the mri.

847
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:28,667
That'shanurses are for.

848
00:38:28,734 --> 00:38:32,034
Her parents
tried to kill her.

849
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,667
<i>I don't know how,</i>

850
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:36,233
but I know it caused her
to get sick 25 years later

851
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,500
trying to lift a buddha.

852
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:41,367
Explain.

853
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:42,934
I already had this conversation
with wilson--just go with it.

854
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,567
Poison?

855
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:45,867
Buddha
wouldn't make it worse.

856
00:38:45,934 --> 00:38:47,701
Maybe the weight
stressed her back, which--

857
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:50,367
Makes sense if she's never
lifted anything in her life.

858
00:38:50,434 --> 00:38:51,934
She actually didn't
get sick

859
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:53,400
<i>till she tried lifting it
that second time.</i>

860
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:55,001
I'm guessing
the weight changed.

861
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:00,667
Anybody have taub's
pager number?

862
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:02,367
What's up?

863
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,068
Maybe give him a call.

864
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:08,300
If he tosses that switch
on the mri, she's dead.

865
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:09,634
X-ray her brain.

866
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,567
<i>(House)
pins.</i>

867
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:16,167
Push them rough the soft
foanelle of an infant,

868
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:17,968
you skewer the bin,
and the hair hides

869
00:39:18,034 --> 00:39:19,734
the entry wounds.

870
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:21,701
It's the perfect crime.

871
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,167
She's had them in her
all these years.

872
00:39:23,233 --> 00:39:24,400
What changed
at the temple?

873
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:26,500
Same thing that changed
in the mri.

874
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:29,100
(house)
shockingly, not all
religious leaders are honest.

875
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,801
I'm guessing
these particular monks

876
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,068
are bilking the faithful

877
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:33,500
by pushing a magnet
up buddha's butt.

878
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,001
There's another one
under the table

879
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:37,434
that'll repel or attract,
depending on how youhift them.

880
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,934
When she picked up
that magnet,

881
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,567
it med one of the pins deeper

882
00:39:40,634 --> 00:39:42,267
into the sympathetic
nervous center of her brain.

883
00:39:42,334 --> 00:39:44,133
This sent a signal
through the nerves

884
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,601
to the blood vessels
in her small intestines,

885
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,267
whiccaused the symptoms
in china

886
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:50,901
and in the giant magnet
we call an m.

887
00:39:50,934 --> 00:39:53,934
She'lucky.

888
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:56,133
We're all screwed up
by o parents.

889
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,734
She's got documentation.

890
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:03,801
The pins will be
removed surgically,

891
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,300
and she'll be fine.

892
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:07,968
We'll wake her from the coma
after the operation.

893
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:10,133
Is there any way
you could not tell her?

894
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,001
Please.

895
00:40:12,068 --> 00:40:14,133
She's fragile.

896
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,500
She desperately wanted
to know her biological parents.

897
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,834
For her to find out
that they wanted her dead...

898
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:22,767
I don't know what
that'll do to he

899
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:24,267
she may not be as fragile
as you think.

900
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:26,467
We know our daughter.

901
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:29,667
See this pin here?

902
00:40:29,734 --> 00:40:33,068
It's been pressing directly
on her addiction cter.

903
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:34,667
It's not her fault.

904
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:36,068
And it's definitely
not your fault.

905
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,267
She's not
who you think she is.

906
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:52,200
[knocking]

907
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:58,434
I hear your paent's
gonna be all right.

908
00:41:00,901 --> 00:41:03,100
Is that why you're here?

909
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:06,068
A colleague checking up
on a patient?

910
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:09,467
Something in' on?

911
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:12,701
I'm celebrating.

912
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:21,300
My mom hated him too.

913
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:26,167
Your dna test showed no match?
That's incredible.

914
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,801
<i>At the age of 12,</i>

915
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,867
you actually figured out
your father wasn't

916
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:32,233
<i>your birth fathe</i>

917
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,467
that's what you wanted,
wasn't it?

918
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:35,601
Why should it depress you?

919
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,634
It doesn't depress me.

920
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:40,133
<i>Doesn't make
any difference at all.</i>

921
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,334
That's what depresses me.

922
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,434
Well, I gues
nobody gets to choose

923
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,001
who their parents are.

924
00:41:51,068 --> 00:41:53,367
[inhales deeply]

925
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:55,968
i'm not even sure anymore
if we get to choose

926
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:57,367
who our friends are.

927
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:04,667
I spoke with cuddy.

928
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:06,001
She hasn't filled
my positioyet.

929
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:09,467
If you're coming back

930
00:42:09,534 --> 00:42:13,767
just because you're attracted
to the shine of my neediness...

931
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:16,200
I'd be okay with that.

932
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:24,167
I'm coming back
because you're right.

933
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:27,200
That strge, annoying trip
we just took

934
00:42:27,267 --> 00:42:29,367
was the most fun I've had
since amber died.

935
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:34,567
You hungry?

936
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:45,667
Wilson.

937
00:42:45,734 --> 00:42:47,233
Yeah?

938
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:52,367
My dad's dead.

939
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:56,267
Yeah.

940
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:57,400
My sympathies.
