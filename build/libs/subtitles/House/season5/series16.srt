1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:03,668
I want to reassure you,

2
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:06,905
your child can have
a completely normal life.

3
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:11,676
How can a baby have
male and female DNA?

4
00:00:11,744 --> 00:00:15,280
It's a condition called
genetic mosaicism.

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:20,218
The ambiguous genitalia
can be surgically repaired.

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,620
Repaired?

7
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:24,656
Made to look more...typical.

8
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,792
More typical?

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,294
But you haven't even told us

10
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,631
if the baby's a boy
or a girl.

11
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,032
That's...

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,007
that's a choice you
have to make.

13
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,676
Nice job, Jackson!

14
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:45,877
<i>Whoo!</i>

15
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:50,649
Take it.

16
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:00,825
He had the shot.

17
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:03,061
<i>He lost his nerve.</i>

18
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,029
Honey, it's okay.
He's doing great.

19
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,901
Three.

20
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:31,056
No fear that time.

21
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:35,360
Whoo!

22
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,668
Melanie.

23
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,503
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

24
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:47,372
Jackson!

25
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,384
Black heels or the boots?

26
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,655
You know I'm a fan
of those heels.

27
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:43,161
Boots it is.

28
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,295
For all we know,

29
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:46,831
House knows you're a fan
of those heels.

30
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:48,266
You think House
is gonna figure out

31
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,567
we faked our break-up
because of your shoes?

32
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,005
Go with the boots.

33
00:02:57,476 --> 00:02:59,044
Gonna eat that?

34
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:02,180
Have at it.

35
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,081
Did you just ask
my permission

36
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,983
before you took my food?

37
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,286
Yes, we can.

38
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,454
Adolescent genetic mosaicism.

39
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,689
Collapsed during
a basketball game.

40
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:11,890
Presenting with persistent
pelvic pain.

41
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:14,859
Fun.

42
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:16,027
The parents haven't told
their son

43
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,262
that he could've been
their daughter.

44
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,463
They want assurance
that you won't either.

45
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,899
Less fun, but still.

46
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:31,342
That was easy.

47
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,478
Our new patient.

48
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,280
Part girl,

49
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:37,015
part boy.

50
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,284
All 13's dream date.

51
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:42,053
Severe pelvic pain

52
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,121
<i>started during</i>
<i>a basketball game.</i>

53
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,556
Could be dehydration.

54
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:46,257
ER gave him fluids
when he came in.

55
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,159
<i>Still it feels chronic.</i>

56
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,461
We've got a kid
who could mate with himself,

57
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:50,762
and we think he didn't have
enough to drink?

58
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,797
<i>There are dozens</i>
<i>of intersex disorders.</i>

59
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,133
<i>Persistent pelvic pain</i>
<i>could mean</i>

60
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,134
<i>congenital adrenal hyperplasia,</i>

61
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,969
PMDS--

62
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,171
Those conditions occur
in intersex kids

63
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,406
<i>who are chromosomally</i>
<i>XX</i> or <i>XY.</i>

64
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,540
<i>Not XX</i> and <i>XY.</i>

65
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,042
<i>Parents recently started him</i>

66
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,577
on testosterone.
Maybe there's some--

67
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:08,179
Vitamins wouldn't cause
pelvic pain.

68
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,349
There's a note in here.

69
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,584
We're supposed to refer

70
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:13,985
to his testosterone shots
as vitamins.

71
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,854
<i>His parents aren't just liars.</i>

72
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,422
they want us to be liars too.

73
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,790
I won't do it.

74
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,925
You guys will, though.

75
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,293
<i>He's a kid.</i>

76
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,628
Parents don't think
he's ready to deal with it.

77
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,096
<i>My dad was the same way</i>
<i>about me</i>

78
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,865
maybe having Huntington's.

79
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:29,200
Well, that was your experience.

80
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,869
It should surely apply
in this situation.

81
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:33,605
Pain could be caused

82
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:35,673
by a blind uterus
hidden in his abdomen.

83
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:37,308
He needs an MRI.

84
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:39,077
<i> Right.</i>
<i>Boy with girl genes.</i>

85
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,780
I'm sure you're the first doctor
brilliant enough

86
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,014
<i>to check for a uterus.</i>

87
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,382
<i>He could have complications</i>

88
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,283
<i>from the surgeries</i>
<i>on his penis.</i>

89
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,551
That can cause pelvic pain.

90
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,986
Way to multi-task.

91
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:49,287
Impress your boss

92
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,322
<i>and humiliate your Ex.</i>

93
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,191
MRI is a waste of time.

94
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,926
To continue the humiliation,

95
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,594
you'll put a camera
up his penis.

96
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,332
<i> You're Dr. House,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,401
What do you think's wrong
with our son?

98
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,639
These people were just coming
to tell you.

99
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:09,574
This is better.

100
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,210
Don't have to worry
about them losing their way.

101
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,846
We think that he has
a blind uterus.

102
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,247
He should have an MRI.

103
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,449
Did you send 'em a text?

104
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,084
<i>Over the past 13 years,</i>

105
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,452
we've educated ourselves.

106
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,189
Who needs med school
when you got Wi-Fi?

107
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:28,259
Let's schedule their son
for an MRI with contrast

108
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,195
<i>right away.</i>

109
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:31,429
Thank you.
- Thanks.

110
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,000
You said an MRI
was a waste of time.

111
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,268
So is arguing with them.

112
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,774
<i>Contrast's in.</i>

113
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,375
Jackson,
we're gonna get started,

114
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:49,047
so try to lie still.

115
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,381
How long do you think

116
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:53,184
the post-break-up awkwardness
is gonna last?

117
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,554
Foreman and I are both
professionals.

118
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,289
Stomach and liver are clear.

119
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,258
If by professional you mean

120
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,194
he's a T-1000 build
by cyberdyne systems.

121
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,662
I never understood what
you saw in him.

122
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,432
He's not really your type, huh?

123
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,133
Moving down through
the pelvic floor.

124
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,902
Here's my impression
of Foreman

125
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:16,241
on the happiest day
of his life.

126
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:19,510
Now the saddest day
of his life.

127
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:21,880
We just broke up.

128
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:24,782
I'm not quite ready
to mock him yet.

129
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,218
House was a jerk
to split you two up.

130
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:31,356
But, bottom line,
he did you a favor.

131
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,524
Area around the intestinal tract
is clear.

132
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:38,930
No blind uterus.

133
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,403
I think there's something wrong
with House.

134
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,306
Who's he making miserable now?

135
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,674
Actually no one.

136
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,809
He okay'd an MRI
just because the parents

137
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:53,778
wanted to look
for a blind uterus.

138
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,647
There was no fighting,
no arguing.

139
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:56,848
He just went along.

140
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,916
It's a valid medical theory.

141
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:00,752
He doesn't think it is.

142
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,888
House decided to humor
these parents.

143
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:07,425
Maybe he had
a great cup of coffee.

144
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,060
Or a tremendous bowel movement.

145
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,163
Bottom line is your boss
is in a good mood.

146
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,465
Stop analyzing it
and just enjoy it.

147
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,741
We're gonna use this scope

148
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:25,143
to fill your bladder
with saline.

149
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,879
Then examine your urethra
for any narrow spots.

150
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,014
Why would there be
a narrow spot?

151
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:34,419
Sometimes it just happens.

152
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,087
Can my parents come in?

153
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,023
Sure.

154
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,225
I thought it'd be awkward
for you having them here.

155
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:42,794
I have this feeling

156
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,263
they've seen me naked before.

157
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,967
Now take a breath.
Just try to relax.

158
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,038
Mom.

159
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:58,209
It's okay, honey.

160
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,611
It's okay.

161
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:03,848
Hey, remember those sprints
they made you run in practice?

162
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,417
Those were so hard.

163
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:09,887
But you pulled through.

164
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:13,624
You can do this too.

165
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,159
I'm to the bladder.

166
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:16,060
Start the saline.

167
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,768
I'm gonna look around
and pull back on the scope.

168
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,538
Feels tight.

169
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:28,806
<i>That pressure's normal.</i>

170
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,141
Just try to hold on
for a few more minutes.

171
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,178
It's not down there.

172
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:35,546
<i>It's my chest.</i>

173
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,783
<i>Can't breathe.</i>

174
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,984
Can't bre--

175
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,853
<i>can't breathe.</i>

176
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,654
Is he okay?

177
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,056
Muffled heart sounds.

178
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,157
Jugular's distended.

179
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,592
Pericardial effusion.

180
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,860
We need ten gauge
on a syringe.

181
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:50,028
<i>What's happening?</i>

182
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,362
His heart is filling
with exudate.

183
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,898
If we don't drain it,
it'll stop beating.

184
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,034
We drained the fluid
from his pericardial space.

185
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:02,135
His heart rate is back
to normal.

186
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:03,870
Pelvis plus heart.

187
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:05,071
Doesn't fit with any
of the syndromes

188
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,907
associated with mosaicism.

189
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:08,809
<i> Could be drugs, toxins,</i>
<i>an infection.</i>

190
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:10,911
You're okay with this?

191
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:12,112
With what?

192
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,214
That we're considering
a diagnosis unrelated

193
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:15,415
to this kid being a shemale.

194
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:17,350
<i>Assuming a coincidence</i>

195
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:18,952
like that would usually
torture you

196
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,187
but you're completely unfazed.

197
00:09:20,254 --> 00:09:21,755
<i>Completely</i> unfazed?

198
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:23,190
<i>You think I'm totally lacking</i>

199
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:24,724
in any fazing?

200
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,060
The idea that I'm anything less
than half-fazed

201
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:28,962
I actually find offensive.

202
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,397
It greatly fazes me.

203
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:31,398
He started testosterone--

204
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:32,732
Vitamins.

205
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,334
A few months ago.

206
00:09:34,402 --> 00:09:35,802
That can cause autoimmune
diseases

207
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,637
<i>like polyarteritis</i>
<i>and SLE</i>

208
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,773
<i>which can cause</i>
<i>pericardial effusion</i>

209
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,141
and pelvic pain.

210
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:42,108
So it is related.

211
00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:46,346
Now I'm unfazed.

212
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:48,949
Start him on corticosteroids
for the autoimmune.

213
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,951
Finasteride to block
the vitamins.

214
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:01,361
You slept with House.

215
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:03,129
He asked permission
before taking my bagel.

216
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:05,799
Took the case without a fight.

217
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:08,201
Honored the parents' request
for an MRI.

218
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:10,170
Yes, those were my terms
for sleeping with him.

219
00:10:10,238 --> 00:10:11,705
He's in a good mood.

220
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:14,107
Sex with me would explain that.

221
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:15,842
But it doesn't explain

222
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,912
why I'm not curled up
in a ball weeping in shame.

223
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,947
I did not have sex with House.

224
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:23,550
If you two aren't keeping
something from me,

225
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:26,486
that means he's keeping
something from both of us.

226
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:27,921
That can't be good.

227
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:29,155
Or he's just in a good mood.

228
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:30,590
This is not a crisis.

229
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:33,360
Maybe you can get back
some of that money he owes you.

230
00:10:36,464 --> 00:10:38,598
Hmm.

231
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:43,270
Testosterone blocker?

232
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:46,606
Does that mean if Jackson
has SLE

233
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:47,941
or whatever
that other thing was,

234
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,110
that he'd had to go off
the hormones?

235
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:51,745
Probably.

236
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,047
Then Jackson'll stop
developing.

237
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:56,049
He'll never go through puberty.

238
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:58,485
Maybe this isn't what's wrong
with him.

239
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:00,220
Maybe the testosterone
didn't cause it.

240
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:03,623
Yeah, but if it is,
then he'll never be a man.

241
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:06,660
Did we make the wrong choice?

242
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:16,269
You'll need to tell him
the testosterone blocker

243
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:20,173
is something else.

244
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:21,608
Or maybe this is
a good opportunity

245
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,543
to tell him the truth.

246
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:25,345
It might make it simpler.

247
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:27,280
For all of you.

248
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:31,618
You want us to tell
a sick adolescent boy

249
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:33,753
that he's really not
an adolescent boy?

250
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:36,089
That...doesn't
seem simpler to me.

251
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:39,826
No.

252
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:43,163
Just...

253
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,131
give him the meds.

254
00:11:47,802 --> 00:11:49,369
So you have pain

255
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:52,339
in one arm and both your legs.

256
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:54,074
does it hurt right now?

257
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:55,809
No.

258
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:58,611
It's when I, like,
put pressure on them.

259
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,880
See...

260
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:03,850
it hurts when I do this.

261
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:04,884
Ow.

262
00:12:04,952 --> 00:12:08,321
And this.

263
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:10,657
Ow.

264
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:13,593
And this.

265
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:15,028
Ow.

266
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:17,964
What about this?

267
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:20,834
Aah!

268
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:23,670
Ow!

269
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:27,207
Did you give House the moron
with the broken finger?

270
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:29,142
They've been in room two
about ten minutes.

271
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,078
Patient should've been screaming
for another doctor

272
00:12:32,146 --> 00:12:34,447
seven minutes ago.

273
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:39,853
Thanks, Brah.

274
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:54,234
If I have this IV,
why do I need a shot too?

275
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,871
Just some extra medicine.

276
00:12:57,938 --> 00:13:01,107
Just to be safe.

277
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:03,109
I hear you're quite
the basketball player.

278
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:04,177
What position?

279
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:05,845
Point guard.

280
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:06,913
Small forward.

281
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:08,248
How's your crossover dribble?

282
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:10,083
It's okay.

283
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:11,718
Not really that into basketball.

284
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:14,120
Gonna feel a little pinch,
okay?

285
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:20,360
So if you're not that into it,
why did you join the team?

286
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:24,330
My mom kind of made me do it.

287
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:26,132
My parents were the same way.

288
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,268
Always pushing me
to try new things.

289
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:32,238
It's more like what
she didn't want me to try.

290
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:34,641
I--I wanted to take dance.

291
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,643
She flipped out
and made me choose

292
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,411
between basketball and hockey.

293
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:41,147
What does your dad say?

294
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:43,416
He seemed okay with it.

295
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:45,151
Then he just caved in
to my mom.

296
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:50,256
Your palm is red.

297
00:13:50,324 --> 00:13:52,792
What does that mean?

298
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,529
That we still don't know
what's wrong with you.

299
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,903
You were right.

300
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:06,072
He <i>is</i> in a good mood.

301
00:14:13,314 --> 00:14:15,515
Bummer it didn't work out
with you and Thirteen.

302
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,117
It happens.

303
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:18,518
You guys seemed happy together.

304
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:19,953
It's probably for the best.

305
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,754
You know, the bisexual thing
and all.

306
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:22,822
It was never an issue.

307
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,090
No, it never is.

308
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:25,692
Until it is.

309
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,193
This is Thirteen.

310
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:28,328
Before you guys
got together,

311
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:29,696
she was hooking up
with a different girl

312
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:31,364
every night.

313
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:32,665
Long term, you really think

314
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:37,504
you could compete with that?

315
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:40,106
House, wake up.
We have to talk.

316
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:42,041
Stop pretending to be asleep.
We're not leaving.

317
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:46,412
House.

318
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,048
What's going on?

319
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:50,416
House.

320
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:54,387
<i>He's not breathing.</i>
Can you get a pulse?

321
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:56,422
Barely.
Call a Code.

322
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,891
<i> Get an ambu bag</i>
<i>from the nurse's station.</i>

323
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,759
Heart still working means
synapses are still firing.

324
00:14:59,827 --> 00:15:03,329
We just need to get
a message through.

325
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:04,831
Aah!

326
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:11,838
You stopped breathing.

327
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:14,274
What the hell is going on?

328
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:23,794
I think my penis
stopped breathing.

329
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:24,895
Do you know CPR?

330
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:26,463
Looks like your brain
is okay.

331
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:28,599
Pupils are equal, round,
and reactive.

332
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,301
I'm fine.

333
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:31,402
Other than the fact

334
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,837
that my nurple is now purple.

335
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:35,105
No wonder you broke up
with him.

336
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:36,340
I'm surprised yours
are still attached.

337
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:37,775
<i>By the way,</i>

338
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:39,310
I could see that from here.

339
00:15:39,377 --> 00:15:42,713
I assume those are
our patient's lab results.

340
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:44,148
The patient can wait.
You could've died.

341
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:45,582
The only reason you'd ignore

342
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,051
<i>a near-death experience</i>

343
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:48,285
is you don't care

344
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:49,553
or you already know
why it happened.

345
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:50,988
It's called Vicodin.

346
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:53,123
I took too many.

347
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:54,325
Can I please
get some information

348
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:55,526
about our patient?

349
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:56,827
Patient's palms are red.

350
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:58,929
Lab tests confirmed liver
and kidney dysfunction.

351
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:00,597
I don't remember you taking
any Vicodin today.

352
00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:02,166
I don't remember hiring
my mother.

353
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,234
<i>What causes the enzymes</i>

354
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,303
in little boy George's
existing heart problem

355
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:07,738
<i>and pelvic pain?</i>

356
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:09,773
You didn't take any yesterday
at breakfast either.

357
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:11,875
I don't remember having
breakfast with my mother.

358
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:14,044
Amyloidosis
with systemic involvement.

359
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:15,713
<i>Protein levels are normal.</i>

360
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,047
This kid's depressed.

361
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:18,549
If he's self-medicating
with drugs and alcohol,

362
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:19,917
that'd explain his symptoms.

363
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:21,885
Search the school.
Search the home.

364
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:23,253
Seriously?
Or are you just deflecting?

365
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:25,122
Both.

366
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:29,393
Where are you going?

367
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:30,794
Nowhere.

368
00:16:30,862 --> 00:16:32,596
I'm staying right here.
So we can properly discuss this.

369
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:37,968
He's on heroin.

370
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:39,203
How can you--

371
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,471
Number one--

372
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:42,606
He's happy,
which means he's high.

373
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:44,007
Number two--
when he moved his bad leg,

374
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:45,809
he didn't use his hands
to support it.

375
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:47,010
Whatever he's taking,

376
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:49,346
it's stronger than Vicodin.

377
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:50,848
What are we gonna do?

378
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:57,221
You really think House
took too many Vicodin?

379
00:16:57,288 --> 00:16:59,156
Guy pops 'em like candy.

380
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:02,059
I'm surprised it hasn't happened
before.

381
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:03,427
You miss sleeping with women?

382
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:05,729
Excuse me?

383
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:07,064
Simple question.

384
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:09,666
Yes.

385
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:10,934
It's a simple answer.

386
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:13,837
I'll...check under the bed.

387
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:19,610
I also miss sleeping
with other men.

388
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:22,279
And I'm sure you miss sleeping
with other women.

389
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:24,948
<i>Monogamy is like saying</i>

390
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:26,383
you're never gonna have

391
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:28,552
any other ice cream flavor
besides rocky road.

392
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,487
<i>So you're saying</i>

393
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:32,890
if you don't have pink bubblegum
for a while,

394
00:17:32,957 --> 00:17:35,025
that one day you're gonna
chase down the ice cream truck?

395
00:17:35,093 --> 00:17:36,727
No.

396
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:38,595
Rocky road is great.

397
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:44,601
It's a very delicious
and complicated flavor.

398
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:46,103
I also know that if I have
other flavors,

399
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:47,671
then rocky road is gonna be left
in the freezer

400
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:49,540
where anyone can just dip in.

401
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:54,144
Can we please drop
the metaphor?

402
00:17:54,212 --> 00:17:56,313
<i>Why is this coming up now?</i>

403
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:59,249
Kutner said the silver lining
of our break-up

404
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:01,051
was I wouldn't be dumped
for a girl.

405
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:03,086
<i>There's nothing in here either.</i>

406
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:04,421
Seems like you're wrong

407
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:05,789
about this kid having drug
or alcohol--

408
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:06,790
When did he bring that up?

409
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:08,692
Earlier today.

410
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,893
<i>Right before--</i>

411
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:10,961
This morning Taub called you
a robot.

412
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:13,564
Huh.

413
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,433
Either it's a big coincidence
or...

414
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:17,801
they're jerking us around.

415
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:18,802
They know.

416
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,938
And if they know,

417
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:22,339
<i>House knows.</i>

418
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:23,907
This is bad.

419
00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:25,742
No.

420
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,378
This is good.

421
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:31,582
House only has two ways
to handle us still going out.

422
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:33,150
He jerks us around
or he fires us.

423
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:35,018
He chose option A.

424
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:36,553
This is good.

425
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:45,929
But this is bad.

426
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:48,131
"I stand alone,
my soul and me,

427
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:51,235
beneath the mask
that others...see."

428
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:56,006
His chest is still rising.

429
00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:57,341
He's just screwing with me

430
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:59,810
'cause Cuddy made me babysit.

431
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:02,112
"A pain that tears
and bites

432
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,413
"and will not bend.

433
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:05,249
Only when I sleep
will it end."

434
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:07,551
Downer.

435
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:13,490
You sure his chest is moving?

436
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:15,025
House.

437
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:16,627
If he's faking, you think
he's gonna come clean

438
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:18,495
'cause you said his name?

439
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:19,563
Back off.

440
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:21,532
<i>Only Thirteen gets</i>

441
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,267
to grab my nipples
this time.

442
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:25,235
You know, recreating the moment
when you made us

443
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:28,305
crap our pants isn't actually
all that funny.

444
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:29,740
That is sweet that

445
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:32,910
you're worried about House.

446
00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:36,613
<i>Unless the next stanza reads</i>

447
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:38,015
"Hing to fry my brain
to death,

448
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:41,151
I smoked some primo
crystal meth,"

449
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:42,619
I'm not interested.

450
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:44,288
You can't deny that this kid
may be suicidal.

451
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:45,522
We're not here
to make him happy.

452
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,690
We're here to diagnose him.

453
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:47,891
It's an infection.

454
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,593
<i>Swab of the kid's water bottle</i>

455
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:50,561
turned up toxoplasmosis.

456
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:53,864
I'll start him on pyrimethamine.

457
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:05,576
I had no idea he felt
this way.

458
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:08,879
Is there a therapist here
that you can recommend?

459
00:20:08,947 --> 00:20:10,981
It might help more
if you talked to him.

460
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:14,184
He's not ready.

461
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:15,719
If telling him the truth

462
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:17,220
would help him stop feeling
like this--

463
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:19,423
If I knew that it would make him
less confused,

464
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,624
I'd tell him right now.

465
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:23,460
<i>But if she's wrong,</i>

466
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:24,828
we'd only make things worse.

467
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:28,565
He obviously senses
he's different.

468
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:30,567
He's looking for answers.

469
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:33,370
Every teenager
feels different.

470
00:20:33,438 --> 00:20:36,306
He's sick.

471
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:38,141
This isn't the time
to spring this on him.

472
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,980
Okay.

473
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:47,451
When you give Jackson
the antibiotics,

474
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:49,886
will you please restart
the testosterone?

475
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:50,988
Sure.

476
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,227
I get House wanting
to jerk me and Thirteen around,

477
00:20:57,295 --> 00:20:58,395
but you guys?

478
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:01,999
Told you they were still
together.

479
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:03,634
How do you know?

480
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:05,836
Noticed you smell like
Thirteen's soap every morning.

481
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:07,571
You figured it out?

482
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:09,239
Yes, I'm a little slow.

483
00:21:09,307 --> 00:21:10,574
Maybe someone should
let me know

484
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:11,608
when I should be insulted.

485
00:21:11,676 --> 00:21:14,211
Then House doesn't know.

486
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:15,946
Probably does now
that you felt her up

487
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:20,651
during that last differential.

488
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:23,186
You noticed this
but House didn't?

489
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:24,721
Yes, I get it.

490
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,623
He's generally smarter than me.

491
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:27,958
Can we please move on?

492
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:28,859
He's not generally smarter
than you.

493
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:31,395
He's always smarter than you.

494
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:34,331
Unless...

495
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:39,336
Hello.

496
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:41,238
House is on heroin.

497
00:21:44,242 --> 00:21:47,244
Well, that's certainly
an...interesting notion.

498
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:48,745
It's why his lungs stopped.

499
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:50,047
It's why he okay'd
the MRI.

500
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:51,415
It's why he missed...

501
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:54,351
things he wouldn't
ordinarily miss.

502
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,720
Um, we'll run some tests

503
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:58,188
and I'll let you know.

504
00:21:58,256 --> 00:21:59,289
<i>He's there, isn't he?</i>

505
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:00,157
Well, that would certainly
explain

506
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:01,258
the inappropriate responses.

507
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:03,126
I--I gotta go.

508
00:22:03,194 --> 00:22:05,062
Okay.

509
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:06,730
Sorry.
A consult.

510
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,199
When did you order these?

511
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:10,767
When you were in the bathroom.

512
00:22:10,835 --> 00:22:14,337
I thought a celebration
was in order.

513
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:15,806
To cheating death.

514
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:25,348
You off bourbon?

515
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,550
We can get you something else.

516
00:22:26,617 --> 00:22:28,118
I came here expecting
a burger.

517
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:29,853
Figured I'd have to endure

518
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:31,555
a little lecture
on moderation.

519
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:34,057
You never listen,
so why--

520
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,325
Instead, I get a drink.

521
00:22:35,393 --> 00:22:37,160
Nice little serving

522
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:38,895
of respiratory depressant

523
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:40,564
on the day that my lungs
stopped working.

524
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:42,265
You seem fine now.

525
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,534
You don't believe
that I OD'd on Vicodin.

526
00:22:44,602 --> 00:22:46,670
<i>You figure I'm on something</i>
<i>stronger.</i>

527
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:48,972
And because you can never,
ever assume anything

528
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,540
but the most screwed-up
scenarios,

529
00:22:50,608 --> 00:22:51,575
as far as I'm concerned--

530
00:22:51,642 --> 00:22:53,076
Funny how I'm usually right.

531
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:55,812
You think that I'm on heroin.

532
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,714
<i>This is your version</i>
<i>of a tox screen.</i>

533
00:22:57,782 --> 00:22:59,416
Because if I am on heroin,

534
00:22:59,484 --> 00:23:01,451
I can't drink that
without risking

535
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,554
another bout
of not breathing.

536
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:08,558
Well?

537
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:20,370
Good night.

538
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:28,612
<i>Another shot?</i>

539
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,514
I'm afraid so.

540
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:34,151
That looks like the vitamins
my parents give me.

541
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:37,854
Same red top.

542
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:48,832
These aren't vitamins.

543
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,167
What is it?

544
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:52,702
I can't tell you that.

545
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,870
You should ask your parents.

546
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:02,012
<i>You idiot!</i>

547
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,484
Okay, I admit it.

548
00:24:07,552 --> 00:24:09,886
I have bulimia.

549
00:24:09,954 --> 00:24:10,921
I look good though,
don't I?

550
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:12,022
Heroin.

551
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:13,557
Heroin!

552
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:15,692
House, of all the stupid--

553
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,928
I'm not on heroin.

554
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:19,830
I just caught you with
your fingers down your throat.

555
00:24:19,897 --> 00:24:20,897
I'm on methadone.

556
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:25,969
Stupid product.

557
00:24:26,037 --> 00:24:27,437
Heroin without the high.

558
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:30,273
Yeah, and twice the risk
of death.

559
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:31,474
But no risk of arrest.

560
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:32,776
You nearly died.

561
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:34,211
Today was a fluke.
I nodded off.

562
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:35,278
<i>Right.</i>

563
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:36,713
You're safe as long
as you

564
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:38,315
<i>never sleep again.</i>

565
00:24:38,382 --> 00:24:39,416
<i>Mistime your dose,</i>

566
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:40,517
you die.

567
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:41,484
Couple of drinks,
you die.

568
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:42,752
Mix it with the wrong drugs,

569
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,987
<i>you die.</i>

570
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:45,188
<i>You want to detox</i>
<i>from Vicodin?</i>

571
00:24:45,256 --> 00:24:46,890
Pick something that won't
kill you.

572
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:47,924
I'm not detoxing.

573
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:51,595
If you're looking
for something

574
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:53,063
to help with your pain--

575
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,265
Doesn't help my pain.

576
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,901
It eliminates it.

577
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:09,713
My leg doesn't hurt anymore.

578
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:22,660
<i>She completely disregarded</i>
<i>our instructions.</i>

579
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:24,862
He asked a question.
I was tired of lying.

580
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,931
I didn't tell him anything
about his genetic condition.

581
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:29,333
I want her removed
from our son's case.

582
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:31,368
I'm sorry for the position

583
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:32,770
Dr. Hadley put you in,

584
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:35,372
but I can't do that.

585
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,740
<i>She's a valuable part</i>
<i>of Dr. House's</i>

586
00:25:36,808 --> 00:25:38,142
<i>diagnostic team.</i>

587
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,811
If he stays on the case,
so does she.

588
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:42,613
<i>We have to deal with Jackson.</i>

589
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:44,448
These questions
aren't gonna go away.

590
00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:46,483
He's not ready for this.

591
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,122
Let's hope you're wrong.

592
00:25:57,362 --> 00:25:59,196
I'm sorry. I'll stay away
from their son.

593
00:25:59,264 --> 00:26:01,365
No, you won't.

594
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,067
<i>In about 15 minutes,</i>

595
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:04,635
<i>you're the only person</i>
<i>that kid's gonna trust.</i>

596
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:06,370
If he needs a hand to hold,

597
00:26:06,438 --> 00:26:07,438
make sure yours
is available.

598
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:17,581
So what?

599
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:20,417
Am I a boy or a girl?

600
00:26:20,485 --> 00:26:23,454
Some of your cells are male...

601
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:24,521
and some are female.

602
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:26,523
So basically I'm a freak.

603
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:30,127
No, no, buddy.

604
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:31,528
You're just a little different.

605
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:37,067
You've known this...

606
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:38,902
Since I was born.

607
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,571
And you never told me.

608
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:42,339
We didn't want you
to be confused.

609
00:26:42,407 --> 00:26:43,707
So you lied to me.

610
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:45,876
Oh, please, sweetie,

611
00:26:45,944 --> 00:26:47,344
we were just trying
to protect you.

612
00:26:47,412 --> 00:26:49,947
Don't.

613
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:53,584
Just leave me alone.

614
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:55,519
Get out.

615
00:26:58,089 --> 00:26:59,256
Let's go.

616
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:14,305
<i>You still breathing in there?</i>

617
00:27:14,372 --> 00:27:15,806
<i>'Cause if not,</i>

618
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:18,742
<i>I'm sending in janitorial.</i>

619
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,943
I'm not breathing.

620
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:21,512
But it's strictly voluntary.

621
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:23,647
<i>Should've seen the guy</i>
<i>who was in here before me.</i>

622
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:24,882
I know about the methadone.

623
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:28,886
It's legal.

624
00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:30,621
<i>I have a prescription.</i>

625
00:27:30,689 --> 00:27:33,524
Whatever doctor you conned
into writing it

626
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:35,192
<i>clearly had no idea</i>
<i>about your addiction issues.</i>

627
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,660
<i>Your lack of--</i>
he knows I'm in pain.

628
00:27:36,728 --> 00:27:39,563
<i>What I put in my body</i>
<i>is my business.</i>

629
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:42,066
You keep taking this,
you could die.

630
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:43,701
If you'd said that
if I keep doing this

631
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:45,469
<i>you</i> could die,
then it'd be your business.

632
00:27:47,772 --> 00:27:50,274
I can't sit by and watch you
kill yourself.

633
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:51,909
<i>As long as you're</i>
<i>in my hospital,</i>

634
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:53,110
You can't do methadone.

635
00:28:01,986 --> 00:28:03,287
I'll send someone
for my stuff.

636
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:07,424
That's it?

637
00:28:07,492 --> 00:28:09,693
<i>You're quitting?</i>

638
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:11,962
You're choosing methadone
over this job?

639
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,532
I'm choosing lack of pain
over this job.

640
00:28:25,777 --> 00:28:28,545
Eventually you have to talk
to your parents again.

641
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:31,014
No, I don't.

642
00:28:41,426 --> 00:28:43,694
I have this one friend.

643
00:28:43,762 --> 00:28:45,529
He's on my basketball team.
Will.

644
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:48,799
We hang out a lot.

645
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:50,300
I really like him.

646
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:53,637
Now I'm worried that I...

647
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:56,039
you know, <i>like</i> him.

648
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,912
Maybe I'm supposed to.

649
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,350
Because if I'm really a girl...

650
00:29:06,418 --> 00:29:09,052
Hmm.

651
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,921
Do you feel like a girl?

652
00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:15,025
I like dancing
more than basketball.

653
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:18,328
Is that what that means?

654
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:26,203
Jackson...

655
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:28,906
As hard as it is right now,

656
00:29:28,973 --> 00:29:30,774
at least it's out
in the open.

657
00:29:30,842 --> 00:29:35,546
You don't have to hide
behind a mask.

658
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:42,152
I found the poem you wrote
in your room.

659
00:29:45,924 --> 00:29:47,691
No matter how bad things get,

660
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,428
killing yourself
is never the answer.

661
00:29:57,836 --> 00:29:59,736
This was an English assignment.

662
00:30:02,841 --> 00:30:04,174
We were supposed to write
a poem

663
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:06,376
in the style of Sylvia Plath.

664
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:15,519
You don't feel this way?

665
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:19,356
I'm sad sometimes.

666
00:30:19,424 --> 00:30:21,792
I don't want to die.

667
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,428
At least, I didn't.

668
00:30:33,972 --> 00:30:36,907
Are these antibiotics
supposed to make you nauseous?

669
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:40,410
Yeah, they can.

670
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:05,836
# lifting me up
like a garage door #

671
00:31:05,904 --> 00:31:09,006
# I need to feel it when
the drug starts coming on #

672
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:12,009
# I know you, lord,
are a jealous lord #

673
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:14,945
# I know the tablet
is your competition #

674
00:31:15,013 --> 00:31:18,315
# and I need-- # #

675
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:22,538
We're on our own.

676
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:23,606
Is he okay?

677
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,107
He's fine.
He's just not here.

678
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,475
Did he quit?
Did she suspend him?

679
00:31:26,543 --> 00:31:27,643
She didn't say.

680
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:28,644
She just told me
I was in charge

681
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,646
<i>until further notice.</i>

682
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:31,947
So if we add bloody vomit

683
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,349
to our patient's list
of symptoms.

684
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:35,251
Surgeon reports the bleeding
was caused

685
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,619
by a gastric fistula

686
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,020
caused by necrotizing
pancreatitis.

687
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:39,388
She must've told you something.

688
00:31:39,456 --> 00:31:40,890
Nothing that would help us
with this patient.

689
00:31:40,957 --> 00:31:43,092
Heart, liver, kidneys,
and pancreas.

690
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,193
Obviously whatever
this kid's got

691
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:46,662
is something systemic.

692
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,165
Zollinger-Ellison?

693
00:31:49,232 --> 00:31:51,133
Or systemic scleroderma.

694
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,035
Zollinger-Ellison fits better.

695
00:31:53,103 --> 00:31:54,036
Why?

696
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:55,104
Can we at least call House?

697
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:56,138
<i>We can.</i>

698
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,807
I have.
He's not answering.

699
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,709
<i>Put the patient</i>
<i>on proton pump inhibitors.</i>

700
00:31:59,776 --> 00:32:01,344
If he gets better,
it's Zollinger-Ellison.

701
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:03,045
If not, it's scleroderma.

702
00:32:08,985 --> 00:32:11,787
Zollinger-Ellison
doesn't fit better.

703
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:14,223
You don't want it
to be scleroderma

704
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:15,124
Because that means
he's gonna die.

705
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:17,159
Patients die all the time.

706
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,994
Not the ones whose family
you've ruined.

707
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,063
I don't think that.

708
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:23,733
You do.

709
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,000
It's not your fault.

710
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,370
He was no more confused
than any other teenager.

711
00:32:27,437 --> 00:32:29,672
Then I started a fire
and threw gas on it.

712
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,241
You were trying to help.

713
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:40,883
Hi, is House here?

714
00:32:40,951 --> 00:32:42,318
He's getting dressed.

715
00:32:42,386 --> 00:32:44,320
I'll be back around 10:00
tonight.

716
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,424
Go on in.

717
00:32:48,492 --> 00:32:49,458
Okay.

718
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,764
Who was she?

719
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:56,565
<i>I hired her to watch me sleep.</i>

720
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:58,267
<i>Make sure I don't stop</i>
<i>breathing.</i>

721
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:01,470
Home nurses usually wear scrubs.

722
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:03,706
<i>She's not a nurse.</i>

723
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:06,308
You hired a hooker
to watch you sleep?

724
00:33:06,376 --> 00:33:10,379
That just can't--

725
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,548
Surprisingly,
hookers are cheaper.

726
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,850
And they don't sue
for sexual harassment.

727
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:16,051
Which one?

728
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,221
You shaved.

729
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,489
The red one then.

730
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:22,825
You have <i>two</i> ties?

731
00:33:22,893 --> 00:33:25,428
Meeting at St. Sebastian's
today.

732
00:33:25,495 --> 00:33:27,196
<i>Gonna try and talk 'em</i>

733
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:29,064
into starting up
a diagnostics department.

734
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,733
Sounds great.

735
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,835
<i>I just came by</i>

736
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:34,136
to check up on you.

737
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:35,337
See how you were doing.

738
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:38,841
I'm fine.

739
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:41,544
I guess you are.

740
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:46,348
He hasn't responded
to the medication at all?

741
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:48,184
I'm afraid not.

742
00:33:48,251 --> 00:33:50,519
<i>So...</i>

743
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:52,054
That means he's got
the other thing?

744
00:33:52,122 --> 00:33:53,589
I'm so sorry.

745
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,559
We'll start him
on anti-inflammatories.

746
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:58,394
<i>If we're lucky,</i>

747
00:33:58,462 --> 00:34:00,863
that will slow down
the progression.

748
00:34:08,638 --> 00:34:10,840
My son has a death sentence

749
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:12,274
and I can't go in there
and be with him

750
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,309
because of you.

751
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,844
I'm sorry.

752
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:16,278
You find a homework assignment

753
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,913
and decide he's suicidal.

754
00:34:17,981 --> 00:34:20,883
Make it your own
personal mission.

755
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:21,951
I let my feelings--

756
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,919
Oh, don't you dare apologize.

757
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:25,754
Like it could absolve you

758
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:27,890
of what you've done to me,
my family.

759
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,625
He was fine.

760
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,694
<i>I understand why you're angry.</i>

761
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:33,963
But this isn't where
you belong right now.

762
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,297
He won't let us
in the room.

763
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,665
He's a teenager.

764
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:38,400
You're his mother.

765
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:40,503
This is not the time
to start listening to him.

766
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,706
Go be with him.

767
00:34:50,814 --> 00:34:54,950
Thank you.

768
00:34:55,018 --> 00:34:56,552
I didn't do it for you.

769
00:35:02,826 --> 00:35:04,460
We made a mistake.

770
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:05,761
No, we didn't.

771
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:07,396
The methadone's good for him.

772
00:35:07,464 --> 00:35:09,331
The methadone
is gonna kill him.

773
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,733
He shaved.

774
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,134
He was wearing a tie.

775
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:13,736
He has a meeting
at St. Sebastian.

776
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:15,371
If he buys
a new pair of shoes,

777
00:35:15,438 --> 00:35:17,072
should we let him smoke crack?

778
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,307
Cuddy, he's happy.

779
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:19,875
House doesn't do happy.

780
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:21,810
Pain or no pain.

781
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:25,114
Okay, maybe...

782
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:27,383
but he's our friend.

783
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,787
And this is his one chance
to not be miserable.

784
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,961
The heels.
Very nice.

785
00:35:58,029 --> 00:35:59,363
No reason not to wear them

786
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,198
now that House is gone.

787
00:36:01,266 --> 00:36:02,666
You okay?

788
00:36:02,734 --> 00:36:04,534
Yeah.
Just tired.

789
00:36:04,602 --> 00:36:06,236
Got some good news.

790
00:36:06,304 --> 00:36:07,871
Patient's scleroderma
is responding

791
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:09,172
to the anti-inflammatory meds.

792
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,807
His AST level's dropped
a bit.

793
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:14,444
So he's dying slightly
less quickly than we thought.

794
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:18,682
That's great news.

795
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,550
I'm not okay.

796
00:36:20,618 --> 00:36:22,686
Next time just say that.

797
00:36:26,424 --> 00:36:28,725
What's his AST?

798
00:36:28,793 --> 00:36:30,160
Uh...185, I think.

799
00:36:30,228 --> 00:36:32,029
That's a pretty fast drop.

800
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:33,230
Are we sure it's from
the anti-inflammatories?

801
00:36:33,298 --> 00:36:34,831
What else could it be from?

802
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:35,932
He's been off the antibiotics
for a while.

803
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,900
Proton pump inhibitor's--

804
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:38,302
He's back on testosterone.

805
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:39,903
Testosterone wouldn't help
his liver function.

806
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:41,738
But it could improve
his kidney function

807
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:43,540
which would also lower
his AST.

808
00:36:43,608 --> 00:36:45,609
But not in kidneys damaged
by scleroderma.

809
00:36:45,677 --> 00:36:48,845
Which means
it's not scleroderma.

810
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:56,219
I have an interview
in two hours.

811
00:36:56,287 --> 00:36:58,722
Wow.

812
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,158
Hand over my letter
of recommendation.

813
00:37:01,225 --> 00:37:03,060
Mm, sorry,
I haven't done it yet.

814
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:05,929
You have no right
to sabotage--

815
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:07,497
I was busy with this.

816
00:37:10,168 --> 00:37:12,369
It's a list of requirements
for your methadone treatment.

817
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:14,671
Weekly drug tests.

818
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:16,039
Supervised doses

819
00:37:16,107 --> 00:37:18,075
<i>administered on a precise</i>
<i>schedule by me</i>

820
00:37:18,142 --> 00:37:20,277
or one of the nurses.

821
00:37:20,345 --> 00:37:22,479
Seems weird
getting my meds here

822
00:37:22,547 --> 00:37:23,714
when I'm working somewhere else.

823
00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:27,351
Yes.

824
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:29,853
I'm offering you
your job back.

825
00:37:32,657 --> 00:37:33,623
I want a raise.

826
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:35,058
No.

827
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:37,794
And a bigger office...
but in the same spot.

828
00:37:37,862 --> 00:37:40,497
No.

829
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:44,501
We both know this is where
you belong.

830
00:37:47,705 --> 00:37:50,941
Okay.

831
00:37:51,008 --> 00:37:53,910
Welcome back.

832
00:37:59,217 --> 00:38:01,585
Thank you.

833
00:38:01,652 --> 00:38:03,854
You're welcome.

834
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,964
You okay?

835
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:17,167
I have issues with authority.
- You?

836
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:19,169
W-we thought you were gone.

837
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:20,737
Cuddy missed me.

838
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:21,905
And what happened
to your cane?

839
00:38:21,973 --> 00:38:24,541
She asked to borrow it
for some reason.

840
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:27,677
Patient dead or do I need
to do anything?

841
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:28,845
He's got scleroderma.

842
00:38:28,913 --> 00:38:30,914
It's not scleroderma.

843
00:38:30,982 --> 00:38:32,048
Wow.

844
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:34,184
Two days,
and you've already got

845
00:38:34,252 --> 00:38:35,819
two separate theories.

846
00:38:35,887 --> 00:38:38,321
You're back. Good.

847
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:39,790
We noticed a drop
in AST levels.

848
00:38:39,857 --> 00:38:41,758
<i>It's not from</i>
<i>the anti-inflammatory meds.</i>

849
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:43,293
It's because his kidneys got
better from the testosterone.

850
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:44,928
Which rules out scleroderma.

851
00:38:44,996 --> 00:38:47,431
When did you two come up
with this?

852
00:38:47,498 --> 00:38:49,533
We ran into each other
in the lobby.

853
00:38:52,637 --> 00:38:53,970
What did we miss?

854
00:38:54,038 --> 00:38:54,971
When I say "we"
I mean "you,"

855
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,006
Since I wasn't here.

856
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:57,541
We've ruled out
Zollinger-Ellison.

857
00:38:57,608 --> 00:38:59,142
That was a dumb idea.

858
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,143
Why?

859
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:01,244
Because it was wrong.

860
00:39:01,312 --> 00:39:02,345
<i>Also toxoplasmosis,</i>

861
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:03,613
dehydration,

862
00:39:03,681 --> 00:39:06,183
<i>SLE, various intersex</i>
<i>disorders.</i>

863
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,417
Oh, crap.

864
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:12,289
This kid like energy drinks?

865
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:14,424
I saw some empty bottles

866
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:16,993
<i>in the team locker room.</i>

867
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:17,928
But energy drinks
don't explain--

868
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:19,029
Nice work.

869
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:21,231
So...we're okay?

870
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:25,368
Why wouldn't we be?

871
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:26,770
<i>Nice heels.</i>

872
00:39:35,346 --> 00:39:36,279
This is all
your parents' fault.

873
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:38,048
Excuse me?

874
00:39:38,115 --> 00:39:39,716
Chug a lot of energy drinks

875
00:39:39,784 --> 00:39:42,652
before, during,
and after practice?

876
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,322
Your son came in here
with simple dehydration.

877
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:47,624
That's why he collapsed
during the game.

878
00:39:47,692 --> 00:39:48,959
The ER treated him for that.

879
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:50,060
<i>It didn't help the pain.</i>

880
00:39:50,127 --> 00:39:51,595
That's where the energy drinks
came in.

881
00:39:51,662 --> 00:39:53,230
They put a strain
on his kidneys

882
00:39:53,297 --> 00:39:54,364
so he needed more time
to rebound

883
00:39:54,432 --> 00:39:55,532
from the initial dehydration.

884
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,133
Then why isn't he better?

885
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:59,202
That's where your idiocy
came in.

886
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,005
<i>Before we could give him</i>
<i>another glass of water,</i>

887
00:40:02,073 --> 00:40:03,940
you two insisted I do an MRI.

888
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:07,043
<i>So I go down a blind alley</i>

889
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:08,879
looking for a blind uterus.

890
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:11,281
And my team injects him
with contrast material.

891
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:13,750
If his kidneys
had been healthy,

892
00:40:13,818 --> 00:40:14,851
they would've filtered out
the contrast

893
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:16,286
in a couple hours.

894
00:40:16,354 --> 00:40:18,822
Since they weren't,
they went around and around.

895
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,123
Eventually getting absorbed
by his heart,

896
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:21,525
his liver,
and his pancreas,

897
00:40:21,592 --> 00:40:23,493
getting in trouble
everywhere it went.

898
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:26,062
Your son was fine
when he got here.

899
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,232
It was your freaked-out
overprotectiveness

900
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,267
that nearly killed him.

901
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:32,435
Nearly?

902
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:34,104
He's young.

903
00:40:34,171 --> 00:40:36,306
<i>A few weeks of dialysis,</i>

904
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:39,743
<i>he should be fine.</i>

905
00:40:45,783 --> 00:40:48,351
You gave birth
to a freak of nature.

906
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:51,254
Doesn't mean it's a good idea
to treat him like one.

907
00:41:03,534 --> 00:41:05,468
How you feeling?

908
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,137
A little bit better.

909
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:09,773
I saw you talking
to your parents earlier.

910
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,141
That's good.

911
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,643
My mom asked if I wanted
to take dance lessons.

912
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:16,179
That's great.

913
00:41:16,247 --> 00:41:18,148
I'm actually worried
I might miss basketball.

914
00:41:18,215 --> 00:41:20,717
Starting to get good.

915
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:21,952
There's no reason
you can't do both.

916
00:41:43,174 --> 00:41:44,441
Starting tomorrow,

917
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:45,775
you'll come to my office
for your fix.

918
00:41:45,843 --> 00:41:50,013
I'm done with the methadone.

919
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:51,448
I screwed up.

920
00:41:51,515 --> 00:41:54,417
The kids' parents wanted
that MRI.

921
00:41:54,485 --> 00:41:55,585
I knew he didn't need it.

922
00:41:55,653 --> 00:41:57,153
I did it anyway.

923
00:41:57,221 --> 00:42:00,290
That's what got him sick.

924
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:02,292
You just solved a case
that no one else could solve.

925
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,094
I created a case.

926
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:08,098
I played nice because
I was in a good mood

927
00:42:08,165 --> 00:42:09,933
because I didn't hurt.

928
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:12,469
You don't need your pain
to be a good doctor.

929
00:42:12,536 --> 00:42:13,803
I'm not interested in good.

930
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:15,105
You're afraid to be happy.

931
00:42:15,172 --> 00:42:17,674
Why do you care
if I'm happy?

932
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:26,783
You're afraid of change.

933
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:29,319
The one thing you have
is your intellect.

934
00:42:29,387 --> 00:42:31,187
You think if that's compromised,
you have nothing.

935
00:42:37,361 --> 00:42:39,095
Just take it.

936
00:42:39,163 --> 00:42:41,031
No.

937
00:42:41,098 --> 00:42:42,532
Don't do this.

938
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,602
It's already done.

939
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:51,408
This is the only me you get.

940
00:43:04,588 --> 00:43:07,257
