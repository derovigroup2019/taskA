1
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
WOW.

2
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,500
YEAH.

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,100
COME BACK TO BED.

4
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,800
GIMME A MINUTE.

5
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,100
YOU GET 20 SECONDS.

6
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,300
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU-

7
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,300
FEMALE, LATE 20S,
TONIC CLONIC SEIZURE.

8
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,300
DURATION OF THE SEIZURE?

9
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,800
A LITTLE OVER THREE MINUTES.

10
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,500
DOES YOUR FRIEND HAVE
A HISTORY OF EPILEPSY?

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,600
SHE NEVER SAID.

12
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
MY NAME IS DR. CAMERON.
YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL.

13
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU.

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,400
<i>- WHAT'S HER NAME?

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,100
EH.

20
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,300
I HAVE A CASE I THINK
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN.

21
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,400
NOT NOW.

22
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,100
A 26-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
HAD A TONIC CLONIC SEIZURE.

23
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,700
WHAT ABOUT ME SPEEDING AWAY

24
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,500
SAYS TO YOU "LET'S CHAT"?

25
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,000
HISTORY OF FATIGUE,
AND TWO YEARS AGO

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,300
SHE HAD A RETINAL
VEIN OCCLUSION.

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,700
SHE'S DIABETIC.

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,600
NO, SHE'S NOT.

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000
AND SHE HAS NO HISTORY
OF HYPERTENSION.

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
IT CAN WAIT.

31
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,100
I KNEW I SHOULD'VE SET UP
A VIDEO CAMERA.

32
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,200
STAY THERE.

33
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,100
OH, MY GOODNESS.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,700
I PLAYED A PRACTICAL JOKE
ON MY BEST FRIEND,

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,600
AND HE'S BADLY INJURED.

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,500
I WISH I HAD LEARNED
THIS VALUABLE LESSON EARLIER.

37
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,100
<i>I WAS WAITING BY MY WINDOW
FOR AN HOUR.</i>

38
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,000
WHY ARE YOU LATE?

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,500
I HAD A BREAKFAST MEETING
AT MICKEY'S DINER

40
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,600
WITH THE MERCY PEOPLE

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,700
TO TELL THEM...

42
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,700
I'M COMING BACK
TO WORK HERE.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,400
SORRY IF IT INTERFERED

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,500
WITH YOUR PLAN
TO MAIM ME.

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,100
DONUT'S A NICE TOUCH.

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,900
IT'S JUST A WAY OF SAYING
"WELCOME BACK."

47
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,800
THE SEIZURE COULD BE
THE RESULT OF DEHYDRATION

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,400
OR SOMETHING NEUROLOGICAL.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,100
OR THE ECSTASY YOU FOUND
IN HER SYSTEM.

50
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,000
ACCORDING TO DR. HADLEY,

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,800
THE PATIENT TOOK THE DRUGS

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,200
ABOUT FIVE HOURS
BEFORE THE SEIZURE, SO.

53
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
WHAT DOES THIRTEEN KNOW
ABOUT IT?

54
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,400
UH, APPARENTLY SHE WAS
WITH THE PATIENT LAST NIGHT.

55
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,600
AT 3:00 A.M.?

56
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,800
OH, YEAH.

57
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,800
<i>PENTHOUSE FORUM MEETS
MEDICAL MYSTERY.</i>

58
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,100
MAYBE THERE IS A GOD.

59
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,800
EMPTY TRANSIENT SEX?

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,100
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU

61
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
TO SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL

62
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,800
EVER SINCE YOU GOT
YOUR HUNTINGTON'S DIAGNOSIS,

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,600
BUT THIS IS MORE
THAN I DARED HOPE FOR.

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
PATIENT'S SEIZURE RESULTED
FROM DEHYDRATION,

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,800
WHICH RESULTED FROM A COCKTAIL
OF ALCOHOL AND ECSTASY.

66
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,600
<i>MYSTERY SOLVED.</i>

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,000
WAIT.
WERE YOU DOING DRUGS?

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,400
NOT DIAGNOSTICALLY RELEVANT.

69
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,300
<i>DEPENDS WHAT
WE'RE TRYING TO DIAGNOSE.</i>

70
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
IT'S HOW STEEP OF A SPIRAL
YOU'RE ON.

71
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,700
OUR PATIENT HEMORRHAGED
INTO HER EYE TWO YEARS AGO.

72
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,100
ALSO NOT DIAGNOSTICALLY
RELEVANT.

73
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,400
RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION
WAS FIXED.

74
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,900
HER DOCTOR SAID IT WAS
A VENOUS ANOMALY.

75
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,000
<i>IS HE IN THIS ROOM?</i>

76
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,700
<i>BECAUSE IF HE'S NOT,</i>

77
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,000
<i>I DON'T CARE WHAT HE THINKS.</i>

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
UNLESS HE'S A SHE

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,100
AND SHE WAS
THERE LAST NIGHT TOO,

80
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,900
IN WHICH CASE
I CARE VERY DEEPLY.

81
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,400
<i>WHAT IF THE EYE PROBLEM
WASN'T WITH HER VEIN,</i>

82
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,200
BUT WITH HER BLOOD?

83
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
WOULD EXPLAIN WHY SHE SEIZED,
WHY SHE'S ALWAYS TIRED.

84
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,300
SHE PARTIES TILL 3:00 A.M.

85
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,400
THAT'S WHY SHE'S ALWAYS TIRED.

86
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,600
YET YOU SEEM FINE.

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
SHE'S VISITED FOUR OTHER DOCTORS
IN THE PAST YEAR.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,400
NONE OF THEM FOUND ANYTHING.

89
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
SHE'S A HYPOCHONDRIAC
WHO DRANK TOO MUCH.

90
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
BLOOD CLOTS COULD EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING.

91
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,200
<i>MAKES SENSE.</i>

92
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,500
BONE MARROW'S IN OVERDRIVE.
TOO MANY PLATELETS.

93
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,300
SORRY.

94
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,500
THIRTEEN,

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,300
GO STICK A NEEDLE

96
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,200
IN YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S PELVIS.

97
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,300
AND NO, THAT ONE WASN'T
A METAPHOR.

98
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,700
SUCK OUT SOME MARROW.

99
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
THAT ONE WAS.

100
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,800
I LIKE TO WATCH.

101
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,900
<i>I CAN HANDLE THIS ALONE.</i>

102
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,500
YOU'VE ALREADY HANDLED IT.

103
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,700
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED
A CHAPERONE.

104
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,300
OF COURSE,
I'M A VERY PERMISSIVE,

105
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,900
UNDERSTANDING CHAPERONE.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,800
SO FEEL FREE TO IGNORE ME.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,500
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE
IN THE MOOD TO START KISSING,

108
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,200
<i>OR GROPING,
OR SHOWERING.</i>

109
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,600
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE
DR. HOUSE.

110
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,700
HE MISTAKES IMMATURITY
FOR EDGINESS.

111
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,900
YOU'RE DR. HOUSE?

112
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,100
I ASSUME MY NAME CAME UP
LAST NIGHT

113
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,600
IN THE FORM OF A MOAN.

114
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,300
<i>YOU HAD SEX, THEN A SEIZURE.</i>

115
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,600
COULD BE A PARTICULAR
POSITION OR ACTIVITY

116
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
THAT SET IT OFF.

117
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,500
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VALID
MEDICAL THEORY, DOESN'T IT?

118
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,200
I'M REALLY SORRY.
JUST IGNORE HIM.

119
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,700
WHATEVER YOU THINK WE DID,
WE-WE DID.

120
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,900
<i>AND THEN SOME.</i>

121
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,000
LIGHTS ON OR OFF?

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,100
DO YOU HAVE A MEDICAL
RATIONALIZATION FOR THAT ONE?

123
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,200
LIGHT SENSITIVITY.

124
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
ON.

125
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,100
<i>HUH.</i>

126
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,700
FIGURED SHE HAD MORE SHAME
THAN THAT.

127
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,800
<i>DID SHE TALK DIRTY,
OR DID YOU RELY</i>

128
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,700
ON VAGUE HAND SIGNALS?

129
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,600
SHE'S, UH, PRETTY DIRECT
ABOUT WHAT SHE WANTS.

130
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,400
I'M LEARNING SO MUCH.

131
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,100
OKAY, SCORE THE SCORE.

132
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,300
<i>SCALE OF ONE TO TEN.</i>

133
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,100
DON'T ANSWER.

134
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
SEVEN.

135
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,600
FINALLY GOT ONE RIGHT.

136
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,700
YOU WANT TO INVESTIGATE HIM

137
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,100
BECAUSE HE ATE A DONUT?

138
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,200
HE CLAIMED HE HAD
A MORNING MEETING

139
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,300
AT MICKEY'S DINER.

140
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,600
WILSON LOVES MICKEY'S DINER.

141
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
HE HAS THE FRENCH TOAST TOWER

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,400
WHENEVER HE SETS FOOT
IN THE DOOR.

143
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,700
THERE'S NO WAY HE WOULD'VE COME
TO WORK

144
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,100
WANTING MORE CARBS.

145
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
HE LIED TO ME.

146
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
I NEED TO KNOW WHY.

147
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL FIND OUT?

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
I'M WORRIED
THAT HE MIGHT BE A SPY.

149
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,300
HE'S BEEN GONE FOUR MONTHS.

150
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
??? the friendsHIP
HAS CHANGED.

151
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
I'M JUST NOT SURE
IF HE'S WORKING

152
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,600
FOR HIROHITO
OR THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS.

153
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,100
YOU PLAYED A PRACTICAL JOKE
ON HIM.

154
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,800
HE DIDN'T LAUGH.

155
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,300
I NEED SOMETHING
TO LORD OVER HIM, A LIE-

156
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,500
HE DIDN'T TRY TO RETALIATE.

157
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,700
HE MORALIZED.

158
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,100
HE ALWAYS MORALIZED.

159
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,500
HE ALWAYS MORALIZED
AND GOT EVEN.

160
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,900
HE HASN'T FIRED BACK.

161
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,500
THINGS ALWAYS CHANGE.

162
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,700
AND THAT SUCKS.

163
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,600
YEAH.

164
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,400
FIND OUT WHERE HE WAS.

165
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,600
SHOULD'VE KNOWN
IT WASN'T A COINCIDENCE.

166
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,100
FOUND YOUR LETTERS.

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,300
YOU RECOGNIZED HOUSE'S NAME.

168
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,400
AND YOU'RE THE FIRST PATIENT
I'VE SEEN

169
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,600
WHO ACTUALLY ENJOYED
BEING ACCOSTED BY HIM.

170
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,100
I WOULD'VE TOLD YOU, BUT-

171
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,600
<i>WHAT EXACTLY WOULD YOU
HAVE TOLD ME?</i>

172
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
THAT YOU SLEPT WITH ME
TO GET TO HOUSE?

173
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
THAT YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET HIM

174
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,900
TO TAKE YOUR CASE
FOR OVER A YEAR?

175
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,500
I'M SICK.

176
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,100
NO ONE EVEN WROTE BACK.

177
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,300
YOU USED ME.

178
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,700
- you use me.
- MY MOTIVES WERE CLEAR.

179
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
YOU MIGHT'VE FIGURED OUT
MY MOTIVES FASTER

180
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,000
IF YOU BOTHERED TO ASK MY NAME.

181
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,300
I FOLLOWED YOU TO THAT BAR

182
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,400
BECAUSE I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU.

183
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,600
<i>SEE IF YOU'D HELP ME GET
TO HOUSE.</i>

184
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,900
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BE
SO AGGRESSIVE.

185
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,200
WAS THAT SEIZURE EVEN REAL?

186
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,900
WHY WOULD I FAKE A SYMPTOM?

187
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,300
IT WOULD JUST MAKE IT HARDER
FOR HOUSE TO DIAGNOSE ME.

188
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,400
THERE'S NOTHING TO DIAGNOSE.

189
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,100
YOUR BIOPSY RESULTS
ARE NEGATIVE.

190
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
THEN IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

191
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,700
GET DRESSED.

192
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,800
I'M DISCHARGING YOU.

193
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,300
HOUSE ADMITTED ME.

194
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,500
HE OBVIOUSLY THINKS-

195
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,700
<i>HOUSE IS USING YOU
AS AN EXCUSE</i>

196
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,600
TO STICK HIS NOSE
IN MY PERSONAL LIFE.

197
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,500
<i>I'M TIRED ALL THE TIME.</i>

198
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,000
SOME NIGHTS I FALL ASLEEP
AT 10:00

199
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,700
AND WAKE UP AT NOON,
STILL TIRED.

200
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,600
<i>EVERY DOCTOR I SEE</i>

201
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,300
TELLS ME
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG.

202
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,900
<i>AND THAT PROVES WHAT,
EXACTLY?</i>

203
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,700
THAT THEY'RE WRONG,
OR THAT YOU'RE WRONG?

204
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,400
OH, COME ON.
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE-

205
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,100
SIT BACK.

206
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,100
DEEP BREATHS.
TRY AND RELAX.

207
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,700
GET THE PADDLES.

208
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,900
SHE'S GONNA CRASH.

209
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,200
DAMN.

210
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,900
WE HAD TO USE PADDLES

211
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,600
TO STABILIZE
THE PATIENT'S HEART.

212
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
EYE ISSUE, BRAIN ISSUE,

213
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,100
NOW A HEART ISSUE.

214
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,300
SOUNDS LIKE A REAL CASE
TO ME.

215
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,600
yeah, I GET IT.
I WAS WRONG.

216
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,400
CAN WE MOVE ON?

217
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,700
YOU'RE JUST UPSET

218
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,000
BECAUSE THE WHOLE TIME
SHE WAS WITH YOU,

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,200
SHE WAS THINKING
OF MY HUGE, THROBBING...

220
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,200
DIAGNOSTIC SKILLS.

221
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,100
DRUGS WOULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

222
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,500
THIS MORNING,
YOU REJECTED DRUGS.

223
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,100
THAT'S WHEN I THOUGHT
THAT THIRTEEN WAS RIGHT

224
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,000
AND WAS JUST
JERKING HER AROUND.

225
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,500
CARDIAC ARREST MEANS

226
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,300
SHE COULD BE
A SERIOUS USER.

227
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,500
GREAT.

228
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,500
WHAT?

229
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,300
THAT MEANS THAT SOMETHING
SHE DID AT MY PLACE

230
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
SET THIS OFF.

231
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,600
EITHER SHE BROUGHT DRUGS IN,

232
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,500
OR SHE GRABBED SOMETHING
FROM MY MEDICINE CABINET.

233
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,000
AND THAT MEANS MY PLACE
NEEDS TO BE SEARCHED.

234
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,800
NOW, I'D BE HAPPY
TO DO THAT MYSELF,

235
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT WOULD BE
FAR LESS TITILLATING

236
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,600
FOR HOUSE,
SO HE'S ABOUT TO COME UP

237
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,100
<i>WITH SOME CONVOLUTED
MEDICAL REASON</i>

238
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,300
WHY I HAVE TO STAY HERE
WHILE HE GOES THROUGH MY STUFF.

239
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
PATIENT'S DAD
HAD BYPASS SURGERY.

240
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
MEANS SHE'S A CANDIDATE
FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS.

241
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,600
SHE NEEDS AN ULTRASOUND.

242
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,400
THAT WAS MUCH LESS CONVOLUTED
THAN WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

243
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,300
I'M NOT GIVING YOU MY KEYS.

244
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,700
IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS,
I'M GOING.

245
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,300
WHO COULD PICK A LOCK?

246
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,700
I'LL GO.

247
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,100
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T STEAL
ANY UNDERWEAR.

248
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,900
<i>YOU'RE A DISGRACE
TO YOUR STEREOTYPE.</i>

249
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,300
MOVE OVER.

250
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,400
THINK YOU CAN PICK A LOCK
FASTER THAN ME?

251
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,700
NO NEED TO PICK.

252
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,300
NICE.

253
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,300
STEAL FROM YOUR EMPLOYEES.

254
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,300
NEVER.

255
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,400
I HAD MY DICK MAKE KEYS

256
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,600
WHEN I HIRED HIM
TO DICK UP THE TEAM.

257
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,000
ALWAYS IMAGINED SHE'D HAVE
A SEX SWING

258
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

259
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,100
GIVE ME MY KEY.

260
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,300
DON'T HAVE YOUR KEY.

261
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,600
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU HIRED LUCAS

262
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
TO INVESTIGATE EVERYONE
EXCEPT FOR ME?

263
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,600
WASTE OF MONEY.

264
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,400
I ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOU.

265
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,200
THIRTEEN HAD HER PURSE.

266
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,500
THAT'S GOTTA BE THE PATIENT'S.

267
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,700
CHECK IT FOR DRUGS.

268
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,500
I CALL SHOTGUN
ON THE BEDROOM.

269
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,800
YOU KNOW THAT I STOLE A CAR
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER.

270
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
<i>YOU KNOW THAT MY MOM</i>

271
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,700
HAS ALZHEIMER'S.

272
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,900
YOU KNOW NOTHING ELSE.

273
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,600
<i>WANT ME TO HAVE YOU
INVESTIGATED?</i>

274
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,800
WHEN DID YOU GET SO NEEDY?

275
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,600
<i>NOT NEEDY.</i>

276
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,900
<i>JUST DON'T BUY IT.</i>

277
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,800
<i>YOU ALWAYS WANT
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE.</i>

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
LOOK WHERE WE ARE.

279
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,000
<i>PURSE IS CLEAN.</i>

280
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,900
LAST NIGHT WASN'T
THE FIRST TIME

281
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,700
THAT THIRTEEN BROUGHT HOME
SOME STRANGE.

282
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,800
IF YOU FOUND HER DIARY-

283
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,100
NO TOYS.

284
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
<i>YOU SLEEP WITH THE SAME PERSON
OVER AND OVER,</i>

285
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,600
THAT'S WHEN YOU NEED
ACCESSORIES.

286
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,800
<i>FIRST TIME IS PLENTY EXCITING
ON ITS OWN.</i>

287
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
UNLESS...

288
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,700
YOU THINK AN ASTHMA INHALER

289
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
COULD BE USED
AS A SEX TOY?

290
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
THERE ARE WAYS OF GETTING
TO KNOW PEOPLE

291
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
WITHOUT COMMITTING FELONIES.

292
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,800
PEOPLE INTEREST ME.

293
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
CONVERSATIONS DON'T.

294
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,100
BECAUSE CONVERSATIONS
GO BOTH WAYS.

295
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,600
- LIKE THIRTEEN.
- LIKE THIRTEEN.

296
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,000
BROWN RECLUSE.

297
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,400
FOUND IT AT YOUR APARTMENT.

298
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
THEIR VENOM CAN CAUSE
SEIZURES AND HEART PROBLEMS.

299
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,300
UNLESS THE ULTRASOUND
SHOWED ANYTHING-

300
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,100
<i>NO.</i>

301
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,400
WHAT ROOM DID YOU FIND IT IN?

302
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
<i>BATHROOM.</i>

303
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,000
NICE BIDET, BY THE WAY.
VERY REFRESHING.

304
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,300
I DON'T HAVE A BIDET.

305
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,300
OH.

306
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,300
<i>SPIDER'S NOT THE ONLY</i>

307
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,100
INTERESTING THING I FOUND.

308
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,300
YEAH, MY INHALER IS FASCINATING.

309
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,900
IT'S GOT ITS OWN EXTENSIVE
ONLINE FOLLOWING.

310
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
YOU HAVE ASTHMA?

311
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,600
WHEN I WAS A KID.

312
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,800
<i>IT STARTED ACTING UP AGAIN
WHEN I MOVED INTO MY NEW PLACE.</i>

313
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
YOU MOVED?

314
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,300
- WHO CARES?
- HE DOESN'T.

315
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,000
HE'S JUST SURPRISED
HE DIDN'T KNOW.

316
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,300
YOU WITHHOLD THINGS

317
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,100
OTHER PEOPLE
WOULD NEVER BOTHER TO.

318
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,900
THE MOVE,
A LITTLE WHEEZE,

319
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,200
WHATEVER YOU THOUGHT
WAS IN MY POCKET

320
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,300
INSTEAD OF YOUR INHALER.

321
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,000
MAYBE I SHOULD MAKE
A RETURN TRIP TO YOUR PLACE.

322
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,700
<i>SPIDER BITE DOESN'T EXPLAIN
ANYTHING</i>

323
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,600
UNLESS THE PATIENT
WAS ACTUALLY BITTEN BY A SPIDER.

324
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,700
I'LL DO THE EXAM.

325
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
<i>DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE.</i>

326
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,400
IT'D BE BETTER IF A WOMAN
GROPES HER.

327
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,400
THERE'S NO SEXUAL TENSION
THAT WAY.

328
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
I NEED YOU TO STAND UP
AND TAKE OFF YOUR GOWN.

329
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,800
I THINK I WOULD'VE FELT
A SPIDER BITING ME.

330
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,300
NOT NECESSARILY.

331
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,200
YOU REALLY NEED THOSE
AFTER EVERYTHING

332
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,600
WE DID THE OTHER NIGHT?

333
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
THE OTHER NIGHT
I WASN'T YOUR DOCTOR.

334
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,700
HOW LONG ARE YOU
GONNA STAY MAD AT ME?

335
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING
TO BE HERE?

336
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,800
OH.

337
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,100
OKAY, THEN.

338
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,300
LOOK...

339
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
I REALLY HAD NO INTENTION

340
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,300
OF EVER SEEING YOU AGAIN.

341
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,400
SO...

342
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,300
HAVING ME END UP HERE

343
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,500
IS A LITTLE LESS
THAN IDEAL.

344
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,400
I GET IT.

345
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,300
BUT... WE JUST MET.

346
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,600
HOW'D YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE ME AGAIN?

347
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,300
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

348
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,500
I'M JUST REALLY NOT THAT INTO
REPEAT PERFORMANCES.

349
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,000
<i>I FIGURED I WASN'T
THE FIRST GIRL YOU CRUISED.</i>

350
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,300
WHY IS THAT?

351
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
YOU'RE AWFULLY GOOD AT IT.

352
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,200
YOU'D THINK WITH ALL THAT
EXPERIENCE

353
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,500
THAT I'D BE BETTER
THAN A SEVEN.

354
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,000
WE JUST MET.

355
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
WE WERE BOTH DRUNK.

356
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,100
NOT LIKE
THERE WASN'T POTENTIAL.

357
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,800
LITTLE MORE PRACTICE
FOR THE BOTH OF US,

358
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,400
I'D SAY WE'RE LOOKING
AT A NINE.

359
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,700
EASY.

360
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,100
BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE
A REPEAT PERFORMANCE.

361
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE
YOUR HAND.

362
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,700
I DIDN'T.

363
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
MY HAND'S ON YOUR HIP.

364
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,300
YOU DON'T FEEL THAT?

365
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,800
NO.

366
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,800
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

367
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,600
IT MEANS IT'S NOT
A SPIDER BITE.

368
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,900
BLOOD TEST CONFIRMS
LOW POTASSIUM LEVELS.

369
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,600
EXPLAINS THE NUMBNESS
IN HER HIP.

370
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,400
IT'S NOT GOOD,
BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT TIME

371
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,600
FOR AT LEAST ONE
OR TWO COMMENTS

372
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,700
ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE.

373
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,800
WHICH YOU JUST WASTED

374
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,500
WITH THAT COMMENT
ABOUT MY COMMENTS.

375
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,500
LOW POTASSIUM MEANS
HER HEART PROBLEM

376
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,200
WAS A SYMPTOM
OF A KIDNEY PROBLEM.

377
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,500
WHAT CAUSED THE KIDNEY PROBLEM?

378
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,900
COULD BE I.G.A. NEPHROPATHY.

379
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,400
NOT WITHOUT BLOOD
IN THE URINE.

380
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,600
P.S.A.G.N.?

381
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,200
NOT WITH NORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE.

382
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,100
RENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS.

383
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,100
<i>HER KIDNEY'S DON'T FILTER ACID
OUT OF THE BLOOD.</i>

384
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,600
<i>EXCESS ACID
DRIVES DOWN POTASSIUM,</i>

385
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,400
<i>CAUSES KIDNEY CALCIFICATIONS.</i>

386
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,900
IF IT'S RTA,

387
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,500
<i>ALL SHE NEEDS IS SODIUM
BICARBONATE FOR THE ACID</i>

388
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,900
<i>AND SURGERY TO REMOVE
THE CALCIFICATIONS.</i>

389
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
CT HER KIDNEYS.

390
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,400
IF YOU FIND CALCIFICATIONS,

391
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,900
WE HAVE OUR DIAGNOSIS.

392
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,400
<i>WHAT'S HE DOING NOW?</i>

393
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,900
HE'S PLAYING
THAT CARJACKING VIDEO GAME.

394
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,800
HE'D GET A LOT FARTHER
IF HE DIDN'T STOP

395
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
AT ALL THE RED LIGHTS.

396
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,000
MAYBE HE WAS DOING SOMETHING

397
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
HE THINKS I'LL MOCK HIM FOR.

398
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,400
LIKE...

399
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,200
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

400
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S THAT.

401
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,700
I DON'T THINK
IT'S JUST ABOUT ANYTHING?

402
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,500
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S ABOUT ANYTHING TRIVIAL.

403
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,800
IF YOU WEREN'T WORRIED,

404
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,200
<i>YOU WOULDN'T BE SITTING
IN MY CAR.</i>

405
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,800
MAYBE HE'S SEEING A SHRINK.

406
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,800
<i>THAT DOES NOT LOOK
LIKE A PIZZA DELIVERY.</i>

407
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,900
<i>DOESN'T MATTER IF IT ISN'T.</i>

408
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,400
<i>WILSON DOESN'T BUY HIS PIZZA.</i>

409
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,700
THERE'S EIGHT UNITS
IN THIS BUILDING.

410
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,800
THERE'S GOT TO BE A PERVERT
LIKE ME

411
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,400
LIVING IN
AT LEAST ONE OF THEM.

412
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,300
YES, BECAUSE YOU REPRESENT
ONE OUT OF EVERY EIGHT PEOPLE

413
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,600
LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY.

414
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,100
<i>APPARENTLY HE HAS DEVELOPED
A TASTE FOR PIZZA.</i>

415
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
AH, THINGS CHANGE.

416
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,500
CT SHOWS ONE MORE CALCIFICATION

417
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,400
NEAR THE SUPERIOR PYRAMID
ON THE LEFT KIDNEY.

418
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,400
SEE IT.

419
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,800
THAT, UM, THING
YOU WERE HOPING

420
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,500
HOUSE DIDN'T FIND
AT YOUR PLACE.

421
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,600
I, UH, I FOUND IT.

422
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,400
HE DID THE CAG TEST
TWO WEEKS AGO.

423
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,700
A NUMBER THIS HIGH

424
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,600
MEANS YOU HAVE LESS TIME
THAN YOU THOUGHT.

425
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,300
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE
YOU'D BE UPSET.

426
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,200
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO SELF-DESTRUCT.

427
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,900
IT'S NOT NOBLE FOR YOU
TO PROTECT ME FROM HOUSE

428
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,800
IF YOU'RE JUST GONNA JUDGE-

429
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
THERE ARE THINGS
YOU SHOULD BE DOING.

430
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,500
WORKING OUT, IMPROVING BALANCE
AND COORDINATION.

431
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,300
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A BLAST.

432
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,800
I'M HAVING FUN.

433
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,300
CRAMMING AS MUCH LIFE
INTO MY LIFE AS I CAN.

434
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,200
YOU'RE DOING DRUGS.

435
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,400
STAYING UP ALL NIGHT,
HAVING SEX WITH STRANGERS.

436
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,900
IT SOUNDS FUN TO ME.

437
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
GOOD NIGHT.

438
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,400
CLOSE THE INCISIONS.

439
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,800
SHE WON'T EVEN HAVE
A SCAR.

440
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,400
HER O2 STATS ARE DROPPING.

441
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
DID YOU NICK SOMETHING?

442
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,900
PROCEDURE WAS CLEAN.
BP'S STRONG.

443
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,000
WELL, SHE'S NOT BREATHING.
WE NEED TO INTUBATE.

444
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,400
THE BREATHING PROBLEM STARTED

445
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,500
AFTER WE FIXED
HER KIDNEY PROBLEM.

446
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
MEANS THE RTA
ISN'T THE UNDERLYING CAUSE.

447
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,700
WHERE'S THIRTEEN?

448
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,400
TRAFFIC'S BAD.
SHE'S PROBABLY JUST-

449
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,800
NOT HERE.

450
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,600
<i>IT'S NOT HER LUNGS.</i>

451
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,500
NO MASSES, NO INFILTRATES.

452
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,200
LUNGS ARE WORKING,
BUT SHE STILL CAN'T BREATHE.

453
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,800
DISTRIBUTION PLANT
CAN'T DISTRIBUTE

454
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,100
IF IT'S NOT GETTING
DELIVERIES.

455
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,900
IF HER LUNGS ARE FINE,

456
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,400
MAYBE THE PROBLEM'S
IN THE SUPPLY LINE.

457
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,100
AIRWAY COLLAPSE.

458
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,300
<i>THAT COULD SIGNAL AUTOIMMUNE</i>

459
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,600
OR SOME KIND OF DYSTROPHY
AS THE UNDERLYING CAUSE.

460
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,700
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT

461
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,200
IF HER AIRWAY FAILED.

462
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,400
<i>MAKE IT HAPPEN AGAIN.</i>

463
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,100
STICK THIRTEEN'S
CARPET CLEANER ON A TREADMILL.

464
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,000
METHACHOLINE CHALLENGE.

465
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,500
AND SOMEONE FIND THE CARPET.

466
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
EXAM GOING ON.
15 MINUTES.

467
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,800
GOOD MORNING,
DR. HADLEY.

468
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,200
JUST SPOKE TO MY BROTHER.

469
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,200
AND BY BROTHER,
YOU MEAN?

470
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,700
I MEAN MY PARENTS'
OTHER SON.

471
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,800
WOW.
SAME DAD.

472
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
 GOT A CALL LAST WEEK
FROM YOUR P.I.

473
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,700
YOU LIED.

474
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,300
YOU DID HAVE ME INVESTIGATED.

475
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,800
YOU'VE BEEN TAUNTING THE TEAM

476
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,500
WITH WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED,

477
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,200
BUT YOU NEVER CAME AFTER ME.

478
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,400
MEANS YOU COULDN'T FIND
ANYTHING.

479
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,200
YOU'RE RIGHT.

480
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,900
<i>THAT'S BECAUSE</i>

481
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,800
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
STUPID, SPONTANEOUS,

482
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,400
OR EVEN VAGUELY INTERESTING
SINCE YOU WERE 17.

483
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,900
AND THAT'S JUST SAD.

484
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I FOUND HER IN THE CLINIC

485
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,900
GIVING HERSELF IV FLUIDS.

486
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,200
<i>AT LEAST YOU COULD'VE
LET HER FINISH.</i>

487
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
SHE LOOKS TERRIBLE.

488
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,700
SHE HAS A FRESH NIGHTCLUB STAMP

489
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,700
ON HER WRIST.

490
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
SHE'S IN NO CONDITION
TO PRACTICE.

491
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,800
UNLESS THIS IS A PRELUDE
TO AN ACTUAL SPANKING,

492
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,900
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR ME TO BE-

493
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,400
I WANT HER TO TAKE
A DRUG TEST.

494
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,700
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME DO THAT.

495
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,000
BUT I CAN SUSPEND YOU
UNTIL YOU DO.

496
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,300
BECAUSE SHE WENT TO A NIGHTCLUB
IN HER FREE TIME?

497
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,300
OR BECAUSE SHE HAD SEX
IN HER FREE TIME?

498
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,500
PATIENT WAS UNDERGOING
ROUTINE SURGERY

499
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,300
FOR RTA.

500
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,700
DIDN'T NEED THIRTEEN HERE
FOR THAT.

501
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,300
AND I DON'T NEED YOU
MAKING MY EMPLOYEES

502
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,200
PUNCH A CLOCK
OR PEE IN A CUP.

503
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,100
LET'S GO.

504
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
COME ON.

505
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,800
THANK YOU.

506
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,500
BY THE WAY,

507
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
THE SURGERY WAS NOT ROUTINE.

508
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
PATIENT STOPPED BREATHING

509
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,500
AND YOU MISSED
A DIFFERENTIAL.

510
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,000
YOU'RE FIRED.

511
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,900
WHAT?

512
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,600
YOU JUST DEFENDED ME.

513
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,400
NO, I JUST PREVENTED YOU
FROM GETTING A DRUG TEST.

514
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,900
PROBABLY SAVED YOUR CAREER.

515
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,100
I'M ALREADY TAKING
RESPONSIBILITY

516
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,700
FOR ONE DOCTOR
WITH A DRUG HABIT.

517
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,400
I DON'T HAVE A DRUG HABIT.

518
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,300
THE SLUTTY PARTY GIRL
IS FUN

519
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,300
TILL SHE PUKES
ON YOUR SHOES.

520
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,300
THEN SHE'S JUST A PAIN
IN THE ASS.

521
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,200
I HAVEN'T SAT ON THIS COUCH
FOR FOUR MONTHS.

522
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,600
IT REMEMBERS MY CHEEKS.

523
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,300
I MISS THIS.

524
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,200
ME TOO.

525
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,900
ME TRYING TO WORK.

526
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,200
YOU INTERRUPTING.

527
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,000
OH, COME ON.

528
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,900
YOUR PATIENTS COULD WAIT
FIVE MINUTES.

529
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,100
GET ME CAUGHT UP.

530
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
COME ON,
WHAT DID YOU DO?

531
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,000
TRAVEL?

532
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,400
DID YOU GET A NEW HOBBY?

533
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,500
DID YOU MEET SOMEONE?

534
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,500
ACTUALLY, YES.

535
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,300
I SORT OF STARTED DATING
SOMEONE.

536
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,700
GREAT.

537
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,100
WHAT DOES SHE DO?

538
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,500
IS SHE... AN ACTRESS?

539
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,700
NO.

540
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,900
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

541
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
I JUST FIGURED YOU'D

542
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,700
WANT SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE...

543
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:54,900
EXCITING.

544
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,100
SHE'S NOT...

545
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,200
YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT ANYWAY

546
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA MEET HER.

547
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,800
SHE'S... A PROSTITUTE.

548
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,500
USED TO BE.

549
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,700
SHE MADE SOME MISTAKES.

550
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,600
SINGLE MOM,
HAD SOME DRUG ISSUES.

551
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,500
BUT...
SHE'S SO SMART.

552
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,000
SHE WANTS TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL.

553
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
AND... I TOLD HER
I'D HELP HER

554
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,700
WITH TUITION.

555
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,600
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN HER?

556
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,700
OH, I KNEW YOU'D BE LIKE THIS.

557
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,900
I ASKED A QUESTION.

558
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,300
HOUSE...

559
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,800
YOU ARE A DRUG ADDICT.

560
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,000
YOU GO TO PROSTITUTES.

561
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,300
YOU CAN'T BE JUDGMENTAL.

562
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,100
AND YET.

563
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,800
PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

564
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,700
I WAS HURTING,
AND I WANTED TO FEEL GOOD.

565
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT

566
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,000
TO GO THIS WAY.

567
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,100
I...

568
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,400
AMBER...

569
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,500
SAID THAT SHE WANTED ME
TO MOVE ON.

570
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,000
THAT SHE WANTED ME TO...

571
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,400
BE HAPPY.

572
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
AND...

573
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,200
DEBBIE MAKES ME HAPPY.

574
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,700
IF YOU'RE HAPPY, I'M...

575
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,300
I HEARD.

576
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,700
YEAH.

577
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,600
I'M LOOKING
FOR MY TICKET BACK.

578
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,700
SORRY IF I UPSET YOU.

579
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,500
I DIDN'T WANT TO INVADE
YOUR PRIVACY.

580
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,600
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

581
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,100
CAN YOU GET ME CAUGHT UP?

582
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,800
THINK YOU'RE GONNA FIND
SOMETHING WE DIDN'T?

583
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,400
IT'S GOOD FOR THE PATIENT.

584
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
GOOD FOR ME.

585
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,900
FILMS ARE CLEAN.

586
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,200
 WE RULED OUT HYPERTENSION.

587
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,700
GUYS HAVE HER ON A TREADMILL

588
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,600
<i>RUNNING
A METHACHOLINE CHALLENGE.</i>

589
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,200
AND I STILL THINK YOU'VE BEEN
ACTING LIKE AN IDIOT.

590
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,000
I KNOW.

591
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,200
DID YOU TALK
ABOUT WHETHER THIS LUNG FIELD

592
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,300
LOOKS A LITTLE DARK?

593
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,600
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
OVER-EXPOSED.

594
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,700
OR HER DIAPHRAGM'S
A LITTLE FLAT.

595
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,200
COULD BE A SIGN
OF HYPERINFLATION.

596
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,900
SUGGESTS A PULMONARY
OBSTRUCTION.

597
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,300
LUNG CYSTS.

598
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,300
THEY WOULDN'T SHOW UP
ON AN X-RAY.

599
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,700
TREADMILL TEST
ISN'T GONNA CLOSE HER AIRWAY.

600
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,400
IT'LL MAKE HER LUNGS
EXPLODE.

601
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,000
HER THROAT'S FINE.

602
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,500
WE MADE HER AIRWAY COLLAPSE,

603
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,300
BUT IT'S NOT COLLAPSED.

604
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,800
YOU RUPTURED A CYST!

605
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,200
<i>HER LUNG COLLAPSED.</i>

606
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,900
BREATH SOUNDS ON BOTH SIDES.

607
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,900
MOVE.

608
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,300
TRACHEA'S DEVIATING
TO THE LEFT.

609
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
NICE.

610
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,500
<i>CHEST CT CONFIRMED
MULTIPLE LUNG CYSTS,</i>

611
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,200
<i>ONE OF WHICH BURST
DURING THE TREADMILL TEST.</i>

612
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,600
LUCKILY, THIRTEEN FIGURED OUT

613
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,700
<i>THE PROBLEM AND WAS THERE
TO RE-INFLATE HER LUNG.</i>

614
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,200
<i>LUNG CYSTS PLUS
ALL HER OTHER SYMPTOMS</i>

615
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,000
<i>COULD BE AMYLOIDOSIS,</i>

616
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,800
WHICH WE CAN MANAGE.

617
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,400
OR PULMONARY FIBROSIS WHICH-

618
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,300
THANK YOU.

619
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,000
MY EMPLOYEES CAN TAKE
CARE OF IT FROM HERE.

620
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,900
WE NEED TO BIOPSY THE CYSTS.

621
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,500
YOU FIRED ME

622
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,400
BECAUSE I SCREWED UP.

623
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,300
I JUST PROVED I CAN PULL
MY WEIGHT.

624
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,500
ALL YOU PROVED IS YOU KNOW
HOW TO MAKE AN ENTRANCE.

625
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,400
<i>HOUSE, SHE DESERVES
ANOTHER SHOT.</i>

626
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,000
SHE FOUND THE CYSTS,
SAVED THE PATIENT.

627
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,100
<i>WHO WOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED
SAVING</i>

628
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,000
IF THIRTEEN HAD SHOWN UP

629
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,700
AT THE DIFFERENTIAL
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

630
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,900
GIVE HER
HER JOB BACK, HOUSE.

631
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,900
OR WHAT?

632
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
YOU'RE GONNA QUIT?

633
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,800
GO DO THE BIOPSY.

634
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,000
I'M SORRY.

635
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,100
HOW MUCH CLEARER
DO I NEED TO MAKE THIS?

636
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,000
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN,
"DATING A HOOKER"?

637
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,700
HE'S AN IDIOT
WITH A MESSIAH COMPLEX.

638
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,200
SAVIOR TO ALL WHO NEED SAVING.

639
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,100
THAT'S WHY HIS FIRST WIFE
HAD A WOODEN LEG.

640
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,600
SECOND WIFE WAS CANADIAN.

641
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,600
HE'S THE ONE WHO NEEDS
TO BE SAVED.

642
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,700
FROM YOU OR THE HO?

643
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,800
THE HO'S JUST USING HIM
FOR HIS MONEY.

644
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,400
WAIT.
BAD EXAMPLE.

645
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,700
NORMALLY IN THESE SITUATIONS,

646
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
I'D FOLLOW THE GIRL,

647
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,900
FIND OUT SOMETHING EMBARRASSING
ABOUT HER TO SHOW HIM.

648
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,500
BUT SINCE THAT'S
OUR STARTING POSITION...

649
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,700
PROCEED DIRECTLY
TO THE LEG-BREAKING.

650
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,500
I'M NOT BREAKING HER LEGS.

651
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,000
SHE PROBABLY HAS A PIMP.

652
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,400
OR, AT LEAST,
AN OLDER BROTHER.

653
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,700
OR A YOUNGER BROTHER.

654
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,500
OR OVERPROTECTIVE SISTER.

655
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,300
FIND HER, FIND HER FAMILY,

656
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,000
FIND CLIENT NUMBER NINE.

657
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,200
JUST GET ME SOMETHING
I CAN USE

658
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,600
TO FORCE HER TO BACK OFF.

659
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,500
SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR MEETING, MANNIX.

660
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
HERE'S THE RESULT
FROM THE LUNG BIOPSY.

661
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,500
WHY NOT MEN?

662
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,900
YOU'RE BISEXUAL.

663
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,000
<i>IF YOU WERE JUST BEING
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE,</i>

664
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,100
YOU'D BE HAVING RANDOM SEX
WITH MEN.

665
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,700
<i>BETTER CHANCE
OF GETTING ASSAULTED,</i>

666
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,100
CATCHING A DISEASE.

667
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,200
IF THIS WERE
JUST ABOUT GETTING LAID,

668
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,100
IT'D BE A LOT EASIER
TO PICK UP MEN.

669
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,200
<i>OR UGLY GIRLS.</i>

670
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,000
THIS WOMAN'S HOT.

671
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,800
WHICH MEANS YOU LIKE
THE CHALLENGE,

672
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,100
THE CONQUEST.

673
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
IT'S THE CONTROL
THAT GETS YOU OFF.

674
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,300
<i>AND CONTROLLING WOMEN
IS AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET</i>

675
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,100
TO CONTROLLING
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU.

676
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,800
HERE I THOUGHT I WAS JUST
INTO BOOBS.

677
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
INSTEAD OF GETTING SWEATY
WITH A STRANGER,

678
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
WHY DON'T YOU TRY TAKING IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL?

679
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
PLAY GOD.

680
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,400
TELL A GIRL THAT SHE'S GOT
TEN YEARS TO LIVE.

681
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,700
SHE HAS LAM.

682
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,300
OKAY.

683
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,900
THIS IS NOT A TEST.

684
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,900
YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR JOB BACK
IF YOU CAN-

685
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,800
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO GET THIS NEWS,

686
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,000
AND NO ONE
SHOULD HAVE TO GET IT FROM YOU.

687
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,000
HEY.

688
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
THE BIOPSY OF YOUR LUNG CYST

689
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
<i>SHOWED SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS.</i>

690
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,000
THAT'S INDICATIVE
OF A DISEASE CALLED LAM.

691
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,800
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR THAT?

692
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,300
SURGERY TO REMOVE
THE CYSTS.

693
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,700
<i>BUT...</i>

694
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,300
THEY'LL COME BACK.

695
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,800
LITTLE BY LITTLE,

696
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,900
THE CYSTS REPLACE
HEALTHY LUNG TISSUE

697
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,600
UNTIL YOUR LUNGS STOP WORKING.

698
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,300
I'M GONNA DIE.

699
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,700
YES.

700
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,600
I'M SO SORRY.

701
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,900
THEY REMOVED ALL THE CYSTS
THEY COULD.

702
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,600
THAT SHOULD HELP YOU
BREATHE BETTER.

703
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
HOW LONG UNTIL THE CYSTS
COME BACK?

704
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,200
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

705
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'M SORRY.

706
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,400
STOP SAYING YOU'RE SORRY.

707
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,300
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.

708
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,800
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FEEL.

709
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,300
YOU'RE GONNA BE NUMB
FOR A FEW MORE DAYS.

710
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,000
THEN YOU'LL GO HOME
AND CRY FOR A FEW WEEKS.

711
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,700
AND THEN YOU GET ANGRY.

712
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,600
START TELLING YOURSELF
NOTHING MATTERS ANYMORE.

713
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,800
YOU START DOING
STUPID THINGS.

714
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,100
MAYBE YOU GO OUT TO BARS

715
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,900
AND PICK UP A BUNCH
OF WOMEN.

716
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,400
YOU'RE...

717
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE?

718
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,900
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE
THAN YOU.

719
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
MAYBE A LITTLE LESS.

720
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,100
I'LL RACE YOU.

721
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,200
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE I'D COME BACK LATER.

722
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,600
SOUNDS GOOD.

723
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,500
OH, GOD.

724
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,200
WHAT'S GOING ON?

725
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,600
ALL HER BLOOD COUNTS ARE DOWN.
IT'S A NEW SYMPTOM.

726
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
APLASTIC ANEMIA.

727
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,800
DOES THE WORD "FIRED"

728
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,800
HAVE SOME WHOLE
OTHER DEFINITION

729
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,000
THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF?

730
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,900
I DON'T WORK FOR YOU.
FINE.

731
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,700
DON'T PAY ME.

732
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
JUST LET ME FINISH OUT
THIS CASE.

733
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,400
SO YOU LIKE HER
NOW THAT SHE'S DYING.

734
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,200
WHAT HAPPENS
IF SHE STOPS DYING?

735
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,600
<i>THERE'S NO DANGER
OF THAT RIGHT NOW.</i>

736
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,900
IF WE DON'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER,

737
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,400
SHE'S GOT DAYS,
NOT YEARS.

738
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,800
<i>APLASTIC ANEMIA TAKES LAM</i>

739
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,300
<i>OFF THE TABLE.</i>

740
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,400
<i>UNFORTUNATELY, NONE OF OUR
OTHER CHOICES ARE ANY BETTER.</i>

741
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,800
PNH WITH SOME SORT
OF RESPIRATORY INFECTION.

742
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,300
BEST CASE GIVES HER 12 YEARS.

743
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,500
OR FAST-MOVING LANGERHANS.

744
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,400
A FEW MONTHS.

745
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,500
OR MASTOCYTOSIS,
WHICH CAN CAUSE SYSTEMIC SHOCK

746
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,600
AND KILL HER IN DAYS.

747
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
GO.
TEST FOR EVERYTHING.

748
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,600
NOT YOU.

749
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,500
YOU'RE JUST A VISITOR.

750
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,200
HOW'S YOUR PATIENT?

751
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,100
SHE DOESN'T HAVE LANGERHANS.

752
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,700
THAT'S GOOD.

753
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,200
ACTUALLY, A CANCER DIAGNOSIS

754
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,900
WOULD BE GOOD NEWS
RIGHT NOW.

755
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,700
DO YOU THINK...

756
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,100
I'M BORING?

757
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,300
YES.

758
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,100
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
JUST TO SCREW WITH ME.

759
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,400
YEAH.

760
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,700
WHY WOULD YOU EXPECT
ANYTHING ELSE?

761
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,300
I EXPECT HOUSE TO PULL
MY STRINGS.

762
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
I EXPECT CAMERON
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

763
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,200
I EXPECT THE NEW TEAM
TO KISS MY ASS.

764
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,900
AND I EXPECT YOU TO BE HONEST,

765
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
'CAUSE YOU DON'T GIVE
A CRAP.

766
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,700
YES, YOU'RE BORING.

767
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,900
THAT SPEECH WAS BORING.

768
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,400
THANKS SO MUCH.

769
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,700
YOU DON'T LET OTHER PEOPLE'S
PROBLEMS AFFECT YOU.

770
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,000
<i>YOU DON'T LET YOUR OWN</i>

771
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,700
PROBLEMS AFFECT YOU.

772
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,000
AND IT'S THE SCREW-UPS
THAT MAKE US INTERESTING.

773
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,500
<i>YOU'RE NEVER OUT OF CONTROL.</i>

774
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,300
<i>WHICH IS GOOD, AND...</i>

775
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,200
BORING.

776
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,500
NEVER LOSING CONTROL
ALSO MEANS

777
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,600
YOU'RE NEVER PUTTING YOURSELF
OUT THERE.

778
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,200
NEVER PUSHING YOUR LIMITS.

779
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,000
ON THE OTHER HAND,

780
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,600
YOU DO HAVE A TATTOO, SO...

781
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,300
MAYBE I'M WRONG.

782
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,200
* HALLELUJAH STOP AND STARE *

783
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,400
* WHEN WILL JESUS FIND US HERE *

784
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,800
* COULD WE *

785
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,500
* SURVIVE *

786
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,300
* HOW CAN YOU PRETEND TO KNOW *

787
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,400
* WHO YOU ARE *

788
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
* OR WHERE YOU WILL GO *

789
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,400
* WHEN YOU *

790
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,300
* JUST GET BY *

791
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,600
* AND DREAM *

792
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,400
* DREAMING ALL THE TIME *

793
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,500
* AWAY *

794
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,200
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

795
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,500
* AND DREAM *

796
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:03,100
* DREAMING ALL YOUR TIME *

797
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,800
* AWAY

798
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,300
SHE NEEDS
A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT.

799
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,900
TEST RESULTS ARE BACK?
WHAT'S SHE POSITIVE FOR?

800
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,000
NOTHING.

801
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,400
BUT WE'VE GOT A DONOR MATCH.

802
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,600
JUMPING TO A TRANSPLANT

803
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,400
WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE-

804
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,000
I KNOW SHE HAS
A BLOOD DISORDER.

805
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,800
COULD BE PNH.

806
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,300
SHE NEEDS
A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT.

807
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,100
OR LEUKEMIA.

808
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,400
SHE NEEDS
A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT.

809
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,300
OR THALASSEMIA.

810
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,800
- SHE NEEDS A BONE MARROW-
- YEAH, I GET IT.

811
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
BUT SHE'LL NEVER SURVIVE

812
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,300
TOTAL BODY IRRADIATION.

813
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,800
SO WE DON'T RADIATE HER.

814
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,900
HER MARROW'S NEARLY WIPED OUT
ALREADY.

815
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,000
COUNTS ALMOST ZERO.

816
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
"ALMOST" BEING THE KEY WORD.

817
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,600
THE NEW MARROW WOULD ATTACK
THE OLD MARROW.

818
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,500
SHE'LL DIE
FROM GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST.

819
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,700
YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?

820
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,500
SHE TRUSTS YOU.

821
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,300
GO GET HER CONSENT.

822
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,900
SOMETIMES I FIND OUT THINGS
YOU'D RATHER NOT KNOW.

823
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,600
<i>THIS WAS IN HIS TRASH.</i>

824
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,000
HE'S USING.

825
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,900
YOU'RE BACK.

826
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,300
GENIUS.

827
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,500
DAMN.

828
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,700
I KNEW THE FAKE WORKS
WAS TOO MUCH.

829
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,200
WELL, YOU HAD NO CHOICE.

830
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,500
WHERE WERE YOU GONNA GO

831
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
AFTER FAKE HOOKER GIRLFRIEND?

832
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,000
HOW DID YOU KNOW
HE WAS OUTSIDE?

833
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
CANE PRINTS.

834
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,200
I'M ACTUALLY
KIND OF INSULTED.

835
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,300
NO WAY I'M A DRUG ADDICT,

836
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,300
BUT YOU COMPLETELY BUY

837
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,200
THAT I FELL IN LOVE
WITH A PROSTITUTE?

838
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,600
YOU PLAYED TO YOUR STRENGTHS.

839
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,100
BY WHICH I MEAN YOU PLAYED
TO YOUR WEAKNESSES.

840
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,700
OH, MY GOD.

841
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,600
YOU INVOKED YOUR DEAD
GIRLFRIEND'S NAME TO SELL ME.

842
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
YOU'RE MY HERO.

843
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,600
BEST $30 I EVER SPENT.

844
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,900
IT'S 30?
DID YOU KEEP HER NUMBER?

845
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,400
UNFORTUNATELY, I KILLED HER

846
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,000
AND BURIED HER IN THE BASEMENT.

847
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,000
SHAME.

848
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,400
HUNGRY?

849
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,000
YEAH.

850
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,600
SO, SERIOUSLY.

851
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,600
WHERE WERE YOU
THE OTHER MORNING?

852
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,300
UGH, DON'T MAKE ME
DO THIS AGAIN.

853
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,800
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU.

854
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,700
THEN TELL ME.

855
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
WE'RE GOING BOWLING ON MONDAY.

856
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,100
<i>I'M COMING OVER
TO PLAY POKER THIS WEEKEND.</i>

857
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,500
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

858
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,700
YOU HAVE TO TRUST THAT.

859
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,800
OKAY.

860
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,300
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP FOLLOWING ME,
AREN'T YOU?

861
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,700
IT'S WHAT WE DO.

862
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,700
BE OUTSIDE MY APARTMENT
AT 8:00 TONIGHT.

863
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,900
SHE SAID YES
TO THE TRANSPLANT.

864
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,300
GOOD.

865
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,300
YOU'RE IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL
OF DESTRUCTION.

866
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,200
I CAN STOP.

867
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,300
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP SPIRALING.

868
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,700
KEEP SCREWING AROUND.

869
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,300
KEEP SLASHING AWAY
AT EVERY PERSON

870
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,300
WHO TRIES TO HELP UNTIL NO ONE
TRIES TO HELP ANYMORE.

871
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
TILL YOU HIT BOTTOM.
TILL YOU'RE DEAD.

872
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,600
UNTIL THEN...

873
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
I CAN USE YOU.

874
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,800
YOU'RE HIRING ME BACK?

875
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,500
YOU DID GOOD WORK.

876
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,000
I DID GOOD WORK YESTERDAY,

877
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,300
AND I WAS STILL FIRED.

878
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,300
WHAT CHANGED?

879
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,900
YOU WANTED ME TO SPEND TIME
WITH HER.

880
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,000
SEE IF I COULD STILL MAKE
A CONNECTION.

881
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,700
YOU CONNECTED WITH A DIAGNOSIS,
NOT WITH HER.

882
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,800
YOU'RE TRYING TO SAVE ME,

883
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,300
<i>TRYING TO CONTROL ME.</i>

884
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,300
<i>YOU'RE DOING EXACTLY</i>

885
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,400
<i>- WHAT YOU THINK-
- CRACKS.</i>

886
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,600
YOU'RE LIPS ARE CRACKED.

887
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
YOU BEEN USING
YOUR INHALER LATELY?

888
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,900
ALLERGIES.

889
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:41,900
DON'T DEFLECT.

890
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,200
<i>YOU ALWAYS DEFLECT.</i>

891
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,100
DID SHE CRY?

892
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,800
WHEN YOU TOLD HER
THAT SHE WAS GONNA DIE,

893
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,400
DID SHE CRY?

894
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,300
SHE... GOT UPSET. SHE-

895
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,400
WERE THERE TEARS?

896
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
NO.

897
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,800
CHOPPING AN ONION

898
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,700
RELEASES A MIST
OF SYN-PROPANETHIAL-S-OXIDE,

899
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,800
A CHEMICAL IRRITANT
WHICH CAUSES PEOPLE

900
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,500
TO HAVE A VERY PREDICTABLE
REACTION.

901
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,400
SHE HAS NO TEARS.

902
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,300
<i>IT WAS EITHER THIS
OR PUT ON BRIAN'S SONG.</i>

903
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,200
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO STOP BY WILSON'S.

904
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,200
SHE HAS SJOGREN'S.

905
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,900
IT ATTACKS THE GLANDS

906
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,900
THAT PRODUCE TEARS
AND SALIVA.

907
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,200
<i>ALSO, BY THE WAY,</i>

908
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,300
CAUSES LUNG CYSTS AND RTA.

909
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,000
IT DOESN'T CAUSE BLEEDING.

910
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,300
IT'S LIKE YOU AND MEN.

911
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,100
JUST 'CAUSE YOU USUALLY DON'T,

912
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,100
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T.

913
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,000
AND IT DOESN'T CAUSE
CRACKED LIPS

914
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
IN OTHER PEOPLE.

915
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,600
LACK OF SPIT MAKES HER MOUTH

916
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,200
A BREEDING GROUND
FOR A FUNGUS LIKE CANDIDA.

917
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,700
YOUR ASTHMA INHALER
DID THE SAME FOR YOU.

918
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,400
WIPED OUT YOUR MOUTH'S
IMMUNE SYSTEM.

919
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,200
SO SHE'S GOT WHAT I'VE GOT.

920
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,400
JUST THE OPPORTUNISTIC
INFECTION,

921
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,100
<i>NOT THE UNDERLYING CONDITION.</i>

922
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,500
ANOTHER LIFE SAVED
BY GIRL-ON-GIRL ACTION.

923
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,000
I'M GONNA BE OKAY?

924
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,000
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

925
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,300
METHYLPREDNISOLONE

926
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,700
<i>TO GET THE SJOGREN'S
UNDER CONTROL.</i>

927
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,400
AND SOME ARTIFICIAL TEARS

928
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,100
TO MAXIMIZE THE VISUAL IMPACT
OF THIS MOMENT.

929
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,800
SPENCER'S GONNA BE FINE.

930
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,700
AND I HEAR YOU GOT
YOUR JOB BACK.

931
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,400
I'M GONNA KEEP STANDING HERE
UNTIL YOU SAY SOMETHING.

932
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,200
I FEEL ALONE.

933
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,800
AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE.

934
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,200
SHE GETS TO LIVE.

935
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,600
I'M GONNA GO HOME.

936
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,900
I'M TIRED.

937
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

938
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,500
OH, MY GOD!

939
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,900
YOU GUYS SHOP HERE TOO?

940
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,700
BEST NIPPLES IN PRINCETON.

941
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,400
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

942
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,100
BECAUSE HE ATE THE DONUT.

943
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,500
I'M SO SORRY.

944
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,600
HE MUST'VE FOLLOWED ME.

945
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,700
I'M SURE.

946
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,800
WELL, YOU'RE CLEARLY
NOT PREGNANT,

947
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,900
SO EITHER YOU'RE BUYING THIS
AS A GIFT,

948
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,600
OR THIS IS SOME KIND OF WEIRD

949
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,900
"IF YOU BUILD IT,
THEY WILL COME" MOMENT.

950
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,400
I'M ADOPTING A BABY.

951
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,700
SHE ASKED ME TO BE
A CHARACTER REFERENCE.

952
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,400
THAT'S WHERE I WAS
THE OTHER MORNING.

953
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:21,900
I'M SORRY.

954
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,000
I COULDN'T BETRAY
HER CONFIDENCE.

955
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,000
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE ELSE
TO KNOW

956
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,100
IN CASE I DIDN'T GET
APPROVED.

957
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,300
TODAY, I DID.

958
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,700
<i>* IT'S A DARK ROAD *</i>

959
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,800
* AND A DARK WAY THAT LEADS *

960
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,900
* TO MY HOUSE *

961
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,300
* AND THE WORD SAYS *

962
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,600
* YOU'RE NEVER GONNA FIND ME
THERE *

963
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:42,800
* OH NO *

964
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,900
ARE YOU GONNA CONGRATULATE ME?

965
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,200
IF YOU'RE HAPPY, I'M...

966
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,300
* IT DIDN'T GET THERE *

967
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,600
* BY ITSELF *

968
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,300
* THERE'S A FEELING,
BUT YOU'RE NOT FEELING IT *

969
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,100
* AT ALL *

970
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,400
* THERE'S A MEANING *

971
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,800
* BUT YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
ANYMORE...
