1
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Excuse me.

2
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,700
I've been waiting here
for over an hour.

3
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,200
All I need is a refill
on my migraine medication.

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,400
We'll get to you
as soon as we can.

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,800
You can get to me now.

6
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,200
It'll only take you
two minutes.

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,800
You're not an emergency.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
This isn't
an emergency room.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,000
And it's not gonna go
any faster

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,400
By pissing me off.

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
- Got a minute?
- No.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,400
A routine checkup can wait.
What else you got?

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm consulting
on some clinical trials

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,500
That involve
C.N.S. Compounds.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,600
While it's true
that no sometimes means yes,

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,400
In this context...

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
One's a new Huntington's drug.

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,500
Phase three trials
are showing real results

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,200
Delaying neuronal
degeneration.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,200
I can probably get you in.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
No, thanks.

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,200
Are you doing anything
about your disease,

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Following any kind
of program?

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,300
No. Nor am I looking
for a consult.

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,300
Lisa cuddy, M.D.
Dean of medicine

26
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,000
Excuse me, I'm looking
for dr. Cuddy.

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,100
Well, she's either not here,
or she's under the desk.

28
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,300
<i>Either way, you're gonna have
to wait outside</i>

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,600
Until I'm finished.

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Do you know when
she'll be back?

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,400
Yes, which is why
I need you to get out

32
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,700
And leave me alone.

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,800
Sorry.

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,500
<i>Nice try.</i>

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,700
Love to help.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,900
Shut up!

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,700
You wanted to see doctor-

38
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,200
I said shut up.

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,400
I'm sick,
and I want to know why.

40
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,700
I want the best doctor
in this hospital here, now...

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,300
Or I'm gonna start
killing people.

42
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,300
What seems to be
the problem?

43
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,100
Close those blinds.

44
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,500
<i>You, push the sofa
in front of that door.</i>

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,900
<i>You, move that table
in front of the other door.</i>

46
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,400
Now!

47
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,500
- Okay,
- Okay.

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Just move it.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,700
You know, you don't have
to point the gun man.

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,100
We're gonna do
whatever you want.

51
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
No, we're not.

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
House...

53
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,300
That's a bathroom
you're barricading.

54
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,300
<i>It might come in handy,</i>

55
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,900
Especially since
you've cleverly decided

56
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,900
To take a bunch
of sick people hostage.

57
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,000
Do it!

58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,300
My medical records.
I need you to read them.

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,800
<i>You really think that
reenacting dog day afternoon</i>

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,500
Is the best way
to get diagnosed?

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,100
<i>I'm sure you've been waiting
for hours</i>

62
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,300
<i>In an uncomfortable chair,</i>

63
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,700
But you should watch the movie
all the way through.

64
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,000
I've been to 16 doctors
in the last two years.

65
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Had three full-Body cts

66
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
And two mris,

67
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,700
Seven blood panels,
and one homeopathic consult.

68
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,700
<i>And all that was missing</i>

69
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,000
Was the threat of violence.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,100
<i>What's missing is an answer!</i>

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,900
I can't breathe!

72
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,100
I'm tired...
all the time.

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,900
I get skin rashes,
and heart palpitations,

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,300
And insomnia.

75
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,100
That's a cool constellation
of symptoms.

76
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,200
It could be
something minor.

77
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,900
At least compared to life
in prison,

78
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,100
Which is what you seem
to prefer

79
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,500
To seeing
16 more specialists.

80
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,100
Shut up and do your job.

81
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,800
You barely looked
at the file.

82
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,600
No need.

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,900
Symptoms...

84
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Those are the things
you keep whining about.

85
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,500
Tests-Negative,
or you wouldn't be here.

86
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,800
History-Shy, quiet kid.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,900
Kept to himself.

88
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,400
Collected comic books
and missing children.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,300
Excuse me, my wife feels sick
to her stomach.

90
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,600
Next time pack some heat,
and maybe we'll look into it.

91
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,500
I'll be okay.

92
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,600
If you ask me,

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,400
Keeping an open line
of communication

94
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,300
Is the best way
to resolve conflict.

95
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,900
What kind of breathing
problems?

96
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,200
Shortness of breath.

97
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,300
And sharp pain
when I inhale.

98
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,000
So you figured
your wife left you

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
Because you couldn't breathe,
right?

100
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,700
Me, I rarely
kidnap someone

101
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,600
Unless I've got
a serious health problem.

102
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,300
<i>Since you're not almost dead,
it means you're armed</i>

103
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,300
Because you're blaming something
other than your health

104
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,400
On your health.

105
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,500
I've never been married.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,100
Got a match?

107
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,700
Why?

108
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,200
Because I'd rather not
stand here

109
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,100
While you try and negotiate
a hostage trade

110
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,500
For an incentive spirometer.

111
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,800
- I'll look in cuddy's desk.
- Stay out of the desk!

112
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,400
<i>Cuddy doesn't smoke.</i>

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,100
But he does.

114
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,600
- No, I-I don't.
- Right.

115
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,900
You just brush your teeth
with coffee grounds.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,500
Look, sir, I've never smoked
in my life, okay?

117
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,300
Jerk.

118
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,500
Hey!

119
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
You figure that two people
snuck weapons

120
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,700
Into the clinic today?

121
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,100
<i>I'm sorry.
It's just...</i>

122
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,400
I got a lighter.

123
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,400
Slowly.

124
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,800
Hold it out
as far as you can.

125
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,900
Try to blow it out.

126
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,300
Decreased lung volume.

127
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,400
Heart palpitations,
fatigue, stomach pain.

128
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,100
An intermittent rash-
Could be 100 things.

129
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,500
If you add on
that final symptom,

130
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,900
It can only be
pulmonary scleroderma.

131
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,100
What final symptom?
Those were all my symptoms.

132
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Last one is the 16 doctors
who missed it.

133
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,800
Simple alkylating agent,
case solved.

134
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,200
See you on visitor's day.

135
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,700
Crime scene!

136
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,400
House,
what's going on in there?

137
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,500
<i>- Is everyone all right?
- About to be.</i>

138
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,800
Assuming he's not lying.

139
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,000
But he seems like
a pretty straight arrow to me.

140
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,900
I'm gonna need
some propofol

141
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,500
To prove that it's
pulmonary scleroderma.

142
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
<i>Then we all get
to go home.</i>

143
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,600
Propofol?

144
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,300
<i>- You sure
- Have one of the guards bring it in.</i>

145
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,200
No, no guards.
No cops.

146
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,200
Uh, I'll go get it.

147
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,400
No one's leaving.

148
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,900
She's not a cop?

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Dr. Cuddy brings in
the drugs.

150
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,000
Alone.

151
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,500
She might be armed.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,700
I'd have her deliver it
shirtless.

153
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,800
Who is it?

154
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,100
Oh, god, House.

155
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,000
Maybe we should wait for-

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,500
Guys
with even bigger guns?

157
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,700
Who know how to talk
to armed-

158
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,400
<i>Say good-Bye
or I shoot her.</i>

159
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,800
Roll up your sleeve.

160
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,700
Give it to someone else first.

161
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,100
You're the only one
who needs it.

162
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,200
Give it to someone else.

163
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,300
If it goes in okay,

164
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,000
You can give
a second dose to me.

165
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,300
<i>I don't care who.</i>

166
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,500
Just pick someone.

167
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,300
Again, had your brilliant plan
included a roomful of hostages

168
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,900
That don't have fetuses,
bacterial and fungal infections,

169
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,600
<i>Leaving their immune systems
too week to deal</i>

170
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
<i>With the metabolic strain,</i>

171
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,300
Or are already
on pain killers

172
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,300
That have fatal interactions...

173
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,900
He's not on pain killers.

174
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,600
I heard him tell her
in the clinic.

175
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
Aw, come on, man.

176
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,700
<i>Don't take it out
on us.</i>

177
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,100
You got a problem
with doctors?

178
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,400
Take it out
on the doctors.

179
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,200
Give it to her.

180
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,900
She's sick.

181
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,900
You are a very large creep.

182
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Take off your shirt.

183
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,100
Satisfied?

184
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,700
Fine.

185
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,700
Roll up your sleeve.

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,400
You think I'm an idiot?!

187
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,800
Huh?!
That's what you think?!

188
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,100
I thought I had
a little more time

189
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,500
With a guy that size.

190
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,500
You're not gonna do
anything.

191
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,400
You still need me.

192
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,600
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Come on!

193
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,400
What are you doing?
He didn't do anything.

194
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,900
You're right.
I need you.

195
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,900
I also need you to know
you can't screw with me.

196
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,300
It's for you.

197
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,500
Lieutenant bowman,
princeton swat.

198
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,500
Dr. Lisa cuddy,
dean of medicine.

199
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,600
We just heard a gunshot,

200
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,500
But I haven't been able
to make contact.

201
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,600
We'll handle that
once we secure our perimeter

202
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,900
And set up
our positions.

203
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,300
By "perimeters,"
I assume you mean snipers?

204
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,800
We have to put an end
to this.

205
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
Got a husband in there
or a loved one?

206
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,800
Uh, no.

207
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,300
Don't worry, we'll decide
when to start shooting.

208
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,700
House is gonna get
someone killed.

209
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,700
The guy's ready to kill
for a diagnosis,

210
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,800
I can't think
of a better doctor

211
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,200
To be trapped in there
with him.

212
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,000
How 'bout someone
who's not gonna

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,500
Keep pushing
the whack job's buttons

214
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,800
Until he cracks?

215
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,300
It's House.

216
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
<i>- Joe's bar and grill.
- It's foreman,</i>

217
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,700
And every fellow you've had
in the last five years.

218
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,800
What causes
low lung volume,

219
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,600
<i>Heart palpitations, fatigue,
stomach pain,</i>

220
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,300
<i>Insomnia, and a rash?</i>

221
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,500
This is pathetic.

222
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,600
<i>If I strap a bomb
to my chest,</i>

223
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,800
Do I get seven doctors
attending to me?

224
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,700
Dr. Robert chase.

225
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,700
On the off chance you have
some brilliant escape plan

226
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
And are the vengeful type.

227
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,200
<i>Do you think he's
the only guy in new jersey</i>

228
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,400
With an unsolved illness
and a pistol?

229
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
I'm not playing this game.

230
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,000
Seriously?
You're walking out?

231
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,400
<i>No, he's just kidding.
He's right here.</i>

232
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Throw me that marker,
will you?

233
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,600
<i>Chest pain,
the lung problems,</i>

234
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,700
Fatigue, rash.

235
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,500
<i>Sounds like chronic
lung infection.</i>

236
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,100
<i>Heart palpitations
and fatigue-</i>

237
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,900
<i>Could be a cancer
that's spread from the lungs.</i>

238
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,200
Next!

239
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,700
If his diaphragm's
not working,

240
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,200
<i>Maybe his nerves
are freezing up.</i>

241
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I think he's going
into shock.

242
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,000
???

243
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,900
Guys with guns go first.

244
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,500
<i>Next!</i>

245
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,200
The shortest distance between
stomach pain and insomnia

246
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,400
<i>Is bad circulation.</i>

247
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,800
<i>Plus troubled breathing.
Could be a heart defect.</i>

248
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
You needed to write
four things down to remember 'em?

249
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,800
It's not my wall.

250
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,700
You're gonna get
some special deliveries.

251
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,400
<i>Foreman,
we're gonna draw blood.</i>

252
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,800
<i>Run tests for infection
and cancer.</i>

253
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,800
<i>Cameron, comb through
his medical records.</i>

254
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,400
See if any of his past
900 medications

255
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,700
Could have screwed up
his heart.

256
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,500
<i>Taub and kutner,</i>

257
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,100
Go to his apartment,

258
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,400
Check for neurotoxins.

259
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,900
873 marshall,
south brunswick.

260
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,700
Back window's unlocked.

261
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,400
Giving out your address.

262
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,100
Clearly you're not going
back there.

263
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,200
Means you do have
an end game.

264
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I'm lieutenant bowman.

265
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,000
How's everyone doing
in there?

266
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,400
Got one lower limb
flesh wound,

267
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,100
Another guy unconscious.

268
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,100
Unfortunately,
not the guy we hoped.

269
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,300
We're gonna need someone
to deliver his blood.

270
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,300
It's gonna be hard
to play doctor-

271
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,400
Shut up.

272
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,600
Open that blind.

273
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,100
<i>Just a few inches.</i>

274
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,400
- Why me?
- Just open it. Open it!

275
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,900
Why me? Anyone can do it.
Why pick me?

276
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,600
Get back!
Get back!

277
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,000
I will kill her

278
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,200
<i>Unless you back the hell
out of there now!</i>

279
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,100
Interesting.

280
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Anybody else hear those guys
outside?

281
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
<i>Anybody?</i>

282
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,000
He's got hyperacusis.

283
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,100
What does that mean?

284
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,800
It means we have
a favorite.

285
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,500
It's nerve related.

286
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,200
<i>Amped-Up hearing
could be linked</i>

287
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,500
To nerve palsy.

288
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,800
Puff out your cheeks.
Come on.

289
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,800
Big mug shot smile.

290
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,100
Left side
facial weakness.

291
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,200
Seventh nerve palsy.

292
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,000
Plus intermittent
rashes.

293
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,200
Plus migraines.

294
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,500
It's post-Herpetic neuralgia.

295
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,600
Herpetic?
You think I have herpes?

296
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm not judging here.

297
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,500
This thing is just as likely
to be caused by chicken pox.

298
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,100
I need proof now.

299
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,300
There is a test.

300
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,000
It's dangerous and painful

301
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,600
While the treatment
is safe and painless.

302
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,300
But you make a good point.
You need proof now.

303
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,900
I'll order up the test.

304
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
If you have neuralgia,
you won't feel it going in.

305
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,800
It only hurts
if your diagnosis is wrong?

306
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,900
Win-Win.

307
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,200
Jason,

308
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,800
<i>Don't hang up the phone again.</i>

309
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,800
You're gonna send in...

310
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,700
Capsaicin.

311
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,300
<i>200 micrograms.</i>

312
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,000
And two syringes this time.

313
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,800
And we'll give you the blood
and his records.

314
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,500
<i>No more meds, jason,</i>

315
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,900
<i>And no deliveries
without something in return.</i>

316
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,000
You've gotta give us
a hostage.

317
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,700
You can have two.

318
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,000
<i>Great.</i>

319
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,400
<i>Then I'll send an officer
right in with the transfer.</i>

320
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,500
Everything gets brought in
by dr. Cuddy.

321
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,800
Jason, I'm not gonna let her
do that.

322
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,800
First-Don't use his name
so much.

323
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
<i>It doesn't sound reassuring,
it just sounds creepy.</i>

324
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,200
Second-Come on,
he's not gonna shoot

325
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,700
The one person he trusts
to bring in his medication.

326
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,800
<i>He's gonna shoot hostages
if she doesn't bring it in.</i>

327
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,600
I'll get back to you.

328
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,000
The guy's demanding that
you do all the transfers.

329
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay.

330
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,600
Okay?

331
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,300
What am I supposed to say?

332
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,000
You're supposed to say no.

333
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
It's not your job.

334
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
If you got a conflict here,

335
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,600
If you have stakes in this that
you're not telling me about,

336
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,000
Then I can't trust you.

337
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,100
Got it.
I'm okay.

338
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,600
Can you tell him
I'm coming in now?

339
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,700
Who's taking
the first dose?

340
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,600
Anybody here got a long-Standing
case of neuralgia

341
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,200
That's killed their nerves
so this won't hurt at all?

342
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,500
How bad does it hurt?

343
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,400
You're looking to be
the hero?

344
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,300
Well, I've been beaten up
a lot,

345
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
<i>And I can handle pain.</i>

346
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
How old are you?

347
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,500
The guy's got a gun.

348
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,800
I think that covers
the parental consent issue.

349
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,100
And that stuff
can also cause

350
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,600
Nerve
and muscle damage.

351
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,900
No way am I taking
that crap.

352
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,500
<i>- Come on.
- You have to.</i>

353
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,600
It's the rules.

354
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
I'll do it.

355
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,300
This is a level
of risk taking beyond anonymous
girl-On-Girl action.

356
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,200
They're patients.
I'm a doctor.

357
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,600
With a degenerative,
drug-Unfriendly illness.

358
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,800
Everything's not some
fascinating character flaw.

359
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,600
This is a genetic flaw.

360
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,900
This is your
Huntington's speaking.

361
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,100
This is you waving
a white flag at the world.

362
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,700
Yes, I have
a shortened lifespan.

363
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,200
Another reason why I'm
objectively the right choice.

364
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,900
I would have laid money
you had herpes.

365
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,100
Your turn.

366
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,600
So why are we here?

367
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,600
We've ruled out
immediate risk of death,

368
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,900
Lost love.

369
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,000
That just leaves...

370
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Work?

371
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,200
You're defined
by your work.

372
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,900
But you kept seeing doctors,
kept missing time.

373
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,200
Couldn't focus.

374
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,800
Maybe you made
a huge mistake...

375
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,900
Got fired.

376
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,400
I just want an answer.

377
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,700
I know.

378
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,700
I'm asking why.

379
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,400
Nerve paral

380
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,400
Guy knew he wasn't
coming back.

381
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Everything's laid out
for us.

382
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,700
I'll check for toxins
in the kitchen.

383
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,300
He must have $6,000, $7,000
in unpaid medical bills.

384
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,000
I've got debt too-You don't
see me acting like a lunatic.

385
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
<i>There's no excuse
for what he's doing,</i>

386
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,900
But you've got
millions of people

387
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,300
Thousands of dollars in debt
because they're sick-

388
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,500
At least one of them's
gonna do something inexcusable.

389
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,400
Especially if it works.

390
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,200
White blood cell count's
normal.

391
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,300
It's not infection.

392
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,800
Lung infection

393
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,300
So either his heart's
on the fritz,

394
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,300
Or he's got cancer.

395
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,500
Found a picture of his mom.

396
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,400
She's got a droopy eye,
fat face, thick neck.

397
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,900
Classic signs
of an upper-Lobe tumor.

398
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,800
<i>Or she's just ugly.</i>

399
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,700
There are also classic signs
of an adrenal problem.

400
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,800
<i>It's his heart.</i>

401
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,300
- You can't be sure what
- His neck. Distended jugular.

402
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,300
What are you doing?

403
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,100
I am going to try
to strangle you

404
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,900
Faster than you
can pull a trigger.

405
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,300
He needs to check your pulse.

406
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,800
It's racing. 160.

407
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,100
We need to get paddles.

408
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,500
Or maybe we could
just do nothing.

409
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,000
If I get any weaker...

410
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,300
<i>And they don't fix it...</i>

411
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,900
- I'll shoot... you!
- Don't.

412
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,200
<i>- He didn't mean to-
- Shut up!</i>

413
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,300
All of you.

414
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,100
What are-
What are you doing?

415
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,800
- What are you doing?!
- Carotid massage...

416
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,400
<i>Gotta slow your heart.</i>

417
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
<i>It's 200.</i>

418
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,000
<i>- Well, get the paddles.
- Uh-Uh.</i>

419
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,400
Whole point of those things is
to make your muscles contract.

420
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,200
They don't discriminate
against trigger fingers.

421
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,500
Nobody gets my gun.

422
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,800
- Send in paddles!
- Don't!

423
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,600
Get the damn paddles!

424
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
<i>Or I'll shoot you.</i>

425
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,800
Threatening to shoot the guy
who's diagnosing you

426
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,300
Makes a lot of sense.

427
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,000
Actually doing it,
not so much.

428
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,300
Give him your gun
so he can save you.

429
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,400
Just let him die.

430
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,700
<i>Bill, stop.</i>

431
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,300
We can cardiovert chemically.

432
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,000
If we don't know what kind
of heart rhythm it is-

433
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,500
If we don't try something,
he's gonna kill someone.

434
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
<i>- I'm gonna get the drugs.
- No one goes anywhere!</i>

435
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,000
<i>If she doesn't come back,</i>

436
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,100
???

437
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,700
You, come here.

438
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,300
All right...
30 seconds.

439
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,500
She's gonna go.

440
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,800
She's gonna come back.

441
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,100
<i>She should go.</i>

442
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
He'll kill him.

443
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,200
But not her.

444
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,400
That your version
of morality?

445
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,300
If you don't think your life is
worth more than someone else's,

446
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,100
Sign your donor card
and kill yourself.

447
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Shoot me.

448
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,800
- You really want-
- Yes.

449
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
No, no!
She just needs time!

450
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,900
<i>She just needs more time
to find the right-</i>

451
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,200
- The right drug-
- It's me.

452
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,700
She takes it first.

453
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,000
Adenosine slows the heart.

454
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Which is fine,
if it's beating fast like yours.

455
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Not fine if it's normal,
like hers.

456
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Following the math on this?

457
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,400
She takes everything
I take.

458
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't want anything
that cross-Reacts.

459
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,300
The martyr's heart is
beating dangerously slow.

460
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,500
Are we good to go?

461
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,600
Your heart's back to normal.

462
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,000
<i>No tachycardia.</i>

463
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,200
No sign of a heart defect
at all.

464
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
But you're sweating.

465
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,700
I nearly had a heart attack.

466
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,500
You're surprised
I'm sweating?

467
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,600
On one side of your face,
but not the other.

468
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
What does that mean?

469
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,600
A tumor is pressing
on your sympathetic nerves.

470
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,100
You have lung cancer.

471
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,300
Pulse is down below 50.

472
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,700
So's her I.Q.

473
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,100
Help her up.

474
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,600
Get her heart going faster.

475
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,100
I need proof it's cancer.

476
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,600
Of course you do!

477
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,500
It's gotta be
a pancoast tumor.

478
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,000
<i>Patient's got dyspnea,</i>

479
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,200
Seventh-Nerve palsy.

480
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,100
He's sweating on one side
of his face.

481
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,400
Everything okay in there?

482
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,700
Take your time.

483
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,600
It's not like I've got a gun
to my head.

484
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,500
Lung cancer usually shows up
lower than the seventh nerve.

485
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,900
<i>Did you check his throat?</i>

486
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,400
Spit on the floor.

487
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,400
What?

488
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,100
If I do it,
I can't tell cuddy

489
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,200
That it was
medically necessary.

490
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,300
I'm gonna ask you to piss
on her chair next.

491
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Dry mouth.

492
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,600
<i>His parotid glands
aren't working.</i>

493
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,500
It there's swelling,
it's a pancoast tumor

494
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,000
That's metastasized.

495
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,700
Feel that.
Right there.

496
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,400
If it's cancer,
there must be a test.

497
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
You just did it.

498
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,100
What about an x-Ray
or something?

499
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,100
Good idea.

500
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh, damn.

501
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,500
I left my ct machine
in my other pants.

502
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,900
How many hostages
do you think it would cost me

503
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,500
For a trip to radiology?

504
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,900
So...

505
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,300
What made you snap?

506
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,700
- Hmos?
- Shut up.

507
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,900
Nah, you saw 16 doctors.

508
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,900
How bad could they
have been?

509
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,900
Shut up!

510
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Humiliation?

511
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,800
Doctors treating you
like a piece of meat?

512
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,000
Too many fingers and tubes
up your holes.

513
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,100
You hate doctors.
You want to take back control.

514
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,300
If so, I apologize
for the fact that

515
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,900
<i>You are a piece of meat.</i>

516
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,500
I just want an answer.

517
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
That's all.

518
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Everyone stays in here
with me.

519
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,100
If you need anything
from in there, get it now.

520
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,600
Move around.

521
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,100
Anyone moves... I fire.

522
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,800
That's not all.

523
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,700
Curiosity's not enough.

524
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,500
There's gotta be
a deeper reason.

525
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
You never did anything

526
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,300
Just because
you had to know?

527
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,300
Never shot anyone.

528
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,200
You're not me.

529
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,200
This is my body.

530
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,400
This is my life.

531
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,100
And there's a truth
out there.

532
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,100
I'd rather rot
in jail knowing than...

533
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
I can't handle not knowing.

534
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Yeah.

535
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,200
Hold that.

536
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,900
You want your answer,
you gotta give me the gun.

537
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,700
What's this?

538
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
<i>Starburst artifact.</i>

539
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,400
The metal from the gun
is ruining the image.

540
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,900
Show him.

541
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
Starburst.

542
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,200
Now, unless you think
we pre-Arranged that,

543
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,700
Just in case
we were ever held hostage

544
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,700
By a guy who needs
a ct,

545
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,100
We're not lying.

546
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,800
So you have two choices.

547
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,800
You can give me the gun
and get your answer.

548
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,600
Or you can shoot me.

549
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,300
I'm not gonna give you
the gun.

550
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,500
Why did he release you?

551
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,100
House got him
to give up his gun.

552
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
We just ran.

553
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,100
Why are you still here?

554
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Curious.

555
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,000
It's safe now, right?

556
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,800
They're gonna be
through that door any moment.

557
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,300
Just show me the tumor.

558
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,500
There isn't one.

559
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,400
I don't know
what you have.

560
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,500
So...

561
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,000
It's over.

562
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,100
Thanks for trying.

563
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,400
You had four theories.

564
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,800
You ruled out four theories.

565
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,700
Maybe no one can cure me.

566
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,400
He overpowered me
and got the gun back.

567
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,100
You're a coward.

568
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,000
<i>You need to know everything</i>

569
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,300
Because you're afraid
to be wrong.

570
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,800
You're so afraid
of being ordinary,

571
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,200
Of being
just another doctor,

572
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,600
Just another human being,

573
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,500
That you'll risk
other people's lives.

574
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm arrogant.
You're the coward.

575
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,600
<i>You're terrified
of death.</i>

576
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,200
You just want to cheat it
by making it come sooner.

577
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,000
Gives you the illusion
of control.

578
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Can I go?

579
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,100
Sorry.
We might need you.

580
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,200
How do they expect me
to think?

581
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,500
Is he lying?

582
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,800
Why would he do that?

583
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,400
Over time, hostages
start to root for the captor.

584
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,000
House isn't the rooting kind.

585
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,800
No, he's the obsessive,
defiant kind.

586
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
Mic the door.

587
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,800
Get a frame charge.

588
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,200
I hope your boyfriend knows
what he's doing.

589
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,300
Are you insane?

590
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,600
He's quick
for a sick guy.

591
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,900
Dyspnea,

592
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,400
<i>Anemia,
seventh-Nerve palsy,</i>

593
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,800
Tachycardia.

594
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,900
Long passes.
Anything.

595
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,500
<i>- Go.
- I don't believe it.</i>

596
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,400
Chase was right.
You're gonna kill someone.

597
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,000
I don't want to be
a part of it.

598
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,900
Loa loa filariasis.

599
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,200
You ever been to cameroon

600
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,100
<i>Or on the ogowe river?</i>

601
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,200
Next.

602
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,600
Could be q fever if he's had
exposure to goats.

603
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,000
No goats.

604
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,900
<i>Histiocytosis x</i>

605
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,900
Explains
the lung involvement and-

606
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,900
We have a new symptom.

607
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,400
He is turning his head,
favoring his left ear.

608
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,000
Means he's partially deaf
in the right.

609
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,500
Three hours ago,
he had superhero hearing.

610
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,600
<i>Cushing's causes fatigue,
breathing problems,</i>

611
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,700
Fluctuating hearing.

612
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,500
Even increased aggression
and risk-Taking.

613
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,700
I'm doing this by choice.
It's not a symptom.

614
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,100
We'll keep that between us
till you talk to your lawyer.

615
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,400
I need dexamethasone

616
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,900
And enough time to provoke
a respiratory reaction

617
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,400
And confirm
cushing's syndrome.

618
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,800
<i>You need more time?</i>

619
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,500
<i>House, we're not negotiating
with you.</i>

620
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,700
Actually,
we're through negotiating.

621
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,200
I've still got
three hostages left.

622
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,900
I'll give you one.

623
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,300
<i>And no more testing drugs
on a sick doctor.</i>

624
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,200
Fine.

625
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,900
Send in the drugs.

626
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,100
Son, come here,
come here.

627
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,800
House, you can't-

628
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,500
If you have cushing's,
this will slow your breathing.

629
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,100
<i>Give it to her first.</i>

630
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,600
Those were not the terms.

631
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,800
I lied.

632
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,100
These drugs
could be fake.

633
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Why would I do that?
I gave you back the gun!

634
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
You wouldn't.
They would.

635
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,100
She has Huntington's.

636
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,300
If these drugs are real,
it could screw up her liver.

637
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,500
Chances are slim.

638
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,000
Chances of him shooting
one of us,

639
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,900
- On the other hand-
- Don't do-

640
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,000
How long do you have
to live?

641
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,300
Eight, ten years.

642
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,300
Killing her is your chance
to get personal?

643
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,300
Huntington's
doesn't have-

644
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,000
Doesn't have a cure?

645
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
No.

646
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,000
So if we get
out of here-

647
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,400
If she were clinging
to hope,

648
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,600
She wouldn't be
standing in line

649
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,700
Waiting for you
to order up more drugs.

650
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,900
Take a deep breath.

651
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,200
Not knowing what was wrong
with me...

652
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,500
Made me miserable.

653
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,500
Maybe that's insane.

654
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,800
Doing this... yeah.

655
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,000
Insane.

656
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,000
But I had something
to gain.

657
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,900
You can't take risks
with no upside at all.

658
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,300
I can't decide
which is riskier,

659
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,300
Taking crazy risks

660
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,000
Or taking advice
on crazy risks

661
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
From a crazed risk-Taker.

662
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,700
Heart's racing.

663
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,800
Fever.

664
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,600
And your breathing's
unchanged.

665
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,500
That means...

666
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Means I was wrong.

667
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,600
Her kidneys are shutting down

668
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,500
Because of the meds
you made her take.

669
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,600
We have to get her
out of here.

670
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,500
The dexamethasone is making
Thirteen's kidneys fail,

671
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,100
But not the patient's--
Why?

672
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,800
This guy's been
on 50 different medications.

673
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,900
<i>Maybe his kidneys
should be failing,</i>

674
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,200
<i>But something's
protecting them.</i>

675
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,000
I need to slap you.

676
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,200
For diagnostic purposes.

677
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:56,900
Seriously.

678
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,900
If I was jerking you around,

679
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,000
I'd say I needed to kick you
in the groin.

680
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,800
That twitch

681
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,300
Is chvostek's sign.

682
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,300
Don't ask me how chvostek
discovered it.

683
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,200
He has calcium deficiency.

684
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,700
<i>Drugs that block calcium</i>

685
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,300
<i>Tend to shield
against kidney damage.</i>

686
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,600
He's been on protein pump
inhibitors for years

687
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,500
<i>For his stomach pain.</i>

688
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,900
Those drugs have been protecting
his kidneys for years.

689
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,700
He has something that has
a long incubation period.

690
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,500
Something that should have
wrecked his kidneys.

691
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,600
<i>Something that explains
breathing problems,</i>

692
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,400
Heart problems,
jumpy nerves,

693
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,900
And weak blood.

694
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,500
Leishmaniasis.

695
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,500
<i>Would make perfect sense</i>

696
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,700
If our patient was
an arabian bedouin.

697
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,100
Melioidosis.

698
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,100
<i>Bacteria gets into the lungs,
spreads to the heart.</i>

699
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,900
<i>It explains everything.</i>

700
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,400
Except that if you read
the history,

701
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,700
You'd know that our patient
has never been

702
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,900
To a tropical climate!

703
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,800
<i>Is he absolutely sure of that?</i>

704
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,200
<i>Mexico. Costa rica.</i>

705
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,100
You've never been-

706
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,200
I've never been anywhere
south of florida.

707
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,300
You idiot.

708
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,200
Florida counts?

709
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,000
Well, not to
the supreme court.

710
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,400
But it's warm enough
for germs.

711
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,900
You keep blaming doctors

712
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,600
When you can't even give
a halfway decent history.

713
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,300
Negotiation's over.

714
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,400
It will be as soon as you get us
three grams of ceftazidime.

715
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,900
<i>He comes out, he gets
all the medicine he wants.</i>

716
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,700
You can have dr. House.

717
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,200
Why are you getting rid of me?

718
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,400
I need to trade you
for the answer.

719
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,800
You're gonna give her
the meds.

720
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,900
No...

721
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,800
Come on, give 'em to me
instead.

722
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,100
She's taken everything
I've taken.

723
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,400
The combination of meds
could knock me out.

724
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,900
Her kidneys are failing.

725
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,100
You give her those drugs,

726
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,400
She'll be dead by the time
they get the cuffs on you.

727
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,500
I need my answer.

728
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,000
Your obsession
is gonna kill her!

729
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,600
Your obsession
gave me back the gun!

730
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,800
It is pointless
to give her those drugs.

731
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
Even if they are
screwing with you,

732
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,200
This is your last diagnosis.

733
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,600
Only if you're right.

734
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,300
House,
get out of here.

735
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,300
Shut up.
I'm not leaving.

736
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,600
Who's the martyr now?

737
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,200
<i>Either the drugs kill me</i>

738
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Or he kills me.

739
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,100
Doesn't seem to make
a lot of difference.

740
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,300
You really don't feel bad
about killing me?

741
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,000
Not if you don't feel bad
about killing yourself.

742
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,400
I don't want to die.

743
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,500
Yeah, you do.

744
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,900
You just don't have the nerve
to actually do it.

745
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,700
<i>You just want it
out of your control.</i>

746
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,300
Well, it is.

747
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,900
'Cause I've got a gun.

748
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,800
Don't do this.

749
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,900
Either I do this
with you alive, or...

750
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,000
<i>Please.</i>

751
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,600
Sometimes you just have
to trust people.

752
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,800
<i>Please.</i>

753
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,600
I don't want to die!

754
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,500
I don't want to die!

755
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,800
Why are you still alive?

756
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,500
He didn't make me take it.

757
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,300
A week of temporary dialysis,
your kidneys will be okay.

758
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
I'm sorry I backed out
of the differential.

759
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,800
About that Huntington's
drug trial...

760
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
Test confirmed
melioidosis.

761
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,000
Easy to miss
on a stain.

762
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,800
Scans and X-rays
vary widely.

763
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,200
Is that all
you care about?

764
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,300
A moron storms the clinic,

765
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,600
Bullies his way
into life without parole,

766
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,500
You enabling him
every step.

767
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,000
If he hadn't done
what he did,

768
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,500
He'd be dead.

769
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,700
<i>Good thing you enabled
my every medical move.</i>

770
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,000
You think I handled this
differently because you were in here?

771
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,000
I don't know.

772
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,700
Let's try it again
without me.

773
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,700
This is why you and I
can't be a... thing.

774
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,300
If you're suggesting
that you screwed up

775
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,200
Because of a non-Relationship
with me,

776
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,300
I don't know how
I can help you.

777
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,100
'Cause the only change
you can make

778
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,500
From a non-Relationship is...

779
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,600
<i>You want a relationship?</i>

780
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,500
God, no.

781
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,100
Just trying to follow
your logic.
