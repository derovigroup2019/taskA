Life's meaningless

530
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:33,618
Cancer?

531
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:34,819
<i>(Taub)</i>
<i>Imaging studies</i>

532
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:35,887
<i>Have been clear</i>
<i>for tumors.</i>

533
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:37,455
Then that leaves infection.

534
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:39,157
He'd be brimming
with white blood cells.

535
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:40,492
<i>(House) Or we are</i>
<i>at the backstage door</i>

536
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,961
of a Duran Duran concert.

537
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:44,696
<i>Hundreds of screaming girls</i>

538
00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:45,964
clustered around.

539
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:47,165
What does that mean?

540
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:48,667
That girls like rock bands.

541
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:49,868
The presence of the fans

542
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,636
indicates the presence
of the band.

543
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:52,637
Different night--

544
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:55,206
<i>same band, same door.</i>

545
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,242
Now there's not a girl in sight.
What does that mean?

546
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,411
Sorry, I don't speak hair band.

547
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:00,779
They weren't a hair band.
They were new romantics.

548
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:01,980
The band already left?

549
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:03,448
Nope, the band's still there,

550
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:04,983
still rocking out.

551
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:07,085
The absence <i>of the fans</i>

552
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:08,953
not indicate the absence of the band?

553
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:13,758
When it's 2009.

554
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:14,893
<i>There aren't</i>
<i>any Duran Duran fans.</i>

555
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,027
They don't make them anymore.

556
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:17,929
<i>If there's< no infection,</i>

557
00:22:17,997 --> 00:22:19,931
it's because there aren't
any fans, no white cells.

558
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:22,600
You think his spleen?

559
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:26,338
Why do I bother
with these great metaphors

560
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:28,239
<i>if i still have</i>
<i>to spell it out?</i>

561
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:29,941
Yes, I think it's his spleen.
Go get a biopsy.

562
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:31,543
I'll try to get
<i>New Moon on Monday</i>

563
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,977
out of my head.

564
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:37,382
Why are you talking this time?

565
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:43,888
If I quit,
will you rehire Foreman?

566
00:22:43,956 --> 00:22:45,290
Why?

567
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:46,291
He can't find another job.

568
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,659
I can.

569
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:50,195
And you're willing to make
that sacrifice for him?

570
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:51,996
Yes.

571
00:22:52,064 --> 00:22:54,833
Does Foreman know about this plan?

572
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,768
Yes.

573
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:04,376
Well, if he's okay with it,
who am I to say no?

574
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:10,348
(Kutner)
Hold still.

575
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,450
Mm.

576
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:16,454
You think it's my spleen?

577
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,590
That's what they're testing.

578
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:22,560
So if I happen to cure you,

579
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:24,629
what happens then?

580
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:27,632
You start thinking that God
was working through me?

581
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,834
This is some sort of miracle?

582
00:23:29,902 --> 00:23:30,969
Do you think I'm an idiot?

583
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,437
That's what <i>I'm</i> testing.

584
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:36,174
Losing my faith
wasn't a choice I made.

585
00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:37,175
It happened.

586
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:38,977
<i>It's gone for good.</i>

587
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,178
<i>(House) But if it can</i>
<i>magically disappear,</i>

588
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:42,113
it can magically reappear,

589
00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:43,381
And that's what you're hoping.

590
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,284
Your job...
- Sucks.

591
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:48,386
That's my point.

592
00:23:48,454 --> 00:23:50,889
You can make more money
frapping decafs,

593
00:23:50,956 --> 00:23:53,558
and yet you're still ministering
to the meek.

594
00:23:53,626 --> 00:23:56,594
Why do the Lord's work if
the Lord has left the building?

595
00:23:56,662 --> 00:23:58,296
I've been with the church
my entire adult life.

596
00:23:58,364 --> 00:23:59,964
It's my only marketable skill.

597
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:03,101
I detect the stink
of leftover faith.

598
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:06,204
You want to talk hypocrisy,
what about you?

599
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:08,306
You act like you don't care
about anyone,

600
00:24:08,374 --> 00:24:10,175
<i>but here you are</i>

601
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:11,709
Saving lives.

602
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:14,045
Solving puzzles.

603
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:16,147
Saving lives
is just collateral damage.

604
00:24:16,215 --> 00:24:17,382
Yeah, nice try.

605
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,616
I don't think you're looking

606
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:20,051
for somebody
to prove you right.

607
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:22,020
I think you're looking
for somebody to prove you wrong,

608
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:25,123
to give you hope.

609
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:27,659
You want to believe,
don't you?

610
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:32,664
Yeah, I want to walk out

611
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:35,133
and find myself
in a forest of whore trees,

612
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:36,935
but I don't think
it's a good idea

613
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:38,937
to tell people
to go fornicate with fruit.

614
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:48,580
Hey, I was just talking
about you...

615
00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:52,083
not you specifically--
whores and hypocrisy.

616
00:24:52,151 --> 00:24:54,118
[sighs]
You were right.

617
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:56,187
I don't want you there.

618
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:59,190
It's a special occasion
filled with love and acceptance,

619
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:01,459
and the last thing I need

620
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:03,127
is someone there who's filled
with loathing and contempt.

621
00:25:05,731 --> 00:25:06,998
Okay.

622
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:10,068
That's it?

623
00:25:11,737 --> 00:25:13,671
You're really not coming?

624
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:16,307
I'm really not coming.

625
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,710
Thank you.

626
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:21,446
You're welcome.

627
00:25:21,514 --> 00:25:22,914
Gosh, I feel so grown up.

628
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:28,820
He's obviously
just jerking you around,

629
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:29,988
<i>wants to see</i>
<i>if you're serious.</i>

630
00:25:30,055 --> 00:25:31,089
<i>If you just</i>
<i>stick it out,</i>

631
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,190
I think he'll bring
Foreman back.

632
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:33,691
I don't,
and even if I'm wrong,

633
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,426
I think you
should still split up.

634
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,529
<i>It's just a matter of time</i>
<i>before one of you</i>

635
00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:39,764
finds the other in bed
with another woman.

636
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:41,799
This coming
from the relationship expert.

637
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:43,201
12 years and counting.

638
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:45,537
Hey, if you can make it
that long, then anyone can.

639
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:47,205
Funny how the two people
in the room

640
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:50,074
Who think relationships are easy
are both single.

641
00:25:50,142 --> 00:25:51,609
I don't think they're easy.

642
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:53,778
That's why I think if you find
something that could be good,

643
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,446
you should hang on to it.

644
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,481
<i>Everything could be good.</i>

645
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:57,515
Very little ever is.

646
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:58,616
His spleen is fine,

647
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,318
just some
insignificant traces

648
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:01,586
<i>of minor bugs.</i>

649
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:02,620
<i>Nothing</i>
<i>that'd make him sick.</i>

650
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:05,490
Which minor bugs?

651
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:09,827
Why do people suddenly find
religion when they have kids?

652
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:12,163
Fear of the unknown.

653
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,999
Cornerstone of faith.

654
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:16,501
I think it makes perfect sense.

655
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:20,004
So it makes sense
because it doesn't make sense.

656
00:26:20,072 --> 00:26:21,339
The fact that you're railing
about it

657
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:24,909
doesn't make a lot of sense.

658
00:26:24,977 --> 00:26:26,644
You really got a thing
for your boss, huh?

659
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:29,414
I've got a thing
for my boss's thing.

660
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:31,416
<i>She doesn't have</i>
<i>a thing...</i>

661
00:26:31,483 --> 00:26:32,784
per se.

662
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:35,687
I'm big on metaphors.

663
00:26:35,754 --> 00:26:37,288
What about you?

664
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:39,324
29 years of celibacy.

665
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,825
What's holding
you back now?

666
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:42,894
Who wants a relationship
with a priest?

667
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:45,063
Who wants a relationship?

668
00:26:47,266 --> 00:26:49,601
House?

669
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:55,440
It's the holy water.

670
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:57,075
<i>We assumed</i>
<i>if it was an infection,</i>

671
00:26:57,142 --> 00:26:58,710
it had to be
something big and nasty.

672
00:26:58,777 --> 00:27:00,778
But he has pneumocystis,

673
00:27:00,846 --> 00:27:03,781
a harmless bug that's everywhere
and never makes anyone sick,

674
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:05,717
unless they have
a compromised immune system.

675
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,496
So father Nietzsche
has AIDS.

676
00:27:22,052 --> 00:27:23,152
Impossible.

677
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,587
I've never had
a blood transfusion.

678
00:27:24,655 --> 00:27:26,789
I've never done I.V. drugs.
I've never had sex.

679
00:27:26,857 --> 00:27:28,257
So prove it.
Have an AIDS test.

680
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:29,725
No.

681
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:31,260
I know I don't have AIDS.

682
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:33,162
We can't treat you
until we know what it is.

683
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,897
A negative result proves nothing.

684
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:36,899
On the off chance
it's a false positive,

685
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,468
I permanently lose
any credibility

686
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:40,536
I have left.
- I'd say you just lost that.

687
00:27:40,604 --> 00:27:42,338
I'd say I lost that
with you a long time ago.

688
00:27:45,843 --> 00:27:47,877
(Taub)
We should start

689
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:49,011
Treatment for AIDS.
<i>(Kutner) We need to be sure.</i>

690
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,213
<i>The antiretrovirals</i>

691
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,814
could fry his heart,
his liver, his kidneys.

692
00:27:51,882 --> 00:27:53,883
I'm willing to take that chance.
- Big of you.

693
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:56,018
I'm more worried
about the kid he molested.

694
00:27:56,086 --> 00:27:57,954
We should be finding him
and getting him tested.

695
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:00,089
You don't think he already got tested?
- Maybe he did, maybe he didn't,

696
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:01,824
but that's a chance
I'm not willing to take.

697
00:28:01,892 --> 00:28:03,226
<i>Legally, we can't inform</i>

698
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:04,961
sexual partners about STDs.

699
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:06,529
<i>This isn't some middle-aged</i>
<i>barfly who likes it bareback.</i>

700
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:08,431
This is an innocent kid
who was molested.

701
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:10,399
You just want to rub
the priest's face in it,

702
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:11,767
get him transferred again.

703
00:28:11,835 --> 00:28:14,937
Yeah, heaven forbid
a diddler has job issues.

704
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:16,973
And you get brought up
on charges.

<i>this week.</i>

706
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:20,610
Treat him for AIDS.

707
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,415
I found a job.

708
00:28:26,483 --> 00:28:28,384
I didn't know you were looking.

709
00:28:28,452 --> 00:28:30,286
Eggers at Mercy
says I can start Monday.

710
00:28:30,354 --> 00:28:32,154
Why would you--

711
00:28:32,222 --> 00:28:34,056
House says if I go,
you can come back.

712
00:28:34,124 --> 00:28:35,691
[scoffs]
It's been less than two days.

713
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,927
Give up on me that fast?
You get a job behind my back?

714
00:28:37,995 --> 00:28:40,062
You're acting
like I'm cheating on you.

715
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,264
I said I would handle this.

716
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,800
House knew you'd be like this.

717
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:49,372
[chuckles]
Wow.

718
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:52,208
I guess House knows me
better than you do.

719
00:28:52,276 --> 00:28:53,709
Too bad I don't go both ways.

720
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:55,144
[silverware clanking]

721
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:56,245
Good night.

722
00:29:00,017 --> 00:29:02,385
Don't you hate when they

723
00:29:02,452 --> 00:29:04,487
Put the mushrooms
underneath the cheese?

724
00:29:04,555 --> 00:29:08,057
Your attendance
is validating her hypocrisy.

725
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,959
If she invited you

726
00:29:10,027 --> 00:29:11,961
to a ceremonial lynching,
would you go?

727
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:14,063
It would depend
on what she was serving.

728
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:15,998
Everyone's a hypocrite.

729
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:19,869
Why are you suddenly so obsessed
with Cuddy's particular brand?

730
00:29:19,937 --> 00:29:21,270
Just making conversation.

731
00:29:21,338 --> 00:29:22,705
Would you rather

732
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:24,674
we go back to talking
about mushrooms and cheese?

733
00:29:24,741 --> 00:29:26,642
You're the hypocrite!

734
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,578
You want to go!

735
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:30,813
You don't resent this baby.
You want to be a part of it.

736
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:33,516
Yes, but not
until her 16th birthday...

737
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:34,084
in some states.

738
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:35,718
This is ridiculous.
You two deserve each other.

739
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:37,219
If you want to go,

740
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:39,689
Just go and act
like a human being.

741
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:41,757
Wow, solid advice,

742
00:29:41,825 --> 00:29:42,992
except for two things.

743
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,393
I'm acting
like I don't want to go

744
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:46,662
because I don't want
to go, and...

745
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,333
I am incapable

746
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,201
of acting like a human being.

747
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:05,948
Ryan?

748
00:30:07,784 --> 00:30:08,751
Yeah.

749
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:11,654
I'm Dr. Chris Taub.
Can we talk?

750
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:14,090
Yeah.
What's wrong?

751
00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:16,392
Uh, in private?

752
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,028
Nobody's listening to us here.

753
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:22,865
Um, I work at
Princeton Plainsboro Hospital.

754
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:24,967
I have some news
about Father Daniel Bresson.

755
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:30,539
What about him?

756
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:32,642
Uh, we believe he has AIDS.

757
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:36,646
Okay, so?

758
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:37,880
Well...

759
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:40,716
Uh, given the incident
four years ago,

760
00:30:40,784 --> 00:30:42,551
I think you should be tested,

761
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:45,921
Unless you've already done so.

762
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:50,326
How sick is he?

763
00:30:50,394 --> 00:30:51,560
Very.

764
00:30:53,363 --> 00:30:55,131
Okay.
Well, um, thanks.

765
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:58,167
Have you been tested?

766
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:00,202
Uh, yeah.

767
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,571
And?

768
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:06,175
And it really isn't any
of your business.

769
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:20,589
I want my job back.

770
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,026
Love,

771
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:25,828
sacrifice, deception,

772
00:31:25,896 --> 00:31:28,264
and now betrayal.

773
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:30,032
This is better
than a <i>telenovela.</i>

774
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,000
What's going on?

775
00:31:31,068 --> 00:31:32,535
Well...

776
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:34,403
Either Foreman is here,
as the two of you discussed,

777
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:36,238
to beg for his job back

778
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:37,506
in exchange for me dumping you,

779
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:38,974
or...

780
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:40,009
nothing.

781
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:43,813
You're trying to get me fired?

782
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,514
<i>I'm suggesting you quit</i>

783
00:31:45,582 --> 00:31:48,417
and I stay, which is exactly
what you suggested last night.

784
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:49,952
I told Eggers I didn't want the job.

785
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,287
Find another one.

786
00:31:51,354 --> 00:31:53,322
Only took you eight hours
to find that one.

787
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,690
The point is,

788
00:31:54,758 --> 00:31:56,459
why didn't you tell me
you were doing this?

789
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:57,526
Why are you here without me?

790
00:31:57,594 --> 00:31:59,528
You're overreacting.

791
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:00,496
We'll talk about this later.
- Oh, that's what this is about.

792
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:01,964
It's about you taking control.

793
00:32:02,032 --> 00:32:04,700
It's about you not being able
to handle me saving your ass.

794
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:06,268
And you're not
being controlling right now?

795
00:32:06,336 --> 00:32:07,737
<i>(House)</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>

796
00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:09,205
Who's the controlling bitch now?

797
00:32:09,272 --> 00:32:10,272
House, shut up.

798
00:32:11,775 --> 00:32:13,943
You never wanted to take
that other job.

799
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,978
You never wanted to save me.

800
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:18,581
You wanted to offer to save me
so you wouldn't feel guilty.

801
00:32:18,648 --> 00:32:20,349
<i>You knew I'd say no.</i>

802
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,585
That's why you're so mad
right now.

803
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:27,089
You're an idiot.

804
00:32:33,797 --> 00:32:37,333
Well, either you can go after
her and try and patch things up,

805
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,703
or you blow her off
and take your old job back.

806
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,408

807
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,683
Welcome back.

00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:02,458
AIDS meds aren't gonna work.

809
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:04,794
If you'd let us do a test,
we could stop treating you,

810
00:33:04,861 --> 00:33:06,195
or you could stop lying.

811

[breathes deeply]

812
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:10,699
I know the feeling.

813
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:13,035
[monitor beeping] BP's climbing.
You feeling okay?

00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:14,970
<i>No, I feel flushed.</i>

00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:17,173
<i>Ah, I'm burning</i>
<i>all over.</i>

816
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,541
Ah, my chest.

817
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:19,575
Ah.

818
00:33:24,494 --> 00:33:25,794
<i>(Taub)</i>
<i>It's not a new symptom.</i>

819
00:33:25,862 --> 00:33:27,296
<i>It's just a reaction</i>
<i>to the AIDS meds.</i>

820
00:33:27,363 --> 00:33:29,631
He reacted by getting worse.
Means it's not AIDS.

821
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:31,533
So went Satan forth
from the presence of the Lord

822
00:33:31,601 --> 00:33:34,503
and smote Job sore with boils.

823
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,438
You think it's hyper-IGE syndrome?

824
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:39,174
I prefer the colloquial term
"Job syndrome."

825
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:41,576
Explains the symptom and my quote.

826
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,111
That's the first thing I checked.

827
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:44,346
VELs are normal.

828
00:33:44,414 --> 00:33:45,681
Could be some other genetic disorder.

829
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:47,149
Cerebral microtumors
could explain the blindness

830
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:48,383
<i>and the hallucinations.</i>

831
00:33:48,451 --> 00:33:49,751
We didn't find any tumors.

832
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:50,986
<i>That's why</i>
<i>I didn't say "tumors."</i>

833
00:33:51,054 --> 00:33:53,255
I said "microtumors."

834
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,723
<i>So your explanation</i>
<i>doesn't depend</i>

835
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:56,024
on us being major morons,
just morons?

836
00:33:57,593 --> 00:33:59,161
We should start genetic testing.

837
00:33:59,228 --> 00:34:00,195
It takes too long.

838
00:34:00,263 --> 00:34:01,229
So we start treatment.

839
00:34:01,297 --> 00:34:02,531
Treatment is surgery.

840
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:04,433
<i>We can't open him up</i>
<i>without confirmation.</i>

841
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,867
So your position is we can't
test and we can't treat?

842
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:07,502
My position is you're wrong.

843
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,304
This isn't gonna work.

844
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:13,208
Are you kidding?
I've never felt more alive.

845
00:34:13,276 --> 00:34:15,477
Conflict breeds creativity.
Go run the genetic tests.

846
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:17,679
On it.

847
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:26,254
So now you don't think
I have AIDS?

848
00:34:26,322 --> 00:34:27,789
I still think it's AIDS.

849
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,892
On the off chance it isn't,
we're pursuing other avenues.

Uh, we don't know
what's wrong with him.

Nope.

But please, feel free
to blather on.

869
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:14,062
Raising a child

<i>and you can't condemn her</i>

884
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:44,092
<i>for recognizing that.</i>

885
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,080
Are you eliminating symptoms?

886
00:37:05,148 --> 00:37:07,649
We can know everything.

887
00:37:07,717 --> 00:37:09,885
This is medicine,
not metaphysics.

888
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:11,586
Truth is truth.

889
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,260
It fits.

890
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:19,761
It doesn't fit.

891
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:21,663
You can't eliminate a symptom.

892
00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:23,732
I can if it's not a symptom.

893
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:24,933
Well, what is it?

894
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:26,902
Not a symptom.

895
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:37,779
You're not gonna die.

896
00:37:40,783 --> 00:37:42,951
You have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

897
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:45,420
It impairs your immune system,

898
00:37:45,488 --> 00:37:47,088
Makes you susceptible
to all the AIDS stuff

899
00:37:47,156 --> 00:37:48,590
Without actually having AIDS.

900
00:37:48,658 --> 00:37:51,860
And you didn't catch it.
You were born with it.

901
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:54,262
Another gift from God.

902
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,665
You sure?

903
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,166
Genetic test

904
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,069
should confirm it, but it
explains all your symptoms--

905
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:03,138
toe, chest, eyes, skin.

906
00:38:03,206 --> 00:38:05,874
What about my hallucination?

907
00:38:05,942 --> 00:38:08,543
Scotch explains that.

908
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,081
But that was just a coincidence.

909
00:38:15,484 --> 00:38:19,087
Coincidences do happen.

910
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,859
That coincidence is what brought
me to you in the first place.

911
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,832
You promised
you wouldn't go there.

912
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,768
Einstein said,

913
00:38:33,836 --> 00:38:37,339
"coincidence is God's way
of remaining anonymous."

914
00:38:37,406 --> 00:38:39,441
A woman in Florida said,

915
00:38:39,508 --> 00:38:41,943
"Look, Jesus
is on my cheese sandwich."

916
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:44,279
You didn't even want
to take my case.

917
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:46,815
You didn't even think
I was sick.

918
00:38:46,882 --> 00:38:48,817
The fact that I was wrong

919
00:38:48,884 --> 00:38:51,720
is not a proof of God.

920
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,259
I'm just trying to understand

921
00:38:57,326 --> 00:39:00,228
how my life could completely
turn around in a single day.

922
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:04,866
Don't worry.

923
00:39:04,934 --> 00:39:07,402
Your life will go
back to sucking soon enough.

924
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,707
Everything that happened to you
can be rationally explained.

925
00:39:12,775 --> 00:39:15,810
I know.

926
00:39:15,878 --> 00:39:17,746
It's just...

927
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,552
That's a lot of coincidences.

928
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,566
[sighs]

929
00:39:40,403 --> 00:39:44,673
House was right about the priest.

930
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,508
Genetic test confirmed
it was Wiskott-Aldrich.

931
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:48,243
And I would've discharged him.

932
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:50,679
Everybody would've
discharged him, House included.

933
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:53,815
He only took that case
as a stall.

934
00:39:53,883 --> 00:39:56,751
And yet it was a real case,
and he solved it.

935
00:39:56,819 --> 00:40:00,221
But by violating
his own principles

936
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:02,691
and ignoring the admitting symptoms.

937
00:40:02,758 --> 00:40:04,559
Still he somehow got away with it.

938
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:09,197
Saved another life.

939
00:40:09,265 --> 00:40:11,766
You want him there tonight.

940
00:40:17,506 --> 00:40:19,074
You should tell him.

941
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,752
[clears throat]

942
00:40:37,193 --> 00:40:39,694
It's--it's cold out there.

943
00:40:39,762 --> 00:40:41,796
At least you have shoes
that cover your toes.

944
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,701
So it's tonight?

945
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:48,703
Yep.

946
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:50,772
Bad weather for it, huh?

947
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,240
Maybe you'll get lucky.

948
00:40:52,308 --> 00:40:53,742
Maybe your sister will decide

949
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:55,710
The roads are too dangerous
to drive on.

950
00:40:57,012 --> 00:40:58,613
Fingers crossed.

951
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,287
Have fun.

952
00:41:06,355 --> 00:41:09,357
