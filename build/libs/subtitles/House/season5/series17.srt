1
00:00:11,696 --> 00:00:13,793
Am I gonna have
to give a speech?

2
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:14,962
You're the publisher.

3
00:00:15,043 --> 00:00:16,805
Can't you do it?
- I can warm them up.

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,007
But you are
gonna have

5
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:19,449
to get over this fear
of public speaking

6
00:00:19,513 --> 00:00:20,921
before the book tour.

7
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:23,613
Everybody.

8
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:26,063
Can I have your attention?
Thank you.

9
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:28,768
Tim has a few words
to say.

10
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,131
There you go, Tim.
They're warmed up.

11
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,644
Well, what do you say
at a time like this?

12
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:40,126
Seriously,
what do you say?

13
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:42,930
You could thank people
for coming.

14
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:44,772
Thank you, Nick.

15
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:47,206
Actually,
I'm always thanking Nick,

16
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:50,344
A man not only famous
for his ruthless editor's pen,

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,582
but his patient hand-holding
of crazy authors.

18
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:55,551
You'd think that
after three novels,

19
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:58,323
I'd start to develop
a little confidence, but...

20
00:00:58,387 --> 00:01:00,997
for a book like this, we are
happy to supply the confidence.

21
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:01,895
Best-seller.

22
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,466
Well,
that's not gonna happen.

23
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,516
What?

24
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:09,087
Come on.
Short stories don't make money.

25
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:11,393
Short stories weren't making
money back in 1908.

26
00:01:11,457 --> 00:01:12,818
You'd have
to be mathematically illiterate

27
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:14,165
to think they'd do as well
as a novel.

28
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:16,760
Okay, Nick, let's step away
from the champagne

29
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:19,130
before somebody gets hurt.

30
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,901
You slaved over this book
right next to me.

31
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:24,512
Why would Northrop even publish?

32
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:28,693
Have you failed to notice
you're our star author?

33
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:29,829
Obviously, Elaine wouldn't want
to offend you.

34
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:31,432
Uh, Honey.

35
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:37,437
I-I'm sorry.

36
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:39,873
I don't--I don't know
why I said that.

37
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:41,282
He's joking.

38
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:42,323
Nick knows as well
as anyone

39
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:43,782
what you have done
is art.

40
00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:45,686
So is folding paper
into animal shapes,

41
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,464
but you don't expect
to make a living off it.

42
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:48,667
What the hell is wrong
with you?

43
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,077
You really think someone
who goes

44
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:51,310
through ten assistants a year
and doesn't return

45
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,574
her own children's phone calls

46
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:54,049
would give a damn
about the state

47
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,554
of the American short story?

48
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,852
Please, be quiet.

49
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,604
I think
something's wrong.

50
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:07,406
That title was a mistake too.

51
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:08,976
People are gonna compare you
to Salinger,

52
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:12,950
and, boy, are you gonna come up
short on that one.

53
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:19,725
Honey!

54
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,672
Call 911.
Help! We need help!

55
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:59,548
Cameron brought this up
from the E.R.

56
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,294
Doesn't look
like a friendship bracelet.

57
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:05,172
The most famous case study
in medical history.

58
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:06,597
You're telling me
this patient got

59
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:08,905
a railroad spike drilled
through his frontal lobe?

60
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:11,211
No. No trauma, but he does
have frontal lobe disinhibition.

61
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:13,311
Just like Gage.

62
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,926
Gage was a different person
after the spike.

63
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:16,255
Argumentative.
Impulsive.

64
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,157
Whereas our guy became
a different person

65
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:19,390
after chardonnay.

66
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:21,692
He was sober
when they brought him in.

67
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,421
There's also the nosebleed,
the collapse.

68
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:24,526
MRI show anything?

69
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,661
Nothing.
- Good.

70
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:27,533
What fun would that be?

71
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,437
So the tumor's not
in the cool neighborhood.

72
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:30,861
It's cool neighborhood
adjacent.

73
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:32,140
A well-placed tumor

74
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:33,532
in the nasal cavity
eroding into the brain

75
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:34,907
could do the damage.

76
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,235
Go stick a scope
up Phineas's nose.

77
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,131
See what you find.

78
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:46,042
Daddy, I'm always gonna win

79
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:47,880
if you keep telling me
what your cards are.

80
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:49,720
Well, then suppose
I tell you...

81
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:50,648
while I tickle you.

82
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,016
Mr. Greenwald, I'm Dr. Taub.

83
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:54,455
Is is Dr. Kutner.

84
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,958
We're here for another test.
Sorry about that.

85
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:57,717
You don't look sorry.

86
00:03:57,783 --> 00:04:00,883
Um, no offense.

87
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,324
Although you do look
kind of cheerful.

88
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,923
It's a little creepy.

89
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,132
Should I want a doctor who's
excited about how sick I am?

90
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:07,428
I'm not--

91
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:08,498
We're going to put this
up your nose,

92
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:10,130
scan for any problems.

93
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:13,168
I can assure you that we are
completely unexcited about that.

94
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:16,703
Excuse me, sweetie.

95
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,734
She has an auditory
processing disability.

96
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,901
Marika-beleeka, you have
to get off the bed.

97
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:24,572
This might be
slightly uncomfortable.

98
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:27,179
Honey, do you mind
if I step out?

99
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:28,667
I have to make sure
the final arrangements

100
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,979
are in place
for the breast cancer walk.

101
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:31,483
Yeah, you do that.

102
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:33,176
I'll pretend to be macho
while a guy stuffs

103
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:35,114
three feet of plastic
up my nose.

104
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:38,249
It's too bad
it's not your nose.

105
00:04:38,313 --> 00:04:40,120
Lots more room to maneuver.

106
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:43,255
I guess the walk
can wait ten minutes.

107
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,414
Or in a sensible world,
even longer.

108
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:47,380
Just how does tying up traffic
for six hours

109
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:48,613
stop breast cancer?

110
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:49,891
You know how it works.
People donate--

111
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,260
Why not spend six hours
building houses

112
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,653
for Habitat for Humanity?

113
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:56,259
Or is it wrong to help
two groups of people at once?

114
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:59,026
I bet there are those who have
breast cancer and no home.

115
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:01,059
It's my job, Nick.

116
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:03,426
You walked yourself last year.
- To be supportive.

117
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:05,539
And because I knew you wouldn't
have sex with me if I didn't.

118
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:09,410
I'm gonna make my call.

119
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,737
Make this go away.

120
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:18,111
God, that honker really is huge,
isn't it?

121
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:23,391
Wednesday night.

122
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,015
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie
versus the Incinerator.

123
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:28,128
I can't.

124
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:30,320
Let me rephrase.
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie--

125
00:05:30,384 --> 00:05:32,432
I understand
monster truck code.

126
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:33,855
Do you understand "can't"?

127
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,567
not when it follows
"Low-Down-Blue-Meanie."

128
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,104
Is the world coming to an end
Tuesday night?

129
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:40,465
Otherwise, Wednesday--

130
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,862
All right,
it's not "can't."

131
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,342
It's "don't want to."

132
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:48,606
The fact is I just don like
monster trucks.

133
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,478
Yes, you do.

134
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:52,237
No, I don't.

135
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,174
You've always liked
monster trucks.

136
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:55,117
No, you've always
liked them.

137
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:57,581
I've tolerated them.

138
00:05:57,646 --> 00:06:00,284
Seriously, I can only watch

139
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,620
so many hyped-up dune buggies
crush so many motor homes

140
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:04,831
without feeling the urge
<i>to go see La Boheme.</i>

141
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:05,883
And I hate opera too.

142
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,428
What are you hiding?

143
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,828
I'm not hiding it.

144
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:13,963
I'm saying it loud and proud.
Death to monster trucks.

145
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:15,404
No nasal cancer.

146
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:18,938
And no marriage either
if our patient keeps saying

147
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:19,834
everything that comes
into his head without regard

148
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:21,563
for the consequences.

149
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:23,544
You always led me to believe
you were one of a kind.

150
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:24,841
Luckily, jerkiness is

151
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,040
a temporary condition
for this guy.

152
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:27,800
No, it's not.

153
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:29,478
We may be able to fix
his impulse to say

154
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:31,270
his thoughts out loud,
but he always gonna be

155
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:32,919
the guy who thinks them.

156
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,741
But he's also gonna be
the guy who doesn't say them.

157
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:36,421
If he spent his whole life

158
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:37,910
constructing
this nice guy persona,

159
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:41,014
isn't that as much who
he really is as anything else?

160
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,349
You would argue that.
You're all persona.

161
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,748
I agree with Wilson.
This guy's a Harry Potter.

162
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:49,525
The sorting hat was going
to put Harry in Slytherin

163
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,124
based on his nature.

164
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:52,260
He refused,
so he ended up in Gryffindor.

165
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:53,636
Through choice.

166
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:55,235
There's damage
somewhere in his brain.

167
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:56,196
Find it.

168
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:00,771
Are you sure
you understand?

169
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:04,804
No, I'm lying.
Except I can't.

170
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:06,149
You ask me questions.

171
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:08,211
While I talk,
you look

172
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:09,940
at my brain activity to see
where it's screwed up.

173
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:12,146
Then you're gonna cut the
screwed up part out to test it.

174
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:14,418
It's depressing,
but it's not rocket science.

175
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:15,441
I think he understands.

176
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,776
I don't mean
to be abrasive.

177
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:20,145
Especially since you're such
a pleasure to image naked.

178
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:23,182
I'm, sorry.
- It's okay.

179
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:24,687
Thank you
for understanding.

180
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:26,831
I'd do you, though.

181
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:28,157
Really, my apologies.

182
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:29,518
This stuff just comes out.

183
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:30,685
It's okay.
- House paged.

184
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:32,925
Whoa, I would do her
in a minute

185
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,725
with fudge
and a cherry on top.

186
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:38,300
Would someone please explain
to this woman?

187
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,405
There's only so many apologies--

188
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,868
He has frontal lobe
disinhibition.

189
00:07:41,932 --> 00:07:43,931
I've already embarrassed
myself with one doctor,

190
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:46,172
whom I am at this moment
imagining with you

191
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:49,340
in a king-sized bed
with a mirror on the ceiling.

192
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:53,979
But if I couldn't have
both of you together,

193
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,675
you definitely would be
my first choice.

194
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:57,884
Where's House?

195
00:07:57,948 --> 00:07:59,146
It's like trying not
to think of an elephant.

196
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:00,426
Not that you're an elephant.

197
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:02,586
Your breasts, in fact,
are all Homo Sapiens--

198
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:03,994
House isn't here.

199
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:06,858
Oh, he wouldn't have paged me
if he couldn't

200
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:09,690
watch and enjoy the--

201
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:17,577
Your tush is like the pistons
in a Ferrari.

202
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,014
You're welcome.

203
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,047
That was for my benefit

204
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,951
You're 40 years old...
- 38.

205
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:34,151
The administrator
of a hospital...

206
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,512
Dean of Medicine.

207
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,383
People don't get personal
with you.

208
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:38,919
Except for me,
and you dismiss me as a jerk

209
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:40,150
who's jerking you around.

210
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:42,199
But that guy can only tell
the truth.

211
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:44,567
And he prefers your body to that
of a smokin' young hottie.

212
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:48,438
So that was your way
of saying I look good today.

213
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:51,061
You didn't get
the slightest kick out of that?

214
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:54,533
Don't be ridiculous,
House.

215
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:02,004
I hope you know
your pistons are second to none.

216
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,973
I'm okay.

217
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:06,339
I'm not jealous
of Cuddy's pistons.

218
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,114
Starting baseline activation.

219
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,113
You sure?
You looked upset.

220
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:12,609
What he was saying
was obnoxious.

221
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,825
You've never been called
attractive?

222
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,648
He didn't call me attractive.

223
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:17,216
He cast me
in his mental porno.

224
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,055
That's what attractive means.

225
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,590
It means "I'm attracted
to you, sexually."

226
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:22,591
Attracted can also mean "I'm
attracted to the whole package.

227
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:25,085
To who you are."

228
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,820
Slight elevation
at transaxial 60.

229
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,466
It could.
It never does.

230
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:30,859
It's what women choose to hear,
not what men say.

231
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:32,234
Actually,
it's exactly what men say

232
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,465
IF they have any brains.

233
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:34,823
All right, we have enough
for a baseline.

234
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:36,905
What can we ask him
that's indiscreet,

235
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,895
but that he won't hate us
for knowing?

236
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:41,831
Nick, do you vote
the same way as your wife?

237
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,110
God, no.

238
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:45,877
Good. He's spiking at 30.

239
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:47,045
She believes I voted
for Hillary Clinton

240
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,172
in the primary and Obama
in the general.

241
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:51,141
You're thinking I'm secretly
a Republican, right?

242
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:52,484
Wrong.

243
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,171
I secretly don't vote.
Ever.

244
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:59,217
Wait, you're 46,
and you've never voted?

245
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:01,376
Your voice is
no longer attractive to me

246
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,689
with that note
of disapproval.

247
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:04,623
Although I'm sure
that will pass.

248
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,255
Look at that.

249
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,791
There's a spot in the Cingulate
Gyrus that's not lighting up.

250
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:10,782
One vote makes a difference?
Not mathematically true.

251
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:12,429
Okay, Nick.
We've got what we need.

252
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,797
We can't biopsy that.
It's too close to the brainstem.

253
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:17,324
Could be neurosarcoidosis.
At least it's treatable.

254
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:19,164
So we give him steroids,
and if we're right,

255
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,124
we should start seeing
his symptoms improve

256
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:21,261
within half a day.

257
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:26,764
What are you looking at?

258
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:29,534
I find your strong attachment

259
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,646
to a working democracy
to be extremely sexy.

260
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,715
Ooh, you smooth talker.

261
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:38,619
Do you think
my nose is too big?

262
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:41,749
Relax, he also implied my
bedside manner was a little off.

263
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,786
You don't agree with that,
right?

264
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,753
No.

265
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:48,793
No one's ever mentioned
your nose before?

266
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,120
You're a plastic surgeon.

267
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,559
They tell me
it suits my face.

268
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,855
It does.
- Maybe.

269
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,567
Maybe that's just
the social contract.

270
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:57,767
I tell you
you're a people person.

271
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,126
How can you know the truth?

272
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,532
You could ask
for the truth.

273
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:03,060
What do you think
of my nose?

274
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:05,298
Please tell me the truth.
- It's fine. It's a nose.

275
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,243
Just proving a point.

276
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:17,474
Anyone sitting here?

277
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:18,913
Just my persona.

278
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:25,089
You know, it's amazing the
way people cling onto insults.

279
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:27,311
Or what they think
are insults.

280
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,648
So that wasn't an insult?

281
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:32,495
I'm not suggesting
that, like our patient,

282
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,133
beneath a candy shell
of compulsive nicene.

283
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,557
I'm not always nice.

284
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:39,996
I'm not nice to you.

285
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:41,867
Because you know
nice bores me.

286
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,268
Hence, still nice.

287
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:46,139
No, I'm suggesting
that you have no core.

288
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,401
You're what whoever you're with
needs you to be.

289
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:52,698
Okay, I guess
that could be insulting.

290
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,442
The interesting question
is why.

291
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,049
Why do you think
the world will end

292
00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:59,209
in chaos and destruction
if you're not there to save it?

293
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:01,754
Because when my parents
put me in the rocket

294
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,185
and sent me here, they said,
"James, you will grow

295
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,656
to manhood
under yellow sun--"

296
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:07,512
And why'd you lie
about monster trucks?

297
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:08,984
I didn't.

298
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:11,318
I checked
your appointment book.

299
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:12,919
You got tomorrow night
marked off,

300
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:14,326
but you didn't put down
what you were doing.

301
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,053
So you thought
someone might look at the book--

302
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:19,526
I'm playing racquetball
tomorrow night with Taub.

303
00:12:19,591 --> 00:12:21,558
Why would you hide that?

304
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,797
Because the world revolves
around you.

305
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:25,332
I devote time
to anyone else,

306
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:27,701
you'd end up stalking me
and harassing them.

307
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:29,795
You say that
as though it wouldn't be fun.

308
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:31,762
And maybe I didn't want
to rub your nose

309
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:34,148
in the fact that we'd be doing
something you can no longer do.

310
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,042
Because I'm nice.

311
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:44,546
I thought you said the
steroids were gonna help him.

312
00:12:46,114 --> 00:12:47,313
What--is it his heart?

313
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:50,960
EKG says heart's fine.

314
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:52,958
It's gotta be the kidneys.

315
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:53,822
I need to get him
on dialysis.

316
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:57,150
Oh.

317
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:01,349
He's on dialysis,
and he's stable.

318
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:03,253
We know
it's not systemic sclerosis.

319
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:07,956
Hey, Cyrano de Berkowitz.

320
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:09,669
Let it go.

321
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:12,357
Chronic lymphocytic
leukemia could explain

322
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:13,701
brain and kidney problems.

323
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:15,764
The CBC showed
normal white blood cells.

324
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:19,907
So how long have you been
playing racquetball with Wilson?

325
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:22,243
Four, five times.

326
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:23,474
Could be diabetes.

327
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:25,138
Or a congenital
metabolic disorder.

328
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:27,474
Congenital disorders
generally don't wait

329
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,074
till you're 46 to manifest.

330
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,040
So he's a late bloomer.

331
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:32,512
His daughter has
a neurological condition.

332
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:34,320
First of all,

333
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:36,113
Wilson played tennis
on his college team,

334
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:38,816
and you are a Jew.

335
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,718
You're not athletic.

336
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:42,926
Run to the end of the hall
and back. I'll time you.

337
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:44,349
Sandy Koufax is Jewish.

338
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,125
Greatest left-handed pitcher
of all time.

339
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:48,892
Sandy Koufax is all you Jews
go on about.

340
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:53,258
Sandy Koufax and the holocaust.
Gets old.

341
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:55,288
There are dozens
of congenital conditions

342
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,600
that fit our parameters.

343
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:58,198
We can't spend time
gene testing

344
00:13:58,265 --> 00:13:59,703
for all of 'em, especially
when we're only guessing

345
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:00,934
it's congenital.

346
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,174
Is a z-shot
offensive or defensive?

347
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,933
It's both.

348
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:06,771
You suspected
that was a trick question.

349
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:08,932
But I could have said
neither.

350
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:10,371
Diabetes makes more sense.

351
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:12,608
We can narrow
the testing down

352
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:14,113
to 40 likely candidates.

353
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:15,536
Test for peripheral
nerve damage.

354
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:16,880
He's got brain damage.

355
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:18,510
He's likely to have
peripheral nerve damage

356
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:19,838
no matter what the cause.

357
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:21,343
Yes, that's why we should not
test him for it.

358
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:23,614
Test the daughter.

359
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,942
Kutner runs the nerve test.

360
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:27,149
Taub, you might be right
about the diabetes.

361
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:28,414
Take supper away
from our patient

362
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:30,813
and run
a glucose tolerance test.

363
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:33,548
Oh, and the nurses have been
working so hard.

364
00:14:33,628 --> 00:14:35,083
You can do the blood draws
yourself.

365
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:37,483
They have to be done
every couple hours.

366
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:38,922
You're punishing me

367
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:40,299
because you're jealous.

368
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,635
That would be petty.

369
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:44,201
I'm punishing you

370
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,058
because now you've joined my
best friend in lying to me.

371
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,473
Let me know when you're ready
to confess everything.

372
00:14:58,074 --> 00:15:00,586
These can become either hot
or cold.

373
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,681
As soon as it starts
to feel uncomfortable,

374
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:03,946
I want you to tell me.

375
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:05,081
But you don't think

376
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,457
there's something wrong
with me.

377
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:08,682
No, baby, they're testing you
to help Daddy.

378
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:10,026
Yes, what you're doing
is very important.

379
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:12,393
It's like the better you do,

380
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:14,295
the better we know your dad is.

381
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,766
I'll start with heat.

382
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,393
I know it's not his fault.

383
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:31,602
I know what he says
is involuntary,

384
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,043
but it doesn't help.

385
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:38,340
Inside,
he's still the same man.

386
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,242
That's the problem.

387
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,809
Apparently he's been thinking
this stuff all along.

388
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,313
Whoever that "same man" is,

389
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:46,382
it's not the person
I thought I was married to.

390
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:49,248
You okay?

391
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:54,066
She should be feeling
something by now.

392
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:55,583
What does that mean?
Is she sick too?

393
00:15:56,785 --> 00:16:01,392
Marika!
Honey!

394
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:02,701
You're burned.

395
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:03,662
Why didn't you tell me
it started to hurt?

396
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:04,764
I wanted to help Daddy.

397
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,332
You said the better I do,

398
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,341
the better Daddy has to be.

399
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:10,908
Sorry.

400
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:12,732
I'm starving.

401
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:15,402
Only way we can do
the test.

402
00:16:15,469 --> 00:16:17,546
Good thing it's you
and not Dr. Hadley.

403
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:20,249
Could you keep her
away from me?

404
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:23,705
I have a rich imaginative life.
I'd rather not share it.

405
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:25,688
We all have thoughts.

406
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:28,249
We all have sexual thoughts.

407
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:30,248
We have ignoble thoughts.

408
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:32,760
I just don't want those
to be who I am to people,

409
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:33,816
especially not to my wife.

410
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:34,950
I understand.

411
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,151
I don't think it would be fair

412
00:16:36,232 --> 00:16:37,287
to define me
by my passing thoughts.

413
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:38,757
My real choices
are my actions.

414
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:40,164
And I've never done anything
to hurt her.

415
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:41,619
I've never cheated.

416
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:45,156
You're kidding me.
You've cheated?

417
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:49,203
What? No.

418
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:50,675
Why would you say that?

419
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:52,736
Because you look guilty
as hell.

420
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:55,441
Are you serious?
Of course you're serious.

421
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:57,470
Yes, everyone knows.

422
00:16:57,534 --> 00:17:00,444
God, they must think
you're a creep.

423
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,835
They might not know.

424
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:04,139
They might be idiots.

425
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:05,146
I just say these things.

426
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:18,283
Why'd you page me here?

427
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:22,025
I need you to update me
on the patient's condition.

428
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,457
Seems to be dead.
Why'd you page me here?

429
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:28,422
I need you to update me
on the patient's condition

430
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,660
while hitting this
against the wall.

431
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:33,763
This is the only place
we can do both.

432
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:36,161
I finished
the last blood draw.

433
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:38,098
I expect the people
who work for me

434
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:39,426
to rise
to a challenge.

435
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:43,074
Unless they don't expect
to work for me.

436
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:03,617
Last blood draw
was at 6:00 A.M.

437
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:07,298
Sugar levels never rose
above 120 all night.

438
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:13,793
So the glucose was normal.

439
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,074
Means you were wrong
about diabetes.

440
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:17,842
I still think
it's the endocrine system.

441
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:19,698
Maybe I just got
the wrong gland.

442
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:23,680
So you're going for thyroid
instead of pancreas?

443
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:24,544
Makes sense.

444
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,546
Ow.

445
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:31,745
Fine.

446
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:34,482
I'm not playing racquetball
with Wilson.

447
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:36,161
I was never playing racquetball
with Wilson.

448
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:37,920
I have never played racquetball
with Wilson.

449
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,231
I thought it would be helpful

450
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:43,662
if a department head owed me
a favor.

451
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:45,423
But it's not worth this.

452
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:48,240
Not bad.

453
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:49,727
You put on a good show.

454
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:50,766
You studied up.

455
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:52,702
Wilson actually booked
a court.

456
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,501
If you were really
a racquetball player,

457
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:57,067
you'd know that you were holding
a squash racket.

458
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:02,041
Tell Kutner to do
a thyroid re-uptake scan,

459
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:05,768
Then go grab a nap
in one of the on-call rooms.

460
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,241
We're taking you to do
a thyroid re-uptake scan.

461
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,983
We think your--
- I'm not going anywhere

462
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:12,616
until you explain
why my daughter has

463
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,846
a bandage on her hand.

464
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:15,511
You just said you wanted
to run some test.

465
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:18,583
I'd known it would involve pain,
I'd have said, "hell, no."

466
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:20,086
It's a mild burn.

467
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:22,823
Since Marika has a neurological
disability like you,

468
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:24,567
we needed to make sure--
- She has no disability.

469
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:25,895
Nick, you know

470
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,064
about her problem
with auditory processing.

471
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:29,399
"Auditory processing"?

472
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:31,093
That's code for
"I can't stand thinking

473
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:32,469
my daughter's not perfect."

474
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,531
The therapist said
Marika's test scores--

475
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:36,467
were indeterminate.

476
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,277
She doesn't have a disability.

477
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:40,646
She daydreams.

478
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:41,638
She gets
below-average marks in school

479
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:44,742
because she's below average.

480
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:48,822
Nick!
- Do you have any idea

481
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,359
what the word average means?

482
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:51,558
Somebody has
to be under it.

483
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:53,188
Nick, shut up.

484
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:02,067
Oh, Honey...

485
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,195
I'm not saying
you're stupid.

486
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:07,395
Your mother's not the sharpest
crayon in the box,

487
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,841
and she does great.

488
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:15,505
See, this is why I told
your mother to keep you at home.

489
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,513
Didn't want you here.

490
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,480
Marika!

491
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:21,951
Marika, wait!

492
00:20:22,016 --> 00:20:23,583
Get her...

493
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:24,815
You're burning up.

494
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:29,853
And your lungs are full
of fluid. We need to get it out.

495
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,917
I need 200 milligrams
of furosemide

496
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,181
and two milligrams of morphine,
stat.

497
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:37,760
His temperature is 103.

498
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:39,158
Infection.

499
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:41,320
The steroids must have forced
it into the open.

500
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:42,664
What kind of infection?
- It could be anything.

501
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:44,856
Staph Aureus,
tuberculosis, strongyloides...

502
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:46,664
go back to Phineas,
get a history.

503
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:47,608
We've got a history. He
hasn't been out of the country.

504
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:48,935
Get a detailed history.

505
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,774
No one at home is sick.

506
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,436
No one at work is sick.

507
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:53,605
There's no sign
of ticks or mosquitoes.

508
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,165
Get a more detailed history.
Ask him again.

509
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:57,333
And again
until he remembers something.

510
00:20:57,412 --> 00:21:00,612
Not you.
Kutner can do it.

511
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:02,180
You're gonna be busy
with something else.

512
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:10,608
I'm here to invite you
to lunch.

513
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,089
Uh, why?

514
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:18,321
I've been made.

515
00:21:18,384 --> 00:21:21,359
House sent me back to you
as a double agent.

516
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,302
Anything wrong?

517
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:29,870
Eyes are a little red.

518
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:31,502
There's a shocker.

519
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:32,975
I haven't had
a good night's sleep

520
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,573
since this thing started.

521
00:21:34,638 --> 00:21:36,334
You should get some rest
yourself.

522
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:38,237
That's a good idea.

523
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:40,143
This is going to take
some time.

524
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,742
It'll be pretty exhaustive.

525
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:43,772
Are you afraid of what
you might say while I'm here?

526
00:21:43,854 --> 00:21:45,213
Yes.

527
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:46,717
Are you telling me

528
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:48,316
there's something worse
than what I've already heard?

529
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,090
No, I-I don't know
what I'm gonna say.

530
00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:54,218
I don't know
how I'm gonna hurt you next.

531
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:55,561
I think we should be
around each other

532
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,162
as little as possible
right now.

533
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:03,832
This is pathetic.

534
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:06,729
I know.

535
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:10,806
Tell Marika I love her very much.

536
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,071
She understands that.

537
00:22:12,137 --> 00:22:15,798
I don't think he does.

538
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,509
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

539
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:20,679
Yeah.

540
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:37,153
Guy leads a boring life.

541
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:38,625
They stay home a lot.

542
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,319
No travel,
no exotic pets,

543
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:41,584
no nearby standing water.

544
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:44,000
Can we get to that part?

545
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:46,224
His wife rescues dogs.

546
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:48,527
Among others, a big Rottweiler
who's taken over the house.

547
00:22:48,593 --> 00:22:50,368
Our patient hates it.

548
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:51,728
Was the wife there
to hear is?

549
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:53,693
No.
- Too bad. Keep going.

550
00:22:53,776 --> 00:22:56,975
The dog marks his territory
all over the living room.

551
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,270
I asked what the odds were
that he would have put down

552
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,413
food or drink
where the dog could reach.

553
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,605
He said he put a glass
of juice on the floor

554
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,773
while he was fixing
the television.

555
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:05,181
The dog was fixing
the television?

556
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:07,277
Yes.
- The patient's eyes red?

557
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:10,187
Yeah.
I'm thinking Weil's.

558
00:23:10,252 --> 00:23:11,723
Bacterial.
He lucked out.

559
00:23:11,788 --> 00:23:14,553
Start him on doxycycline.

560
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:16,616
If he improves,
we'll know we were right.

561
00:23:19,928 --> 00:23:22,022
I told Wilson you sent me
to get information.

562
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:23,960
And now you're telling me.

563
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:25,431
What does that make you,
a quadruple agent?

564
00:23:25,494 --> 00:23:29,221
He let me print out
his e-mails.

565
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:30,532
Wow. Excellent.

566
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:32,101
Information he wants us
to have.

567
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:34,230
Did he let you print out
his deleted e-mails?

568
00:23:34,294 --> 00:23:35,573
No.
- Then go back there--

569
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:36,934
As long
as I was sitting there,

570
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,964
I thought I'd print 'em
anyway.

571
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:41,381
Top one's the one
you're looking for.

572
00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:44,804
Writing to confirm Wednesday
at 7:00 P.M."

573
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:49,378
It's outgoing
to jgonzalez@nymcy.net.

574
00:23:49,443 --> 00:23:51,185
There's a Joan Gonzalez
in oncology.

575
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,321
It's a consult.

576
00:23:52,386 --> 00:23:55,522
Secret consult,
7:00 P.M.?

577
00:23:55,586 --> 00:23:58,816
Oh, Joan is perky.

578
00:23:58,882 --> 00:24:01,585
You're wrong. There was
a patient file attached.

579
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:02,656
Where?

580
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,033
It was password-protected.

581
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:05,600
No.

582
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:09,392
Wilson doesn't password-protect
his patient files.

583
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,328
I'm the only one he'd expect
ever to look there,

584
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:13,232
and he knows there's only one
patient I'd want to check on.

585
00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:15,999
You think Wilson's sick?

586
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:20,639
If Wilson had cancer,
there'd be no reason

587
00:24:20,703 --> 00:24:22,239
for him to drive three hours
to Manhattan.

588
00:24:22,303 --> 00:24:24,639
He could pull strings here
and get the best treatment.

589
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:26,640
Six articles by Gonzalez.

590
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,144
"Managing suicidal thoughts
in oncology patients,"

591
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:33,120
"Suicidal ideation
in children with leukemia."

592
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:36,863
I don't want to ask this,
but have you ever had reason

593
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:37,919
to think he might
be depressed?

594
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:40,686
No.
Get out of here.

595
00:24:52,998 --> 00:24:54,565
Your fever's down
and your lungs are clearing.

596
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:57,668
How long before
this brain thing goes away?

597
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,269
The infection's gone,

598
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:00,660
but the damage
the infection did...

599
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:02,196
you'll have to live with.

600
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:05,507
You're telling me
you can't fix this?

601
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:07,011
There's gotta be a way.

602
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:08,675
We'd need to remove
the damaged area

603
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:10,275
in our Cingulate Gyrus,

604
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:12,115
but it's too close to the
brainstem to risk surgery.

605
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,050
You can't risk it.

606
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:15,921
But I could shop around,

607
00:25:15,987 --> 00:25:18,385
and maybe some better doctors
at a better hospital--

608
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:21,426
The brain stem controls
the body's involuntary systems.

609
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,057
The slightest mistake
could kill you.

610
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,649
Even if you survive,

611
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,456
you may never be able
to breathe on your own again.

612
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:30,192
You may never--
- I get it.

613
00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:32,160
I know this seems like a lot
to deal with right now.

614
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:34,494
But people have adapted
to living

615
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:36,127
with all kinds
of neurological deficits.

616
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:39,134
Hey, at least we can promise
you it won't get any worse.

617
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:41,565
Get the hell
out of my room.

618
00:25:54,316 --> 00:25:56,777
Your assistant said that
you were out of the hospital,

619
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:58,747
taking a walk.

620
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:00,683
Is there an emergency?

621
00:26:00,748 --> 00:26:02,892
I don't know.
Is there?

622
00:26:02,957 --> 00:26:05,354
You never take a walk
unless you've got something

623
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:06,650
you need to think about.

624
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,993
Maybe you just don't have

625
00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:10,633
a good statistical sampling
of my walks.

626
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,760
The other thing you do
when you need to think

627
00:26:15,065 --> 00:26:16,999
apparently, this is something
you can only discuss

628
00:26:17,064 --> 00:26:18,469
with Gonzalez
at New York Mercy.

629
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:27,734
Taub. Another graduate of the
House school of being a dick.

630
00:26:27,814 --> 00:26:29,238
Private Dick.

631
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:30,439
Look, I'd love to stay
for the full inquisition,

632
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,679
but I need
some hot coffee.

633
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,653
Of course you need
hot coffee.

634
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,829
It's 45 degrees outside,
and you left your coat upstairs.

635
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,461
Why?

636
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:48,165
You're going to tell me
why I forgot my coat?

637
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:51,363
Once you get outside, the
cold would have reminded you.

638
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:53,763
You could have come back,
but you didn't.

639
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:55,859
You chose to be uncomfortable.

640
00:26:55,941 --> 00:26:58,468
Why would someone choose that?

641
00:27:00,737 --> 00:27:03,472
Because they hate themselves?

642
00:27:03,536 --> 00:27:04,878
Has it ever occurred to you
that when don't share

643
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:06,766
something, it might not
be meant as a challenge?

644
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:08,142
It might just mean

645
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:10,748
that I'd like there to be
one molecule of my life

646
00:27:10,814 --> 00:27:12,444
that goes unexamined
by Gregory House.

647
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:29,416
Nick Greenwald.

648
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:31,094
I hear you're the guy
in charge.

649
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,357
I'm the patient
with the disinhibition.

650
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:37,460
If you're here to say thanks,
you're welcome. Now go away.

651
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:39,364
Oh, I'm not thankful.
I'm pissed.

652
00:27:39,428 --> 00:27:42,690
Oh, all the more reason
to go away.

653
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,865
They're talking
about sending me home.

654
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:47,473
To what?

655
00:27:47,538 --> 00:27:49,041
A life where I'll continually
drive away

656
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:51,104
anyone who might
for a second care about me?

657
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,110
Those are the breaks.

658
00:27:58,332 --> 00:28:02,442
You could operate.

659
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:04,904
You could die.

660
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:06,983
So I'm either better
or dead?

661
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:08,774
I'm okay with that.

662
00:28:13,383 --> 00:28:16,579
I-I've always been
kind of a...

663
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:19,459
an impatient guy.

664
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:22,387
But I've worked hard
to keep my mouth shut.

665
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,586
I've made my wife happy.

666
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:25,553
I've made my little girl happy.

667
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:30,130
I want that back.

668
00:28:30,193 --> 00:28:31,888
Otherwise, it's no life.

669
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,071
I want you to remove a
small problem.

670
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:49,581
I'm not a neurosurgeon.

671
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,805
But your boss is.
You could assist.

672
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:53,610
I'm sure you'd like
to add to your resume.

673
00:28:53,677 --> 00:28:56,076
It's too near the brain stem.

674
00:28:56,157 --> 00:28:58,187
Nobody's gonna touch it.
- Your boss would.

675
00:28:58,253 --> 00:29:00,012
He's an egomaniac.

676
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:02,122
I know 'cause I keep seeing him
at the club.

677
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:03,915
He just needs
a little push.

678
00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:06,649
I'm sure by now you've kissed
his ass sufficiently.

679
00:29:10,235 --> 00:29:11,960
Would you like me
to phrase it

680
00:29:12,026 --> 00:29:15,624
as "you're politically gifted"?
I can do that.

681
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:20,503
You want me to help you?

682
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:23,270
Tell me why.
- Why what?

683
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:25,205
Why you care.

684
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,277
The puzzle's solved.

685
00:29:26,342 --> 00:29:27,766
The guy's alive.

686
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,509
And the odds of coming
out of this surgery

687
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:30,804
with that same status
aren't that great.

688
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,220
my patient has
a quality of life issue.

689
00:29:35,284 --> 00:29:37,474
He says awful things.
Hardly a medical condition.

690
00:29:37,554 --> 00:29:42,451
When he leaves here, he's...

691
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:44,418
he's gonna alienate
the people he works with.

692
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:46,448
And if he ever finds
a friend

693
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:48,096
who's willing to put up
with his crap,

694
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,857
he'll be lucky.

695
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:54,928
Until he drives
them away too.

696
00:29:59,437 --> 00:30:01,771
I'll see what I can do.

697
00:30:26,947 --> 00:30:30,146
You've apparently got
this whole coat thing backwards.

698
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:33,775
I may have overreacted.

699
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:36,191
You definitely overreacted.

700
00:30:36,256 --> 00:30:38,319
I knew you'd meet me
halfway.

701
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:39,488
It made me think.

702
00:30:39,552 --> 00:30:42,558
You only snap on one subject:

703
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:43,692
Losing people.

704
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,589
So I went back
to the intel.

705
00:30:46,654 --> 00:30:48,764
It's true there's only one
doctor named Gonzalez

706
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:49,836
At New York Mercy,

707
00:30:49,901 --> 00:30:51,900
But there's a Javier Gonzalez

708
00:30:51,964 --> 00:30:53,867
Who's a nurse
in the psych ward.

709
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:57,435
And who could you lose
who'd end up there?

710
00:30:57,499 --> 00:30:59,867
Maybe the reason
I don't always open up to you

711
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:01,437
is because it's redundant.

712
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:03,738
Daniel Wilson.

713
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:07,015
Once you got a name,
it's amazing how much stuff

714
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:09,207
you can learn on the phone.

715
00:31:09,271 --> 00:31:12,518
I mean, if you're a doctor
and you lie freely.

716
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,774
They found your brother sleeping
in the lobby

717
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:16,789
of an office building
in Manhattan.

718
00:31:16,854 --> 00:31:18,613
Got aggressive
when they asked him to leave,

719
00:31:18,678 --> 00:31:20,246
and the cops took him
to the Mercy psych ward.

720
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:22,692
There have been new
anti-psychotics developed

721
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:23,988
since he ran away.

722
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:25,155
He's been on them
for a couple of days.

723
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,357
And by tonight,

724
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:29,092
he should be in shape
to talk to me.

725
00:31:29,157 --> 00:31:30,932
But you're not sure
if he wants to.

726
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,931
I'll be in New York
in a few hours.

727
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:37,170
I guess I'll find out.

728
00:31:37,235 --> 00:31:38,770
Why wouldn't you
tell me this?

729
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:42,033
House, you and I...

730
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,770
we don't have
the normal social contract.

731
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:47,010
I don't expect you
to tell me the lies--

732
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,648
I am fully capable
of lying to you.

733
00:31:49,713 --> 00:31:50,881
I've lied plenty of times.

734
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:53,312
I mean, collaborative lies.

735
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,456
Giving someone a hand

736
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,512
who maybe needs
to deceive themselves

737
00:31:56,576 --> 00:32:00,479
just a little.

738
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,920
For two days I've been thinking

739
00:32:01,983 --> 00:32:03,613
about how Danny's gonna react
when he sees me.

740
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:07,389
If I said that to anybody else,
they'd say, "don't worry.

741
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:10,221
it'll all be all right."
You wouldn't.

742
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:13,995
Because it might all go
horribly wrong.

743
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:19,738
Yeah.

744
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,042
Yeah, it might.

745
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,465
In which case,
you might want some company.

746
00:32:31,578 --> 00:32:35,177
Your heart's beating.
First hurdle past.

747
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,291
Now we need know
if you can breathe for yourself.

748
00:32:41,163 --> 00:32:43,818
Oh, thank God.

749
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:47,434
Now, do you know
who you are?

750
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,426
Nick Greenwald.

751
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:52,424
Former S.O.B.

752
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:57,671
Thank you.

753
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,269
Now I can go back
to my beautiful life

754
00:32:59,336 --> 00:33:00,502
with my beautiful wife.

755
00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:04,244
Maybe she'll stop whining
and cut me some slack

756
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:06,342
now that I've risked
my life.

757
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,109
Doesn't make sense.

758
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:10,148
We removed the problem.

759
00:33:10,214 --> 00:33:11,445
We removed the damage.

760
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:12,787
Maybe we were wrong
about the problem.

761
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:14,579
I need to believe
we can get through this.

762
00:33:14,645 --> 00:33:16,691
Temperature's 94.5.

763
00:33:16,692 --> 00:33:18,481
Do you really think
I'm stupid?

764
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:20,512
Honey, you're not stupid.

765
00:33:20,592 --> 00:33:21,551
You' just--

766
00:33:21,617 --> 00:33:22,959
Please don't do this.

767
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:24,286
It could be the effect
of the surgery.

768
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:26,221
Do you at least respect me,
Nick

769
00:33:26,285 --> 00:33:27,516
What do you think
of what I do for a living?

770
00:33:27,582 --> 00:33:30,797
I think people who publicize
important things

771
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,901
are people who can't do

772
00:33:31,965 --> 00:33:34,236
important things themselves.

773
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:35,291
Honey, stop.

774
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:36,924
Don't.

775
00:33:37,006 --> 00:33:39,164
Do you regret marrying me?
- 94.2.

776
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:40,540
Sometimes.
Everybody wonders--

777
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:41,562
Get me a heating blanket.

778
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,468
Do you even love me?
- Yes.

779
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:50,314
Audrey, wait.
Let me--

780
00:33:51,452 --> 00:33:53,579
V-tach. Get me the paddles.

781
00:33:58,185 --> 00:33:59,176
Clear.

782
00:34:02,603 --> 00:34:04,535
Echo says his heart
is structurally fine.

783
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:05,640
But his temperature
is still dropping.

784
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:06,983
He's headed for hypothermia.

785
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:09,478
I can't reach House.
It just goes to voicemail.

786
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:11,814
It means we were wrong
about infection.

787
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:13,221
His temperature's just going
up and down

788
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:14,421
because something's playing
with his thermostat.

789
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:15,749
Which means
the brain damage is spreading.

790
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:16,982
What causes brain damage

791
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:18,084
and nose bleed
and involves the lungs,

792
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:19,125
heart and kidneys?

793
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:20,581
Cancer?

794
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:22,691
We could text him.
- It's not cancer.

795
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:24,691
Normal PSA, normal blood smear,
colonoscopy normal.

796
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,091
Do a full body scan.

797
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:28,563
House hates full body scans.

798
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:30,562
House isn't here.
- House is right.

799
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:32,497
Everybody's got three or four
meaningless anomalies

800
00:34:32,563 --> 00:34:33,858
that'll come up on a scan.

801
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,473
Chasing each one
will take time we don't have.

802
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:37,634
Feel free to send him
an IM.

803
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:25,670
You told me
you saw your brother once.

804
00:35:25,734 --> 00:35:27,109
after he disappeared.

805
00:35:27,174 --> 00:35:29,541
13 years ago.

806
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:31,236
I used to go to Princeton
whenever I could.

807
00:35:31,318 --> 00:35:34,211
I must have hit
every homeless shelter in town.

808
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:36,114
And then one day,
I'm just sitting at this deli,

809
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:38,483
having a sandwich,
I look out the window,

810
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:40,146
and there he is.

811
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:42,817
He was gone
by the time I got outside.

812
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:44,257
That's why you were so eager

813
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:45,888
when I told you
there was a job at Princeton.

814
00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:47,984
I thought
it was just my charm.

815
00:35:49,825 --> 00:35:51,615
That's the team.
Shouldn't you answer?

816
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:54,399
They already texted me to so
they're doing something stupid.

817
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:57,597
There's a small abdominal
aneurysm.

818
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:59,694
Irrelevant.
What else you got?

819
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:01,004
Cyst in the pleura
around the lungs.

820
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:02,171
Also irrelevant.

821
00:36:02,236 --> 00:36:03,657
Couldn't cause
any of the symptoms.

822
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:04,698
There's a density
in the liver.

823
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:06,329
Could be vascular malformation.

824
00:36:06,395 --> 00:36:08,105
If he's got multiple AVMs,

825
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:09,929
screwed-up blood flow
would explain everything.

826
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,642
We can only spot them
with angiography.

827
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:13,673
We'll have to do targeted scans
with contrast

828
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:14,872
and then embolize
each one.

829
00:36:14,938 --> 00:36:15,769
Can we do that
before he freezes?

830
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:18,681
We'll find out.

831
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:20,777
The spell-correct
on Kutner's phone

832
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:22,345
has got a hair trigger.

833
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,790
Either that, or the patient has
a cyclone in the floral

834
00:36:26,856 --> 00:36:29,719
of his lungs.

835
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:32,821
You took a walk
in 45-degree weather,

836
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:37,366
and you left your coat behind.

837
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:38,629
Go ahead.

838
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:41,825
I think you were punishing
yourself.

839
00:36:41,891 --> 00:36:43,201
I think you wanted to feel
what it would be like

840
00:36:43,265 --> 00:36:46,399
be homeless
a New Jersey winter.

841
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:50,463
That tells me guilt.

842
00:36:50,528 --> 00:36:51,967
That tells me
something happened.

843
00:36:55,775 --> 00:36:57,502
The schizophrenia started
when he was a teenager.

844
00:36:57,566 --> 00:37:00,172
When he was in college.

845
00:37:00,238 --> 00:37:02,908
He was on meds,
but he'd still think

846
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:04,811
a professor was out
to get him because he got a B,

847
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:07,147
or he'd fight with his roommates
because he never showered.

848
00:37:07,211 --> 00:37:08,154
Where were you?

849
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:10,650
Med school.

850
00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:14,746
He called me every day.

851
00:37:14,826 --> 00:37:17,194
Talked for hours.
I didn't have hours.

852
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:19,530
Interesting.

853
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:23,033
Later for that.
Go on.

854
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:25,000
I was tired
of being the guy

855
00:37:25,065 --> 00:37:28,664
that everybody counted on,
so one night, Danny called--

856
00:37:28,728 --> 00:37:32,870
one night, Danny called,
crying, upset about something.

857
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:33,893
I had to study
for an exam.

858
00:37:33,976 --> 00:37:38,101
So I-I hung up...

859
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,478
took my things.

860
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:40,614
I went to the library
so I wouldn't have

861
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,749
to hear the phone ring.

862
00:37:41,815 --> 00:37:43,814
I wonder
how that turned out.

863
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:45,941
My mother called
me the next day.

864
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:47,686
Danny had run away
and left his meds behind.

865
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:51,779
Which I knew meant
that he would never be able

866
00:37:51,844 --> 00:37:54,419
to choose to come back,

867
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:58,192
because he'd be so detached
from reality.

868
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,856
So you made your one effort
to live a normal, selfish life,

869
00:38:01,922 --> 00:38:04,528
and the universe immediately
smacked you down.

870
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:06,559
And because we're wired
to find meaning

871
00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:08,831
in semi-random events,
you decided never to be

872
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:10,158
that careless again.

873
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:13,468
You don't think
that's a little facile?

874
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:15,804
Actually, I don't.

875
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:19,564
I think you did it consciously.

876
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,963
You developed
your people-pleasing talents

877
00:38:21,964 --> 00:38:23,275
the way an Olympic athlete

878
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,514
develops his muscles.

879
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,673
Talk about an overreaction
to a single event.

880
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,849
It was a pretty big event.

881
00:38:29,915 --> 00:38:31,672
Hanging up the phone?

882
00:38:31,754 --> 00:38:33,721
That's what you're blaming
all this on.

883
00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:36,855
That's the behavior
you've been trying to correct.

884
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:39,478
As though nothing else went
wrong in your brother' life.

885
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,853
Of course,
he overreacted too, but...

886
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:47,188
his glucose was normal.

887
00:38:47,253 --> 00:38:50,164
We're not talking about
my brother anymore, are we?

888
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:56,771
It's House.

889
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:59,635
ADMs don't explain his glucose.

890
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,932
Since this is significant
moment in my life and all...

891
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:04,100
yeah.

892
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,810
I think I'll just go in then.

893
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:09,347
Explain that.
- Right.

894
00:39:09,412 --> 00:39:10,787
You'd given him steroids.

895
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,419
His glucose should have been
elevated.

896
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:15,986
That wannabe cyst you found
in the whole body scan,

897
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,353
without the glucose,
it's an irrelevant cyst.

898
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:22,321
He has Doege-Potter syndrome.

899
00:39:22,385 --> 00:39:25,791
His fibroma is secreting
human growth hormone,

900
00:39:25,856 --> 00:39:27,518
which acts like insulin,
lowering his glucose.

901
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,621
It doesn't explain the organ
failure or the brain damage.

902
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:33,197
This whole thing
is an overreaction.

903
00:39:33,263 --> 00:39:35,629
That one small fibroma.

904
00:39:35,694 --> 00:39:38,795
It's benign, but his body's
acting like it's an invader.

905
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,875
His antibodies went to war
against it

906
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:43,162
and got carried away,
attack his other systems.

907
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:45,579
Take out the fibroma,

908
00:39:45,642 --> 00:39:47,915
he'll be a happy hypocrite
again in no time.

909
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,177
Maybe I should call a cab.

910
00:39:57,258 --> 00:39:59,448
Your wife's
probably just late.

911
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:02,951
Yeah.

912
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:06,983
I'm sorry about...

913
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:09,026
you know...

914
00:40:09,094 --> 00:40:12,755
the things I said.

915
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:15,729
I have a conspicuous nose.

916
00:40:15,794 --> 00:40:17,425
It suits your face.

917
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:26,863
I'm sorry I'm late.

918
00:40:26,945 --> 00:40:28,241
Traffic.

919
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:36,977
I have some good news.

920
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:38,785
I was gonna tell you,
and then you got sick.

921
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:41,826
It didn't seem
like the best time.

922
00:40:41,891 --> 00:40:44,627
I've been offered
a better position.

923
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,754
I'd be coordinating
cancer awareness walks

924
00:40:46,817 --> 00:40:47,856
in three cities.

925
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:49,423
That's great.

926
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,359
Congratulations.

927
00:40:51,424 --> 00:40:53,933
I know you've worked hard
for this.

928
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:55,165
Thank you.

929
00:40:57,726 --> 00:41:00,268
# faith pours
from your walls #

930
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,163
Is Marika okay?

931
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,440
I'm sure she's moved on.

932
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:09,336
# you're not near #

933
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:13,079
Kids are so resilient.

934
00:41:19,014 --> 00:41:23,811
# remembering when I saw
your face #

935
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:26,082
# shining my way #

936
00:41:26,147 --> 00:41:32,112
# pure timing #

937
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:34,255
You okay?

938
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,886
I'll be seeing Danny again
next week.

939
00:41:37,951 --> 00:41:38,926
I'd like you to meet him.

940
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,021
Sure.

941
00:41:41,085 --> 00:41:42,332
He sounds interesting.

942
00:41:43,694 --> 00:41:45,228
Go on.

943
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,540
I thought seeing him again
would change everything.

944
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,172
It would be wonderful
or terrible.

945
00:41:50,237 --> 00:41:53,496
Instead...

946
00:41:53,562 --> 00:41:54,634
we're just strangers.

947
00:41:54,698 --> 00:41:57,769
It's kind of anticlimactic.

948
00:41:59,114 --> 00:42:01,144
Which is better
than terrible.

949
00:42:06,281 --> 00:42:08,455
Go on.

950
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:13,191
Does it bother you
that we have no social contract?

951
00:42:13,255 --> 00:42:15,383
My whole life
is one big compromise.

952
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:17,430
I tiptoe around everyone
like they're made of china.

953
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:19,255
I spend all my time analyzing:

954
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,788
What will the effect be
if I say this?

955
00:42:20,855 --> 00:42:21,860
Then there's you.

956
00:42:21,925 --> 00:42:23,652
You're a reality junkie.

957
00:42:23,734 --> 00:42:25,734
If I offered you
a comforting lie,

958
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:27,493
you'd smack me over the head
with it.

959
00:42:27,557 --> 00:42:30,437
Let's not change that.

960
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:31,460
Okay.

961
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:33,797
No, see, this--

962
00:42:33,877 --> 00:42:37,012
if you were implementing
the social contract,

963
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,013
you'd say that,

964
00:42:39,013 --> 00:42:41,378
but only because...

965
00:42:41,443 --> 00:42:45,184
it makes me feel better...

966
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,544
It is kind of fun
watching you torture yourself.

967
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,119
Do you think things
will work out with my brother?

968
00:42:51,184 --> 00:42:52,447
No.

969
00:42:52,512 --> 00:42:54,990
But when it does go wrong,

970
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:57,886
it won't be your fault.

971
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,429
Thanks, House.

972
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,924
You do
actually like monster trucks.

973
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:03,883
Absolutely.

974
