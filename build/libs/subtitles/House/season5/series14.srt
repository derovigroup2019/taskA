1
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:02,875
The trick to onions--

2
00:00:02,942 --> 00:00:04,143
cut them in half lengthwise,

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,512
but leave the roots on.

4
00:00:06,579 --> 00:00:09,007
Then make your
vertical slices.

5
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:13,752
Need a dozen.
Think you can handle this?

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,221
A dozen is 12, right?

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,824
Next, we add mustard greens--

8
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:21,760
spicy, and they pack a nice punch.

9
00:00:21,828 --> 00:00:24,029
Plus, they're really good for you.

10
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:25,964
Improve mental function,

11
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:28,000
protect against
rheumatoid arthritis.

12
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:31,203
Even inhibit certain types
of cancer.

13
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:32,404
Are you going to chop
those onions

14
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:33,972
or give them a Thai massage?

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,276
Well, I guess a happy ending
is out of the question.

16
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:39,144
<i>I don't recall adding</i>
<i>making snide remarks</i>

17
00:00:39,212 --> 00:00:42,181
to your list of duties.

18
00:00:42,248 --> 00:00:43,715
Just taking initiative.

19
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:46,985
Secret ingredient:
Porcini mushrooms.

20
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,755
You want to reconstitute them
in a bowl of water.

21
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:51,990
You also want to hire
an assistant

22
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:53,859
who can stay focused
for longer than 30 seconds.

23
00:00:53,927 --> 00:00:55,260
Why don't I hear you chopping?

24
00:00:55,328 --> 00:00:57,229
Just give me a second.

25
00:00:57,297 --> 00:00:59,631
You're kidding me, right?

26
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,034
So sorry.
- Are you okay? You want to sit down?

27
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:04,269
My lips are blue.
Cyanosis.

28
00:01:04,337 --> 00:01:06,738
Pain in my back and chest.

29
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:08,674
Spontaneous pneumothorax.

30
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:10,642
What are you talking about?
- I'm a doctor.

31
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,444
You are?
- And I need a doctor.

32
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:03,195
You drool.

33
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:06,064
Shut up.

34
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:04,756
I know gas is expensive,

35
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:06,591
but I could've given you a ride.

36
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:09,161
Elevator's broken.

37
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:10,495
It was fine when I came up

38
00:03:10,563 --> 00:03:12,097
from admitting.

39
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:13,565
Dana Miller, the cancer researcher.

40
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:16,735
Spontaneous pneumothorax.
- Awfully thin file.

41
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:18,337
She just got admitted.

42
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:20,105
Lots of things can cause
pneumothorax.

43
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:21,673
Why don't we let
eight or ten other doctors

44
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:22,708
rule out the boring stuff?

45
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:24,009
We wanna take this case.

46
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:25,677
She's maybe five or ten years away

47
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,112
from curing retinoblastoma.

48
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,748
Which would make this case
attractive to anyone

49
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:32,851
who has some vested interest
in people curing the incurable.

50
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,685
<i>She hasn't suffered</i>
<i>from COPD.</i>

51
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:35,020
She doesn't smoke.

52
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:36,855
She hasn't been scuba diving.

53
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:38,724
<i>O2 Sats are low even after</i>
<i>chest tube insertion.</i>

54
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,026
Pneumothorax could be secondary
to a bunch of things.

55
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:42,661
<i>Cystic fibrosis,</i>
<i>lung cancer.</i>

56
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:45,263
Or, to be slightly
more optimistic,

57
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,566
<i>late-onset asthma triggered</i>
<i>by an unknown allergen.</i>

58
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,234
<i>We have a case?</i>
- Did you just get to work?

59
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:50,635
Am I in trouble?

60
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:54,039
Did you take the elevators up?
- Yes.

61
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:56,274
So, steroids for asthma?

62
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:58,176
Yeah.

63
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:01,646
Do a CT looking for
hyperinflation to confirm.

64
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:09,354
I thought my hospital was high-tech.

65
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:11,089
I'd have to wait all day for a CT.

66
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:12,991
Dr. House gets a few perks.

67
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:14,693
He has his own scanner?

68
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:17,229
No, just very loose interpretations

69
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:18,597
of hospital procedure.

70
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:20,599
I appreciate the extra effort,
but--

71
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,000
<i>Our gift to society.</i>

72
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:23,835
we want to get you back to work
as soon as possible.

73
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:26,204
Well, I'm not working.

74
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:28,140
At least not as a doctor.

75
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:29,941
I quit.

76
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,245
I left eight months ago.

77
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:35,213
You mean, like, a sabbatical?

78
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:38,083
I had a uterine myoma.
Benign.

79
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:41,686
But it ruptured and
I needed emergency surgery.

80
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:43,321
I was lying there
on the table thinking,

81
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,457
"I can't die now.
I haven't been happy yet."

82
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:49,327
Couldn't you just buy
an overpriced German sports car,

83
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:50,929
or have an affair?

84
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:54,766
My sports car is doing
what I want when I want.

85
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,301
Right now I'm learning
how to run a kitchen

86
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:57,669
from one of the best chefs
in New York.

87
00:04:57,737 --> 00:05:01,173
You're washing pots
and smashing garlic?

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,375
Smashing garlic makes me happy.

89
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:05,477
<i>Before that it was</i>
<i>eight years studying,</i>

90
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:06,812
<i>12 years in that lab.</i>

91
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,780
It was always
what I was <i>supposed</i> to do,

92
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:10,315
and never what I <i>wanted</i> to do.

93
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:23,895
Come here.
Look at this.

94
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:26,231
<i>Come here.</i>

95
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:33,338
Adorable.
Elevators keep crashing.

96
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,440
Is mercury in retrograde
or what?

97
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:37,142
Elevators can be capricious.

98
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,345
Sometimes it just seems like
they're out to get you.

99
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:41,713
She keeps playing
with the blanket.

100
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:42,814
Why would she do that?

101
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:44,916
Why do you think
the elevators

102
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:46,451
would be out to get me?

103
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,886
I don't know.

104
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:50,455
Maybe they wanted to take time off

105
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:52,224
to spend with
their little dumbwaiter.

106
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,526
<i>But they the had to leave it</i>
<i>at home with an elevator sitter</i>

107
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:56,461
because you drove
the replacement elevator

108
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:58,730
<i>to quitting</i>

109
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:01,233
<i>because you're incapable</i>
<i>of listening to anybody but me.</i>

110
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,034
That's just a theory.

111
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:05,504
You're wrong.
I don't even listen to you.

112
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:08,240
Either do your job or go home.
Leave me out of it.

113
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:09,541
I am gonna do my job.

114
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:11,109
It doesn't mean
I have to do it happily.

115
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:13,311
<i>Doesn't mean I have to do it</i>
<i>without resentment.</i>

116
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,013
And it definitely doesn't mean
I have to do it

117
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:17,782
without seeking vengeance
on the person making me be here.

118
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,484
Congratulations.

119
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:21,620
You've officially dragged me
down to your level.

120
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:24,789
Okay.

121
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:50,448
Hey, Blue.

122
00:06:58,024 --> 00:06:59,224
<i>It's not asthma. </i>

123
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,159
Lung volume is normal.

124
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:03,895
She did have a uterine myoma
removed eight months ago.

125
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:06,431
Central line IV could have
made a hole near the lung

126
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:08,099
at slowly expanded.

127
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,367
No pleural thickening.

128
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:11,536
I can't believe she quit.

129
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:14,706
People have the right
to be happy.

130
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:16,074
I saw a four-year-old
with retinoblastoma

131
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:18,143
on my oncology rotation.

132
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:20,979
The cancer had eaten through
her eye and into her brain.

133
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:22,314
Horrible diseases exist.

134
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:23,782
It doesn't mean people
should give up

135
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:25,283
recreational anything.

136
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:26,751
Why not?
Big picture--

137
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,220
I don't care
if Jonas Salk's life

138
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:29,487
is a miserable shell.

139
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,056
I just want him to cure polio.

140
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:32,924
You can't live your life
"big picture."

141
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:34,059
You've gotta look out
for yourself

142
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:35,193
and the people you care about.

143
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:37,028
Well, then, why are you a doctor?

144
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:37,996
Why aren't you sitting
by a pool in Fiji

145
00:07:38,064 --> 00:07:39,464
knocking back Mai Tais?

146
00:07:39,532 --> 00:07:41,199
People act in their own
self-interests.

147
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,401
You're all here because
you're <i>happy</i> to be here.

148
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:45,003
Or at least because
it's your best option.

149
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:46,104
I'm here because
I want to help people.

150
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:48,273
No, you're here because

151
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:50,642
it makes you feel good
to help people.

152
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,043
<i>Taub and Foreman</i>
<i>are here because</i>

153
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:53,712
<i>they've got no other</i>
<i>viable choices.</i>

154
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,180
And Thirteen is desperate
to make her life matter

155
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:57,849
before it's over.

156
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,918
So...you're happy to be here?

157
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:01,286
Does it show?

158
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:06,157
Are those...
increased interstitial markings?

159
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:07,959
Could be pulmonary fibrosis.

160
00:08:08,027 --> 00:08:09,861
Do a biopsy.

161
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:13,431
Foreman.

162
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:19,838
"You've got to look out
for the people you care about."

163
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:21,339
That wouldn't have anything
to do with you

164
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:23,241
screwing over your clinical trial

165
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,377
by slipping Thirteen
the real drug, would it?

166
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:28,213
You said that would be stupid.

167
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:30,081
Does she know?

168
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:32,217
Because Jonas Salk would not approve.

169
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:35,053
There's nothing to know.

170
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,060
Got it?

171
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,466
Good?
- Yep.

172
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:50,735
You okay?

173
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:53,471
Just a headache.
I took some ibuprofen, but--

174
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:54,439
Where's the pain:
Front or back?

175
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:55,707
Front.

176
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:56,975
Why are there never any
interesting pictures

177
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,310
on these cards?

178
00:08:58,377 --> 00:09:00,345
They should make a dirty version.

179
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,447
A sharp pain,
or more of a throbbing--

180
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:06,451
Relax, it's not a side effect.
People get headaches.

181
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,953
True, but I can get you an MRI.

182
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:11,022
If I'm on the drug, it's been weeks.

183
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,059
It's not like something's going
to suddenly crop up now.

184
00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:16,828
Okay.

185
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:19,564
First card.

186
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:23,468
Train, duck...

187
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:24,869
You can't remember?

188
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:27,205
Piano.

189
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:31,376
We need a biopsy to confirm--

190
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:34,579
You need an open-lung biopsy
to confirm pulmonary fibrosis.

191
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:36,681
That's invasive surgery.

192
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:38,383
I'd be out of commission
for weeks.

193
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:41,052
No offense,
but you're not working.

194
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,787
What does it matter if
you spend a little time in bed?

195
00:09:42,855 --> 00:09:44,956
Not working doesn't mean
I don't have places to go.

196
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:47,759
<i>I've got my book group,</i>
<i>piano lessons, cooking classes.</i>

197
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:49,227
They make me happy.

198
00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:51,196
A warm apple fritter makes me happy.

199
00:09:51,263 --> 00:09:53,231
It doesn't fulfill me as a person.

200
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,532
And working here does?

201
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,633
If it didn't, I'd have found a way

202
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:56,401
to go back to tucking tummies.

203
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:57,836
Well, good for you.

204
00:09:57,903 --> 00:10:00,538
If your job fulfills you and
makes you happy, that's rare.

205
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:03,675
I didn't say I was happy.

206
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:05,777
I loved being a plastic surgeon.

207
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:08,413
The money, the lifestyle.

208
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,582
And in a lot of ways this job stinks.

209
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:14,886
Not making five bucks,
I'm always annoyed...but--

210
00:10:14,954 --> 00:10:17,288
You can look yourself
in the mirror and think,

211
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:19,290
"I did something
worthwhile today."

212
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:21,793
Exactly.

213
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,996
Well, that's important.
And I do miss that.

214
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:28,600
But it just wasn't enough
anymore.

215
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:36,007
That doesn't feel right.

216
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:37,342
Sit up.

217
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,677
Ow! Oh, that's weird.

218
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:44,549
What is it? Ascites?

219
00:10:48,154 --> 00:10:49,154
Ow!

220
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:51,256
Your belly's full of blood.

221
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:58,764
First her lung deflates,
like me after a cold shower.

222
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:01,767
Now her liver starts to bleed,
like me after--

223
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:08,274
You okay?

224
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,809
<i>Great.</i>

225
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:14,380
Just practicing
my clown college audition.

226
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:17,483
Someone set a trip wire.

227
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,218
We were with the patient
the whole time.

228
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:20,820
We were in the GRC.

229
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:23,189
Lung, liver, go.

230
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:25,057
Shouldn't you be obsessing
over who did this to you?

231
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,392
<i>Nope--anybody bother</i>

232
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,093
MRIing our patient's liver
for tumors?

233
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:31,397
Uh, no tumors, no cysts,
no clear etiology.

234
00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:34,700
If you're not obsessing,

235
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:37,336
<i>you must have already</i>
<i>figured it out.</i>

236
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:38,704
<i>Yes.</i>

237
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:40,105
So I'm obsessing about why
you're not obsessing

238
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:42,341
about why our patient's liver
suddenly sprang a leak.

239
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,877
There's a tiny spot on the caudate lobe.

240
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:46,245
Could be a granuloma.

241
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:48,280
Erodes into the hepatic artery,

242
00:11:48,348 --> 00:11:49,682
causes the bleed.

243
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:51,217
What caused the granuloma?

244
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:53,485
Blastomycosis.

245
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:54,987
<i>Could have been asymptomatic</i>
<i>for months.</i>

246
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:57,823
It hits her lungs,
we give her steroids.

247
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,992
It blossoms and attacks her liver.

248
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,361
Get a piece of her lung,
stick it under a black light.

249
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:05,764
If it glows, sick children
who need her souffles

250
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:07,433
<i>can breathe easier.</i>

251
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,468
<i>Foreman.</i>

252
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,241
Again?

253
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:16,976
You have a problem.

254
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:18,110
I told you, I didn't--

255
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:20,379
Then you really have a problem.

256
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:23,148
They way she turned her head
to look at the MRI...

257
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:24,617
I think she's losing
her peripheral vision.

258
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:27,186
Because she turned her head?

259
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:29,488
I'm happy for you.

260
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:32,358
A love so deep you're ready
to chuck your medical license

261
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:33,893
to give her powerful, unproven drugs

262
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,595
with dangerous side effects.

263
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:37,796
I don't want to make
any assumptions

264
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:39,164
about your feelings for me,

265
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:41,467
but I do have a birthday
coming up.

266
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:57,049
I hear Cuddy's <i>seal</i> training
finally came in handy.

267
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:59,351
Should I be investing
in a flak jacket?

268
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:00,686
You're safe.

269
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:03,255
No carpet bombing?

270
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:07,426
No burning of Dresden
to teach her a lesson?

271
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,528
Well, since you're incapable
of taking the high road,

272
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,664
I assume there's
some deeper,

273
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:13,766
more long-term strategy
in effect.

274
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,634
Cuddy's not playing games.

275
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:17,603
She's not looking for leverage.

276
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,039
She wants pure,
unadulterated vengeance.

277
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:22,942
And your counter-move is
to let her have it?

278
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:25,544
The only time to strike back
is when I want something.

279
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:28,380
All I want now is
to get things back to normal.

280
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:30,215
Which I can't get by escalating.

281
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:32,785
The only way to win this war
is to lose it.

282
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:34,420
Let her punch herself out.

283
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:37,656
Yeah, that makes sense too.

284
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:39,758
"Too"?

285
00:13:39,826 --> 00:13:40,960
I was thinking you actually feel guilty

286
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:42,728
About taking her away from her baby.

287
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:45,097
But your explanation's good too.

288
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:49,068
It's completely inconsistent
with your character, but...

289
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:50,703
Thank you, rationalization man.

290
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,038
You have saved the village.

291
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:55,474
You wanna eat?

292
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,543
You forgot your file.

293
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,279
Dana Miller?

294
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,014
The cancer researcher?

295
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:03,415
Not anymore.

296
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:15,594
Dr. Miller, I doubt
if you'll remember me--

297
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:16,996
James Wilson, right?
Chicago.

298
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:18,530
The adenocarcinoma conference.

299
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,200
Impressive.

300
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:23,268
You want some cortisone for that itch?

301
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:25,004
Liver failure.

302
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:26,872
Itching is one of
the lovely side effects.

303
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,609
Why did you quit?

304
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:34,046
The worst thing is
is now every time I get sick,

305
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:35,881
I have to listen
to a dozen people judge me.

306
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:39,418
Do you want me
to congratulate you?

307
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:41,153
I've got four kids
in PED-ONC right now

308
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:42,354
who are gonna die.

309
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:43,789
Three of them within a year,

310
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:45,090
the other in a few days,
probably.

311
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:47,092
Breakthroughs will happen.

312
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,661
With or without me,
someone will find the answer.

313
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:52,631
Maybe.

314
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:54,967
I--I...

315
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:56,268
I'm in the trenches.

316
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:58,637
I'm--I'm doing triage
as best I can.

317
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:03,008
You had the chance
to end the <i>war.</i>

318
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,810
How is someone like me
supposed to keep fighting

319
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:08,013
when someone like you just...
walked away?

320
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:11,316
When I left my job,

321
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:13,585
a lot of people were furious
with me.

322
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:18,223
<i>It was easier to be angry than</i>
<i>to admit they weren't happy.</i>

323
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,893
that they were stuck in a rut
somewhere in their lives,

324
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,929
unable to move forward.

325
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:25,831
What's your rut?

326
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,013
Okay, you're freaking me out.

327
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:44,049
Do you think
we should have kids?

328
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:52,958
We've had this conversation.
- Ten years ago.

329
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:54,493
Things change.

330
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:57,563
On our third date I told you
that I didn't want to have kids,

331
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,531
and you said that
you were okay with that.

332
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,300
I said it because
I wanted to sleep with you.

333
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:03,235
And then I fell in love with you.

334
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:08,073
And I realized that I really
could be okay with it.

335
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:11,710
It wasn't like I had this
burning desire to have children.

336
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:13,946
God, have you been
resenting me all this time?

337
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:16,348
Is that why--
- No.

338
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,384
Of course not.

339
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:22,554
I'm just...revisiting.

340
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:29,761
This isn't a whim for me.

341
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:32,464
It's not a decision
that I made lightly.

342
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:33,832
Don't you ever wonder
what it would be like?

343
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,170
All the time.

344
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:40,172
Just not enough to make me
want to do it.

345
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,609
I like our life.

346
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:48,647
Are you okay?

347
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:54,553
Could you turn the TV
back on?

348
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:14,173
Look straight ahead.

349
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,975
Why didn't we
do this test this morning?

350
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:18,243
You see that?

351
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:21,180
No.
- Damn.

352
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:25,851
I'm losing my peripheral vision?

353
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:30,856
I am on the drug.

354
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,659
Does this mean
you have to tell them

355
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:34,826
and take me off it?

356
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:38,530
No, and yes.

357
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:42,234
As far as they're concerned,
you're on the placebo.

358
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:43,702
I found out last week.

359
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,606
The trial was getting
positive results...

360
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:49,374
so I switched you.

361
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,313
So my headaches...

362
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:01,687
I'll stop taking the drug,
and everything should be fine.

363
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:10,462
Specimen's negative for blastomycosis.

364
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,763
That's it?

365
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:14,967
I'll go give House the test results.

366
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:16,635
You can tell the patient.

367
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,870
Hey.

368
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,543
We've been dating for two weeks.

369
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:29,114
You just broke trial protocol
and risked your entire career

370
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:32,217
to give me a drug we're
not even sure will help me.

371
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:37,389
I don't think I'm ready for that.

372
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:47,399
Dr. Miller?

373
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:50,602
Mm...
- I'm sorry.

374
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,304
The test was negative.

375
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:53,639
So I'm gonna take you off--

376
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:55,841
what happened to your head?

377
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:58,677
I don't know. I was sleeping.

378
00:18:58,745 --> 00:18:59,745
It's so itchy.

379
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:01,246
You were scratching it
in your sleep.

380
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:06,952
You scratched
right through your skull.

381
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,355
This is brain matter.

382
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:11,923
Need some help in here!

383
00:19:12,814 --> 00:19:13,147
I did a free flap closure
to avoid any scarring.

384
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:14,715
Scarring.

385
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:16,884
She was lucky--the scratching
didn't cause any brain damage.

386
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:18,519
But the first thing she said
when we woke her up was

387
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:19,820
it still itches.

388
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:22,189
Itch receptors are only

389
00:19:22,257 --> 00:19:24,158
in the top two layers of skin.

390
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:25,759
Which means she's not actually itchy,

391
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:27,027
she just thinks she is.

392
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:28,495
So the problem's in her brain?

393
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:29,730
Thank God we have you here
to interpret that for us.

394
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,667
Sorry, I have a headache.

395
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:35,903
<i>Could be psychogenic.</i>

396
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,538
<i>She made big, sudden change</i>
<i>in her life.</i>

397
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:38,705
<i>Could be the result</i>
<i>of a mental imbalance.</i>

398
00:19:38,773 --> 00:19:40,407
She wants to do
what she wants to do.

399
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:42,176
What's crazy about that?

400
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:43,510
<i>Why do you have to quit</i>
<i>to do it?</i>

401
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:44,978
If I want to do something,
I do it.

402
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:46,713
If you can figure out a balance,
there's no burnout.

403
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:48,448
Thanks for the lesson, deep.

404
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:51,218
The itching started yesterday,
not eight months ago.

405
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:53,720
Meningitis, encephalitis...

406
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:55,756
Those are diffuse processes.
This is localized.

407
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:57,858
<i>Could be plaques.</i>

408
00:19:57,926 --> 00:19:59,426
MS would explain,
possibly the lungs.

409
00:19:59,494 --> 00:20:00,894
So would a brain tumor.

410
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:01,929
Well, how 'bout we stop guessing

411
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:04,264
and MRI her head instead?

412
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:28,388
You want to talk about
your headaches?

413
00:20:28,456 --> 00:20:31,258
Not particularly.

414
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:34,361
You went off the drug,
but the headaches are worse.

415
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:36,063
You need an MRI.

416
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,398
The patient needs an MRI.

417
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,900
If she had gangrene,
would you be amputating my leg?

418
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:41,869
Those pills have codeine in them?

419
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:44,137
You're taking twice the indicated amount.

420
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:46,673
I've only been off the drug
for 24 hours,

421
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:48,075
So I think
the bigger issue here

422
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:49,843
is that I've been off you
for 24 hours.

423
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:52,579
You have worsening headaches,
loss of peripheral vision,

424
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:55,115
and a long history of pretending
bad things aren't happening.

425
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:57,684
You really think this is just
about my hurt feelings?

426
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,197
I don't remember demoting you.

427
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:12,332
I brought you something.

428
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,734
The latest issue
of <i>Parent</i> Magazine.

429
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:16,470
Really interesting column.

430
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:18,538
Apparently, working moms
are actually more engaged

431
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:19,973
and attentive than stay-at-home moms.

432
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,942
Something about personal fulfillment.

433
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,245
That's just a rationalization
by working moms to justify

434
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:26,546
not being with their kids.

435
00:21:26,614 --> 00:21:27,781
Which is fine,
if that's what they want.

436
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:29,383
It's not what I want.

437
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,851
And this is <i>Nurses Quarterly.</i>

438
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:33,320
The point is--
- You're only here to get back at me

439
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:35,689
by dumping dirty mop water
on my carpet.

440
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:37,891
Just get it over with
so I can get back to work.

441
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:03,350
I'm sorry.

442
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:05,152
I figured...

443
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:09,923
<i>I don't know, one of us needed</i>
<i>to go out on a limb.</i>

444
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:12,926
<i>I thought I could help you.</i>

445
00:22:12,994 --> 00:22:15,228
It's hard to have a conversation

446
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,430
when I'm trying not to move.

447
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:25,906
Oh, God.

448
00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:29,076
Patient's MRI was negative.

449
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:30,277
No tumors, no lesions.

450
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:31,311
Where's your cane?

451
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:32,779
Where are your coworkers?

452
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:33,914
I paged them.

453
00:22:33,982 --> 00:22:34,982
It could still be psychogenic.

454
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,217
Technically, it can't still be that,

455
00:22:37,285 --> 00:22:41,154
because it never could be that.

456
00:22:41,222 --> 00:22:43,690
Unless she was having
a dream about fleas--

457
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:45,759
Oh, hey!
Funny you should drop by.

458
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:47,694
<i>We were just talking</i>
<i>about this patient of ours.</i>

459
00:22:47,762 --> 00:22:50,063
Tell him the part
about where two of her doctors

460
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:51,531
don't show up--
Where are you going?

461
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,100
Polyneuropathy.

462
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,668
If it's not in the brain,
it's in the nerves.

463
00:22:54,736 --> 00:22:56,336
It explains the itching,
the lungs, the liver.

464
00:22:56,404 --> 00:22:58,005
Shock the affected area,
reboot the nerve--

465
00:22:58,072 --> 00:22:59,606
She'll be fine.

466
00:22:59,674 --> 00:23:00,774
<i>Foreman.</i>

467
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:05,579
How bad is she?

468
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:14,421
She's got a tumor
in her optic chiasm.

469
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:15,956
You don't need your coat
to treat a tumor.

470
00:23:16,024 --> 00:23:17,758
I'm going to the drug company.

471
00:23:17,825 --> 00:23:20,694
To tell them that you
compromised their trial,

472
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:22,095
your ethics,
and the patient's health?

473
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:23,597
That's a great idea.

474
00:23:23,664 --> 00:23:25,632
They have records
on hundreds of patients.

475
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,501
I can ask them for access,

476
00:23:27,568 --> 00:23:29,169
find out if other patients
developed tumors

477
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:30,270
and how they were treated.

478
00:23:30,338 --> 00:23:32,039
This drug inhibits cell death.

479
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:33,407
I think I could take a wild guess

480
00:23:33,474 --> 00:23:34,408
at how I treat that.

481
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:35,842
Stop taking it?

482
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,210
Yeah.

483
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:38,445
She tried that yesterday.

484
00:23:38,513 --> 00:23:40,313
Oh, my God, it's been a whole day,

485
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:41,948
And her brain tumor hasn't melted away?

486
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:44,851
If you get on that elevator,

487
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,253
and it's only
'cause you're worried

488
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,621
about getting to sleep tonight--

489
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:49,089
I want to be able
to tell her

490
00:23:49,157 --> 00:23:50,724
this happened to other people,
and they're fine now.

491
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,025
So tell her.

492
00:23:52,093 --> 00:23:53,560
I'm not gonna lie to her.

493
00:23:53,628 --> 00:23:54,895
A little late for that.

494
00:23:58,032 --> 00:24:00,233
You need to wait.

495
00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:01,802
Because if this thing
doesn't go away,

496
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:03,904
she's gonna need you
to still have a medical license.

497
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:10,077
So I spoke with House.

498
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:11,511
He thinks we should just--

499
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:13,113
My leg is bleeding.

500
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:15,148
What happened?

501
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:16,183
I was going for the phone,

502
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,552
and I fell over the table.

503
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:21,555
I can't see.

504
00:24:21,622 --> 00:24:23,390
What do you mean?

505
00:24:25,193 --> 00:24:26,326
I can't see anything.

506
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,228
You gonna tip housekeeping?

507
00:24:45,295 --> 00:24:47,697
Get it from Cuddy.

508
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:48,965
Don't tell me--

509
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:51,567
She burned your apartment
to the ground.

510
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:52,902
The warmth would have been nice.

511
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,771
No heat, no power.

512
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,808
Apparently Mrs. House
called the utilities

513
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,042
and told them we were moving.

514
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,678
You have 17 messages.

515
00:25:02,746 --> 00:25:04,747
And your non-involvement strategy

516
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:06,382
doesn't seem to be working.

517
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:13,155
Hang up, he's here.

518
00:25:16,426 --> 00:25:18,027
We've been paging you all night.

519
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:19,295
By all means, let's discuss

520
00:25:19,363 --> 00:25:20,730
the failed attempts to contact me,

521
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:23,065
not the reason behind them.

522
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:25,134
Patient started experiencing
spinal shocks

523
00:25:25,202 --> 00:25:26,335
before the machine was turned on.

524
00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:27,436
Lhermitte's sign.

525
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:30,006
Shocks without shock,

526
00:25:30,073 --> 00:25:31,807
An itch that won't stop.

527
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,776
She needs Dr. Seuss.

528
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:35,878
Lhermitte's sign could mean
behcet's, B-12 deficiency.

529
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:37,780
No sores, no anemia.

530
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:39,615
Where's Foreman?
<i>- No idea.</i>

531
00:25:39,683 --> 00:25:41,851
Could be another
demyelinating disease.

532
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,020
Why are you asking
about Foreman and not Thirteen?

533
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:48,190
Because both questions are bound
to have the same answer.

534
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:50,793
Ebony and Ivory
are joined near the hip.

535
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:52,528
Forget the brain.
Look lower.

536
00:25:52,596 --> 00:25:55,131
The spinal tumor wouldn't
explain the liver or the lungs.

537
00:25:55,198 --> 00:25:57,500
But an aggressive
spinal hemangioma could.

538
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:59,602
Go find it.

539
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:17,586
You didn't answer the door.

540
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:20,489
Probably because I didn't
want to talk to anyone.

541
00:26:20,557 --> 00:26:23,192
You can leave your stolen key
on your way out.

542
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,460
I was looking for Foreman.

543
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:25,895
I figured...

544
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:30,166
You can't see.

545
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:34,837
Where is he?

546
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:36,205
On his way to the drug company.

547
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:37,606
Tell him to come back.

548
00:26:37,674 --> 00:26:38,774
I'll dial.

549
00:26:38,842 --> 00:26:39,775
If they can help.

550
00:26:39,843 --> 00:26:41,310
You think that drug company

551
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:43,980
has a magic tumor wand
that no one else knows about?

552
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:45,247
You need radiation,

553
00:26:45,315 --> 00:26:47,049
not ritual sacrifice.

554
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:52,855
He asked for my advice

555
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:55,391
before he switched you
off the placebo.

556
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:58,160
I told him to do it if he loved you.

557
00:26:58,228 --> 00:27:02,264
He only thinks he loves me.

558
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:03,332
It's the same thing.

559
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,501
Yes, he's an idiot.

560
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:06,769
You didn't ask him
to do anything.

561
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:07,803
You're pissed off that he did.

562
00:27:07,871 --> 00:27:09,638
So let him torch his career

563
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:10,573
to pay for his sins.

564
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:15,811
Unless you actually
feel something for the idiot.

565
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:21,417
In which case, you might
want to tell him to turn around.

566
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:37,266
<i>You're hurting him.</i>

567
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:40,169
Good, after all the stunts
he's pulled on me.

568
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:42,204
You're physically hurting him.

569
00:27:42,272 --> 00:27:43,973
That's the point.

570
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,441
What's the point?

571
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:48,010
What do you think
you're going to accomplish?

572
00:27:48,078 --> 00:27:49,979
House shouldn't be allowed
to make people miserable

573
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:51,680
without paying for it.

574
00:27:51,748 --> 00:27:54,116
You're not miserable!
- You're telling me how I feel?

575
00:27:54,184 --> 00:27:56,118
You're here
because you like this.

576
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:57,520
You like working with him.

577
00:27:57,587 --> 00:27:59,822
Wow, if only I'd known
I was having fun,

578
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,290
I wouldn't have canceled
the bouncy house.

579
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:04,593
Fire him, and go be home
with your new baby.

580
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:06,762
I like what he does
for this hospital.

581
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,499
What he does is who he is.

582
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:11,534
And the same goes for you.

583
00:28:21,244 --> 00:28:23,646
Slow down.

584
00:28:23,713 --> 00:28:26,682
Unless you want to radiate
her heart instead of her brain.

585
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,784
Of course, then your problems
would actually all go away.

586
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:30,486
Thanks.

587
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:33,589
I'm not beating myself up
enough already over this.

588
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:36,058
Entering the left common carotid.

589
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:37,993
You broke the rules.

590
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:39,995
Girlfriend went blind.

591
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:41,464
<i>You gotta be ready</i>
<i>for losing</i>

592
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:43,299
<i>To be one</i>
<i>of the possibilities.</i>

593
00:28:43,366 --> 00:28:45,734
You're at the carotid bifurcation.

594
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:47,336
<i>I knew that</i>
<i>giving her the drug</i>

595
00:28:47,404 --> 00:28:48,704
would be bad for me
if I got caught.

596
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:51,173
I never thought
it would be bad for her.

597
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:53,409
Nobody else was having
adverse reactions.

598
00:28:53,477 --> 00:28:55,911
You did it because you love her.

599
00:28:55,979 --> 00:29:00,116
Ironically, you never
took her into consideration.

600
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:03,419
Can't wait to see what you
get her for your anniversary.

601
00:29:06,022 --> 00:29:07,423
Catheter's adjacent
to the optic chiasm.

602
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:09,358
We're in position.

603
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:19,335
Nukey, nukey.

604
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,716
What's going on
with everyone today?

605
00:29:29,784 --> 00:29:32,018
It involves House,
Foreman, and Thirteen,

606
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:34,788
which means it's either
dumb, dangerous, or tragic,

607
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:36,156
or a combination.

608
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:37,591
I'm embracing my ignorance.

609
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:39,659
House was right about
the hemangioma.

610
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:40,727
Looks fixable.

611
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:44,864
What's that?

612
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:47,100
<i>Hemangiomas travel solo.</i>

613
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:48,501
<i>This thing</i>
<i>has brought a friend.</i>

614
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:51,171
Masses in her lungs and spine.

615
00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:52,639
<i>One in her pericardium.</i>

616
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,474
They're everywhere.

617
00:29:57,244 --> 00:29:59,913
Classic mesothelioma.

618
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,616
<i>It metastasized outward</i>
<i>to the spine and muscles.</i>

619
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:04,618
Ah, the irony of it.

620
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:06,186
Maybe she wouldn't be sick at all

621
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:07,954
if some other lazy cancer researcher

622
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:09,155
hadn't gone home early.

623
00:30:09,223 --> 00:30:10,690
Where are Foreman and Thirteen?

624
00:30:10,758 --> 00:30:13,493
Shouldn't you be saying,

625
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,696
"those weren't there when
we scanned her two days ago"?

626
00:30:16,764 --> 00:30:17,764
Mesothelioma
shouldn't grow this fast.

627
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:19,232
Good rephrasing.

628
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,335
Have Wilson do a biopsy
to confirm.

629
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,804
No.

630
00:30:24,872 --> 00:30:26,206
Something weird is going on.

631
00:30:26,273 --> 00:30:28,074
It involves our colleagues--
we should know.

632
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:29,109
You want us to treat
the patient,

633
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:30,276
tell us what's going on.

634
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:32,646
Actually, all he needs us to do

635
00:30:32,713 --> 00:30:34,447
is tell Wilson to do something.

636
00:30:34,515 --> 00:30:36,182
So...

637
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:40,854
You always blab
to watch people react.

638
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:43,023
So not blabbing means
you don't want us to react,

639
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,324
which can't be good.

640
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:47,060
Is Thirteen's headache
not just a headache?

641
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:49,262
If I check with admitting,
am I gonna find her name?

642
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,500
A little pinch.

643
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:02,909
I'm sorry about the other day.

644
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:04,611
I...unloaded on you.

645
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,946
And...
- You're not sorry.

646
00:31:07,014 --> 00:31:10,784
<i>You feel bad because</i>
<i>mesothelioma means I'm dying.</i>

647
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:13,787
You're a good person.
I appreciate the sentiment.

648
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:16,089
I'm not apologizing
because you're dying.

649
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:18,658
I'm apologizing
because you were right.

650
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:20,060
I am stuck.

651
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:24,230
My girlfriend died.

652
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:28,234
She was the only person I've
loved for a long time, and...

653
00:31:28,302 --> 00:31:29,736
I'm still living in her apartment.

654
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,505
I'm surrounded by her things.

655
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:34,941
I have left it all
exactly where it was.

656
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,380
I don't know how to get unstuck.

657
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:45,385
The only wrong thing is...
to do nothing.

658
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,559
Yeah.

659
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,063
All right.

660
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:06,172
That's not supposed to happen.

661
00:32:13,814 --> 00:32:15,749
Have you thought about
going to the drug company,

662
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:17,217
see if they can help?

663
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:18,918
I thought about it.

664
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:20,053
We need to give it more time.

665
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:21,387
It's been half a day.

666
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:22,922
This thing keeps growing,

667
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,090
there's other stuff in your brain

668
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:25,658
you might need later on.

669
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,260
If I were any other patient,

670
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:29,496
you'd both be in the lounge,
eating donuts.

671
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:31,097
You're not any other patient.

672
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:32,932
Right.

673
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,667
Any other patient,
you don't feel guilty.

674
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:37,036
<i>But you don't get</i>

675
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:39,405
to torch your career
to pay for your sins.

676
00:32:39,473 --> 00:32:42,475
House told her to say that,
didn't he?

677
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,078
Does that make it any less true?

678
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:47,113
You think he's right?

679
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:48,815
Who cares?

680
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,517
You're a hypocrite.

681
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:53,286
<i>You don't ask her</i>
<i>if she wants to be on the drug,</i>

682
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:55,088
but when there's a chance
you could help her get better,

683
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,589
suddenly you're letting her
call the shots?

684
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:58,925
<i>That's not being noble.</i>

685
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:02,162
That's saving your own ass.

686
00:33:02,229 --> 00:33:06,199
I'd feel worse
if he destroyed his career.

687
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:10,370
Mesothelioma doesn't bleed.

688
00:33:10,437 --> 00:33:12,772
So what causes masses
that do bleed?

689
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,874
Avm's secondary
to schistosomiasis.

690
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:16,609
She'd be crawling with worms.
We'd have noticed it.

691
00:33:16,677 --> 00:33:18,978
Gorham's disease and Kasabach-Merritt

692
00:33:19,046 --> 00:33:21,414
can both cause super-aggressive
vascular tumors.

693
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:29,556
So what causes that?

694
00:33:29,623 --> 00:33:31,691
Cardiac tamponade.

695
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,526
<i>She's bleeding</i>
<i>into her pericardium,</i>

696
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,828
Smothering her heart.

697
00:33:34,895 --> 00:33:36,262
Syringe.

698
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:41,267
B.P.'s going back up.

699
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:42,368
<i>It's working.</i>

700
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:43,503
No, it's not--
look.

701
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:54,285
We're transfusing platelets, FFP,

702
00:33:54,353 --> 00:33:55,653
everything to try
to keep her stable.

703
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:57,021
But we can barely
keep up with the blood loss.

704
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:58,923
At this rate, she could be dead
by the end of the day.

705
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:00,558
We need to resect
the vascular tumors,

706
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:01,926
stop the bleeding.

707
00:34:01,994 --> 00:34:05,063
Too late--no surgeon's
gonna touch her now.

708
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:07,699
Should we give up?
Just let her bleed out?

709
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:08,867
Don't be silly.

710
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:10,034
You know what that would do

711
00:34:10,102 --> 00:34:11,736
to our malpractice insurance rates?

712
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:13,705
We go on the offensive.

713
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:15,940
Cut off the invading army's
supply line.

714
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:18,076
You're talking about embolization?

715
00:34:18,144 --> 00:34:20,178
Cut off the arteries
that feed blood to the tumors,

716
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:21,946
they wither and die.

717
00:34:22,014 --> 00:34:23,615
Start with the ones in her lungs.

718
00:34:23,682 --> 00:34:24,849
If they get any bigger,

719
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:26,684
she's gonna have
a hard time breathing.

720
00:34:26,752 --> 00:34:28,319
So she'll have a hard time
telling us she's dead.

721
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:29,554
You can't kill the tumors

722
00:34:29,622 --> 00:34:31,222
without also killing healthy tissue.

723
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,725
If we wipe out 3/4 of her lungs...

724
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:34,793
Let's hope that running marathons

725
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,494
wasn't on her happy list.

726
00:34:45,337 --> 00:34:47,138
I found this.

727
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:49,741
Ahem.

728
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:51,743
In the, uh, coat closet.

729
00:34:51,811 --> 00:34:53,778
Where I hid it.

730
00:34:57,883 --> 00:34:59,517
Thought I'd never see you again.

731
00:34:59,585 --> 00:35:02,387
Little, little Greg.

732
00:35:02,454 --> 00:35:03,855
Yeah, you heard me right!

733
00:35:10,196 --> 00:35:12,664
Well, you are who you are.

734
00:35:12,731 --> 00:35:14,732
It's annoying, but...

735
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,701
it's not your fault.

736
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:18,469
It isn't about you.

737
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:20,872
I...

738
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,140
I'm sorry.

739
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,210
Because you were
doing this job perfectly

740
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:26,444
until the baby came along.

741
00:35:26,512 --> 00:35:29,113
What?

742
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:31,549
I'm apologizing.
Can't you just accept my--

743
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:33,484
I accept.

744
00:35:33,552 --> 00:35:36,120
We gonna have to do
this dance again in 28 days?

745
00:35:36,188 --> 00:35:37,956
What the hell is wrong with you?

746
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:39,591
Yesterday, you hate me.

747
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:41,860
Today, you're practically
weeping on my shoulder.

748
00:35:41,927 --> 00:35:43,895
I can only assume
that what I'm hearing

749
00:35:43,963 --> 00:35:46,998
is your Aunt Flow telling me...

750
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,908
When I was being a jerk,
you suddenly act human.

751
00:35:56,976 --> 00:35:59,811
But when I act human,
you turn back into a jerk.

752
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:02,146
Guess our cycles
aren't matched up yet.

753
00:36:02,214 --> 00:36:04,782
This is your way

754
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,718
of saying you accept
my apology, isn't it?

755
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:08,686
Nope, this is my way of saying

756
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:09,854
You were doing a crappy job before;

757
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:11,789
You will a slightly
crappier job now.

758
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:14,259
Everything keeps going.
Nature of life.

759
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:15,660
Nature of parenthood.

760
00:36:19,832 --> 00:36:21,499
Or this whole thing
is just an act.

761
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:24,469
And you've gone back to the part
you think you need to play.

762
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:28,273
You should go talk to Wilson.

763
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,542
Rationalization man
needs a faithful sidekick.

764
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,511
Now, rational man
needs to go save a life.

765
00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:44,455
House.

766
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:46,491
If you're looking
for returnable bottles,

767
00:36:46,558 --> 00:36:47,759
Kutner's already cleaned it out.

768
00:36:47,826 --> 00:36:49,694
Damn!

769
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:50,795
Oh, well.

770
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:51,863
That means the only thing

771
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:54,098
I'm gonna get out of this...

772
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:55,133
is a diagnosis.

773
00:36:56,669 --> 00:36:59,270
So the nurses gave her pads
instead of tampons.

774
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:00,905
Is that diagnostically relevant?

775
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:02,473
Fact that the nurses had
to give her anything is.

776
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,442
Means she's bleeding
from her uterus.

777
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,543
Women do that.

778
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:06,577
It's perfectly natural.

779
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:07,779
Not scary at all.

780
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:09,247
She menstruating

781
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:11,149
and she's bleeding everywhere.

782
00:37:11,216 --> 00:37:13,084
There's about a 3 or 4 in 28 chance

783
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:14,852
it's a coincidence.

784
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,220
Which leaves a much bigger chance

785
00:37:16,288 --> 00:37:18,957
that the diagnosis
is ectopic endometriosis.

786
00:37:19,024 --> 00:37:21,225
<i>She had a myoma</i>
<i>eight months ago.</i>

787
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:23,027
<i>Surgeons cut through</i>
<i>her uterine wall.</i>

788
00:37:23,095 --> 00:37:26,264
Every cut of the scalpel could
have sent endometrial cells

789
00:37:26,332 --> 00:37:28,232
spilling out into her bloodstream.

790
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,734
Some of them took up
residence in her lungs,

791
00:37:29,802 --> 00:37:31,602
some in her liver,
some in her spine.

792
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,805
And like all horny little cells,

793
00:37:33,872 --> 00:37:35,106
they went forth and multiplied

794
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:37,275
till they reached a critical mass.

795
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:38,910
In the days leading up
to her next period,

796
00:37:38,978 --> 00:37:40,778
when her uterus
is supposed to swell,

797
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:42,380
Everything swelled.

798
00:37:42,448 --> 00:37:44,315
And when her uterus
was supposed to bleed,

799
00:37:44,383 --> 00:37:46,718
everything bled.

800
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:49,520
Yes, ladies, I am blaming her period.

801
00:37:49,588 --> 00:37:51,422
Granted, it's the worst period ever.

802
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,258
Although, frankly,
not by all that much.

803
00:37:54,326 --> 00:37:55,727
Cut out the masses,
she'll be fine.

804
00:37:55,794 --> 00:37:56,794
<i>Can't do surgery</i>

805
00:37:56,862 --> 00:37:58,229
until her cycle's over

806
00:37:58,297 --> 00:37:59,564
<i>and she stops bleeding.</i>

807
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,132
Well, let's hope
she can hold out till then.

808
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,401
In the meantime, get her
a pint of cookie dough ice cream

809
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:04,369
and a DVD of <i>Beaches.</i>

810
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:32,330
I'm sorry.

811
00:38:37,102 --> 00:38:38,036
Foreman?

812
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:43,307
I can see you.

813
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:03,661
How you feeling?

814
00:39:03,729 --> 00:39:06,831
Relative to the last
few days, awesome.

815
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:10,768
You almost died.

816
00:39:10,836 --> 00:39:11,836
For the second time
in eight months.

817
00:39:11,904 --> 00:39:13,671
I know.

818
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:17,675
How do you feel about
your life choices this time?

819
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:20,178
I didn't lie there
thinking "what if?"

820
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:25,516
I always worry,
on my deathbed I'll think,

821
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:27,685
"I didn't do anything
really important."

822
00:39:27,753 --> 00:39:29,787
You're gonna spend
one day of your life

823
00:39:29,855 --> 00:39:30,955
on your death bed.

824
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:32,924
<i>The other 25,000</i>

825
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:34,358
<i>are the ones we should be</i>
<i>worrying about.</i>

826
00:39:34,426 --> 00:39:37,995
Go to bed happy tonight.

827
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:05,756
Dr. Schmidt.

828
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:09,427
It's Eric Foreman.

829
00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:14,132
Um...actually, the trial
isn't going too well.

830
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:26,811
You told them, didn't you?

831
00:40:31,316 --> 00:40:33,518
Well, you really had no choice...

832
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:35,953
On account of being an idiot.

833
00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:37,655
They gonna pull the drug?

834
00:40:39,124 --> 00:40:41,192
I broke protocol.

835
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,129
Her results are no longer
admissible to the trial.

836
00:40:45,197 --> 00:40:47,031
They don't have to do anything.

837
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:48,132
Anyone else gets a tumor,

838
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,333
they'll put a warning on the label.

839
00:40:49,401 --> 00:40:50,968
Gonna keep your license?

840
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:52,370
They'll come after me

841
00:40:52,437 --> 00:40:54,739
if I attempt to participate
in any more trials.

842
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:57,508
That's very decent of them.

843
00:40:59,378 --> 00:41:02,446
Well, good for me.

844
00:41:02,514 --> 00:41:04,749
I'll see you tomorrow.

845
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:07,485
And the next day.

846
00:41:07,553 --> 00:41:08,986
And the next day.

847
00:41:10,822 --> 00:41:12,323
That wasn't your locker,
was it?

848
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:15,960
It's a lock-ER room.

849
00:41:16,028 --> 00:41:17,528
How else are they gonna learn?

850
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,045
Do you think you can't
be happy without a kid?

851
00:41:36,215 --> 00:41:37,582
I don't know.

852
00:41:37,649 --> 00:41:40,351
# some kind of magic #

853
00:41:40,419 --> 00:41:43,054
I know I can't be happy
without you.

854
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:45,923
# happens late at night #

855
00:41:48,694 --> 00:41:54,098
# when the moon smiles down at me #

856
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:59,337
# and bathes me in its light #

857
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:05,509
# I fell asleep beneath you #

858
00:42:05,577 --> 00:42:08,613
# in the tall blades of grass #

859
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:13,818
# when I woke the world was new #

860
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:15,786
You snore.

861
00:42:15,854 --> 00:42:17,855
Shut up.

862
00:42:22,427 --> 00:42:25,830
# it's a brand new day #

863
00:42:25,897 --> 00:42:27,732
