what you're saying about the fortunato.

I'm sure.

That guy is a bit
of a blowhard, though, isn't he?

10
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:37,724
The food's not spicy at all.
You can barely taste it.

11
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,592
Mine's pretty spicy.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,761
Try it.

Uh, really...
he didn't.

I'm so sorry someone
would choose to behave that way.

Really, I...yeah.

00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,601
Patient had
his corpus callosum cut

Current issue
isn't the split brain.

You're dissing
the right hemisphere?

Most people who have
this operation

they're missing anything.

Left brain has language,
arithmetic, rationality.

Right brain is a mute loser.

00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:10,904
Right brain is more
aesthetically oriented,

71
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:12,338
has greater facial
recognition.

to judge people on aesthetics?

Right brain's also more
aware of the present moment,

Great. I love euphemisms.

85
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,403
By euphemism I mean
when you say something,

86
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,804
and it means something else.

00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:46,239

get hurt.

That's a fact.

You're also a valued doctor
in this hospital.

100
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:15,835
That's another fact.

101
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,738
From now on, we're gonna
focus on the second fact.

102
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:22,275
So this isn't you
freaking out over last night.

103
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:24,944
This isn't
an emotional decision.

104
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:26,746
I'm just giving you
the rules.

105
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:30,049

Okay.
Thought I'd mention it.

113
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:08,621
Wow.

114
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:11,524
Wow!
One for each.

115
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:14,394
That's what she said. Ha...
- How's the pain?

116
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:16,062
She's probably got
some bruising...

Yeah, I get it.
You're a stud.

she's gonna
give me the pleasure.

Ha.
- Yes.

132
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,796
Well, either she's actually
in love with you and scared,

133
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:53,566
or she realized last night
was a gigantic mistake...

134
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:56,069
you were needy and vulnerable,
she was maternal...

135

What does that say
about identity?

144

is very good today.

Go away.
- No other tables.

155
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:02,969
You'd let your wife
keep another man's offspring

156
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:06,305
on ice next to the frozen peas
just in case?

157
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:07,974
That's what this is about.

158
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,742
She's not ready
to commit to me.

159
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,577
She's planning for failure.

160
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:13,279
Did you know that male
fruit flies

161
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:15,882
have toxic chemicals
in their seminal fluid

162
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:18,050
that inhibit the sperm
of other males?

163
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:29,428
Wilson says we need to talk.

164
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:33,399
We talked.
- I agree.

165
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:36,802
This has clearly gotten past
the talking stage.

166
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:41,574
What?

167
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:45,178
Hey.

168
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:48,080
Great. Did you find my MP3?

169
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:49,448
Uh, not yet.

170
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:51,984
But I got your shaving stuff,

171
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:56,022
toothpaste, deodorant,
some magazines...

172
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,491
and this cactus
from your window.

173
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,992
You didn't have to do that,
really.

174
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,861
The hospital supplies
all that stuff.

175
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:03,462
I'm still trying
too hard, huh?

176
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,765
Trying to get
your other half to like me.

177
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:08,367
Don't say that, okay?
I like you.

178
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:11,103
Which means that--

179
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:17,210
we shouldn't read into that.
- Anti-fungal meds.

180
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:19,111
Ordinarily, we'd put them
in your IV,

181
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:21,981
but since your right brain
doesn't seem too fond of IVs...

182
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:23,749
You should be feeling
better in a few days.

183
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:25,051
I have to get back
to work.

184
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:27,787
Rick says your shift
will be waiting for you

185
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:30,089
when you get back.
- Thanks.

186
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:31,624
Oh! Oh, my God!

187
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:35,728
God! I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

188
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:37,697
I'm sorry.
- I have to--

189
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:40,066
I have to get back to work.
- Babe, wait, hold on!

190
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:43,569
No, it wasn't me!

191
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:46,038
I can't walk.

192
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:51,271
Well, obviously,
it wasn't the fungus.

193
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:52,572
And it's not
a coordination issues.

194
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,408
Dehydration can cause
loss of balance.

195
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:56,376
We haven't had him on IV.
- No, good skin turgor.

196
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:57,778
Not orthostatic.

197
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:00,614
Could be
our tax dollars at work.

198
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:03,650
Constantly building
new roadways and bridges.

199
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:06,219
A meningioma.
Slow growing.

200
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:08,488
Could extend along
the subosteal layer

201
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:10,524
of the cranial cavity
and be hidden by the bone.

202
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:12,859
The cancer cells are
actually re-growing a connection

203
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,294
between the left
and right hemispheres.

204
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:15,695
If you're right,
the two halves have begun

205
00:10:15,763 --> 00:10:18,065
sending messages again,
but it's too early

206
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:19,399
in the process for him
to pick up on it.

207
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:22,269
But...we can test for it.

208
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:28,241
Proof.

209
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,945
You didn't talk to her,
did you?

210
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:34,815
If I talked, she'd have lied,
I'd have lied.

211
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:37,084
And though two negatives
make a positive,

212
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:39,286
I thought thermal imaging photos
seemed simpler.

213
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:42,055
Note how many more
heated areas appear

214
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:43,557
after less than
a minute with me.

215
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:46,026
So it's either love
or possibly rage.

216
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:47,727
Don't talk to her.

217
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:49,796
I have no plans
to talk to her.

218
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:51,698
Manipulation
is in your genetic Code.

219
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,467
You think I'm making a mistake,
you move in to correct.

220
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:55,502
You are making a mistake.
- She lied to me.

221
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,937
Either last night or today.

222
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,772
I need to find out which
and why.

223
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,407
And clearly,
thermal imaging is the way.

224
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:01,741
This isn't a case.

225
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:03,176
You're not looking for
a diagnosis.

226
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:04,778
If this matters at all to you,

227
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:08,849
please, for once in your life,
be an adult.

228
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:13,687
Keep your eyes focused
on the plus sign.

229
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:15,789
Any image that appears
on your far right

230
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:17,090
will only be seen
by your left brain.

231
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:19,559
And any image on your far left

232
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,027
will only be seen
by your right brain.

233
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:22,329
Okay.

234
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:25,432
Just start by saying
the words.

235
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,766
Book.

236
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,535
Giraffe.

237
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:30,971
Willow.

238
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,005
Fortunate.

239
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:39,346
You're not saying the word.

240
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:43,083
I didn't see a word.

241
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,518
Could you draw a picture

242
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:45,852
of what you think
the word might be?

243
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,057
Uh, look, I-I didn't see...

244
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:57,063
Candle.

245
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:58,865
This is so cool.

246
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:00,567
Yeah, that's not freaky
at all.

247
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:02,602
No communication.

248
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,872
So far.

249
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:17,517
Scott, why are you
standing?

250
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:19,452
Uh...

251
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,188
I'm a little chilly.

252
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:23,323
I thought I'd get a sweater
or something from my room.

253
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:27,093
Is that okay?
- A few more minutes.

254
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,862
And that,
ladies and gentlemen,

255
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,697
is the left hemisphere...

256
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:33,667
the side that's obsessed
with finding answers,

257
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:36,303
the one that needs things
to make sense, the interpreter.

258
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,604
That's where we tell the story

259
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:38,972
of who we are
and why we do things.

260
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,874
That's also the side
that was wrong.

261
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:43,143
Right brain's advantage
is that it isn't logical,

262
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,312
doesn't choose which details
to look at,

263
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:47,214
makes connections
you could never see.

264
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:50,050
You owe your insight
to the "mute loser."

265
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:52,619
I'll send it tickets
to a Phillies game.

266
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,187
Confabulation
means no communication.

267
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:56,056
Means your theory's wrong.

268
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:02,329
But he is cold.

269
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:12,072
Why are you scratching?

270
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,708
It itches.
- Ammonia breath.

271
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:27,120
Your liver is failing.

272
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:28,722
I know for them
to approve this price,

273
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:30,824
they'll need statistical
documentation.

274
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:33,426
What?
Why are you looking at me?

275
00:13:33,494 --> 00:13:34,961
When you first walked in,

276
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,330
I was under the impression
you wanted to...

277
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:39,499
say something else.

278
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,467
Nope.

279
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:42,802
About House and me.

280
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,538
There's nothing
to talk about.

281
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:48,141
[door clicks open]

282
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:53,246
I want permission
to do a liver biopsy.

283
00:13:53,314 --> 00:13:55,181
We're looking for sarcoidosis.

284
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:57,951
Fine.
- What do you mean, fine?

285
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,286
What do you mean
what do I mean?

286
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:01,554
Do you mean because
a liver biopsy

287
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:03,857
is not a test that, by any
stretch of the imagination,

288
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:05,425
can be considered risky,

289
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:07,327
so asking my permission
is essentially wasting my time,

290
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:10,163
and you're wondering what
my reaction to that will be?

291
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:11,831
Yes.

292
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,667
Are you trying
to make me angry?

293
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,235
Yes.
- Do your biopsy.

294
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:16,703
And also do your clinic hours.

295
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:19,239
I'm blowing off
my clinic hours.

296
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:21,975
Really?
Let's see how that goes.

297
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:28,348
Still not angry.
Try again later.

298
00:14:40,523 --> 00:14:42,858
Ah...sorry.
I know I'm a little ripe.

299
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:45,094
Just a sweaty guy.
- Recently?

300
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:47,796
Always.

301
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:50,532
Uh, with a crazy left hand.

302
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,267
Sometimes I fantasize
about cutting it off.

303
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:53,836
Just a fantasy.

304
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:57,906
It's the hand that's crazy,
not me.

305
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:03,078
What? If it doesn't like
an ultrasound wand,

306
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:07,116
how's it gonna react
to a needle?

307
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:09,818
Can you get music
into this room?

308
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:11,954
I think you're using
your relationship with Cuddy

309
00:15:12,022 --> 00:15:14,023
as a replacement for drugs.

310
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,058
You should be in more pain
so soon into detoxing,

311
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:18,594
but your body's
full of romantic endorphins.

312
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:20,095
And on top of that,

313
00:15:20,163 --> 00:15:22,998
you create this distraction
of looking for proof.

314
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:25,401
Think I should stop
and let the pain flood back?

315
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:27,302
Cuddy is not
a Vicodin substitute.

316
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,737
Quite the opposite.

317
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:31,340
You have to wait
for her to be ready.

318
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:32,574
Great advice.

319
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:34,777
You pretend
that I'm gonna do that.

320
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:37,079
You've made two major
changes in your life.

321
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:39,148
Not a time anyone's
judgment is at its best.

322
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:40,716
Didn't you use to argue

323
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:42,885
that my judgment
would be better off drugs?

324
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:45,454
Admit it--you're curious
why I wanna make her angry.

325
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:47,623
I'm sure it's convoluted,
wrong, and stupid.

326
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,459
You're dying to know what
I found on her coffee cup.

327
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,629
No. Because--
- Oxytocin.

328
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,469
Oxytocin...

329
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:02,538
The chemical involved
in emotional bonding?

330
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:04,073
Her lips say no...

331
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,242
her hormones say,
"oh, my God, yes, more!"

332
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,812
No. For you to know
her levels were elevated

333
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,313
you'd need a base line
to compare them with.

334
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:12,948
I paid the guy in the gym

335
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:15,017
to retrieve one of her
water bottles from the trash.

336
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:18,153
Love inspires us
to greatness.

337
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:20,489
So I need to make her
lose her temper...

338
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:21,890
which breaks her delusion,

339
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,559
which demonstrates to me
and to her

340
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:25,761
that there is something
underneath this facade.

341
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:27,162
And then what happens?

342
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,330
She admits everything
and falls into your arms?

343
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:29,331
That's outcome one.

344
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,501
Outcome two...is she kills me.

345
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:35,771
I think it's 50/50 right now.

346
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,005
Great.

347
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:39,041
I thought you'd say that!

348
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:40,609
You're committing
yourself to something--

349
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:42,311
<i>Someone.</i>

350
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:45,247
I mean, it's childish
in a way,

351
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:47,149
but ultimately great.

352
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:48,784
Assuming...

353
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:52,321
are you absolutely sure
you want this to succeed?

354
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:56,358
Why is an old guy
standing in my doorway?

355
00:16:56,426 --> 00:16:58,227
Eugene Schwartz.

356
00:16:58,294 --> 00:16:59,895
Eugene Schwartz.

357
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:02,631
Dr. Cuddy asked me to come
up here from the clinic.

358
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,901
She says you're seeing patients
in your office.

359
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:08,203
It's still free, though,
isn't it?

360
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:10,839
She sent him.
That's gotta mean something.

361
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:14,042
I'll go get my decoder ring.

362
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,614
I squawk.

363
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,883
Like a parrot.

364
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,718
Aaww!

365
00:17:22,785 --> 00:17:25,587
No, that's not it.
It started a few months ago.

366
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:27,923
I was doing some woodworking
in my garage.

367
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:29,714
I was trying to make a chair.

368
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,583
Was it the chair?

369
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,785
Anyway, all of a sudden,
from nowhere,

370
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:37,222
this strange noise comes
bursting out of my mouth--

371
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,223
Caaaww!

372
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,259
Caaaww!

373
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,794
Tough to fake that.

374
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,164
Nice pants.

375
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,267
My wife Mona thinks
I'm bustin' her chops.

376
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,737
It's ruining my marriage.
Where are we going?

377
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,906
[Doobie Brother's
<i>China Grove plays]</i>

378
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,608
So your left hand
would rather play air guitar

379
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,343
than give me a hard time?

380
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,446
It'd rather play air guitar
than tie shoes, eat dinner...

381
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,682
Your right hand's
playing too.

382
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,418
I don't wanna
discourage it.

383
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:11,723
# #

384
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,659
Splinter hemorrhages
under his fingernails.

385
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,362
What's that?
What--

386
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,733
BP and 02 sats are dropping!

387
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,401
Need a bag of B-negative
in here!

388
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,503
So much for sarcoidosis.

389
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,739
Points to
a clotting issue.

390
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,774
Clots would explain
all his symptoms.

391
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,509
Why aren't we
in the office?

392
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,111
I'm tired of clinic duty.

393
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,348
There's only one thing that
could cause squawking, right?

394
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,918
Yeah. We gave him heparin
and did an echo of his heart

395
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,186
to see if it was
throwing clots, but--

396
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,455
More air guitar?
- The heart's fine.

397
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,457
We wanted to test
for factor V leiden,

398
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,725
Protein C, protein S,

399
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,727
but the hand got tired
of cooperating.

400
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,395
We finally knocked him out.

401
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,297
And all those tests
came up negative anyway,

402
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,732
or you would have opened
by telling me

403
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,200
your brilliant diagnosis.

404
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,068
He apologized
for being sweaty,

405
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,670
said it had always
been an issue,

406
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,205
but what if it's a symptom?

407
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,740
There are cancers
that cause night sweats

408
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,907
and can lead to clots--
Lymphoma...

409
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,910
Or pancreatic cancer.

410
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,314
Go scan his pancreas.

411
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,783
And...

412
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,285
try Led Zeppelin.

413
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,187
We've always remembered
what this hospital did for Leo

414
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,922
when his appendix burst.

415
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,724
Still, a check this size...

416
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,160
Sorry to interrupt.

417
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,896
Here's my poo.
[chuckles]

418
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,765
Dr. House said to bring it
over and leave it with you

419
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,299
as soon as I could.

420
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,669
I don't know if you people
have an official term for it--

421
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,171
Stool sample.
- Ah, yes.

422
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,639
Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

423
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,242
It's hard to rush
these things.

424
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,778
Even if you've eaten
a lot of broccoli.

425
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,717
Where you goin'?
- Annie called.

426
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,219
She's not coming back.

427
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,788
This is not the best time.

428
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,057
You said the heparin would
keep new clots from forming.

429
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,793
Maybe. But something's
obviously causing the clots.

430
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,994
If you have
pancreatic cancer--

431
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,529
We're not trying
to scare you,

432
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,497
but even in its early stages,
the fatality rate--

433
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,967
You walk out of here--
- Stop!

434
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,237
Look, I'd ask you to put
yourself in my place,

435
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,506
but nobody can put themselves
in my place.

436
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,575
Did she find somebody new?

437
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,143
Was I not being
attentive enough?

438
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,245
No.

439
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,549
She's just tired of being
insulted by a limb.

440
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:21,019
She said that my feelings
toward her were mixed.

441
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,355
Well, my feelings
aren't mixed.

442
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,291
You're not goin' anywhere

443
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,060
unless you wanna go naked.

444
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:32,597
Your right brain
knows you need to stay.

445
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:36,634
My right brain's an ass.

446
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,103
[sighs]

447
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,806
Got a minute?

448
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,542
There's something wrong
with this cup.

449
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,377
I need someone
to bounce ideas off of,

450
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,779
someone to be my whiteboard.

451
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,447
That's how
you taught me to work.

452
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,150
I have three choices:
First--I can accept it's over,

453
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,952
pretend we don't work
in the same hospital,

454
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,754
have selective visual impairment

455
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,455
when we pass each other
in the hall.

456
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,125
Second--I can accept
it's over and leave--

457
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,860
Or you could try
making him angry.

458
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,394
Standard choice number three.

459
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,164
Third...I can talk to him,

460
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:10,668
but it's not like I have
any new facts I can present.

461
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,070
And Chase has this
romantic view of love

462
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,405
that reality
can't compete with.

463
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,674
I know how you could succeed.
- How?

464
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,943
Just say the magic words--

465
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,781
"I will destroy
my husband's sperm."

466
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,349
Oh, you mean succeed
without doing that.

467
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,785
Probably not.

468
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,790
I have doubts.
Normal doubts.

469
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,825
It's not wrong to prepare
for bad things to happen

470
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,460
even if you don't
expect them to.

471
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,395
I don't expect my condo
to burn down,

472
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,231
but I have fire insurance.

473
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,267
Patient's girlfriend
left him.

474
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,270
Now he wants to leave us.

475
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,809
If your condo rules
don't let you buy insurance,

476
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,411
would you go homeless?

477
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,915
His room is this way.

478
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,683
What, do you think
I can fix this?

479
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,718
We need to offer this guy
something he can only get

480
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,021
if he stays in the hospital--
relationship counseling.

481
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,489
I don't know
if his girlfriend's--

482
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,990
I mean
his two hemispheres.

483
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,725
That's the breakfast
of relationships--

484
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,260
The most important one
of the day.

485
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,163
We need your special skills.

486
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:19,348
Is the guy out there?

487
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:21,650
The guy that's gonna
make my right brain work?

488
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:23,018
Oh, for...

489
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:25,988
[click] What do you think
your right brain wants?

490
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:27,389
How should I know?
It's crazy.

491
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:29,624
It does things
I would never do.

492
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:31,827
Duct of Wirsung's
slightly enlarged

493
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:34,062
but within normal parameters.

494
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:37,366
Say something.

495
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,668
It's mute.
It can't communicate with you.

496
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:42,938
Maybe you should try
communicating with it.

497
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:47,009
"Talk to her."
the well isn't deep, is it?

498
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:49,144
You're the dominant half.
You make all the decisions.

499
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:52,014
The right side
has no control over anything.

500
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:53,615
It must be...frustrating.

501
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:56,418
No masses in body
or tail segments.

502
00:22:56,486 --> 00:22:58,453
I can't communicate with it.
That's the whole--

503
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:00,722
When you decide to go and get
groceries, what do you do?

504
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,190
What do you mean?

505
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:04,059
I put on my jacket,
and I go to the store.

506
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:05,694
Your right brain
has no idea

507
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:08,130
why you're suddenly getting up
and putting on your jacket.

508
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:09,431
It just gets dragged along.

509
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:11,400
Next time,
try saying it out loud.

510
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:13,168
Just say to the empty air,

511
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:15,103
"Hey, I think
I'll go to the store

512
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:16,805
because we're out of
peanut butter"?

513
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:19,107
How much did they teach you
about people like me

514
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:20,609
when you were learning
to be a therapist?

515
00:23:20,676 --> 00:23:23,478
I'm an oncologist.

516
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,414
The right brain
likes what he's saying.

517
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:27,416
Hasn't moved
the entire scan.

518
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:29,217
Hasn't gotten us
anything, though.

519
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:32,487
Scan's clean.
It's not pancreatic cancer.

520
00:23:32,555 --> 00:23:35,557
Clotting could be a problem
well before a solid tumor forms.

521
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,225
It can still be pancreatic.

522
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,493
Yes, but if you want
a diagnosis

523
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:40,295
backed by actual evidence,

524
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:41,696
we should probably
look at other cancers.

525
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:42,998
House.

526
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:45,667
I just squawked!
- What?

527
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:47,102
Eugene Schwartz,
your patient from yesterday.

528
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,503
I just squawked!

529
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:50,372
I was buying some flowers
for Mona.

530
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,374
It happened
when I was paying the clerk!

531
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:54,743
I assume Dr. Cuddy
gave you this number.

532
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:57,446
Yes! She told me to call you
any time I squawked

533
00:23:57,513 --> 00:23:58,814
day or night!

534
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,082
I'm sorry,
but I'm about to lose you

535
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:01,583
because I'm about to drive
into a tunnel

536
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:04,686
in a canyon on an airplane
while hanging up the phone.

537
00:24:04,754 --> 00:24:06,888
I might be getting
some more phone calls,

538
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:08,490
so let's make it fast.

539
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,792
Lymphoma--
- That's right, pancreatic.

540
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,194
I know it's pancreatic.
I know there's evidence.

541
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:14,229
I know we've seen it.
I just can't--

542
00:24:14,297 --> 00:24:16,865
Right brain,
left brain issues?

543
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:19,334
If the cancer's
too small to find,

544
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:21,870
let's make it easier.
Let's open him up and paint it.

545
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:24,339
There's a new procedure
using scorpion toxin

546
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:25,740
and infrared paint.

547
00:24:25,808 --> 00:24:27,042
Paint only works
on the cancer cells,

548
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,510
makes 'em easier to spot.

549
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:30,545
Just agitating the pancreas
can cause clotting,

550
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:32,481
and you wanna do it to a guy
whose problem is clotting.

551
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:33,982
If I'm right about
pancreatic cancer,

552
00:24:34,117 --> 00:24:35,350
The only chance he's got

553
00:24:35,418 --> 00:24:38,253
is finding and removing
those cancer cells now.

554
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:40,355
His brain MRI showed
narrowing in the blood vessels

555
00:24:40,423 --> 00:24:41,823
leading up from the neck.

556
00:24:41,891 --> 00:24:43,758
If we do shake something loose,
we could kill him.

557
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:47,729
Clot in his brain
could kill one of them

558
00:24:47,797 --> 00:24:50,465
without affecting the other.

559
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:53,668
He might actually
be okay with that.

560
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:00,208
How long's it gonna take?

561
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:03,645
Assuming he doesn't crash...
A few minutes.

562
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,982
[click, beep]

563
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:16,258
Hey...you and Cameron.

564
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,660
I'm sorry.

565
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:24,499
I'll be right back.

566
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:32,407
I don't wanna be homeless.

567
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:34,643
Okay. You can stay
in the condo.

568
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,913
I'll find some other--
- That's not what I mean.

569
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,483
I wanna marry you.

570
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:44,753
I got the forms
to destroy the sperm.

571
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,488
You sure?

572
00:25:46,556 --> 00:25:48,456
Yeah.

573
00:25:48,524 --> 00:25:49,891
[laughs]

574
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:52,561
I wanna hug you,
but then I'd have to rescrub.

575
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:55,130
I know.

576
00:25:55,198 --> 00:25:57,032
BP's dropping.

577
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:59,334
Go.

578
00:25:59,402 --> 00:26:01,269
No sign of cancer.

579
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:03,471
BP's 90 over 60.

580
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:08,710
[footsteps approach]

581
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:13,949
You never answered
my question.

582
00:26:14,016 --> 00:26:15,650
Relax.

583
00:26:15,718 --> 00:26:17,419
Our friendship
is not doomed.

584
00:26:17,486 --> 00:26:18,787
Thank God.

585
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:21,923
But my question was
do you really want Cuddy,

586
00:26:21,991 --> 00:26:24,025
or is this just another
challenge?

587
00:26:24,093 --> 00:26:25,660
You're worried that once
I'm in a relationship

588
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:27,229
you and me'll be over.

589
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:28,663
Hey! I'm actually for this.

590
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:30,332
I think this is great.

591
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:32,934
But if you're serious and
you don't treat it seriously,

592
00:26:33,002 --> 00:26:35,604
then you will get hurt.

593
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:37,672
And if you don't accept that,

594
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,443
then accept
that she will get hurt.

595
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:01,263
She look angry?

596
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,232
If you're standing there
when she looks up here--

597
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:12,240
Oh, no.

598
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:13,675
Systolic's 80.

599
00:27:13,743 --> 00:27:14,843
Gotta finish this suture
before I can get out.

600
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,645
Give him a dopamine drip.

601
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:18,346
We weren't looking up
at the right time.

602
00:27:18,414 --> 00:27:20,048
Get to your point.
We're a little busy here.

603
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:23,418
The clots aren't from cancer.
They're coming from his heart.

604
00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:25,487
We echoed the heart.
No clots.

605
00:27:25,554 --> 00:27:27,289
Not while we were looking.
Didn't I open with that?

606
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:29,591
The clots were caused
by an arrhythmia.

607
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:32,527
No arrhythmia.
- Not while we were looking!

608
00:27:32,595 --> 00:27:34,095
Intermittent arrhythmia.

609
00:27:34,163 --> 00:27:37,065
This guy pulls our equipment off
at the slightest provocation.

610
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,000
We'd have to be watching
at the exact moment it happened,

611
00:27:39,068 --> 00:27:40,468
which I'm guessing,

612
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:42,871
given the way you two are
scrambling around like idiots,

613
00:27:42,938 --> 00:27:44,105
is right now!

614
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:46,675
Yes, I'm saying
do a transesophageal echo.

615
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:48,109
We have to get his BP stable.

616
00:27:48,177 --> 00:27:50,378
Absolutely.
Right after the echo.

617
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:52,013
[alarm beeping]

618
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:54,349
Systolic 70.

619
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,484
The heart looked healthy
at the last echo.

620
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:59,287
And an arrhythmia wouldn't cause
clots in a healthy ventricle.

621
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:01,489
So start with the left
atrial appendage.

622
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:04,592
[alarm beeping]

623
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,795
[beeping stops]

624
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:08,863
Wow.
- Yep.

625
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:10,598
I did it again.

626
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,967
Now get this poor guy's
BP under control

627
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,269
And seal off the appendage.

628
00:28:14,337 --> 00:28:16,204
Then all we have to do

629
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:18,239
is find out what damaged
his heart

630
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:21,276
before it goes after
something he really needs.

631
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:25,853
So what damages

632
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,570
a healthy 20-year-old heart

633
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,540
enough to make it send out clots
like it's bombing Dresden?

634
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:30,741
Rhabdo?

635
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,742
Would have fried
his kidneys too.

636
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,977
What about Graves?

637
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,179
Thyroid function tests
were normal.

638
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,847
Cushing's.

639
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,717
Cortisol overproduction could
interfere with heart rhythm.

640
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:43,087
Run a dexamethasone
suppression test.

641
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,467
Annie.

642
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,205
You hit me.

643
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:04,442
I know.
I'm so sorry, but...

644
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,876
It wasn't me.

645
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,411
I know you would never
have done that

646
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,913
if you were in control
of yourself, but...

647
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,115
But you came back.

648
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,017
To talk with your doctors.

649
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,487
I've been going over
and over what happened,

650
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,089
and I had this thought
out of nowhere.

651
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,724
Ever since I've known Scott,

652
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,759
I've seen his left hand
throw things

653
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,628
but always sort of playfully,
thinking it's fun.

654
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,665
But when he threw this...

655
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,467
it was angry,

656
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,902
and that's when
his hand slapped me, too,

657
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,838
when I brought it to him.

658
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,006
Could it mean something?

659
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,774
Deodorant shouldn't--

660
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,709
How often do you use it?

661
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,812
Uh, a few times a day.
It's special heavy duty stuff.

662
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,247
I have to send away for it.

663
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:46,017
Sprayed around a bathroom
the size of a shoebox.

664
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,219
I'll check the ingredients
from the manufacturer.

665
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,354
I'll check for any references
associated with health issues.

666
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,598
Somebody's grateful.

667
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,701
We'll just leave the...
three of you alone.

668
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,242
[door thuds]

669
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,714
Why is there
no lipstick on this cup?

670
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:20,151
Cuddy was wearing lipstick
when she drank from it.

671
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,086
It was on my face.
Why isn't it on the cup?

672
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,056
Why is it always reasonable
in Houseland

673
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,757
to take an emotional problem

674
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,227
and sidestep it by turning it
into a mechanical problem?

675
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,929
Because in Houseland--

676
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,397
and the rest of the universe,
by the way--

677
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,800
when a question presents itself,
it calls for an answer.

678
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:39,603
If the left brain
is the interpreter of reality

679
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,373
and the one that tells us
the story of who we are,

680
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,775
then what is your story?

681
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,878
Do you wanna be
the man with the answers,

682
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:51,215
or do you wanna be
the man with Cuddy?

683
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:03,194
What do I do?

684
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,296
You make her angry.

685
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,199
You really think that was
the best time to mock me?

686
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,535
I'm as surprised as you,
but I think I'm serious.

687
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,970
Communication can't start
unless you're--

688
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,339
I've been trying
to make her angry for--

689
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:16,440
No, you haven't.

690
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,209
Come on!

691
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,177
Poo, strippers?
It's routine stuff.

692
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,279
You've been pulling
your punches.

693
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,582
You're scared.
You should be.

694
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:33,124
Now...go terrorize her.

695
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,369
You don't wanna
destroy it, do you?

696
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:48,305
I said I was gonna do it.
I'll do it.

697
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,375
But you don't want to.

698
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,444
I wanna be with you.

699
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,246
Maybe I'm not
comfortable with it--

700
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,381
Let's say it's our fifth
anniversary.

701
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:00,217
Are you ready
to destroy it now?

702
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,920
Tenth.
Three kids.

703
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,822
They spend their summers
in Melbourne

704
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,357
And have annoying accents.

705
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,991
It's disgusting
how happy we are.

706
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:11,361
You ready now?

707
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,533
You don't have doubts.

708
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,469
You just don't wanna kill

709
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:23,306
the only thing left
of someone you loved.

710
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,949
Don't do it.

711
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,552
I do have trouble
giving things up.

712
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,623
For example...

713
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:43,326
I never cancelled
any of our wedding plans.

714
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:48,731
[laughing]

715
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:54,437
[bang bang]

716
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,573
[bang bang]

717
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:01,744
Attention!
I have an announcement.

718
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:03,179
As you go about your day,

719
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,248
I would like you
to be aware of the fact

720
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,950
that I slept with Lisa Cuddy!

721
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:11,154
[murmuring]

722
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,087
This is beyond ass-hood!

723
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:43,457
You have the luxury
of not caring about your image.

724
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:45,159
I do not!

725
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:47,061
I can permit a lot of crap,

726
00:33:47,129 --> 00:33:49,564
but an employee
shouting about

727
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:52,099
his sexual
exploits with me--no!

728
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:54,068
That is zero tolerance!

729
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:55,770
So congratulations, House.

730
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:57,538
I am angry.

731
00:33:57,606 --> 00:34:01,843
I was wondering
if we should move in together.

732
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:07,348
[laughing]

733
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:13,120
You're fired.

734
00:34:15,991 --> 00:34:17,692
I wouldn't worry about it.

735
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:19,393
I think she likes you.

736
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:21,395
If I'm fired,
I think that probably means

737
00:34:21,463 --> 00:34:23,130
I don't have to see patients.

738
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:26,934
I'm here as a squeaky wheel.
I know how you doctors are.

739
00:34:27,002 --> 00:34:28,636
You're busy,
you get distracted.

740
00:34:28,704 --> 00:34:31,239
My lab results could be
sitting in your in-box.

741
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:34,275
I don't need your labs.
You have acid reflux.

742
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:35,509
Well, how could you--

743
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:37,445
Acid splashes
on the vocal chords.

744
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:39,680
They tense,
make that squawking sound.

745
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:41,249
It's completely harmless.

746
00:34:41,316 --> 00:34:42,450
I'm gonna give you
a prescription,

747
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:43,951
and you are gonna go away.

748
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:46,087
You are a great doctor.

749
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:47,588
Ha.

750
00:34:47,656 --> 00:34:49,824
Why'd you move your belt?

751
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:51,425
I always move my belt.

752
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:53,461
Makes me sore.

753
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:55,463
You didn't tell me that.

754
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,665
At 86, what isn't sore?

755
00:34:57,733 --> 00:35:01,903
Soreness is less important
than squawking.

756
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,639
It's the squawking that was
bothering my wife. [grunts]

757
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:09,176
That's not a potbelly.
It's a tumor.

758
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,983
That's why pancreatic cancer
was on my mind.

759
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:18,486
My brain was trying
to tell me.

760
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:20,454
This isn't sounding good.

761
00:35:20,522 --> 00:35:23,257
Pancreatic cancer?

762
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:26,427
It can cause acid reflux.
We should scope you.

763
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:29,830
So it's not good.
Even for cancer it's not good.

764
00:35:29,898 --> 00:35:31,732
No, it's not.
[elevator bell dings]

765
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,502
The deodorant has a high
proportion of propylene glycol.

766
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:35,970
Same stuff made a kid
in Singapore

767
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:38,739
develop a heart condition,
and--get this--seizures.

768
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:42,109
Our patient may never have
needed split-brain surgery.

769
00:35:42,177 --> 00:35:44,779
I'm sure he will
half-appreciate the irony.

770
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:51,319
Take this man to radiology.
Pancreatic scan.

771
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:55,189
And stay with him.

772
00:35:55,257 --> 00:35:57,959

[brads clattering]

776
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:12,807
Whatever it is,
just say it quickly.

777
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:16,510
Do you have more than one
lipstick in the same shade?

778
00:36:16,578 --> 00:36:21,048
Maybe one that has a sealing
agent and one that doesn't?

779
00:36:21,116 --> 00:36:25,920
How could that possibly
be relevant to anything?

780
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:29,290
You really don't think
you're just...

781
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,093
overreacting
to the other night?

782
00:36:34,696 --> 00:36:37,398
Fine. I am overreacting.

783
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:40,701
You've said plenty of lousy
things to me before.

784
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:42,570
But...

785
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:45,840
reaching the final straw
has been a good thing

786
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:47,608
because it made me realize

787
00:36:47,676 --> 00:36:51,078
we not only don't have
a personal relationship,

788
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:53,647
we never could.

789
00:36:56,551 --> 00:37:00,721
You--you're--

790
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:05,559
you've been overreacting...

791
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:08,195
to something I said?

792
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:10,998
You insulted me.
I walked out.

793
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:15,503
It's nothing that hasn't
happened a hundred times before.

794
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:21,542
[exhales]

795
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,777
I quit.

796
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:26,113
Great.

797
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:29,750
My Nanny is off the clock
at 7:30,

798
00:37:29,818 --> 00:37:32,053
so...
you're a week off.

799
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,555
You can go suckle
the little bastard child

800
00:37:34,623 --> 00:37:38,259
if it makes you feel good
about yourself.

801
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:40,861
Screw you.

802
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:01,882
No, no, that--
that's not what happened.

803
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,784
I told you that I needed you.

804
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:06,887
You--you helped me.

805
00:38:06,955 --> 00:38:09,757
Are you okay?

806
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:36,050
Are you okay?

So...this is the story

810
00:40:26,695 --> 00:40:29,296
you made up about who you are.

811
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:33,033
It's a nice one.

812
00:40:34,536 --> 00:40:38,172
Too bad it isn't true.

813
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:48,515
No.

814
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:51,185
I'm not okay.
