1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,380
who picked this dump?

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,700
you suggested it.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,450
I suggestedyou look into it.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,020
Sorry.The
online reviews--

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,030
were obviously writtenby some geek
in their own marketingdepartment.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,690
Next time,call someone you know.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,480
Stop relying on a computer
to do your job for you.

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,270
Brightsize apparel-- eight sexual
harassment suitsin two years.

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,060
- Who asked for the meeting?
- They did.

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,660
patty michener, president
of women's majority.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,550
And wow-- do
you guys need me!

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,130
Nine men.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,020
No one thoughtit might be a good
idea to put a suit on one of the gals

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,530
from the steno pool to make
it look likeyou give a damn?

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,110
We've made it a priorityto
promote more women, but--

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,030
well, from now on you have me
standing beside you, which is good.

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,400
Because your problem
is a national problem.

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,860
with all due respect, miss michener,

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,160
I'd hardly call a few isolated
incidents a national problem.

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,180
six out of ten victims
never even report harassment.

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,830
This is bigger than just eight women.

22
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,440
That still only means 20.

23
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,270
Not enough for you?

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,140
How many asses does your
corporate policy allow you to grab?

25
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,880
Tell you what you're gonna do.

26
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,310
You're gonna settle with
anyoneyou haven't settled with.

27
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,650
You're gonna fire any
manwho's even been accused.

28
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,700
Somebody help me! Please
help me. I can't get 'em off!

29
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:28,120
Please help me! Help me, please!
Somebody help me! Get 'em off.

30
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,770
You gonna call an ambulance, or are
you just gonnasit there and stare?

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,880
Help me, please!

35
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,080
Wilson's
back.You gonna--

36
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,460
he's been gone two months.

37
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,300
He can wait till I finish slaying a
guy in a skullcap and a pair of tights.

38
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,580
On a video game you stole
from the pediatric ward?

39
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,720
On advice of counsel, I assert my
privilege pursuant to the fifth.

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,030
When was the last
time you talked to him?

41
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,040
Uh, I think it was after...

42
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,010
when did his girlfriend die?

43
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,690
He wanted time alone.

44
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,750
I considered being a
horrendous pain in the ass,

45
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,360
but I didn't want to tread on your turf.

46
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,940
We got a case.

47
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,100
I've gotta remember to close the blinds.

48
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,670
Just got a call from patty michener from
women's majority, the women's rights--

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,780
we know who she is.

50
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,470
I dated her.

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,970
Well, not really dated her.

52
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,330
More metaphorically raped
her by having a penis.

53
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,320
You did too.

54
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,750
Her assistant flipped out.

55
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,630
Ripped off her clothes in front
of a room full of businessmen.

56
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,680
Well, either she cracked under the
whip, or she started to realize that

57
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,890
her evolutionary purpose is to
arouse men, not to castrate them.

58
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,120
Send her to psychiatric.

59
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,350
Anemia, bradycardia, and abdominal
pain aren't psychiatric symptoms.

60
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,540
Then it's the latter.

61
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,440
Send her to my apartment.

62
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,320
I'll give it to segal.

63
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,520
House actually wants a
case, and you're saying no?

64
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,880
House has more important things to do.

65
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,480
Sorry, can't help you.

66
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,090
You need a specialist to
remove those kind of warts.

67
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,420
Preferably one with
experience spelunking.

68
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,860
Hallucinations, possible memory loss.

69
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,180
Tests show anemia, slow heart rate, and
a stubborn refusal to shave her pits.

70
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,590
Have you seen wilson?

71
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,370
Nope. But I have seen the
patient's frequent flyer balance.

72
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,140
Eastern europe, asia, third-world
countries. Sometimes more than one a day.

73
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,210
No fever means it's
not a tropical disease.

74
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,800
If it's not where she went,
maybe it's the work hours.

75
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,110
Could be amphetamine abuse.

76
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,240
She's probably popping
them like breath mints.

77
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,680
You haven't been by his office?

78
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,770
Is wilson hallucinating ants
crawling all over him too?

79
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,400
Tox screen's cleaner than
the windows she won't do.

80
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,450
Her job keeps her constantly on the road, probably
living off of airline peanuts and diet soda.

81
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,120
Severe b12 deficiency could
cause all her symptoms.

82
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,650
Why is everyone leaping to conclude a strong
career woman's been made sick by her strong career?

83
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,970
It's not b12, it's an
insulinoma in her pancreas.

84
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,340
It's making her hypoglycemic.

85
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,710
Great. Now everyone knows.

86
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,200
You knew the patient had cancer?

87
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,200
Is that what she said?

88
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,810
I thought she said, "I am suddenly and
irrationally defending "the patient's strong career,

89
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,630
"even though in reality
"she's just a glorified grunt?

90
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,950
"Because I'm trying to convince myself that it's
okay "not to have a life because I don't have a life.

91
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,050
"Because I was tested for huntington's,
and my life span's been cut in half."

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,870
Been waiting two months
for her to say that.

93
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,510
Hallucinations,
anemia, bradycardia--

94
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
hypersegmented polys
says that taub's right.

95
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,310
Pump her full of b12.

96
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,950
See how a strong career woman's
been made sick by her strong career.

97
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,020
Are you okay?

98
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,930
Could be yearsbefore
you see any symptoms.

99
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,290
Why wouldn't you tell us?

100
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,750
I don't have huntington'S.

101
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,250
Are you lying to us...

102
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,210
because it's noneof our business?

103
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,350
If it's noneof your business, then I
shouldn't haveto answer these questions.

104
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,610
And I wouldn't have to, except house
doesn't want toanswer questions about wilson.

105
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,690
He's deflectinghis own problems onto me.

106
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,920
Are you deflecting now?

107
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,890
Time for a b12
cocktailand my life lesson.

108
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,590
No, patty will dothe hearing.

109
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,150
She just needs to bethe
leadoff witness so--

110
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,990
okay, I'll lock it down today.

111
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,570
I need you back in bed.

112
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,890
My boss hasa big beijing trip.

113
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,070
I've been planning itfor months.

114
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,910
I was just tiredand
dehydrated and--

115
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,970
ye, whenever I losesome shut-eye, I pound
my legs, clawingat imaginary ant colonies.

116
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,650
You have a severeb12
deficiency. Get back in bed.

117
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,590
I'm sure your boss can
dowithout you for a few days.

118
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,460
It's not about her. It's about me.

119
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,730
I want to be there. I want to matter.

120
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,910
Yeah, I mean,without you, who knows how
much starch they'd put in her shirts?

121
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,060
I'm sorry, I'm sureyour
boss depends on you for--

122
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,130
I need to get up.

123
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,090
- No, you need to stayin bed.
- Please, where's a bed pan?

124
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,920
Oh, my god, I'm sorry.

125
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,570
I just-- I just had
a bowel movement.

126
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,730
It's okay, b12
deficiencycan cause sudden--

127
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,140
that's not a bowel movement.

128
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,040
My patient...

129
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,460
is still fightingin the feminist
trenches, but the war is over.

130
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,450
Yesterday's slutsare
today's empowered women.

131
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,730
Today's sluts are celebrities.If
that isn't progress--

132
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,010
I'm leaving.

133
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,220
What, are you gonna
takeanother two months?

134
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,090
Boy, you're really milking
thisbereavement thing, aren't you?

135
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,750
I mean, good for you.
Take all the time you need.

136
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,070
I'm resigning.

137
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,740
Maybe moving out of new
jersey. I don't know yet.

138
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,360
Okay. That's an understandablereaction.

139
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,480
It's not a reaction. It's a decision.

140
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,420
I'm writing cuddymy
resignation right now.

141
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,630
I'm just back for the weekto wrap up
my clinical andadministrative duties.

142
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,480
You of all people should know,this is
bereavement 101.You think thata change of venue--

143
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,570
well, that spares me
decadesof psychoanalysis.

144
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,260
I'm not sayingyou're not in pain.

145
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,010
You're sayingmy pain's a cliche.

146
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,120
- I'm saying that pain fades.
- Did yours?

147
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,820
Physical pain is different.

148
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,810
I'd rather have my legchopped off.

149
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,530
- You don't know that 'cause you
haven't felt-- - neither have you.

150
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,830
- Sorry--patient's gota
rectal bleed. - Busy.

151
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,450
- We need you to-- - actually,
as you can see,I'm not busy.

152
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,040
It's just a euphemismfor
"get the hell out of here."

153
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,100
This is your grieftalking.

154
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,280
And, yeah, it isa bit textbook.

155
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,210
So before you give awayall your
possessions to the salvation army--

156
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,400
my girlfriend's dead.

157
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,250
I'm glad you've readthat
book before. I haven'T.

158
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,420
I'm late to meetdr. Olan to brief
him on the casesI'm handing over.

159
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,040
Bye.

160
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,330
It doesn't bother youthat house wouldn't take
just two secondsto talk about the patient?

161
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,680
Wilson's dealingwith a lot.

162
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,130
And our patientmay be dying.

163
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,420
she was bleeding out her rear.
We're looking up her rear.

164
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,680
You think we neededhouse's
expertise to set us on this course?

165
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,660
Her heart rate's slow--bleedshould
have made it faster.

166
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,760
And it can wait till afterwe
know where it came from,

167
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,010
and after he's done
dealingwith personal issues.

168
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,480
Yeah? That the wayit works around here?

169
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,200
We get cut slack while
we dealwith personal sues?

170
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,880
You're not the boss.

171
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,880
Boss gets to makethe
rules.Boss gets to ignore--

172
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,560
she's bleeding from... nowhere.

173
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,100
- You did an endoscopy?
- And a colonoscopy.

174
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,080
- Ct scan?
- Ordered.

175
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,040
But it shouldn't show
anythingthe endoscopy didn'T.

176
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,800
We can't do a ct scan.

177
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,480
Why not?

178
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,730
We don't need a ct scan.
We don't need house.

179
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,090
Stop grinning and talk.

180
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,270
One of the routine
pre-proceduretests was positive.

181
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,120
Which one?

182
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,850
The one that,if it's positive,
would explaina hormone imbalance

183
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,340
that could screw with
heart rateand blood flow.

184
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,750
Guess she does have a
lifebeyond her career.

185
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,520
I'm pregnant?

186
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,240
You want me to call the
fatherand let him know?

187
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,980
Soon as you dosome dna
testing, let me know.

188
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,680
Must be hard to havea
real relationship when--

189
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,040
are you making excusesfor me?

190
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,350
I'm just sayingit's understandable.

191
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,650
You only haveto understand
something if it needs an explanation.

192
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,000
I have needs. I met my
needs. End of explanation.

193
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,520
How recently were you... needy?

194
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,840
Oh, it's been two or
three months, at least.

195
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,300
What? What is it?

196
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,560
Nothing.

197
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,360
Tell me.

198
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,120
It's actually nothing.

199
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,170
The ultrasound shows no
traceof a baby at all.

200
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,310
Positive pregnancy test, no pregnancy.

201
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,380
B12 deficit rectified, buther
heart's slowing even more.

202
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,360
And a bleed should speedher heart rate.

203
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,180
House, this isthe kind of case you love.

204
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,540
Contradictions piling upleft and right.

205
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:16,080
Two false positivepregnancy tests,
bradycardia,lower G.I.Bleed. Go.

206
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,680
Choriocarcinoma--would'vetriggered
pregnancy hormones.

207
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,350
Also would have shownon a sonogram.

208
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,660
immunoglobulin "a" deficiency.

209
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,840
No urinary bleed.

210
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,080
If she's hadbeta hcg injections,
they can cross-react with...

211
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,130
keep going.

212
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,410
You're being an idiot.

213
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,040
You're gonna blow up your career.

214
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,340
And six months from now,when you've
moved on from amber to burnt sienna,

215
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,590
you're gonna be stuckin a mobile
oncology truck in pewaukee, wisconsin.

216
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,790
I'd need a flow chartto explain all the ways
in which that wasridiculously insensitive.

217
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,280
You can't hidefrom misery.

218
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,110
This isn't your business.

219
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,560
My skull was cracked
opentrying to save her!

220
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,400
Then we all needa
little tea and sympathy.

221
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,220
I'm throughdiscussing it.

222
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,110
Uh, we have a patient.

223
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,860
Who's obviouslynot going
anywhere with a bloody rectum.

224
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,140
Great to have you back.

225
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,790
Actually,
I'm--

226
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,470
actually, he'sabout to thrust a
tanto into the bellyof his career.

227
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,250
I'm leaving the hospital.

228
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,870
- I'm sorry, this is obviouslya
terrible time-- - why are you leaving?

229
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
I just need a changeof scenery.

230
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,050
Buy a plant.

231
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,600
Rectal bleeding,two
positive pregnancy tests.

232
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,630
There's nothing we can do?

233
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,250
You could ask houseto be a
grown-up and respect my decision.

234
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,140
I respect thingsthat deserve respect.

235
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,650
This decision,on the other
hand, is a dog wearing a cape!

236
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,160
Hallucinations.Heart
won't respond--

237
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,920
the patient tested positivefor pregnancy
because the patient is pregnant.

238
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,760
Hey, who are you?

239
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,900
This is dr. House. He's too
brilliantfor introductions.

240
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,060
False positive.

241
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,830
You're too busyto be running a
day care center in your abdomen.

242
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,400
False positive.

243
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,780
Not to mention you should waittill at least 30 to punish
that pleasure portalwith a 7-pound tissue expander.

244
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,660
I'm 37. And I thought I wasn't pregnant.

245
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,210
37?

246
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,860
Impressive.

247
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,150
Too bad you'renot
passing on those genes.

248
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,770
Does that look falseto you?

249
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,520
You were lookingin the wrong room.

250
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,910
It's more common when
the egglands in the oven.

251
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,800
Sometimes it winds upin
the fallopian tubes.

252
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,950
In rare cases, it plummetsthrough
the plumbing entirely.

253
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,050
It's using her
intestineas a blood supply.

254
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,020
It caused the rectal bleed, and now...

255
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,760
junior miss steinem'sjunior must
be pressing on her vagus nerve,

256
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,870
slowing her heart to a crawl.

257
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,140
Yank the fetus.

258
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,800
She survives the
surgery, she'll be fine.

259
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,650
What if she wantsto keep the baby?

260
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,870
She doesn'T.

261
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,870
Well, we can't taketwo
seconds to discuss this?

262
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,130
I mean, fetuseshave been transplanted
before. Whole uteruses too.

263
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:10,400
Just terminating the fetus when it's
gluedto her intestines is high-risk surgery.

264
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,440
Saving it is a fantasy.

265
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,770
That was at leastthree seconds.

266
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,380
She's a 37-year-old
woman who deserves--

267
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,000
people getwhat they get.

268
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,260
It has nothing to
dowith what they deserve.

269
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,140
And this has nothing to dowith her genitalia,
and everything to dowith your genetics.

270
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,720
You told meto get tested.

271
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,760
I didn't knowit was gonna color your every
medical opinion,every personal opinion.

272
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,340
You didn't thinka
death sentence would--

273
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,580
people die!You, amber, everyone.

274
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,790
Don't act like youjust figured that out.

275
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,960
I gave you a diagnosis. You don't
like it, there are exitson every floor.

276
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,840
I'm sorry to beso definitive about this.

277
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,610
I know you're still absorbingthe
news, but we have no choice.

278
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,470
Remove the fetus. Absolutely.

279
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,230
I have no boyfriend,no husband.

280
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,230
I'm on the road with pattyall the time.

281
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,900
Where do I sign?

282
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,430
You feel any tendernessback here?

283
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,770
No, not at all.

284
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,210
Treating professionalsports
injuries now?

285
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,300
No, I'm
not--

286
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,270
familiar with the conceptof sarcasm.

287
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,930
Don't sweat it,it's new.

288
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,330
Have you spoken to wilson?

289
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,070
We'll get you an ekg.
I'll be right back.

290
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,210
You want me to sleep with
himto get him to stay?

291
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,520
I put the bisexual chickon that.

292
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,780
If you'd like to sit in,so to speak...

293
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,730
- I spoke to him.
- What'd you tell him?

294
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,180
I didn't tell himanything. I listened.

295
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,360
So you could feel goodabout
doing nothing.You gotta tell him--

296
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,440
I am notyour errand girl.Best
thingabout leaving you--

297
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,610
the two of youused to be together?

298
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,230
She dumped me when I
lostthe last 85 pounds.

299
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,930
Said there was less of meto love.

300
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,510
Grief means different
thingsto different people.

301
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,120
Case in point,means very little to you.

302
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,520
Grief is newark. Okay, it's
there. You can't avoid it.

303
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,720
The idea isto hold your nose,
hope the traffic'snot too bad,

304
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,060
and get on to manhattanas quickly
as possible, not to buy property.

305
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,820
You think that'sfacing up to things?

306
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,940
I'm not the onewho's quitting.

307
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,450
'Cause youhaven't lost anything.

308
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,280
But you have. Listen to you.

309
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,480
What did you dowhen your husband died?

310
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,850
I got a new joband I moved.

311
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,880
See how crappythat worked out?

312
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:44,180
Separating the placenta from
the wall of the large intestine.

313
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,670
Sponge. Suction. We've
got some bleeding.

314
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,580
Bp's dropping. 90 systolic.

315
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,570
She's bleeding like hell. Clamp.

316
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,020
Bp's still dropping.

317
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,800
Amp of calciumhloride, fast!

318
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,140
- still dropping.
- Shut up!

319
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,460
Squeeze her spleen.

320
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,230
We need to forcesome platelets
out so her blood clots.

321
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,990
She's in weak shape. Spleen's
friable. It could rupture.

322
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,320
She's stabilizing. Oozing's drying up.

323
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,710
I hate visitors day.

324
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,820
Removing the fetus.

325
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,270
Bye.

326
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,640
You have to stop wilsonfrom
committing career malpractice.

327
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,150
Talk to him.

328
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,450
I already talkedto him
twice. He threw me out.

329
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,990
Mocking himand insulting him-- let's see,
yes,technically those are categoriesof conversation.

330
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,990
Block his referencesto other hospitals.

331
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,960
Tell him he can'thand
off his cases until--

332
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,670
talk to him.Deal with his grief.

333
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,130
Talk to himabout what
he's going through.

334
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,940
That's a brilliant idea.
I'll take him outfor a beer.

335
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,510
That'll make up for the
factthat amber's in a pine box.

336
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,020
That there's randomnessand
chaos in the universe.

337
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,800
Tell him you're sorry.

338
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,440
I didn't kill her.

339
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,730
You were
drunk and--

340
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,720
yeah, if her daddyhadn't been drunk,
she might neverhave been born.So--

341
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,750
you called her upin
the middle of the night.

342
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,960
She was on the busbecause of you.

343
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,870
I didn't ask herto come out.

344
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,920
I wasn't driving the bus.

345
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,490
I wasn't drivingthe garbage
truck that hit the bus.

346
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,140
And I did not prescribe herthe
flu meds that killed her.

347
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,570
Yes, I know,that's all true. But...

348
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,860
you really don't feelany sense of guilt?

349
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,150
You want to keep him, he
needs to knowhe's not alone.

350
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,430
Just tell him you feellike crap.

351
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,800
It'd be meaningless.

352
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,830
Well, then,find some meaning.

353
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,350
And do something.

354
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,550
She's gota neurological problem.

355
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,550
Surgical complication?

356
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,270
Don't think so. She keeps on blinking.

357
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,740
Her heart's not recovering either.

358
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,420
So the pregnancywas a coincidence.

359
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,590
Pulse is down to 39. She's
maxed out on atropine.

360
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,310
We're installinga pacing wire to...

361
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,090
Avoid that. We need some help in here!

362
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,400
- Page house.
- Already paged him.

363
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,010
Page him again.

364
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,420
It's for you.

365
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,260
If I told youthat I was sorry,
would it change anything?

366
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,020
I wouldn't believe you.

367
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,000
If you believe me.

368
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,540
It's hard to imaginesuch a world.

369
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,060
I'm going home...

370
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,070
until you agree to stayat this hospital.

371
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,400
You can't
be--that's blackmail.

372
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,870
And to do your job?

373
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,780
Why not hold a gunto your own head?

374
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,360
Your conscience bleedsmore
freely than my head.

375
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,550
Text.

376
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,770
Patient's in cardiac arrest. Ouchy.

377
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,100
- You'd jeopardizea patient because
of my-- - if it keeps you here.

378
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,540
Your friendship mattersmore
to me than this patient.

379
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,450
I've gotta do what's rightfor me.

380
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,990
You've gotta do what's rightfor you.

381
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,950
Yeah. But it comes easier for me.

382
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,390
where is he? Where is he?

383
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,920
status.

384
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,070
Her heart's stabilized.

385
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,280
We have a pacing wirein her, but the
bradycardiais not getting any better.

386
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,330
House is bluffing.

387
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,080
I called him three times. He's not
picking up. What do you want us to do?

388
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,650
The same thing you'd doif he was here.

389
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,630
If he was here, we'd
beasking him what to do.

390
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,660
- What are the usual suspects?
- There aren't any.

391
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,270
She had a vitamin deficiency,and we corrected
it, an ectopic pregnancy,we removed it.

392
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,460
But her heart problemwon't go away,
and now something's wrongwith her brain.

393
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,600
I have complete confidencein you guys.

394
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,970
Who wants to goservice house
so this patient can live?

395
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,510
We can do thiswithout him.

396
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,920
Maybe something happened
during the surgery.

397
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,960
The surgery was on her
bowel,not her brain.

398
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,490
Anxiety, stroke, tourette's
could all cause eye blinking.

399
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,570
And cause her heart to
beatfaster--it's slowing down.

400
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,920
M.S.If a lesion took outthe
sympathetic innervation of her heart,

401
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,760
it'd explain the
bradycardia and the blinking.

402
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,680
But not the vitamin deficiency
or the ectopic pregnancy.

403
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,310
House would want a unifying theory.

404
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,400
House is gone,and so are those sptoms.

405
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,400
M.S.Explains everythingthat's
wrong with her right now.

406
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,410
Start her on interferonfor M.S.

407
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,160
Mind if I come in?

408
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,800
Not at all. You mind if I leave?

409
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,830
I told you not to take that casespecifically
so you could dealwith wilson.

410
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,940
And the two ended updovetailing
rather nicely, don't you think?

411
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,650
Is this how you showyour friendship...

412
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,110
by bludgeoning himwith guilt?

413
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,920
Because he's my friend,I
know what works on him.

414
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,830
Well, I can't let youwalk
away from a patient.

415
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,920
Then fire me.

416
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,370
You're willing to riskyour career, but
you're not willingto say you're sorry.

417
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,060
I told him I'm sorry.

418
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:08,890
He didn't believe it.

419
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,580
- Well, make him believe it.
- I don't believe it.

420
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,300
You don't want to believe it.

421
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,070
Because if you tell wilsonhow
you actually feel about him,

422
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,530
about what happenedto amber,
about your partin what happened,

423
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,740
and he walksout
the door anyway--

424
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:26,270
if you make yourselfvulnerable for once in
your nerve-deadening,emotionally obliterating--

425
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,880
you're doing the same thing he is.

426
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,340
You're running away.

427
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,490
Only he's not killing
anyone in the process.

428
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,430
Where's dr. House?

429
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,790
He's not feeling well.

430
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,640
Was M.S.His idea?

431
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,170
We work as a team.

432
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,220
You know how it is. Collaborative.

433
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,190
Sometimes it's hard to
tellwhere an idea comes from.

434
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,510
But you're notreally a team.

435
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,130
You work for him.

436
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,760
And you work for patty.I'm sure
a lot of her ideas are actually--

437
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,060
She would be finewithout me.

438
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,120
I'd be nothingwithout her.

439
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,540
Maybe if you just hadthe chance.

440
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,750
I'm--I'm sureyou've
learned a lot.

441
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,110
Not everybody'screated equal.

442
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,610
Does dr. House thinkI have M.S.?

443
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,730
Yes.

444
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,380
Did you just shiver?

445
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,380
You're running a slight fever.

446
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,600
Is that bad?

447
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,690
It means we were wrongabout the M.S.

448
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,750
You had my cabledionnected!

449
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,080
Well,that's quite a leap.

450
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,580
Just becauseI happen to have a
31-person maintenance department--

451
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,880
each of whomyou've personally
abused at some point--

452
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,050
why? Did you think I'm
okaywith letting someone die,

453
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,570
but I'm gonna fold ifI can't
watch celebrity bowling?

454
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,540
That is notan unreasonable theory.

455
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,030
Especiallywith only ten
minutes till your favorite soap.

456
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,480
Oh, gee, is this the
remotefrom the doctors' lounge?

457
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,920
this is your 911? Good-bye.

458
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,870
Stop!

459
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,240
I'm withholdingyour salary history from
every hospitalin the tri-state area.

460
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,660
You go, girl.

461
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:22,580
And I'm permanently settingevery tv in this building
to the pottery channel unless you both sit down.

462
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,520
Welcome to couplescounseling.

463
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,910
it's not the surgery.

464
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,740
The timing fits.

465
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,780
The location doesn't, unlessher
brains are in her bowels.

466
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,880
If bacteria enteredher bloodstream, it
could have causedan infection in her brain.

467
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,980
the surgery went fine.
You were there, you saw.

468
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,930
Peptostreptococcuscould
explain the blinking and--

469
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,250
no.You want to watcha grainy
video and have an epiphany.

470
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,360
Shut up.

471
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,100
You're making me misshouse's mocking.

472
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,860
I know you told usit
was none of our business,

473
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,700
but if house thinks that your huntington's
is affecting you, maybe it really--

474
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,680
it's not, becauseI
don't have--

475
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,690
you're desperate to do thiswithout him.

476
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,890
You're not trying to cure her.

477
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,480
- You're trying to
pve-- - stop the tape.

478
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,310
Zoom in.

479
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,210
On the anastomosis,that little bump.

480
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,930
It's a hematoma.

481
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,260
A harmless pocket of blood, which is
why chase ignored itduring the surgery.

482
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,850
Could be a ganglioma, which is
why chaseshouldn't have ignored it.

483
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,000
It's an abnormal growth of nerves, it
could be causingall the patient's symptoms.

484
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,800
We have to open her up
again. Get a piece of it.

485
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,140
So what do you wantto tell us?

486
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,030
Nothing. Nothing I sayis
gonna change anything.

487
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,720
You guys need to talk.

488
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,160
Actually, you should just
readthe psych literature.

489
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,110
Repression's gaining a lot of fans.

490
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,830
What you don't facecan't crush you.

491
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,760
Talk to each other.

492
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,780
How you doing? Good?

493
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,260
Fine, thanks.

494
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,310
Sit!

495
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,240
See, the two of you are friends.

496
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,370
- Look how you both--
- think you're an idiot.

497
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,560
We both also eatwith forks.

498
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,380
- That doesn't really
prove-- - talk to him!

499
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,950
Tell him how you
feelabout what he's doing.

500
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,200
I told him he's an idiot.

501
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,670
Tell him what you
thinkabout him leaving.

502
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,460
- I think he's an idiot.
- You're an idiot. He's in pain.

503
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,810
And your response is justto
emotionally blackmail him.

504
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,730
You told me what your
positionis on that one.

505
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,910
You're against it, right?

506
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,640
She hasn't told youin front of me.

507
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,520
She needs to proveshe's on my side.

508
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,960
Go to hell.

509
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,470
So much for that theory.

510
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,230
I'm sorry you lost amber.

511
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,380
I cannot imagine what it
is you're going through.

512
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,640
But it will not get betterby you walking
away from everyone that cares about you.

513
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,560
Do you think amberwould
want you to walk away?

514
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,460
Nobody at this hospitaleven liked amber.

515
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,770
Same time next week?

516
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,460
You want me to doa second major surgery on a
patient we almost lostduring a first major surgery

517
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,260
to see if she needsa
third major surgery?

518
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,820
We need a pieceof the ganglioma.

519
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,110
Then you're talkingabout
another patient.

520
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,780
Yours doesn't havea ganglioma.

521
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,760
And if there is oneand you missed it?

522
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,930
Then you're talkingabout
another surgeon.

523
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,970
I didn't miss anything.

524
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,680
But we're not talkingabout
another videotape.

525
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,820
This one showed a
bump. We need to biopsy.

526
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,920
A bump? Oh, yeah. My
grandfather diedof a bump.

527
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,960
She can't survive a second roundof
general anesthesia, let alone a third.

528
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,370
- You'd do this for house.
- Yeah.

529
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,530
Then what do you suggest?

530
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,010
Because the patient's got a
high fever, a low heart rate,

531
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,180
and a dim chance of survivalif
we stand here like idiots.

532
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,900
Then I suggest you
don'tstand there like idiots.

533
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,640
How do you get coalout of a mountain
when it's someone else'smountain?

534
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,280
If we don't have house,it doesn't
mean we can't think like house.

535
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,730
But it does mean we don't
haveto talk like him.

536
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,170
You don't dig down.
You go in from the side.

537
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,590
We insert a lighted scopethrough the rectum,
move the intestine tillwe find the ganglioma,

538
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,860
then push it to the surface.

539
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,560
Where we see the light,we cut.

540
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,930
We'll make as small
an incisionas we can.

541
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,700
But unfortunately,it'll be very painful.

542
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,290
After your surgery experience,we
can't give you anesthesia.

543
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,920
Can I talk to dr. House?

544
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,470
No. We can do this. We
know what we're doing.

545
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,780
I don't mean to beinsulting, but my former boss
didn't insiston me coming here because of you or--

546
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,380
your former boss?

547
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,970
I've been replaced.

548
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,390
- I'm sorry.You
must be-- - I'm fine.

549
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,210
She has a big beijing
trip. Ton of work to do.

550
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,810
She can't just wait for meto get better.

551
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,470
We've been well-trained.

552
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,720
We'll take good care of you.

553
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,230
How can you let her
treat youlike a footstool?

554
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,850
The world needs flunkies.

555
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,140
Don't say that. You're better than that.

556
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,350
I have no problem with it. Why do you?

557
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,000
Because... life is short.

558
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,240
I mean, yours could've
endedin that surgery.

559
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,070
You'd have never livedfor yourself.

560
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,840
What kind of feminist--we
can have anything.

561
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,800
No, we can'T. We can aspire to anything.

562
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,520
But we don't get itjust
because we want it.

563
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:24,550
I would ratherspend my life close to the
birds than waste itwishing I had wings.

564
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,930
you're through the sigmoid,
into the descending colon.

565
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,610
Switching on the light.

566
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,150
Advance towardthe anastomosis.

567
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,670
That's it.

568
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,910
Push the wall of the
intestine toward the skin.

569
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,440
There, I see it.

570
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,900
Don't look down.

571
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,710
Scalpel.

572
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,100
So your last dayis friday.

573
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,570
I'm gonna miss you.

574
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,470
You shouldn't go.

575
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,060
Did house ask youto talk to me, or are you trying
to savethe patient?Because there'll always be--

576
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,270
- house asked me.
- And you're doing it.

577
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,180
I told him to go to hell.

578
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,080
Thanks.

579
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,660
But I think he's right.

580
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,750
You think you're
makinga rational choice.

581
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,690
You think the worstis over. And then...

582
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:50,630
six months lateryou look back and you
realize you didn't knowwhat you were doing.

583
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,710
Are you saying the paindoesn't go away?

584
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,440
It gets easier. Not in two
months. Not in two years.

585
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,510
But no, it never reallygoes away.

586
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,780
Being here--this building--
I was just in the lounge.

587
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,160
I kept staringat amber's locker.

588
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,320
I saw a guy wearing a scarfthis morning.

589
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,210
The color reminded meof his eyes.

590
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,630
We lived 500 milesfrom here.

591
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,650
I have to do something.

592
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,130
Then do it.

593
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,970
But don't thinkit's the
right choice, because...

594
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,780
there isn't one.

595
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,400
it's not a ganglioma.

596
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,010
The problemwasn't the surgery.

597
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,600
Abnormally depositedproteins.

598
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,690
It's amyloidosis. That would explain
the blinkingand the low heart rate.

599
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,360
Only way to treatamyloidosis is
to treatwhatever's causing it.

600
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,870
It's not as if a lot
of thingscause amyloid.

601
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,130
Rheumatoid arthritis.

602
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,770
Familial mediterranean fever.

603
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,650
Lymphoma.

604
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,040
Well, we can't allbe right.

605
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,880
But you can allbe wrong.

606
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,000
The patient's joints don't hurt,

607
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,140
abdominal pain went awaywhen the
fetus did, and no palpable lymph nodes.

608
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,890
Got anything constructiveto say?

609
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,370
Sorry. Sorry.

610
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,240
Um, she has lots and lotsof palpable
lymph nodes, joint and abdominal pain.

611
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,760
She'll be better by dinnertime.

612
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,750
If we don't find the
causeof the amyloidosis,

613
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,960
we never get her offthat wire, she
never walks outof this hospital.

614
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,540
But hey,who needs house, hmm?

615
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,650
So glad we lostthose training wheels.

616
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,840
You want me to makethe call?

617
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,880
There seems to besome disagreement.

618
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,100
And this isn't justa pretext
to pressure meinto staying?

619
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,500
Does it look likea pretext?

620
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,360
No.

621
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,630
She really is dying,isn't she?

622
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:37,610
Inflammation,enlarged
nuclei, some mitotic activity.

623
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,770
It could be lymphoma.

624
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,270
There areno palpable lymph nodes.

625
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,770
It makes it less likely,
but it doesn'trule it out.

626
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,630
I'm an oncologist. I see cancer.

627
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,950
Show it to an immunologist,
they'll see autoimmune.

628
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,660
I already showed itto an immunologist.

629
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,740
We'll start her on chemo.

630
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,210
You should leave.

631
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,440
House doesn't want to losehis sidekick.

632
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,800
Cuddy doesn't want to
loseher check on house.

633
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,610
No one's talkingabout what you want.

634
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,420
It's not that I want to.

635
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,090
Want to, need to.

636
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:16,160
If there's any chancethat being away from here
will make your lifeeven a little bit easier, do it.

637
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,920
That's what everyone else herewould do.

638
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,690
Don't expect anythingto change too fast.

639
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,440
Lymphoma was your idea?

640
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,740
Why?

641
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,880
I feel better.

642
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,140
Sometimes just knowingyou're
being treated helps.

643
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,920
You've given me18 different treatments.

644
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,960
This is the first onethat
made me feel better.

645
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:57,020
I don't thinkit's psychological.

646
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,240
Thank you.

647
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,400
I'm sorry.

648
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,020
I shouldn't havegotten angry at you.

649
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,660
Your choices areyour choices.

650
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,940
You're not like me.

651
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,010
Maybe you have wings.

652
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,790
I have huntington's chorea.

653
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,070
Dozen years or so,

654
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:34,120
my nervous system,my cognitive
skills, even my emotional balance...

655
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,970
they'll all start to fray.

656
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,740
I won't be able to fly.

657
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,360
I won't be able to walk.

658
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,340
I won't be able to breathe.

659
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,870
And you want to make
sureyour life matters.

660
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,900
I don't want to just...

661
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:57,510
be tightening boltsand
following instructions.

662
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,770
I want something...

663
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,510
to be different because of me.

664
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,560
I am.

665
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,090
Not just 'causeyou saved my life.

666
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,680
I'm applying for a jobat a foundation.

667
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,990
Running the finance division.

668
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:25,290
I mean, I don't knowif I'm
gonna get it, but if I don'T...

669
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,550
there are other foundations.

670
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,800
it's almost 4:00.

671
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,210
Soap time.

672
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,250
Nurses' remote.

673
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,150
Works in the doctors' lounge.

674
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,990
Why do you thinkwilson's leaving?

675
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,120
How many times do I haveto
use the word "idiot"?

676
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,880
And that's a good enough answerfor you?

677
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,670
Whenever anyone does
anythingout of the norm,

678
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,650
you have to tell themwhat screwed-up
process is really at workin their head.

679
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,730
That is why I lockedthe
two of you in a room.

680
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,970
So you would say somethingstupid and
insensitive, and maybewith a little bit of truth.

681
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,330
But you didn'T.

682
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:11,250
So I can only assume that
youdon't want to know the reason.

683
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,610
You're afraid to know.

684
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,890
You're not listening to me,are you?

685
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,410
Try it sometime. You'll see why.

686
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,140
You look 37.

687
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,850
I am 37.

688
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,450
You looked 27 last week.

689
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,700
Unless I blacked outfor
ten years.Your skin--

690
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,060
she's got lymphoma.The
chemo's probably--

691
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,870
stop the chemo.

692
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,520
She's getting better. Bradycardia's
improving.We didn't need--

693
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,830
she have bruising?

694
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,650
She was pounding her
legsduring the hallucinations.

695
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,940
It's not lymphoma.

696
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,180
Hey, don't--
no, no, no.

697
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,300
My bad. Thought no meant yes.

698
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,850
Those aren't bruises.
They're mycobacterial lesions.

699
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,870
She has diffuselepromatous leprosy.

700
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,420
Must have caught it on one of
her overseas estrogen tours.

701
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,790
Chemo wipes out some of the
bacteria, she feels a little better.

702
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,530
Wipes out mostof her immune
system, she gets a whole lot worse.

703
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,220
Leprosy? Like where my limbsfall off?

704
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,980
Actually, this isthe flattering one.

705
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's also knownas "pretty leprosy."

706
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,360
It doesn't disfigure, it makes
your skin look younger, smoother.

707
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,810
Don't let the girls hear.

708
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,490
They'll all want to lick your face.

709
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,140
Unless you're that kindof feminist.

710
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,090
Blast her with antibioticsand
prednisone. She'll be fine.

711
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,260
Damn, it's after 4:00. I'm late.

712
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,400
- Damn.
- What?

713
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,780
She's happyyou're gonna be fine.

714
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,930
But she'd be happierif you were
gonna be fine five minutes ago.

715
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,290
Tests confirmeddr. House's diagnosis.

716
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,750
Thank god.

717
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,950
When you got pregnant, the physical
stress triggeredE. Nodosum leprosum.

718
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,550
A common complicationof leprosy.

719
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,280
Inflamed the nervesto your heart.

720
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:21,070
Made it hardto absorb vitamins,
scarred your fallopian tubes.

721
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,600
It explains everything.

722
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,840
Better prescribe mesome
skin cream too, huh?

723
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,870
You might want itfor
those job interviews.

724
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,610
I'm going back on the roadwith
patty. My replacement flamed out.

725
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:42,140
She says I can managesome projects
on my own, carve out more of a role.

726
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,130
Do you really thinkshe can change?

727
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:51,290
I don't know.The truth
is,I'm not sure I--

728
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,760
you can change.

729
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:55,410
No...

730
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,780
I'm not sureI want her to change.

731
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:04,740
She's reasonable. She's just
another employer,and I'm just...

732
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,490
another employee.

733
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,730
In a weird way, I matter.

734
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,630
I like you betternow that you're dying.

735
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,970
I was wrong.

736
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,050
You took a shot.

737
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:31,160
She's going back to workfor that idiot.

738
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,070
It's pathetic.

739
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,940
You thought somethingwould change?

740
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:40,590
She almost diedbecause of
that job.Yeah, I--I thought--

741
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,820
almost dying changes nothing.

742
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,320
Dying changes everything.

743
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,030
I'm sorry.

744
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,150
I know i didn't try to kill her.

745
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,310
I know ididn't want her hurt.

746
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,660
I know it wasa freak accident.

747
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:33,310
But I feel like crap,and
she's dead because of me.

748
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,530
I don't blame you.

749
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,610
I wanted to. I tried to.

750
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:44,920
I must have reviewedamber's case
file 100 times to find a way.

751
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,180
But it wasn't your fault.

752
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,360
Then we're okay?

753
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,250
I mean, I know you're not, but...

754
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,440
maybe I can help.

755
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,170
We're not okay.

756
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,970
Amber was never the reasonI was leaving.

757
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,710
I didn't want to
tell you because--

758
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:17,720
because I was trying,like
I always do, to protect you.

759
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,740
Which is the problem.

760
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:26,490
You spread misery becauseyou
can't feel anything else.

761
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,510
You manipulate people because you can't
handle any kind of real relationship.

762
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,330
And I've enabled it. For years.

763
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:38,680
The games, the binges, the
middle-of-the-nightphone calls.

764
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,060
I should have been the
oneon the bus, not--

765
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,880
you should have en aloneon the bus.

766
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,700
If I've learned anythingfrom amber,
it's that I have to take careof myself.

767
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,880
We're not friendsanymore, house.

768
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,380
I'm not sure we ever were.
