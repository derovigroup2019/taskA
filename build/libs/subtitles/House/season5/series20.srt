in for credit
on the last patient.

And the patient's illness
wasn't caused by her husband,

Can't. She's demanding
to be released

Seeing his wife in distress
might have actually
slowed down his death.

to hit the singles market.

00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,750
Polyserositis fits.
Start her on indomethacin.

173
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,494
CUDDY: If you'd rather
not deal with this case...

174
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,662
I'm fine, despite
what Wilson will say.

175
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,965
He hasn't come to you?

176
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,438
Pretty sure
he has Mah-jong
Tuesday mornings.

177
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,031
I assume he thinks
that I will work
through this better

178
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,739
if I don't have to keep
flicking his wings
off my shoulder.

179
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,080
You didn't even
have an inkling?

180
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,110
I know his fantasy
football team cratered,
figured he'd gotten over it.

181
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,651
Well...

182
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,761
Sorry for your loss.

183
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,599
Thanks.
It's not my loss.

184
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,293
Then I'm sorry
you don't think it is.

185
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,349
Patient's membranes
aren't going to
heal themselves.

187

We'd like to go
see Kutner's parents.

188
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,853
I'll join you.

189
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:45,698
Polyserositis damages
the protective covering
around tissue and organs.

190
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:49,434
The indomethacin is simply
an anti-inflammatory,
but it should fix it.

191
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,442
Just make
the pain stop.

192
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,840

193
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,280
Close your eyes.

194
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,479
Now.

195

made it down to Rio.

You never talk like this.

200
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,530
Yeah, just shut up
and let me do this.

201
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,305
And you're on
that balcony, and you are
watching the Mardi Gras.

202

It's called Carnival.

203

to go without you.

I want you to.

205
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,954
And I want it to be
everything
you've ever dreamed of.

206
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:46,591
Sorry to interrupt,
but I'd like to
run one more test.

207
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,797

first day we got him.
He was six.

Sweetest little boy

FOREMAN:
Must have been scary,

211
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,842
going through a trauma,
and then being handed off
to a new family.

212
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,320
We kept telling him
to call us
Richard and Julia,

213
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,584
but it was always
Mr. And Mrs. Kutner.

214
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,387
Then, on his ninth birthday,
we gave him a chemistry set.

215
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,721
(CHUCKLES)
Lawrence always loved
blowing things up.

216
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:26,367
And he said,
"Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Dad."

217
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,374
That's who we were
from then on.

218
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,045
He was pretty special.
We were lucky to have him.

219
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,345
You spent the most time
with him.

220
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,221
He spoke so highly
of all of you.

221
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,018
Do you have any idea...

222
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,557
I wish we did.

HOUSE: It was his name.

224
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,029
He was conflicted.
Didn't know
where he fit in.

225
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,105
Being ripped out of his world
and stuck into yours.

226
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,699
We encouraged him
to hold on
to his heritage.

to still be
Lawrence Choudhary

228

when everyone sees you
as Lawrence Kutner.

229
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,948
It was his idea
to take our name.

230
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,916
You should have said no.
House.

231
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,455
All his Anglo name gave him
was the illusion that
he was someone he wasn't.

232
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,717
You were being emotional,
not rational.

233
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,420
You didn't understand him.

234
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,984
We loved that boy,
you son of a bitch.

235
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,793
You wanted to make him happy
by shutting out his pain.

236
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,027
When he looked happy,
you assumed
the pain had gone,

237
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,297
but it just
got buried deeper,

238
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,869
leaving him tormented
about who he was, until
finally he put a bullet...

I'm sorry
about your son.

Indomethacin had no effect,
she's still in pain.
Rules out polyserositis.

243
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,685
I ran a hormone panel
on Eddie.

244
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,483
His prolactin's
above normal.

245
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,250
Means
he's actually improving.

Body chemistry changes
for all sorts of reasons.

Stress, fear,
why not love?

248
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,298
Maybe he's going into
some sort of remission.

249
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,494
You haven't asked
if I learned anything
relevant from the Kutners.

250
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,433
If you had, I'm sure
you'd have mentioned it.

251
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,269
Or you're just afraid
there is something relevant,

252
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,604
which would mean
you could have saved him.

253
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,804
I don't buy that suicide
is always a cry for help.

254
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,972
Sometimes you just
don't want help.

255
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,216
Good thing
you got some,

256
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,016

Kidney function's normal.

It's not byssinosis,
it's not
mitral valve stenosis.

260
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,291
Nothing fits.

261
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,635
If it doesn't fit
any diagnosis,

262
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,070
that just leaves
one diagnosis.

His heart is too weak,
yours is too strong.

Good news is
it's fixable.

We induce a massive
heart attack and
kill off the extra muscle.

268
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,745
You want to give me
a heart attack?

269
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,155
It's only dangerous
if your heart
is normal-sized.

Are you serious?

No.

very annoying,

She's faking.

And, yes,
if she keeps faking,

do something
that will kill her.

How could she be...

That was real.
The treatment
made her better.

But good for her
was bad for you,
which was bad for her,

00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,182
so she made herself bad.
It's all so simple.

that the sicker she was,

We're not just gonna
leave them to die

Technically,
he's not our patient,

514
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,271
so I'm really only
leaving her to die.

515

We've already explored
the usual options,

516

explore unusual ones?

we should just
come clean with Cuddy.

Wow, if only
he were here to say that.

520

bound to fall for the old,

00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,907
Unless you feel
there's more to do here
to cure me,

678
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,499
don't you have
the funeral to go to?

679
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,076
(DOOR CLOSING)

680
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,841
<i>I'm taking a ride</i>

681
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:46,816
<i>Off to one side</i>

682
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:51,320
<i>It is a personal thing</i>

683
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,491
<i>Where?</i>
<i>When I can't stand</i>

684
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,592
<i>Up in this cage</i>
<i>I'm not regretting</i>

685
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:08,398
<i>I don't need a better thing</i>

686
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,800
<i>I'll settle for less</i>

687
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:19,716
<i>It's another thing for me</i>

688
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:24,384
<i>I just have to wander</i>

689
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:29,822
<i>Through this world alone</i>

690
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,994
(INAUDIBLE)

691
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:56,082
<i>Stop before you fall</i>

692
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:02,092
<i>Into the hole</i>
<i>that I have dug here</i>

693
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:07,491
<i>Rest even as you</i>

694
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:13,963
<i>Are starting to feel</i>
<i>the way I used to</i>

695
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:20,570
<i>I don't need a better thing</i>

696
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:25,308
<i>Just to sound confused</i>

697
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:31,951
<i>Don't talk about everyone</i>

698
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:39,686
<i>I am not amused by you</i>

699
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,924
<i>'Cause I'm gonna lose you</i>

700
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:51,605
<i>Yes, I'm gonna lose you</i>

701
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:57,309
<i>If I'm gonna lose you</i>

702
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,922
<i>'Cause I'm gonna lose you</i>

703
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,695
<i>Yes, I'm gonna lose you</i>

704
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:20,695
<i>If I'm gonna lose you</i>

705
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:28,468
<i>I'll lose you now for good</i>
