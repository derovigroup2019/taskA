1
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:42,955
You have a patient waiting.
See?

2
00:00:43,023 --> 00:00:44,257
I'm waiting
for a follow-up.

3
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:46,192
If you're talking
about Mr. Casdin,

4
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,007
he has a "deceased"
sticker on his file,

5
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,864
as do all the other follow-ups
you have scheduled for today.

6
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:55,434
Whoops.

7
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:06,712
I had colds all winter.

8
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,314
Well, I've been
in this room awhile,

9
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:10,316
but it's spring now, right?

10
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:11,651
I feel run-down

11
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:14,020
like maybe something big
is coming on.

12
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:16,389
Run-down.
Come on, give me something.

13
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:18,157
Sore throat?
- No.

14
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:20,026
Runny nose?
- No.

15
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:21,427
I know it sounds weird,
I'm a nurse,

16
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:24,697
but could you run
maybe a CBC or thyroid up--

17
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:37,677
Dr. Cuddy,
I need a consult.

18
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:42,748
Until she stops seizing,
I may as well

19
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:44,984
go back to my office
and get my diagnosis on.

20
00:01:45,052 --> 00:01:46,519
She's urinating on herself.

21
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:48,788
She's having a seizure.
If she hadn't peed--

22
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:51,123
It's green.

23
00:01:54,294 --> 00:01:56,195
Interesting.

24
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:31,163
35-year-old woman.

25
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:33,065
Head of nursing
at an old-age home.

26
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:37,737
Neurological symptoms
and "P"?

27
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:39,939
Oh, green pee.
I get it.

28
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:41,807
Nice.

29
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,509
"Neuro" is also
written in green.

30
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:46,812
Does that mean she has green
neurological symptoms as well?

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,381
From now on,
I'm gonna use two colors.

32
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,916
Green indicates irony.

33
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:51,284
Pseudomonas infection.

34
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:53,019
She'd have a fever.
Toxins?

35
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:54,620
Why are we taking
this case?

36
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:56,789
Welcome, your lordship.

37
00:02:56,857 --> 00:02:58,925
We were just preparing
your morning briefing.

38
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:00,660
Sorry I'm late.

39
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,795
And, yes,
green pee does meet

40
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:04,730
the only diagnostic requirement
you care about--

41
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:06,132
It's interesting.

42
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,234
But is it worth
us taking this case?

43
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:10,536
"Us" aren't
taking anything.

44
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:12,271
I'm taking.
You're accepting.

45
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:14,707
Okay, I accept.

46
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,876
She has adult-onset epilepsy,

47
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:19,145
and she really likes
those St. Patrick's day beers.

48
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:21,580
Go check out
the house and the office

49
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:23,049
for toxins and infections.

50
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:24,350
Her neuro exam was normal.

51
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:26,953
No subsequent seizures.

52
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,888
It's not life-threatening.
It's not important.

53
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:31,557
Luckily neither are you.

54
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:41,834
You okay?

55
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:43,035
I'm fine.

56
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:44,837
You and House this morning,

57
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:46,272
the way you were arguing.

58
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:50,743
Airing disagreements
doesn't qualify as arguing.

59
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:52,878
Come on, man.

60
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:56,983
I'm just trying to help.
We're friends.

61
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,417
There are
400 Japanese teenagers

62
00:03:58,485 --> 00:03:59,719
<i>you were playing Halo</i>
with last night

63
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:01,320
you're better friends with.

64
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:03,589
Your avatar should ask
their avatars

65
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,157
how they're doing.

66
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:07,026
I consider you
a good friend

67
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:10,896
even if we don't hang
that much outside work.

68
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:12,832
I wasn't arguing with him.

69
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:13,899
You kinda were.

70
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:16,602
Fine, I was.

71
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,105
And you know what,
I was right.

72
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:20,673
You got conned.

73
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:21,974
Methylthioninium
chloride.

74
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:24,443
Notable side effect,
green urine.

75
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:26,078
She's a nurse.
She knows the dosage.

76
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:27,613
Knows how to fake a seizure.

77
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,949
She pees pea soup and gets
the warm attention of doctors

78
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:31,517
all week long.

79
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:33,152
She's a Munchausen,
and you're her mark.

80
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,021
So you're insight
is based on discovering

81
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,556
an anti-alzheimer's drug
at an old-age home.

82
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:39,358
No good reason
it'd be sitting in her desk.

83
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:40,693
You ever tried
to pee on yourself in public?

84
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:42,194
It's not easy.

85
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:43,562
Sorry, I rushed
the jewish frat.

86
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,663
We peed in private.

87
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:45,731
For good reason.

88
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,434
I can spot
a fake seizure.

89
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:50,036
Which means this was real.

90
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:52,738
Which means her problem
is phenol.

91
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,907
Carbolic acid?

92
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:58,044
Yeah, maybe she
accidentally inhaled some

93
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:00,980
at a gout treatment facility
circa 1890.

94
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:02,982
It's still in some
antiseptic throat sprays.

95
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,284
She's been chugging it
all winter for her colds.

96
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,486
Phenol explains the seizure
and the urine.

97
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,288
She'd have to drink
five bottles a day.

98
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:10,756
Which is why I'm sure
you won't have trouble

99
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:13,059
discovering evidence of it
when you search her house.

100
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:16,195
Bye.

101
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:18,964
And you can start her on
charcoal hemoperfusion

102
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,100
for the phenol poisoning.

103
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:24,336
Seriously?

104
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:27,073
Oh, you were lying
about the throat spray.

105
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,707
That does make more sense.

106
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:31,577
So why are you
wasting Taub's time?

107
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:33,079
Because I don't
want him to know that I'm

108
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:36,182
wasting my time disproving
his fake seizure theory.

109
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:37,750
Zip.

110
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,158
Chris?

111
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:49,161
Chris Taub, right?

112
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:50,729
Neil Zane.

113
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:52,965
I was two years under you
at Collegiate High, remember?

114
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,834
Sure.

115
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:56,535
So you're some
big doctor here now?

116
00:05:56,603 --> 00:06:00,005
<i>I'm a doctor.</i>
You?

117
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:01,640
Well, I was speaking
at an Econ course

118
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,908
over at the University.

119
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:05,244
I tripped and banged my leg.

120
00:06:05,312 --> 00:06:07,046
I have some time.

121
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:08,814
Come with me.

122
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:13,319
Hi.
Tests back?

123
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:16,622
Head CT was negative.

124
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,657
What about
a thyroid uptake

125
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:20,326
or abdominal ultrasound?

126
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:21,927
Sure.

127
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,597
How 'bout I flash some lights
in front of your face first?

128
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:26,298
You want me to have
another seizure?

129
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:27,633
We're gonna have
to give up the room

130
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:30,269
unless we can
confirm a problem.

131
00:06:30,337 --> 00:06:31,670
Okay.

132
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,327
Damn it.

133
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:57,463
Oh, God.

134
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:59,632
Please forgive me.
I'm so sorry.

135
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,400
What are you
worried about?

136
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,402
Maybe a night in jail
for fraud.

137
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,504
I have to go tell one
of my employees he was right.

138
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:06,739
I'm not a Munchausen.

139
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:08,641
I'm gonna die
unless you help me.

140
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,176
You'll have to come up
with something more original.

141
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,811
A cat predicted my death.

142
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:18,250
Cats make terrible doctors.

143
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:20,052
Oh, no, wait,
that's women.

144
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,687
You're screwed.

145
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,458
How'd you slip?

146
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:29,461
Oh, I've had this dizziness
problem for a while now.

147
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:31,197
You get checked
for labyrinthitis?

148
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:32,932
On antibiotics
for a week.

149
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,300
No difference.

150
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:35,501
Lie down a sec.

151
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:37,403
Whoa, whoa, I'm dizzy.

152
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,872
That's normal.

153
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,473
So what are you teaching?

154
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,108
Entrepreneurship.

155
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:45,010
I'm a CEO,
Osttech Industries.

156
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,545
We make medical devices.

157
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:49,515
All right,
you can sit up.

158
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,483
So did that
tell you anything?

159
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,053
Did I--

160
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,488
Oh, my God.

161
00:07:56,556 --> 00:07:58,591
The--you just cured me.

162
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:00,626
I figured you had
a tiny calcium deposit

163
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:02,494
in your inner ear;
I just shifted it around.

164
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:06,365
I've seen
three doctors for this.

165
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm buying you dinner.

166
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:09,735
Forget it.
- Come on.

167
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:11,303
I'm also in investor
in a club.

168
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:12,905
We'll make it a night out.

169
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:15,841
No, I'm married,
boring.

170
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,943
I know some married
people who aren't boring.

171
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,212
A few years back,

172
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,381
I was one of them.

173
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:23,415
Good luck.

174
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:32,558
If you're gonna
kill me and rape me,

175
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:33,959
please do it in that order.

176
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:36,195
This is the cat, Debbie.
Have you heard of her?

177
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:37,596
Debbie.

178
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:38,964
Sorry but without
a last name--

179
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:40,466
She was in the news.

180
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:43,068
We found her as a kitten.
She lives in the nursing home.

181
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:45,638
She only sleeps next to people
when they're about to die.

182
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:47,640
Ten patients
in the last year.

183
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:49,808
And then yesterday
she did it to me

184
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:52,444
while I was sitting
on my couch.

185
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:54,413
Please, the whole staff,
the doctors even,

186
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:56,115
we all know this is real.

187
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:57,850
Can you come back later?

188
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,451
I have some business
I'm conducting

189
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,221
with the Prince of Nigeria.

190
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:04,356
Just watch this video.

191
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:07,293
It'll prove
I'm not lying.

192
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,130
Dr. House, I'm begging you.

193
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:19,138
Chest.

194
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,175
Quick!

195
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,644
Before she goes without
attention for eight seconds.

196
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:27,680
House.

197
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:33,786
She's faking.
The cat told me.

198
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:35,220
Listen.

199
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,192
Soft breath sounds.

200
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,627
Means it's bronchospasm.

201
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:46,031
Can't fake that.

202
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:02,456
When Debbie climbs
on a patient's bed

203
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:03,858
and goes to sleep,

204
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:05,693
we call the loved ones
and tell them to come in.

205
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:07,461
You want to treat her?

206
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:08,696
She's a nutjob.

207
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:10,865
Don't we all have quirks?

208
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,067
Aren't those eccentricities
what make us human?

209
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:14,302
It's like Debbie's
here on earth

210
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:16,370
to bring people
to the other side.

211
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:18,472
Also agreed
is the cat does seem--

212
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,108
Nutjobs get sick too.

213
00:10:21,176 --> 00:10:26,047
So you think
this cat story is nonsense.

214
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:29,083
And you admit she faked
her earlier symptoms.

215
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:31,619
But you still think
she's actually sick now?

216
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:33,487
Well, anything
would sound ridiculous

217
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:34,722
If you said it
in that voice.

218
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,657
Confirm she's faking

219
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:38,059
or I'm gonna have
to kick her out.

220
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:39,594
There's that voice again.

221
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:40,928
I'll give you 24 hours.

222
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:44,365
Consecutive?

223
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:52,240
What are you doing?

224
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:56,077
No, Mr. Bond,
I expect you to die.

225
00:10:56,144 --> 00:10:57,945
Bronchospasm, go.

226
00:10:58,013 --> 00:10:59,580
Bronchitis.

227
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:00,815
No cough, no fever.

228
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:01,916
And Blofeld
didn't smoke a cigar.

229
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:03,584
He might have.

230
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:05,987
Dude had a lair.
Means he was rich.

231
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:08,489
Rich people enjoy
a good stogie.

232
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:11,158
Sometimes send them
as gifts.

233
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:14,629
Hey, Taub, did that sound
like I was awkwardly

234
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:16,397
trying to segue
into making a point?

235
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:17,732
Yes.

236
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,933
Emphysema.

237
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:20,735
Lungs were clean
on the CT.

238
00:11:20,802 --> 00:11:22,903
Dogs can be trained
to predict diabetic comas,

239
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:25,373
epileptic seizures;
they can smell cancer.

240
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,341
It is possible there's
something in this cat.

241
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:29,543
It's more possible
that it was just a coincidence.

242
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:32,013
10 million nursing homes.
100 million pet cats.

243
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,181
One of them was bound
to pick a few winners.

244
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:35,983
Debbie was able to predict
there was something wrong

245
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:37,218
with the patient
before you were.

246
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:38,819
Is that a coincidence too?

247
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:40,655
Maybe the cat
didn't predict anything.

248
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:41,989
Might have caused the deaths.

249
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:44,225
We shoulda listened
to Ted Nugent.

250
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:46,227
Yeah, it could
be cat scratch fever

251
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:47,795
or visceral larva migrans.

252
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:49,563
Maybe he didn't kill
everyone at the nursing home,

253
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,365
but it may be killing Morgan.

254
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:53,367
The worms hop from the cat
to the cat lady's lungs.

255
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:54,535
I could buy that.

256
00:11:54,603 --> 00:11:56,570
Those cigars were for me.

257
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:59,874
Hey, that reminds me,
why is some fancy CEO

258
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:02,209
sending you a box
of Cuban cigars?

259
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:03,878
Is it related
to your money worries?

260
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:05,546
What money worries?

261
00:12:05,614 --> 00:12:07,048
Extrapolating
from the fact

262
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:08,582
that he's been skipping
his morning muffin,

263
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,685
I'd say that he lost
almost all his money

264
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:12,687
on the market last year.

265
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:14,789
I'm on a diet.

266
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:17,858
I'm also extrapolating
from the online portfolio

267
00:12:17,926 --> 00:12:22,229
you forgot to log off,
but it's mostly the muffins.

268
00:12:22,297 --> 00:12:23,664
Scope her for worms
in the lungs.

269
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:32,206
We could help out in there.

270
00:12:32,274 --> 00:12:34,775
Yeah, it takes
at least four people

271
00:12:34,843 --> 00:12:36,844
to look inside
a crazy woman's lungs

272
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:38,779
for imaginary worms.

273
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:40,247
So you're
in a good mood again.

274
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:42,016
You need another speech

275
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:43,284
about what
a great friend I am?

276
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:48,923
I'm telling my wife
we don't need to downsize,

277
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,292
but maybe we do.

278
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,528
You really lost
all that money?

279
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:56,731
I don't care about the money.
I just feel bad for Rachel.

280
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:58,532
She married a guy
in one situation

281
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,768
and ended up with another;
that's hard on anyone.

282
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:02,269
Thanks.

283
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:04,105
Makes me feel much better
hearing my wife's a gold digger.

284
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:07,141
No, I just meant she married
this master of the universe,

285
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,277
successful surgeon,
and now he's basically,

286
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:13,381
you know, a flunky
for this mad scientist...

287
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:15,549
who saves lives,
so that's good.

288
00:13:17,886 --> 00:13:19,620
There are no worms
in the lungs.

289
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,825
What else
could cause bronchospasm?

290
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:26,293
Severe acid reflux.

291
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:27,895
No esophagitis.
It's not reflux.

292
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:29,563
Why are you pushing
a crash cart?

293
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:31,632
Because patients
sometimes crash.

294
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,534
And they haven't yet invented
a crash tractor

295
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:37,905
for me to drive
wildly around the hallways.

296
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:40,508
Why are we in
the coma patients' room?

297
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:46,447
You actually think
the cat is going to predict

298
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:47,948
someone's death?

299
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:50,050
No, I know the cat
the not going to predict

300
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:51,685
anyone's death.

301
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:53,754
Then I will have
scientifically disproved--

302
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:55,589
You didn't keep
this patient despite the cat.

303
00:13:55,657 --> 00:13:57,391
You kept this patient
because of the cat.

304
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,726
You're scared
there's something to it.

305
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:01,495
If I could prove

306
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:03,397
the non-existence
of an omniscient God

307
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:05,933
who lovingly guides us
to the other side, I would.

308
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:08,569
Cat version's
gonna have to do.

309
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:12,173
Are you scared?

310
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,407
Cats brains
are always in alpha mode.

311
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:15,409
The few scientific tests

312
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:17,044
that have seemed to confirm
physic phenomena,

313
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:18,379
that's where it takes place.

314
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:19,747
Please tell me
that you were kidding

315
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:20,781
so I won't have to fire you.

316
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:21,949
I was kidding.

317
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:24,618
We still have
a human patient, right?

318
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:26,153
Airborne allergens possible?

319
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:28,122
Skin test was negative.
- Lungs may be more sensitive.

320
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,624
Or House just screwed up.

321
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:32,226
If you misinterpreted
the breath sounds

322
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,928
as soft instead of loud,

323
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:36,263
it's laryngospasm instead
of bronchospasm,

324
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:38,666
which you can get
from a simple panic attack,

325
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:40,167
which she was having.

326
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:42,002
I also heard
the lung sounds too, Taub.

327
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,270
You saying I screwed up?

328
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:47,975
"Screwed up"
is maybe too harsh, but yes.

329
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:49,643
Don't you want
to check their charts?

330
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:50,711
Of course not.

331
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,546
This is a double-blind.

332
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:54,682
I don't want to even
subconsciously signal

333
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:55,983
to Teddy
which one's the sickest.

334
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:58,052
Her name's Debbie.

335
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:00,821
Are those welts
on that guy's arm?

336
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:03,190
Were they here
when we got here?

337
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:08,262
He has a severe cat allergy.

338
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:15,302
That never happened.

339
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,370
Look at Debbie.

340
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:24,011
Good news,

341
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,414
Mister...Limpert,

342
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:29,884
when you don't die tonight

343
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:32,987
you will finally have done
something good for the world

344
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:34,688
as opposed
to your life as a...

345
00:15:34,756 --> 00:15:36,524
fireman.

346
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:40,461
Foreman's airborne allergen
theory makes the most sense.

347
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:42,630
Do a methacholine challenge
on catgirl to check it out.

348
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:53,107
I told you to get rid
of "death cat".

349
00:15:53,174 --> 00:15:54,441
Do you see a cat?

350
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:56,810
I see a litter box.

351
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:59,513
This is a disability,
Dr. Cuddy.

352
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:00,948
Can't make it
to the men's room on time.

353
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:03,417
You pee on the mice too?

354
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:05,252
Well, now you see
the mice actually prove

355
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,954
that I don't have a cat.

356
00:16:07,022 --> 00:16:09,223
Are these--

357
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,425
are these the genetically
modified lab mice

358
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:12,826
from oncology?

359
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:15,129
Genetically modified
for tastiness.

360
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:19,600
Get rid of the cat,

361
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,435
and get rid
of your patient.

362
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,437
My team's doing
a methacholine challenge.

363
00:16:23,505 --> 00:16:25,506
Your team just completed
a methacholine challenge,

364
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:27,141
which came up negative.

365
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,443
Who told you
about the test?

366
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:30,611
Taub?

367
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,479
I'll never say, but yes.

368
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:35,182
Her airways clamped down.
I heard it.

369
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,052
We kick her onto the street,
it could happen again.

370
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:40,054
I wish there was a lawsuit cat.
It could warn you.

371
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:42,389
I'm sorry, but if you
won't escort her out,

372
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:44,858
I'll have to get security
to do it.

373
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,236
I don't smoke.

374
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:00,570
Fine.

375
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:01,905
If you don't want
the seventh graders

376
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:03,440
to think you're cool.

377
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:10,580
I went through your purse.

378
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:13,283
Horoscopes.
Good luck charms.

379
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:16,152
You went to a good college,
good nursing school.

380
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,555
So you weren't always
a superstitious idiot.

381
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:19,890
I'm not a super--

382
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,825
How 'bout four years,

383
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:23,927
that sound right?

384
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:25,795
That's when you switched
from a family insurance plan

385
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:27,230
to the one you're on now.

386
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:30,033
I was married.
I got divorced.

387
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:31,968
Two years before that,

388
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:34,404
you got chicken pox shots,

389
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:37,574
which you only get in adulthood
when you have a kid.

390
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:39,676
Or I should say
when you had a kid

391
00:17:39,744 --> 00:17:42,212
because no kid
has come to visit you.

392
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,315
Which all makes me think
something bad happened.

393
00:17:49,253 --> 00:17:51,221
It was my stepson,
Timothy.

394
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:57,260
What happened?

395
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,396
He was in school.

396
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:01,731
He was having
his morning snack.

397
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,833
And he choked.

398
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:05,835
And the teacher saw it,

399
00:18:05,903 --> 00:18:08,705
and they did everything
that they were supposed to.

400
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:11,641
He shouldn't have died.

401
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,944
You want to make it
make sense.

402
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:19,249
What's wrong with that?

403
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:22,185
It's meaningless,
is what's wrong.

404
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:24,587
What's wrong is that
it doesn't do a thing

405
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,324
to bring your kid back

406
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:30,427
or put you and your ex
together again.

407
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:37,300
Rash on your neck.

408
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:40,837
Probably not enough
for Cuddy.

409
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:43,206
I can't breathe.

410
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:45,475
Hey, doc.

411
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:49,646
Breath sound soft to you,
doc?

412
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,017
Hooray!
You're officially sick.

413
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:02,359
Churg-Strauss fits best.

414
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:03,760
Here's the plan--

415
00:19:03,828 --> 00:19:06,229
Taub, you change
the litter box.

416
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:08,465
This is pathetic.

417
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,867
You're still punishing me
for calling you out

418
00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:12,969
on the green urine lady?

419
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:14,738
Nope, this is for
ratting me out to Cuddy.

420
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,339
I'm not asking you
to apologize,

421
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,541
just scoop some poop
out of a box.

422
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:21,611
Just clean it.

423
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,946
Let House do it.

424
00:19:23,014 --> 00:19:24,547
Yeah, that'll happen.

425
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:27,384
He won't just continue to let
our room smell like cat pee.

426
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:30,353
I'll clean it next time.

427
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:31,588
I'm outta here.

428
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,466
Now that you've delivered
that important lesson,

429
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:44,901
I'm gonna go
test the patient.

430
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:46,169
Whoa!

431
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,373
What, you think your bag's
gonna die now?

432
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:52,108
Now you're punishing me

433
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:53,510
because you think
I'm superstitious?

434
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:55,045
What do you care?

435
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,746
It's not so much
about me caring per se.

436
00:19:56,814 --> 00:19:57,947
It's more about me wondering
why you're such

437
00:19:58,015 --> 00:19:59,482
a credulous idiot.

438
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,317
Thirteen,
start the patient on steroids

439
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:04,320
for the Churg-Strauss.

440
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:05,755
Unless we have something
we need to argue about.

441
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:13,963
This is good stuff.

442
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:15,565
The best.

443
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:16,866
It's made from
the distilled sweat

444
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:19,302
of recently laid-off
hedge fund managers.

445
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,071
Aren't you happy
you came out tonight?

446
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,105
Yeah.

447
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:23,540
I wasn't actually going to,

448
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:26,776
but not the greatest day
at work.

449
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:29,279
I used to have
an office like this.

450
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:30,647
Used to?

451
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:32,449
When I was
a plastic surgeon.

452
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:34,951
But one day I took stock
of my life and--

453
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:40,924
Screw it.

454
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,126
I had an affair with the
daughter of one of my partners.

455
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:46,729
They signed a non-disclosure.
I signed a non-compete.

456
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:48,665
And the funny thing is

457
00:20:48,732 --> 00:20:50,667
I wound up
telling my wife anyway.

458
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:55,939
You like your job?

459
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,141
Same as you.
Same as everyone.

460
00:20:58,209 --> 00:21:01,044
It has its ups and downs.

461
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:04,914
You're lying
to make me feel better.

462
00:21:04,982 --> 00:21:07,217
Yeah, it's the best.

463
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:08,852
I'm in charge, you know?

464
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,320
I'm a kid with toys.

465
00:21:10,387 --> 00:21:12,155
Speaking of which,

466
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:13,756
what do you think
of the prototype?

467
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:15,458
It's amazing.

468
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:17,694
Gotta make it
a half-inch smaller though.

469
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:20,130
You serious?

470
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:22,098
I got small hands,
6.5 gloves, like women surgeons,

471
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,800
which are your
fastest-growing market.

472
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:26,469
Meaning the girls
would have to use two hands

473
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,371
to hit the switch.

474
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:31,141
Why do I bother paying
the idiots that work for me?

475
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,776
Put down
that crap you're drinking,

476
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:37,614
because I am breaking out
the really good stuff.

477
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:53,496
What's wrong?

478
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,598
I went to the bathroom.
My urine--

479
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,766
Green again?

480
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:58,034
It's brown.

481
00:21:58,102 --> 00:22:00,937
I didn't do anything,
honest.

482
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:12,772
It is possible
she's still faking.

483
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,674
She didn't fake
the for the bronchospasm.

484
00:22:14,742 --> 00:22:17,911
You think she's faking
some stuff but not other stuff?

485
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:19,579
Maybe she's "Unchausen".

486
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:22,449
I'm just saying the brown
urine doesn't make sense.

487
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:31,892
What?

488
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,860
Nothing.

489
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:35,762
We've ruled out every
possible cause for brown urine.

490
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,364
No blood in the urine.

491
00:22:37,431 --> 00:22:39,166
Liver and kidneys fine.

492
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,767
Brown could be fecal.
A fistula--

493
00:22:40,835 --> 00:22:42,135
We checked.

494
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:44,004
How do we know the urine
is still brown?

495
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,138
Had to be.

496
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:47,974
Once you've gone brown--

497
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:49,309
If we've ruled out

498
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:51,511
Everything that can make
the urine brown,

499
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,113
what if it just looked brown?

500
00:22:53,181 --> 00:22:55,282
If the green dye
never left her system,

501
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:58,485
what plus green makes brown?

502
00:22:58,553 --> 00:22:59,819
Purple.

503
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:03,089
Strep Bovis infection
from colon cancer.

504
00:23:03,157 --> 00:23:06,826
Paraneoplastic syndrome
would explain the bronchospasm.

505
00:23:06,894 --> 00:23:08,395
We scoped her when we
checked for the fistula.

506
00:23:08,462 --> 00:23:10,197
There's no tumor.

507
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:11,731
Oh, no.

508
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,568
I wasn't scared
by the umbrella either.

509
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:15,835
What?

510
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:17,871
Not everything's
about you, Kutner.

511
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,406
I realize it's stupid.

512
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:20,874
I just--
I don't know everything.

513
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,309
I don't want to invite--

514
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:24,311
Great, 'cause I thought
your superstitiousness

515
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:26,046
had to do with your folks
being killed.

516
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,582
But "you're stupid"
works just as well.

517
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:33,053
Why is there
a ladder here?

518
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,187
Oops.

519
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:35,722
Forgot that one.

520
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,159
Scopes don't work as well
as pillcams.

521
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:43,163
Give her one.
Find the tumor.

522
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:45,665
Come with me,
Tiny Taub.

523
00:23:52,873 --> 00:23:55,141
Come on.

524
00:24:03,084 --> 00:24:04,751
Sorry I was late again.

525
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,187
I've got a long commute
from the poor house.

526
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:08,989
Knew it when I hired you.

527
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:11,091
You'd eventually
miss the money,

528
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,094
being the big shot
like your new CEO friend,

529
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,495
if that nightclub stamp
on your hand

530
00:24:15,563 --> 00:24:17,364
is any indication.

531
00:24:17,431 --> 00:24:18,698
Don't worry,
I'm not quitting.

532
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:20,066
I know.

533
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:21,401
Guy who signs a non-compete

534
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:23,503
instead of just telling
his wife that he cheated

535
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:24,971
doesn't have
the guts to quit.

536
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,873
Bad example.
I did tell her.

537
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:29,109
From guilt,
not from courage.

538
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,545
And bravely running to Cuddy
behind my back.

539
00:24:32,613 --> 00:24:35,115
Arriving heroically
to work every day.

540
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,784
Cowards make lousy employees.

541
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:40,020
Maybe you're a coward,
maybe you're quitting.

542
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:41,921
Either way, I'm screwed.

543
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:55,402
You will note how
<i>faster pussycat kill, kill</i>

544
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:58,004
has snuggled up
by coma guy over there.

545
00:24:58,072 --> 00:25:01,608
And more importantly,
she did yesterday as well.

546
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:04,044
And he's still breathing.

547
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:05,945
We done?

548
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,130
Thank you
for showing me this.

549
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:26,933
But maybe she's just confused
in this new environment.

550
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:32,839
In 1844, a preacher
in upstate New York

551
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,774
added up some dates
in the bible

552
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:37,277
and predicted Jesus' return.

553
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:39,879
His followers gave away
all their possessions

554
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:41,648
and showed up in a field.

555
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:44,017
Guess who didn't show.

556
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,518
So the preacher said
that he miscalculated,

557
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,953
and they went right back
the next month

558
00:25:47,021 --> 00:25:48,321
but with more followers.

559
00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:50,824
Every time he was
irrefutably proved wrong,

560
00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:52,792
it redoubled
everyone's belief.

561
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,297
I know I sound
just like them.

562
00:25:57,365 --> 00:26:00,233
But I also know
you're wrong.

563
00:26:00,301 --> 00:26:03,636
Something terrible's
gonna happen to me.

564
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:19,352
You trying to prove
to her she's not dying?

565
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,055
That would be dumb,
as she might be dying.

566
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,690
This woman lost her kid.

567
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:25,225
Why are you attacking beliefs

568
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,593
that give her
a little bit of comfort?

569
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,027
I don't care
if her superstitions

570
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:29,229
make her feel better.

571
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,930
I just want her
to think more clearly.

572
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:33,066
Oh, maybe that could make
her as happy as you are.

573
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,972
Where are we going?

574
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,440
Experimenting.

575
00:26:43,377 --> 00:26:46,579
Stop it, Dr. Wilson.
It's just not cute anymore.

576
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:51,217
You already experimented
on the coma guy.

577
00:26:51,285 --> 00:26:52,886
Haven't you proved your point?

578
00:26:52,953 --> 00:26:54,187
Not to the patient.

579
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:55,955
And not to the millions
of idiots who drooled

580
00:26:56,023 --> 00:26:58,124
over that news item
about the magic cat.

581
00:26:58,192 --> 00:26:59,726
Why are you
so obsessed with this?

582
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:02,195
Can't you just call her an idiot
and leave everyone alone?

583
00:27:02,263 --> 00:27:04,230
Hey, look, kids,
therapy cat.

584
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:05,732
You're a liar.

585
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,101
Therapy animals are dogs,
not cats.

586
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,969
Aren't you feisty?

587
00:27:10,037 --> 00:27:11,838
This one's special.

588
00:27:11,906 --> 00:27:15,074
If she likes you,
interesting stuff happens.

589
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:19,546
Uh, kids,
playtime's over.

590
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,518
You know what,
this is a good thing.

591
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:27,220
Because either you're
starting to doubt yourself,

592
00:27:27,288 --> 00:27:28,888
which is healthy, or--

593
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:31,458
I don't believe in
the legend of good-bye kitty.

594
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,294
Or you're starting to give
a crap what other people think,

595
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,895
which is just another way
of saying you give a crap

596
00:27:35,963 --> 00:27:37,197
about other people.

597
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:38,698
I'd love to hear
more of your theory,

598
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:40,166
but I don't give a crap.

599
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:42,869
Also the pillcam's back.

600
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,173
Polypoid.

601
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:48,908
Raised edges.

602
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:51,010
Raised edges
are actually necessary,

603
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:52,946
since that's the opening
to the appendix.

604
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:54,347
How many times
are we gonna watch this?

605
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:56,516
There's no tumor.

606
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:58,251
Oh, my God.

607
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,486
The death cat
is attacking your legs.

608
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,387
You're gonna die.

609
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:04,190
Maybe it has something
to do with that little red dot

610
00:28:04,258 --> 00:28:05,558
dancing around down there.

611
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:08,294
Oh, my God, the death laser
is attacking your legs.

612
00:28:08,362 --> 00:28:09,996
You're gonna die.

613
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:11,764
We're wasting time
looking for cancer.

614
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:13,066
She's still walking around.

615
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,467
She's still pretty healthy.

616
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:15,869
Maybe it's something minor.

617
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:17,937
Maybe we're
not wasting time.

618
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:20,607
We wouldn't have seen
a flat lesion.

619
00:28:20,674 --> 00:28:24,544
Skin cancer could have
metastasized to the intestines.

620
00:28:24,612 --> 00:28:26,412
Cool.

621
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,814
Check for melanomas.

622
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:48,535
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

623
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,236
Come here.

624
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,304
Here, kitty.

625
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:09,055
What?
- It's not cancer.

626
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,024
We found spider veins
on her back.

627
00:29:11,091 --> 00:29:12,992
They weren't there
when she came in.

628
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,761
Spider veins
means Cushing's.

629
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:17,163
Could cause
an abdominal disturbance,

630
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:18,398
brown urine--

631
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,167
But the bronchospasm?

632
00:29:21,235 --> 00:29:24,070
Cushing's myopathy.

633
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:27,273
It's uncommon but--

634
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:28,975
Wait a second.

635
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:30,443
You didn't wake me up
to tell me a symptom

636
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:32,178
that's not killing her.

637
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:34,213
What else is going on?

638
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:35,782
I think she's dying.

639
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:38,184
I just told you
it's Cushing's.

640
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:40,286
I don't mean
because of the spider veins.

641
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:41,821
Mr. Limpert died.

642
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:43,590
If that's
my high school gym teacher--

643
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,358
It's your coma patient.

644
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:46,893
He was stable
for a year and a half,

645
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:48,127
and he just died.

646
00:29:48,195 --> 00:29:50,363
The cat was right, House.

647
00:29:56,315 --> 00:29:57,382
Here, puss, puss, puss,
puss, puss.

648
00:29:57,449 --> 00:29:58,983
Say "puss" one more time.

649
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:00,385
It's the sixth "puss"
that really does it.

650
00:30:00,452 --> 00:30:02,020
You're right.

651
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:04,155
Sulking will solve everything.

652
00:30:04,223 --> 00:30:06,858
That cat sat on my lap,
and that cat knows something.

653
00:30:06,925 --> 00:30:08,159
You believe it now?

654
00:30:08,227 --> 00:30:09,961
Yesterday it was
all a coincidence.

655
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:11,195
Yesterday it was

656
00:30:11,263 --> 00:30:12,597
until I unintentionally
proved it wasn't.

657
00:30:12,664 --> 00:30:14,799
Patient
must have Cushing's.

658
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:16,501
We have to figure out
whether it's--

659
00:30:16,568 --> 00:30:18,136
Cat's nose is powerful.

660
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:19,804
It could smell liver
or kidney failure.

661
00:30:19,872 --> 00:30:21,873
Exactly, except
if you'd glanced

662
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,941
at the nursing home files
I had faxed over this morning,

663
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:25,410
you'd know that most
of the patients'

664
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:27,211
livers and kidneys were fine;
what else?

665
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,946
MRIs aren't telling us
if the Cushing's

666
00:30:29,014 --> 00:30:30,314
in her adrenals
or her brain.

667
00:30:30,382 --> 00:30:31,816
So check her A.C.T.H.

668
00:30:31,884 --> 00:30:33,551
A cat's vision is at
the blue end of the spectrum.

669
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:35,119
A.C.T.H. is 11.7.

670
00:30:35,187 --> 00:30:36,287
It's too close to tell.

671
00:30:36,355 --> 00:30:37,555
We can't treat
the wrong organ

672
00:30:37,623 --> 00:30:38,923
'cause that won't solve
anything.

673
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:41,059
She could have a cortisol storm,
could kill her.

674
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:42,660
Well, maybe
as the senior fellow

675
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:44,462
you could have made sure
that my doors were closed,

676
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,364
so that I could be
concentrating on the cat

677
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:47,999
instead of looking
for the cat.

678
00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:51,269
You all right?

679
00:30:54,006 --> 00:30:54,839
Your nose.

680
00:31:03,415 --> 00:31:04,315
What'd he say?

681
00:31:04,383 --> 00:31:05,616
Sounds like he said,

682
00:31:05,684 --> 00:31:09,520
"Do you like
cranberry juice?"

683
00:31:09,588 --> 00:31:10,621
Crap.

684
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:12,190
Cheaper than fake blood.

685
00:31:12,257 --> 00:31:14,125
And more cran-tastic.

686
00:31:14,193 --> 00:31:16,661
Don't ever leave my door
open like that again.

687
00:31:16,728 --> 00:31:19,030
You're playing pranks,
and this woman could be dying.

688
00:31:19,098 --> 00:31:20,465
So have chase
do a venous sampling

689
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:21,999
in her brain.

690
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:23,835
If he finds something,
it's there.

691
00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:26,704
If he finds nothing,
it's the adrenals.

692
00:31:30,242 --> 00:31:33,544
I'm not who I used to be.

693
00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:35,847
I'm scared.

694
00:31:35,914 --> 00:31:38,916
That's not a way to live.

695
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:40,718
I want to come work for you.

696
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:45,456
Jeez, Chris,
you didn't think--

697
00:31:45,524 --> 00:31:49,227
I didn't mean to imply
that I could hire you right now.

698
00:31:49,294 --> 00:31:51,295
You said you needed
guys like me.

699
00:31:51,363 --> 00:31:54,499
I know, but you don't
have an MBA.

700
00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:57,201
And I just hired
a Chief Medical Officer.

701
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:59,470
Let me invest in that
laser scalpel start-up.

702
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:01,706
I got money saved.
Not a ton but--

703
00:32:01,773 --> 00:32:03,241
We put in
a $2 million minimum

704
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:04,509
for the first round
financing.

705
00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:12,416
Look, I guess I could take
you on at a smaller number.

706
00:32:12,484 --> 00:32:14,152
But you have to understand,

707
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:16,521
it wouldn't be
some quick payoff.

708
00:32:16,588 --> 00:32:19,290
I know, I know it's not
gonna change my life overnight.

709
00:32:19,358 --> 00:32:23,161
I just need
to start changing it.

710
00:32:25,397 --> 00:32:26,697
Okay, then let's start.

711
00:32:31,303 --> 00:32:33,004
What exactly
are you hoping to find

712
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:34,839
inside your dead coma guy?

713
00:32:34,907 --> 00:32:37,074
Catnip.
Chew toy.

714
00:32:37,142 --> 00:32:39,010
I don't know.
That's why I'm looking.

715
00:32:39,077 --> 00:32:41,412
Your patient
had cardiac arrest

716
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,314
during the venous sampling.

717
00:32:43,382 --> 00:32:45,650
We got her back,
but her heart's still tenuous.

718
00:32:45,717 --> 00:32:47,118
That tell us anything?

719
00:32:47,186 --> 00:32:48,619
She's weak,
possibly dying.

720
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:51,122
So nothing.
What about the A.C.T.H.?

721
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,657
Slightly elevated.

722
00:32:52,724 --> 00:32:55,092
That confirms the Cushing's
is in the brain--go.

723
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,361
Are you sure
that it's Cushing's?

724
00:32:57,429 --> 00:32:58,829
You'd expect
central body obesity.

725
00:32:58,897 --> 00:33:00,198
She's in good shape.

726
00:33:00,265 --> 00:33:01,766
If it had
a normal presentation,

727
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:02,900
there wouldn't be
a cat involved.

728
00:33:02,968 --> 00:33:04,402
So it's the brain.

729
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:05,803
That means the next question
is whether to remove

730
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:06,971
the pituitary right now--

731
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,606
That's not
a question for me.

732
00:33:08,674 --> 00:33:10,575
That's a question
for the patient.

733
00:33:10,642 --> 00:33:12,476
You'll present both sides
and let her decide.

734
00:33:12,544 --> 00:33:14,312
All right.

735
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:19,617
I've gotta stop
telling you my theories.

736
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:21,185
You always just try
to prove me wrong.

737
00:33:21,253 --> 00:33:22,954
You mean the theory
about Cuddy's ass

738
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:24,155
getting bigger
at the full moon?

739
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:25,823
I confirmed that one.

740
00:33:25,891 --> 00:33:27,491
Photo's on my blog.

741
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:28,759
Normally, you'd be
up in the patient room

742
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:30,061
hectoring her on what to do.

743
00:33:30,128 --> 00:33:31,495
Instead you're
up to your elbows

744
00:33:31,563 --> 00:33:33,564
in some irrelevant dead guy
who may or may not be

745
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:35,366
connected to a magic cat

746
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:38,069
because you want to prove
to me that you don't care.

747
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:39,737
Case is over.

748
00:33:39,805 --> 00:33:41,639
I'm exploring
a scientific mystery.

749
00:33:41,707 --> 00:33:43,941
I put up
with your obsessions.

750
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:46,544
I even encourage them,
for one reason--

751
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:47,979
They save lives.

752
00:33:48,046 --> 00:33:50,114
I don't know
what you're doing now.

753
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,423
Cushing's
means your body's

754
00:33:59,491 --> 00:34:01,626
overproducing a hormone
called cortisol.

755
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:03,294
The recommended
course of action

756
00:34:03,362 --> 00:34:04,795
is to suppress it with drugs.

757
00:34:04,863 --> 00:34:06,864
And that will cure it?

758
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:08,599
Just treat it.

759
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:09,767
It could come back.

760
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:12,470
The only permanent solution

761
00:34:12,537 --> 00:34:15,306
is to cut into your brain
and remove your pituitary gland,

762
00:34:15,374 --> 00:34:17,308
but the surgery's dangerous.

763
00:34:17,376 --> 00:34:21,078
Your heart stopped on the table
once already.

764
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:23,214
I want the surgery.

765
00:34:23,282 --> 00:34:27,151
This thing is gonna kill me
if I don't kill it first.

766
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:32,423
Because of the cat?

767
00:34:32,491 --> 00:34:35,593
Do you want to tell me
what an idiot I'm being?

768
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:38,296
No.

769
00:34:38,363 --> 00:34:40,531
I really believe
that there are things

770
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,466
that science can't understand,

771
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:45,636
that there is a role
for faith and prayer,

772
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:48,706
but it's in the waiting room,

773
00:34:48,774 --> 00:34:50,408
not the O.R.

774
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:57,081
There's a reason
I got sick.

775
00:34:57,149 --> 00:34:58,983
There's a reason
for all the bad things

776
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:00,418
that have happened to me.

777
00:35:00,485 --> 00:35:02,687
I don't know
what that reason is,

778
00:35:02,754 --> 00:35:06,190
but I know that
if there isn't one,

779
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:10,261
if there's no greater
purpose in the world,

780
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:13,331
then it's not a world
I want to live in.

781
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:17,902
I'll schedule
an operating room.

782
00:35:40,176 --> 00:35:42,644
Early.

783
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:45,380
I'm not staying long.
I'm quitting.

784
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:50,052
You got a new job?

785
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,787
No.

786
00:35:51,855 --> 00:35:53,622
Well, then you're
not quitting.

787
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,124
See you back here tomorrow.

788
00:35:55,191 --> 00:35:59,061
You're not accepting
my resignation?

789
00:35:59,129 --> 00:36:00,496
Easier this way.

790
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:02,197
It voids the whole thing
where you panic,

791
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:03,999
run back and grovel,
and I punish you

792
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:06,068
and then take you back.

793
00:36:08,938 --> 00:36:10,806
Bye.

794
00:36:13,777 --> 00:36:15,477
Bring donuts.

795
00:36:15,545 --> 00:36:17,079
Everyone loves
those bear claws.

796
00:36:55,985 --> 00:36:58,620
Here, puss, puss, puss,
puss, puss.

797
00:36:58,688 --> 00:36:59,755
Puss?

798
00:37:44,934 --> 00:37:46,768
Mr. Taub.

799
00:37:46,836 --> 00:37:49,071
I've been waiting 15 minutes.
Where's Neil?

800
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:50,839
Neil doesn't
work here anymore.

801
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:52,841
He's the CEO.

802
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:55,310
I'm sorry.
I wish I could help you.

803
00:37:55,378 --> 00:37:57,079
Sorry.

804
00:37:57,146 --> 00:37:58,380
This is crazy.

805
00:37:58,448 --> 00:38:00,349
I'm investing
with his company.

806
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,984
He doesn't have
a company.

807
00:38:02,051 --> 00:38:05,354
He worked here, but he was
a receptionist, a temp.

808
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:07,322
Where is he?
- He's in custody.

809
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,124
I really am not supposed
to say anything else.

810
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:11,126
I went to high school
with him.

811
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:13,695
That's what
everyone else thought too.

812
00:38:13,763 --> 00:38:17,933
I'm guessing you also
cured his ear problem.

813
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:19,668
Did you give him
the money yet?

814
00:38:19,736 --> 00:38:22,070
No.

815
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,715
I was right.

816
00:38:33,783 --> 00:38:37,252
And more satisfyingly,
you were wrong.

817
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,421
It was a coincidence.

818
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:42,024
The cat was
not predicting deaths.

819
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:43,659
It was just trying
to keep warm.

820
00:38:43,726 --> 00:38:44,860
Yes, dead people

821
00:38:44,928 --> 00:38:46,929
are renowned
for their warm glow.

822
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:48,630
They are
if they're feverish,

823
00:38:48,698 --> 00:38:50,732
like three
of the patients were.

824
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,602
Or if they're wasting away,
like the other eight.

825
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,771
Wasting doesn't--
- Yeah, it does.

826
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:57,973
If it means someone sticks
a heating blanket on you.

827
00:39:00,743 --> 00:39:02,110
Congrats.

828
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:03,845
Because of your crazy
obsession with this cat,

829
00:39:03,913 --> 00:39:06,281
you've solved
a completely trivial mystery.

830
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:08,016
Completely trivial?

831
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:09,418
My God.

832
00:39:09,485 --> 00:39:12,020
It's clearly
only partially trivial.

833
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:14,156
Debbie climbed on Morgan too,

834
00:39:14,223 --> 00:39:15,891
which means
she was overheated.

835
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:18,493
So what causes flushing and
mimics every Cushing's symptom

836
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:22,464
except central body obesity?

837
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:24,666
Cancer.

838
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:26,702
A corticotropin-producing
carcinoid tumor

839
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:28,270
of the intestine.

840
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:30,572
But your pillcam
didn't find anything.

841
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,776
Means it must be somewhere
the pillcam couldn't go.

842
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:36,211
The appendix.

843
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:39,181
Congratulations,
you probably saved her life.

844
00:39:39,248 --> 00:39:43,518
You definitely saved
her needless surgery.

845
00:39:43,586 --> 00:39:45,120
Yes, I did.

846
00:39:45,188 --> 00:39:47,889
What's the O.R.
extension number?

847
00:39:47,957 --> 00:39:49,624
Just curious.

848
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:01,837
Thank you.

849
00:40:01,904 --> 00:40:04,072
I wouldn't come here
for thanks.

850
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,075
That would be ungracious.

851
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:08,677
It's more about gloating.

852
00:40:08,745 --> 00:40:12,314
You were about to cut out
a piece of your brain

853
00:40:12,382 --> 00:40:16,351
just to chase
some crazy superstition.

854
00:40:16,419 --> 00:40:18,387
But I didn't.

855
00:40:18,454 --> 00:40:20,155
You "didn't"
didn't do anything.

856
00:40:20,223 --> 00:40:22,090
I stopped it.

857
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:24,226
And what made you do that?

858
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:27,329
Science, logic, reason.

859
00:40:27,397 --> 00:40:28,730
Pick any three.

860
00:40:28,798 --> 00:40:31,233
A cat chooses
that exact moment

861
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,368
to sit on your computer.

862
00:40:33,436 --> 00:40:35,804
Maybe that's
science and logic and reason

863
00:40:35,872 --> 00:40:37,639
or maybe it's something else.

864
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:42,377
You're an idiot.

865
00:40:46,282 --> 00:40:50,152
I looked up the preacher
from New York state.

866
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:52,721
His followers
never faded out.

867
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:55,090
They became
the Seventh-Day Adventists,

868
00:40:55,158 --> 00:40:56,758
a major religion.

869
00:40:56,826 --> 00:40:58,693
That man changed
the course of history.

870
00:40:58,761 --> 00:41:01,930
Because his followers
were as deluded as he was.

871
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:07,969
Maybe he just gave them
something to live for.

872
00:41:11,707 --> 00:41:13,575
Feel better.

873
00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:49,978
Kutner!

874
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,454
Cat pee on my chair?

875
00:41:59,522 --> 00:42:00,722
Blood on my face?

876
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,057
Fake blood.

877
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:08,396
You pay for the dry cleaning.

878
00:42:16,305 --> 00:42:17,739
Why are you still alive?

879
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:19,541
I'm not sure.

880
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:21,843
I guess he was impressed
you stood up to him.

881
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:25,213
And got a cat
to pee on his chair.

882
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:26,948
Yeah.
A cat.

883
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:35,490
# black night down heavy
on my weary brow #

884
00:42:37,727 --> 00:42:39,861
See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

885
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:42,931
# light shining
in the pouring rain #

886
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:48,336
# can see somehow cold comfort
in the broken tree #

887
00:42:48,404 --> 00:42:54,142
# but I won't let it
bring me to my knees #

888
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,712
# I'm not flying #

889
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,149
# but I'm not drowning now #

890
00:43:01,217 --> 00:43:06,021
# clouds are breaking #
