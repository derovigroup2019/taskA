1
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:36,232
- 145 pounds!

2
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,007
Johnson!
Miller!

3
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,204
- Aaaah!

4
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,187
- Aaaaah!

5
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:16,299
- House.

6
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:19,936
House.

7
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:24,340
I know you're not asleep.

8
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:27,544
- That insight
would be a lot more impressive

9
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:32,115
if you weren't just a product
of my exhausted brain.

10
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:35,285
- Aren't you curious
about why I'm here?

11
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:41,591
- curious why
no french maid's outfit.

12
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,460
No spanky pants.

13
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:46,763
- I'm a hallucination...
not a fantasy.

14
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:50,200
- It's insomnia.

15
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,502
Four nights without REM sleep
can cause--

16
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,537
- That might explain
why you're hallucinating.

17
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:56,139
Doesn't explain
why you're hallucinating

18
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:58,174
Wilson's dead girlfriend.

19
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:01,144
- Probably just my secret
and very unconscious desire

20
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:02,512
to get Wilson into my bedroom.

21
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,614
- Or maybe your guilt
of Kutner's suicide

22
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:07,050
reminds you how guilty
you felt about me.

23
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:10,820
- Who cares why you're here?

24
00:03:10,888 --> 00:03:12,822
A decent night's sleep,
you won't be.

25
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:25,068
- Guess I'll be around
a few more hours.

26
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:36,746
- Need some coffee?

27
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:38,581
- Addictive substances
are no substitute

28
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:40,350
for nature's healing balm.

29
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:43,152
Let's make this fast.
I need to sleep.

30
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,089
- Deaf 14-year-old started
hearing imaginary explosions.

31
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:50,126
- Exploding head syndrome.

32
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,728
Cool.

33
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:53,696
Well, obviously his brain
knows how to hear.

34
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:55,265
- Patient went deaf
at age four.

35
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:56,533
Complication of meningitis.

36
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,002
- So why no cochlear implant?

37
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,004
- Usual suspects are insomnia,

38
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:03,239
which he doesn't have,
migraines, which he doesn't get,

39
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:05,475
and head trauma
which didn't show up on the CT.

40
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:09,145
- Damn imaginary pen.

41
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:11,347
- Mom's signature's
on everything.

42
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:12,615
Did the dad die?

43
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:14,183
- No, I doubt it.
He was a sperm donor.

44
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:16,085
Medical records
couldn't be cleaner.

45
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:17,387
- So we're left with
temporal lobe seizure.

46
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:18,621
- Wrong.

47
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:19,789
- Someone
at the wrestling meet

48
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:21,524
would have noticed
a seizure.

49
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:23,059
- Could have just looked like
a bad shot to the leg.

50
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:24,460
Put him in the seizure lab.

51
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:27,163
See if his head blows up
all over again.

52
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:29,899
- You're gonna ignore
your own subconscious?

53
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:31,568
Gonna be the limp
leading the blind.

54
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:44,714
I need a 'scrip,
for sleeping pills.

55
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:47,150
My neighbor's dog's
been keeping me awake,

56
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:48,851
and seems strangely
invulnerable to poison.

57
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,823
Why is the soon-to-be-
second-prettiest Dr. Chase here?

58
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:55,858
- I'll take that
as a congratulations.

59
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:57,694
- We're discussing a case.

60
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:01,297
- Why did he
close that file?

61
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:02,999
- Wedding in two weeks?

62
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:04,400
I'd say you were pregnant,

63
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:06,469
but I don't think Chase's body
is mature enough

64
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:07,704
to produce sperm.

65
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:10,974
- It's a small ceremony.
Why wait?

66
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,008
- Nighty night.

67
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:13,910
- Drugs with no lecture?

68
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:15,244
He wants you out.

69
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:20,016
- Interesting case?

70
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:21,851
- Possible prostate cancer
came into the E.R.

71
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,952
- Pencil cup.

72
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:31,227
- Oh!

73
00:05:31,295 --> 00:05:32,595
No wonder
his prostate's enlarged.

74
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:35,565
It's full of pool cues
and cigars.

75
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:36,833
- Chase's best man
doesn't get here

76
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,201
till the day of the wedding,

77
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:40,370
so I asked Wilson to throw
his bachelor party.

78
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:42,805
- No retired ministers
available to plan it?

79
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:45,308
- Chase doesn't want some big,
raucous party.

80
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:46,809
- So she says.

81
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:48,978
- Luckily,
there are people in this world

82
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,813
ready to stand up
for what's right.

83
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:52,949
- No, no, no, I don't want--
I don't want you to--

84
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:55,051
- Listen, two things
I do well.

85
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:59,288
Bachelor parties rank
towards the top.

86
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:00,923
- I get to help, right?

87
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:11,300
- Starting five hertz.

88
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:13,436
House made it through
that entire differential

89
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:14,837
without mocking our patient

90
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:17,106
for not having
a cochlear implant.

91
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:19,075
- The patient
doesn't want an implant

92
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:20,476
because he's comfortable
with who he is.

93
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:21,844
It's admirable.

94
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:23,413
- He's deaf.

95
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,481
It's not an identity,
it's a disability.

96
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:27,150
- It's also a culture.

97
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:29,285
The deaf have their own schools,
their own language.

98
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,721
Still no spiking.

99
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,691
- Going to 20.

100
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:37,326
Anything I can simulate
with a $3.00 pair of ear plugs

101
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,328
is not a culture.

102
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:41,364
No sign of seizure.

103
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:43,132
Temporal lobe activity
is still clean.

104
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,935
- Doctors...doctors,
he can't see.

105
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:47,904
One of his eyes.

106
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:51,074
- The limp leading the blind.

107
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:54,444
- Is that supposed
to mean something?

108
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:56,345
- I didn't think so.

109
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:59,182
- So exploding head syndrome,
plus vision loss.

110
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,717
- Subclavian steal syndrome.

111
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:03,186
Vascular defect coupled
with constant arm movement

112
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:04,754
could siphon blood flow
from the brain.

113
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:06,322
- We should do an angio,
check his--

114
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,890
- Knock yourselves out.

115
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,334
- How did I know
he was gonna go blind?

116
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:22,538
Don't get cute, gazoo.

117
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:24,474
You're in my mind.
You're obviously there.

118
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,976
- C-reactive protein.

119
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:29,245
I noticed in his file
it was slightly elevated.

120
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:30,780
I figured the stress
of the seizure lab

121
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:33,182
would drive
inflammation even higher,

122
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,384
lead to optic neuritis.

123
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:38,187
- That's a lot clearer than
"the limp leading the blind."

124
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:40,656
- It was just a glimmer.
I couldn't put it into words.

125
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:42,992
- It was a long shot.

126
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,695
I don't even remember
the C-reactive protein level.

127
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:47,897
- Obviously you do.

128
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:48,998
You just don't know it.

129
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,335
- How high is K2?

130
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:54,003
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

131
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,105
But I read a book about it
years ago.

132
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:59,375
Fierce, sexy sherpa
on the cover, bending over--

133
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:01,944
- 28,251 feet.

134
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:05,181
- Cool.

135
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:07,650
An all-access pass
to my own brain.

136
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:10,887
- Go play the kid
some music.

137
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:13,356
- Why?

138
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:16,459
- Another long shot.

139
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,094
- We're using iodine dye
to track blood flow

140
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:21,030
in your neck and arm.

141
00:08:24,902 --> 00:08:27,570
# fight the power #

142
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:29,539
# fight the power #

143
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:32,108
# fight the power #

144
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:33,743
# fight the power #

145
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:36,546
# fight the power #

146
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:37,880
# fight the power #

147
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:39,715
# fight the power #

148
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:44,854
# we've got to
fight the powers that be... #

149
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:46,556
House, what are you doing?

150
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:49,058
- What does it
look like I'm doing?

151
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:50,827
Fighting the power.

152
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:01,771
Feel that?

153
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,307
How cool is that?

154
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:08,611
Apparently your mom doesn't
care what you're missing.

155
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,679
- You're an ass.

156
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:14,116
- He says he feels
the vibrations in his abdomen,

157
00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:15,117
but not his hands.

158
00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:16,986
What does that mean?

159
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,227
- It's a new symptom.

160
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:25,828
Neuropathy.

161
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:38,074
- Thought you were gonna
get some sleep.

162
00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:40,176
- Case got interesting.

163
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:53,308
- Like the zoo.

164
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,343
Except you can bang on the glass
as much as you want.

165
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,078
- How did you know
about the neuropathy?

166
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:58,413
- Good question.

167
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,847
- Enough with the riddles.

168
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:02,717
- Tell me about it.

169
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:05,153
- Think "wrestling record."

170
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,489
- Juggling.

171
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:09,724
No, pins.

172
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,125
Three pins.

173
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,695
Patient was pinned
in his last three matches.

174
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:15,964
Leading up to that,
he was 15 and 0.

175
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:19,267
I figured his balance was off
from diminished sensation.

176
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:22,103
- Could be increased ICP
from a brain tumor.

177
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:23,237
- That we missed
on the head CT?

178
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:24,906
- Cutting weight
for wrestling

179
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:26,808
could have led
to rhabdomyolysis.

180
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,844
- He just went up
a weight class three months ago.

181
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:33,348
- Foreman's right.

182
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:37,552
- Actually, increased ICP
could make sense.

183
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:38,753
- You just said--

184
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:39,821
- I was processing.

185
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:48,763
- It also puts a new symptom
on the table.

186
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,498
- His deafness.

187
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,301
What if it was caused
by NF2 cancer

188
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:55,069
instead of his
childhood meningitis?

189
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,738
- So meningitis
was a coincidence?

190
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:59,941
- Or a byproduct of the cancer
suppressing his immune system.

191
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,542
MRI his head.

192
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,178
- If you're right about NF2,
his deafness may be reversible.

193
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,815
I'll set it up
and talk to the patient.

194
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:11,085
- You two...doing anything?

195
00:11:23,665 --> 00:11:26,334
- You know what
a broken cowboy is?

196
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:29,170
It was on House's
list of requirements.

197
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:32,407
- I have three theories.

198
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:35,209
- Why is House so into
this bachelor party thing?

199
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,211
- He needs to have a reason
to be into a bachelor party?

200
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,746
- He needs a reason
to be into anything.

201
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:41,883
- Give me your wallet.

202
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,186
- House could be trying
to tempt Chase into cheating.

203
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:46,387
Break them up.

204
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,056
- You think House
is into Cameron?

205
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,725
- I think House is into Cameron
being into him.

206
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,428
Marrying Chase
would shatter that fantasy.

207
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:55,329
- If Chase cheats,

208
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:56,798
then they shouldn't be getting
married in the first place.

209
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:58,332
- So you're okay with House

210
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,768
getting Chase smashed enough
to make a stupid mistake?

211
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,537
- Being drunk doesn't
change who you are.

212
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:03,838
It just reveals it.

213
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,045
- You think she can do
the broken cowboy?

214
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,181
- God, I hope so.

215
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:15,850
- NF2 is an extremely
slow-growing cancer,

216
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:17,685
which makes it very treatable.

217
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,787
If we're right,
taking out the tumor

218
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:23,558
means there's a chance
you'll regain your hearing.

219
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,664
- No.

220
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:31,365
He said you have to.

221
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,969
- What's wrong?

222
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:37,205
- He wants you to treat
the cancer, but leave him deaf.

223
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:39,006
- Uh, sorry.

224
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:40,575
Doesn't work like that.

225
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,807
- Imaging shows
slightly elevated ICP,

226
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,876
but no masses
on or around the nerves.

227
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:17,044
It's not cancer.

228
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:19,480
- Slight bowing in the wall
of the fourth ventricle.

229
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,648
Could still indicate a tumor.

230
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,083
- We brought pictures.

231
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,885
- The fact that you sent me
on a scouting mission--

232
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:25,586
- No skirts.

233
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:28,089
- You're not on the guest list.

234
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:31,526
Bachelor parties are an ancient
and sacred male rite of passage.

235
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:33,261
- The ventricle bowing
is most likely

236
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:34,729
a pre-existing
anatomical anomaly,

237
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:37,265
not the indication of a tumor.

238
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:39,267
- No way to know for sure
without a brain biopsy.

239
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:40,835
If I get drunk enough,
there's a chance

240
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,603
I might make out
with one of the strippers.

241
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,338
Or become one.

242
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,373
Sold.

243
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,208
- We can't just drill

244
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:49,443
into our patient's brain
on a hunch.

245
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:52,280
Oh, God, not her.

246
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,682
She's the one that got me
hooked in with Madoff.

247
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,284
- Taub's right.
It's not cancer.

248
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,985
- Yeah, by all means,

249
00:13:58,053 --> 00:13:59,153
abandon a great
diagnostic theory

250
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:00,655
because it's difficult
to prove.

251
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:02,557
Do a biopsy.

252
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,425
We need to take a better look
at his fourth ventricle.

253
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:05,993
- Or an older look.

254
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:07,895
- The mom's never
gonna let us touch his brain

255
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:09,397
without some evidence.

256
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:10,698
- Patient broke his nose
years ago.

257
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,234
Hospital could have
done an MRI.

258
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:14,869
Okay.

259
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,842
- The main reason
my third wife and I eloped

260
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,145
was to avoid
House's bachelor party.

261
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:30,885
Have you seen <i>Caligula?</i>

262
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:37,558
- My patient's brain now...

263
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,327
versus three years ago.

264
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:40,328
See any difference?

265
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:44,432
Is he telling you
to avoid the party?

266
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:46,400
- I took an oath
to do no harm.

267
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,469
- Sure, don't come.

268
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:52,173
If you want your wedding vows
to be meaningless.

269
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:54,742
- This should be interesting.

270
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,644
- You are going to commit

271
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,746
to that one special woman
forever,

272
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,214
which is beautiful.

273
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:02,350
But if your commitment
the day after the wedding

274
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:03,951
is the same as your commitment
the day before,

275
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,886
then the wedding
meant nothing.

276
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:08,623
So, and I see
no logical way around this,

277
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,691
if you want
your marriage to matter,

278
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,426
you have to be a wanton,
trolling,

279
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,128
muck-covered pig
the day before.

280
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,797
- You're evil.

281
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:18,232
See ya.

282
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,234
- The wall of the fourth
ventricle changed.

283
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:22,270
It isn't bowed
in the older scan.

284
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,972
- Evidence of NF2, right?

285
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,308
- You'd need to do
a brain biopsy to confirm.

286
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:35,149
Uh, I'm not going
to the bachelor party.

287
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:37,418
Every time I go
to one of your parties,

288
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:41,856
I end up embarrassing myself
in some new and unexpected way.

289
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:44,859
- That whole thing with
the duck was hardly unexpected.

290
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:46,527
- I'm not going.

291
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,663
- Okay.

292
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,231
- It's not okay.

293
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:58,439
Do you know who we need?

294
00:15:58,507 --> 00:16:00,741
That stripper you got
for Wilson's bachelor party.

295
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:02,143
You could do body shots
right off her.

296
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,745
- Why go back to that well?

297
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,714
In the nine years
since Wilson's party,

298
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:08,616
a whole new generation
of hot girls

299
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,651
have been abused
by their stepfathers.

300
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,987
- She loved cats.

301
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,223
- What made you remember
the stripper loved cats?

302
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,060
- Chase has a cat.

303
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:20,161
They'll bond.

304
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:22,096
Ahem, House?

305
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:24,632
You, uh, entertaining yourself
up there?

306
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:30,204
- Just rehearsing
for the revival of <i>Evita.</i>

307
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:31,439
What'd you find?

308
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:33,140
- The biopsy shows
nerve inflammation

309
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,443
consistent with increased
intracranial pressure.

310
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,545
Something's wrong,
but it's not cancer.

311
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:42,983
- He's gonna
go through life deaf.

312
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:44,685
- He's okay with that.

313
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,554
- He has no idea
what he's missing.

314
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:49,023
His mom's a moron.

315
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,491
He's gonna
pay for her stupidity

316
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,659
for the rest of his life?

317
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:54,995
Are <i>we</i> okay with that?

318
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,103
- Why are you closing?

319
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,004
Let's put in
a cochlear implant.

320
00:17:04,072 --> 00:17:06,607
- That wasn't in the paperwork.

321
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,676
- Really? Well, someone
must have screwed up.

322
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:09,777
I'll go track it down.

323
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:11,645
- I'll wait.

324
00:17:11,713 --> 00:17:12,980
- That's a great idea.

325
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:14,648
Let the kid spend more time
under anesthesia

326
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:16,050
with his skull cracked open.

327
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,785
- I'll wait.

328
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:21,622
- I have been known to lie
to serve my own agenda.

329
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,126
An implant does absolutely
nothing to help me diagnose him.

330
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,765
- Let's get an implant tray
in here.

331
00:17:58,214 --> 00:17:59,848
- Just--
just try to relax.

332
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,917
- Just during
the recovery phase...

333
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:12,227
- Her son didn't want
the implant.

334
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:14,229
- If he still doesn't want it
after having time to adjust,

335
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:15,263
I'll take it out.

336
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,831
I'll blind him too,

337
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:18,266
if he wants to experience
that culture.

338
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:19,801
Remove it <i>now.</i>

339
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,769
- Kid's just had brain surgery.

340
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:22,770
He's not stable.

341
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:25,840
- Ms. Miller,

342
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:27,976
I'm not trying to minimize
Dr. House's wrongdoing.

343
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:30,044
But the best thing...
- Why is she sitting?

344
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:33,848
She's not yelling,
not threatening, not pacing.

345
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,650
Just sitting.

346
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:39,120
- Understand, Dr. House?

347
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:40,388
House!

348
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:42,457
Focus.

349
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:43,992
I need you to say
you accept the arrangement.

350
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,494
- No problem.

351
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:49,297
You're not mad.

352
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:50,498
- I'm mad.

353
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,333
- Not mad enough.

354
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:54,602
You wanted your son to hear.

355
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,538
You just didn't have the guts
to make him get the implant.

356
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:59,073
- Once my son is stable,

357
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:00,875
I want that thing
out of his head.

358
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:11,252
- Why did you do this?

359
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,221
- Because he is ignorant,

360
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:14,589
and he's being raised
by an idiot.

361
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:16,724
- Not good enough.

362
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,159
You always have--

363
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:20,795
- My patient is opting
into a handicap!

364
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:25,533
It's an insult to all the other
gimps out there.

365
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:26,968
- Okay.

366
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:32,040
But I'm still putting Foreman
in charge of the case.

367
00:19:32,107 --> 00:19:33,608
- That's the arrangement?

368
00:19:36,912 --> 00:19:38,313
- Okay.

369
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,289
- You're okay
with Foreman in charge?

370
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:49,924
Who you calling?

371
00:19:49,992 --> 00:19:52,060
Oh...right, you don't want
to look like a lunatic.

372
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:54,462
- Yeah, about that...

373
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,964
- You think we did
the wrong thing?

374
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,099
- I'm not sure.

375
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,934
I'm not even sure
why we did it.

376
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:01,603
- Well, that argument
you made to Cuddy

377
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,870
sounded pretty good.

378
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:04,639
- To you, maybe.

379
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,580
- Huh.

380
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:13,781
I figured by now
you'd be at the board

381
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,984
in your monocle
and jodhpurs.

382
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:17,218
- Yeah, you did
something stupid.

383
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:18,253
Quick, better mock someone.

384
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,321
- Why did you do it?

385
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:22,490
- Why did I give a human being
the power of hearing?

386
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,526
You ask God the same question,
he'll give you the same answer.

387
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:29,163
- Patient has a fever now too.

388
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:30,698
- Probably just a post-op
complication.

389
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:31,966
Arnold-Chiari?

390
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:32,967
- Not without muscle weakness.

391
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:34,435
- Pseudotumor cerebri?

392
00:20:34,503 --> 00:20:36,037
- We checked his eyes
before the surgery.

393
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:37,205
No papilledema.

394
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:39,774
- Candy?

395
00:20:39,842 --> 00:20:41,342
I'm pretty sure
Wilson's stripper's name

396
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,777
was something sweet.

397
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:45,747
- Maybe his fever is more than
the post-op reaction.

398
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:47,415
His girlfriend
was sick a few months ago.

399
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:49,350
Maybe her flu
was really Epstein-Barr.

400
00:20:49,418 --> 00:20:50,718
- Lolli?

401
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:51,919
- They swap spit,
virus travels to his brain,

402
00:20:51,987 --> 00:20:53,221
leads to meningitis,

403
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,355
leads to increased
intracranial pressure.

404
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:56,624
- I agree. Taffy?

405
00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:57,525
- I agree.

406
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:02,196
- Go ahead, start him
on rivavirin for Epstein-Barr.

407
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:04,198
- Keep making
decisions like that.

408
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:06,934
It really bolsters the illusion
that you're in charge.

409
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:12,640
- Why aren't you
in my office?

410
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:16,311
- Because I know
what the word "my" means.

411
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:18,046
- I did something insane,

412
00:21:18,113 --> 00:21:21,649
and you're not all over me
analyzing why.

413
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:24,052
- It was nice.

414
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:27,822
- I gave that idiot an implant

415
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,157
to prove to him
what an idiot he's been.

416
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:30,458
How is that nice?

417
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:31,893
- You didn't do it
to solve the case.

418
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,261
You didn't do it
to save his life.

419
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:35,663
You...did it
to make his life better.

420
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:36,931
It was a caring act.

421
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:38,700
Which you did in a way
that was...

422
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:41,769
immoral and illegal, but...

423
00:21:41,837 --> 00:21:43,037
baby steps.

424
00:21:43,105 --> 00:21:45,173
- Doesn't sound like us.

425
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,209
- You can't make me go
to the bachelor party.

426
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:49,744
- I know.

427
00:21:49,812 --> 00:21:51,512
- And you're okay with that?

428
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,581
- What choice do I have?

429
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,330
Seth!

430
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:14,235
Please, God.

431
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:20,942
"Seth"?

432
00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:27,315
Yes.

433
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:34,655
Seth.

434
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:02,850
Oh.

435
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:06,187
I think he just
wet the bed.

436
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:30,170
- The kid's dehydrated,
but stable.

437
00:23:30,237 --> 00:23:31,905
Thankfully,
the fountain of whiz

438
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:34,707
seems to have stopped
for the moment.

439
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:37,710
- Not before hosing
Epstein-Barr off the table.

440
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:39,379
Now eat up.

441
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:41,247
We're gonna pick out
the ice cream flavors

442
00:23:41,315 --> 00:23:43,283
for the bachelor party.

443
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,953
- Could be systemic
autoimmune disease.

444
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:48,788
Sarcoido--

445
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:51,524
This tastes like...Vodka.

446
00:23:51,592 --> 00:23:53,660
- Well, it'd be stupid
if it tasted like bourbon.

447
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:54,661
That's the brown one.

448
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:55,929
- It is vodka?

449
00:23:55,996 --> 00:23:59,532
- Flash frozen
in a secret process.

450
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,100
Guy figured it out
in his basement.

451
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,338
Lemoncello.

452
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:06,806
Genius.

453
00:24:06,874 --> 00:24:08,875
- Symptoms came on
too hard and too fast.

454
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:10,376
Sarcoidosis is progressive.

455
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,414
- Remember in med school

456
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:16,349
when Donovan gave grand rounds?

457
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:18,017
There was that guy
who was peeing liters.

458
00:24:18,085 --> 00:24:19,485
- Glomerulonephritis?

459
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:21,921
A wrestler--steroids could
have damaged the kidneys.

460
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:24,557
Hmm, the scotch is nice.

461
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,359
- His urine
would have been brown.

462
00:24:26,427 --> 00:24:28,728
- Donovan ruled out
osmotic diuresis--

463
00:24:28,796 --> 00:24:30,730
Kidney disease.

464
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:32,732
- Pheochromocytoma?
- No hypertension.

465
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,300
Plasma metanephrine's normal.

466
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:35,301
- Devic's?

467
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:36,469
- It happened at night.

468
00:24:36,537 --> 00:24:38,171
That was the clue.

469
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:40,974
Night, recumbent body position,

470
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,909
changes in B.P.

471
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:48,748
- It's his heart.

472
00:24:48,816 --> 00:24:52,485
Run a 12-lead EKG,
watch him for four hours.

473
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:53,720
Foreman concurs.

474
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:00,760
What the hell just happened?

475
00:25:00,828 --> 00:25:03,396
Everything started to fade away.

476
00:25:03,464 --> 00:25:05,198
- You're getting better
at focusing.

477
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:07,333
Ignoring everything
that doesn't matter.

478
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:09,502
Uh-oh.

479
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,271
He looks pissed.

480
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:14,340
I think he might hit us.

481
00:25:14,408 --> 00:25:16,576
- Is your eyesight
better than mine?

482
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:19,979
- We need to talk about
the bachelor party.

483
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:21,681
- Excellent topic choice.

484
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:23,650
Surgery's so boring,

485
00:25:23,717 --> 00:25:26,219
and my lying to you
is just so yesterday.

486
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:28,888
- It's my fault for letting you
talk me into the implant.

487
00:25:28,956 --> 00:25:30,657
Cameron is not gonna be happy
about this party.

488
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:32,525
- But you, on the other hand...

489
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:34,694
- Plan on spending the rest
of my life with Cameron.

490
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:38,464
- So...I need to cancel
the fart band?

491
00:25:38,532 --> 00:25:40,800
- So...I need you
to kidnap me.

492
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:44,570
- Spoken like a true Aussie.

493
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:47,440
By the way, if you know where
I can get me the sheet music

494
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:49,108
to <i>Waltzing Matilda...</i>

495
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:55,181
Hey...want some ice cream?

496
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:57,650
We're having a sundae bar.

497
00:25:57,718 --> 00:25:58,951
- Sweet.

498
00:26:01,422 --> 00:26:03,823
- That's her name.

499
00:26:03,891 --> 00:26:05,024
- Sundae or bar?

500
00:26:05,092 --> 00:26:07,860
- Karamel.

501
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:10,096
- With a "K."

502
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:44,897
Bathroom?

503
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:47,934
- Down the hall,
two doors on your right.

504
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:49,836
- Thank you.

505
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:57,410
- Do I...
sound like...

506
00:26:57,478 --> 00:26:59,579
her?

507
00:26:59,646 --> 00:27:01,881
I do.

508
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:03,015
- It takes time.

509
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:15,428
- You still haven't slept?

510
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:19,165
And then I have
a clever response.

511
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:22,101
- EKG, normal sinus,
normal intervals.

512
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:24,837
His heart's fine.
- His heart's not fine.

513
00:27:24,905 --> 00:27:27,006
- The heart was fine
during this test.

514
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:28,741
The arrhythmia's hiding.

515
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:30,309
- Or we were wrong
about the heart.

516
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:32,044
- Could be the thyroid.

517
00:27:32,112 --> 00:27:33,613
- Hashimodo's would explain
the kid's urine

518
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,614
and brain pressure.

519
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:35,715
- Treadmill.

520
00:27:35,783 --> 00:27:38,918
- Or the arrhythmia is hiding.

521
00:27:38,986 --> 00:27:40,086
We need to stress him.

522
00:27:40,154 --> 00:27:42,188
Put the patient on a treadmill.

523
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:43,689
- The patient
just had brain surgery.

524
00:27:43,757 --> 00:27:45,224
A stress test could cause
a brain bleed and kill him.

525
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:47,360
- I value your opinion.

526
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:49,162
I value rejecting your opinion.

527
00:27:49,229 --> 00:27:50,663
- You're not doing this.

528
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:52,098
You haven't been sleeping.

529
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,200
- Cuddy doesn't actually
want you in charge.

530
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:55,701
She just wants
to avoid a lawsuit

531
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:57,870
and to win an NAACP award.

532
00:27:57,938 --> 00:27:59,839
- And if I let you
risk our patient's life

533
00:27:59,907 --> 00:28:01,507
testing an organ
we already tested,

534
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:02,675
we accomplish neither.

535
00:28:02,743 --> 00:28:04,343
Run a thyroid panel.

536
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:13,352
How do we get him
into the stress lab

537
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,654
without Foreman's sign-off?

538
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:17,023
- We could kill Foreman.

539
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,891
Is she new?

540
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,893
- Focus.

541
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:23,029
The lab simulates stress.

542
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:25,164
What if it's not simulated?

543
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:26,899
- We could tell him
his girlfriend dumped him.

544
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:28,434
- That's a tough sell.

545
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:31,070
She never leaves the room
for more than five minutes.

546
00:28:31,138 --> 00:28:32,872
We could kill <i>her.</i>

547
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,941
Or...asthma meds.

548
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:36,943
Force the heart
to beat faster.

549
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,712
- Revealing the arrhythmia.

550
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,380
Nice idea.

551
00:28:41,448 --> 00:28:42,448
- It was yours.

552
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:53,693
- I just left the room
for a few minutes.

553
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,927
He ripped out his implant.

554
00:28:54,995 --> 00:28:57,196
So much
for improving his life.

555
00:28:57,264 --> 00:28:59,966
- Actually, I think
we just saved it.

556
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:04,437
- Look at that.

557
00:29:04,505 --> 00:29:06,205
Arrhythmia.

558
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,168
- You were right
about the heart.

559
00:29:13,236 --> 00:29:14,837
Should have listened to you.

560
00:29:14,904 --> 00:29:16,705
- The correct phrasing
would be,

561
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:18,373
"I should always
listen to you."

562
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:20,108
- He's got problems everywhere.

563
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,044
What goes everywhere?

564
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:24,580
- Blood. Could be
thrombocythemia.

565
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:26,248
Excess platelets lead
to clotting throughout the body.

566
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:27,616
- Not with a normal
platelet count.

567
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,017
- So the clotting
doesn't start in the blood,

568
00:29:29,085 --> 00:29:30,853
it starts in the lungs--
pulmonary embolism.

569
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,688
- Should do a VQ scan,
see if his lungs are clear.

570
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:45,567
- Go.

571
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:00,616
You sure I did this
at Wilson's party?

572
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:02,484
- The last time,
you used grain alcohol

573
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:03,785
instead of the sambuca.

574
00:30:03,853 --> 00:30:05,554
- And it worked?

575
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:18,533
Explains my lack of eyebrows
by the end of the evening.

576
00:30:23,506 --> 00:30:25,607
By the power of greyskull, I--

577
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:36,118
- This is why
we're rehearsing.

578
00:30:38,454 --> 00:30:41,323
Ever wonder what's happening

579
00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:42,991
every time our patient
gets sicker?

580
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:44,693
- Not right now!

581
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,795
- First symptom, wrestling.

582
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:49,932
Then, under the lights
of the seizure lab--

583
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:52,034
- Are you going somewhere
with this, because this feels--

584
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,236
- Just keep doing
what you're doing--it helps.

585
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:57,272
Then, under the stress
of blindness...

586
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,107
and post-op fever.

587
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:02,077
What do all the symptoms
have in common?

588
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:09,084
- Heat.

589
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:10,619
See, if you hadn't been here,

590
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:12,487
that would have just
popped into my head.

591
00:31:12,555 --> 00:31:13,789
Which actually would have
been way cooler.

592
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,961
Foreman, kid's
got Uhthoff phenomenon.

593
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:21,129
Which means it's MS.

594
00:31:21,197 --> 00:31:22,798
Start him on double-dose
interferon.

595
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,566
- Let's get our drink on.

596
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,635
- Not before I've added
"chemical burns"

597
00:31:26,703 --> 00:31:27,936
to this guy's
cause of death.

598
00:31:30,373 --> 00:31:31,673
- Well, the patient's
responding to interferon.

599
00:31:31,741 --> 00:31:34,710
Looks like I can retire
as department figurehead.

600
00:31:34,777 --> 00:31:36,545
- Dr. Robert Chase.

601
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:37,846
We're with the department
of citizenship

602
00:31:37,914 --> 00:31:39,081
and immigration.

603
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,683
Did you recently apply
for a marriage license?

604
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:43,752
- Uh...Yes.

605
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,721
- According to our records,
your work permit is expired.

606
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:46,855
If you could come with us.

607
00:31:46,923 --> 00:31:48,056
- Um, I'm his fiancee.

608
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:49,224
I can come along
and clear this--

609
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:50,826
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
Illegals only.

610
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:55,330
- I'm--I'm sure
it's a mistake.

611
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:57,332
I'll call you as soon
as I know what's going on.

612
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,937
- Don't let House get him
in too much trouble.

613
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:18,754
- Oh ho!

614
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:29,264
- Allow me to welcome you

615
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:31,299
to the best night
of your life.

616
00:32:35,238 --> 00:32:36,538
- Ahem!

617
00:32:42,478 --> 00:32:43,445
- Whoo!

618
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:45,180
- Yeah!

619
00:32:45,248 --> 00:32:48,283
- Now, aha, a few ground rules
for the evening.

620
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:50,652
Uh, safety is job one.

621
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,222
We've now gone 18 days without
an injury in the workplace.

622
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,392
Uh, yes, these girls are all

623
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,660
working their way
through law school.

624
00:32:58,728 --> 00:32:59,895
Don't test them.

625
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:02,464
- House!

626
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:03,698
- I knew you couldn't
stay away.

627
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:11,006
- This is my apartment.

628
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,808
You can't do this.

629
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:17,145
- Clearly, reality
begs to differ.

630
00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:19,247
- Where's my furniture?

631
00:33:19,315 --> 00:33:20,582
- Out back somewhere.

632
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,950
- James!

633
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,620
- Karamel?

634
00:33:28,057 --> 00:33:28,990
Hi.

635
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:34,029
- How's your wife?

636
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,731
- Uh...we--we got divorced.

637
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:37,999
- Ohh.

638
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:39,534
- How is your cat?
- Dead.

639
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:41,336
- Oh.

640
00:33:41,404 --> 00:33:44,940
- How 'bout we go
have a drink?

641
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:46,641
- Oh...Okay.

642
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:12,834
- Yeah...yeah...

643
00:34:20,443 --> 00:34:22,277
- All right!
- Yeah!

644
00:34:27,617 --> 00:34:28,917
- You're okay with this?

645
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,619
- I paid 50 bucks for this.

646
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:31,887
- You guys are great together.

647
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:33,788
Trust is everything.

648
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,158
I gotta get some air.

649
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:37,392
Keep it real.

650
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:57,612
- You should be out there...

651
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,650
enjoying the lap dances
of your labors.

652
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:04,819
- Eh, I kind of like it
in here.

653
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:08,056
- Me too.

654
00:35:08,124 --> 00:35:11,960
To us figuring out M.S.

655
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:15,397
- And the blindness
and neuropathy and arrhythmia

656
00:35:15,464 --> 00:35:17,032
and anything else we did.

657
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:24,206
What exactly did my team do?

658
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:26,675
- Look good
in their lab coats.

659
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:28,877
Except for Taub.

660
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:32,347
- Some people just
work better alone...

661
00:35:32,415 --> 00:35:35,116
so to speak.

662
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:36,518
- One more drink.

663
00:35:36,586 --> 00:35:37,852
- No! I can't!

664
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,821
I need to take a break.

665
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:41,723
- Meet Karamel.

666
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:45,227
- Huh?

667
00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:46,861
- Maybe one more drink.

668
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,936
- Ooh...

669
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,140
- What's that taste?

670
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:01,076
Is that--

671
00:36:01,143 --> 00:36:03,211
is that strawberry?

672
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:09,584
- House, you in there?

673
00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:12,387
- Use the other bathroom.

674
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:13,388
It's in the kitchen.

675
00:36:13,456 --> 00:36:15,056
Looks like a sink.

676
00:36:15,124 --> 00:36:16,691
- Chase went
into anaphylactic shock

677
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,928
from the stripper's body butter
or something.

678
00:36:19,996 --> 00:36:21,963
- Is he okay?

679
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:24,232
- One of the residents
had an epipen, so he's fine.

680
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,969
We're taking him to the hospital
to be safe.

681
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:29,471
- Okay.

682
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:37,412
- I knew that Chase was
allergic to strawberries,

683
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,482
didn't I?

684
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:44,152
That's why you wanted Karamel
at this party.

685
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,787
- I suggested Karamel

686
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:47,822
'cause she was great
at Wilson's party.

687
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,557
- I knew about her body butter

688
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,494
and about
his strawberry allergy.

689
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:56,898
I tried to kill Chase.

690
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,367
Why would I do that?

691
00:36:59,435 --> 00:37:01,469
I don't want Cameron.

692
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:04,939
- You're not a big fan of other
people's happiness, either.

693
00:37:11,447 --> 00:37:14,416
Hello.

694
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:16,251
You confirm?

695
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:18,153
Thanks.

696
00:37:21,357 --> 00:37:22,957
That kid we saved...

697
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:24,059
he's dying.

698
00:37:24,126 --> 00:37:26,928
It's not M.S.

699
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,664
We were wrong.

700
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,346
- Thank God you're okay.

701
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:36,548
What happened?

702
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:37,715
- It was a good--

703
00:37:37,783 --> 00:37:39,050
- Uh, long story.

704
00:37:39,118 --> 00:37:41,486
- Your patient's lung failure
rules out M.S.

705
00:37:41,554 --> 00:37:43,121
We put him on a ventilator.

706
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:45,690
- Uh, enlarged lymphs could--

707
00:37:45,758 --> 00:37:47,058
- Are any of you sober?

708
00:37:49,962 --> 00:37:52,363
- Turn around.
You need to go to the hospital.

709
00:37:54,433 --> 00:37:56,000
- I need to sleep.

710
00:38:00,773 --> 00:38:03,141
- I'm you.

711
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:05,243
You can't just shut a door.

712
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:08,146
- You tried to kill Chase.

713
00:38:08,214 --> 00:38:10,215
I need to push you back down.

714
00:38:10,282 --> 00:38:11,683
You're dangerous.

715
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,619
- That's the hospital.

716
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:16,121
- Not answering.

717
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:21,459
Hello.

718
00:38:21,527 --> 00:38:23,361
- I'm here with your team,

719
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:25,363
trying to sober them up

720
00:38:25,431 --> 00:38:27,999
so they can...help treat
your dying patient.

721
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:31,035
- Foreman's dying patient.

722
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:32,704
- What causes lung failure

723
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:35,173
plus your patient's
previous symptoms?

724
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:36,741
- Eosinophilic pneumonitis.

725
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:39,377
White blood cells accumulate,
clog up the lungs,

726
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:40,478
lead to heart problems.

727
00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:41,646
It fits.

728
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:43,414
- House, are you there?

729
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:46,918
- It's not
eosinophilic pneumonitis.

730
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:48,953
I gotta crash.

731
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:50,288
- House, don't hang up.
We need your help.

732
00:38:50,356 --> 00:38:51,322
- I can't.

733
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,126
- We can solve this.

734
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:57,962
- Good night.

735
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,099
- Eosinophilic pneumonitis
could actually make sense.

736
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:02,267
- No, House ruled it out

737
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:03,401
because it would
affect the larynx.

738
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:06,471
Patient would be...

739
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:08,039
Hoarse,

740
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:09,774
Which we wouldn't notice
in a deaf kid

741
00:39:09,842 --> 00:39:10,842
who rarely speaks.

742
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,445
- Wait.

743
00:39:14,513 --> 00:39:15,914
Everyone's getting
breath mints.

744
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,920
- We need to hear
Seth speak.

745
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:23,721
- But that means
taking out the tube.

746
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:25,423
Isn't that dangerous?

747
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:27,225
- It's the safest way to
confirm what's wrong with him.

748
00:39:27,293 --> 00:39:29,761
- I need him to breathe out
as I pull on the tube.

749
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:31,095
- okay.
Breathe out.

750
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:44,642
- Say, "ah."

751
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:50,248
- Ahhhh.

752
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:59,857
- I'm sorry.
We were wrong.

753
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:03,494
I need to, uh,
suction out your throat

754
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:05,163
before we reintubate.

755
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,238
Your son smoke?

756
00:40:13,305 --> 00:40:14,439
Smoke?

757
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:16,107
I don't think so.

758
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:18,243
- Tobacco stains
on his teeth.

759
00:40:22,081 --> 00:40:23,514
- He says he used
to chew tobacco

760
00:40:23,582 --> 00:40:24,782
to cut weight
for wrestling.

761
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,517
- Used to?

762
00:40:26,585 --> 00:40:28,686
- Chewing tobacco wouldn't
explain his symptoms.

763
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:32,257
- But not chewing tobacco
might.

764
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:35,393
Taub was right.
It's sarcoidosis.

765
00:40:35,461 --> 00:40:37,662
The tobacco releases toxins.

766
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,864
Those toxins suppressed
his immune system.

767
00:40:39,932 --> 00:40:41,666
Once he quit chewing,

768
00:40:41,734 --> 00:40:43,334
the absence of those toxins

769
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,036
kicked a dormant condition
into hyper-drive.

770
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,040
- Is it treatable?

771
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:52,577
- Usually responds
to corticosteroids

772
00:40:52,645 --> 00:40:54,512
and methotrexate.

773
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,648
I'll start the meds.

774
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,356
- I need sleeping pills.

775
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:06,891
I was gonna hit up Wilson,

776
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,493
but he's not
answering his phone.

777
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,628
- He must have
left it in his pants.

778
00:41:10,696 --> 00:41:11,996
Which he wasn't wearing

779
00:41:12,064 --> 00:41:14,232
when the police found him
trying to walk home...

780
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,635
oddly, from his own apartment.

781
00:41:20,873 --> 00:41:23,374
- Pills.

782
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:25,443
- Your patient's doing fine.

783
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:27,011
Thanks to your team.

784
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:32,050
- It wasn't eosinophilic
pneumonitis, was it?

785
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:34,085
- Sarcoidosis.

786
00:41:34,153 --> 00:41:35,186
- Good.

787
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:40,191
- House, please talk to me.

788
00:41:49,935 --> 00:41:51,369
- I haven't
slept through the night

789
00:41:51,437 --> 00:41:53,871
since Kutner killed himself.

790
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:14,792
- The wrestling
might have to wait.

791
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,795
I'm gonna tell your doctors
to repair your implant.

792
00:42:21,734 --> 00:42:23,668
- And then
you ripped it out

793
00:42:23,736 --> 00:42:26,070
rather than live with it
for a few days, even.

794
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,674
I'm your mother.

795
00:42:29,742 --> 00:42:31,809
This is my call.

796
00:42:31,877 --> 00:42:34,145
I don't know if I'm
making the right one.

797
00:42:34,213 --> 00:42:36,814
But it's mine to make.

798
00:43:17,356 --> 00:43:19,090
- Sleep well?

799
00:43:19,158 --> 00:43:21,592
