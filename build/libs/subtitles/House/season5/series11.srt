107
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:10,507

108
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:12,242
Yes, you should.

109

113
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,056
She dropped out.

114
00:05:26,123 --> 00:05:27,390
Is she okay?

115
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,626
Not health-related.

116
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:30,961
She just wants
to drop out.

117
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:32,996
Why?
- She didn't say.

118
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:34,564

a book worth
hundreds of dollars?

130
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,466
To make you
ask that question.

131
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:10,967
Can you really put a price tag
on screwing with people?

132
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:12,536
Can you get us into
Natalie Soellner's locker

133
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:14,271
While we're here?

134
00:06:14,338 --> 00:06:17,007
House always
has an agenda.

135
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:18,441
Just screwing
with us isn't--

136
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:19,810
Yeah, he'd never do that.

137
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:21,211
Oh, wait--
he already did last year.

138
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,646
Remember the Secret Santa gift
he got himself?

139
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:24,014
He was making us fight

140
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:25,215
over who could get him
the best present.

141
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:28,118
This time he's
just making us wonder.

142
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:30,587
<i>No animosity,</i>
<i>no ugly competition.</i>

143
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,422
I think it's
a real present.

144
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,791
If it's real, then House
really was freaked.

145
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,560
And if it affects him,

146
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:37,794
eventually
it'll affect us.

147
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:40,230
Uh-oh.

148
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,299
Maybe it wasn't those kids
who poisoned Natalie.

149
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,734
<i>Maybe it was</i>
<i>Natalie herself.</i>

150
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:49,606
I didn't try to kill myself.

151
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:51,174
Then why'd you have
all those painkillers?

152
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:53,643
In case
I get a headache.

153
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,645
Well, maybe you
took a few too many.

154
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:57,647
Do you have any kids?

155
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:59,549
No.

156
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:01,618
<i>But high school</i>

You know what
they did last year?

168
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,645
They took these photos of me

169
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,448
but it wasn't.

170
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,049
It was for this website.

Acetylcysteine

But we have to act fast.

178
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,268

00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:54,538
Okay.

181
00:07:54,605 --> 00:07:57,407
She was the happiest,
sweetest little girl and--

182
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:01,311
and a year ago
she hits puberty,

183
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,414
<i>and it's like this</i>
<i>secretive little stranger</i>

184
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:05,749
moved into her room.

185
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:07,317
I try to talk to her about
what she's going through.

186
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:13,089
Give her the treatment.

187
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:14,658
You can't really think
that she tried--

188
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:15,992
I don't know
what to think.

189
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,067
If it's a subpoena,

190
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:26,136
he's gotten that
kind of present before.

191
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,872
It was a book.
That narrows it down.

192
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,340
Just look for someone

193
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:32,442
who knows how to read
or has been to a bookstore.

194
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,812
Most bookstores don't carry
Joseph Bell on surgery.

195
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:41,084
Did it have a note?

196
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:42,752
"Greg--made me
think of you."

197
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,654
Green wrapping paper?

198
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:46,957
How did you know that?

199
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:51,528
What is it?

200
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:54,998
It's nothing.

201
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:58,034
Yes--when something's
nothing,

202
00:08:58,102 --> 00:08:59,136
<i>the natural response</i>
<i>is to guess</i>

203
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:00,704
the color of the paper
it's wrapped in

204
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:03,373
<i>and then descend</i>
<i>into stunned silence?</i>

205
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,879
Irene Adler.

206
00:09:08,946 --> 00:09:11,314
Christmas, 2001.

207
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:13,150
Sarcoid symptoms,

208
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:16,052
But she didn't respond
to methotrexate.

209
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,123
I've never seen him
so obsessed.

210
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:23,326
He saved her with a last
minute Wegener's diagnosis,

211
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:25,428
but the hours he put in--

212
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:27,097
I thought
it would kill him.

213
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,732
And then...

214
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,837
well, he fell for her.

215
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:36,773
<i>But it was too soon</i>
<i>after Stacy and--</i>

216
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:39,509
It sounds silly,

217
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:44,281
but Irene was
the one who got away.

218
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:45,849
Really?

219
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,218
No, you idiots.

220
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:50,153
House is just
screwing with you.

221
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,521
You think
there's some woman

222
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,056
with a mysterious green
wrapping paper trademark?

223
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:54,157
Then how did you guess--

224
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:56,293
I could be wrong.

225
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,396
It's possible
a secret admirer gave House

226
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:00,630
the same book
I gave him last Christmas.

227
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,468
And the same paper
I wrapped it in

228
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:06,269
and the note I wrote.

229
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:07,637
We gotta go.

230
00:10:13,377 --> 00:10:14,878
<i>Heartbeat?</i>

231
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:17,781
150.
B.P. 180 over 110.

232
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:20,183
Crackling 3/4
of the way up.

233
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:23,487
Guess this means she didn't
try to kill herself.

234
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:30,903
Well, scratch
the hallucinations.

235
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:32,238
That's from the mushrooms.

236
00:10:32,305 --> 00:10:35,641
Leaves liver failure
and now pulmonary edema.

237
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,343
And you--

238
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,279
Standing there,
beseechingly.

239
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:41,947
Yes, I was going
to stalk you at home,

240
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:44,049
but it was a busy week
and your office is closer.

241
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:45,651
<i> Thirteen and Foreman</i>
<i>were busy drug trialing</i>

242
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,785
<i>and we needed an answer</i>
<i>on the overdose,</i>

243
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:49,121
so we called her in.

244
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:51,423
<i>She's just updating us.</i>
- Convenient.

245
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:52,858
Update's done.

246
00:10:56,763 --> 00:10:58,430
This is a good
experience for me,

247
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:00,166
as my parents
never got divorced.

248
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,234
Theories?
- Glue sniffing.

249
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:04,336
Effects on the lungs
would have been immediate.

250
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:07,206
<i> House, we all know
what's going on here.</i>

251
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:08,974
Cuddy gave you
that present.

252
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:10,609
No.
Infections?

253
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:13,879
No fever, no polys
in the sputum.

254
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:15,347
I think--

255
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:18,017
I think she loves you.

256
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:19,185
<i>I told you to lay off the present.</i>

257
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:21,821
And the L.S.D.

258
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,489
<i>We got distracted</i>
<i>by the painkillers.</i>

259
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,658
Toxins are still
the most likely--

260
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:28,027
Just tell her
how you feel.

261
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:30,696
If you won't,
then I will.

262
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:32,398
I'll walk
right down there.

263
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:33,966
Damn it.

264
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:37,236
Love like this
needs to fly free.

265
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:45,144
You talked to Wilson.

266
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:47,313
He has very girly
handwriting, by the way.

267
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,915
I knew I should have
just wrapped a new present.

268
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:52,351
<i> You said the patient
volunteered. Where?</i>

269
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:53,919
Uh, Pleasant Valley.

270
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:56,822
Soup kitchen in Trenton.

271
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,892
Thirteen and Kutner,
search the home and the school.

272
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,993
<i>Taub...</i>

273
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,162
You take
the anal swabbing

274
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,499
of the fragrant and
contagious homeless man.

275
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,504
<i> Why don't you hang out</i>
<i>in the video store</i>

276
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:14,306
and tell everyone
Kevin Spacey's keyser soze?

277
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:15,841
And by the way,

278
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,476
that ending really
made no sense at all.

279
00:12:17,544 --> 00:12:20,079
You had my present
for a year

280
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,413
and didn't even
open it?

281
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:22,815
I had no way of knowing

282
00:12:22,883 --> 00:12:24,350
there was an expensive
book inside.

283
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,784
Completely
meaningless prank,

284
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:27,186
even for you.

285
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:28,487
Stealing your ice cream

286
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:29,822
is a completely
meaningless,

287
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,190
albeit delicious,
prank.

288
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:32,825
Observing
my team's reactions

289
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:34,093
to unexplained
phenomena

290
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:35,494
could have been
pretty useful.

291
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:36,896
Of all the ways
to mess with people,

292
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:39,899
why give yourself
an imaginary present?

293
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,233
Have you checked
the prices

294
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:42,902
for fireman strippers
recently?

295
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:44,303
Yes.

296
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:46,605
The holidays--

297
00:12:46,673 --> 00:12:47,973
they're hard for you.
I get it.

298
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,409
You see the people
around you

299
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:51,844
giving and receiving gifts,

300
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:53,813
having sustained,
meaningful relationships,

301
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,114
and since you can't,

302
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:57,917
something deep
in your subconscious

303
00:12:57,984 --> 00:12:59,919
makes you create
the appearance of a gift.

304
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,754
Sad.

305
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,089
You really passed
your psych rotation?

306
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:07,092
It's too bad you can't
just be nice to people.

307
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,928
You could get
a real present that way.

308
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,596
If I wanted gifts,

309
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,965
I would just look deep
into my patients' eyes

310
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,467
and act like you.

311
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:16,602
"Oh, I'm so sorry
you're dying,

312
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,404
"Mrs. Moron.

313
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:20,039
"Of course
I'll sleep with you.

314
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:21,807
What I lack in skill
I can make up for in--"

315
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,409
You'd just wind up
insulting her,

316
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:25,277
perhaps calling her
Mrs. Moron.

317
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:26,879
Right, 'cause
I'm physically incapable

318
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,214
of being polite.

319
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:32,051
Being kind in a sustained,
meaningful way?

320
00:13:32,118 --> 00:13:33,752
No.

321
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,488
Oh, I get it.

322
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:37,756
You're trying to get me
to prove you wrong,

323
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:39,525
then I'm gonna be
nice to all my patients

324
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:41,026
all through
the holiday season,

325
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:43,195
and then Mr. Potter won't
steal Tiny Tim's porridge.

326
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:44,797
I'm totally on it.

327
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,900
Yeah, that actually
is what I'm trying to do.

328
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:49,869
And the pathetic part is,

329
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:51,403
it's not gonna work.

330
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:54,073
You're right.

331
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:57,776
I gotta stop
being such a jerk.

332
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,448
Oops.

333
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:04,550
Just kind of
undercut myself, there.

334
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:09,822
<i>Across the country.
Be paying attention.</i>

335
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,690
<i>Well, people should pay attention</i>

336
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:13,759
<i>because they could</i>
<i>expect up to 23...</i>

337
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:19,632
Janice?

338
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:21,267
<i>I'm Remy.</i>

339
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:23,435
I'm--
yeah, I remember you.

340
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:28,674
I heard you
left the trial.

341
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,909
Yeah.

342
00:14:29,976 --> 00:14:32,511
If there's some way
I could help--

343
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,247
Um, it--

344
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:36,749
it was that doctor.

345
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:38,083
He--the one that
was runnin' the tests.

346
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:39,351
Dr. Foreman.

347
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,020
Yeah.

348
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:43,222
He's a great neurologist.
He's a great guy.

349
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,357
You--you like him?

350
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:47,593
Why don't you?

351
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:48,961
I told him

352
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:51,397
that those injections
were making me sick

353
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:52,765
<i>in my stomach, </i>

354
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:56,035
<i>and he just</i>
<i>gave me antacid.</i>

355
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,803
We were warned that
nausea's a side effect,

356
00:14:57,871 --> 00:15:01,006
and giving you antacids
is all he really could do.

357
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,242
No, he told me,

358
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,510
"get over it."

359
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,014
With or without
the use of drugs,

360
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:13,219
I don't have a long time.

361
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,791
I'm not gonna spend it
bein' his guinea pig.

362
00:15:23,597 --> 00:15:25,264
<i>House.</i>

363
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:26,966
It's tuberculosis.

364
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:29,235
You got that
from an anal swab?

365
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:30,636
Man, you're good.

366
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:31,904
There was
a more subtle clue.

367
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,305
Homeless guy,

368
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:36,041
uncontrollably
hacking up blood.

369
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:38,110
Cough's lasted two months,
he was cachectic.

370
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:40,112
Unless you can
tie him to the patient--

371
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,481
Yes, again, if only
there was some subtle clue,

372
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,949
<i>like the fact that he</i>
<i>was standing next to her</i>

373
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:45,518
in the soup line
for a week.

374
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:47,586
I hate spunk.

375
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:48,888
<i>T.B. can cause</i>
<i>liver failure,</i>

376
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:51,724
lung symptoms--
fits.

377
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,559
Start her on
the standard regimen.

378
00:15:53,627 --> 00:15:55,094
Uh--you don't have
clinic duty today.

379
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,164
Who says it's a duty?

380
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:01,934
Hi. I'm Greg.

381
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,335
Hi, I'm Whitney.

382
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:05,271
Hi, Whitney.
How can I help you?

383
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:06,639
I have a--

384
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:08,808
a terrible headache.

385
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,242
Oh, sorry
to hear that.

386
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,211
I'll get you fixed up.

387
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:13,813
Is there anything else
you need?

388
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,548
Bottle of water?

389
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,249
Coffee?
Mint tea?

390
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:18,684
No, but that's so nice.

391
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:20,085
Usually the clinic doctors
are kind of rushed.

392
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:22,788
If you can't be nice,

393
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,356
why be a doctor?

394
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:28,727
So where do you
feel the pain?

395
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,329
In the back
of my head here.

396
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:31,597
Uh-huh.
That's beccaria's sign.

397
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:33,032
That'll be gone by
your third trimester.

398
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:35,267
Oh, I'm not in school.

399
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,871
Neither is your fetus.

400
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:42,174
Oh, God.

401
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:43,576
You didn't know
you were pregnant?

402
00:16:43,643 --> 00:16:45,845
How do--you know that
just from the headache?

403
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,482
How do I know?

404
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,550
I missed my period,

405
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:53,219
I got fat,
threw up,

406
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:54,987
oh, no, wait--
that's how you know.

407
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,388
What?

408
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,224
I know because
of the tight shirt

409
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,959
stretched over
the swollen boobs,

410
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:01,794
the salt craving you've
imported into the clinic,

411
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:04,063
the motion sickness patch
that doesn't do anything

412
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:06,165
for the kind of sickness
that you feel in the morning.

413
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,733
Yeah, I'm a virgin.

414
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:10,069
So is my fianc?.

415
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:12,805
I believe him.

416
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:14,640
Aren't there other ways
I could get pregnant,

417
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,109
like...sitting
on a toilet seat?

418
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:19,078
Absolutely--there
would need to be a guy

419
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:20,646
sitting between
you and the toilet seat,

420
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:21,881
but yes, absolutely.

421
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:25,084
I was doing so well.

422
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:32,158
Natalie?

423
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,461
Oh, God. Natalie.

424
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,763
She's having a seizure.
Put her on her side.

425
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:39,698
Nurse!
- Is this from the T.B.?

426
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,066
Not with
the supple neck.

427
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:42,334
I don't know
what this is.

428
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:44,203
Four milligrams
lorazepam.

429
00:17:49,229 --> 00:17:50,997
<i>Liver, lungs, and now brain...</i>

430
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:54,367
which has mysteriously
reappeared.

431
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:58,437
Speaking of mysteriously
reappeared.

432
00:17:58,505 --> 00:18:00,439
Her A.L.T.
is 20 times normal.

433
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:02,742
Transaminases
and P.T.'s way up.

434
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:04,176
She's gonna lose
her liver.

435
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:05,378
We gotta get her
on the transplant list.

436
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:07,213
You keep showing up.

437
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:08,814
<i>You also keep leaving.</i>

438
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:10,783
<i>It's possible that you</i>
<i>have the hots for me,</i>

439
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:12,785
but really,
really hate this kid.

440
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:14,220
<i>It's also</i>
<i>remotely possible</i>

441
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:16,155
that I have that reversed.

442
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:18,391
She's a nice kid.
I wanna make sure she's okay.

443
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,259
Hepatic fibrosis?

444
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,061
Normal complement level,
normal-sized liver.

445
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:22,962
<i>She remind you of...</i>

446
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,463
You?

447
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:25,831
Nah, you weren't a loser
in high school.

448
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:27,600
<i>You had every Tom,</i>
<i>Dick, and Hershel</i>

449
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,435
wet-dreaming about you.

450
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,171
<i>But she could</i>
<i>be making you</i>

451
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:34,140
<i>think of another helpless,</i>
<i>chubby little girl</i>

452
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:36,242
you recently met.

453
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,410
You are not
really making this

454
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:38,711
about the baby
I tried to adopt.

455
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:40,313
<i>It's been a few weeks.</i>

456
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,881
<i>Just enough time</i>

457
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:43,182
to get over hurt feelings.

458
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,251
Natalie's 16.

459
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,687
I think you're confusing
being maternal

460
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:49,655
<i>with being human.</i>

461
00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:51,524
If we hadn't
ruled out the mushrooms--

462
00:18:51,592 --> 00:18:53,426
Maybe we shouldn't have.

463
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:54,260
<i>Forget toxic--</i>

464
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:55,561
think allergic.

465
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:56,929
Severe mold allergy

466
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:58,331
<i>could cause,</i>
<i>uh, liver failure,</i>

467
00:18:58,398 --> 00:18:59,432
<i>respiratory arrest,</i>
<i>and encephalopathy.</i>

468
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:01,234
She ate the 'shrooms
days ago.

469
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:03,035
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>she'd still be sick.</i>

470
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:05,771
Unless it also gave her
a fungal infection.

471
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,773
<i>Give her a prick test in antifungals.</i>

472
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:16,682
<i>Hey.</i>

473
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,351
Thank you
for the gift.

474
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:20,019
<i>I really appreciate it.</i>

475
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:22,021
I spoke to Janice.

476
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:23,389
She okay?

477
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:24,724
Yeah.

478
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:27,960
Her nausea--

479
00:19:28,028 --> 00:19:29,228
<i>she said you</i>
<i>told her to, like,</i>

480
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:30,429
get over it?

481
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:32,331
And?

482
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:34,667
Nausea isn't something

483
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:36,802
you can overcome
with sheer willpower.

484
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,905
Which is why I didn't
prescribe willpower.

485
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:40,273
I prescribed antacids.

486
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,507
If she
can't handle that,

487
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:42,742
she'd have to leave
the trial anyway.

488
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:45,645
Just call her,
say you're sorry.

489
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:46,946
She'll come back.

490
00:19:47,014 --> 00:19:49,215
No.

491
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:50,750
God, you're acting
like House now.

492
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:53,119
No, I'm not acting
like House,

493
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:55,021
Which is exactly why
I don't need to apologize.

494
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:56,355
I'm not being cruel.
I'm not being manipulative.

495
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:58,090
You said
the same thing to me

496
00:19:58,158 --> 00:19:59,325
when I told you
I was having a hard time.

497
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:01,027
And it worked.

498
00:20:01,094 --> 00:20:03,729
She's a 40-year-old woman
who's falling apart

499
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:05,264
physically
and emotionally.

500
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:06,599
She's dying.

501
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:09,502
Look, I know seeing

502
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,370
the ghost of your
Christmas future is tough.

503
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:13,205
<i>But the only way</i>
<i>I can help her</i>

504
00:20:13,273 --> 00:20:14,774
is to make sure
she follows her regimen,

505
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:15,908
not by becoming
her life coach.

506
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:19,879
You're not acting
like House.

507
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:21,781
You <i>are</i> like him.

508
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:28,688
Dr. House?

509
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:31,023
This is my fianc? Geoff.

510
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:34,493
She says you told her
you can get pregnant

511
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:35,761
from sitting
on a toilet seat.

512
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:39,599
I said those words,

513
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,300
but with a particular
inflection.

514
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:43,536
I knew it was untrue.

515
00:20:43,604 --> 00:20:44,704
Well, is there
any other way?

516
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:46,038
Isn't it possible?

517
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:48,708
There was
a reported case

518
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:50,176
of a civil war soldier

519
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:52,078
<i>who was shot</i>
<i>in the testicles,</i>

520
00:20:52,145 --> 00:20:56,649
and the musket ball
carried the non-musket ball

521
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,017
<i>into the uterus</i>

522
00:20:58,085 --> 00:20:59,552
<i>of a woman working</i>
<i>in a neighboring field.</i>

523
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,220
Nine months later,
a miracle child was born.

524
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:04,390
Also, maybe she
cheated on you.

525
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,425
We made a promise.

526
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:08,961
We d--we do
other stuff in bed.

527
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:10,296
Couldn't
some of his sperm

528
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:11,731
have made it
up there somehow?

529
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:13,666
More likely,
it came from the guy

530
00:21:13,734 --> 00:21:15,301
whose penis
made it up there somehow.

531
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:16,802
<i>But...</i>

532
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,471
sure, anything's possible.

533
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:20,172
I want a paternity test.

534
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,540
Tell him that amnios

535
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:22,875
are dangerous this early on
in the pregnancy.

536
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:24,176
Are they?
- Well, who cares?

537
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:25,711
He doesn't know.

538
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:28,848
Well, we'll--we'll
do the paternity test.

539
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:37,490
No reaction.
- That's bad?

540
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:39,125
If you had
a mold allergy,

541
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:40,493
it would explain
your symptoms.

542
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:42,562
We'll find out what's wrong,
don't worry.

543
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:45,164
And, uh,
I know some things

544
00:21:45,232 --> 00:21:46,666
<i>are hard to talk about</i>
<i>with your parents around,</i>

545
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:47,967
but kids
can be really mean.

546
00:21:48,035 --> 00:21:48,868
<i>There are people</i>
<i>you can talk to--</i>

547
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:49,969
<i>programs--</i>

548
00:21:50,037 --> 00:21:51,037
I'll--I'll be okay.

549
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:53,372
You're in good spirits.

550
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,640
You feeling better?

551
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,242
No.

552
00:21:58,211 --> 00:21:59,545
<i>I was just</i>
<i>doing my homework.</i>

553
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:01,380
<i>I'm such a dork,</i>
<i>I guess that cheers me up.</i>

554
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:02,748
Parents brought it?

555
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:04,517
No, Simon did.

556
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:06,385
The jocky kid
in your class?

557
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:08,921
Yeah. He just left.

558
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,994
Security.

559
00:22:15,062 --> 00:22:16,896
I was just bringing her
her homework.

560
00:22:16,964 --> 00:22:18,297
You helped bully
this little girl

561
00:22:18,365 --> 00:22:20,066
and completely refuse
to accept responsibility.

562
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:21,968
No way you came here
out of compassion.

563
00:22:22,035 --> 00:22:23,202
That only leaves guilt.
What'd you do to her?

564
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,837
Nothing.
- Stop lying.

565
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:26,172
Or I'll take the drugs
I found in your locker

566
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,807
down to the cops,
you slimy little jerk.

567
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:32,645
This kid didn't do
anything to you.

568
00:22:32,713 --> 00:22:34,580
This isn't about me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.

569
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:36,315
You were bullied yourself
when you were in school.

570
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:37,617
Take it easy.

571
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:39,018
I wasn't bullied.

572
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:40,152
Right--
the Indian foster kid

573
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,287
whose parents were shot
in front of him.

574
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:43,856
You were clearly
Homecoming King.

575
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,527
Let's try this again.
Just tell me--

576
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:50,696
Honestly,
you don't understand.

577
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:55,768
We used to be friends.

578
00:22:55,836 --> 00:22:58,037
<i>And I'd be friends</i>
<i>with her now</i>

579
00:22:58,105 --> 00:23:00,907
if, you know, people
wouldn't make fun of me.

580
00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:03,009
There's nothing you could
tell us that'll help?

581
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:06,312
Did she mention
she used to drink a lot?

582
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,413
<i>No.</i>

583
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:08,581
How do you know that?

584
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:11,317
Look, don't tell anyone,
all right?

585
00:23:11,385 --> 00:23:14,253
I had my brother's I.D.
and I kind of supplied people.

586
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:15,688
<i>I used to get her</i>

587
00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:17,757
a few bottles of vodka
each week.

588
00:23:17,824 --> 00:23:18,858
Why'd you stop?

589
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:20,293
She got her own I.D.

590
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,861
Said it was cheaper
buying it herself.

591
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:23,296
You can go.

592
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,001
I think we got
our diagnosis.

593
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:30,870
Our little girl's
a drunk.

594
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:37,364
I don't drink.

595
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:40,133
I did back then, but--

596
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:41,668
you could die.

597
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:43,804
We can't get you
on the transplant list

598
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:45,672
until we know why
your liver is failing.

599
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,076
Alcohol abuse
would explain that.

600
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:50,677
The seizures could be
from withdrawal.

601
00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:52,813
I haven't drunk
in six months.

602
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,082
I didn't even drink
that much back then.

603
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:57,751
A couple
of vodka bottles a week?

604
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:59,986
I didn't open
half of them.

605
00:24:01,456 --> 00:24:03,090
I just bought them
because--

606
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,792
you know, 'cause Simon
was selling them.

607
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,128
We used to be friends.

608
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,329
And that's, like,
the only way

609
00:24:09,397 --> 00:24:10,597
I could get him
to even talk to me.

610
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:12,299
Then why did you
stop buying from him?

611
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,400
He said
you got your own I.D.

612
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,970
I don't know.

613
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,305
See, that's
not a good answer.

614
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,708
Remember when you asked me
if I had any kids?

615
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:23,110
I don't.

616
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:24,878
I don't know, maybe it
has nothing to do with it,

617
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:26,480
but I was good at school,

618
00:24:26,547 --> 00:24:29,282
good at work,
lousy at life.

619
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,385
I screwed up every
relationship I ever had.

620
00:24:31,452 --> 00:24:32,853
And I thought,
"why would I

621
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,422
want to bring a child
into this?"

622
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,790
But then I got older.

623
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:38,392
And...

624
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:44,831
How you feel now
will pass.

625
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,334
Don't let it screw up
your whole life.

626
00:24:49,337 --> 00:24:50,837
It's already screwed up.

627
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,509
My asthma.

628
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,044
They said they'd fix it,

629
00:24:57,111 --> 00:24:58,845
but it didn't make
any difference at all.

630
00:24:58,913 --> 00:25:01,982
Well, sometimes
doctors make mistakes...

631
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:05,018
Anna,
and then you have to try

632
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,720
twice as hard to fix them.

633
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:08,455
Are you using your inhaler?
<i>- All the time.</i>

634
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:09,856
Go through one a week.

635
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:12,959
You sure
you're using it right?

636
00:25:13,027 --> 00:25:14,261
Do I look like an idiot?

637
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:15,796
No.

638
00:25:18,132 --> 00:25:19,766
Why don't you show me
how your inhaler works?

639
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:30,811
Jerk.

640
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:35,449
Uh, what was
that all about?

641
00:25:35,516 --> 00:25:37,451
Jamaican chicken recipes.

642
00:25:37,518 --> 00:25:39,920
The parents said
no to the benzos,

643
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:41,588
but I still think Natalie's
not being honest with me.

644
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:44,624
So she's willing to die
to cover up some boozing.

645
00:25:44,692 --> 00:25:46,193
She's very depressed.

646
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,594
She feels
like she deserves

647
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:48,862
what the other kids
are dishing out on her.

648
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,397
I think she
either wants to die

649
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,066
or she wants the attention
that dying gives her.

650
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,203
I have no idea
why you care so much.

651
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,938
Tell Kutner
to start her on benzos.

652
00:25:58,005 --> 00:25:59,606
House, the parents just--
- Uh-uh.

653
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:01,208
Not the alcoholism.

654
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:02,809
Seizures.
Totally different.

655
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:05,245
Don't need
their approval for that.

656
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:11,718
You sure
you want to know?

657
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:13,320
<i>If it makes it</i>
<i>any easier,</i>

658
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:14,421
I'm gonna
tell you anyway.

659
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,256
We want to know.

660
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:23,397
What does it say?

661
00:26:33,274 --> 00:26:34,508
Don't leave.

662
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:46,787
You go home last night?

663
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:48,355
I meant to.

664
00:26:48,423 --> 00:26:49,656
Started
reading this file,

665
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:50,690
<i>just couldn't</i>
<i>put it down.</i>

666
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:52,225
Let me ask you--

667
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:53,393
That patient
that dropped out,

668
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:54,628
the one I told you about--

669
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,929
Yeah.

670
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:57,030
You think I
should pursue it more?

671
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:59,733
No, patients drop out.

672
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:01,134
That's why we
start with hundreds.

673
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,236
Well, I just thought if
there's an easy way to make

674
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:05,072
the people who drop off
come back, then why not--

675
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:06,473
They're not people.

676
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,508
Really?

677
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:09,843
I thought
the zombie trials

678
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:11,111
were all completed
during phase two.

679
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:12,746
You can't see
the patients as people.

680
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:14,014
<i>You can't even</i>
<i>see them as patients.</i>

681
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:15,048
They're numbers.

682
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:17,050
Look...

683
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:19,386
a friend of mine
has this disease.

684
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:21,288
I don't wanna know.

685
00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:22,723
<i>There's a reason</i>
<i>this is double-blind--</i>

686
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,192
Any personal stake
we have skews the studies.

687
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:26,960
<i>Science is not about</i>
<i>human relationships.</i>

688
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,295
<i>It's about results.</i>

689
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:30,497
Now, you know that.
You work for House.

690
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,366
Why do you think I
brought you on as my partner?

691
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:37,204
Dr. Taub!

692
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:38,772
She was talking to me
and then she just passed out.

693
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,541
<i>Her heart's slowing down.</i>
Can you fix it?

694
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:43,443
Can you fix it?
- I'm trying.

695
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:45,278
Pushing one amp atropine.

696
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:55,622
<i>We've been waiting here for six hours.</i>

697
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,591
Am I the father or not?

698
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:01,762
No.

699
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:03,130
<i>But...</i>

700
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:06,166
She also didn't
cheat on you.

701
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,773
Normally,

702
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,909
<i>sperm meets egg,</i>
<i>D.N.A. meets D.N.A.,</i>

703
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:18,278
<i>goes back to her place,</i>
<i>cells divide,</i>

704
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:21,114
<i>nine months later,</i>
<i>joy is bundled.</i>

705
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:22,849
That's normally.

706
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,184
Abnormally,

707
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:25,886
<i>An egg could have</i>

708
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:27,754
two naturally occurring
gene mutations

709
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:29,689
<i>that don't naturally</i>
<i>occur together.</i>

710
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:33,927
<i>A spontaneous calcium spike</i>

711
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:35,095
<i>could prep the egg</i>
<i>for fertilization</i>

712
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:36,596
<i>without sperm,</i>

713
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:39,099
<i>and a division mistake</i>
<i>could let the egg split up</i>

714
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:41,301
<i>without ever needing</i>
<i>male D.N.A. at all.</i>

715
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:43,236
Parthenogenesis.

716
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,238
A baby without a daddy.

717
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,974
In humans, it's only
ever been theorized,

718
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:49,376
but it was never proved.

719
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:51,578
Until now.

720
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,881
Mommy.

721
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,116
Baby.

722
00:28:56,184 --> 00:28:59,386
Your daughter has
only maternal D.N.A.

723
00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:01,254
I personally
checked this five times.

724
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,658
In seven months,
you will have...

725
00:29:07,095 --> 00:29:09,363
a virgin birth.

726
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:13,200
Merry Christmas.

727
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:27,066
Gotta tell you about
this clinic patient.

728
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:29,001
Natalie's liver is
continuing to fail.

729
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,303
And now bradycardia.

730
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:32,405
Atropine isn't keeping
the heart rate up.

731
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:33,706
We're gonna have to
put her on a pacemaker.

732
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:35,708
Alcohol withdrawal

733
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:38,011
would cause her heart
to race, not crawl.

734
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:40,146
There's nothing structurally
wrong with her heart.

735
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:42,682
E.K.G., echo, electrolyte
panel are all normal.

736
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,150
Multiple
endocrine syndrome?

737
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:46,619
Free T-4's normal.
Hypothalamic brain tumor?

738
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:48,554
Didn't come up
on the C.T. scan.

739
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:51,424
It's hitting
all her organs.

740
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:53,092
Could be the blood.
What's her alk phos?

741
00:29:57,364 --> 00:29:58,464
300.

742
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:02,101
It can't be leukemia.

743
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:09,842
High alk phos could
also be from liver failure.

744
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,644
She's a teenager--
means bone growth

745
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,312
and destruction
could throw it off.

746
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,014
Maybe, but it's higher
than you'd expect.

747
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:18,451
Start her on chemo.

748
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,820
We'll do a bone marrow
biopsy to confirm.

749
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:23,022
Why are you ordering
tests instead of treatment?

750
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,824
<i>Her heart and liver</i>
<i>are about to give up.</i>

751
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:26,125
Do whatever you need to.

752
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:29,462
Why are you
so attached to this girl?

753
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,367
It's your call.

754
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,970
He doesn't want us
to treat her.

755
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:40,406
If it's leukemia,

756
00:30:40,474 --> 00:30:42,075
even if we kill
every cancer cell,

757
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:43,209
<i>her heart and liver</i>
<i>are too far gone.</i>

758
00:30:43,277 --> 00:30:44,410
A double transplant--

759
00:30:44,478 --> 00:30:46,179
With brain involvement?

760
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:48,348
The committee
won't even open the file.

761
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:51,017
There's no reason
to put a dying girl

762
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:52,251
through
a painful treatment

763
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,586
if it can't save her.

764
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,391
He's being kind.

765
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:00,860
I'll arrange a biopsy.

766
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:12,205
<i>Mrs. Burke?</i>

767
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:16,042
<i>We are conducting</i>
<i>another trial</i>

768
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,677
in tandem with yours.

769
00:31:17,745 --> 00:31:19,912
Same drug, lower dose.

770
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,081
The nausea will be less.

771
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,184
I did some checking.

772
00:31:25,252 --> 00:31:26,686
I can switch you.

773
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:30,490
Here's the forms
if you want back in.

774
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:41,034
What if we're wrong?

775
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:43,369
Maybe we shouldn't
have overlooked autoimmunes.

776
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:45,638
High sed rate--

777
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:46,939
We went over this.

778
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:48,474
Normal complement level.

779
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:49,976
So it isn't
hepatic fibrosis.

780
00:31:50,044 --> 00:31:52,512
Could still be

781
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,414
Microangiopathic
vasculitis.

782
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,949
With high-dose steroids,

783
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:58,217
we might be
able to reverse--

784
00:31:58,285 --> 00:31:59,652
You run a hospital

785
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,220
That treats thousands
of patients every day.

786
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:02,488
Some of them die.

787
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:04,057
Every day.

788
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:05,291
If you're gonna
get this worked up

789
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,959
over every one of them--

790
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:09,162
Yes!

791
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,134
B.R.B.

792
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:16,235
What is it?

793
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:18,304
Thank you from a patient.

794
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:19,706
For you?

795
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,307
I saved her marriage

796
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,742
by showing
that her pregnancy

797
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,610
was the result
of parthenogenesis.

798
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:26,746
Human parthenogenesis?

799
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,481
You proved--
- Yep.

800
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:29,816
It's unbelievable.

801
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:31,484
But I personally
checked it five times.

802
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:32,985
How did you
check it five times?

803
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:34,320
The cycler's broken,

804
00:32:34,388 --> 00:32:35,555
you would have
had to send it out.

805
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:36,823
<i>It would have taken--</i>
- Oh, yeah.

806
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,091
That does sound impossible,

807
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:39,692
now that I think of it.

808
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,960
I guess
the better explanation

809
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:43,162
is that the paternity test
showed she cheated

810
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,431
so I faked the whole
parthenogenesis thingy.

811
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:46,933
<i>What?</i>

812
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,202
<i>Why?</i>

813
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:50,703
I win.

814
00:32:52,906 --> 00:32:55,241
You faked
a scientific miracle

815
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:56,542
just to win
a bet with Wilson?

816
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,877
Mmm, more an argument.

817
00:32:57,945 --> 00:32:59,812
I realize it
would have been simpler

818
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,447
to just fake
the paternity test,

819
00:33:01,515 --> 00:33:03,249
but hey--Christmas
spirit and all that.

820
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,286
I think you're confusing
nice and evil again.

821
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:09,222
<i>Letting a woman</i>
<i>deceive her husband</i>

822
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:12,725
by inventing a virgin birth
just so you can--

823
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:14,527
And it obviously
would have been more fitting

824
00:33:14,595 --> 00:33:15,962
if the baby had
been born on Christmas,

825
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,930
not just invented then.

826
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,665
It's not leukemia.

827
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:23,036
Seizures,
liver failure--

828
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:26,839
It's eclampsia.

829
00:33:29,276 --> 00:33:32,245
This means we don't
have one dead patient.

830
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,281
We have two.

831
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:47,336
Um...

832
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:49,838
You have a disease
called eclampsia.

833
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:53,142
It causes liver failure,
pulmonary edema,

834
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,910
<i>and seizures.</i>

835
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:57,313
<i>It's also associated</i>
<i>with cardiomyopathy.</i>

836
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,948
That's a pregnancy disease.

837
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:00,883
<i>You tested her</i>
<i>when she came in.</i>

838
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:03,786
Uh, you can get eclampsia

839
00:34:03,854 --> 00:34:05,054
up to a month
after giving birth.

840
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:07,723
That's ridiculous.

841
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,758
<i>How could she hide a pregnancy?</i>
- Loose clothes.

842
00:34:09,826 --> 00:34:11,160
<i>She's heavy</i>
<i>to begin with.</i>

843
00:34:11,228 --> 00:34:12,361
It was probably premature.

844
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,762
<i>If it was</i>
<i>three weeks ago,</i>

845
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,464
They could have missed it
on a physical exam.

846
00:34:15,532 --> 00:34:16,932
<i>The baby's why</i>

847
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,167
you quit drinking,
isn't it?

848
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,971
<i>Why you asked me</i>
<i>if I had kids.</i>

849
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:24,940
Why you feel guilty.

850
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:31,647
I'm sorry.

851
00:34:31,715 --> 00:34:34,383
Oh--
who did this to you?

852
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:36,118
Simon.

853
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:39,588
<i>It wasn't bad.</i>

854
00:34:39,656 --> 00:34:41,257
<i>We were like boyfriend/</i>
<i>girlfriend for a while,</i>

855
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:43,526
We just
didn't tell anyone.

856
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:47,096
He doesn't
even know about--

857
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,433
What happened
to the baby?

858
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:52,735
I was gonna give it away.

859
00:34:55,705 --> 00:34:57,973
If they found out
at school--

860
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,909
<i>I was at</i>
<i>the soup kitchen</i>

861
00:34:59,976 --> 00:35:01,343
<i>And she started coming.</i>

862
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:03,846
<i>There was this empty house</i>
<i>down the street,</i>

863
00:35:03,914 --> 00:35:06,448
But then
she wasn't breathing.

864
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:12,588
I tried so hard,
but I couldn't do anything.

865
00:35:12,656 --> 00:35:13,923
I'm...so sorry.

866
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:19,128
If I had her
in a hospital,

867
00:35:19,196 --> 00:35:20,996
maybe she'd be alive.

868
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:22,865
Can you cure this?

869
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:27,069
The damage to the heart
and liver are permanent.

870
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:29,838
I'm gonna die?

871
00:35:37,747 --> 00:35:39,181
I'm sorry.

872
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:45,321
I didn't even bury her.

873
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:49,191
I just
put my coat over her.

874
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:49,118
<i>Get out of my house.</i>

875
00:36:50,554 --> 00:36:52,588
I'm a doctor.

876
00:36:52,656 --> 00:36:54,390
I don't care
who you are.

877
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:56,125
Did you, uh...

878
00:36:56,193 --> 00:36:57,493
Find the body
of a baby?

879
00:36:57,561 --> 00:36:58,794
I said get out.

880
00:37:01,498 --> 00:37:03,232
<i>Michael?</i>

881
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:06,969
Who are you?

882
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:13,676
That's not your baby.

883
00:37:13,743 --> 00:37:15,077
<i>You're tiny.</i>

884
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:17,580
<i>There's no way you gave</i>
<i>birth three weeks ago.</i>

885
00:37:17,647 --> 00:37:19,348
She's my sister's.

886
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,449
That baby is sick.

887
00:37:20,517 --> 00:37:21,717
<i>She needs clean water.</i>

888
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:22,985
<i>She needs real heat.</i>

889
00:37:23,053 --> 00:37:26,055
She was probably born

890
00:37:26,122 --> 00:37:27,456
<i>with a partially blocked</i>
<i>airway and--</i>

891
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:29,258
<i>might even have brain damage.</i>

892
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:32,127
You can't take care of her
in a place like this.

893
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:34,730
<i>Shut up.</i>

894
00:37:34,798 --> 00:37:36,332
I took care of her--

895
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:37,533
I know.

896
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:40,269
You found her.

897
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:42,671
You saved her life.

898
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:50,346
Now you have
to let her go.

899
00:38:23,713 --> 00:38:25,047
Who is that?

900
00:38:25,115 --> 00:38:26,582
It's your daughter.

901
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,783
She was alive.

902
00:38:29,553 --> 00:38:31,220
People found her
and took care of her.

903
00:38:46,536 --> 00:38:50,306
# runnin' the race
like a mouse in a Cage #

904
00:38:50,373 --> 00:38:52,007
# gettin' nowhere. #

905
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:53,876
She's beautiful.

906
00:38:53,944 --> 00:38:56,145
# but I'm trying #

907
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:58,047
# forgin' ahead #

908
00:38:58,114 --> 00:39:01,984
# but I'm stuck
in the bed that I made #

909
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:05,221
# so I'm lying #

910
00:39:05,288 --> 00:39:07,623
# but if you keep real #

911
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:10,426
# close #

912
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:13,495
# yeah, you stay real #

913
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:16,532
# close #

914
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,001
# I will reach you #

915
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:21,704
# I'm down #

916
00:39:21,771 --> 00:39:24,607
# to a whisper #

917
00:39:24,674 --> 00:39:27,776
# in a daydream #

918
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:31,313
# on a hill #

919
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:33,115
# shut down to a whisper... #

920
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:34,383
Kutner.

921
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:36,318
No transplant?

922
00:39:36,386 --> 00:39:38,787
We appealed.
Too sick.

923
00:39:38,855 --> 00:39:40,523
How much time
does she have left?

924
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,824
A couple of days
at most.

925
00:39:41,892 --> 00:39:42,892
What about the baby?

926
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,593
Seems healthy,

927
00:39:44,661 --> 00:39:45,861
But it's
too early to tell.

928
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:47,129
She's in the hospital
for observation

929
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:49,265
For a few days,
but after that--

930
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:50,766
Best case, winds up
with her teenage father

931
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:52,067
who just got voted

932
00:39:52,135 --> 00:39:54,403
captain of the varsity
bullying team.

933
00:39:54,471 --> 00:39:55,871
He's just a kid.

934
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:58,974
You all right?

935
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:00,876
I gotta go.

936
00:40:00,944 --> 00:40:02,511
# and I've stopped
trying to find #

937
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,313
# any peace in my mind #

938
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:10,219
# 'cause it
tangles the wires #

939
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:12,888
# but if you keep real #

940
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:14,390
# close #

941
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:17,860
# yeah, you stay real #

942
00:40:17,928 --> 00:40:19,662
# close #

943
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:21,363
Jonathan.

944
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:22,765
Yeah?

945
00:40:22,832 --> 00:40:24,433
It--it's, uh...

946
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:25,701
It's Lawrence Kutner.

947
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:28,270
Wh-why are you here?

948
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:31,307
I wanted to apologize.

949
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:32,841
<i>For all of</i>
<i>the horrible stuff</i>

950
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:35,277
I did to you
in high school.

951
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:36,979
I'm sorry.

952
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:41,383
# shut down
to a whisper #

953
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:44,086
# can you hear me? #

954
00:40:44,154 --> 00:40:47,356
# can you hear me? #

955
00:40:47,424 --> 00:40:50,025
# still? #

956
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:55,130
# the sound #

957
00:40:55,198 --> 00:41:00,803
# tires on my lips... #

958
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:03,339
<i>What's gonna happen to her?</i>

959
00:41:03,406 --> 00:41:04,807
I spoke to both sets
of grandparents.

960
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:07,576
It's too painful.

961
00:41:07,644 --> 00:41:09,211
They're putting her
up for adoption.

962
00:41:12,782 --> 00:41:14,383
What are you gonna do?

963
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,888
I already spoke
to a lawyer.

964
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:23,759
<i>I become a foster parent</i>

965
00:41:23,827 --> 00:41:25,961
and then I adopt.

966
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:27,830
# shut down
to a whisper #

967
00:41:27,898 --> 00:41:30,165
# can you hear me? #

968
00:41:32,536 --> 00:41:33,702
# can you hear me? #

969
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,438
# I'm down
to a whisper... #

970
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:39,475
Merry Christmas,
Cuddy.

971
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:41,243
Hey.

972
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:45,748
<i>Hey.</i>

973
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:56,926
# can you hear me? # #

974
00:42:07,504 --> 00:42:08,504
Where is everybody?

975
00:42:08,572 --> 00:42:10,105
Down at the party.

976
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:14,577
I heard Janice is back
on the trial.

977
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:16,745
My Christmas gift
to you.

978
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:20,349
I was wrong.

979
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:22,218
You're not House.

980
00:42:24,187 --> 00:42:27,156
Yeah, well, that's
my Christmas gift to myself.

981
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:37,433
We should
go to the party.

982
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,835
We should.

983
00:42:39,903 --> 00:42:45,741
# chestnuts
roasting on an open fire #

984
00:42:51,414 --> 00:42:54,950
# Jack frost nippin'
at your nose #

985
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:03,292
# yuletide carols #

986
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,528
# being sung by a choir... # #
