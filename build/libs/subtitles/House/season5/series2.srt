1
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,067
Bring it up
about six more feet.

2
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:42,533
Okay, you can go ahead
and start dropping it.

3
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,834
Whoa.

4
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,800
Whoa!

5
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:12,301
Rico!

6
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,966
Class is over.

7
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:16,133
What's going on?
Who are you?

8
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,801
I'm a doctor.

9
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:19,567
Did you have a corneal
transplant five years ago?

10
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:20,966
Yes.

11
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:22,734
Every other patient who had
a transplanted organ

12
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,000
From that donor
is either dead or dying.

13
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,966
You got a purse?

14
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,500
I feel fine.

15
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't mean to scare you,
but so did the others.

16

18
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:10,866
One living, one almost dead.

19
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,534
Four fully dead.

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,801
Nothing in common
except their donor.

21
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:16,367
Carl got a new heart
and lung.

22
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:17,767
Liver kills him.

23
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,722
Tibalt got a new liver,
lung killed him.

24
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:23,300
Holly got a new kidney,
her heart blows up.

25
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,000
And frank, the old guy
gasping for breath upstairs,

26
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:28,300
He got an intestinal graft,
his pancreas is failing.

27
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,999
All within eight months
of each other.

28
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:32,300
And in each case, serious
complications came on suddenly

29
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:33,331
And without warning.

30
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:34,612
Which means arrhythmia,

31
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:36,999
Massive pulmonary embolus,
or cerebral bleed.

32
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,167
What did wilson do
for me?

33
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,800
If the donor had

34
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,534
An infection that somehow
slipped by a screening,

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,933
It could lay dormant-

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,112
Five organ systems hit.

37
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,300
Would need five infections

38
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,168
For it to somehow slip
by screening.

39
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,400
Oh, sure, he made me laugh
on a rainy day,

40
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,267
Made me see the colors
i never knew-

41
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,767
None of the donated organs
were hit.

42
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:59,400
It means whatever they got
came from the donor's blood.

43
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:00,534
That wouldn't help us narrow
down what-

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,634
It narrows down who.

45
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:02,867
Corneal transplants
are bloodless.

46
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:04,267
It means
apple's gonna be fine.

47
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,500
You secure enough
in that theory to send her home?

48
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,667
I guess we could wait
till we figure out

49
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:09,667
What's wrong with frank.

50
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,600
On the other hand,

51
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,300
Gilbert gottfried
makes me laugh.

52
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:15,001
And how many colors
are there really?

53
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,068
Once you got red, blue,
and green-

54
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:18,941
He paid for your lunch,
liked monster trucks,

55
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:19,738
And was your conscience.

56
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:20,675
Autoimmune disease.

57
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:22,567
A.N.A. At autopsy
of all four victims were normal.

58
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:24,400
Wouldn't cover vasculitis.

59
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:25,253
Henoch-Schonlein purpura-

60
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:27,400
Antiphospholipid antibodies,
normal.

61
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,634
Then that leaves cancer.

62
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,701
Cancers have names.
They have a progression.

63
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,367
They affect
specific organs.

64
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:34,300
Bone cancer can't turn
into liver cancer.

65
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:35,534
Forget cancer.

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
It's cancer.

67
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,034
It's not cancer.

68
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:41,667
You're right,
of course.

69
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:43,034
What was i thinking?

70
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,034
No single type of cancer
blew up three organs

71
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,200
In the chest
while also herniating

72
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:47,168
In the fighter's brain stem.

73
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,200
The fighter's irrelevant.

74
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,567
You don't like coincidences.

75
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:51,901
It would be a coincidence
if six transplant recipients

76
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,134
Had nothing else wrong
with them-

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,467
Like being an idiot,
which leads to getting

78
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:55,801
Your head knocked off.

79
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,200
The others had cancer.

80
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,534
Four autopsies
and about 1,000 lab tests say

81
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,801
It's not cancer.

82
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,867
Redo the thousand tests
and the four autopsies.

83
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:04,767
Taub and kutner,
check out the donor.

84
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,467
Find out which cancer-
He didn't die of cancer.

85
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:07,667
His head got chopped off

86
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:09,168
In an industrial accident.

87
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,867
Find out which cancer
would have killed him.

88
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,068
Check the home and office
for carcinogens, toxins-

89
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:14,500
He's been dead
for four years.

90
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,400
I assume his home's been rented
to someone else by now.

91
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:18,701
Find out which cancer
killed them.

92
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:22,634
Did i forget you?

93
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:24,701
You can check out
the patient's eye.

94
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,101
Put this on dr. O'shea.

95
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:41,101
And some chips.

96
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:42,200
Forget your wallet,
house?

97
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:44,503
No.

98
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:48,237
I'll take care of it.

99
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,701
Check.

100
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:53,934
Are you following me?

101
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:58,300
Word is you're
into monster trucks.

102
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,667
My kids like it.
But not you?

103
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:02,068
Predator's okay,

104
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:04,175
But i think the california
crusher is overrated.

105
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:13,472
Are you checking me out?

106
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:14,550
You're astute.

107
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,767
No. How many pills did you just take?

108
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:21,600
Vicodin, opioids,
some b12.

109
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,667
Need a little kick
in the afternoon.

110
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:25,363
You got a problem
with that?

111
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,701
I think
i'm falling in love.

112
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:29,967
Her right eye's failing.

113
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,867
No, it's not.

114
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,034
Everyone else's
transplanted organs were fine.

115
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,068
It means her eye
is fine.

116
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:36,101
We need to remove
the eye.

117
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:38,767
It's her only working eye.

118
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,701
We could remove the other one,
but since it's not killing her,

119
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,409
I thought this way
was less insane.

120
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,467
Do you have
some ethical problem

121
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:47,767
With what i'm doing
that you could express

122
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,701
In a unique way
which might actually make me

123
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,238
Think that i'm wrong
even though i'll never admit it?

124
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:53,112
Yes.

125
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,628
You are funny.

126
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:58,233
The problem's not in her eye.
It's in her head.

127
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,034
You wanna come over
and watch prescription passion

128
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,233
At my place tonight?

129
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,467
You know
i'm not gay, right?

130
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:05,434
Neither am i.

131
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,400
If you don't want to have sex,
that's cool with me.

132
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,734
I'm not coming over
to your home.

133
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:10,534
I'll grow on you.

134
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,901
L... p... e...

135
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:20,567
Do i have to be
in the same room as him?

136
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:22,500
Whatever he's got,
you've got.

137
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,767
Fifth line.

138
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:24,834
Are you sure?

139
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,001
Pretty sure.

140
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:27,675
Fifth line.

141
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:32,675
Am i gonna die?

142
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:34,934
Can we talk about something
besides you for a moment?

143
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,425
Like maybe the fifth line?

144
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:42,800
F... e... o... s... p.

145
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,200
Damn.

146
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:47,467
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,734
We need to remove
your eye.

148
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,134
My eye?

149
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,168
A moment ago,
you thought you were dying.

150
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,400
Blind's actually good news.

151
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,134
Unfortunately,
he's wrong.

152
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,534
You just did the test.

153
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,901
She didn't squint.

154
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,333
Which means the eye thinks
it's fine.

155
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,434
It was wrong. I know.
The eye doesn't think.

156
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,634
The brain thinks, which means
if the thinking's wrong,

157
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:05,734
The brain's wrong.

158
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,267
Which means it's spread
to the brain,

159
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,168
Which means it's too late
for us to remove the eye.

160
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:14,734
Which means we're gonna have
to remove your whole head.

161
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:18,300
Don't worry.
It doesn't hurt.

162
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,316
&&&

163
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:27,159
???

164
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,675
500 different things
can cause hallucination.

165
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:32,474
Doesn't mean
it's neurological.

166
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,274
It does if one of
the other organ recipients

167
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:35,942
Also had a brain issue.

168
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:39,374
Did he just drop
had brain issues. Hands?Them

169
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,174
If his pupils dilated,

170
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:42,908
If his pupils were fixed,
if there was a twitch...

171
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:43,841
He got hit in the head,

172
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:45,575
He died,
no mystery.

173
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:46,708
That was your point.

174
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:47,975
Yesterday.

175
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:48,908
You live,
you learn.

176
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:50,541
Who shot this?

177
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,107
Guy who runs the gym
has a camera.

178
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:54,841
Uploads the nasty stuff
online.

179
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:57,741
Can't see
the dead guy's face.

180
00:08:57,808 --> 00:09:00,942
I can't see his face,
can't see the twitch,

181
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,363
Can't see the pupils-

182
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:04,174
We know the tennis player
had a heart problem.

183
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:07,942
We can maybe tie that
to the tuba player's lungs,

184
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:09,107
And then somehow tie
both those things,

185
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,541
To the construction worker's
liver,

186
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:11,841
And then possibly meander

187
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:13,508
Over to frank's
pancreatic failure,

188
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:17,341
But nothing causes simultaneous
brain and heart problems.

189
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:18,775
Cancer made no sense.

190
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,141
The head and heart
make less than no sense.

191
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:22,008
That makes no sense.

192
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:23,241
Um.

193
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:26,641
I know.

194
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,575
I was making
a point.

195
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:31,474
Oh, good.
I thought you were an idiot.

196
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,608
Why are you talking?

197
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:39,050
Oh, the guy doing manual labor
can't have an opinion?

198
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:42,999
I might be a genius
who just happens to have

199
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,708
A passion
for fixing coffee machines.

200
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,608
No, i'm obviously not,
but that's rude

201
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:48,808
To make assumptions
about people.

202
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:51,908
Donor's history came up clean.

203
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:56,141
Did he just laugh?

204
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:57,575
No, no, i sneezed.

205
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,841
He's a genius coffee repairman.

206
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:02,238
Coffee repairman
who wears argyle socks?

207
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,841
I thought i already talked
about not judging.

208
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:09,775
What kind of idiot
wears argyle socks

209
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,975
With construction boots?

210
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:13,374
Uh, i'm not an idiot.

211
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:17,241
I'm just-I'm not good
at disguises.

212
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:19,308
Who is he?

213
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:22,308
He's apparently a very bad
private investigator.

214
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:24,608
Uh, why is he pretending
to fix the coffee machine?

215
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:27,107
Because i wanted to find out
what you guys found out

216
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:29,008
Before i find out
what he found out.

217
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:32,174
So i can find out if i need
a private investigator.

218
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:34,008
So, nu?

219
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:35,775
There's no history
of unusual infections,

220
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:38,503
No international travel
in the 12 months-

221
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,175
No, seriously,
that's how i sneeze.

222
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:48,474
He was in madrid
and the bahamas.

223
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,374
Credit card receipts
showed no-

224
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,474
Girlfriend paid.
There is no girlfriend.

225
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,274
She was
his high school sweetheart.

226
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:55,808
High school sweetheart
is married to his best friend.

227
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,487
I know.
Shh.

228
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:59,141
She had a kid four years ago.

229
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:00,441
Timing fits.

230
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:01,441
She's still pretty hot
though.

231
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:02,708
You find out anything
medical?

232
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,141
The kid has a tummy ache.

233
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:08,575
Also, the dead guy was exposed
to mercury, mold,

234
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:10,474
And hydrous perchloric acid

235
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,241
Because their sex pad
was next to a garage

236
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:14,308
That was demolished
after those toxins were found.

237
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,174
Oh, yeah,
that will be

238
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:18,975
$2,300.

239
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,741
I'll get you
a check.

240
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:23,141
No, i don't take checks.

241
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:24,975
You think
i'm gonna stop payment?

242
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,841
Aren't you?
Of course, i am.

243
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,975
$2,300.
That's insane.

244
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,341
Actually, that price includes
footage of the boxing match

245
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:32,708
From four different angles.

246
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,474
30% of the crowd
paid by credit card.

247
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,775
I got their names.

248
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:37,074
Four of them had
digital cameras,

249
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:38,608
Which i composited
like nasa did

250
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:39,942
For the pics of mars.

251
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,474
You know, the rovers
and all that.

252
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:48,042
Pupils were dilated.

253
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,341
But he didn't drop his hands,

254
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,641
Which means he maintained
muscle tensity-

255
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,141
Say it.

256
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:53,741
You were right.

257
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:55,241
God, that was petty
of me.

258
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:56,541
He maintained muscle tensity,

259
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:58,308
But was momentarily distracted
when he got hit.

260
00:11:58,374 --> 00:11:59,641
That's a temporal lobe seizure.

261
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,341
Does that p.I. Guy mean
we don't have to break

262
00:12:01,408 --> 00:12:02,641
Into people's homes anymore?

263
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,408
It's the whole reason
you went to medical school.

264
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,608
I'm not gonna take that
away from you.

265
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:06,875
He's better
than we are.

266
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:08,741
And costs more.
Gonna biopsy the brain.

267
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:10,341
No.

268
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:11,408
Say it.

269
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,074
You were right,
but no.

270
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:15,908
Temporal lobe
controls speech,

271
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:16,942
Hearing, memory.

272
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:19,074
She loses those things,

273
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:19,975
She's gonna be
a terrific date,

274
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:20,862
But beyond that-

275
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:22,808
We cut out a piece of it,
good chance she's a vegetable.

276
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,207
Nothing to hear,
nothing to say,

277
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:25,308
Nothing to look back on.

278
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:26,942
You're right.

279
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:28,675
She has so much
to live for.

280
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:31,641
Do we have another patient
who's almost finished

281
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,113
With all their living?

282
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:35,207
So it's okay to stab his brain
because he's old?

283
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:37,341
No, it's okay to stab
his brain

284
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:39,107
Because he's dead
if you don't.

285
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:41,363
Get the widow
to say yes.

286
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:44,374
No.

287
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:45,808
The lung inflammation is
a complication

288
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,074
Of the pancreatic failure,

289
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,875
Which is reversible.

290
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,408
This is actually
his best chance.

291
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:51,738
If we can find out
what's wrong...

292
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,775
How can a test
that will probably kill him-

293
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:54,841
I didn't say-

294
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,308
You said
it was extremely risky.

295
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,274
What does extremely mean?

296
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,738
Please.

297
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:03,541
I'm sorry.
I can't.

298
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,174
I have a husband.

299
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:06,808
I have a two-Year-Old
daughter.

300
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,274
Her name is julia.

301
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:10,113
You'd be saving
her mother.

302
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,708
I think you're lying.

303
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:15,800
You haven't had one visitor.

304
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,550
Not one phone call
since you've been here.

305
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,575
Does she have a child?

306
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,999
No.

307
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,644
But her life
is still worth-

308
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:26,741
More than my husband's?

309
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:28,608
I lied to save my life.
Wouldn't you?

310
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,741
Not at another human being's
expense.

311
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:31,741
No, you'd just rob me
of my only chance

312
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:32,841
So your husband can struggle

313
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:33,975
To breathe
for a few more days.

314
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,308
Just shut up.

315
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:37,107
I don't want to hear from you. Ladies.

316
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:38,575
You want to hate me so you
won't feel guilty. Shut up!

317
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:39,808
Frank?

318
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,141
Give me a scalpel.

319
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:42,608
Frank.

320
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:48,575
Charge.

321
00:13:57,975 --> 00:13:59,174
He's coding.

322
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:01,908
Clear.

323
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:06,008
Clear.

324
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:07,174
Frank!

325
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,374
Clear.

326
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:12,141
Clear.

327
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:22,374
Did you get
the consent?

328
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:23,942
No.
Tell foreman to get it.

329
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,875
Old people are scared
of black people.

330
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,641
It won't matter.
Patient's dead.

331
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,808
Sa the brain.

332
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,875
Don't need consent
for an autopsy.

333
00:14:57,675 --> 00:15:01,519
Well, at best, we're gonna bat
one for six on this one.

334
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,988
Thin slices
through the parietal

335
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:04,120
And temporal lobes
were clean.

336
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:06,519
Occipital and
frontotemporal regions

337
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:06,800
Were also-

338
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,054
Brain's clean.
Moving on.

339
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,878
To where?

340
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:12,420
We've gone from making no sense,
to making less sense,

341
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,821
And then taken
a step backwards.

342
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:16,253
Each of these people
were killed by one thing

343
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,054
That attacked one organ.

344
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,621
But never the same organ.

345
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,054
Could the donor have had
two things wrong?

346
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,587
Or six things wrong?

347
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:25,988
Metabolic diseases specialize.

348
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:27,454
Everything else specializes,

349
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
But cancer plays
the field.

350
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:29,887
You're back to cancer?

351
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:32,654
Metastasis is just a fancy word
for screws around.

352
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:34,054
Any type of cancer?

353
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,354
I don't know.

354
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,621
There would be evidence
of cancer.

355
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,554
There is.
We just haven't found it yet.

356
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,021
You need it to be cancer
so you have an excuse

357
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:41,187
To talk to wilson.

358
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:42,454
Give me something else

359
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,821
That explains this constellation
of patients,

360
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:45,921
Then you can call me
an ass.

361
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,120
I didn't call you an ass.

362
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:49,654
Perforated intestine.

363
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:51,187
If this thing started
as normal bacteria

364
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:52,787
Living in the intestines

365
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:54,387
But got into a blood vessel

366
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,887
Through a vascular anomaly
in the bowel wall,

367
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:59,320
Then they would affect every
organ through the blood stream.

368
00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:01,988
It screws up everything.
For everyone.

369
00:16:03,454 --> 00:16:04,854
Okay.

370
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:07,863
It's a long shot,
it is possible i'm an ass.

371
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:11,320
Ironically, we need to do
a colonoscopy to confirm.

372
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,554
We checked apple inside and out

373
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:14,420
When she came in;
she's clean.

374
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:15,721
The anomaly would have to be
intermittent

375
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:16,988
Or they all would have died
within a day.

376
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:18,787
She starts getting
abdominal pain,

377
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,654
Shove a tube up her rear
before it can get away.

378
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,021
And test anyone else
with stomach pain.

379
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:24,454
Everyone else is dead.

380
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,854
Not everyone.

381
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:27,654
The one thing the donor gave
to each of these people

382
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,454
Is his dna.

383
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,821
Anyone else
have his dna?

384
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,054
You want to do a colonoscopy

385
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,320
On a healthy four-Year-Old?

386
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:38,687
She has a tummy ache.

387
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:40,253
If kutner's right,
it's not a tummy ache,

388
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,387
It's a fatal brain or heart or
lung or liver or pancreas ache.

389
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:47,487
I'm not gonna scare the hell
out of the poor kid's mom

390
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:49,954
Because of a long shot corollary
to a long shot theory.

391
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:52,021
Fine

392
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,287
Tell her the truth.

393
00:16:54,354 --> 00:16:57,921
Then ask if daddy knows
who the real daddy is.

394
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:14,120
Does she have to be awake?

395
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:17,175
We need her to tell us
when it hurts.

396
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,253
She'll get over it.

397
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,021
Your husband might not have.

398
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,354
What if a kid wants
ice cream?

399
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,153
The sign outside
says 'closed.'

400
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,187
Dr. O'shea's not right
for you.

401
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:38,253
What'd you find out?

402
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,268
Why are you
investigating him?

403
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:44,687
'Cause i need to know
if he lends money interest-Free.

404
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,354
What did you find out?

405
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:49,120
I want some ice cream.

406
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:52,987
Not until you learn
to read.

407
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,721
You're supposed
to trust friends.

408
00:17:56,787 --> 00:17:57,554
I don't know the guy.

409
00:17:57,621 --> 00:17:58,654
I got no logical reason-

410
00:17:58,721 --> 00:17:59,988
To be his friend?

411
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:01,687
Have you never seen
an after-School special?

412
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:03,921
That is part of the pleasure
of friendship:

413
00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:05,687
Trusting
without absolute evidence

414
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:08,160
And then being rewarded
for that trust.

415
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,787
You're taking pictures
of a guy

416
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,487
Who's having an affair
with his own sister.

417
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:13,487
And you're lecturing me
about the rewards of trust.

418
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:16,021
There are two types of people
that hire me.

419
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:17,054
No, actually,
there are three types

420
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,988
Of people that hire me,

421
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:19,706
But the third type's irrelevant
to the point i want to make.

422
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:22,222
Do you have a special rate plan
for being a pain in the ass?

423
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:24,300
One type wants to find out
that they're right,

424
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,600
One type wants to find out
that they're wrong.

425
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,033
Which type am i?

426
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,667
You're the third type.

427
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,434
You lead
with the irrelevant types?

428
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,933
You're the type that doesn't
care if you're right or wrong

429
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,033
Because they've hired me
to investigate the wrong person.

430
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,267
That's an actual type?

431
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,734
You want me
to check out wilson.

432
00:18:37,862 --> 00:18:39,400
You want to find out
if he's-

433
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,500
How do you know about wilson?

434
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:41,933
What do i do for a living?

435
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,925
Have you been checking me out?

436
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,434
I've been paying for that?

437
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,634
So far,
you haven't paid for anything.

438
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,667
You want to find out
he's pining;

439
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:52,033
You want to find out

440
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,400
If there's something
about him

441
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,700
That will tell you
he's gonna come back

442
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,253
Or something you can use
to make him come back.

443
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,267
Is there?

444
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:07,267
No, no, there's nothing.

445
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,600
Sorry.

446
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,867
That will be $900.

447
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I gotta go.

448
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:24,801
I'll get you a check.

449
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,700
Colonoscopy was clean.

450
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,634
Then that just leaves cancer.

451
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,400
The fact that the kid's
colonoscopy was negative

452
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:40,700
Doesn't prove anything.

453
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:43,300
Yes, the fact
that it didn't prove anything

454
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,300
Didn't prove anything.

455
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,378
Excellent point.

456
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:46,834
We don't know
if the kid inherited anything.

457
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,300
Even if she did,

458
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,901
Kutner's theory is that
the thing's intermittent.

459
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:52,300
The opening would have
to be open shortly before death.

460
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:55,133
Unfortunately, we can't know
when shortly before death is

461
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,634
Until shortly after death.

462
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,100
And that seems
like an obstacle.

463
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,534
What if there was a way
around that?

464
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:03,367
Then we're kind of all sweating
over nothing.

465
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,267
Not around death,
around death as an obstacle.

466
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,434
We need to see his colon
at work.

467
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,734
You do know
what death means, right?

468
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,233
Without a living system,

469
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,267
There's not enough pressure
to get fluid all the way up.

470
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,933
Life we can't create, yet,
but pressure's easy.

471
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,425
We use the same high pressure
water jet

472
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:21,315
We use to test
cardiac workload.

473
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,933
I mean, he's not gonna be awake
to tell us where it hurts-

474
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,253
It's not gonna-
Do it.

475
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:48,133
It's kinda stuck.

476
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,500
It's more than stuck.

477
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,233
The bowel's been dead
for six hours.

478
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,987
No matter what
you shoot up there, it's closed.

479
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:05,700
This is nuts.

480
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,367
It's adjustable.

481
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:13,734
It's working.

482
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:16,033
Yeah. Wow.

483
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:19,691
Not much.
Increase the pressure.

484
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,738
The endoscope's bowing.
Push on the stomach.

485
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,300
Those are normal
bodily fluids.

486
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:31,267
Yeah, normal bodily sewage.

487
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,925
Put the pressure
back on.

488
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,550
That's the end.
No leaks.

489
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,550
Wait.

490
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,191
What's that?

491
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:43,700
That's just dark
'cause i'm at the end.

492
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:44,634
What if you're not
at the end?

493
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,100
What if it's a core lesion?

494
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,133
Maybe a little more pressure?

495
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,767
Not too much.

496
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:51,734
If it is the end and we-

497
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:58,832
It's finally accelerating.

498
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:01,550
Apple's heart rate
has become irregular.

499
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,999
Breathing is labored.

500
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:05,253
Colonoscopy's still showing
no leaks.

501
00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:06,612
What if it is autoimmune?

502
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:10,191
What if we don't have
conversations we've already had?

503
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:11,358
Four out of the five
didn't linger.

504
00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:13,224
They got sick
and died.

505
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,725
We don't have time to dismiss
things we've already dismissed.

506
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,124
Nothing fits.

507
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:19,025
See, that's an example
of a conversation

508
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:20,291
We've already had.

509
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:22,158
She's sick.
Something fits.

510
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:23,858
Ms?
No!

511
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,992
Okay, from now on,
no one says anything

512
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,592
Unless no one's said it
before.

513
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,391
Where are you going?

514
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,925
You guys start
immuno-Gels

515
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:44,258
On her csf to look
for hidden protein markers.

516
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:45,325
Then start sequencing
her genes.

517
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:46,358
I'm gonna start treatment.

518
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:47,358
Treatment for what?

519
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:47,940
Cancer.

520
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,992
It's not cancer.
Chemo's toxic.

521
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:51,892
It's something.

522
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:54,258
Which means we should treat her
for something.

523
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:13,628
She's fine.
Where's her chart?

524
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:15,725
You rang emergency
to get her chart?

525
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:16,792
I know.
That was bad of me.

526
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:17,999
But i'm pretty sure

527
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:19,258
The chart's supposed to be
attached to the bed

528
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:20,658
So that gimp doctors

529
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:21,758
Don't have to look
all over the place

530
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:23,128
While patients die.

531
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,091
Thank you so much.

532
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,550
And some peppermint tea
when you get a chance.

533
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:41,625
I need you
to sign something.

534
00:23:41,692 --> 00:23:44,692
Consent
to chemotherapy.

535
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,378
You found cancer?

536
00:23:47,488 --> 00:23:48,458
No.

537
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,862
Then you have tests
indicating-

538
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:52,738
Nope.

539
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:53,592
Then why should i sign it?

540
00:23:53,658 --> 00:23:55,525
That's a good question.

541
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,892
It deserves
a complicated answer.

542
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:01,858
Placebo effect.

543
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:04,059
People have confidence
in doctors,

544
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:05,892
They have confidence
in diagnoses,

545
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:07,725
Confidence in medicine.

546
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:08,858
Sometimes they get
a little better

547
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,892
Just because they think
they will.

548
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,525
And that can make us think

549
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:14,091
That the wrong answer
is the right answer.

550
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:16,025
Which is very bad.

551
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:19,692
So you do have proof
that it's cancer

552
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,658
But you can't tell me
because it might affect

553
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:24,625
The way i react
to the medicine?

554
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:28,059
If that were true, and it would
certainly make sense,

555
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:30,862
Do you think i could tell you
that it's true?

556
00:24:41,124 --> 00:24:43,331
I was practically blind
before the transplant.

557
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:45,692
2200 vision.

558
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:48,224
Didn't you cover all this
personal stuff with dr. Foreman?

559
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:51,491
You don't care
who i used to be?

560
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,358
You're a post-Corneal transplant
math teacher.

561
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:57,258
I deduced that you were
a blind math teacher.

562
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:59,692
I was an architect.

563
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,858
You gave up architecture
after you could see?

564
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,625
The world was ugly.

565
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:13,959
You think the world would be
any different

566
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:15,879
If your leg was fine?

567
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:18,425
No.

568
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:20,237
Think you'd be any different
if your leg was fine?

569
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,658
I mean, the doctors told me
that my life was gonna be

570
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:28,025
So much better
once i could see.

571
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:29,025
I would date,

572
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:31,222
I would dance,

573
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:34,391
But, uh, the guys
i hated dancing with before

574
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,025
I hate dancing with after.

575
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:38,491
My parents were still dead.

576
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:41,191
I was still alone.

577
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:43,391
You're fun.

578
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,892
You don't seem
all that different.

579
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:52,258
I haven't given up.

580
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:58,592
Wilson's got a new job,
hasn't started yet, but-

581
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,025
So who are we following?

582
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,825
See that lady up there?

583
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:03,325
You point at the target?

584
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:04,491
No, i'm following the one

585
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:05,725
Halfway in between that point

586
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,124
And that point.

587
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:12,124
Oh.
Pretty.

588
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:13,792
Who hired you?

589
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,224
No one.
I just like her.

590
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,025
You're stalking her?

591
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:19,725
No, no, i followed her out
of that bookstore back there.

592
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:23,658
You are stalking her,
just not for very long.

593
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:25,925
So what else can you tell me
that i might care about?

594
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:29,658
He attends this grief counseling
thing twice a week

595
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:30,658
Where they go around
the room

596
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:32,358
And cry about who's dead.

597
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,992
Cameron's been to his house
several times,

598
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,191
They just talk about death

599
00:26:37,258 --> 00:26:39,269
And losing loved ones.

600
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:52,224
What-

601
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,358
What are you-

602
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:55,792
If she turns her head,

603
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:58,124
She's gonna see that we're
walking the wrong direction.

604
00:26:58,191 --> 00:26:59,124
No, no, no,
she won't.

605
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:00,091
I'm very nondescript.

606
00:27:00,158 --> 00:27:01,358
Well, i'm not.

607
00:27:01,425 --> 00:27:02,825
Well, then you stay
four feet behind me.

608
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:04,725
How do you know
what they're talking about?

609
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:08,124
I'm in the same
grief counseling group.

610
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,325
I recently lost
my mother.

611
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:11,491
You'd get laid more often
if you told them

612
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:12,558
You lost a kid.

613
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,025
I didn't lose a kid.

614
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,758
You're a p.I.
Who can't lie?

615
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:17,025
I can lie.

616
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:19,391
I'm just not all that good
at it.

617
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:21,892
Well, dr. Cuddy's been over
to wilson's twice

618
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,291
And phoned
a bunch of times.

619
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:24,987
Foreman called him.

620
00:27:24,987 --> 00:27:27,291
And the rest of the time
wilson's been reading

621
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:30,558
Meditation books and magazines
about restoring barns.

622
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,059
Are you following me?

623
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:32,992
No.

624
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,091
Are you lying?

625
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:35,692
No.
Yes.

626
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:37,792
???Commit.

627
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,258
It's making me
uncomfortable.

628
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,758
Sorry.

629
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,758
You're very pretty.

630
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:47,091
More uncomfortable.

631
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:49,625
She's not your type.

632
00:27:49,692 --> 00:27:52,258
Your type is much stupider
than her.

633
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:53,758
What did wilson say
about me?

634
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:54,992
Oh, you've never come up.

635
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,625
In the grief counseling
or in the other-

636
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:00,025
Anywhere,
i got three bugs in his home

637
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:01,091
And one in his car.

638
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:02,358
If i didn't know you,

639
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:03,892
I wouldn't even know
you existed.

640
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,091
Which is good news.

641
00:28:06,158 --> 00:28:07,525
Only two things you ignore-

642
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:08,238
Things that aren't important

643
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:10,258
And things you wish
weren't important.

644
00:28:10,325 --> 00:28:12,625
And wishing never works.

645
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:27,491
She's better.

646
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:29,091
I can tell at once.

647
00:28:29,158 --> 00:28:30,992
Vomiting's a side effect
of the chemo.

648
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:33,391
Her heart rate's stabilized,
breathing's good.

649
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,558
Amylase and triglycerides
are both coming down.

650
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,325
I guess it's working.

651
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:39,692
Can't believe it.
It's cancer.

652
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:42,091
It's not cancer.

653
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:53,888
Labs show that our patient
is healthier.

654
00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:55,988
She's gonna get sicker.

655
00:28:56,055 --> 00:28:57,521
Then she's gonna die.

656
00:28:57,588 --> 00:28:59,222
I brought thal food.

657
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:00,521
What did you see in her?
Nothing.

658
00:29:00,588 --> 00:29:01,988
It's not cancer.

659
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:03,175
All the tests say
it's not cancer.

660
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,612
They've always said
it's not cancer.

661
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:06,588
Treatment proves
it's cancer.

662
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:08,255
Eh, treatment proves
it could be cancer.

663
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:09,421
It's not cancer.

664
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:10,925
This was your diagnosis.

665
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:11,816
I never thought
it was cancer.

666
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,504
You treated
for cancer.

667
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,071
I thought that what she had
acted like cancer.

668
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:17,605
If it acts like cancer,
maybe it'll respond like cancer.

669
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:18,971
It did.
'Cause it's cancer.

670
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:22,065
We have to find something
that walks like cancer,

671
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:23,037
Talks like cancer,

672
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:26,300
Tastes like cancer,
but isn't cancer.

673
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:26,971
No, we don't.

674
00:29:27,037 --> 00:29:28,925
Better is better.
Who cares why?

675
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:29,538
I do.

676
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:31,237
And so does tetrault.

677
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:32,784
Who?

678
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:34,550
The dead tuba player.

679
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,613
Tibalt.

680
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,946
The point is,
he died last,

681
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:39,113
But he died.

682
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,946
Which means
she's gonna die too.

683
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,780
Tibalt wasn't receiving
cancer medication.

684
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:43,913
There's a cancer drug

685
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,646
That's used off-Label
for arthritis.

686
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,047
There's no record
of arthritis.

687
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:48,913
Did you interview
all the tuba students?

688
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,813
If he had joint pain
in his hands,

689
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,813
He couldn't have played.

690
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,246
Then it wasn't in his hands.

691
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:53,246
Then why do we care
about his students?

692
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:54,713
One of them is canadian.

693
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,780
Brought him methotrexate
so he could hide his arthritis.

694
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,546
Already couldn't afford
his insurance.

695
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:02,680
And that little piece
of business cost me $700.

696
00:30:02,746 --> 00:30:04,880
I'm gonna pass it on to the
patient with a steep mark-Up.

697
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:06,546
This makes no sense.

698
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:08,546
I know.

699
00:30:08,613 --> 00:30:11,346
She's dead unless we can find
what's cancer...

700
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:13,546
But not cancer.

701
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:22,479
Something's missing.

702
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,513
I need an epiphany.

703
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,579
What are you billing
out at?

704
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:35,013
$300 an hour?

705
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,646
Here's four.

706
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:38,479
There are other oncologists.

707
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:39,579
Better oncologists.

708
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:40,909
But i need you.

709
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,913
Let me describe
the symptoms,

710
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,047
Problems, issues,

711
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,813
And say whatever
you feel like saying,

712
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,780
Until something triggers
an idea in my head.

713
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,080
That's not the way
it works.

714
00:30:54,147 --> 00:30:55,513
You have a way
of thinking about things.

715
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:57,479
It's sloppy,
it's undisciplined,

716
00:30:57,546 --> 00:30:59,013
It's not very linear.

717
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,479
It complements mine.

718
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:02,425
It drives me down avenues
that i wouldn't otherwise-

719
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,300
House, please go away.

720
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,487
Cancer, but not cancer.

721
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:08,813
Responds to cancer treatment,
but there's no-

722
00:31:14,913 --> 00:31:15,946
How are you?

723
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:18,246
Don't do this.

724
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:20,946
Please.

725
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,680
Don't do this.

726
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:24,846
I'm trying to move on.

727
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,579
By hanging out
with cameron,

728
00:31:28,646 --> 00:31:30,646
Talking to cuddy,
foreman,

729
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:31,846
But not me.

730
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:42,246
I paid a private investigator
to spy on you.

731
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:45,579
You didn't.

732
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:46,780
You want to move on from me,

733
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:48,113
You got to deal with me,
talk to me.

734
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,613
You had no right-

735
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,013
We're not friends anymore.

736
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,546
There's no trust
to be breached.

737
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:54,013
I can have you followed,

738
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,346
I can call you names,
tell your secrets.

739
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:01,546
Foreman did a ct.

740
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:03,980
Temporal and frontoparietal
regions are normal.

741
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,379
Occipital lobe, normal.

742
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:08,479
I have the right
to walk away from you, house.

743
00:32:08,546 --> 00:32:10,393
There's a world beyond you.

744
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:13,646
You need to realize that,
and even if you don't,

745
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:15,080
I'm moving on.

746
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:16,980
The next time you knock,

747
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:18,446
I'm not answering.

748
00:32:22,946 --> 00:32:24,550
Nothing yet.
Keep talking.

749
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,646
I'm sorry.

750
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:40,913
You charge me for listening in
on my own conversations?

751
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
Ha.
Yeah, why wouldn't i?

752
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:44,175
How many friends
do you have?

753
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:44,846
17.

754
00:32:44,913 --> 00:32:47,013
Seriously?

755
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,546
You have a list?

756
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:50,780
No, i knew this conversation
was really about you,

757
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,279
So i just gave you
an answer

758
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,413
So you could get back
to your train of thought.

759
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:55,446
Well done.

760
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:57,312
I have one.
Had one.

761
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:58,680
You know,
friends are important.

762
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:00,279
You're gonna miss-
Shut up.

763
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:03,680
Friends allow you to not sit
in a room by yourself.

764
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:04,680
Are you charging me
for this?

765
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:05,880
Are we friends?

766
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:07,479
No.
Then yes.

767
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:09,980
Do you wanna be
my friend?

768
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:11,312
No.
You scare me a little.

769
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:13,047
He thinks if he's not a friend,
he can't talk to me.

770
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:15,279
We can talk, we can be
two human beings talking-

771
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:16,446
I'm with him.

772
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:17,346
Sorry.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

773
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,513
Yes, you did.

774
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,746
I was in the middle
of a sentence.

775
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:22,479
Yes, i did.
You're repeating yourself.

776
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,646
I'm grateful.
Make your point.

777
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:25,713
It's like that
"cancer, but not cancer" thing

778
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,680
You were talking about
before.

779
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:27,780
Friends are friends,

780
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:29,446
Customers are customers,

781
00:33:29,513 --> 00:33:30,946
And everything else
is everything else.

782
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:33,680
If it's not,
nothing's nothing.

783
00:33:36,946 --> 00:33:39,237
And anything can be anything.

784
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:44,746
10:10. Stop the clock.
What?

785
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:48,479
The world is not as ugly
as she thinks it is.

786
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:55,988
Cancer, but not cancer.

787
00:33:57,815 --> 00:34:00,913
Doesn't make any sense
unless...

788
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,913
Brain, but not brain.

789
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,646
Occipital lobe's normal.

790
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:05,746
But her eyes suck.

791
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:07,413
That lobe should be
compensating.

792
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,312
Since it's not, that tells me
that something's in there

793
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,612
That shouldn't be in there.

794
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:14,346
Brain, but not brain.

795
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:15,379
Why are you
in my office?

796
00:34:15,446 --> 00:34:16,646
To find the anomaly,

797
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:18,880
I need to chop off
the top of her head.

798
00:34:18,946 --> 00:34:21,047
Pretty sure i need
your approval for that.

799
00:34:21,113 --> 00:34:23,980
I'm gonna trust
your first instinct.

800
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:26,579
I'm not usually confused
when you say things like that.

801
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:29,646
I'm ordering her cancer
treatment to be continued.

802
00:34:31,413 --> 00:34:34,413
Why does it cost $2,300
to fix a coffee machine?

803
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:36,813
Cancer stem cells
are real.

804
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,446
They explain everything.

805
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:40,080
They're like embryonic
stem cells.

806
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:40,946
They become whatever
they want.

807
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:41,946
Donor had them,

808
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,613
The recipients got them.

809
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,746
They floated around,
they landed on an organ,

810
00:34:45,813 --> 00:34:48,212
Got bathed in cytomes
and partially differentiated.

811
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:49,813
And the key word there
is partially.

812
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,946
In the tuba player,
they became lung, but not lung.

813
00:34:53,013 --> 00:34:54,913
In the tennis player, they
became heart, but not heart.

814
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,880
Stop me if you've figured out
the pattern.

815
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:58,113
They looked as if they belonged,

816
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,246
But they weren't doing
their jobs.

817
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:00,080
And when they were
really needed,

818
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:01,613
Boom.

819
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,880
Chemo worked because cells
are basically tumors.

820
00:35:04,946 --> 00:35:06,315
Chemo shrunk them.

821
00:35:09,394 --> 00:35:10,846
You're still gonna say no,
aren't you?

822
00:35:10,913 --> 00:35:11,913
You've no proof.

823
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,279
I have the brain scan.

824
00:35:13,346 --> 00:35:14,946
The normal brain scan.

825
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,980
This is why
i need to take off her head.

826
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:18,513
Treat or to prove
you're right?

827
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:20,080
To treat.

828
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:22,346
Chemo's not killing
anything.

829
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:23,780
It's just hiding
the real problem.

830
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:24,913
She's gonna crash.

831
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,646
If we wait
until she does crash,

832
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:28,179
It might be too late.

833
00:35:28,246 --> 00:35:31,446
So the next step is what?

834
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:32,680
I say no, and then
you do something

835
00:35:32,746 --> 00:35:34,246
To make her crash

836
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:36,546
So that i'll think
you've proven your theory?

837
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:37,780
I would never do that.

838
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,300
No, you won't.

839
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,300
* to change the world *

840
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,488
* start with one step *

841
00:36:07,013 --> 00:36:09,613
* however small *

842
00:36:11,312 --> 00:36:14,112
* the first step
is hardest of all *

843
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:18,862
* once you get your gait *

844
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,300
* you'll be walking tall *

845
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,800
* you said you never did *

846
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:32,800
* 'cause you might die tryin' *

847
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,190
* 'cause you *

848
00:36:44,513 --> 00:36:47,612
* if you close your eyes *

849
00:36:49,113 --> 00:36:51,878
* because the house is on fire *

850
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:56,815
* and think you couldn't move *

851
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:01,410
* until the fire dies *

852
00:37:03,212 --> 00:37:04,379
* the things you never did *

853
00:37:04,446 --> 00:37:06,488
She's crashing!

854
00:37:07,746 --> 00:37:10,628
* 'cause you might die tryin' *

855
00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:14,550
* 'cause you might
die tryin' * *

856
00:37:44,246 --> 00:37:46,979
You might want to check
her iv.

857
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:52,737
From here, it looks like saline
instead of chemo.

858
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,987
Yeah, they look identical.

859
00:37:54,987 --> 00:37:56,887
Still.
You should probably check.

860
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:01,688
You switched
her meds?

861
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:03,655
How could i?
I had no access.

862
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:05,288
Close her back up.

863
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:06,455
Do the surgery.

864
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,388
There's no reason to-

865
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:09,822
No reason not to.

866
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,054
The stupidly dangerous part
is already over with.

867
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:15,054
We're ready
with the neural net.

868
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:38,488
Is that someone's brain?

869
00:38:38,555 --> 00:38:40,487
Except for the part
that isn't brain.

870
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:47,822
Hey, that's the patient i-

871
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:51,588
You said
she'd be fine.

872
00:38:51,655 --> 00:38:53,154
I'm a better liar
than you are.

873
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:55,388
I swapped her meds.

874
00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:56,388
I mean, she's got
a brain problem.

875
00:38:56,455 --> 00:38:57,555
I coulda killed her.

876
00:38:57,621 --> 00:38:59,455
Yup.

877
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:00,954
The neural net will show us

878
00:39:01,021 --> 00:39:03,455
How fast
her neurons are firing.

879
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:04,854
If there's something
in the way,

880
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:07,588
Say...
brain that's not brain,

881
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:09,854
The normal neural impulses
will be sucked

882
00:39:09,921 --> 00:39:11,088
Into a vortex

883
00:39:11,154 --> 00:39:13,822
Because they're not able
to do their job.

884
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:15,154
The computer
will then process it

885
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:16,388
And give us a picture
of where to cut.

886
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,621
Cool.

887
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:20,822
Excuse me?

888
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:22,588
Sorry, i thought
that's what you wanted to hear.

889
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:26,154
You think all this
is amazingly cool.

890
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:30,455
And you have no one else, so
you're paying a guy to listen.

891
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:33,887
Sorry-Just trying to save you
some cash.

892
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,154
I'm on the clock.

893
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:36,355
Yeah, why wouldn't you be?

894
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:38,190
You think
this is interesting to me?

895
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,254
House?

896
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:41,887
I see it.

897
00:39:41,954 --> 00:39:42,887
Can you get it?

898
00:39:42,954 --> 00:39:44,288
I think so.

899
00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:46,854
Turns out
you didn't kill her.

900
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:50,655
Cool.
You owe me $5,000.

901
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:08,887
Why are you just standing there,
dr. House?

902
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:13,887
How'd you know
who it is?

903
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:17,987
I can smell you.

904
00:40:18,054 --> 00:40:20,555
Yeah, like you're
a field of roses.

905
00:40:25,854 --> 00:40:27,288
Peppermint tea.

906
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:29,921
You ever hear
of the boy who cried wolf?

907
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:32,566
Never really bought that.

908
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:34,488
I don't care
how often a kid cries,

909
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:36,941
He's being eaten by a wolf,
mom's gonna come running.

910
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:44,921
The world is ugly.

911
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:46,221
People kill.

912
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:49,288
They go hungry.

913
00:40:52,688 --> 00:40:54,112
Just proving a point.

914
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:01,254
People are asses.

915
00:41:01,321 --> 00:41:02,788
Why are you telling me
this stuff?

916
00:41:02,854 --> 00:41:04,121
Because the world
is not as ugly

917
00:41:04,188 --> 00:41:05,555
As you think it is.

918
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:08,987
Your transplanted cornea's fine,
your eye is fine,

919
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:12,154
But your brain
wasn't working right.

920
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,455
I'm gonna take
the gauze off your eyes now.

921
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:16,655
It's gonna be bright.
I know.

922
00:41:16,722 --> 00:41:19,688
The brain cells
that weren't brain cells

923
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:24,154
Were in the way of processing
visual information correctly.

924
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:25,621
After the transplant,
you could see,

925
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:26,987
But not see.

926
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:28,121
I could see.

927
00:41:28,188 --> 00:41:29,355
I could read.

928
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:33,021
Yeah, but it was dull,
or foggy, or gray.

929
00:41:33,088 --> 00:41:34,488
I don't know.

930
00:41:34,555 --> 00:41:37,221
What i do know
is that yowere not seeing

931
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:38,321
What everyone else
was seeing.

932
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:40,188
And now?

933
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:45,088
Things are gonna be...
beautiful?

934
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:47,655
Things'll be
what they are.

935
00:42:07,921 --> 00:42:10,488
How do i look?

936
00:42:14,987 --> 00:42:16,455
You look sad.

937
00:42:38,854 --> 00:42:41,021
Hey.

938
00:42:41,088 --> 00:42:43,722
Is there any way
i could put you on retainer?

939
00:42:43,723 --> 00:42:44,723
