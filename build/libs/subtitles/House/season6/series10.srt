1
00:00:01,109 --> 00:00:03,344
So I'm thinking 35.

2
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:05,579
Seems high to me.

3
00:00:05,646 --> 00:00:09,816
That's a fair price for quality like this.

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:10,851
I'll give you 30.

5
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:16,723
What? I thought you were joking.

6
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,125
I didn't...

7
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:19,626
Who am I dealing with here, eddie?

8
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:20,660
Him or you?

9
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:21,928
Mickey, relax.

10
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:24,965
Now, if things move forward with gorski,

11
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:26,299
He lets us into philly,

12
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:27,701
Then maybe I cut you a break.

13
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:29,603
You cut me a break now,

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,171
Or maybe you don't get with gorski.

15
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:36,710
Marco...

16
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:38,812
I thought we had an understanding.

17
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:41,448
Whoa, whoa.

18
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:43,517
Tommy, don't be stupid. Put the gun down.

19
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:45,318
First, he shows you some respect.

20
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:47,387
Hey, you just-- just listen to your boss,

21
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:48,622
All right, moron?

22
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:49,589
You shut up!

23
00:00:49,657 --> 00:00:51,591
Just relax, buddy.

24
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,763
agh!

25
00:00:56,831 --> 00:00:59,032
<i>Oh, god!</i>

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,634
What the hell were you thinking?

27
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:02,369
I didn't shoot him! Are you sure?

28
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:03,803
<i>Look at him. He's face-down on the
pavement!</i>

29
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:05,138
I nailed myself in the foot!

30
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:06,239
God!

31
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:12,379
I--I don't think he's hit.

32
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:13,413
Then what happened?

33
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:14,481
Let's get outta here!

34
00:01:16,217 --> 00:01:17,284
Come on, mickey, wake up.

35
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:19,286
mickey! Wake up!

36
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:35,101
* *

37
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:57,390
We almost done here?

38
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:01,294
Assuming you did this
shaving your forehead...

39
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:02,395
Okay, then.

40
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:04,097
<i>I'm ordering a head c.T.</i>

41
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,333
No, I don't have a headache. I'm not dizzy.

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,367
Eddie, I gotta get back.

43
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:09,035
You gotta stay here.

44
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:11,638
<i>We'll straighten out that mess
with marco tomorrow.</i>

45
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:13,740
Let the doc do his job.

46
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:15,141
Actually, stitching you up

47
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,943
Is really the e.R. Doc's job.

48
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,845
Yeah.

49
00:02:18,913 --> 00:02:20,213
Too long of a wait.

50
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:24,918
Yeah. Also, a lot of cops in the e.R.

51
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:26,052
Not that you care about that.

52
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,055
So how did this happen?

53
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:34,861
Yeah, you're right.
That was a stupid question.

54
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:36,863
'cause the answer's kind of obvious.

55
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:38,732
No scrapes on your hands

56
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,033
Means you didn't try to break your fall.

57
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:42,068
Means either out cold

58
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:44,371
Or totally disoriented when you went down.

59
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:46,473
No sign of trauma other than the cut

60
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,575
<i>Means no one hit you in the head.</i>

61
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:50,076
<i>Powder burn on your jacket sleeve</i>

62
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:52,312
Means someone shot a gun.

63
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:57,884
All right, eddie. Come on, let's go.

64
00:02:57,952 --> 00:02:59,953
I don't care what you guys are into.

65
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:00,987
If you don't get this checked out,

66
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,289
It'll happen again.

67
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:04,958
Whoa. What will?

68
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:05,925
This.

69
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,834
Cool.

70
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:17,604
32-year-old man,

71
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:20,073
Recent developed loud-noise-induced vertigo.

72
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,309
C.T. Was clean.

73
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:23,643
<i>No internal bleeding, no edema.</i>

74
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:25,145
Everything else is in the file.

75
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:27,380
Cameron get your hair in the divorce?

76
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:29,816
<i>This guy strained his back three years
ago.</i>

77
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,084
And that's it.

78
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:32,919
All the rest of these pages are blank.

79
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:34,487
Yes, he won't tell us anything.

80
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:37,490
Understandable, since he's a drug dealer.

81
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:40,393
So he's dangerous and withholding,

82
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:42,128
<i>Which you find irresistible.</i>

83
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:44,397
But guys like that, they never call.

84
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:46,433
<i>he actually said he was
a drug dealer?</i>

85
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,134
Not out loud.

86
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:50,470
<i>But he was wearing a solid
gold patek philippe.</i>

87
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:52,238
<i>His friend had a rolex.</i>

88
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:54,074
<i>But their phones were
prepaid burners,</i>

89
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:55,775
So they can toss 'em as
soon as they're done.

90
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:57,110
<i>it doesn't matter</i>

91
00:03:57,178 --> 00:03:58,345
<i>If this guy's a drug dealer or not.</i>

92
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,547
Noise-induced vertigo means ear or brain.

93
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:01,748
Head ct was clean,

94
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:03,016
So I'm thinking acoustic neuroma.

95
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:04,984
We need to do an a.B.R. To test his hearing.

96
00:04:05,052 --> 00:04:06,386
Acoustic neuroma fits.

97
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,421
So does lidocaine toxicity.

98
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,824
Or benzocaine--depends what
he's cutting the coke with.

99
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:12,125
So now he's not just a drug dealer,

100
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:13,259
He's a cocaine dealer.

101
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:14,627
He seemed peppy.

102
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:16,496
You test his ears.

103
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:18,231
I'm gonna go test his cocaine.

104
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,566
You think this guy's just gonna hand over

105
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:21,334
A briefcase full of illegal drugs

106
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:22,635
<i>Because you ask nicely?</i>

107
00:04:22,703 --> 00:04:24,003
I hope not.

108
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:31,111
So the best coffee's at geena's,

109
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:33,346
And the best pizza is at gino's.

110
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:34,948
Yeah, and don't mix those up,

111
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:37,450
Because the coffee at gino's could kill ya.

112
00:04:37,518 --> 00:04:39,252
And how's the drycleaner on the corner?

113
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,754
Go two blocks over to eco-clean.

114
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:42,088
The one on the corner

115
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,323
Used to shred all my boyfriend's shirts.

116
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,492
Good to know.

117
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:48,795
In retrospect, I should
really thank those cleaners.

118
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:50,296
We broke up.

119
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:51,698
This is my stop.

120
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:52,932
So if you have any more questions

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,434
About the neighborhood,

122
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,468
I'm your girl.

123
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:57,370
Uh, favorite sushi place.

124
00:04:57,438 --> 00:04:59,372
Maybe we could get dinner sometime.

125
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,509
Sure...If you promise to
bring that good-looking guy

126
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:03,643
With the cane.

127
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:05,645
You mean house?

128
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:07,480
Your boyfriend's name is house?

129
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:11,117
H-he's not my boyfriend.

130
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,252
Oh...

131
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,586
Heh, I'm sorry.

132
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:15,955
Wh-what do you call each other?

133
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:17,457
Husband? Partner?

134
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,092
<i>Lover?</i>

135
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,794
We're not gay.

136
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:22,762
Seriously?

137
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,100
You're gonna hear a series
of clicks and hisses.

138
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:29,169
Sensors measure electronic activity

139
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:30,804
To your auditory nerve.

140
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,739
How long is this gonna take?

141
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:35,675
An hour, maybe an hour and a half.

142
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:39,946
Or you could walk away
with a tumor in your ear.

143
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:43,850
Guy's probably late to a stabbing.

144
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:45,185
Impedances look good.

145
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:48,555
Starting at 13 clicks per
second at 50 decibels.

146
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:49,522
Check this out.

147
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,761
13's middle name is beauregard?

148
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:57,530
Wave three latency is 3.8.

149
00:05:57,598 --> 00:05:59,933
Slightly delayed, but nothing significant.

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,034
That's what sticks out to you?

151
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,002
House is clearly screwing with us.

152
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,304
It's a fake paystub.

153
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,605
Looks real to me.

154
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:07,240
There's no way she makes that much money.

155
00:06:07,308 --> 00:06:08,942
I make that much money.

156
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:15,381
And...Apparently, you don't.

157
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,584
I need the drugs.

158
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:19,919
We're in textiles.

159
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:23,690
I need the drugs!

160
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:25,458
Hmm...Works for jack bauer.

161
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:27,927
Is this really necessary?

162
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:30,530
The chairs in the hall
are way more comfortable.

163
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,665
But way less genre-apopriate.

164
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,767
<i>Okay, here's the deal.</i>

165
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:36,035
I need information.

166
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:37,937
You have reasons not to
give me that information.

167
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:41,841
So either I can force it out of you...

168
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,777
Or I can't.

169
00:06:44,845 --> 00:06:47,647
I wish I could tell ya.

170
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:50,717
Okay...Well, let's work with that.

171
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:53,453
Forget the drugs. Let's talk about textiles.

172
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:55,088
What's your major product?

173
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,723
Is it "h"?

174
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,558
And by that I mean "hosiery."

175
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:02,328
We do more with...

176
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:03,429
Culottes.

177
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:04,864
Is that with a "c" or a "k"?

178
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:06,032
"c."

179
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,634
Nobody wants "k" anymore.

180
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:09,736
Does your friend cuthe thfae fabr

181
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:11,938
No, he's a sales guy.

182
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:14,474
Well, he must cut a culotte here and there.

183
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:17,076
No one touches the culottes.

184
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:20,280
I'm sorry.

185
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:21,180
Can I talk to you for a second?

186
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:24,951
I'm interrogating a suspect.

187
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,586
Make it quick.

188
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:32,091
Everyone in our building thinks we're gay.

189
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:38,231
We're grown men over the age of 30

190
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:39,699
Who moved in together.

191
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,035
We're two tigers away from an act in vegas.

192
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:44,203
They'll figure out we're
straight eventually.

193
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:45,705
Eventually is not when I want to go out

194
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:47,507
With the cute girl in 3-b.

195
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:50,043
Any chance I could get some water over here?

196
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,344
If only there was some way

197
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:53,413
To communicate that information to her.

198
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,248
Perhaps using, I don't know, sounds.

199
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:57,350
<i>If only the larynx was capable of--</i>

200
00:07:57,418 --> 00:07:58,651
She didn't believe me.

201
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,154
She sidestepped my dinner invite.

202
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,356
<i>And a woman would only reject you</i>

203
00:08:03,424 --> 00:08:04,624
<i>Because she's worried</i>

204
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,159
That you might not be interested in her.

205
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:07,760
We were chatting, having fun.

206
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,162
There was definitely a spark.

207
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:11,297
When she thought you were gay.

208
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,466
You sure your friend isn't secretly tr--

209
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,735
What is a culotte, anyway?

210
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,004
Pants that hang like a skirt.

211
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:20,974
Just...

212
00:08:22,743 --> 00:08:24,210
Mickey hates the stuff.

213
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:26,679
<i>He's one of the few guys I trust</i>

214
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:29,182
To watch the product overnight.

215
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:32,151
<i>They took him away an hour ago.</i>

216
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,453
You think he's okay?

217
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,787
It's an ear test.

218
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:36,389
Pretty sure he'll live.

219
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,361
Pupils are constricted. Pulse is bounding!

220
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:43,162
airway's clear.

221
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,697
Need a crash cart in here!

222
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:45,898
Gotta be his blood pressure.

223
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:47,667
We need to get it down
before he strokes out!

224
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,235
At least we know his ears are okay.

225
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,168
We put the patient on vasodilators,

226
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:53,836
Got his hypertension under control.

227
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:55,604
He got worse here at the hospital.

228
00:08:55,672 --> 00:08:58,774
Means thug life probably
isn't what's making him sick.

229
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:01,043
Which means we can stop the
bloodhound gang routine

230
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:02,411
And go back to being doctors.

231
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,246
But we're doctors all the time.

232
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:06,084
It's so boring.

233
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:10,086
Fine.

234
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,120
Could be sick sinus syndrome.

235
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:12,789
No chest pain, shortness of breath.

236
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:16,025
<i>Brain aneurysm secondary to
polycystic kidney disease?</i>

237
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:17,360
<i>normal urinalysis.</i>

238
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:18,528
Kidney's impalpable.

239
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:21,397
Is...That a new watch?

240
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:24,067
Thought I'd give myself a little treat.

241
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:25,134
<i>What if it's not his brain,</i>

242
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:26,135
But it's on the way to his brain?

243
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:27,337
Carotid stenosis.

244
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:30,673
Get an ultrasound of his carotids.

245
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:32,542
See if his arteries are clogged.

246
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,151
How much money do you make?

247
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,455
I want a raise.

248
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:48,057
And I will be happy to talk about that

249
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,026
<i>At your next review... In August.</i>

250
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:51,594
I know that you're paying me

251
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:53,296
<i>Less than everyone else on the team.</i>

252
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:54,564
I can't discuss other people's salaries.

253
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:56,032
You know that.

254
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Now that they know I'm
making less than they are,

255
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,334
They'll never respect me.

256
00:09:58,402 --> 00:09:59,936
And who told them how much you make?

257
00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:02,972
It's not fair for me to make less

258
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,207
Than the people I supervise.

259
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:06,309
Salary isn't about fairness.

260
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:08,845
It's about what you can
leverage in negotiation.

261
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:11,981
Which isn't much without a
competing offer on the table.

262
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,449
And we both know you don't have one.

263
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:19,655
Ultrasound showed no narrowing

264
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:21,524
Or obstruction in the patient's carotid.

265
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:23,893
-Not that he's worried-
-keeps asking me when he can leave.

266
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:26,095
<i>a place in the business of healing
people,</i>

267
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:27,030
<i>You'd think they'd have better chicken
soup.</i>

268
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:28,865
You bugged his room?

269
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:29,866
Our patient sleeps in the building

270
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,501
Where they keep their stash.

271
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:32,769
Eventually, he'll say something

272
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:34,904
That gives away where that is.

273
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:36,439
And we'll find out what's making him sick.

274
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:38,307
But we ruled out environmental causes.

275
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,243
<i>You ruled out environmental causes.</i>

276
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,911
<i>and you pretended to agree,</i>

277
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,746
<i>Just so we'd take him out of his room</i>

278
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:45,615
So you could plant the bug.

279
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:47,417
Carotid stenosis was a decent idea.

280
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:50,219
But an even decent-er idea

281
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:52,288
Is that he's got toxins
stored in his fat cells.

282
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:54,257
Every calorie he burns makes him sicker.

283
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:55,858
<i>If we're going with toxic exposure,</i>

284
00:10:55,926 --> 00:10:58,795
We should just start testing
for the most likely suspects.

285
00:10:58,862 --> 00:10:59,962
Bug's a better idea

286
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,731
Than blindly running tests for days.

287
00:11:05,602 --> 00:11:07,170
Tell him it'll take weeks.

288
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:10,773
It'll be faster.

289
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:11,808
What do you mean weeks?

290
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,209
These tests take time.

291
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:15,344
There are a lot of possibilities.

292
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:17,280
No, but I--I can't sit here this long.

293
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:19,382
I got things I gotta take care of.

294
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,917
If you're worried about all
the poor school children

295
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,518
Going without their drugs,

296
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:23,519
<i>I'm sure someone--</i>

297
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:24,954
I wanna be discharged.

298
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:27,890
I'll get the forms.

299
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:44,340
<i>this is ridiculous.</i>

300
00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:45,508
Beats sitting in a lab all day.

301
00:11:45,576 --> 00:11:46,843
In the lab,

302
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,512
There is significantly less
chance of getting killed.

303
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,646
<i>You're too close. Slow down.</i>

304
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:51,547
<i>We're in a car in broad daylight.</i>

305
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:52,915
What's gonna happen?

306
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,283
You honestly think he doesn't
have a gun in that car?

307
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:55,718
That he's gonna use to shoot doctors?

308
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:57,954
Just...Back off.

309
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,693
Hey, well played with the watch, by the way.

310
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,194
Borrowed it from a friend.

311
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:06,662
How much longer are we
gonna keep lying to him?

312
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,231
Until it's no longer fun.

313
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,534
We all thought he needed to be taken down

314
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:12,768
A few notches.

315
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:15,271
So we're just having fun, not getting even?

316
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:17,707
Oh, crap.

317
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:18,541
<i>whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

318
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:19,475
He's gonna get away.

319
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:29,752
Shut up.

320
00:12:37,094 --> 00:12:38,261
3-b?

321
00:12:38,328 --> 00:12:40,263
You're nora, right?

322
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,998
My roommate tells me you're the one to thank

323
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,466
For all the tips about the neighborhood.

324
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:45,434
Greg. Nice to meet you.

325
00:12:47,871 --> 00:12:49,405
I hear you thought that wilson and I

326
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:51,107
Liked to polish each other's swords.

327
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:55,378
And by swords, I mean pistols.

328
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:57,380
Of course he told you about that.

329
00:12:57,447 --> 00:12:58,848
Oh, don't worry.

330
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,384
Actually, I'm surprised that
doesn't happen more often.

331
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:03,386
We're both straight.

332
00:13:09,826 --> 00:13:12,728
Oh, my...God.

333
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:14,997
<i>That is beautiful.</i>

334
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:16,666
We finally have the room

335
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,067
To display it the way it deserves.

336
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:23,472
Would you--would you help
me get this upstairs?

337
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,141
Absolutely.

338
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:29,145
Nice shoes, by the way.

339
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:30,947
Louboutin?

340
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:32,548
You talk to cuddy?

341
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:33,883
Shot me down.

342
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:35,818
So, uh, what are you gonna do now?

343
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:37,086
I'll wait for my review in August.

344
00:13:37,154 --> 00:13:39,755
Oh.

345
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:41,123
What?

346
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:42,258
Nothing.

347
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:44,126
That's what I would do.

348
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:45,861
But I'm a coward.

349
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,404
His friend brought him in 15 minutes ago.

350
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:57,006
<i>Temp's 105.</i>

351
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:58,241
Pulse is weak and thready.

352
00:13:58,308 --> 00:13:59,942
He's not making any sense.

353
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,010
It's too much money, eddie.

354
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:02,111
That wasn't the deal.

355
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,646
That wasn't the deal.

356
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:04,780
Is he gonna be okay?

357
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:05,848
Eddie!

358
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:10,018
<i>we gave him antipyretics
and soft steroids</i>

359
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:12,119
<i>To reduce the fever and
prevent organ damage.</i>

360
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:13,654
He's no longer delirious.

361
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,456
Patient went out,
came back worse than before.

362
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:16,524
Points us back to environmental,

363
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:17,858
<i>Tied to wherever he went.</i>

364
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:18,893
No, it doesn't.

365
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,927
Where's foreman?

366
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:21,429
He had a meeting with cuddy.

367
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:22,997
<i>What do you mean, "no, it doesn't"?</i>

368
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:24,231
We screwed up the tail.
My car was impounded.

369
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:25,266
<i>True,</i>

370
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,101
Amusing, and irrelevant.

371
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:29,637
Foreman fall for the paycheck thing?

372
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,908
Uh, yeah.

373
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:35,543
Mazel tov.

374
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,811
Should be fun to watch.

375
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,680
You're off environmental?

376
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:40,681
Wherever he went,

377
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:41,982
It wasn't for long enough.

378
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,318
Add in the fever and
infection's way more likely.

379
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:45,686
And if it is an infection,

380
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,955
His symptomsuggest it's moved to his brain.

381
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:50,191
Which means...

382
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:51,592
We'll do a lumbar puncture.

383
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:57,331
Next time you're tailing someone,

384
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,401
Take two cars.

385
00:15:00,469 --> 00:15:02,136
You knew we were following you?

386
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:05,673
I'm sorry. I had to lose you.

387
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,608
I had business to take care of.

388
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:10,711
Right, because you're a businessman.

389
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:12,680
<i>Do you know how many junkies</i>

390
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,548
Come into the e.R. Every week
with their brains melting?

391
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:16,684
I'll bet there's more drunks
with their livers giving out.

392
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:18,285
<i>A liquor store owner</i>

393
00:15:18,353 --> 00:15:19,620
Laying on this table--

394
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:20,788
I'm guessing he doesn't get attitude.

395
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:22,056
Aah!

396
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:23,491
I hit bone.

397
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:24,792
<i>His old back injury</i>

398
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,694
<i>Must have flattened out his discs.</i>

399
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:28,462
Sorry, but I've got to try this again.

400
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,597
You okay? Yeah.

401
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:31,365
<i>An adult wants to get wasted,</i>

402
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:34,401
Why is it anybody's business
what substance they use?

403
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:37,104
Because some of those
substances are against the law.

404
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:40,274
So your problem isn't that it's immoral.

405
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:42,610
Your problem is that it's illegal.

406
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,514
I got the same problem.

407
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,249
<i>I'm in.</i>

408
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,554
Look at his heart rate.

409
00:15:53,622 --> 00:15:54,555
It's normal.

410
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,756
I know.

411
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:02,363
I ran into nora this morning.

412
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,466
<i>She told me about your evita
listening party.</i>

413
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:09,904
The london and new york
recordings are so different.

414
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:12,406
You were supposed to tell
her that we're straight.

415
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:14,642
She didn't believe me, either.

416
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,344
You're doing this to mess with me.

417
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:19,380
Correction--I started doing
this to mess with you.

418
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:21,815
Now I'm hostly trying to hit that.

419
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:23,417
By pretending you're gay

420
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:25,019
And in a relationship with me?

421
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:27,388
We're in a relationship
and we're really unhappy.

422
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:29,023
Communication's never been easy for us.

423
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,658
Probably 'cause we're so closeted.

424
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:32,226
<i>I got it all figured out.</i>

425
00:16:32,294 --> 00:16:33,761
<i>Nora and I spend the next few weeks</i>

426
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:34,895
Hanging out,

427
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:36,297
Become best girlfriends.

428
00:16:36,364 --> 00:16:38,566
I confide in her about our issues.

429
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,434
I can't decide if this plan

430
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:43,404
Is more despicable or illogical.

431
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:45,906
Then, one night, we get drunk...

432
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:48,209
Back rub turns into a front rub...

433
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:49,743
<i>The next morning,</i>

434
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:52,046
"I've never felt this way
about a woman before."

435
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:54,481
That's...Quite a commitment you've made

436
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,650
To jumping the girl I'd like to date.

437
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:58,352
I'd like to date her.

438
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,688
In the sense that I'd like
to jump her repeatedly.

439
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,122
I saw her first.

440
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,825
Seriously? You're invoking the guy code?

441
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:06,961
We're guys. It's a code.

442
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:08,562
You're only bringing this up

443
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,798
'cause you know you're gonna lose.

444
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,600
It's not an infection,

445
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,336
But it might be an autonomic nerve disorder.

446
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:17,204
The hair is still bumping me.

447
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:18,472
Did you get it cut

448
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,873
Because you're ready for
the next chapter or--

449
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:22,409
We stuck a needle into
his spinal bodies twice.

450
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:24,211
<i>His heart rate stayed normal.</i>

451
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,213
<i>If we add that to his
other symptoms...</i>

452
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:28,649
That would be a mistake.

453
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:31,719
She's never gonna fall for it.

454
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:33,320
Well, then, you got nothing
to worry about, sweetie.

455
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,960
You're a wuss.

456
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,264
Say that when I'm better.

457
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:45,132
What, are you gonna beat me up?

458
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,533
That sounds stressful.

459
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:49,536
Maybe you should pop one of
your beta blockers first.

460
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:51,505
You have a heart problem?

461
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:52,973
Medically, no.

462
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,408
He would have told us about that.

463
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:56,010
Metaphorically...

464
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:09,723
It's an effect from operating
outside of the law.

465
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,193
Sometimes, I have to do bad things.

466
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,728
And not always to bad people.

467
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:17,031
Last few months,

468
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:19,833
That hasn't been so easy.

469
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:21,302
A guy got me the pills.

470
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:24,338
<i>And they control the stress.</i>

471
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:26,707
Look, don't-- don't say anything to eddie.

472
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:27,741
<i>All right?</i>

473
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,176
The last thing I need

474
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:31,378
Is the guys thinking that I've gone soft.

475
00:18:31,446 --> 00:18:32,579
When was your last pill

476
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:33,781
Before we originally admitted you?

477
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:36,016
Um, the night before.

478
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:37,885
And we stuck you in here,

479
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:39,520
And you went into beta blocker withdrawal.

480
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:41,221
That's what caused the hypertension.

481
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:42,856
When he got out of here,
he took another pill,

482
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:44,091
And the hypertension went away.

483
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:45,459
Which means it was never a symptom.

484
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:46,727
We take that off the table,

485
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:48,529
We've got vertigo, fever...

486
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:49,763
<i>And stress.</i>

487
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,298
He's been in this game for a while.

488
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:53,734
Either he grew a conscience
over the last few months

489
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:55,869
Or he's producing excess adrenaline.

490
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:58,272
Pheochromocytoma.

491
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,407
What? It's greek for,

492
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:01,608
"you'll be back doing bad
things to good people

493
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:02,576
In no time."

494
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:04,978
M.R.I. His adrenal glands.

495
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:06,246
You're okay with that, right?

496
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:07,781
You're not gonna put a pillow over his face?

497
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:14,555
Oh, great.

498
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:17,358
Cable guy came.

499
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:18,926
you know what? It's going good.

500
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,694
<i>How about I just learn to keep
people out of our business?</i>

501
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:21,829
<i>And that's the real thing.</i>

502
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:23,130
Hello.

503
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:24,698
Hi, james.

504
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,800
We've got some kung pao left.

505
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:30,637
Oh! God. Right there.

506
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:32,072
<i>Oh. Oh.</i>

507
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,309
We're having a picnic... With wine.

508
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:36,510
I'll pour you a glass.

509
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:37,711
He doesn't drink.

510
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,847
Oh. Well, more for us, then.

511
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:45,252
Well...

512
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,553
I think I might...

513
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:49,990
Have a little...

514
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:02,980
How'd it go with cuddy?

515
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:07,685
She told me I needed leverage.
So, I told her about an offer I had

516
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:09,453
to help run the neuro department at mercy.

517
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:13,057
Wow.

518
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,792
Are you really gonna take the job?

519
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,827
There is no other job.

520
00:20:16,895 --> 00:20:18,930
I bluffed. She called it.

521
00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:21,365
I'm not gonna beg to be underpaid.

522
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,868
I'm leaving when this case is over.

523
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:30,074
House is lying to you.

524
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:31,442
I know.

525
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,110
And so are you.

526
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:35,246
It's 2010, I mean...

527
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:37,348
You know, nobody cares
if you're gay anymore.

528
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,817
I mean, you don't have to be in the closet.

529
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,086
I'm not, I...

530
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:43,254
Look around you.

531
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:44,755
Does this really look like a place

532
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:46,057
Gay men live?

533
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:48,826
A-apart from the poster.

534
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:50,394
Those stools are our only furniture.

535
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:52,630
There are no window treatments.

536
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:54,765
Well, my ex-boyfriend didn't even know

537
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,434
What window treatments were.

538
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,371
Is that greg's carpenters album or yours?

539
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,374
Look, house hates musicals and fashion

540
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:04,475
And meringue.

541
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,510
This whole thing is an act

542
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:10,514
Designed to earn your trust...

543
00:21:10,582 --> 00:21:13,184
In order to sleep with you.

544
00:21:14,953 --> 00:21:15,987
I get it.

545
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:17,588
Finally.

546
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:18,990
You're jealous.

547
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:21,559
You know, if you want to
spend more time with greg,

548
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:24,261
U should just tell him.

549
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,501
<i>you were wrong.</i>

550
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:32,603
M.R.I. Revealed no sign
of a pheochromocytoma,

551
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:33,504
Which means mickey's stress

552
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:34,705
Is just stress.

553
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:36,207
We're back to vertigo and fever.

554
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:37,441
<i>And environmental is back at the top</i>

555
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:38,809
Of our list of suspects.

556
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:40,144
We're trying to narrow
down the possibilities.

557
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:42,113
That receiver doesn't respond
to manual stimulation.

558
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,181
Maybe if you took off your shirt.

559
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,050
Actually, I resorted to
something more exotic.

560
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:48,185
I call it reading the instructions.

561
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:50,221
Turns out if you screw the antennae

562
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:51,655
Into the wrong sockets,

563
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:54,692
<i>It doesn't actually work.</i>

564
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,694
We lost mickey just outside trenton.

565
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,069
It's supposed to search
for an open frequency.

566
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:06,871
Most buildings there were built

567
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:08,506
Between 1920 and 1940.

568
00:22:08,573 --> 00:22:10,074
We're compiling a list
of toxins most common--

569
00:22:10,142 --> 00:22:11,909
There's got to be at
least one open frequency.

570
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,951
I need a few minutes with your friend.

571
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:24,655
Or stay if you want.

572
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:27,658
Rectal exam.

573
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:29,360
I'll check out the cafeteria.

574
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:39,770
Why the beta blockers?

575
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:42,373
What do you mean?

576
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:45,543
Valium and xanax actually reduce stress.

577
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,079
Beta blockers just control
the symptoms of stress.

578
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:49,080
Whoa.

579
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:50,147
Keep the heart from racing,

580
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:51,382
Hands from shaking,

581
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,484
And all those stage fright issues.

582
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:57,688
That's why some people take
them when they perform.

583
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:00,624
What the hell is that?

584
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:02,793
This is my bug.

585
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:04,528
And this...

586
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:05,863
Um... This...

587
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:09,266
This is yours.

588
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:13,304
You bugged your own room?

589
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:15,873
Are you...An informant?

590
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:18,109
An informant would have
sold his pals out to us

591
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:20,044
At the first sign of a sniffle.

592
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:22,780
This guy...Is a cop.

593
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:28,680
<i>I don't see how this is relevant.</i>

594
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:29,681
In the land of no fun,

595
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:30,781

596
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:33,050
You got a really sensible piece of property.

597
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:34,251
Give him a break.

598
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:37,955
Knowing this guy's an undercover cop

599
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:39,023
Doesn't get us any closer to curing him.

600
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,825
Good point. You know what they say.

601
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:42,593
Information is not power.

602
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:43,761
Wait...

603
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:44,962
<i>You're saying we should</i>

604
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,263
Use the cop thing to force him to talk?

605
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:47,731
Force?

606
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,768
I'm talking about the
womanly art of persuasion.

607
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:52,970
I said womanly.

608
00:24:00,645 --> 00:24:02,012
<i>If you won't talk to us,</i>

609
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,347
<i>We'll find someone who will.</i>

610
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:05,015
I mean, you must have a supervisor.

611
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,717
A...Handler.

612
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:08,552
Good luck with that.

613
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,321
You don't know my real name.

614
00:24:10,388 --> 00:24:12,590
You don't know if I'm local or state,

615
00:24:12,657 --> 00:24:14,225
F.B.I., d.E.A.

616
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:15,893
But, by all means, get on the phone.

617
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:17,628
I get it. These guys are lowlifes.

618
00:24:17,696 --> 00:24:19,864
You want them off the street.

619
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:21,999
<i>They're not just lowlifes.</i>

620
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:25,102
Eddie killed a snitch three weeks ago.

621
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,506
Boss' orders.

622
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:31,809
The boss, he's one of the
biggest cocaine importers

623
00:24:31,877 --> 00:24:33,177
In the entire state.

624
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:36,347
And he wants to expand down to philly.

625
00:24:36,414 --> 00:24:38,516
Tomorrow night, he and eddie

626
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,518
Are meeting the big fish.

627
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:42,853
And the cops are gonna bust it.

628
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:45,389
But if you guys get caught
poking around there,

629
00:24:45,457 --> 00:24:47,825
The whole thing gets called off.

630
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:49,660
That's noble,

631
00:24:49,728 --> 00:24:52,062
But you can't put your life at risk.

632
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,133
I've been undercover for 16 months.

633
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:59,136
I haven't seen my wife...

634
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:01,205
My house, my dog.

635
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:03,841
<i>I have put far too much into this,</i>

636
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:06,677
And I will not let it fail.

637
00:25:09,548 --> 00:25:10,915
So just...

638
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:14,518
Just keep me alive for another 24 hours.

639
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:17,855
And I will tell you
everything you need to know.

640
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:21,392
Hey.

641
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:23,160
<i>Uh, can I come in?</i>

642
00:25:23,228 --> 00:25:26,263
<i>Nurses out here can't keep their hands off
of me.</i>

643
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:31,235
He's a casanova, huh?

644
00:25:31,303 --> 00:25:33,037
What, you bringing me my sandwich?

645
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:36,574
No, because, guess what.

646
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:37,608
I don't read minds.

647
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:42,346
You okay?

648
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:45,215
Aggh! Gah!

649
00:25:48,386 --> 00:25:50,421
He had a g.I. Infarction caused by a clot

650
00:25:50,488 --> 00:25:52,723
In his superior mesenteric artery.

651
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:54,058
<i>We had to remove a foot of bowel.</i>

652
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,159
If more clots keep forming,

653
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:56,927
He may not last 24 hours.

654
00:25:56,995 --> 00:25:58,862
And the moron still won't talk.

655
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,031
Bad guy, cool; good guy, moron?

656
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:02,066
Pretty much.

657
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:03,601
Guy's a hero.

658
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:06,003
He's risking his life to
put these dealers in jail.

659
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:07,638
I'm sure the dealers who take their places

660
00:26:07,706 --> 00:26:08,772
Will be very grateful.

661
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,107
So vertigo,

662
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:12,209
Fever, and thrombosis.

663
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:14,411
We've already ruled out
cancer and infection.

664
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,846
He got worse on steroids,

665
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:17,548
Which suggests it's not autoimmune.

666
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:19,483
<i>So we're stuck with environmental.</i>

667
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:20,651
But what kind of environmentals?

668
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,019
Toxins, parasites, allergens.

669
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:23,787
We should just pick the
top ten possibilities

670
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:25,255
And treat for all of them.

671
00:26:25,323 --> 00:26:26,724
<i>Except that treating for everything</i>

672
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:28,258
Could kill him faster than
whatever's killing him.

673
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:30,094
Got a better idea?

674
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:31,829
Sort of. Chase is right.

675
00:26:31,896 --> 00:26:33,497
Our patient is holding
out for noble reasons:

676
00:26:33,565 --> 00:26:34,732
<i>Protecting his bust.</i>

677
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,400
<i>Anybody else on that crew got sick,</i>

678
00:26:36,468 --> 00:26:38,602
I'm guessing they'd be a
little more self-serving.

679
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:44,608
Thanks.

680
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:48,879
Surgery went well.

681
00:26:48,947 --> 00:26:49,847
You'll be able to see him soon.

682
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:56,654
Yeah, used to be all about
ferberizing your kid.

683
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:58,722
Now they're saying it could mess them up.

684
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,824
Heh.

685
00:27:00,892 --> 00:27:03,327
My--mine's 6 1/2.

686
00:27:04,562 --> 00:27:07,197
Mickey's getting worse.

687
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:08,932
The clot is a very bad sign.

688
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,201
We really need you to
tell us where he's been.

689
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:12,403
Heh.

690
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,371
I do that...

691
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:15,973
There's a very good chance

692
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:18,242
That I could end up john
doe at the county m.E.

693
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:21,078
Look, mickey got sick because
he had the most exposure.

694
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:22,680
Other guys are at risk too.

695
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:24,515
You don't want to...

696
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:25,549
You okay?

697
00:27:25,617 --> 00:27:28,719
I--I feel dizzy.

698
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:30,721
Are you diabetic?

699
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,322
No.

700
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,224
When was the last time
you were at your office?

701
00:27:34,292 --> 00:27:37,061
Whoa...Did you drug me? What?

702
00:27:37,128 --> 00:27:39,196
You're trying to make me think that I'm sick

703
00:27:39,264 --> 00:27:41,699
So I'll take you to the stash.

704
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:43,333
Of course not, but if you are sick--

705
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:46,503
No, I don't feel sick. I feel drugged!

706
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:48,338
Trust me, I know the difference.

707
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:53,343
You didn't even drink half of it.

708
00:27:53,411 --> 00:27:54,845
You'll be fine in an hour.

709
00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:56,547
You think mickey could die?

710
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,956
Ah, it's just a deal.

711
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:07,524
I'll take you.

712
00:28:13,298 --> 00:28:14,631
Couldn't have given us a heads up

713
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:16,200
That he was living in a drycleaner?

714
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:18,168
It's like living in a vat of poison.

715
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:20,003
Is that it? Can we get out of here?

716
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:21,638
I gotta cover all our bases.

717
00:28:21,706 --> 00:28:23,874
Okay, fine. Look...Back there.

718
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:25,142
Hurry up.

719
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:41,525
What are these, more chemicals?

720
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:43,360
<i>Oh, not exactly.</i>

721
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:46,263
Uh...If this stuff was the problem,

722
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:47,865
There'd be a lot more sick people.

723
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,736
Did you call the cops?

724
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:53,737
No.

725
00:28:55,206 --> 00:28:56,373
No one's supposed to be here.

726
00:28:58,376 --> 00:28:59,643
come here.

727
00:28:59,711 --> 00:29:01,545
I said no kissing!

728
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:02,846
<i>Eddie.</i>

729
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:04,181
I didn't know you'd be here.

730
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:05,415
Um...Uh...

731
00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:07,251
Look, the deal was just for you.

732
00:29:07,318 --> 00:29:09,953
This guy wants to watch, it's an extra 50.

733
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:11,822
Yeah, private party, man.

734
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,091
Uh...I got it covered tonight.

735
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:28,472
Nice.

736
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:34,812
The jealousy is... Killing me.

737
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:37,748
Well...He clearly cares about you.

738
00:29:37,816 --> 00:29:39,049
Very much.

739
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:43,086
Why can't he show it in a-- in a normal way?

740
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:45,322
I'm so tired of...

741
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,691
The whole silence and the resentment.

742
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,828
I don't know if I can go back there tonight.

743
00:29:53,464 --> 00:29:55,165
I need some time.

744
00:29:57,302 --> 00:29:58,569
Come stay at my place.

745
00:30:00,705 --> 00:30:01,672
Really?

746
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:03,574
Mm-hmm.

747
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:05,542
It'll be fun.

748
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,710
You know, like a-- like a sleepover.

749
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,849
That would-- that would be...

750
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:13,016
It would be such a help.

751
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:15,085
Thank you.

752
00:30:15,153 --> 00:30:16,753
<i>House.</i>

753
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,624
What are you doing here?

754
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:23,060
I'm here because...

755
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:26,964
Nothing you can say is
going to change anything.

756
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:37,207
I love this man.

757
00:30:39,077 --> 00:30:41,311
And I am not wasting another moment

758
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:42,746
Of my life

759
00:30:42,814 --> 00:30:43,780
Denying that.

760
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:50,420
Gregory house...

761
00:30:51,689 --> 00:30:52,890
Will you marry me?

762
00:30:52,957 --> 00:30:55,859
Wow.

763
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:57,194
This is unexpected.

764
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:03,166
Say yes!

765
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:09,473
I'm gonna go.

766
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,507
No--no, no, no.

767
00:31:10,575 --> 00:31:11,808
You two obviously

768
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:14,278
Have some talking to do.

769
00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:15,879
excuse me.

770
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,228
How's it coming?

771
00:31:31,296 --> 00:31:32,562
So far, nothing.

772
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,731
Carpet, paint, insulation.

773
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,600
Even the gross food in the fridge.

774
00:31:36,668 --> 00:31:37,801
Everything's coming up clean.

775
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:39,403
Which leaves the dry-cleaning chemicals.

776
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,837
Should have the results in a few minutes.

777
00:31:40,905 --> 00:31:41,838
Foreman's already started him

778
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:44,341
On inhaled albuterol.

779
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:45,943
Chances are, this case is over.

780
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,444
We have to tell him.

781
00:31:47,512 --> 00:31:48,845
We can't tell him.

782
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:50,247
Won't change the fact
that cuddy let him walk.

783
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:51,448
It'll just let him know

784
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:52,749
It was all because of a stupid prank.

785
00:31:54,118 --> 00:31:55,485
We have to tell cuddy.

786
00:31:55,553 --> 00:31:58,121
<i>We confess and beg her
to take him back.</i>

787
00:31:58,189 --> 00:31:59,890
If begging worked, he would have a raise,

788
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:00,958
And we wouldn't be screwed.

789
00:32:01,025 --> 00:32:03,393
Albuterol is not helping.

790
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:04,594
Patient started coughing blood.

791
00:32:04,662 --> 00:32:06,330
What about adding ipratropium?

792
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:08,332
That might-- don't bother.

793
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,234
We assumed this place was
using perchloroethylene.

794
00:32:11,302 --> 00:32:14,104
Turns out... Petroleum solvents.

795
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:16,773
The drug dealers are
running a green drycleaner?

796
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:19,142
<i>I hate to push past the irony,</i>

797
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,178
But our patient's bleeding into his lungs,

798
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:24,626
And we've got nothing.

799
00:32:25,098 --> 00:32:26,065
The v/q scan last night

800
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:27,967
Showed a pulmonary aneurysm.

801
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:29,302
Explains the coughing blood.

802
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:31,337
I did an embolization to stop the bleeding,

803
00:32:31,405 --> 00:32:33,439
<i>He then started up again
this morning.</i>

804
00:32:33,507 --> 00:32:35,107
Three more aneurysms.

805
00:32:35,175 --> 00:32:37,109
Those look like mycotic aneurysms.

806
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:38,477
Indicates a fungal infection.

807
00:32:38,545 --> 00:32:40,379
That'd be consistent
with his other symptoms:

808
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:42,281
The vertigo, the fever.

809
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:43,215
I didn't see any fungus at the location,

810
00:32:43,283 --> 00:32:44,317
And none of the samples--

811
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:46,152
Looks like somebody missed something.

812
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,287
Which is embarrassing for somebody.

813
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:50,356
And...The steroids we gave him

814
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:52,658
<i>Would have suppressed his
immune system.</i>

815
00:32:52,726 --> 00:32:55,428
If that was a fungus,
he'd have 30 aneurysms.

816
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,229
Somebody's got a good point.

817
00:32:57,297 --> 00:33:00,099
One bleed to four in less than 12 hours?

818
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:01,567
That seems like an uptick to me.

819
00:33:01,635 --> 00:33:03,869
We need to start him on antifungal meds

820
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:05,871
Before he drowns in his own blood.

821
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:09,475
Do it.

822
00:33:11,612 --> 00:33:13,412
How long till it starts working?

823
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,181
Give it a few hours.

824
00:33:15,248 --> 00:33:16,515
We'll be back to check on you.

825
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:37,103
There you go.

826
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,337
Take it easy.

827
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:46,612
You shouldn't have taken her there,

828
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,780
You imbecile.

829
00:33:47,848 --> 00:33:51,317
They found nothing.

830
00:33:51,385 --> 00:33:53,986
You could have got your brains blown out.

831
00:33:54,054 --> 00:33:55,955
I had to do something.

832
00:33:56,023 --> 00:33:57,857
I couldn't just sit and watch and...

833
00:34:04,998 --> 00:34:06,966
You're my friend.

834
00:34:09,236 --> 00:34:11,237
Thanks.

835
00:34:13,173 --> 00:34:15,341
You'd do it for me.

836
00:34:17,778 --> 00:34:19,378
Ah.

837
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:21,113
I-I should get going.

838
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:23,683
Got the big man from
philly coming in tonight.

839
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,625
You want me to stay, I'll stay.

840
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:37,163
Jimmy knows everything that we know.

841
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,264
No.

842
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:40,566
<i>The six months</i>

843
00:34:40,634 --> 00:34:44,537
We put in on this...

844
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:47,440
You gotta be there.

845
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:54,680
I'll swing by tomorrow.

846
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:57,016
Hey, eddie.

847
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:59,351
Yeah?

848
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:02,822
I'm sorry.

849
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:08,394
You know that... I can't go with you.

850
00:35:21,408 --> 00:35:23,209
It was all our fault.

851
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:24,777
We were screwing with foreman,

852
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:28,180
Trying to make him think
he made less than we did.

853
00:35:28,248 --> 00:35:30,316
Obviously, things got out of control.

854
00:35:30,383 --> 00:35:32,384
Well, someone does something

855
00:35:32,452 --> 00:35:33,953
Stupid and insensitive,

856
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,989
I always figure it was house.

857
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:38,457
Good to know it's catching.

858
00:35:38,525 --> 00:35:40,192
Look, there is no other job.

859
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,427
He was just trying to get a raise.

860
00:35:41,495 --> 00:35:43,095
Even if you gave him a little more money,

861
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:44,330
I know he'd stay.

862
00:35:44,397 --> 00:35:46,132
<i>I'm not giving foreman a raise</i>

863
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,634
Because the three of you
decided to amuse yourselves.

864
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:50,369
We know, and that's why

865
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:52,204
We want you to take it out of our paychecks.

866
00:35:52,272 --> 00:35:54,974
You two okay with this?

867
00:35:57,644 --> 00:35:58,711
Is there any other option?

868
00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:00,446
We're okay with it.

869
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:03,082
Foreman is a good team leader.

870
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,116
He deserves it.

871
00:36:05,552 --> 00:36:07,319
Okay, then.

872
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:08,287
That is what I will do.

873
00:36:10,657 --> 00:36:12,892
<i>And just so you know...</i>

874
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:14,960
I have no idea what you're talking about.

875
00:36:15,028 --> 00:36:16,495
I haven't seen foreman in three days.

876
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:33,746
The phrase "who's your daddy?
" comes to mind.

877
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:47,159
Want to grab some coffee?

878
00:36:47,227 --> 00:36:49,161
Kind of a bad time.

879
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:50,930
Sorry.

880
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:52,865
Uh, you told me to drop by, so...

881
00:36:52,933 --> 00:36:54,066
<i>This is when I could make it.</i>

882
00:36:54,134 --> 00:36:55,301
Right.

883
00:36:55,368 --> 00:36:56,502
Come in, yeah.

884
00:37:03,176 --> 00:37:05,544
This whole thing with wilson...

885
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:07,780
It's all my fault.

886
00:37:07,848 --> 00:37:10,716
We're not closeted, because we're not gay.

887
00:37:12,052 --> 00:37:13,219
For real.

888
00:37:13,286 --> 00:37:14,987
Wilson thought you were cute,

889
00:37:15,055 --> 00:37:19,225
And I was just yanking his chain.

890
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:20,693
Maybe that's not the best phrasing.

891
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,462
So you were only spending time with me

892
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,164
To screw with him?

893
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:26,265
God, no.

894
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,433
I was spending time with you

895
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,667
Because I want to touch your boobs.

896
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:30,369
<i>Enough to listen to evita, twice.</i>

897
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:31,737
<i>And I really hate evita.</i>

898
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:33,138
That's how much I like your boobs.

899
00:37:38,378 --> 00:37:39,445
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

900
00:37:39,512 --> 00:37:41,146
Wait, wait.

901
00:37:43,283 --> 00:37:46,051
<i>Wilson... He's a really good guy.</i>

902
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:48,187
And he really likes you.

903
00:37:51,491 --> 00:37:53,459
Well, it's really...

904
00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:55,327
It's sweet of you to stick
up for your friend like that.

905
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:01,400
And you're still trying to sleep with me.

906
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:04,637
You know, maybe I will call him.

907
00:38:04,704 --> 00:38:05,771
It would serve you right.

908
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,373
Wilson's a jerk too.

909
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,642
Well, at least he tried
to do the right thing.

910
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:12,044
He's been divorced three times.

911
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:14,013
He slept with a dying patient.

912
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,414
Sure, he looks like a boy scout,

913
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:16,815
But then...

914
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:37,736
<i>the aneurysms</i>

915
00:38:37,804 --> 00:38:39,371
Look mycotic, but they're not.

916
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:41,006
<i>They're inflammatory.</i>

917
00:38:41,074 --> 00:38:43,475
Because this is not a fungal infection.

918
00:38:43,543 --> 00:38:46,245
<i>The hypertension was a real symptom.</i>

919
00:38:46,313 --> 00:38:47,713
<i>You've been unwittingly</i>

920
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:49,181
<i>Treating it with beta blockers.</i>

921
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:53,118
You stopped taking them,
and your blood pressure went up.

922
00:38:53,186 --> 00:38:54,954
It's hughes-stovin.

923
00:38:57,457 --> 00:38:59,425
Okay, so how-- how do we treat this?

924
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:07,199
We don't.

925
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:09,969
<i>Hughes-stovin is an
autoimmune disease.</i>

926
00:39:10,036 --> 00:39:11,303
Once it's this advanced,

927
00:39:11,371 --> 00:39:13,005
There's not much we can do.

928
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:16,075
<i>The aneurysms keep multiplying.</i>

929
00:39:16,142 --> 00:39:19,144
Eventually...One of them will rupture.

930
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:23,315
Are you sure?

931
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:26,785
If you die in the next day or so, I will be.

932
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:32,358
Even if you had told us
everything we wanted to know,

933
00:39:32,425 --> 00:39:33,659
It wouldn't have made a difference.

934
00:39:36,496 --> 00:39:38,030
You did the right thing.

935
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:47,006
I think I should call my wife now.

936
00:39:52,345 --> 00:40:00,119
* *

937
00:41:42,555 --> 00:41:43,989
I'm sorry about your patient.

938
00:41:46,426 --> 00:41:48,927
He died a hero in his own mind.

939
00:41:48,995 --> 00:41:51,130
Guess it's better than nothing.

940
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:53,298
Ran into Nora in the elevator.

941
00:41:53,366 --> 00:41:55,534
She no longer thinks we're gay.

942
00:41:55,602 --> 00:41:57,736
Now she thinks we're mendacious dirt bags.

943
00:41:57,804 --> 00:42:02,908
Mendacious dirt bag comes
much more naturally to me.

944
00:42:02,976 --> 00:42:05,043
Least we can get rid of that.

945
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:06,712
I kind of like it.

946
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:08,981
Unlike this sofa.

947
00:42:09,048 --> 00:42:10,549
It's 500 bucks.

948
00:42:11,684 --> 00:42:14,686
And... It reclines.

949
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,824
* one *

950
00:42:18,892 --> 00:42:21,059
* singular sensation *

951
00:42:21,127 --> 00:42:23,762
* every little step she takes *

952
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,497
I will punch you in the face.

953
00:42:25,565 --> 00:42:27,099
I'll stop, if you get rid of the sofa.

954
00:42:28,535 --> 00:42:29,735
No chance.

955
00:42:29,802 --> 00:42:31,036
* buh duh duh duh duh duh *

956
00:42:31,104 --> 00:42:32,271
<i>* one *</i>

957
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:33,605
* thrilling combination *

958
00:42:33,673 --> 00:42:36,275
* every move that she makes *

959
00:42:36,342 --> 00:42:37,776
* buh buh, buh buh, buh buh *

960
00:42:37,844 --> 00:42:39,745
<i>* one smile, and suddenly *</i>

961
00:42:39,812 --> 00:42:41,713
* nobody else, boom *

962
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:42,948
* will, boom *

963
00:42:43,016 --> 00:42:53,918
