00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:09,549
Hey.

00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:10,617
<i>Hey, I'll be
right there.</i>

3
00:00:10,884 --> 00:00:12,318
Take your time.

4
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:15,321
<i>You mind if I get
a drink of water?</i>

5
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,824
<i>No, not at all.
Help yourself.</i>

6
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:32,872
Not exactly
beach reading, huh?

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,275
Do you understand
any of that stuff?

8
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:37,176
Well, most of these
i can get through,

9
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:38,478
But, uh, that one?

10
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:40,079
<i>Can't get past
the dust jacket.</i>

11
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:41,481
<i>Where's Ted?
Laid off.</i>

12
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:43,783
Company's going with per diem
workers, you know.

13
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:45,985
You don't have to pay overtime,
health insurance.

14
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,187
Wow. That sucks.

15
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:51,824
I don't mind. Really, I'm not
a 40-hour-a-week kind of guy.

16
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:54,193
Uh...

17
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:55,728
<i>If I could just
get you to sign.</i>

18
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:58,665
Right. Um...

19
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:01,701
Hang on one second.
I want to show you something.

20
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:06,706
You're gonna laugh,
but, uh,

21
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:12,445
<i>I swear, this guy James Sidas
looks exactly like you.</i>

22
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:14,113
Wait, hang on a second.

23
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:17,216
This guy is you.

24
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:18,818
<i>I saw a profile
Nova did on you.</i>

25
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:21,621
<i>You're, like, the youngest guy

26
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,255
Standards were lower

27
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:24,724

30
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:32,265
Yeah, uh, sorry,
I really need to get going.

31
00:01:32,332 --> 00:01:33,900
So if I could just
get you to sign off.

32
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:37,769
All right. I'll trade you.
I'll sign if you'll sign.

33
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:39,839
<i>I'm not that guy anymore.
Come on, man.</i>

34
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:41,140
this is the most
exciting thing

35
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:45,912
That's happened
in this place in years.

36
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:53,086
<i>Come on.</i>

37
00:01:53,153 --> 00:01:56,055
<i>Don't be like that.
I'm paying you a compliment.</i>

38
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:57,724
It's...

39
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,560
It's not that, um...

40
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:02,528
My hand's not working.

41
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:03,996
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.

42
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:07,600
You okay?

43
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:09,502
No.

I don't know who Dr. Wilson is,
and we don't have tabs.

47
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:55,581

00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:57,483
No.
Good.

49
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:59,285
But, sir--

50
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:01,787
I got it. It's all right.

51
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:04,123
Thanks.

52
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:05,324
Although I should
make it clear

53
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:09,628
that for two bucks all you get
is top half, over the clothes.

54
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,430
Any plans for turkey day?

55
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:14,667
Going to my sister's
for dinner. Why?

56
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:16,569
Just making pleasant
conversation.

57
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:18,471
I've heard tell
of folks doing such.

Great.

62
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:25,811
Really?
Sure.

63
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,980
There's no point
in putting a band together

64
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:28,647
if we're not gonna
play any gigs.

65
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:31,283
Hold on.
Take this instead.

66
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:33,018
I was expecting
more resistance.

67
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:33,920
That was the "old" me.

68
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:36,188
"New" me is static-guarded
and friction-free.

69
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:38,924
Enjoy your drumstick.

70
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:46,198

<i>Probably not

80
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:03,750
but you get the idea.

81
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:06,486
Ataxia and anemia
could be viral. Maybe West Nile?

82
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:09,421
No fever,
lymph glands were normal.

83
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:10,389
Anybody seen Wilson?

84
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:11,757

Yeah, like that's

00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:14,827
Meningitis.

87
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:16,262
Anemia's a stretch.

Come on. We get the tennis elbow

Let them have
sickle cell.

94
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:30,709
TTP's a better fit.
He's right.

95
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:35,215
What, you thought I wouldn't
agree with him? Ever?

96
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:37,684
You didn't agree with him.
That's why he dumped you.

97
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:39,452
Oh, sorry. It was mutual.

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,587
We're cool, okay?
Nobody's angry, nobody's hurt.

99
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:43,288
<i>Sounds passionate.</i>

100
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:44,590
TTP makes sense to me.

101
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:45,558
Not to me.

102

One big, happy family.

TTP it is.

105
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,263
Confirm with
a blood smear

106
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:53,632

<i>Dr. James Wilson,
please dial 558.</i>

108
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,937
Can you cure it?

109
00:04:58,004 --> 00:04:59,838
TTP isn't
completely curable,

110
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:02,207
but the symptoms are manageable
with the proper treatment.

111
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:03,342
Is this the treatment?

112
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,544
No, first we need to do a blood
test to confirm the diagnosis.

113
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:06,812
But he's gonna
get better.

114
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,580
<i>Honey, that's what

115
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:09,549
I'm gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

116
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:11,750
How can't I worry?
You're in the hospital.

117
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:13,386
I'm gonna be fine.

118
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:15,555
<i>You're sure everything
was fine before?</i>

119
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:17,056
Given your
educational background,

120
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:19,558
you'd think you could at least
find a job with a medical plan.

121
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:21,693
<i>We have money.
Don't worry.</i>

122
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:23,262
<i>It's not that,
It's just--</i>

123
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:25,530
I want to make sure we have
all the information we should.

124
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:26,732
My husband wouldn't lie.

125
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,302
It's okay, baby.
He's just doing his job.

126
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:31,137
He just wants
to make sure I'm not

127
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,573
a secret drug addict
or an alcoholic.

128
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,476
Or hiding a history
of mental illness?

129
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:40,779
I work as a courier
because I want to.

130
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:42,448
<i>It's easy.
I don't have to think.</i>

131
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:43,382
It's too hard to think.

132
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,118
No, just unpleasant.

133
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:48,720
<i>No matter what I did,
it really wasn't good enough.</i>

134
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:50,456
<i>then I met Dara.</i>

135
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:51,791
She didn't care
how smart I was

136
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:54,126
or what I might accomplish
in the future.

137
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:55,428
<i>It was the first time
in my life</i>

138
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:58,063
<i>that I was really happy.</i>

139
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:01,934
So I decided I would
rather be happy than smart.

140
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:15,414
You all right?

141
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:18,717
Sorry. I know you're not okay.
I mean...

142
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:20,786
She left.

143
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:24,623
<i>Went back to Chicago.</i>

144
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:26,125
Any chance
of reconciliation?

145
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:28,160
Nope.

146
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:30,429
Sure you don't want
to grab a drink after work?

147
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:32,764
Figured we could talk about
the perils of dating doctors.

148
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:33,799
I wasn't dating Cameron.

149
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,133
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to--

150
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:38,304
I know what you're doing
and I appreciate it,

151
00:06:38,371 --> 00:06:40,439
but I've got it
under control.

152
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:42,608
<i>That's what you said
about the Dibala incident.</i>

153
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:44,476
And obviously you didn't.

154
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:48,146
And talking about it obviously
made things so much better.

155
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:56,488
Didn't you think there was
something weird about that guy?

156
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:59,291
Not really. In fact,
he seemed pretty normal.

157
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,026
That's my point.

158
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:04,363
Guys with IQs off the chart
are usually completely...

159
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,964
<i>Abnormal.</i>

160
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:06,999
Speaking of House,

161
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:08,700
<i>Why'd you come back?</i>

162
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:10,335
I mean, you must've
taken a major pay cut.

163
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:11,770
Life's too short
to worry about money.

164
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:12,939
Your wife feel
the same way?

165
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:15,874
She's happy to cut back
on some things...

166
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:19,111
Like sex.

167
00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:20,079
Why'd you come back?

168
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:20,847
<i>Why wouldn't I?</i>

169
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:22,915
Like Foreman said,
nobody's angry.

170
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:24,449
<i>Nobody's hurt.</i>

171
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,084
Schistocytes.

172
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:28,020
That means TTP.

173
00:07:28,088 --> 00:07:29,121
<i>Which is what
we thought it'd be.</i>

174
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,622
Remember?
This is a good thing.

175
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,724
<i>This is an easy thing.</i>

176
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,426
And House doesn't take
cases that are easy,

177
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:35,494
<i>which means
It's not TTP,</i>

178
00:07:35,562 --> 00:07:38,864
and he wants to see how long
it takes us to catch up to him.

179
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:43,936
Schistocytes suggest TTP.

180
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:45,804
Good. Now what?

181
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:47,606
Normally, we'd
try plasmapheresis,

182
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:50,108
but the patient has
an albumin colloid allergy.

183
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:50,843
So?

184
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:53,112
So that means we have to
give him a splenectomy.

185
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:55,647
Yes, it does.

186
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,662
<i>Wilson?
No.</i>

187
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,265
<i>Do you know where he is?
Not in here.</i>

188
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,067
<i>You're sure you want us
to take out his spleen.</i>

189
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:16,302
<i>Is that what
a "splenectomy" is?</i>

190
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:17,803
I thought it was
an ice cream treat.

191
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,571
Yuck.

192
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:21,106
So you do really
think he has TTP?

193
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:22,207
<i>You're not
just testing us.</i>

194
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:24,743
Yeah, like I have
time for games.

195
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:27,779
So why did you really
take this case?

196
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:29,081
Isn't it obvious?

197
00:08:29,148 --> 00:08:32,317
I'm fishing
for a dinner invite.

198
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,595
Missed you at
breakfast this morning.

199
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:45,430
And lunch.

200
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:46,798
I had a dentist
appointment.

201
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:48,300
<i>You know where
Cuddy's sister lives?</i>

202
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:52,938
You see, this is why I don't
answer your urgent pages.

203
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:54,873
Because they're
not urgent pages.

204
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:57,743
I've decided what I'm gonna do
about Cuddy and Lucas.

205
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,579
I'm going to
break them up.
Of course.

206
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:04,349
<i>It's given me a purpose in life,
a goal, a raison d'etre.</i>

207
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:08,420
<i>Albeit a selfish,
mean-spirited, childish raison.</i>

208
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:11,189
I think of it more
as benevolent.

209
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:13,659
There's only two possible
outcomes for their relationship.

210
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:15,527
They split, or they stay
together forever.

211
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:16,962
If It's split,

212
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,630
Then the sooner it happens
the better for everyone.

213
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:20,766
If It's stay,
then my meddling won't matter.

214
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,935
In fact,
if they survive it,

215
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:26,271
It might even make
their bond stronger.

216
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,874
How you manage
to elevate your narcissism

217
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:33,278
To beneficence
is masterful.

218
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:35,614
Indinner.

219
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:37,516
Just 'cause
I'm sentimental.

220
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,785
Dinner is at Cuddy's sister's,
which brings us back--

221
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:41,553
House, don't.

222
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:43,588
I fished for an invite.
Cuddy wasn't biting,

223
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:44,923
So I'll have to crash.

224
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:47,826
I have no idea where
Cuddy's sister lives.

225
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:49,728
Ask and thou
shalt receive.

226
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:53,165
You can't honestly think
i would help you with this.

227
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:56,001
Not help me, help Cuddy.
Remember?

228
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:57,235
If you don't get it,

229
00:09:57,303 --> 00:09:59,538
I'll be forced to use
more nefarious methods.

230
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:02,474
Happy holidays.

231
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:07,679
Huh. Looks great.

232
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:10,282
So he's all better?

233
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,050
Probably be on
some long-term meds,

234
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:13,952
And he's about
ten ounces lighter.

235
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,856
Other than that,
won't even know It's gone.

236
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:22,127
Did you hear that, honey?
You're gonna be just fine.

237
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:23,729
When can I get
out of here?

238
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:25,330
Everything checks out,
less than a week.

239
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:27,065
<i>Good, 'cause those boxes</i>

240
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:30,469
Aren't gonna
deliver colors.

241
00:10:30,536 --> 00:10:31,503
Colors?

242
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:32,504
<i>Green...</i>

243
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:35,107
And orange...

244
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,374
And ceiling.

245
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,443
Mr. Sidas, do you know
where you are?

246
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:40,212
Chewing.

247
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,546
Jimmy?

248
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:42,814
Shirt...

249
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:45,350
He's stroking.
Call the cath lab now.

250
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:47,419
Oh, my god.

251
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:50,171
Blood flow's restored.

252
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:51,672
<i>There appears to be
no permanent damage.</i>

253
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,974
Good news is it turns out
to be an exciting, action-packed

254
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:55,242
Thrill ride
of a case after all.

255
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,546
Bad news is we took out
his spleen for nothing.

256
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,748
Thank god he's still got
his appendix and tonsils.

257
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:04,618
<i>So what looks like TTP,
acts like TTP,</i>

258
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:07,888
Tests like TTP,
but isn't TTP?

259
00:11:07,956 --> 00:11:11,192
CNS vasculitis explains ataxia,
and anemia, maybe the stroke.

260
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:13,627
CT would've
picked up something.

261
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:16,063
Hi, I'm Greg House,
a friend of your sister Lisa.

262
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:17,398
Could be DIC.

263
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:18,699
Lisa Cuddy.

264
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:19,700
<i>Sorry. Wrong number.</i>

265
00:11:19,768 --> 00:11:21,035
You gonna ask?

266
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:23,771
I'm sure he's got a perfectly
logical explanation.

267
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,272
Can't be DIC.
No hemorrhaging.

268
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,208
And I'm calling
all 12 Julia Cuddys

269
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:28,442
Within a 100-mile radius.

270
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,911
See?
Completely reasonable.

271
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:32,780
<i>Acquired
pancytopenia.
WBC's normal.</i>

272
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:34,482
Hey, Julia.

273
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:37,518
<i>You're, uh--
You're Lisa's sister, right?</i>

274
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:40,421
You sure?
'Cause you are number 12.

275
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:42,823
Maybe she got married
and changed her name.

276
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:44,992
Otis Campbell.

277
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,160
Probably kept
her first name.

278
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:47,561
<i>The mnemonic for toxins.</i>

279
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:50,331
O for organophosphates,
t for tricyclics, I for insulin.

280
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:52,199
Or as I remember it,
"Moist Place."

281
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:55,169
That's "place" spelled
with two "l"s and a silent "B."

282
00:11:55,237 --> 00:11:56,904
Except the tox screen
was negative.

283
00:11:56,972 --> 00:11:58,873
Standard tox screen--Unstandard
toxins don't show up on it.

284
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,574
You two do an
unstandard tox screen,

285
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,976
You two search his home.

286
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,979
Otis Campbell's
got to be hiding somewhere.

287
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:08,883
Smartest guy in the world,
and this is the best he can do.

288
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,150
<i>Maybe he's doing
what he loves.</i>

289
00:12:10,218 --> 00:12:12,987
Delivering boxes
was a childhood dream.

290
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:15,256
Soda, processed cheese,

291
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:16,657
Marshmallow spread.

292
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:18,325
Nothing in here
is capable of going bad.

293
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:22,830
Ibuprofen, eye drops,
cough syrup.

294
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:27,301
You want to come over
for Thanksgiving dinner?

295
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:29,637
You never asked me
over before. Why now?

296
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:31,539
I just never
thought of it.

297
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:33,407
But now that we're
both on the team...

298
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:36,243
And my wife left me?

299
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:38,312
Is that a bad reason?

300
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:44,418
No. But, uh, I'm okay.
On both the food and friends.

301
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:46,020
<i>Mice.</i>

302
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:50,624
Leptospirosis could explain
the ataxia and the anemia.

303
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:52,059
But not without a fever.

304
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:54,161
You have someone
to talk to?

305
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:57,164
Yeah.
Who?

306
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:58,499
What, you want names?

307
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:01,535
<i>Look, you lost a friend.
I get it.</i>

308
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:03,537
But I'm not Kutner.

309
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:06,674
Good, 'cause Kutner never
used to come over for dinner.

310
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:09,043
I'm gonna pretend there's
something interesting over here

311
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,546
So you'll shut up.

312
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,991
Actually, there is.

313
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,962
He's got sketches
of atomic structure,

314
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:30,898
<i>This one's full
of math proofs.</i>

315
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:34,134
They're all old.
Nothing since '96.

316
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:35,669
<i>This isn't some
homework assignment</i>

317
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:36,670
<i>His parents
forced on him.</i>

318
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:40,174
This is passion.

319
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:41,942
<i>Why would he want
to stop doing this?</i>

320
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,678
Marriage destroyed
his soul.

321
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:58,325
Ooh.

322
00:13:58,393 --> 00:14:02,129
Or maybe it was
just the booze.

323
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,267
Thank you, doctor,
you've been wonderful.

324
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:08,736
As have you, Diana.

325
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:11,305
<i>Be well.
Thank you.</i>

326
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:12,306
You're helping.

327
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:13,841
Voluntarily.

328
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:15,709
He's done six already.

329
00:14:15,777 --> 00:14:17,778
<i>Figured you might
be getting backed up.</i>

330
00:14:17,846 --> 00:14:19,680
The holiday season
and all.

331
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:21,482
So which one of us slipped
through the wormhole

332
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:22,783
into an alternate
dimension?

333
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:25,486
I have always loved to travel.
And paint.

334
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:27,121
Lucky number seven.

335
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:28,589
House...

336
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:30,057
I know you're
trying to be nice,

337
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,292
But I also know you're doing it
because you have an agenda.

338
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,698
Wow. Sexy and smart.
Lucas is a lucky guy.

339
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:42,703
The question is, is this
a bad agenda or a good one?

340
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:44,938
<i>Either you're trying
to screw with me,</i>

341
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:49,743
Or you're trying to show me
that you've really changed.

342
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:54,114
So which is it?
I'm dying to know.

343
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,223
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving dinner?

344
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,161
Peace in our time.

345
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:12,833
It cost me 45 minutes
of clinic duty.

346
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:14,802
This is
a three-Hour drive.

347
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:16,470
<i>Have you considered
the possibility</i>

348
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:18,172
that this is
a fake address?

349
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,540
You think she'd send me
to a vacant lot

350
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:20,507
for Thanksgiving dinner?

351
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,608
If she's smart.

352
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:22,843
She is.

353
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,712
That's why I ran it
through motor vehicles.

354
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,847
Good as gold.

355
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:28,248
This cannot end well.

356
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:29,616
I don't want it
to end well.

357
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:31,819
<i>You should
come as my date.</i>

358
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:35,255
You're not gonna
want to miss this.

359
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:39,932
The unstandard tox screen was
as clean as the standard one.

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,335
But we found Vodka
stashed away in his place.

361
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:45,838
What's with the ties?

362
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:48,207
Makes me look adorably
non-threatening.

363
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:51,276
Party or party hearty?

364
00:15:51,344 --> 00:15:55,414
Liver failure would
explain all the symptoms.

365
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:59,518
Party.

366
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:03,422
So guy's a brainiac, and his
secret drug of choice is booze?

367
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,891
That's kind of pedestrian,
don't you think?

368
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,693
Talk to him.
He's a pedestrian guy.

369
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:09,795
<i>With pedestrian
alcoholism.</i>

370
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,530
Liver biopsy can wait
until after Thanksgiving.

371
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:13,065
Yes, assuming
the biopsy's gonna tell us

372
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:14,500
Exactly what we
expect it to tell us,

373
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,535
It can wait till
after new year's.

374
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:18,871
<i>On the other hand,
Taub and Thirteen</i>

375
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:20,005
<i>Can do the liver
biopsy today.</i>

376
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:21,040
Why us?

377
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:22,441
Juniority.

378
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:24,076
<i>Welcome back.</i>

379
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:25,644
What do you
want us to do?

380
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:28,380
Same as me.
Have a happy Thanksgiving.

381
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,652
I'm not an alcoholic.

382
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,220
Yes, you just hide Vodka
around the house for fun.

383
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:38,223
I drink, just not a lot.

384
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,993
Since when do you
drink at all?

385
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:43,429
I have one shot when I get home
from work, baby, that's it.

386
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:45,330
So why lie
to your wife about it?

387
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:47,032
<i>Because It's
not important.</i>

388
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,967
What difference
does it make?

389
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:51,503
That you drink every day
by yourself?

390
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:53,072
I have one
lousy drink, okay?

391
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:55,507
Have you ever
seen me drunk? Ever?

392
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:56,608
No, but you've
obviously been

393
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,010
Drinking enough
to hurt your liver.

394
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,581
<i>My liver is fine.
Hold still.</i>

395
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:05,117
There we go.

396
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:08,721
This test is
a waste of time.

397
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:23,302
Hey.
Want some wine?

398
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:35,414
All right. Very good.
Here, we got this.

399
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:37,082
<i>String beans?</i>

400
00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:59,471
Julia?

401
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:01,607
<i>No, I'm
the house sitter.</i>

402
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:03,876
They're in hawaii
for the week.

403
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:12,684
Happy Thanksgiving.

404
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:16,321
Happy Thanksgiving,
you guys.

405
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:18,991
You must be Dr. House.

406
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:22,861
I was told I should offer you
a turkey sandwich.

407
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:38,710
Tuna salad. Closest thing
they had to turkey.

408
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:40,012
Thanks.

409
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,513
But I'm hoping I can
still get out of here

410
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:42,648
to catch the tail end
of dinner with my wife.

411
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:43,916
<i>Anything?</i>

412
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:46,652
No cirrhosis, no scarring,
no infection.

413
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:47,686
Blood panel?

414
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:49,588
Elevated albumen: 7.2.

415
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:50,622
That's it?

416
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,257
Everything else is fine.

417
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:56,528
So it was
a waste of time.

418
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:59,464
<i>Unless It's not his liver
that's elevating his albumen.</i>

419
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:01,900
<i>It's his kidneys.</i>

420
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:03,869
<i>Renal failure.
Explains the anemia.</i>

421
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:06,638
If he developed hyperkalemia,
that would explain the ataxia.

422
00:19:06,706 --> 00:19:07,739
<i>But the stroke...</i>

423
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:08,974
Ischemic encephalopathy.

424
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:11,643
Nice.

425
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:14,179
Except now we have to stay
and test his kidneys.

426
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:30,229
Key under the mat.

427
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:31,196
There's no key
under the mat.

428
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:32,598
<i>Oh, right.</i>

429
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:35,667
You need to replace
one of your kitchen windows.

430
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:39,271
<i>I helped myself
to your wine cellar.</i>

431
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:41,273
I'll leave a buck
on the way out.

432
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:43,709
<i>You're not
right for her.</i>

433
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:44,676
And you are?

434
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:46,378
Less wrong.

435
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:49,248
Ah.

436
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:52,384
Then I started
thinking...

437
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:57,589
What was I saying?

438
00:19:57,657 --> 00:20:00,659
You were saying
It's late, and...

439
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:02,361
She invited me.

440
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:05,664
<i>She didn't know
if she should.</i>

441
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:09,468
She was trying to figure out
if I really have changed or...

442
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:13,939
If I'm just the same old S.O.B.
I've always been.

443
00:20:17,243 --> 00:20:21,346
But she always
gave me a chance.

444
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:24,883
832 chances.

445
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:27,085
<i>And I used up
every one of them.</i>

446
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:28,287
<i>832's her limit.</i>

447
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:34,126
Make a note.

448
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,628
How 'bout
a cup of coffee?

449
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:37,796
It's just instant, but...

450
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:48,540
I'm pathetic.

451
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:51,043
I don't deserve her.

452
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,479
Okay, okay, all right.

453
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:57,649
Uh, here.

454
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,488
Maybe you should
crash here.

455
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:07,025
It's a sofa bed.

456
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:09,594
I love her.

457
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:21,344
Rhabdomyolysis.

458
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:22,946
No edema.

459
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:25,014
I trust you had
a wonderful Thanksgiving?

460
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:26,883
I don't remember.

461
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,618
So I guess I did.

462
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:29,719
Multiple myeloma.

463
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:30,687
No bone pain.

464
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:31,721
You got drunk alone?

465
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:33,223
No.

466
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,859
That would be a sign that I need
to talk to you about this.

467
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,394
Polycystic
kidney disease?

468
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:40,663
<i>No UTIS or flank pain.</i>

469
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:43,666
Well, what if his cough
is more than just a cold?

470
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,168
He hasn't been coughing.

471
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,503
It's in his history,
and we found

472
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,171
A new bottle of cough syrup
in his medicine cabinet.

473
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,672
Cough could mean
goodpasture syndrome.

474
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,441
Affects kidneys
and lungs.

475
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,777
Start him on immunosuppressors
and dialysis.

476
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:55,512
We'll do it after
we run it by House.

477
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:56,646
<i>He's not answering
his pager.</i>

478
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:58,481
Looks like he's
leaving it up to us.

479
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,116
Us, not you.

480
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:01,785
<i>And since we
don't disagree,</i>

481
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:05,188
you can save your fight
for another case.

482
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:12,595
How long do I have to
be hooked up for?

483
00:22:12,663 --> 00:22:15,265
Four to six hours a day
until we see an improvement.

484
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:16,633
What if you don't?

485
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,701
Then we keep doing it until
he gets a transplant.

486
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,036
<i>You were sure
it was his spleen,</i>

487
00:22:20,104 --> 00:22:22,071
And then you were sure
it was his liver,

488
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:23,440
<i>Which he told you
it wasn't,</i>

489
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:24,874
<i>And now you're sure
It's his kidneys.</i>

490
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:26,242
<i>It's definitely
his kidneys.</i>

491
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,778
We just don't know
why It's his kidneys.

492
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:35,385
Any word from Cameron?

493
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:37,954
Nope.

494
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:41,391
I started seeing a counselor
after my diagnosis.

495
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,526
She's really good.

496
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:45,562
Why does everyone assume
that everyone works

497
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:47,363
in the exact same way?

498
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:48,898
We pretty much do.

499
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:50,900
Our egos want us to think
we're all snowflakes,

500
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:54,170
no two alike, but really
we all want the same things.

501
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:56,105
Love, forgiveness...

502
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:57,507
Chocolate.

503
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:01,110
Well, what I want is for
everyone to leave me alone.

504
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:02,912
How do I get that?

505
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:16,493
What did you say
to Lucas last night?

506
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,330
I know there were
a lot of consonants.

507
00:23:20,397 --> 00:23:23,967
I don't remember how I got here,
never mind what I said.

508
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:25,835
<i>Well, I just
talked to him.</i>

509
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:27,036
And he said he thought
it'd be better

510
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:29,205
if we stopped
seeing each other.

511
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:30,673
Said he didn't realize

512
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:33,610
How much there still was
between you and me,

513
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:38,147
and he didn't want to get
caught in the middle of us.

514
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:42,418
I was drunk.

515
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:43,720
Whatever I said,
he can't really--

516
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:45,989
<i>I've had enough, House.</i>

517
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:50,827
I actually felt bad
about scamming you.

518
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:55,231
But then you lived down to
my expectations and then some.

519
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,239
There is no "us."

520
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:05,174
There never will be.

521
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,617
It worked.

522
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:17,253
Please tell me you're talking
about a medical procedure.

523
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:19,055
They split up
this morning.

524
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:20,590
You're the very first
one I've told.

525
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:23,426
And you think she'll
start dating you?

526
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:25,595
I'm sure she hates you.

527
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:27,263
But her eyes say,

528
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:29,899
"How will I ever pay you
for that tennis lesson?"

529
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,868
What a shame.

530
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:33,136
<i>They'll get over it.</i>

531
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:34,337
I meant for you.

532
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:37,874
I'll get over it
faster than they do.

533
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:40,777
Can't believe
that Lucas fell for my

534
00:24:40,844 --> 00:24:41,945
<i>"I never say this
because It's so personal</i>

535
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:44,280
Except that I'm drunk"
profession of love.

536
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:45,882
Second-oldest trick
in the book.

537
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,918
You're right. It's his fault
because he's stupid.

538
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:56,025
He certainly is.

539
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:07,070
You're stupid.

540
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:09,939
Well, I'm rubber,
and you're glue.

541
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:11,908
He's not pedestrian,
he's stupid.

542
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,644
At least stupider
than he should be.

543
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:16,512
He's a DXM junkie.

544
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,814
Dextromethorphan.

545
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,682
<i>As in cough syrup?</i>

546
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,017
He wasn't taking it
for his cough.

547
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:24,053
It's cheap, available
at your corner drug store,

548
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:28,124
And taken in high doses,
It's a dumb drug.

549
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,793
Dumb drug.
Well, he obviously hasn't--

550
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:32,428
<i>He's smart
compared to you.</i>

551
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:36,032
He's a moron
compared to what he was.

552
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,836
"Robotripping" lowers the IQ.
It also causes brain damage.

553
00:25:39,903 --> 00:25:43,072
Unless taken with the proper
amount of ethanol.

554
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,508
About one drink per day.

555
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:48,277
<i>He wasn't
abusing the booze</i>

556
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:49,846
And taking the cough remedy
medicinally.

557
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:51,614
He was abusing
the cough meds,

558
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:54,651
And taking
the booze medicinally.

559
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:56,152
Bravo.

560
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,554
Why would you do that?

561
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:00,289
If you had a--

562
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:02,091
A gift, why would you
just throw it away?

563
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,360
I didn't throw it away.

564
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:06,362
I just turned it
down a little.

565
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,831
When my brain
was on low,

566
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:10,933
Everything didn't seem
so miserable anymore.

567
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,736
Life was bearable.

568
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:15,738
I thought that
i did that.

569
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:19,676
You do.

570
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:21,978
<i>Long-term abuse of DXM
explains all your symptoms.</i>

571
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:25,481
Even--Oh, sweet irony--
Your cough.

572
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:27,650
<i>Whole bowel lavage,
activated charcoal.</i>

573
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:30,687
<i>We get all traces of it
out of your system.</i>

574
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:33,056
You'll be the unhappiest
little courier in no time.

575
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:36,526
I don't think I can
live without it.

576
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:41,764
You'd be surprised
what you can live without.

577
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:43,166
Make him a genius.

578
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:49,833
I can't believe it.
He looks so much better already.

579
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,768
<i>We were thinking
about calling GQ.</i>

580
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:57,672
Lavage has removed all traces
of DXM from his body.

581
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,007
You're drawing again.

582
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,009
<i>What is it?
Just doodles.</i>

583
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,043
<i>No, It's not.</i>

584
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:06,114
Come on, jimmy,
i want to know.

585
00:27:06,182 --> 00:27:12,120
This is a toroidal
helicon plasma device.

586
00:27:12,188 --> 00:27:16,224
It determines
the amount of energy

587
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:21,730
Expended by
the subatomic particles.

588
00:27:21,797 --> 00:27:25,033
<i>I'm thirsty. Could you
get me a juice or something?</i>

589
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,069
Yeah, of course.

590
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:30,639
I'm so happy, Jimmy.

591
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,981
I told you.

592
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,751
Do you know what the difference
between her IQ and mine is?

593
00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:45,420
91 points.

594
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:47,656
In relation, she's closer
to a gibbon than she is to me.

595
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:51,026
Having sex with her would be
an act of bestiality.

596
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:53,862
I assume you
didn't marry her

597
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,197
<i>for her skill
in applied physics.</i>

598
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,798
I just wish
she could spell it.

599
00:27:56,866 --> 00:27:59,401
You really think
you'd be happier

600
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:01,469
with someone
who could spell better?

601
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:03,738
No.

602
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:04,873
That's the problem.

603
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:07,209
<i>I'm the one
who's a jerk.</i>

604
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:11,313
But I owe her everything.

605
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,784
I want to want
to be with her.

606
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:20,589
And when I'm clear, I...

607
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:23,825
I can't.

608
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:27,295
Fainting, dizziness,
shortness of breath?

609
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:28,330
<i>Sometimes.</i>

610
00:28:28,397 --> 00:28:30,932
Is the wait
always this long?

611
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,634
Only on days
that end in "day."

612
00:28:32,702 --> 00:28:34,336
Diarrhea, weight loss?

613
00:28:34,403 --> 00:28:36,104
A bit.

614
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,473
Don't you ever shave?

615
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:40,342
Yeah. Once a week.
How 'bout you?

616
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:42,611
Stomach pain, tenderness?

617
00:28:42,678 --> 00:28:44,279
<i>Every now and then.</i>

618
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,147
Are you this rude
to all your patients?

619
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:48,083
Oh, yes. Don't think
you're special.

620
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,320
So we've got a lot of vague,
unverifiable symptoms.

621
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:54,923
Yet all the physical signs
are perfectly normal.

622
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:56,191
What do you think I have?

623
00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:59,027
I'm not sure,
but I think It's...

624
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:00,061
A lame job.

625
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,796
What?

626
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:02,931
You're a rat.

627
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,933
Insurance company
sends you out

628
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:06,668
To check on the quality
of medical care.
That's ridiculous.

629
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:08,403
Is it really?

630
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:10,005
'Cause you seem
a lot more interested

631
00:29:10,072 --> 00:29:11,539
in asking questions
than answering them.

632
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:13,575
Handwriting on your
medical records is obviously

633
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:14,943
not a doctor's 'cause
i can almost read it.

634
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:16,411
And when you went out
for a urine sample,

635
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,946
I looked in your purse.

636
00:29:18,014 --> 00:29:20,282
Found the list of questions
you were supposed to memorize

637
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:22,183
before you came
to the clinic.

638
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:23,351
I was looking for gum.

639
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:24,953
You're an ass.

640
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:26,154
Put it in your report.

641
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,822
I tell you what.

642
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,758
I'll give you 20 bucks
if you'll pretend that I'm not

643
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:32,794
when we leave this room.

644
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:36,865
Remember,
first ice, then heat.

645
00:29:36,932 --> 00:29:39,167
If you have any problems,
don't hesitate to call me.

646
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:43,505
Thank you, Dr. House.

647
00:29:43,572 --> 00:29:45,707
Wait a second.
Where's Cuddy?

648
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:49,110
Gone for the day.

649
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:50,712
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

650
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,647
Sorry.

651
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:54,049
I can't remember
if I've mocked you yet

652
00:29:54,116 --> 00:29:56,284
for being a male nurse.

653
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,219
I think this counts.

654
00:29:58,287 --> 00:29:59,821
Fair enough.

655
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:05,593
That isn't
the man I married.

656
00:30:05,661 --> 00:30:06,928
Yes, he is.

657
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:09,097
He's just smarter.

658
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:10,632
<i>Give him some time.
I'm sure--</i>

659
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,100
He hates me.

660
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:13,702
<i>His body is going
through withdrawal.</i>

661
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:15,036
He's adjusting.

662
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,971
<i>Maybe he never loved me.
Not really.</i>

663
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,842
Maybe we never really
had anything at all.

664
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,811
<i>Somebody help!</i>

665
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:31,886
I can't feel my legs.
I can't feel my legs.

666
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,757
Anywhere.

667
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:39,094
Nothing.

668
00:30:42,698 --> 00:30:45,233
We have to talk
about this.

669
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,802
It's late. I'm tired.

670
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,439
I know it's
a big pay cut,

671
00:30:51,507 --> 00:30:53,141
Bubut I'll always have
the chance to make money.

672
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:55,877
<i>I won't always have
the chance to do this job.</i>

673
00:30:55,945 --> 00:30:57,112
That's what you think?

674
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,581
<i>That It's about
the money?</i>

675
00:30:59,648 --> 00:31:01,616
So it's that
I didn't consult you

676
00:31:01,684 --> 00:31:03,017
<i>Before I took the job?</i>

677
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:05,353
That was offensive,
but It's not about that either.

678
00:31:05,421 --> 00:31:08,289
<i>So then...</i>

679
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:11,826
Can you give me
the first letter?

680
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:16,431
When we got married,

681
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,467
You were an intern working
30-hour shifts doing grunt work.

682
00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:21,136
<i>And we both
put up with it</i>

683
00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:23,037
<i>Because we knew that it was
leading to something better.</i>

684
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:25,507
<i>In your private practice,
you are the boss.</i>

685
00:31:25,574 --> 00:31:27,142
You call the shots,

686
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:30,011
But now you're 40 years old,
you're still doing grunt work.

687
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,282
That's what this is about?
You think I'm a wuss?

688
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:40,188
He made you miss
Thanksgiving dinner.

689
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:50,565
<i>Vitamin B12 deficiency?</i>

690
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,667
Gives us anemia,
numbness.

691
00:31:52,735 --> 00:31:53,868
<i>Not a stroke.
If he has
a vascular malformation--</i>

692
00:31:53,936 --> 00:31:57,472
Anemia's not macrocytic.

693
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,808
Sorry to
inconvenience you.

694
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,109
<i>Dying patients
can be so thoughtless.</i>

695
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:02,110
Don't.

696
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:04,112
Great comeback.

697
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,680
<i>Is that oscar wilde?</i>

698
00:32:05,748 --> 00:32:07,148
<i>Come on, people.
Bone marrow
malignancy.</i>

699
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,616
Wouldn't produce
schistocytes.

700
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:10,585
Lupus.

701
00:32:10,653 --> 00:32:13,521
Gee, thanks for coming in.
ANA was negative.

702
00:32:13,589 --> 00:32:14,889
<i>What about you?</i>

703
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:16,991
<i>Got any predictable drivel
you'd like to add?</i>

704
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:18,426
I think they've
given you enough already.

705
00:32:18,494 --> 00:32:19,861
<i>Well, at least
they're trying.</i>

706
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:21,729
They're not just sitting there
like roadkill.

707
00:32:21,797 --> 00:32:24,032
<i>Give me something.</i>

708
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:26,734
Give me something,
or I'll get your ex-Smarter half

709
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:28,703
<i>On the phone
and ask her.</i>

710
00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:30,605
<i>House.</i>

711
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:05,359
You're gonna be
pressing charges?

712
00:33:05,427 --> 00:33:07,461
Against the ottoman
i tripped over?

713
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,630
<i>Against Chase.</i>

714
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:13,234
I'm pretty sure the ottoman
was acting alone.

715
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:15,336
You free for dinner
this weekend?

716
00:33:15,404 --> 00:33:17,405
At least three other people
saw him do it.

717
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:19,340
Mass hysteria.
Either night?

718
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:21,342
I can't have doctors
punching each other out.

719
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,944
Oh, my god,
who got punched?

720
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:25,980
And more importantly,
for Chase's sake,

721
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:27,249
I need to know if he's
able to handle himself

722
00:33:27,817 --> 00:33:29,417
<i>or if I should be
getting him some help.</i>

723
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:31,787
Chase couldn't have
punched anyone.

724
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:33,588
<i>He was with me when
i tripped over the ottoman.</i>

725
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:35,524
If you're not planning on eating
this weekend, maybe a movie?

726
00:33:35,591 --> 00:33:38,560
I'm not doing this,
House.

727
00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:40,529
<i>It's not fun anymore.</i>

728
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:42,764
Just do your job.

729
00:33:56,645 --> 00:33:59,346
I need your help.

730
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:01,982
What happened
to your face?

731
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,952
I was mowing the lawn
when the phone rang.

732
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,487
<i>You're a computer.</i>

733
00:34:06,055 --> 00:34:07,121
<i>I'm gonna feed you data,</i>

734
00:34:07,189 --> 00:34:08,556
And you analyze it.

735
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:09,657
What, are you
gonna feed me

736
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:11,259
20 years of medical
knowledge too?

737
00:34:11,327 --> 00:34:13,761
It's not gonna work.

738
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:16,364
I know.

739
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:21,469
But I don't have
anyone else to ask.

740
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:22,937
It's lonely, isn't it?

741
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:27,308
It's not that bad.

742
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:30,878
Then you're not that smart.

743
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:32,513
You ever tried
to kill yourself?

744
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:33,514
Not quickly.

745
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:34,982
<i>I did.</i>

746
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,918
12 years ago I jumped off

747
00:34:36,985 --> 00:34:38,386
the top of
my eight-story building

748
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:41,122
into a dumpster bin
the day before pickup.

749
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,361
<i>I broke my collarbone,
my leg, and three ribs.</i>

750
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:49,330
When I was in the hospital
they put me on narcotics

751
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:52,800
and suddenly everything
was just better.

752
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:57,905
<i>I didn't feel
isolated or lonely.</i>

753
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:00,041
<i>That's where
i met my wife.</i>

754
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:03,344
She was so happy.

755
00:35:03,412 --> 00:35:06,581
And dumb.

756
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:09,584
And I was...

757
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,319
Smart...

758
00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:14,422
<i>And miserable.</i>

759
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,091
<i>You tell me
who the genius is.</i>

760
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,229
<i>I fell in love with her
buzzed out of my head,</i>

761
00:35:21,296 --> 00:35:24,399
and I knew I wanted
to stay that way forever.

762
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:34,308
<i>Enjoy.</i>

763
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:38,713
Easier on your conscience
if I die an idiot?

764
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:41,883
What's a conscience?

765
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:52,493
Which ribs...

766
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:54,395
<i>Did you break
in the fall?</i>

767
00:35:54,463 --> 00:35:56,197
They on the left side?

768
00:35:56,265 --> 00:35:57,832
Yeah, bottom three.

769
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,037
<i>That was 12 years ago.</i>

770
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:06,240
This probably
cost me my marriage,

771
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:07,942
so it better be awesome.

772
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,844
Ferrous oxide contrast?

773
00:36:09,912 --> 00:36:11,112
<i>Gets absorbed
by the spleen.</i>

774
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,615
Unless he doesn't
have one.

775
00:36:14,683 --> 00:36:17,285
In which case It's absorbed
by the liver, and fries that.

776
00:36:17,352 --> 00:36:18,820
You're killing him?

777
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:20,955
You think I opened him up
and didn't take out his spleen?

778
00:36:21,023 --> 00:36:24,559
All organs do look kind of
the same--red and squishy.

779
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:31,232
Oh, my god.

780
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,234
Accessory spleens.

781
00:36:33,302 --> 00:36:36,003
Okay, that is amazing.

782
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,005
12 years, eight stories,
and a dumpster ago,

783
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,574
<i>He broke three ribs,</i>

784
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:40,842
Damaged his spleen.

785
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:42,577
Bits of it split off,

786
00:36:42,644 --> 00:36:43,811
Circulated through
his bloodstream

787
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:45,279
Until they landed
and attached somewhere else.

788
00:36:45,347 --> 00:36:48,683
So it is TTP.

789
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,552
I just didn't remove...

790
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,387
All of his spleens.

791
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:56,357
16 splenectomies.

792
00:36:56,425 --> 00:37:02,196
Pretty sure he gets
a set of steak knives with that.

793
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:14,842
<i>I can outrun you.</i>

794
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,045
Sorry about the nose.
And the eye. And the, uh...

795
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:21,282
Eyebrow.

796
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,717
Guess I deserved it.

797
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:25,086
Well, if I thought that,
i wouldn't be apologizing.

798
00:37:25,153 --> 00:37:27,388
Your fist slipped?

799
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:32,760
Everybody kept bugging me,
asking if I was okay.

800
00:37:32,828 --> 00:37:38,666
So you busted my nose
to keep people off your back.

801
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:40,234
Pretty much.

802
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:42,169
Making people even more
worried about you.

803
00:37:42,237 --> 00:37:43,504
<i>Maybe.</i>

804
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:47,608
But at least they're not
talking to me about it.

805
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:48,910
Fair enough.

806
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,912
Cheers.

807
00:37:59,388 --> 00:38:00,922
Thank you.

808
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:02,557
Don't be so grateful.

809
00:38:02,624 --> 00:38:06,494
You'll be delivering packages
for 70 years to pay for it.

810
00:38:06,562 --> 00:38:09,664
Well, uh,
thanks for our talk.

811
00:38:09,731 --> 00:38:10,998
<i>It's been a while
since I had</i>

812
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:12,466
<i>A stimulating conversation.</i>

813
00:38:12,534 --> 00:38:13,467
So what're you gonna do?

814
00:38:13,535 --> 00:38:14,869
Go back to my life.

815
00:38:14,937 --> 00:38:16,437
Which one?

816
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:21,142
The one that has
my wife in it.

817
00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:23,377
<i>Robotripping.</i>

818
00:38:23,445 --> 00:38:25,313
How's she feel
about that?

819
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,847
<i>Well, she doesn't
have to know.</i>

820
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:29,650
It's worked for 12 years.

821
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,925
Tell your brain
I said good-bye.

822
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:48,502
Einstein's giving
himself a lobotomy,

823
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:52,206
And you're
cool with that?

824
00:38:52,274 --> 00:38:57,578
Ignorance is bliss.

825
00:38:57,646 --> 00:39:01,215
Hold that pose.

826
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:07,622
I'll start with
T-shirts and mugs,

827
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:09,657
And see how it goes.

828
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:20,401
Home early.

829
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:24,372
<i>What happened to him?</i>

830
00:39:27,943 --> 00:39:28,976
You beat up House?

831
00:39:29,044 --> 00:39:30,978
Just one right hook.

832
00:39:31,046 --> 00:39:32,480
Why? What happened?

833
00:39:32,547 --> 00:39:33,814
<i>You were right.</i>

834
00:39:33,882 --> 00:39:35,650
I told him we need
to lay down some ground rules,

835
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:37,184
<i>Got a little heated.</i>

836
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:39,520
That's not what I meant.

837
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:40,821
Is he okay?

838
00:39:40,889 --> 00:39:42,657
<i>Are you gonna be fired?
Arrested?</i>

839
00:39:42,724 --> 00:39:46,227
Everything's fine.

840
00:39:46,294 --> 00:39:47,561
Wow.

841
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:07,782
Dr. Cuddy.

842
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:16,590
Can we at least be civil?

843
00:40:16,658 --> 00:40:18,659
How's your nose?

844
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:20,127
It's okay.

845
00:40:20,195 --> 00:40:22,697
Does your kid
like animals?

846
00:40:22,764 --> 00:40:25,199
I got tickets to
that holiday carnival.

847
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:27,635
I hear they have
a nice petting zoo.

848
00:40:27,703 --> 00:40:30,538
I think I was
pretty clear before.

849
00:40:30,605 --> 00:40:33,107
I don't mean with me.

850
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:36,711
Here. Take 'em. Enjoy.

851
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:40,247
No, thanks.

852
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:43,050
They're not fake.
I didn't steal them.

853
00:40:43,118 --> 00:40:46,787
One of the nurses was selling
'em for her kid's scout trip.

854
00:40:46,855 --> 00:40:48,656
I know it doesn't make
things right between us,

855
00:40:48,724 --> 00:40:53,828
But I just wanted
to do something nice.

856
00:40:53,895 --> 00:40:58,265
I don't want them.

857
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,967
Okay.

858
00:41:00,035 --> 00:41:02,903
I'll see you tomorrow.

859
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:15,316
They didn't split up.

860
00:41:15,383 --> 00:41:16,817
She wouldn't
take the tickets.

861
00:41:16,885 --> 00:41:19,253
Of course.

862
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:22,022
Windtalker code for
"we never split up."

863
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,824
House, she told you
multiple times

864
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:25,359
she wants nothing
to do with you.

865
00:41:25,427 --> 00:41:27,361
I wasn't gonna be there.

866
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:30,064
She just felt guilty
that I felt guilty,

867
00:41:30,132 --> 00:41:32,233
<i>So she couldn't
take them.</i>

868
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,335
Either that or she didn't
want to appease you.

869
00:41:34,402 --> 00:41:36,504
These weren't
reparations.

870
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:38,572
Just a simple
gesture of remorse,

871
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,441
and she slapped it down.

872
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:44,211
They didn't break up.

873
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:49,049
She just wanted me
to think that so I'd back off.

874
00:41:49,117 --> 00:41:53,487
Dare I ask
what you're gonna do?

875
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,756
Nothing.

876
00:41:55,824 --> 00:41:58,259
I said they'd either break up
or they'd stay together.

877
00:41:58,326 --> 00:42:01,395
They didn't break up.

878
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:04,231
And you're
okay with that?

879
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:07,802
It is what it is.

880
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:11,705
Good for you.

881
00:42:11,773 --> 00:42:15,342
Aah.

882
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:20,881
House knows I lied.

883
00:42:20,949 --> 00:42:23,918
Why? What'd he say?

884
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:25,820
Nothing.
I could just tell.

885
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:27,454
You want to stage
another breakup?

886
00:42:27,522 --> 00:42:29,056
No.

887
00:42:29,124 --> 00:42:31,926
Oh, hi.

888
00:42:31,993 --> 00:42:34,595
It seems like he's
gonna leave us alone.

889
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:37,398
Why would he do that?

890
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:39,797
I'm not completely sure.

891
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:44,798
So, we have his blessing?

892
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:46,799
I guess so.

893
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,800
Maybe House isn't so bad after all.

894
00:42:58,101 --> 00:42:59,801
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

895
00:42:59,802 --> 00:43:06,802
