not be a bite,

get there on your own.

it is dioxin?

binds to the poison,

around there for a while.

it wasn't more priests
we wanted.

simpler explanation
for you firing me.

break up with me,

but you were too weak
to do it yourself.

She was a trade unionist.

Dibala's Youth
Labor League.

156
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,200
He pretends it's
to get young people
off the street,

157
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,835
but he takes teenage boys
from the provinces

158
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,903
and feeds them
drugs and alcohol

159
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,642
and teaches them
how to torture.

160

00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,648
which rules it out.

349
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,153
Staph aureus?

350
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,147
CHASE: No.

351
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:18,189
Because he smokes?

352
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,763
He's miming
a thermometer.

353
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,462
He says the fever's
not high enough.

354
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,530
So some other infection.

355
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,697
FOREMAN: He's wrong.

356
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,264
The fever could be
misleading us into
thinking infection.

357
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,604
(EXHALES)

358
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,571
Talk.

359
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,281
It could all fit
with lymphoma.

360
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,323
I need you to
spread your legs
so I can do an "H".

361
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:53,763
Can't be lymphoma.
LDH is normal.

362
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:54,958
He's got good
liver function,

363
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,160
it's masking
the elevated levels.

364
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,761
Biopsy the lymph node.
Check it out.

365
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,102
Makes sense.
Guess you don't need me.

366
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,771
Oh. By the way,
you might want to
close the blinds.

367
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,340
It's really bright
in here.

368
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,719
It's just
a wild coincidence

369
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,456
that he thought
you were a rude jerk.

370
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,862
Come on, give me
the benefit of the doubt.

371
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,832
You said he's a jerk.
I barely talked.

372
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,266
You talked!

373
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,561
(SIGHS)

374
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,368
All I wanted was to
sip morning espresso

375
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,271
next to a peaceful,
burbling fountain.

376
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,106
You could be
sipping Courvoisier

377
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,272
next to a replica
of the Playboy grotto

378
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,178
if you tell him
what you got on him.

379
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,944
I don't have
anything on him.

380
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,212
I don't want
anything on him.

381
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,686
Closest he's been
to Vietnam,

382
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,952
ordering the Mee Krob
at that place on the corner.

383
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,424
Mee Krob is
from Thailand.

384
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,551
Exactly.

385
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,891
What did you do?
Why do you think
he's faking?

386
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,157
I saw his mail.

387
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,289
You broke in?

388
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:05,496
No. He was holding it.
Private medical insurance,
not from the VA.

389
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,738
Plus he's gotta
be early 50s.

390
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,037
He's too young
to be a vet.
So, I looked further.

391
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,098
You did break in.

392
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,269
Online.

393
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,209
There's no reference to him
in any of the vet records.

394
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,646
Why would he fake
being a veteran?

395
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,980
Well, just look
how you're acting.

396
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,078
People have been
tiptoeing around
this jerk for years.

397
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,783
Normally, we'd all
tell the amputee
to go screw himself.

398
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,849
Victims get pity.
Heroes get adulation.
It's way better.

399
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,986
Thank you for trying
to help me out
with my neighbor.

400
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,325
Now forget
the Vietnam stuff.

401
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,489
I could prove this.

402
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,328
But you won't because
you'll be too busy

403
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,890
writing him
a letter of apology

404
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,302
and dropping it at his door,
without knocking at his door.

405
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,932
I didn't do anything.
That guy's a total ass.

406
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,239
Which is the point.
It's easy to be nice
to people you like,

407
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:50,304
but being nice to
people you hate,
that's a skill. Do it.

408
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,782
Thank you
for saving my life.

409
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,683
The man that
tried to kill you,

410
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,057
he said that you were
preparing a massacre.

411
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,234
The Sitibi are
my countrymen.

412
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,430
I am fighting
a guerrilla war.

413
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,996
In a way that's
being called genocide.

414
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:22,278
Twenty years ago,
these same Sitibi rebels
took over the south.

415
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,781
They massacred
tens of thousands,

416
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,613
and they would
happily do it again.

417
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,620
I'm trying to impose order.

418
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,817
I'm trying to prevent
a genocide. Genocide.

419
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:42,022
My own son, my youngest,
he is a student here.

420
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,829
He hasn't
spoken to me in years

421
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,700
because of what he read
in your newspapers.

422
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,900
But what he read
is not true.

423
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,443
What about your
Youth Labor League?

424
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,110
(EXCLAIMS
IN DISAPPOINTMENT)

425
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,176
There, I was at fault.

426
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:07,450
I hired men who,
in their zeal,
stepped over the line,

427
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,523
and there were abuses.

428
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,462
But that will
not happen again.

429
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,542
Hello?

430
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,541
How's it going?

431
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,550
Normal-Iooking nucleus.

432
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,483
How's it going
with you?

433
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,611
It worried me
when you joked

434
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,086
about letting that man
shoot Dibala.

435
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,817
I wasn't joking.

436
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,792
You can't want
to kill anyone,

437
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,884
especially not
your own patient.

438
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,485
It's only natural
to feel...

439
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,155
No, it's completely
unnatural.

440
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,823
Only psychopaths
can kill other people

441
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,458
without having some
sort of breakdown.

442
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,366
Not when it's justified.
Look at soldiers.

443
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,871
Even when
it's justified.

444
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,499
Am I trying to
kill our patient?
Of course not.

445
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,202
But if he died,
am I supposed
to just pretend

446
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,007
that wouldn't be good
for the world?

447
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:12,682
The cells are
neatly differentiated.
This isn't lymphoma.

448
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,156
I thought I had detected
the sickly sweet smell
of maple syrup

449
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,623
and socialized medicine.

450
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:21,716
(SLURPING)

451
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,785
It smells like victory.

452
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,300
That big flag in your place
prompted me to chat
with your housekeeper.

453
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,098
Turns out you're a citizen
of the Great White North.

454
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,570
You broke into
my apartment?

455
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,972
Technically, no.
Well, technically, yeah,

456
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,567
but two steps,
hardly...

457
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,668
You're going to jail.

458
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,542
Speaking of,
you know what
can get you

459
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,549
six months and
a $100,000 fine?

460
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,080
Falsely claiming
that you won a medal
in Vietnam.

461
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,246
You think I'm faking?

462
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,985
Canada did not send troops
to fight in Vietnam,
you idiot.

463
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,389
They sent troops
to reinforce
the '73 Peace Accords,

464
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,628
which is where
I tried to free
a 12-year-old boy

465
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,636
who stepped
on a land mine.

466
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,366
Thirty-six years later,
every second I feel pain
in my hand

467
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,101
like I'm still grabbing
that boy's arm

468
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,735
even though
my arm isn't there.

469
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,678
So, no, I'm not faking.

470
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,408
Oh.

471
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,781
On a related note,
go Maple Leafs.

472
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,301
Did you get
the biopsy results?

473
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,495
Is it lymphoma?

474
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,661
No.

475
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,603
So we have to move on.

476
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,573
Infection,
perhaps autoimmune...

477
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,702
Did you get
the biopsy results?

478
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,678
Yes, I just told you.

479
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,374
Is it lymphoma?

480
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,450
Cameron and Chase?

481
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,352
They both really
like diagnostics,

482
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:02,086
and I think they both
really like watching
House torture me.

483
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,493
Anyway, thank you
for understanding
about the job.

484
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,901
I had two really
crappy alternatives.

485
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,199
There was a third.

486
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,466
What's that?

487
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,404
You could have
stepped aside.

488
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,976
(LAUGHING) We both would
have lost our jobs.

489
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,139
You could have
asked Cameron or Chase
to take your place.

490
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,442
They wouldn't
have wanted to.

491
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,644
You just said
they both really
like diagnostics.

492
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,419
You want to
go back in time?

493
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,479
I want to
make this work.

494
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,585
I want to understand you.
I mean, you know
how you made me feel.

495
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,490
If you could
do it again...

496
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,393
I made the right decision.

497
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,875
I need your confidential
medical opinion.

498
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,786
Is the President capable
of thinking clearly?

499
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,558
Obviously not right now.

500
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,721
Will he ever be?

501
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,963
I think...

502
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,728
Neurons don't grow back,
and he's already
in his decline.

503
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,163
Anything he tells you,
any command he gives,
how will you ever know

504
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,199
it's not just
the delusions of a sick,
mad, dying, old man?

505
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,921
(OVER INTERCOM)
<i>He just started</i>
<i>spiking a fever.</i>

506
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,456
It's scleroderma.

507
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,889
You don't have
some clever way
of telling me this time?

508
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,527
Patient's dying.
I'm done with clever.

509
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,470
Look at his skin.
It's tight for
a 75-year-old.

510
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,736
Based on
his admission photo?
Bit subjective.

511
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,333
Fever points
to infection.

512
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,902
And now he's got
nodules on his fingers.
That's blastomycosis.

513
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,711
Nodules? You're calling
tight skin subjective?

I'm with Foreman.

515
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,546
We would have
seen fungus balls
on the head CT.

516
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,053
Fungal lesions
can be missed.

517
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,179

settle this with a test.

would point to scleroderma.

519
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,722
Point to, not prove.
And his fever's too high.
We have to treat him now.

520
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:20,231
If we treat wrong,
we could send this
disease into overdrive.

521
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,788
You're with me on
the scleroderma?

522
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,766
I guess.
I just don't care enough
about the patient

523
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,564
to waste my time trying
to convince anyone.
We get it.

524
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,764
You don't like the guy,
you don't want to
work on this case.

525
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,204
And yet
you're still here.

526
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,332
Why don't you
take a stand?

527
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,171
Either do something
about it or shut up.

528
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,643
Treat him for blasto
if you want.

529
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,745
I'll get Cuddy.
I can convince her to...

530
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,340
This isn't a democracy.

531
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,850
I don't care who you get.

532
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,615
At least for right now,
this is my department.

533
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:44,882
We're treating
him for blasto.

534
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,424
Start him
on amphotericin B.

535
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,636

with an air bubble.

536

537
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,362

another heart attack.

538

539

Let her go.

540
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:09,610
You tell my colonel
I'm a sick, dying old man
who can't be trusted.

541
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,705
I didn't say...

542
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,647
You were trying to
put a gun in his hand

543
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:16,483
and point it at my head.
The gun is now in your hand.

544
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,990
That is
a practical difference,
not a moral one.

545
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,856
If you want me dead,
then pull the trigger.

546
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,893
It is not so easy
when you have to
do it yourself.

547
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,875

548
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,323
I guess I didn't
want you dead.

549
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,399
If you touch
my wife again,

550
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,198
I'll kick your ass
out onto the street.

551
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,499
I don't care
who you are.

552
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,770
I did her a favor.
I showed her
her true character.

553
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,242
She's a better person
than you are.

554
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,008
She is too weak to
act on her beliefs.

555
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:21,173
But that is not her fault.
Almost everyone is.

556

Even my own advisers,
my own colonel.

557
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:31,726
All they do is
negotiate and debate
and sign treaties.

558

They are appeasers.

and that makes you a man.
And men make choices.

to send bands of drunk,

an entire people?

577

press charges,

578

you'd leave.

You're kicking me out?

580
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,001
I'll explain it
to your psychiatrist,

581
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,775
but, yeah, you gotta
go somewhere else.

582
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,377

when things go wrong,

583

and get more involved.

you could go to jail.

a blood sample.

588

antibody test.

Why are you
doing this now?

591
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,643
Because I didn't
want to kill him.

592
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,880
And you're right.
I have to take a side.

593
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,689

what I can to
keep him alive.

Positive for

596
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,999
We gotta get him
off the anti-fungals

597

and onto steroids
immediately.

599

This only points
to scleroderma.
It doesn't prove it.

600

You're just gonna
ignore the test?

to rerun the antibodies test.

690
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,122
You ran it twice.

691
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,422
Turns out,
I couldn't get in.

692
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,620
They had
an armed guard.

693
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,288
But I saw this.

694
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,030
It's a sign-in sheet
from the morgue.

695
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:05,100
Your signature,
9:45 this morning.

696
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,201
That's right before
you guys ran the test.

697
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,071
What were you
doing there?

698
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,944
Follow-up on
a clinic case.

699
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,314
What case?

700
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,409
You think this is
really important?

701
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,919
One of the patients
in the morgue

702
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,888
was a 70-year-old woman
who had scleroderma.

703
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:24,491
You and Cameron,
if you took
that woman's blood,

704
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,393
you could have
messed up the test results

705
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,695
so we treated Dibala
for the wrong disease.

706
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,460
Cameron had nothing
to do with it.

707
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,199
You son of a bitch!

708
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,764
He was going to
kill the Sitibi,

709
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,101
every last one of them.

710
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,339
I don't care what
he was gonna do.

711
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:46,577
He came to us
and put his life
in our hands.

712
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,743
All the good we've done,

713
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:54,118
every life we've saved,
it would have meant nothing

714
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,991
if we just sent him off
to kill hundreds of
thousands of people.

715
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,654
Look at the news.

716
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,059
The moderates
are taking over.

717
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,465
There's hope
for peace talks.

718
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,704
You tell the world
that I faked this test,

719
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,506
Dibala becomes a martyr.
The massacres begin.

720
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,870
I cover this up,
I become your accomplice.

721
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,576
You think you can
guilt me into that?

722
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,583
If the cops are
going to come for me,

723
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,584
please warn me

724
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,263
so that I can
tell my wife first.

725
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,437
Chase,

726
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,007
you really think
you can kill
another human being

727
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,672
without any consequences
to yourself?

728
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,381
No.

729
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,424
(TELEVISION CHATTERING)

730
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,889
My neighbor called.

731
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,798
He sounded happy.

732
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,265
That's nice.

733
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,899
Even nicer, he's approving
the garden expansion.

734
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,335
Huh.

735
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,004
And even more nicer,

736
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,513
he's not going
to press charges,

737
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,277
even if you
don't move out.

738
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,619
What did you do to him?

739
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:31,819
I was nice.

740
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,183
You really want
to know?

741
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:43,466
I think I want to
give you the benefit
of the doubt.

742
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,205
WOMAN ON TV: <i>Alligators' main</i>
<i>prey is smaller animals</i>

743
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,969
<i>that they can kill and</i>
<i>eat with a single bite.</i>

744
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,573
BOTH: Oh!

745
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,373
HOUSE: (LAUGHING) Oh!
