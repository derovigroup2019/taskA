1
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,700
Help!

2
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:36,000
Help me!

3
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:39,733
Dry heaves are gone,
so am I.

4
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,367
I'll check
with the doctor.

5
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:42,833
No, no, no, no.

6
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm here voluntarily,
just got to check with me.

7
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:48,900
I'm sorry. Dr. Nolan left
specific instructions.

8
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,301
She's not sick. She's scared.
So tell her to tell--

9
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:55,367
<i>wow.</i>

10
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:59,067
And he's black.

11
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:02,700
I thought you'd be a little more
sensitive on the slavery issue.

12
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,467
Can't keep me.

13
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:17,733
Dr. House,
you look a lot better.

14
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,167
<i>I am a lot better--</i>

15
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:20,634
No painkillers,
no hallucinations.

16
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,900
Leg hurts,
but it's manageable.

17
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,501
<i>Great job.</i>

18
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:24,867
Gonna miss you.

19
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:26,700
Want to start missing you
as soon as possible.

20
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:28,568
Well, legally, you're free to go
whenever you want.

21
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:29,934
But I suggest you stay.

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,301
I'll take it
under advisement.

23
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:32,601
If you thought
the hallucinations

24
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:34,034
Were from your
vicodin problem,

25
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,501
Why didn't you just check
yourself into a rehab facility?

26
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:39,000
I was deluded into thinking
I might be crazy.

27
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,401
But you had been abusing vicodin
for years.

28
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,334
<i>Never had delusions,
never had trouble sleeping,</i>

29
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:44,568
<i>Never had any problems,</i>

30
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:47,267
Other than narcissism
and antisocial behavior,

31
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:49,301
Until two colleagues died.

32
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,934
Your father died.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,634
<i>Your issues</i>

34
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,201
Run deeper
than vicodin.

35
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,334
Well, that's not gonna
cheer me up, is it?

36
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,501
You need to be transferred
to our long-Term ward,

37
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:01,467
Started on medication,
talk therapy--

38
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:02,800
Yeah, I get it.

39
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,534
Uh, just one thing
I'm getting hung up on.

40
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:07,334
I can leave
whenever I want.

41
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:09,234
How about I start
with that?

42
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:12,301
You can't go back
to practicing medicine.

43
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:18,867
I don't want
to practice medicine.

44
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:20,467
I've decided
I want to be an astronaut.

45
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:23,467
Well, if you want
your state astronaut's license,

46
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,167
You're gonna need
my recommendation.

47
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:29,067
Is that a popular,
new treatment--

48
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:30,434
Blackmail?

49
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,700
You need to get better.

50
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:40,334
Welcome to ward six.

51
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:55,167
So brass tacks--
What do I have to do,

52
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:56,867
And how long
do I have to be here?

53
00:04:56,934 --> 00:05:00,100
Depends on you.
Process is pretty basic.

54
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,301
If you follow the schedule,
agree to take meds,

55
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:05,634
Participate in group
and individual therapy,

56
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,534
We can work on goals.
I set a goal.

57
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,800
Excellent.
What is it?

58
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,334
My goal is to get your boss

59
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:12,534
To write the letter
that I want him to write.

60
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:14,000
Now let's talk process.

61
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,668
I can smile through
gritted teeth and play nice,

62
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,067
But there are serious risks
of violence

63
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,467
Involved in that choice,

64
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:21,867
So I'm going with turning
this ward upside down,

65
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:24,134
<i>Making you
and your boss' job and life</i>

66
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:25,534
So unmanageable
that he'll write

67
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:27,100
Whatever he has to write
to get rid of me.

68
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,568
He's all set.

69
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,000
Thanks.

70
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:45,000
<i>I've never been
in the end unit before.</i>

71
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:47,767
<i>Yo, I don't need an escort.
Get off me.</i>

72
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,067
Who are you?

73
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:50,134
You believe these guys?

74
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:51,634
Lecturing me
on manic depression,

75
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,134
Like I couldn't write
a book or two.

76
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:55,668
I stop taking my meds, because
I want to stop taking my meds,

77
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,334
Because nothing
is wrong with me.

78
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:59,668
No reason to keep
dragging me back here.

79
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,668
<i>When I'm on them,
everything slows down.</i>

80
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,034
<i>That's when
the problem is.</i>

81
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,267
Hey, nice to see you.

82
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:05,767
My roommate last time
couldn't stand me.

83
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,934
Really?

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,067
I'm juan alvarez.
J.A.'S my stage name.

85
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:11,301
But alvie's what everybody
around here calls me,

86
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,434
<i>Like the woody allen character
in, uh, annie hall,</i>

87
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:15,867
But the puerto rican version
and not as neurotic.

88
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:18,934
So what do I call you?

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,234
You're actually waiting
for an answer this time.

90
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:22,367
You can call me House.

91
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:23,634
Ow!

92
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,900
* he's a brick *

93
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,501
* House *

94
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:30,201
Hey, wait up.

95
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,100
I've already got
the whole place wired,

96
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,401
So I'll give you
the rundown.

97
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:34,700
Yo, everybody!

98
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:37,534
This is my new roommate,
House, y'all.

99
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:38,601
Main thing
you got to know--

100
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:39,733
Is this the line?

101
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,067
Hey, gabby, meet
my new roommate, House.

102
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:43,601
You can call him "heezy."

103
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:44,800
No, you can't.

104
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:46,301
Don't worry.
She won't call you anything.

105
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,733
She hasn't talked in, like,
ten years or something.

106
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,501
Good you came here.

107
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:52,534
<i>You need to know
the lay of the land.</i>

108
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:54,000
I need to request
a new room.

109
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,467
Ha ha.
You're funny.

110
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:57,267
You're also gonna come here
to get your meds.

111
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,467
I'm not on any meds.

112
00:06:58,534 --> 00:06:59,833
You either?
Good for you.

113
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,601
Tell me my mind
works too fast.

114
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:04,067
Probably tell usain bolt
he runs too fast.

115
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:05,668
Excuse me.

116
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:08,334
I know you're busy ignoring me,
but my minibar is empty.

117
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:10,334
You think bolt could do
the long jump?

118
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,700
That sport
needs to evolve.

119
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,800
Had the same world record
for, like, 20 years.

120
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,334
I think if one guy launched
himself headfirst

121
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:17,900
And right before
he hits the ground

122
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,501
Does a front flip instead,

123
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:20,934
Get three extra feet
out of that, easy.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,833
Go be that man.

125
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,167
Aah!

126
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,900
Aah!
My head!

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,601
My head!
Oh!

128
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:34,067
You're not getting
any haldol.

129
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:36,900
Sorry.

130
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:39,100
<i>That's Hal.
His real name is Connor,</i>

131
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,668
But we call him hal,
because he--
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got it.

132
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:43,301
We can't play that.

133
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,367
They keep it locked up.

134
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:46,668
I wish we could,
but at the same time,

135
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,800
You can imagine
how annoying that could be.

136
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,234
Crazy people playing on it
all the time--

137
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,800
We'd never get any peace.

138
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:53,434
Come on, I want to introduce you
to everybody.

139
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,668
Do you think
he's serious?

140
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,134
He's a doctor.

141
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,434
He knows that acting out will
only reinforce our diagnosis.

142
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,067
<i>or it'll work.</i>

143
00:08:02,134 --> 00:08:03,767
You actually think
this is something

144
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,267
We should be
concerned about?

145
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,733
A patient makes a threat,
you should always be concerned.

146
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:17,568
<i>There are two new additions
to our ward.</i>

147
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:19,067
<i>You all know alvie.</i>

148
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,934
Thank you, thank you.
Hold your applause.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
It's great to be back here
in mayfield,

150
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:24,134
Not just for the food,

151
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:25,767
<i>Not just
for the ladies--</i>

152
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,234
Well, okay,
maybe just for the ladies.

153
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:30,568
And you should also welcome greg
to the floor.

154
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:33,501
Don't worry about the name.
I'm just passing through.

155
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:35,534
Don't want to break
any hearts.

156
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:36,634
Can we go outside now?

157
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,067
Not now, jay.

158
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:39,534
So he's
claustrophobic, right?

159
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:40,967
You're claustrophobic?

160
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:43,234
Can I get a pen
to write this stuff down?

161
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,000
Where are
you going?

162
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,067
Where's
he going?

163
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:48,100
It's okay.

164
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,568
Paranoid-
-Check.

165
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,867
<i>Dr. Beasley...</i>

166
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:53,867
I am having an issue
with the food.

167
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,201
<i>What's the problem?</i>

168
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,634
<i>I swear I'm eating
less and less,</i>

169
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,767
And I just keep getting
bigger and bigger.

170
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,434
A crayon?
Anybody?

171
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,634
We'll talk
about it another time.

172
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,401
<i>I understand you all</i>

173
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:06,867
Had art therapy
yesterday.

174
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:08,668
Maybe we can hang some
of the new pieces on the wall.

175
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,800
Cut your wrists, huh?

176
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:11,833
Greg, there
are certain topics--

177
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,867

359
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,267
No.

It's group time, greg.

361

Why isn't she talking?

362
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
She needs help.

363
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:46,800
She needs somebody
to save her.

364

Working on your next elaborate
plan to get out of here.

370
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:11,301
Why don't you put the plan
on hold for a few days?

371
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,301
See what happens.

372
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:15,367
Just let me do my job.

with my new scheme.

379

388
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,800
Is that true?

389
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:54,367
Yeah. And now I can use the
third-Floor vending machines.

391
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,634
I mean, the whole point
is the dipping.

392
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,601
Sure, we save time by not adding
the mix and sour cream,

393

Go into nolan's office.

00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:11,034
I need the name of the woman
he met with at 11:00 today.

No problem. And I'll get you
some old-School chips.

If they have them,
I'll get you some dip,

But I've never seen dip
in the vending machine.

404
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:18,167
Yes, get me

00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,568
She sways.

530
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:57,967
It might be significant.

531
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,833
Are you ignoring me,

532
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,934
Or are you just letting
my charm wash over you?

533
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:09,867
<i>Kind of tough
to play and chat.</i>

534
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:12,334
A couple of weeks ago,
you told me

535
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:15,100
Playing to her
was a complete waste of time.

536
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:17,267
You're right.
Your playing does get worse

537
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:20,067
<i>When you talk.</i>

538
00:28:20,134 --> 00:28:22,100
I assume she loved music.

539
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,967
She played for
the philadelphia philharmonic--

540
00:28:25,034 --> 00:28:26,234
Cello.

541
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:27,934
Well, if she responded
to the piano,

542
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,467
She might respond even better
to the cello.

543
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:32,234
I play a little.

544
00:28:34,401 --> 00:28:35,568
Hmm.

545
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:38,000
Maybe I'll bring one in
tuesday.

546
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:40,700
<i>Thank you.</i>

547
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,800
Different desk,
different doctor.

548
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:48,568
You've been on meds
for a while now.

549
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:50,234
I'll be checking in
with you periodically

550
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:52,201
To see if we need to adjust
your dose.

551
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:54,467
Any dry mouth,
trouble sleeping?

552
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:56,000
Nope.

553
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,634
Can I go now?

554
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,034
<i>There's a manic out there with
a fresh carton of cigarettes,</i>

555
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,367
And he's
a terrible bluffer.

556
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:05,367
It's nice to see that you
and alvie are friends again.

557
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:06,767
Tell me
about your fight.

558
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,767
He hit me.
I hit him back.

559
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,767
Repeat until pulpy.

560
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,967
Alvie told me
you instigated the thing.

561
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:15,201
Well, that tends to be
the way fights work--

562
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:17,601
Different interpretations
of the same circumstances.

563
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:18,733
Very understanding
attitude.

564
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,434
There's that tone again.

565
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:21,534
You're smart.

566
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:24,201
How come every time
you compliment me,

567
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:25,668
It sounds
like an accusation?

568
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:27,067
You're not having
any side effects

569
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:28,367
From your meds,
which is unusual.

570
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,800
It's not
that unusual.

571
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:31,234
The story about the fight
isn't adding up.

572
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:32,534
Why don't you
stop pretending

573
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:34,301
That you haven't reached
a conclusion?

574
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,634
You don't trust me.

575
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,668
Actually, it's
more fundamental than that.

576
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:40,067
You don't like me.
I didn't say that.

577
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:41,568
You think
I'm not taking my meds.

578
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:42,967
Are you?

579
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:44,267
Yes.

580
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:45,833
So what do you
want me to do?

581
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,733
Want me to take
a urine test?

582
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,767
Will that earn
your trust?

583
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:51,700
Actually, yeah.

584
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,568
Have at it.

585
00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:07,100
A little dignity,
please.

586
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,401
You know the rules.
I have to watch.

587
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,167
Yeah, but you don't have to have
courtside seats.

588
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:13,767
Can I at least use a stall?

589
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:22,134
* *

590
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:42,367
* for he himself
has said it *

591
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:47,067
* and it's greatly
to his credit *

592
00:30:47,134 --> 00:30:51,401
* that he is
an englishman *

593
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:55,367
<i>* he I-I-I-I-S *</i>

594
00:30:55,434 --> 00:31:01,234
* an englishman *

595
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,733
Get it
while it's hot.

596
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm sorry
I doubted you.

597
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:38,267
Freedom master,

598
00:31:38,334 --> 00:31:40,434
Think you
could help me out?

599
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:41,534
You need help?

600
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:42,800
Of--Of course.
That's--

601
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:43,800
That's what I do.

602
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:45,067
Great.

603
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:48,100
Could you move
the piano for me?

604
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:51,900
It's 500 pounds.
That's not too much, is it?

605
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:53,934
Well, is there something
trapped underneath or...?

606
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,767
No. I just want to move it
away from the window.

607
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,900
I'm sorry my powers
aren't for frivolous--
Just one quick lift.

608
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,867
Why are you doing that?

609
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:02,301
House, it's none
of your business.

610
00:32:04,234 --> 00:32:05,501
I'm curious.

611
00:32:05,568 --> 00:32:07,234
As a doctor,
what are you doing?

612
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,334
Either he is freedom master,
and he shouldn't be here,

613
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:12,568
Or else he's suffering from
a serious and dangerous delusion

614
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:13,634
That he needs
to deal with.

615
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,334
So...

616
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,534
Legit medical reasons.

617
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:18,900
You're not just trying
to break the guy

618
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:20,234
Because he's
a little different.

619
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:23,201
He's not different.
He's delusional.

620
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:25,668
<i>Can you help me out?
What is she looking at?</i>

621
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:27,833
You're not
a superhero, steven.

622
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,467
You're just
a regular person.
I can save her.

623
00:32:29,534 --> 00:32:31,234
That's okay. We're--We're all
just regular people.

624
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:32,467
It's what we do.

625
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,334
They stole
her voice box.

626
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:36,100
They have it in there.

627
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,434
That's what
she's staring at.

628
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:39,234
<i>That's what
she's staring at.</i>

629
00:32:39,301 --> 00:32:43,000
She's always staring--
Your wife is dead.

630
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:50,234
Good can defeat evil.

631
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,634
Not every time.

632
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,967
Evil people killed a lot
of good people that day.

633
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:55,167
You couldn't save her.
No one could save her.

634
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:58,167
It's in there.

635
00:32:58,234 --> 00:32:59,467
Her voice is in there.

636
00:32:59,534 --> 00:33:01,668
Her voice is in there.

637
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:03,301
Code gray.

638
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:04,634
Her voice is in--

639
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,267
Her voice is in there!

640
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,301
Her voice is in there!

641
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:11,700
<i>Aah!</i>

642
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:14,534
<i>No!</i>

643
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:16,733
Don't do it.

644
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,334
I'm not doing
anything.

645
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:19,800
You're thinking.

646
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:22,767
Things go from thinking to doing
way too fast in this place.

647
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,167
You keep thinking, you're gonna
wind up with no mo in your mojo.

648
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:26,800
I'm thinking
of hitting you again.

649
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:28,700
You hate medina.
You hate all of them.

650
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:30,100
You want to hurt them.

651
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:32,134
You got to keep pretending.
Step away from the hate.

652
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:35,167
What's the difference
between pretending to cooperate

653
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:36,534
And cooperating?

654
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:38,534
Pretending is pretending.
It's not real.

655
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,067
You don't mean it.

656
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:42,900
I sat and watched while he did
something stupid and pointless.

657
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:44,000
I cooperated.

658
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:45,601
In a few days,
you won't have to watch,

659
00:33:45,668 --> 00:33:47,334
Because you're going home.

660
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:48,934
You'll be getting
your job back.

661
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,167
<i>Everybody inside!</i>

662
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:52,767
<i>Closing ceremonies.</i>

663
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:56,100
<i>Everyone attends.
One of you is going home.</i>

664
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:00,833
It's been a great week.

665
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,301
Um, a number of you
have made tremendous strides.

666
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:07,100
<i>But today we're here
to congratulate</i>

667
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,900
Susan.

668
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
We're proud of her!

669
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:16,234
<i>We wish her well,
and we hope</i>

670
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:19,334
to never see her again!

671
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,334
<i>Yeah, isn't it pretty?</i>

672
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,934
And, um, dr. Beasley,
do you want to cut the cake?

673
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,167
<i>Yeah, I'll do that.</i>

674
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:36,668
<i>Okay.</i>

675
00:34:39,634 --> 00:34:40,967
Where's freedom master?

676
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,867
He isn't able
to take part.

677
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:55,534
Get out there.

678
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:57,334
They said everybody
has to get out there.

679
00:34:57,401 --> 00:35:00,067
Talk!
Say something!

680
00:35:00,134 --> 00:35:02,367
Dr. House,
leave him alone.

681
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,534
Did you drug him?

682
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:06,267
Of course
I didn't drug him.

683
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:08,000
He's in flat affect.
He's practically catatonic.

684
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:09,934
Hey, we got cake.

685
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,934
He's fine.
Double chocolate.

686
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,501
<i>Yummy, yummy.
Don't tell me
that he's fine!</i>

687
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:14,467
You did this!

688
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:16,301
He was functioning.

689
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,434
<i>He was happy.
He was delusional.</i>

690
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:19,434
<i>Yeah.</i>

691
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:20,833
He's way better off now.

692
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,067
<i>dr. House...</i>

693
00:35:22,134 --> 00:35:23,534
Let's talk.

694
00:35:30,134 --> 00:35:32,067
Thinking sucks.

695
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm not allowed
to get angry?

696
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:38,800
They screwed him up.

697
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:40,534
And for the record...

698
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:43,000
I am two privilege levels
above susan,

699
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:44,501
And I got the same
depression-Scale score.

700
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:45,434
Every patient
is different.

701
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:46,833
It's not about scores

702
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,867
And levels and--
Happiness
is happiness.

703
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:50,934
The test is the test.
Coping is coping.

704
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,900
And you think you're--
Absolutely!

705
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:56,034
I need to address
some deeper issues,

706
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,301
Which I can do
on an outpatient basis.

707
00:35:58,367 --> 00:35:59,900
Three hours a week?

708
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:01,134
And that's just
my opening offer.

709
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,334
If you want to counter,
I'll likely fold.

710
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:03,401
No.

711
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:06,201
"No" is not
an argument.

712
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:07,167
Are you trying
to frustrate me?

713
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:08,167
No.

714
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,234
"No" again?

715
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,700
I can cope!
I'm coping.

716
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,134
In fact...

717
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,800
I'm coping
better than you think.

718
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:18,900
I've not been taking
my meds,

719
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,434
<i>Not one.</i>

720
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:22,334
And yet, I still scored
a "high functioning"

721
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:23,634
On your depression test.

722
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,733
So your proof of your well-Being
is that you lied?

723
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,167
Manipulated.

724
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:29,733
<i>My proof is</i>

725
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,634
That I can fool the test,
I can fool you,

726
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,733
Which means
I am high functioning.

727
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,867
<i>I am sane,
rational, capable.</i>

728
00:36:34,934 --> 00:36:36,000
I should not be here.

729
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:38,167
These are your pills
from today?

730
00:36:38,234 --> 00:36:39,501
<i>I'm not gonna take it.</i>

731
00:36:39,568 --> 00:36:41,100
I'll just cheek it again.

732
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:45,733
Lick it.

733
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,501
You want me to lick
your hand?

734
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:49,434
I washed.

735
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:55,367
It's sugar.

736
00:36:57,733 --> 00:36:58,767
<i>Your test results</i>

737
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,234
Were improving
too regularly

738
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,034
<i>And too quickly.</i>

739
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,700
I was concerned that
you weren't taking your pills,

740
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:06,234
<i>That it was all an act,</i>

741
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:08,167
So I switched you
to a placebo...

742
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:11,467
<i>To see if your...</i>

743
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:13,833
Improvements
would continue.

744
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,367
<i>Your psych tests
told me nothing,</i>

745
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:18,800
<i>But your urine tests</i>

746
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,167
Told me
you were faking.

747
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:24,100
You need to stop fighting
the system.

748
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:27,934
You need to let me
do my job.

749
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:34,867
So...

750
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:38,067
What's the next plan?

751
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:41,334
There is no new plan.

752
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:42,501
I'm out of plans.

753
00:37:42,568 --> 00:37:44,867
So what do we do?

754
00:37:44,934 --> 00:37:48,034
We stop talking.

755
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:26,467
I see you've got some cello
in your trunk.

756
00:38:26,534 --> 00:38:29,367
And, no,
that's not a euphemism.

757
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:31,067
Are you spying on me?

758
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:32,934
I'm living
in a psychiatric hospital.

759
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,767
Staring out of the window
is what we do.

760
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,601
I assume you'll need help
carrying it up.

761
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:41,134
I still got
grounds privileges.

762
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:44,434
And who's going to carry you
when you're carrying the cello?

763
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:46,867
Yes, cast aside
the useless cripple--

764
00:38:46,934 --> 00:38:49,501
How very german of you.

765
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:52,134
Seriously, the thing
weighs a ton with that case.

766
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:53,434
I think
I'll need a dolly.

767
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:56,634
Or we could ask clark kent
to pitch in.

768
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,634
<i>The dolly's probably easier.</i>

769
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,434
Eh, the dolly...

770
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:02,934
Already feels good
about itself.

771
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,934
He was a happy-Go-Lucky
superhero

772
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,733
<i>Until they told him
he has no powers.</i>

773
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,467
We let him help out,
he feels good about himself.

774
00:39:09,534 --> 00:39:12,601
Might be
less depressed.

775
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:16,634
Why do you put
your life on hold

776
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,134
to visit your sister-In-Law
five times a week?

777
00:39:19,201 --> 00:39:22,401
Am I somehow a bad person
for showing compassion?

778
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:23,467
No.

779
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:24,800
You're not even
a bad person

780
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:27,301
For lying about
why you're doing it.

781
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,167
(House)
oh, that
is impressive.

782
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:33,967
That is
a superhuman feat.

783
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:37,833
Why don't
you take a rest

784
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,367
Before you fly that thing
up to the ward?

785
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,301
He's still depressed.

786
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:48,867
Give me
your car keys.

787
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:51,267
You gonna dangle them in front
of him to entertain him?

788
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:53,668
I'm gonna make him feel
like he's flying.

789
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:55,668
I'll just drive him
around the grounds, top down,

790
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:57,601
Wind in his hair.

791
00:39:57,668 --> 00:40:00,167
Seriously...

792
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,601
You're gonna say no
to that?

793
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:09,134
[Engine turning, revving]

794
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:19,201
Why are you
so nice to me?

795
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:22,067
I think you have
a good heart.

796
00:40:22,134 --> 00:40:24,534
Would you still be nice to me
if I told you that I lied?

797
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:26,301
I'm not just driving

798
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:27,867
Around the grounds
in your convertible.

799
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:29,800
I'm kidnapping him
and stealing your car.

800
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:38,000
You sure?

801
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:39,934
I was just starting to feel
a little heat between us.

802
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,301
Thought we had

803
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:42,568
Kind of a "bonnie and clyde"
thing going there.

804
00:40:42,634 --> 00:40:45,301
Bonnie and clyde
get shot to pieces.

805
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:48,034
[Car door closes]
hmm. See you.

806
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,201
You can do this.

807
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:13,134
If you hold my hand,
I can do it too.

808
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:42,900
Whoo-Hoo!

809
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,267
Whoo!

810
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:47,367
<i>Don't let go!
Aah!</i>

811
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:50,067
Going up!

812
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:53,067
Whoo!

813
00:42:02,568 --> 00:42:05,634
Whoo!
Freedom master's back!

814

<i>Whoo!</i>

815
00:42:07,034 --> 00:42:08,867
<i>Keep it down,
freedom master.
Whoo!</i>

816
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:11,501
You're scaring
the good citizens.

817
00:42:11,568 --> 00:42:13,134
That was the coolest moment
of my life.

818
00:42:13,201 --> 00:42:14,668
It was fun.

819
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:17,301
You can repay me
by telling nolan he's an idiot.

820
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,034
Smell that fresh air

821
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,134
And the warmth
of your yellow sun.

822
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:23,467
We do enjoy it.
[Imitates whooshing]

Come on, get down.

00:42:35,501 --> 00:42:37,301
There's no cry for help.

Thank you, greg.

831

<i>Compound break

Everything in your life has been
about finding the truth.

00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:11,501
But suddenly,
with this guy,

838
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:14,867
You decide to reinforce
a sick man's delusions.

839
00:43:17,234 --> 00:43:19,767
You just wanted to take
a swing at me, hmm?

840
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:22,900
You don't care
about getting out.

841
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,700
You don't care
about him.

842
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:26,900
You don't even care
about the truth.

843
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:31,167
You don't care
about anything, House.

844
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:35,668
I'm transferring you
to winslow psychiatric.

845
00:43:35,733 --> 00:43:37,534
You'll have better luck pulling
the wool over their eyes.

00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:40,234
<i>I'm done.</i>

847
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:41,234
Don't.

848
00:43:46,235 --> 00:43:47,235
I need help.

849
00:44:05,568 --> 00:44:07,000
So how is this
supposed to work?

850
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:09,634
You sit. I sit.
We talk.

851
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,700
About what?
About whatever you want.

852
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:13,700
You want me to whine
about my mother?

853
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:15,467
Do you want to whine
about your mother?

854
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:19,034
I can tell you about the time
I was five and my goldfish died.

855
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,900
If that's where
you'd like to start.

856
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:24,100
I've had a billion things
happen to me in my life.

857
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:25,833
How am I supposed to know
which ones are relevant?

858
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,367
As far as I'm concerned,
they're all relevant.

859
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:28,934
Well, we better get moving,

860
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,067
'Cause this session
could take 50 years.

861
00:44:31,134 --> 00:44:32,301
Yes, you are the sum

862
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:33,833
Of everything
that's happened to you.

863
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,267
And, yes, some events
are more relevant than others.

864
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:40,167
But, uh, the only way
we can figure out which ones are

865
00:44:40,234 --> 00:44:41,867
Is to talk.

866
00:44:41,934 --> 00:44:43,234
So tell me,

867
00:44:43,301 --> 00:44:45,601
What's on your mind?

868
00:44:45,668 --> 00:44:47,000
What do you want?

869
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:53,967
I want to get better...

870
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:56,634
Whatever the hell
that means.

871
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,334
I'm sick
of being miserable.

872
00:44:58,401 --> 00:44:59,700
So you'd like
to be happy?

873
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:02,201
Again with the reflecting--
Yes, I'd like to be happy.

874
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,501
Being happy
is an excellent goal.

875
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,467
Not many patients
can crystallize

876
00:45:06,534 --> 00:45:08,434
Exactly what they're hoping
to get out of this.

877
00:45:08,501 --> 00:45:09,467
Well, bully for me.

878
00:45:09,534 --> 00:45:11,700
So now all we have to do

879
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:16,100
Is figure out how to get you
from here to happy.

after a couple of years.

1061
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:21,401
I just...

1062
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,467
Couldn't stop.

1063
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:26,967
I miss her.

1064
00:54:35,634 --> 00:54:36,668
I should go.

1065
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:41,467
Good night.

1066
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:54,867
Good night.

1067
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,700
So what happened?

1068
00:55:17,767 --> 00:55:20,434
You're talking
to me now.
No.

1069
00:55:27,267 --> 00:55:28,800
Was it fun?

1071
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,334
She kissed me.

1072
00:55:40,401 --> 00:55:42,700
Don't read
into the phrasing.

1073
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:44,900
We kissed each other.

1074
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,234
And how do you feel
about that?

1075
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,234
How do I feel about that?
It was a kiss.

1076
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:50,134
Kisses are good things.

1077
00:55:50,201 --> 00:55:51,668
Okay.

1078
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:55,634
That was
a loaded "okay."

1079
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,800
Not at all.
Why would you assume that?

1080
00:55:57,867 --> 00:56:00,167
'Cause you're being
judgmental.

1081
00:56:00,234 --> 00:56:02,434
If I had said that I'd had
some delicious chilean sea bass

1082
00:56:02,501 --> 00:56:03,733
For dinner last night,

1083
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,434
Would you say, "and how
do you feel about that?"

1084
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:07,234
If the sea bass
was married, I might.

1085
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:10,634
See, you're being judgmental.

1086
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,201
Isn't that against your code
or something?

1087
00:56:13,267 --> 00:56:14,534
I'm simply stating
the obvious.

1088
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:15,934
It's complicated,

1089
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,301
not just because
she's married

1090
00:56:17,367 --> 00:56:19,833
and not just because
you're institutionalized.

1091
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,301
I know you spent
the last 12 hours

1092
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:24,501
trying to figure out
what that kiss means.

1093
00:56:24,568 --> 00:56:29,334
Who's that woman you 
were with in the parking lot?

1094
00:56:29,401 --> 00:56:31,201
When you deflect,

1095
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:33,634
it's more effective when
you're not that transparent.

1096
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,267
Obviously you have no problem
with the infidelity.

1097
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:38,201
You're trying
to rationalize that,

1098
00:56:38,267 --> 00:56:40,367
"If it's okay for your doctor,
it's okay."

1099
00:56:40,434 --> 00:56:42,034
But just
for the record,

1100
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,234
I am not having
an affair.
Then who is she?

1101
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:45,733
Why do you think
you're working so hard

1102
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,167
To figure out the details
of my personal life?

1103
00:56:47,234 --> 00:56:48,501
I might not have
to work so hard

1104
00:56:48,568 --> 00:56:50,067
If there were
some personal items in here.

1105
00:56:50,134 --> 00:56:52,067
You got one number
on speed dial.

1106
00:56:52,134 --> 00:56:53,668
It says "dad."

1107
00:56:53,733 --> 00:56:55,501
Come on,
how old are you?

1108
00:56:55,568 --> 00:56:57,134
Why are you so afraid
to talk about this?

1109
00:56:57,201 --> 00:56:58,334
I want to talk about you.

1110
00:56:58,401 --> 00:57:00,067
I want to know
who I'm taking advice from.

1111
00:57:00,134 --> 00:57:02,134
I'm not giving you advice.
I'm asking you questions.

1112
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:03,800
I think that kiss
meant a lot.

1113
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:05,000
I think that scares you.

1114
00:57:05,067 --> 00:57:07,267
I think there are
no personal items in here

1115
00:57:07,334 --> 00:57:09,067
Because you have
no personal life.

1116
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,167
How do you think
you and Lydia will end?

1117
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:12,634
You are a lonely man.

1118
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,234
You've screwed up every
opportunity you've had in life.

1119
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:16,800
What's the ending
to the story?

1120
00:57:21,967 --> 00:57:23,833
I don't know.

1121
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,668
Visiting time!

1122
00:57:49,034 --> 00:57:50,467
Why did you kiss me?

1123
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:57,301
How many reasons are there?

1124
00:57:57,367 --> 00:58:00,134
I like you.

1125
00:58:00,201 --> 00:58:03,167
It felt like a nice way
of showing you that.

1126
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,000
<i>[Playing schumann's
kinderszenen op. 15 ]</i>

1127
00:58:26,434 --> 00:58:28,267
<i>Open it all the way.
Keep it open.</i>

1128
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:53,700
How'd it go with Lydia?

1129
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:56,833
I found out
you can only be happy so long

1130
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,267
Before the catatonic guy
with two broken limbs

1131
00:58:59,334 --> 00:59:01,100
Rolls off the elevator,

1132
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:03,234
Philosophically speaking.

1133
00:59:03,301 --> 00:59:06,167
Why do you value your failures
more than your successes?

1134
00:59:06,234 --> 00:59:09,000
My mother
caught me masturbating...

1135
00:59:09,067 --> 00:59:10,301
To pictures
of her mother.

1136
00:59:10,367 --> 00:59:12,201
Can we get past
these cute deflections?

1137
00:59:14,067 --> 00:59:16,434
Successes only last
until someone screws them up.

1138
00:59:16,501 --> 00:59:18,267
Failures are forever.

1139
00:59:18,334 --> 00:59:20,534
<i>So you accept
that fact.</i>

1140
00:59:20,601 --> 00:59:22,668
You accept that
there's nothing you can do.

1141
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:26,134
Okay, I accept the fact
that there's nothing I can do.

1142
00:59:26,201 --> 00:59:28,034
Now, what can I do?

1143
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,833
You acknowledge failure,

1144
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,301
And you move past it.

1145
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:34,301
You apologize.

1146
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:36,201
Wow.

1147
00:59:36,267 --> 00:59:39,367
Powerful things
these apologies.

1148
00:59:39,434 --> 00:59:41,700
Get someone to jump
off a building.

1149
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:44,000
You say two words,
and you move on with your life.

1150
00:59:44,067 --> 00:59:46,501
Hardly seems fair.

1151
00:59:46,568 --> 00:59:47,934
Is that the issue?

1152
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:53,401
You caused him pain.

1153
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:59,367
If the world is just,
you have to suffer equally?

1154
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:05,534
You're not god, House.

1155
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:08,301
You're just another
screwed-Up human being

1156
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:09,934
Who needs to move on.

1157
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:13,900
Apologize to him.

1158
01:00:13,967 --> 01:00:16,334
Let yourself
feel better.

1159
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:19,467
Then you can learn
to let yourself...

1160
01:00:19,534 --> 01:00:22,733
Keep feeling better.

1161
01:00:47,034 --> 01:00:49,800
Hey.

1162
01:01:02,434 --> 01:01:04,867
Dr. House, everything okay?

1163
01:01:07,034 --> 01:01:08,733
Yeah.

1164
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,934
Time for group.

1165
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,867
Group time, everybody!

1166
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:18,000
I have a surprise.

1167
01:01:18,067 --> 01:01:19,401
Two weeks from today,

1168
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:22,733
we're going to have
the Mayfield talent show.

1169
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,234
Talent show?
Who's in it?

1170
01:01:25,301 --> 01:01:27,833
I'd really love it if everybody
here could participate.

1171
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,334
<i>Then who's gonna watch?</i>

1172
01:01:29,401 --> 01:01:31,267
<i>The staff will come,</i>

1173
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:32,568
friends and family.

1174
01:01:32,634 --> 01:01:34,167
You gonna tape this?

1175
01:01:34,234 --> 01:01:35,733
No, it's just for us.

1176
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,067
Well, if it's just for us,
I vote we don't do it.

1177
01:01:38,134 --> 01:01:43,234
Think of it as a fun way to work
on--On our therapeutic issues.

1178
01:01:43,301 --> 01:01:45,601
Alvie, maybe you could sing
one of your songs.

1179
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,934
I don't sing. I rap.

1180
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,900
Okay, well, you can write
something just for us.

1181
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:53,301
I don't write.
I just do, freestyle style.

1182
01:01:53,367 --> 01:01:56,234
I think you're gonna
want to be prepared.

1183
01:01:56,301 --> 01:01:58,201
<i>Make something
special.
Always special.</i>

1184
01:01:58,267 --> 01:01:59,467
<i>How about you, Diane?</i>

1185
01:01:59,534 --> 01:02:00,900
Is there something
you'd like to do?

1186
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,668
I don't have
any talents.

1187
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:05,134
Sure you do.

1188
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:06,800
You all do.

1189
01:02:06,867 --> 01:02:09,634
Steve, don't you think
that Diane has hidden talent

1190
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:11,267
That we'd all like
to see come out?

1191
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,634
You really think
he's gonna answer?

1192
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,867
Eventually.

1193
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:19,134
Why?

1194
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:20,700
Because things pass.

1195
01:02:20,767 --> 01:02:21,833
Things change.

1196
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,833
It doesn't mean
they get better.

1197
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,167
You got to make
things better.

1198
01:02:25,234 --> 01:02:27,568
You can't just keep talking
and hope for the best.

1199
01:02:31,267 --> 01:02:32,534
Diane, maybe you and I
can work together

1200
01:02:32,601 --> 01:02:33,700
And figure something out.

1201
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,668
I can save him.

1202
01:02:38,733 --> 01:02:41,000
"They stole her voice box"--
That's what he said.

1203
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:43,000
<i>That's what
she was staring at.</i>

1204
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:44,833
That's why he's staring.

1205
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:45,967
Dr. House, please.

1206
01:02:46,034 --> 01:02:47,900
'Cause there's
a music box in there.

1207
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:49,568
Orderly.

1208
01:02:51,034 --> 01:02:53,100
Come on, just give it to me.
I can--

1209
01:02:53,167 --> 01:02:56,700
I am not having
a psychotic break.

1210
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,401
I promise you
this will work.

1211
01:03:07,301 --> 01:03:08,467
<i>It's the blue box there</i>

1212
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,601
On the top shelf.

1213
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,867
This is what you wanted.

1214
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:18,234
This is what you needed--
A voice.

1215
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:20,367
You thought you could cure
silent girl with this.

1216
01:03:20,434 --> 01:03:22,767
So by your own rationale,
it should cure you.

1217
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:27,334
There's nothing wrong
with you.

1218
01:03:27,401 --> 01:03:29,601
You're healing.
All the parts work.

1219
01:03:29,668 --> 01:03:30,634
Just speak.

1220
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,267
Come on, speak!
Say something!

1221
01:03:34,334 --> 01:03:36,634
I think maybe everyone
should take a break now.

1222
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:50,167
You're trying to fix
instead of moving on.

1223
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:08,667
I brought dvorak--

1224
01:04:08,734 --> 01:04:10,767
Four hands.

1225
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:15,101
What?

1226
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:18,734
I need to know
what this is.

1227
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,800
It's sheet music.

1228
01:04:25,034 --> 01:04:27,567
I told you.
It's just...

1229
01:04:27,634 --> 01:04:30,268
Two people having fun.

1230
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:32,767
There's two
possible outcomes.

1231
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:34,433
It ends.
Someone gets hurt.

1232
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,567
Or it doesn't end.
Someone gets hurt.

1233
01:04:37,634 --> 01:04:39,301
So the end sucks.

1234
01:04:39,368 --> 01:04:42,834
It doesn't mean
the beginning has to.

1235
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:45,433
Everything ends.
Life ends.

1236
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,134
It--It doesn't mean
that we can't enjoy it.

1237
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:53,134
I can't--
I can't do this.

1238
01:04:53,201 --> 01:04:56,201
All I know is,
I was happy five minutes ago,

1239
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:58,368
And now I'm not.

1240
01:04:58,433 --> 01:05:01,667
How's that better?

1241
01:05:01,734 --> 01:05:04,101
Good-Bye, Lydia.

1242
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:13,667
I'm really worried
about E.C.T.

1243
01:05:13,734 --> 01:05:15,400
<i>Apprehension's normal.</i>

1244
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:17,134
Has anyone else had it?

1245
01:05:17,201 --> 01:05:18,301
They shocked me, man.

1246
01:05:18,368 --> 01:05:20,101
Aagh!

1247
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,634
Thanks.
That's very reassuring.

1248
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,700
I don't know
if I should do it.

1249
01:05:24,767 --> 01:05:27,067
Oh, just do the treatment
or shut up.

1250
01:05:27,134 --> 01:05:28,634
Greg, there's
a process.

1251
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,334
Yes, a process.

1252
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,600
Wouldn't want to disrupt
the process with results.

1253
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:34,268
Heezy had a rough night
last night.

1254
01:05:34,334 --> 01:05:36,001
Guess he decided to go
back to being an ass

1255
01:05:36,067 --> 01:05:37,167
Instead of a hypocrite.

1256
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:39,234
<i>let's move on.</i>

1257
01:05:39,301 --> 01:05:42,234
Alvie, are you making
any progress writing your rap?

1258
01:05:42,301 --> 01:05:43,101
<i>yeah.</i>

1259
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,800
But really, no.

1260
01:05:44,867 --> 01:05:46,600
I just don't want to write
my songs down.

1261
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:48,334
It takes all
the spontaneity out of it.

1262
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,934
It's not
of the moment.

1263
01:05:51,001 --> 01:05:52,400
Alvie, if you write
things down--

1264
01:05:52,467 --> 01:05:54,433
* when the time comes,
my rhyme comes *

1265
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,700
* when my spotlight shines *

1266
01:05:57,767 --> 01:05:59,867
Yeah, you're a genius.

1267
01:05:59,934 --> 01:06:01,767
Rhymes with "penius."

1268
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:04,134
Sorry to interrupt,
dr. Beasley.

1269
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:06,234
Dr. Nolan asked me
to give you this.

1270
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,368
Is this
a day pass?

1271
01:06:12,433 --> 01:06:14,268
He'd like to see you.

1272
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,667
Thanks for coming.

1273
01:06:35,734 --> 01:06:38,500
I was hoping you could, uh,
take a look at my dad's chart.

1274
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:40,734
A consult?

1275
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:45,201
What happened--You went through
every sane doctor in town?

1276
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:47,301
I thought you wouldn't mind
getting off the ward.

1277
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,867
Cleaning lady found him
on the kitchen floor.

1278
01:06:53,934 --> 01:06:56,700
Doctors here don't think
that he'll recover,

1279
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:58,467
That I should pull
the plug.

1280
01:06:58,533 --> 01:07:00,901
I want a second opinion,
so I--

1281
01:07:00,967 --> 01:07:02,467
I thought I'd be a fool
not to call you.

1282
01:07:05,934 --> 01:07:08,001
<i>Lacunar infarct,</i>

1283
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:11,034
Converted
to hemorrhagic stroke.

1284
01:07:11,101 --> 01:07:13,634
It squashed his brain.

1285
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,934
They didn't miss
anything.

1286
01:07:15,001 --> 01:07:17,634
That's what I thought.

1287
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,101
That's what you knew.

1288
01:07:20,867 --> 01:07:23,533
His brain
has been replaced by blood.

1289
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,800
It's over.

1290
01:07:24,867 --> 01:07:27,001
And that's obvious
to any doctor

1291
01:07:27,067 --> 01:07:28,700
Who looks at that scan,
even a shrink.

1292
01:07:28,767 --> 01:07:30,368
<i>You want someone
to tell you</i>

1293
01:07:30,433 --> 01:07:32,101
<i>That what you need to do
is okay,</i>

1294
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:33,734
To give you permission,
absolution.

1295
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,268
Not now, House.

1296
01:07:36,334 --> 01:07:39,767
You have no friends,
no family.

1297
01:07:39,834 --> 01:07:42,101
<i>At some point,</i>

1298
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:43,400
You made a mistake.

1299
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:46,500
You lost everything.

1300
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:48,834
And now I'm the closest thing
you got to a friend.

1301
01:07:48,901 --> 01:07:50,867
Just shut up.

1302
01:07:52,867 --> 01:07:55,001
I don't need you here

1303
01:07:55,067 --> 01:07:57,400
To play this game.

1304
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,634
I'm sorry
I pushed you away.

1305
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,467
It's what I do
when I'm afraid.

1306
01:08:55,767 --> 01:08:58,634
Again, german-english
translation may be a little off.

1307
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:05,067
I'm not--I'm not crying
because of you.

1308
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,567
I'm crying
because I'm pathetic.

1309
01:09:10,634 --> 01:09:11,934

Oh, well, then I take
the apology back.

1407
01:20:24,234 --> 01:20:27,101
You don't just get to slide
right back into society.

1408
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:32,334
She's going
to a rehab facility first...

1409
01:20:32,401 --> 01:20:33,267
In Arizona.

1410
01:20:35,368 --> 01:20:38,201
Her family's
moving there.

1411
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,134
Sorry, House.

1412
01:20:42,201 --> 01:20:44,401
I just found out myself.

1413
01:20:49,734 --> 01:20:51,734
I want
an overnight pass.

1414
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:58,401
I can help you
with this.

1415
01:20:58,468 --> 01:21:00,468
I've earned it.
You have, but--

1416
01:21:00,533 --> 01:21:01,800
Isn't extending trust

1417
01:21:01,867 --> 01:21:03,500
Part of the whole
"getting me better" thing?

1418
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,434
If you insist on a pass,
I'll give it to you.

1419
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,667
But I know
where you're going,

1420
01:21:06,734 --> 01:21:10,101
And I know you
haven't thought it through.

1421
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:12,500
We need to sit down,
talk about this.

1422
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:17,600
Please give me
the pass.

1423
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:45,134
Hi.

1424
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:46,334
<i>Hello.</i>

1425
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:47,468
Who are you?

1426
01:21:47,533 --> 01:21:48,368
I'm--

1427
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,067
Ben, go inside,
okay?

1428
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:01,967
You didn't say
anything.

1429
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:03,000
And now
annie's leaving,

1430
01:22:03,067 --> 01:22:05,601
And I hear
you're going to arizona.

1431
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:09,767
My husband travels
to phoenix a lot.

1432
01:22:09,834 --> 01:22:11,501
His corporate headquarters
are there,

1433
01:22:11,567 --> 01:22:13,934
And we've been wanting
to move for years,

1434
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,801
But we've been
tethered here.

1435
01:22:15,868 --> 01:22:19,234
And now we're not.

1436
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,767
I don't want you to go.

1437
01:22:23,868 --> 01:22:25,968
I don't want to go.

1438
01:22:28,367 --> 01:22:31,100
But I can't break up
my family.

1439
01:22:31,167 --> 01:22:33,868
I-I can't leave
my children.

1440
01:22:33,934 --> 01:22:37,167
I just don't want it
to change.

1441
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:46,300
I'm sorry that I didn't come
to say good bye.

1442
01:22:46,301 --> 01:22:49,601
I thought it ended
kind of perfect.

1443
01:22:57,667 --> 01:22:59,800
I have to go.

1444
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:19,867
Not the most exciting use

1445
01:23:19,934 --> 01:23:21,600
Of the overnight pass
I've ever seen.

1446
01:23:21,667 --> 01:23:25,134
She left.

1447
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:27,800
And...

1448
01:23:27,867 --> 01:23:29,867
I'm lost.

1449
01:23:42,433 --> 01:23:45,268
I'm gonna write
your letter...

1450
01:23:45,334 --> 01:23:46,967
To the medical board,

1451
01:23:47,034 --> 01:23:48,934
Recommending that they give
your license back.

1452
01:23:49,001 --> 01:23:51,301
You can't just console me

1453
01:23:51,368 --> 01:23:54,001
By giving me a lollipop
when I skin my knee.

1454
01:23:54,067 --> 01:23:55,400
Well, two things
just happened.

1455
01:23:55,467 --> 01:23:56,734
You got hurt,

1456
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,667
Which means you connected
to someone else,

1457
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:00,167
Strongly enough
to miss them.

1458
01:24:00,234 --> 01:24:02,134
And more important...

1459
01:24:02,201 --> 01:24:04,600
You recognized the pain
and came to talk to me,

1460
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:08,700
Instead of hiding from it
in the vicodin bottle.

1461
01:24:08,767 --> 01:24:11,533
The fact that you're hurting
and you came here,

1462
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,368
The fact that
you're taking your meds

1463
01:24:13,433 --> 01:24:15,934
And we're talking
right now...

1464
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,634
Come inside
and get some sleep.

1465
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,600
Tomorrow you can start saying
your good-Byes.

1466
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,268
Today we're here
to congratulate greg.

1467
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,001
[Applause]

1468
01:24:35,067 --> 01:24:36,067
We're proud of him.

1469
01:24:36,134 --> 01:24:38,667
We wish him well,
and we hope...

1470
01:24:38,734 --> 01:24:40,834
<i>(All)
to never see him again!</i>

1471
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:42,334
House!

[Cheers and applause]

1474

Back off.

1475
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,800
People already think
we're gay.
