He's dead.

found him on the floor
in the laundry room.

he wasn't breathing.

Yes, the fact that
he's not dead

House is having issues.

518
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,422
I missed you
a lot today.

519
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,430
All I wanna do is...

520
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,667
(WILSON SIGHING)

521
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,001
You know.

522
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,871
No cancers on the
lateral cuneiform bone.

523
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,677
Navicular's also clean.

524
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,148
Chase is lying to me.

525
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,985
And I know you know.
Tell me what's
going on, please.

526
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,024
I'm going to tell you
the same thing I told him.

527
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,253
Talk to your spouse.

528
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,635
No breakfast?

529
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,603
Not today.

530
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,966
I'm hallucinating.

531
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,399
What happened?

532
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,469
It's nothing visual
this time.

533
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,142
I hear whispering.

534
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,207
Is that why you've
been acting so weird?
Is that why you quit?

535
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,776
I'm losing it.

536
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,117
I'm sure there's
a rational explanation,

537
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,885
the wind,
a neighbor's TV...

538
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,084
I checked everything.

539
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,255
What's really scary is
that I hear whispering
while not on Vicodin.

540
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,933
I'm gonna check myself
back in to Mayfield.

541
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,162
Okay.

542
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,567
Okay?

543
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,304
You don't think
there might be
a logical explanation?

544
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,438
Something I missed?

545
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,846
You're the smartest
guy I know.

546
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,612
If you haven't
thought of it,
it doesn't exist.

547
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,213
I'll drive you over.
I just need to
make some tea first.

548
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,024
You know.

549
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,455
That you're an ass? Yeah.

550
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,557
You overheard me talking
to my dead girlfriend
and thought to yourself,

551
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,932
"Hmm. What kind of fun
can I have with this?"

552
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,163
Why are you
talking to her?

553
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,500
Did you run out
of living people?

554
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,631
You can talk to me,
I'm right here.

555
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,108
I miss her.
Talking to her
makes me feel better.

556
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,474
You don't.

557
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,314
Patient,
Lauren Maybaum, 27,

558
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,182
presented two days ago
with severe abdominal pain.

559
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,852
Sorry I'm late.

560
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,048
Yesterday, you said
you weren't ready.

561
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,114
Yesterday, I wasn't.
Today, I am.

562
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,320
And tomorrow?
Is it possible for me to
get a five-day forecast?

563
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,260
Feeling much better,
thank you for not asking.

564
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,766
Either you did
have a problem,
which I can't ignore,

565
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,530
or you were
jerking me around,
which I can't ignore.

566
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,468
You are a woman,
you can do anything.

567
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,598
For example, I can talk
to you outside.

568
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,377
You sure you're
only one woman?

569
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,544
This is the part where
you play the employee
and I play the boss.

570
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,315
I can see your nipples.
Your turn.

571
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,651
These kids are...

572
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,554
No wonder
she hates him.

573
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,150
Mmm. That's not hate.
It's foreplay.

574
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,388
It's inappropriate.

575
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,921
(WHISTLING)

576
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,998
Gamma survey
revealed no tumors.

577
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,298
So it's not bone cancer.

578
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,530
Where's Chase?

579
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,697
Don't know.

580
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,164
Hmm.

581
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,404
Two mysteries, cool.
Theories?

582
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:33,042
Did I come in too soon?
Okay. I'm going to
take another lap,

583
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,517
and I want three new ideas
by the time I come back.

584
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,781
One of them's got
to be not stupid.

585
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:45,318
Where there's pain,
there's nerves.

586
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,423
Hereditary Sensory
Autonomic Neuropathy,
type 1.

587
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,263
Miscommunication
in the brain stem

588
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,928
mistakes nerve pain
for tooth pain.

589
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,266
That explains
the bradycardia, too.

590
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,102
And I like the word
"hereditary" in the title.

591
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,732
Carbamazepine fixes him.

592
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,709
I'll get him started
on the medication.
HOUSE: No.

593
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,575
Chase specifically
asked if he could do it.

594
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,811
(THUDDING)

595
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,343
Sleep at home.

596
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,916
So I didn't do
the gamma survey.

597
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,185
Was it bone cancer?

598
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,282
No.

599
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,351
Then you should
congratulate me for
not wasting your time.

600
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,089
Are you getting
some help,

601
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,723
or is this the way
things are gonna be
from now on?

602
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,426
What's pathetic is

603
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,096
you haven't gotten help
because you want
to feel bad.

604
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,366
You want to suffer.

605
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,603
Because if you feel guilty,
then you're not a psychopath.

606
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,440
Patient needs
some carbamazepine.

607
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,675
Now I don't care
how much that room
scares you,

608
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,046
you're doing your job.

609
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,351
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

610
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,160
How long before you cross
this one off the list?

611
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,661
Couple of hours.

612
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,305
You ever shoot anyone?

613
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,703
Twice.

614
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,543
You ever kill anyone?

615
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,412
No. But I know
a few guys who did,
though.

616
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,419
Did they ever
get over it?

617
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,081
A captain I know compares it
to taking out the trash.

618
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,920
Like it's nothing.

619
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,984
Other hand,
I got an ex-partner

620
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,256
who nearly drank
himself into oblivion.

621
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,422
Did he get help?

622
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,656
Yeah.

623
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,261
Help didn't help.

624
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,436
Oh, God!

625
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,002
What is it?

626
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,737
I went to the bathroom.

627
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,484
Patient's lost
bowel control.

628
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,318
Means we were
wrong about HSAN

629
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,914
and means he's
getting worse, fast.

630
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,926
Wouldn't want to
be the duty nurse
assigned to his floor.

631
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,224
Get it? "Doody" nurse?

632
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,423
Fine, do the doctor thing.

633
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,898
CHASE: An autoimmune
disorder could explain...

634
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,367
We put him on steroids,
he didn't respond.
It's not autoimmune.

635
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,630
Could be Wilson's Disease.

636
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,501
Disease that advanced
would've hit the liver.

637
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:12,669
It is possible
the liver is so far gone,
the labs look normal.

638
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,904
It's worth a shot.

639
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,606
Go treat
with penicillamine.

640
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,676
And when he
doesn't get better,
come back quickly,

641
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,184
so we can get one
more shot at it.

642
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,383
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

643
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,827
(EXHALES)

644
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,761
FATHER PRANGE:
Take your time.

645
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,031
How long has it been
since your last confession?

646
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,629
I killed a man.

647
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,066
Oh.

648
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,976
But it was
the right thing to do.

649
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,476
Who lives or dies
is not your decision
to make.

650
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,782
Sometimes in
the operating room,
it feels like it.

651
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,721
I'm a doctor.

652
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,219
Well, then you
should know more
than anybody

653
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,318
that every
human life is sacred.

654
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,163
Why?

655
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,665
Tell me what's sacred
about a dictator

656
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,726
that kills
hundreds of thousands
of his own people.

657
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:16,034
What is sacred
about a doctor
who kills a patient?

658
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,738
(SCOFFS)

659
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,279
Is it just
the slippery slope
you're worried about?

660
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,679
Afraid that forgiving me
for killing

661
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,378
the worst person on earth
sets a bad precedent?

662
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,487
I promise,
I won't tell anyone.

663
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,524
Just forgive me.

664
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,094
Saying 10 Hail Marys
isn't going to
do you any good.

665
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,763
Then what do I have to do?

666
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,475
What does God
need me to do?

667
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,170
You can't
have absolution

668
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,406
without first
taking responsibility.

669
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,480
You have to turn yourself
in to the police.

670
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,350
What, and...
And go to jail for
the rest of my life?

671
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,355
What's just about that?

672
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,086
I did the right thing.

673
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,860
There has to
be another way.

674
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,956
You want absolution,
I told you how to get it.

675
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,086
Send this in to
the State Licensing Board.

676
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,524
I've signed off
on all your hours.

677
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,352
Why?

678
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,260
Because it's easier
this way.

679
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,026
You're uncomfortable
with me.

680
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,459
No.

681
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,833
Going by the book
was pointless.

682
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:53,927
You were gonna
learn nothing.

683
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,337
Good.
I thought it was because
of the sexual tension.

684
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,499
There was
no sexual tension.

685
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:58,599
There was tension.

686
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,702
And it made me
feel funny, so...

687
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,040
Here.

688
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,052
It's too bad.

689
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,250
I was kind of
getting into the whole
"hot for teacher" thing.

690
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,355
You sure you're okay?

691
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,722
Yeah. False alarm.

692
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,132
What about us?

693
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,398
We're good.
Just like this.

694
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,800
You press my buttons,
I press yours.

695
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,862
By "buttons,"
you mean...

696
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,038
Huh.

697
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,113
You do make me
feel funny.

698
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,927
You're not gonna die.

699
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,527
I've accepted it.
It's okay.

700
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,696
In addition to
high arches

701
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,297
and some crystal bowl
in the shape of a tuna,

702
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:08,004
you also inherited
a self-destruct button.

703
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,037
Forms in the brain stem.

704
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,379
Technically,
it's an aneurysm,
presses on nerves

705
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,477
<i>that control everything</i>
<i>from tooth pain</i>
<i>to heart rate.</i>

706
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,385
<i>As you get older,</i>
<i>it gets bigger,</i>

707
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:23,052
until finally the button,
which I'll call
"intracranial berry aneurysm,"

708
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:26,585
because I had a friend in
high school with that name,
stops the signal

709
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,462
<i>from your brain to</i>
<i>your heart and bam!</i>

710
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,731
How do I know you're
not still lying to me?

711
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,498
Saying I'm healthy
just to make me
feel better?

712
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,631
It does sound
that way, doesn't it?

713
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,675
But this time,
no sugar pills.

714
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,108
I'm going to cut
into your brain

715
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,838
to make you think
that I'm fixing it.

716
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,403
And if our fake tests
confirm it,

717
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,279
I'm going to be cutting
into your son's brain, too.

718
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,875
Because I'm just
that committed.

719
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,080
Michael is going to
be okay?

720
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,420
Unless he walks out of here
and gets run over by a bus,

721
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,791
in which case,
I will reconsider
your fate argument.

722
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:03,429
You wanna give him a call?
Visiting hours don't
apply to my patients.

723
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,293
Yeah. In a bit.

724
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,504
Yeah, that's what I thought.

725
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,768
The "saving the kid
from pain" stuff was crap.

726
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,779
You just don't want
anything in your life
that won't let you do

727
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:17,973
whatever the hell
you want to do

728
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,073
whenever the hell
you want to do it.

729
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,450
You've had it easy.
Sorry to screw you up.

730
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,336
Mom.

731
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,288
Maybe when
we get out of here...

732
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,291
What kind of movies
you like?

733
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:22,310
He's been missing
for eight hours.
Robert Chase. C-H-A-S...

734
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,841
Hey!

735
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,676
Never mind.
He just walked in. Sorry.

736
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,741
You could've called me.

737
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,121
I forgot.
To call me?

738
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,919
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Where were you?

739
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,323
You're drunk.

740
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:37,553
All right, I...

741
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,697
I needed to get wasted.
I did.

742
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,097
And now I'm better.

743
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,336
What aren't
you telling me?

744
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,631
Nothing.

745
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,841
(VOICE WHISPERING)

746
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,650
(WHISPERING STOPS)

747
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,550
Hi, Dad.

748
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,290
I think I've been

749
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,351
focusing on
the wrong thing.

750
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,061
There were
some good times.

751
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,370
Wilson, this is stupid!

752
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,610
You see?

753
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,676
He really is
getting better.
