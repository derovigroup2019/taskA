1
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,021
Left! Left! He's going left!

2
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:14,613
I'm gonna have a heart attack.

3
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,709
Nowhere to go, buddy.

4
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,749
What the hell was that?
What are we chasing?

5
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:00,811
Go that way.

6
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,154
Up, donny, up.
He's going for the roof.

7
00:01:30,284 --> 00:01:31,657
He's going up, go.

8
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,183
Ow. Damn it.

9
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:38,736
Just go, go!

10
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,433
Donny, no! It's too far!

11
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:06,258
I can rest at home.

12
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:08,608
We can't release you
for at least two days.

13
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:10,999
You have two broken bones,
a severe concussion,

14
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:12,267
collapsed lung.

15
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:14,889
But you didn't find anything
life-threatening, right?

16
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:16,893
You fell 30 feet. You should have died.

17
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,534
- That was the point.
- Could you shut up?

18
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,396
You have suicidal thoughts?

19
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:21,791
Not once. Never.

20
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:23,123
He doesn't want to kill himself.

21
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:24,447
He just thinks he's gonna die soon,

22
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,274
so it doesn't really matter...
Now you shut up.

23
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:27,732
I'm the one you're not covering

24
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:29,150
when you pull your crazy stunts.

25
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,933
Why do you think you're gonna die soon?

26
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:33,990
Well, my dad, grandfather,
and great-grandfather

27
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:35,203
all dropped dead of heart problems

28
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,513
right after they turned 40.

29
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:37,962
Look who turns 40 next week.

30
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:40,492
- I can refer you to a cardiologist, if you...
- Nah, I've been there,

31
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,476
all of them.

32
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:43,739
I spent my early 30s going
from one doctor to another.

33
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,534
Every single one says my heart's fine.

34
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:47,504
- And you think they're wrong?
- I know they're wrong.

35
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:49,105
But what can I do?

36
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:50,994
At a certain point,
you just got to live your life.

37
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,029
By live your life,

38
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:52,989
you mean risk your life.

39
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:54,611
If there is something wrong,

40
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,430
I know a doctor who will find it.

41
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:05,232
Oh, God! I'll be back in ten.

42
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:07,871
I'm picking lint out of my belly button.

43
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:08,847
This is ridiculous.

44
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:10,978
I'm converting the study into a bedroom.

45
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:11,934
Huh...

46
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:13,603
Six weeks.

47
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,250
Longer than I thought it would take...

48
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:17,834
for you to notice that I'm
sleeping in your living room,

49
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:19,333
and offer other options.

50
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:21,258
I didn't expect
you to be here this long.

51
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,684
True, but that's not why

52
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,130
you didn't extend the invitation.

53
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,002
Do you really need to deconstruct this?

54
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:28,097
You didn't want me to sleep
where you and Amber slept.

55
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,915
- Okay, yes, you do.
- After she died,

56
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:31,513
you converted the study to a bedroom

57
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:32,652
and the bedroom to a study...

58
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:34,795
Except it's not a study, it's a shrine.

59
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:37,983
Can I tell you something?

60
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,786
I wasn't picking lint
out of my belly button.

61
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:41,725
Okay.

62
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,495
I am not ready to transition

63
00:04:43,556 --> 00:04:45,111
from my dead girlfriend's shrine

64
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,492
to your... morning glory.

65
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:48,567
I'll have a mattress delivered

66
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:50,051
and set up for you in the tabernacle.

67
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,577
I just need it tuesdays
for animal sacrifices.

68
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:55,716
Oh, man!

69
00:04:57,153 --> 00:04:57,987
Ugh.

70
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,203
Patient's a genetic time bomb.

71
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:02,597
There's no fuse.

72
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:03,727
He's not a bomb.

73
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:05,115
Right now he's not a patient either.

74
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,072
You saying we ignore three
generations of cardiac problems?

75
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,078
I'm not ignoring it.

76
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:10,487
I'm labeling it a coincidence.

77
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,710
You hate coincidence.

78
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,252
We reconciled. It was a whole thing.

79
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,180
Big country.

80
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,783
It's statistically probable that someone

81
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,925
has three generations
that died around age 40

82
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:21,680
with nongenetic heart issues.

83
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:23,556
- Dice have no memory.
- Genes do.

84
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:26,504
If we ran a battery of tests
on every nonsymptomatic

85
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:27,815
statistical anomaly...

86
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:30,094
The guy goes every day assuming
his life will end at age 40.

87
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:31,474
Never got married, no kids,

88
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:32,753
because he didn't want to die on them

89
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:34,318
the same way his dad died on him.

90
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:35,909
You want to take this case
'cause he's yet another

91
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:37,362
lonely, sad puppy.

92
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:39,072
You should have been a vet.

93
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:40,170
It's a legitimate case.

94
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,951
Differential diagnosis

95
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:43,470
for genetic heart conditions.

96
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:45,493
That sold you?

97
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,537
- Marfan syndrome, brugada.
- And you?

98
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:49,071
Emilio hypercholesterolemia.

99
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:50,233
He's only agreeing with you

100
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:51,482
'cause he wants to have sex with you.

101
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:53,083
And by the way, I agree with you too,

102
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:54,414
especially in those pants.

103
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:56,623
We're not wasting our time.

104
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:58,002
And last week, Chase said

105
00:05:58,095 --> 00:05:59,419
that I was the de facto boss.

106
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,466
Hospitals don't recognize

107
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:01,837
de facto medical licenses.

108
00:06:01,956 --> 00:06:03,365
Let's start with genetic tests.

109
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,812
Get an EKG, cardiac cath...

110
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:06,794
and an echo to check
the integrity of his heart.

111
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:09,960
I'll start on blood samples.

112
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:25,059
Ugh...

113
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:27,993
- Forgot my watch.
- Could have sworn

114
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:29,865
- I saw you put it on this morning.
- Must be in the locker room.

115
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:30,880
I'll be right back.

116
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,155
I need to know what your plans are.

117
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:40,170
First we take Berlin.

118
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:41,879
And then we circle around behind Poland

119
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,136
and yell, "surprise!"

120
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:44,716
With regards to your employment.

121
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:46,806
I like things the way they are.

122
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:49,285
I get just enough puzzle to solve

123
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,095
without the scornful visits from you...

124
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,488
Until now.

125
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:54,103
Pretend time's been going on
long enough.

126
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,632
I don't have a medical license.
All I can do is pretend.

127
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:58,125
And I'm gonna have payroll send you over

128
00:06:58,203 --> 00:06:59,783
some pretend checks starting tomorrow.

129
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:03,095
You need to complete 120 hours
of rounds to re-qualify.

130
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:06,820
No, I don't.

131
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:08,842
I'm not saying you don't win.

132
00:07:08,943 --> 00:07:10,398
I'm just saying do you really need

133
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:12,500
to punish me by making me carry a clipboard

134
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:13,910
for your lackey of the week?

135
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:15,075
It's a state requirement.

136
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:17,130
I have to certify that you've
completed all your require...

137
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:18,259
Exactly.

138
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,986
The requirement sets out
what you have to do...

139
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:21,417
Certify, which you can do

140
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:22,822
with one hand tied behind your back.

141
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:24,490
Now, if you want to tie my hands...

142
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:27,405
Dr. Singh supervises rounds on thursdays,

143
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:28,710
starts at 7:00.

144
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,733
Nothing.

145
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:38,578
So what now?

146
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:39,762
Send him home.

147
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,654
To continue believing
he's gonna drop dead?

148
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,481
When he turns 70, he'll believe us.

149
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:45,093
There are other things we can check.

150
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:48,148
Skeleton of great-grandfather's
in decent shape.

151
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:50,820
Subsurface genetic material
from grandpa's fine,

152
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:52,971
leaving one bowl of purified dad.

153
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:53,999
You do the dad.

154
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:55,995
I take it he had a sealed casket.

155
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:58,589
The watch story was crap, right?

156
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:01,217
I forgot it.

157
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:02,903
It's no big deal.

158
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:04,399
You were avoiding the ICU

159
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,431
where Dibala died.

160
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:09,778
I'll sequence the gene
for the cardiac sodium channel.

161
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:12,987
I felt like I was gonna have
a panic attack.

162
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:17,758
I've crossed some line...

163
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:21,480
And I'm having trouble
getting back to the other side.

164
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:25,421
I can move the patient to another room.

165
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:27,495
Cameron will ask questions.

166
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:29,031
You should tell her.

167
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:30,552
She's your wife.

168
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:38,461
How'd you get a court order
to dig them up so fast?

169
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,042
We just needed the guy's consent.

170
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,833
- You find anything?
- Not yet.

171
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:43,650
But you're just in time to do the dad.

172
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:49,933
Doctor House?

173
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,499
He'll be back in the morning.

174
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,518
I read in the paper

175
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:54,344
you're treating a police officer.

176
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:55,950
- Donny Compson?
- Second floor.

177
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:57,508
A nurse will help you find him.

178
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,266
I don't want to see him.

179
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:01,894
Donny and I used to go out
a long time ago.

180
00:09:01,994 --> 00:09:03,802
He doesn't want to see me.
I don't want to see him.

181
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,977
So did you come to see me
for personal advice?

182
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,363
You're looking for genetic conditions,

183
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:10,392
which makes sense, with what
happened to his dad and grandpa.

184
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,748
Unless you were
his girlfriend and his sister,

185
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:14,053
you got nothing to worry about.

186
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,194
I'm not worried about me.

187
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,417
Donny doesn't know this,

188
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:17,785
but he has a son.

189
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:23,738
Dial extension 742.

190
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:26,152
Tell Dr. Foreman you got
some cool information.

191
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:27,241
Good night.

192
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:25,389
You okay?

193
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:27,380
Yeah, fine.

194
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:00,948
Couldn't find any
consistent genetic mutations

195
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:03,361
across 15 areas
between Donny's ancestors,

196
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:05,471
possibly indicating there isn't one.

197
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:06,951
But the son gives us a new data point.

198
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:07,977
And undegraded DNA.

199
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:09,269
- I thought he didn't want kids.
- He didn't.

200
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:10,304
Where's House?

201
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:11,472
"Dear bleeding hearts,

202
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,429
"since your patient's
med history is a coincidence,

203
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:15,598
"and he isn't...

204
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:19,309
"sick,

205
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:20,559
"I've gone back to school.

206
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:21,809
"Back in 120 hours."

207
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:23,405
Charming. I'll get a blood sample.

208
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:25,508
If we're looking for something
as subtle as a mutation,

209
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:27,576
it makes sense to get the DNA
where it's most pure.

210
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:30,116
You're gonna ask the mom to
consent to a bone marrow biopsy?

211
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:31,798
She wants to know if there's
something wrong with Donny

212
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:32,857
just as badly as we do.

213
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:33,796
Right.

214
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:36,092
Spike a ten-year-old's hip
because grandpa was sick.

215
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:36,985
If she's right...

216
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,105
save two people.

217
00:11:43,714 --> 00:11:44,758
I don't want to.

218
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:48,498
Can we speak outside for a moment?

219
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:50,468
Yeah.

220
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:58,477
You need to tell him.

221
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,613
I can't.

222
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,331
His father is down that hallway

223
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,466
through those double doors.

224
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,987
I've been lying to him his whole life.

225
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,121
What's he gonna think of me?

226
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:07,238
You're trying to protect him.

227
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,788
Donny never wanted kids.

228
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:12,866
He certainly doesn't want to meet him.

229
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:14,900
If Donny does die, this could be

230
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:16,755
Michael's only chance to meet his father.

231
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:31,817
After administration of immunoglobulin,

232
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:34,624
patient had no further pain, and
overnight liver function tests

233
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:35,672
are now normal.

234
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:36,910
Patient's ready to be released.

235
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:39,234
Stats are dropping.

236
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,103
- Doctor Singh?
- She's choking.

237
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,697
- On your fingers.
- She can't breathe.

238
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:44,488
House...

239
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,248
Please take your finger off the test button.

240
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:49,327
Oh!

241
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:51,959
See. Wow, sorry about that.

242
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,505
I could've slit her throat.

243
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:54,883
Well, we're all here to learn.

244
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,572
You know, Dr. Cuddy warned me about you.

245
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:57,801
She tell you how to stop me?

246
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:01,593
Look, I'm asking you
as an adult to please stop.

247
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,534
well, that obviously
didn't come from her.

248
00:13:04,195 --> 00:13:05,085
But fair enough.

249
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,293
Excellent presentation, Nona.

250
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,182
Ah!

251
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,450
Now I've done it.

252
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,411
There's urine everywhere!

253
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:15,558
Gosh. The great thing

254
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,432
about the teacher-student
relationship is the teacher

255
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,573
can often learn more from the student.

256
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,066
You learned anything yet?

257
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,499
You have a son.

258
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,476
I was pregnant when we broke up.

259
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:34,746
I'm sorry I never told you,

260
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:36,423
but I knew how you felt
about having kids.

261
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:38,677
You had no right.

262
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:40,047
Maybe.

263
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,023
It's a little late for that.

264
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:47,854
He's here.

265
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:49,377
He wants to meet you.

266
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:50,560
I don't want to meet him.

267
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:52,414
I've never asked you for a dime.

268
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:53,724
He's here to help find

269
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:55,168
whatever's wrong with your heart.

270
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:56,358
I didn't ask him.

271
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,989
I didn't want him.

272
00:13:58,099 --> 00:13:59,135
Just say hi to him.

273
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:14,828
Hi.

274
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:17,299
I'm Michael.

275
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:19,412
Hi.

276
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:22,168
I'm your...

277
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:24,278
Yeah, your mother told me.

278
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:27,641
When you get better,

279
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:30,313
maybe we could do something.

280
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:34,121
See a movie?

281
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:39,167
No.

282
00:14:40,404 --> 00:14:41,986
My dad died when I was your age.

283
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,212
It was the most painful thing
I ever went through.

284
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,587
Trust me, as much as I'm sure
this hurts right now, it's better.

285
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:51,923
Please take him out of here.

286
00:15:01,557 --> 00:15:03,901
Chromosomes for 28
cardiovascular conditions

287
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:05,369
are normally numbered in structure.

288
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,749
No translocations,
deletions, or inversions.

289
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:11,214
I didn't notice that
the kid's D-A-D-D-Y chromosome

290
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:12,766
has been severely damaged

291
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:14,829
by someone else's
bleeding heart chromosome.

292
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:17,129
It was the only way to get
Michael to do the marrow biopsy.

293
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:18,392
I'm sure there are plenty of lies

294
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:19,523
would've worked just as well,

295
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,478
except without the years of therapy.

296
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:22,857
- Don't you have school?
- Recess.

297
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:24,700
So where does that leave us?

298
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:25,655
Chase?

299
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,268
Sorry. What?

300
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:30,583
I was saying, "do you think these shoes

301
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:31,986
"work in this color?"

302
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,060
- Send him home.
- He's not gonna believe he's healthy.

303
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:36,437
You're not very good at your job.

304
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,522
- You don't deserve candy.
- He's been preparing

305
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:40,533
his whole life to die at age 40.

306
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:41,726
He's had dozens of doctors

307
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:42,994
tell him he's fine.

308
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:44,576
You think you can change his thinking?

309
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,706
Yeah, I do. Chase, walk with me.

310
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,586
Great contributions back there.

311
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,507
There's no case. I had nothing to add.

312
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,436
You had nothing to add...

313
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:57,192
Because you were distracted.

314
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,635
A little devil on your shoulder

315
00:15:58,713 --> 00:16:01,586
told you to kill a guy, and now
the little angel won't shut up,

316
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:04,140
telling you you're gonna burn
in a lake of fire.

317
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:05,464
I'm fine.

318
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,529
You shouldn't be.

319
00:16:07,704 --> 00:16:08,634
Talk to someone.

320
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,711
Docs fixed me up in seven weeks.

321
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,501
You're... ten minutes, tops.

322
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:18,025
Thanks.

323
00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:21,161
Glad we had this little moment.

324
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:22,084
Come on.

325
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:25,542
I'm Dr. House.

326
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:27,265
You couldn't find anything, could you?

327
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,536
You have ortoli syndrome.

328
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:30,937
Dr. Chase?

329
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:33,428
- You sure?
- Tests don't lie.

330
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:34,831
Right.

331
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:36,237
Uh...

332
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,335
Well, it's... It's a...

333
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:41,324
It's a very rare disorder

334
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,864
that short-circuits the adrenals,

335
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:45,410
which short-circuits the heart.

336
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:46,981
Blah, blah, blah, blah. Who cares

337
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:48,480
about medical mumbo jumbo?

338
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:49,534
Tell him the treatment.

339
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:52,430
It's... well, it's... It's complicated.

340
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:54,951
Doctors always want to make
everything sound so complicated.

341
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:55,991
It's Nabasynth.

342
00:16:57,062 --> 00:16:57,967
- What?
- Nabasynth.

343
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,289
Yes.

344
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:03,597
So all we have to do now
is write a prescription

345
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:06,070
and, uh, have him pick up the pills.

346
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:14,956
That's it?

347
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:18,171
I take some pills, and I'm gonna be okay?

348
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,594
The real tragedy here is

349
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,668
that the tiburon swab technology

350
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:24,508
didn't exist to detect ortoli
back in your dad's day.

351
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:29,196
He could've lived.

352
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:35,669
Thank you.

353
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,673
You'll sign these discharge papers,

354
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:44,053
I'll get you a bottle of meds.

355
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,987
Take one twice a day for a week,

356
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:47,734
you'll live a long, healthy life.

357
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:25,387
Answer the door, House.

358
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:26,632
It's got to be for you.

359
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:28,748
Are you watching tv?

360
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,167
It's the door!

361
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:36,131
- Were you on the phone?
- No.

362
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:38,365
- Just now, were you talking?
- No. I'm alone.

363
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:40,497
You okay, House?

364
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:45,318
Why are you here?

365
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:49,087
Donny collapsed four hours
after we discharged him.

366
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:50,642
He's dead.

367
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,459
His apartment manager found him

368
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,670
on the floor in the laundry room.

369
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:01,074
Said he wasn't breathing.

370
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,268
He called the EMTs, but it was too late.

371
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:07,234
I sent the guy home with mints.

372
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:09,554
Whatever it is, we all missed it.

373
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:12,451
I missed the fact that
there was something to miss.

374
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:16,324
What is wrong with me?

375
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:18,227
You had good reason.

376
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:20,652
Patient presented with no symptoms,

377
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:22,414
and all his tests came back negative.

378
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:25,864
What's the official cause of death?

379
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:28,343
Autopsy hasn't been performed yet.

380
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:30,241
EMTs brought him to general,

381
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:32,843
but I requested they ship him back

382
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:34,827
to our morgue for the postmortem.

383
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:38,727
Good.

384
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:44,267
Hon. Wake up.

385
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,270
Why are you dressed?

386
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:50,898
You can't sleep?

387
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:53,324
I want to go tell Cheryl
that Donny died.

388
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:56,401
It's 4:00 in the morning.

389
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:57,903
They're nearly two hours away.

390
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,172
I figure by the time
I get there, she'll be awake.

391
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,573
Babe, come back to bed.

392
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:03,186
Call her in a few hours.

393
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,175
It's the sort of thing
she needs to hear face-to-face.

394
00:20:14,618 --> 00:20:15,892
Is everything okay?

395
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,061
Everything's fine.

396
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:19,055
Why?

397
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:21,876
Last week, I understood
that you were stressed out

398
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:24,177
about the Dibala "M" & "M,"
and I gave you your space.

399
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:27,472
But that's over now,
and you're still acting...

400
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:31,765
I'm worried about you.

401
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:34,911
Don't be.

402
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,045
I'm fine.

403
00:20:37,585 --> 00:20:38,561
Really.

404
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:40,890
And you'd tell me if you weren't?

405
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:44,120
Promise?

406
00:20:46,256 --> 00:20:47,160
Yeah.

407
00:20:48,691 --> 00:20:49,451
Okay.

408
00:20:52,964 --> 00:20:53,650
Hey.

409
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,673
I love you.

410
00:20:57,476 --> 00:20:58,755
I love you too.

411
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:09,562
Donny Compson, age 39.

412
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:32,381
Can we cut to the money shot?

413
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:35,822
It's his heart,
so let's look at his heart.

414
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:38,613
Nice y-incision.

415
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:41,224
You can't perform an autopsy
without a medical license.

416
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:42,532
Really?

417
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:45,019
'Cause I don't think there's
anything I could screw up

418
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:46,387
that we haven't already screwed up.

419
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,369
Opening postmortem incision.

420
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:56,971
Beginning at the midline of the sternum.

421
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:10,206
That's odd.

422
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:12,311
It almost looks like he's...

423
00:22:12,421 --> 00:22:13,508
Bleeding.

424
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,319
I think the autopsy's gonna have
to wait a little bit.

425
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:34,438
He was briefly conscious,

426
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:36,543
then his systolic dipped below 60,

427
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:37,656
and he was out again.

428
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:39,556
Differential diagnosis for resurrection.

429
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:41,160
- Go.
- Obviously he wasn't dead.

430
00:22:41,262 --> 00:22:42,840
His heart slowed enough
that the EMTs...

431
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:45,406
Yes, the fact that he's not dead
means we did absolutely

432
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,428
nothing wrong.

433
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,605
There's several documented cases

434
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:50,057
where tetrodotoxin ingestion
caused apparent death.

435
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:52,033
It wasn't something he ate.
It's something he already had.

436
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:52,915
And his dad,

437
00:22:52,984 --> 00:22:54,954
- and his grandpa, and...
- Extreme bradycardia

438
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,966
could be caused by sick sinus syndrome.

439
00:22:57,051 --> 00:22:59,202
- Sinoatrial block.
- What if it's not his heart?

440
00:23:00,287 --> 00:23:02,905
Let's work from the tenuous assumption

441
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:04,012
that we're not idiots

442
00:23:04,146 --> 00:23:05,812
who've spent days examining a heart

443
00:23:05,896 --> 00:23:07,282
up, down, sideways...

444
00:23:07,364 --> 00:23:09,080
Declaring it healthy just a few hours

445
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:10,511
before it basically shut down.

446
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,347
So we need to think about causes
in places you didn't look.

447
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,537
Could be metabolic.

448
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,136
You okay?

449
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,064
Yeah.

450
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:26,937
What about a genetic predisposition

451
00:23:27,027 --> 00:23:28,517
to an autoimmune disease?

452
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:30,080
Isolated anti-ro antibody

453
00:23:30,178 --> 00:23:31,557
could cause complete heart block.

454
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:33,070
Could also be passed
through four generations.

455
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,344
Autoimmune it is.

456
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:35,546
Start him on steroids.

457
00:23:41,348 --> 00:23:43,784
Hey. How you feeling?

458
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:46,985
My whole head is killing me.

459
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,776
You just came through a severe trauma.

460
00:23:51,112 --> 00:23:52,718
What do you remember?

461
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,984
I was changing my laundry
over to the dryer.

462
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:01,740
That's it?

463
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:03,104
You were declared dead.

464
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:04,754
You made it all the way to autopsy.

465
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:07,792
My jaw aches.

466
00:24:09,452 --> 00:24:12,302
And obviously I don't have
ortoli syndrome.

467
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:14,954
It's hard to get too excited

468
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,257
about coming back from the dead

469
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,117
when anything I do,
anything you give me...

470
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:19,468
It all ends the same way.

471
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:37,288
Outer and middle ear respond well.

472
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:39,393
Hearing thresholds are normal
at all frequencies.

473
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:40,859
Eardrum is perfectly healthy.

474
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:42,315
What if I, uh...

475
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,977
If I sometimes hear whispering?

476
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:46,620
Then you're probably hearing
someone whispering.

477
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,554
I had some dental work done
in the Philippines

478
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,708
when I was a kid.

479
00:24:51,795 --> 00:24:53,384
Adjoining metal fillings could corrode

480
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:55,017
and pick up AM radio signals.

481
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:56,018
Open your mouth.

482
00:24:58,446 --> 00:24:59,667
Your fillings don't touch.

483
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:04,091
So there's no reason
for me to be hearing things.

484
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:06,260
I can only tell you that you're
hearing sounds as you should.

485
00:25:06,343 --> 00:25:07,789
If you're also hearing
sounds that you shouldn't,

486
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:08,932
well, that would be psychosis.

487
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:10,712
You'd have to talk
to someone who does brain.

488
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:11,761
I only do ears.

489
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:22,198
Bravo!

490
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:25,854
It's amazing how
you did 120 hours in one day.

491
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:28,382
I wasn't on my best behavior.

492
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:29,534
I admit.

493
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:30,598
Allow me.

494
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,368
From now on, I'm gonna supervise

495
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:35,774
- your practicum requirements.
- That won't be necessary.

496
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,440
You wanna annoy another doctor first?

497
00:25:37,585 --> 00:25:39,082
- Eventually...
- It's not necessary,

498
00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:41,446
because I'm not ready
to be a doctor again.

499
00:25:44,774 --> 00:25:45,620
I'm sorry.

500
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,540
Are you sleeping out here?

501
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:10,052
Just... dozed off in front of the tv.

502
00:26:10,157 --> 00:26:11,108
With bedding?

503
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,098
Maybe!

504
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:14,187
I can't sleep in there.

505
00:26:14,321 --> 00:26:15,701
The heater's screwed up.

506
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,918
If you need to talk...

507
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:19,748
If... If you need more help...

508
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,127
I'm just tired.

509
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,371
I'm right here.

510
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:24,527
Great.

511
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:26,788
Can you be right here somewhere else?

512
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,457
My jaw still hurts.

513
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,057
My tooth... Actually, a lot.

514
00:26:38,172 --> 00:26:40,120
I'm sorry, you're maxed out
on your pain meds.

515
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,246
Try to sleep.

516
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:07,314
Dentist looked at
the tooth the guy pulled out.

517
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:08,606
There was nothing wrong with it.

518
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,051
So aside from him being an idiot,

519
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,237
what else have we learned?

520
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:13,772
The pain is real.
It's coming from somewhere.

521
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:16,015
What about bone cancer?

522
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,439
You can't connect
bone cancer to the heart.

523
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,364
House figure this can wait
till the morning?

524
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,890
Actually, he told Cuddy
he's not ready to work.

525
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:24,513
He quit?

526
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,624
- Apparently.
- It's a power play.

527
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:27,849
He'll be back tomorrow.

528
00:27:27,976 --> 00:27:30,987
Bone cancer could trigger
a paraneoplastic syndrome,

529
00:27:31,105 --> 00:27:32,251
which shuts down the heart.

530
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:34,348
Primary bone cancer isn't hereditary.

531
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:35,879
Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

532
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:38,833
It's hereditary, and it increases
a person's risk of having bone cancer.

533
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:43,494
You have another theory?

534
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:45,796
My theory is it's not bone cancer.

535
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:48,657
Gamma survey would locate the tumors.

536
00:29:05,765 --> 00:29:07,311
I had pea soup today.

537
00:29:08,525 --> 00:29:10,360
You'd love my breath right now.

538
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,338
I didn't get a chance to run tonight.

539
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:15,469
House is... is having issues.

540
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,311
I missed you a lot today.

541
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:22,435
All I want to do is...

542
00:29:26,287 --> 00:29:27,216
You know.

543
00:29:32,502 --> 00:29:35,150
No cancers on the lateral cuneiform bone.

544
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:36,984
Navicular's also clean.

545
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:39,210
Chase is lying to me.

546
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,195
And I know you know.

547
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:43,810
Tell me what's going on, please.

548
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:45,386
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told him...

549
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:46,848
Talk to your spouse.

550
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:55,879
No breakfast?

551
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:57,723
Not today.

552
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,241
I'm hallucinating.

553
00:30:03,874 --> 00:30:04,952
What happened?

554
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:06,561
It's nothing visual this time.

555
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:09,412
I hear whispering.

556
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:12,073
Is that why
you've been acting so weird?

557
00:30:12,272 --> 00:30:13,787
- Is that why you quit?
- I'm losing it.

558
00:30:15,017 --> 00:30:16,620
I'm sure there's
a rational explanation.

559
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:19,635
- The wind? A neighbor's TV?
- I checked everything.

560
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,530
What's really scary
is that I hear whispering

561
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:22,984
while not on Vicodin.

562
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:28,252
I'm gonna check myself back into Mayfield.

563
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:31,466
Okay.

564
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:36,010
Okay?

565
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,890
You don't think there might be
a logical explanation?

566
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:42,099
Something I missed?

567
00:30:42,202 --> 00:30:43,667
You're the smartest guy I know.

568
00:30:43,761 --> 00:30:45,339
If you haven't thought of it,
it doesn't exist.

569
00:30:46,236 --> 00:30:47,311
I'll drive you over.

570
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,076
I just need to make some tea first.

571
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:54,294
You know.

572
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,722
That you're an ass? Yeah.

573
00:30:58,245 --> 00:31:00,220
You overheard me talking
to my dead girlfriend

574
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,811
and thought to yourself, "Hmm...

575
00:31:01,912 --> 00:31:03,706
"What kind of fun can I have with this?"

576
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:05,063
Why are you talking to her?

577
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:06,407
You run out of living people?

578
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:07,802
You can talk to me. I'm right here.

579
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,376
I miss her.

580
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,769
Talking to her makes me feel better.

581
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,004
You don't.

582
00:31:15,648 --> 00:31:17,680
Patient Lauren Maybaum, 27,

583
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:20,634
presented two days ago
with severe abdominal pain.

584
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:22,321
Sorry I'm late.

585
00:31:22,512 --> 00:31:24,009
Yesterday you said you weren't ready.

586
00:31:24,097 --> 00:31:24,875
Yesterday I wasn't.

587
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:26,686
- Today I am.
- And tomorrow?

588
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28,956
Is it possible for me
to get a five-day forecast?

589
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:31,238
I'm feeling much better.
Thank you for not asking.

590
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:32,854
Either you did have a problem...

591
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:34,319
Which I can't ignore.

592
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:36,160
Or you were jerking me around...

593
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:39,215
- Which I can't ignore.
- You are a woman. You can do anything.

594
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:41,765
For example, I can talk to you outside.

595
00:31:45,694 --> 00:31:47,481
Are you sure you're only one woman?

596
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:54,156
This is the part where you play
the employee, and I play the boss.

597
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:56,107
I can see your nipples. Your turn.

598
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:58,541
- These kids are...
- No wonder she hates him.

599
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:00,853
Mm, that's not hate.

600
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:03,392
- It's foreplay.
- It's inappropriate.

601
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:08,514
Gamma survey revealed no tumors.

602
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:10,413
So it's not bone cancer.

603
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:12,205
Where's Chase?

604
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,677
Don't know.

605
00:32:14,146 --> 00:32:14,813
Hm.

606
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:16,467
Two mysteries, cool.

607
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,222
Theories?

608
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,365
Did I come in too soon?

609
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:24,336
Okay, I'm gonna take another lap.

610
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:27,230
And I want three new ideas
by the time I come back.

611
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:28,853
One of them's got to be not stupid.

612
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:36,664
Where there's pain... there's nerves.

613
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:41,153
Hereditary sensory
autonomic neuropathy, type one.

614
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:43,018
Miscommunication in the brain stem

615
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,972
mistakes nerve pain for tooth pain.

616
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,228
It would explain the bradycardia too.

617
00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:47,946
And I like the word "hereditary"
in the title.

618
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:49,265
Carbamazepine fixes him.

619
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:50,841
I'll get him started on the medication.

620
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:53,785
Nope, Chase specifically asked
if he could do it.

621
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:01,552
Sleep at home.

622
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:04,725
So I didn't do the gamma survey.

623
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:07,007
- Bbone cancer?
- No.

624
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:09,263
You should congratulate me
for not wasting your time.

625
00:33:09,358 --> 00:33:10,419
Are you getting some help?

626
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:12,979
Or is this the way things
are gonna be from now on?

627
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:16,311
What's pathetic is
you haven't gotten help

628
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:18,960
because you wanna feel bad.

629
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:20,547
You wanna suffer,

630
00:33:21,148 --> 00:33:23,206
'cause if you feel guilty,
then you're not a psychopath.

631
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:26,009
Patient needs some Carbamazepine.

632
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:28,262
Now, I don't care how much
that room scares you,

633
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:30,741
you're doing your job.

634
00:33:45,795 --> 00:33:48,198
How long before you
cross this one off the list?

635
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,193
A couple of hours.

636
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:57,360
You ever shoot anyone?

637
00:33:58,447 --> 00:33:59,358
Twice.

638
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:01,865
You ever kill anyone?

639
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:03,794
No.

640
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:05,811
I know a few guys who did, though.

641
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:07,789
Did they ever get over it?

642
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,757
A captain I know compares it
to taking out the trash,

643
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:11,959
like it's nothing.

644
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:14,652
Other hand, I got an ex-partner

645
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,511
who nearly drank himself into oblivion.

646
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:18,936
Did he get help?

647
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:20,224
Yeah.

648
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,347
Help didn't help.

649
00:34:28,948 --> 00:34:30,186
Oh, God!

650
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:31,734
What is it?

651
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:33,915
I went to the bathroom.

652
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:40,322
Patient's lost bowel control.

653
00:34:40,465 --> 00:34:41,868
Means we were wrong about h-san,

654
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,930
And it means he's getting worse fast.

655
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,261
Wouldn't want to be the duty nurse

656
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:47,208
assigned to his floor. Get it?

657
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:48,856
"Doody" nurse?

658
00:34:50,064 --> 00:34:51,551
Fine. Do the doctor thing.

659
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:53,056
No an autoimmune disorder
could explain...

660
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:54,707
We put him on steroids.
He didn't respond.

661
00:34:54,824 --> 00:34:56,351
- It's not autoimmune.
- Could be Wilson's disease.

662
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,396
A disease that advanced
would've hit the liver.

663
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:00,276
It is possible the liver's so far gone,

664
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:01,549
the labs look normal.

665
00:35:02,562 --> 00:35:03,765
It's worth a shot.

666
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:06,391
Go treat with Penicillamine.

667
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:09,613
And when he doesn't get better,
come back quickly,

668
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:11,178
So we can get one more shot at it.

669
00:35:16,495 --> 00:35:18,452
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

670
00:35:24,804 --> 00:35:25,876
Take your time.

671
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:30,852
How long has it been
since your last confession?

672
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:32,042
I killed a man.

673
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:34,513
Oh?

674
00:35:35,194 --> 00:35:37,110
But it was the right thing to do.

675
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:42,346
Who lives or dies
is not your decision to make.

676
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:45,731
Sometimes in the operating room
it feels like it.

677
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,046
I'm a doctor.

678
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,571
Well, then you should know
more than anybody

679
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:54,272
that every human life is sacred.

680
00:35:55,478 --> 00:35:56,285
Why?

681
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,327
Tell me what's sacred about a dictator

682
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:02,843
that kills hundreds
of thousands of his own people.

683
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,250
What is sacred about a doctor
who kills a patient?

684
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,645
Is it just the slippery slope
you're worried about?

685
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,320
Afraid that forgiving me for killing

686
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,113
the worst person on Earth,
such a bad president.

687
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:20,575
I promise...

688
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,650
I won't tell anyone.

689
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:31,068
Just forgive me.

690
00:36:32,345 --> 00:36:35,294
Saying ten Hail Marys
isn't going to do you any good.

691
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:37,926
Then what do I have to do?

692
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:42,396
What does God need me to do?

693
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,058
You can't have absolution

694
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:46,103
without first taking responsibility.

695
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:49,009
You have to turn yourself into the police.

696
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,626
And go to jail for the rest of my life?

697
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:54,782
What's just about that?

698
00:36:57,621 --> 00:36:59,889
I did the right thing.

699
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:02,139
There has to be another way.

700
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:05,457
You want absolution,
I've told you how to get it.

701
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,570
Send this into the state licensing board.

702
00:37:30,904 --> 00:37:32,688
I've signed off on all your hours.

703
00:37:34,186 --> 00:37:34,893
Why?

704
00:37:34,997 --> 00:37:36,588
Because it's easier this way.

705
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:38,619
You're uncomfortable with me.

706
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:40,064
No.

707
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:42,733
Going by the book was pointless.

708
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:44,106
You were gonna learn nothing.

709
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,274
Good, I thought it was
because of the sexual tension.

710
00:37:46,386 --> 00:37:47,542
There was no sexual tension.

711
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:48,518
There was tension.

712
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,621
And... it made me feel funny, so...

713
00:37:52,612 --> 00:37:53,553
Here.

714
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,312
That's too bad.

715
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:00,317
I was kind of getting
into the whole

716
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,257
hot-for-teacher thing.

717
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:04,772
You sure you're okay?

718
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,609
Yeah. False alarm.

719
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:11,612
What about us?

720
00:38:12,887 --> 00:38:13,999
We're good...

721
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:15,319
Just like this.

722
00:38:15,413 --> 00:38:16,947
You press my buttons, I press yours.

723
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,143
But buttons, you mean...

724
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:25,730
Oh...

725
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:34,393
You do make me feel funny.

726
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:44,376
You're not gonna die.

727
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,288
I've accepted it.

728
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:47,589
It's okay.

729
00:38:48,936 --> 00:38:51,137
In addition to high arches

730
00:38:51,215 --> 00:38:54,043
and some crystal bowl
in the shape of a tuna,

731
00:38:54,217 --> 00:38:57,636
you also inherited
a self-destruct button.

732
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:00,754
It forms in the brain stem.

733
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:02,362
Technically, it's an aneurysm.

734
00:39:02,464 --> 00:39:03,508
Presses on the nerves,

735
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:05,770
that control everything
from tooth pain to heart rate.

736
00:39:06,226 --> 00:39:08,018
As you get older, it gets bigger,

737
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,304
until finally...

738
00:39:09,852 --> 00:39:10,783
The button...

739
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:12,994
Which I'll call
intracranial berry aneurysm,

740
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:14,685
I had a friend in
high school with that name...

741
00:39:15,316 --> 00:39:17,436
Stops the signal from
your brain to your heart.

742
00:39:17,516 --> 00:39:19,031
And bam!

743
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:22,096
How do I know you're not
still lying to me?

744
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,423
Saying I'm healthy just
to make me feel better?

745
00:39:24,543 --> 00:39:25,913
It does sound that way, doesn't it?

746
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:28,263
But this time, no sugar pills.

747
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:29,672
I'm gonna cut into your brain

748
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,421
to make you think that I'm fixing it.

749
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:33,680
And if our fake tests confirm it,

750
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:36,204
I'm gonna be cutting
into your son's brain too,

751
00:39:36,313 --> 00:39:37,832
I'm just that committed.

752
00:39:38,571 --> 00:39:39,982
Michael's gonna be okay?

753
00:39:41,892 --> 00:39:44,102
Unless he walks out of here
and gets run over by a bus,

754
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:46,464
in which case, I will
reconsider your fate argument.

755
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:50,443
You want to give him a call?

756
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:53,178
Visiting hours
don't apply to my patients.

757
00:39:54,148 --> 00:39:55,037
Yeah...

758
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:56,331
In a bit.

759
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:58,517
Yeah.

760
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:00,549
That's what I thought.

761
00:40:01,513 --> 00:40:03,968
The "saving the kid
from pain" stuff was crap.

762
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,051
You just don't want
anything in your life

763
00:40:06,124 --> 00:40:07,818
that won't let you do whatever
the hell you want to do

764
00:40:07,914 --> 00:40:09,196
whenever the hell you want to do it.

765
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:10,992
You've had it easy.

766
00:40:11,388 --> 00:40:13,201
Sorry to screw you up.

767
00:40:49,696 --> 00:40:51,293
Maybe when we get out of here...

768
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,507
What kind of movies you like?

769
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:07,982
He's been missing for eight hours.

770
00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:09,093
Robert Chase.

771
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,282
- C-H-A-S-E.
- Hey!

772
00:41:15,797 --> 00:41:17,633
Never mind, he just walked in, sorry.

773
00:41:18,357 --> 00:41:19,697
You could've called me.

774
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,494
Oh, I-I forgot.

775
00:41:21,594 --> 00:41:23,068
To call me? It's 2:00 in the morning.

776
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:24,444
Where were you?

777
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,844
You're drunk.

778
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:27,206
All right, I...

779
00:41:28,806 --> 00:41:31,034
I needed to get wasted. I did.

780
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:33,846
And now I'm better.

781
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:35,808
What aren't you telling me?

782
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:37,059
Nothing.

783
00:42:22,868 --> 00:42:23,942
Hi, dad.

784
00:42:29,725 --> 00:42:30,944
I have been...

785
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:34,470
focusing on wrong thing.

786
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:39,478
There were some good times.

787
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:45,234
Wilson.

788
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,344
This is stupid.

789
00:42:50,058 --> 00:42:53,943
You see, he really is getting better.
