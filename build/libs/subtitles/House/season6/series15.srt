1
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:37,918
it's estimated
the observable universe

2
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:40,954
is 93 billion
light-years across.

3
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:43,888
It's probably
more accure...

4
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,058
<i>I'm gonna be so far away.</i>

5
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,896
I don't care.
I don't want to break up.

6
00:00:48,963 --> 00:00:50,765
I'll come on the weekends.

7
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:53,234
Stanford's on the other side
of the country.

8
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,237
My dad has, like, ten million
frequent flyer miles.

9
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,473
He won't care.

10
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,083
Oh.

11
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:07,017
<i>Are we all right over here?</i>

12
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:09,651
Uh, yes, Mr. Damon.

13
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:12,083
I just had something
caught in my throat.

14
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:13,549
Boy, you know you're not
supposed to have

15
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:14,517
any food
or drinks in here.

16
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:15,484
Oh, it's just water.

17
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:16,685
I have a cough.

18
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:18,687
I didn't want
to disturb anyone.

19
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:21,516
We can only observe
4% of the universe.

20
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:22,680
<i>The rest of it</i>
<i>is unaccounted for.</i>

21
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:25,714
I never knew you
were such a good liar.

22
00:01:25,782 --> 00:01:27,215
Well, a little more vodka,
and you might find out

23
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:28,616
some more things
you didn't know about me.

24
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:30,751
Really?

25
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:31,718
<i>Nicholas.</i>

26
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:32,719
Yes, sir?

27
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:34,353
What conclusions can we draw

28
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:36,921
from the incredible
number of stars?

29
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:39,990
That the movie's either gonna be
really good or really bad.

30
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:43,688
I was thinking more
about the implications

31
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:46,457
for extraterrestrial life.

32
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:50,026
Well, I guess if there's
an infinite number of stars,

33
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,060
odds are there's at least
one galaxy with life

34
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,094
other than our own

35
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:54,829
or

36
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:57,964
pr... not?

37
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:00,966
Or our solar system
is somehow unique.

38
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,668
The question then becomes,
"in what way?"

39
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:05,069
The question then becomes,

40
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:09,473
"could you possibly teach us
anything more useless?"

41
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,443
What are you looking at?

42
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:16,413
Abby?

43
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:18,448
Oh, my God. Something's wrong.
She's not breathing.

44
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:22,151
Abby?

45
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:24,486
Call 911.

??? ???

49
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,986
Would you mind
at least putting a napkin

50
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:16,988
under your jelly toast?

51
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:19,990
Get a table, and I won't
eat it on the couch.

52
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:21,724
Yes, you will.

53
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,226
But I won't have
a good excuse.

54
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:26,662
Why don't you
go get a table?

55
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:27,996
Not my condo.

56
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,198
You have my permission.

57
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:31,732
Pick out
whatever you want.

58
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Then it would be
a reflection of me, not you.

59
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:34,801
That wouldn't be right.

60
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:37,303
No, it would be
a reflection of the fact

61
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:38,737
that the guy who's been
mooching off of me

62
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:40,239
<i>for as long</i>
<i>as I can remember</i>

63
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,107
isn't a complete ingrate.

64
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:49,179
You've never
furnished a home.

65
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:50,313
I have furnished
a bunch of homes.

66
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,515
No, you've married
a bunch of women

67
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:53,816
who furnished
a bunch of homes.

68
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,417
You want to eat
off something? Fine.

69
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,619
Move your piano in here
and eat off that.

70
00:03:57,686 --> 00:03:59,987
You're afraid.

71
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:01,955
Of a dining table?

72
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:04,291
You know, they don't
actually come to life

73
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:06,458
when you put a knob
off your bedpost on them.

74
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,193
You are what you sit in.

75
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,895
Your friends, your job,
your furnishings--

76
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:12,295
it all defines you.

77
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:14,596
You don't really
believe that.

78
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:16,531
You just don't want to do
the shopping.

79
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,900
Buy some furniture,

80
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,135
or admit that you're
empty inside.

81
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:27,472
Huh.

82
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,009
X-rays confirm the fluid

83
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:34,376
that almost suffocated
her to death

84
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:35,811
was from pulmonary edema.

85
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,113
Means the problem's either
in her heart or lungs.

86
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:39,514
Tox screen's clean
for everything

87
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:42,551
except the alcohol,
and her B.A.C. was barely .05.

88
00:04:42,618 --> 00:04:44,519
That means she only had
one or two drinks, tops.

89
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:46,855
And there's no sign
of trauma.

90
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,856
How'd you know?

91
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:50,391
Because if there was,

92
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,326
Cuddy wouldn't have needed me
to take the case.

93
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:53,928
How do you know Cuddy--
<i>Foreman's the only one</i>

94
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:56,630
with the balls to take a case
without checking with me,

95
00:04:56,698 --> 00:04:58,031
<i>and he's still</i>
<i>working on breakfast,</i>

96
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,632
<i>which means that the...</i>

97
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,901
18...

98
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,936
no, 17-year-old
honor student--

99
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,805
<i>Cuddy has a soft spot</i>

100
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,642
for smart girls,
and they don't start drinking

101
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,978
until second semester,
senior year.

102
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,947
So either you think
that smart women

103
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,614
look out for each other,
which means you're an idiot,

104
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:19,517
or you think Cuddy's
not smart, which means...

105
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,985
well, I guess
it's the same both ways.

106
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,622
Then how did you--

107
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,626
Picture fell out of the file.
She looks smart.

108
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:27,762
<i>Where's Taub?</i>
You don't already know?

109
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,097
Yeah, he's at home
in a fight with his wife.

110
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:32,299
I'm just curious
what he wanted me to know.

111
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,001
His car has a flat tire.
He's waiting for a tow truck.

112
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,769
<i>Qhat about rising</i>
<i>blood pressure</i>

113
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:36,970
<i>from binge drinking?</i>

114
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:38,338
It could set off
a hypertensive crisis,

115
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:39,439
cause heart failure.

116
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,441
Two drinks
is hardly a binge.

117
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,743
Certainly not
if you're an Aussie.

118
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,079
But when
an american schoolgirl

119
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:46,747
has two drinks
before 10:00 am,

120
00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:49,350
it's a pretty sure bet that
the plan is to have a lot more.

121
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:51,118
<i>Probably wasn't the first time</i>
<i>she had that plan.</i>

122
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:52,920
<i>We'll get</i>
<i>a C-13-pyruvate mri</i>

123
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:54,722
to check for cardiac
lactic-acid levels.

124
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,223
Someone call Taub.

125
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,260
Tell him to cut the ball
and chain on his own time.

126
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:01,195
We're arguing
about couples yoga?

127
00:06:01,263 --> 00:06:02,163
<i>No.</i>

128
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,031
We're arguing over the fact

129
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:05,533
that we don't ever do
anything together anymore.

130
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,935
We don't ever do
anything together?

131
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:09,969
Chris, I love you, but I swear,
if you start talking to me

132
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,237
like I'm on
the witness stand again,

133
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,505
I'm gonna break your neck.

134
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,073
Honey, we do stuff
together all the time.

135
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:15,808
Really? Like what?

136
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,578
Besides sleeping, watching tv,
going out to dinner,

137
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,146
what do we do together,

138
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,481
just the two of us?

139
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,651
We...

140
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,221
You don't like
going out to dinner?

141
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,156
All right,
I'll do the yoga.

142
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,190
Forget it.

143
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,892
Now you don't want me
to do it?

144
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,360
Just go to work.

145
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:36,494
No.

146
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,164
I'm not leaving
until we work this out.

147
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,405
I'm fine.
Please, just go.

148
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:09,113
<i>Where's Abby Nash?</i>

149
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:10,746
I'm Nick, her boyfriend.

150
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:11,713
<i>This is my dad.</i>
Hi.

151
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,248
You can wait in--

152
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:14,381
Where is she?

153
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:15,649
Is she okay?

154
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:18,715
She's having some tests run.

155
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,948
Is she okay?

156
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:26,552
We think her drinking
may have damaged her heart.

157
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,254
Her heart?

158
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:30,756
No, she doesn't drink,

159
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:32,323
Not that much.

160
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:33,358
Just when she's at school?

161
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:35,092
Nick, what's he
talking about?

162
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,295
It was a field trip.
One of the kids had a fake I.D.

163
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:39,796
But, dad, you know Abby.
Tell him.

164
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:40,964
Well, I know
what she's like

165
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:41,998
when the two of you
are around me, but...

166
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:43,332
If you're right,

167
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,301
the tests
will come back negative.

168
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:47,502
Can you give her
a message?

169
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,038
I brought her homework...

170
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:52,140
and I love her.

171
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:09,287
Sorry I'm late.

172
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:13,391
Nick loves you.

173
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,392
House doesn't believe
you got a flat tire.

174
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,294
What does he think
I was doing?

175
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,595
Fighting with the wife.

176
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:22,565
Why would I lie about that?

177
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:25,801
She wants me to do yoga.

178
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,474
We need thinner cuts.

179
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,042
When you and Cameron
had disagreements--

180
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:36,911
I'm probably
not the best guy

181
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:38,612
<i>to go to</i>
<i>for marital advice.</i>

182
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,813
Sorry.

183
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:41,914
It's just--

184
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:43,314
Punch in
to the mitral valve.

185
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:44,615
All right,
I get the message.

186
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:47,417
No--no, I'm serious.

187
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,852
What is that?

188
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:03,295
Could be a fungus.

189
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:04,963
E.R. drew blood cultures--

190
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,031
all negative,
no parasites, no fungus.

191
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:09,099
It could be fastidious
enteric bacteria.

192
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,468
You think she's been eating
your wife's cooking?

193
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:15,137
Hey, I'm on your side, man.

194
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:16,738
I am not fighting
with my wife.

195
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,206
I had a flat tire.
It's in my trunk.

196
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:19,507
You can go look at it
if you want.

197
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,975
Don't need to.

198
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:23,576
Face tells me
you're bluffing.

199
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:25,011
Not yours--Chase's.

200
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:26,578
<i>If she was infected</i>

201
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:28,880
through the intestinal tract,
she'd have intestinal symptoms.

202
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:30,215
There are other ways
to get enteric bacteria

203
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:31,682
into the bloodstream.

204
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,183
<i>She's not</i>

205
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:34,284
<i>an intravenous drug user,</i>
<i>she has no tattoos,</i>

206
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:35,418
and she doesn't have
any scars

207
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:36,685
that would indicate
she's a cutter.

208
00:09:36,753 --> 00:09:38,187
Transesophageal echo
could give us a better idea

209
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:40,055
<i>of what we're looking at.</i>

210
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:41,289
If that valve
is about to dehisce,

211
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:42,523
echo could trigger
a heart attack.

212
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,725
So come up
with a better idea

213
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,660
or have a crash cart ready.

214
00:09:50,497 --> 00:09:52,864
Why are you
lying to house?

215
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:55,299
Chase told me.
What's the big deal?

216
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:57,267
Maybe we can talk
about this another time...

217
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:58,935
<i>or never.</i>

218
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:00,635
I really don't think
she's gonna tell anyone.

219
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:01,736
If I admit we're fighting,

220
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:03,537
he's gonna want
to know what about.

221
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:05,038
So tell him,

222
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:06,139
or tell him
it's none of his business.

223
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,774
This is easier.

224
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,142
Really? Because it seems
much harder.

225
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,643
What do I know?
I'm not a guy.

226
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,211
<i>Yes...</i>

227
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,445
If only I could be as open about
my emotional life as you are.

228
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:19,615
It's not about the yoga.

229
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:20,850
Really?
I thought it was,

230
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,317
since we spent an hour
talking about yoga,

231
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:23,918
but what do I know?
I'm not a girl.

232
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:26,019
My guess is she thinks you don't
want to spend time with her

233
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:27,254
because you're spending it
with someone else.

234
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:30,589
If she thinks I'm cheating,
she would ask.

235
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:32,224
Because
you'd tell the truth?

236
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,025
I'm not seeing
anyone else.

237
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,626
Doesn't matter.
You have a history.

238
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:37,227
And that's not her fault.

239
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:38,728
<i>So what am</i>
<i>I supposed to do?</i>

240
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:39,796
I can't prove a negative.

241
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:43,401
That is a problem.

242
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:47,038
<i>There's the heart.</i>

243
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:48,306
Valves look fine--

244
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:52,112
no vegetations,
no myxomatous changes.

245
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,717
Can you give her
a little more sedative?

246
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,024
She's dissecting.

247
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,761
She's rupturing.
Get the scope out.

248
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:01,561
Aah!

249
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:03,396
This doesn't make sense.

250
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,264
Her B.P. is normal, and
her heart rate was controlled.

251
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,566
We'll figure it out later.

252
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:09,137
We've only got about
30 seconds to get her open.

253
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:12,941
No leakage
from cannulation site.

254
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,310
Nice.

255
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:15,745
Let's see
if she'll start up.

256
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:17,449
Cardiac paddle.

257
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,655
Charging.

258
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,123
And go.

259
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:24,558
Come on.

260
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,861
Again.
Go.

261
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:29,363
Pushing five ccs
adrenaline.

262
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,966
Zap her again.

263
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:35,867
No.

264
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:43,306
It's not working.
Clear.

265
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:45,976
Clear.

266
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:51,278
Normal sinus rhythm.

267
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:53,847
Thank God.

268
00:12:04,846 --> 00:12:07,147
T.E.E. and intra-operative
visualization

269
00:12:07,215 --> 00:12:09,349
showed no vegetations
on the valves,

270
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:11,084
No structural abnormalities.

271
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:12,919
The dissection
means we were wrong

272
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:14,754
about alcohol causing
a hypertensive crisis.

273
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,355
And by "we" you mean "you."

274
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:18,456
Yeah. You were the one who
didn't have any better ideas.

275
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:20,191
It's not my fault.

276
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:21,792
I was busy
trying to judge Taub.

277
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,327
Since we already
ruled out trauma,

278
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:25,995
the dissection's probably
a genetic defect.

279
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:27,029
<i>We're running the tests.</i>

280
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:28,163
She's not marfanoid.

281
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:29,230
<i>What about an allergy?</i>

282
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:31,700
A severe enough one
could set off

283
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,835
a systemic immune reaction,

284
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:34,470
cause fluid in the lungs,

285
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:35,938
and inflammation
that could weaken the aorta.

286
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,072
If it was an allergy,

287
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,474
she'd be getting better
in the hospital,

288
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,776
not worse.
Unless it was inside her.

289
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:45,713
Meaning?

290
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,849
You want my sperm?

291
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,618
<i>We think a severe</i>
<i>allergic reaction</i>

292
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,086
could be causing
systemic breakdown.

293
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:53,487
To my son's sperm?

294
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:55,288
Actually, his semen
is more likely the problem,

295
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:58,957
which, I realize, is not
what you were reacting to.

296
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:00,157
When's the last time

297
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:01,458
the two of you
had unprotected sex?

298
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:04,761
Never.
I use a condom.

299
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:07,866
You always use a condom...
For everything?

300
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:12,772
Well, for most everything.

301
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:13,872
When?

302
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,143
The night
before she collapsed.

303
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,212
I'm placing a drop of Nick's
semen protein onto the skin.

304
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,780
Then I'll abrade it
with a needle,

305
00:13:22,848 --> 00:13:27,418
Check for a rash
in an hour or so.

306
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:29,620
Mom, come on...

307
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:31,355
we've been dating
for three years.

308
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:33,324
Look, I'm not mad,
sweetheart.

309
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:35,626
I'm just confused.

310
00:13:35,694 --> 00:13:37,128
<i>A systemic reaction</i>

311
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:39,063
can be triggered
by the protein in semen.

312
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:42,632
In most cases,
the reaction is fairly minor.

313
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,199
<i>But in rare cases,</i>

314
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,768
repeat exposure can trigger
a hypersensitivity response.

315
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:49,270
Repeat exposure?

316
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:50,804
Ugh, I know, I know--

317
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,339
Three years.

318
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:54,774
Is it supposed to hurt?

319
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:57,410
The reaction
should take longer than...

320
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:59,012
No, it's not that.
Ow.

321
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,646
Abby, what's wrong?
My stomach.

322
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:05,582
Blood in the urine.

323
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,917
<i>Aah! Aah!</i>

324
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:11,552
Aah! Aah!
Help me! Aah!

325
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,920
No allergic reaction.

326
00:14:12,987 --> 00:14:14,588
On the other hand,
now her kidneys are failing.

327
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:16,656
<i>Could be some kind</i>
<i>of neuropathy.</i>

328
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:19,125
Syphilitic
lightning pains?

329
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,693
It's not syphilis.

330
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:23,129
Vdrl and enzyme immunoassays
were negative.

331
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,498
What about a blood clot?

332
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,299
While she's on anticoagulants
from the aortic surgery?

333
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,501
Interstitial nephritis?

334
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,135
Wouldn't cause the edema
or dissection.

335
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,170
But cancer could.

336
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:35,906
Would you care to be
a little more specific?

337
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:39,209
If I could, I would have.

338
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:42,145
We could do
a full-body scan.

339
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:44,279
We hate full-body scans.

340
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:46,448
And by "we" you mean "you."

341
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:48,349
We also hate
when a patient dies

342
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:50,450
before we figure out
what's wrong with them.

343
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:57,355
Do the scan.

344
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:59,423
How can you convince someone
you're not cheating on them?

345
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:00,691
Don't cheat.

346
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,526
After a while,
they'll catch on.

347
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:04,795
What if I don't want
to wait that long?

348
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,497
Take them with you wherever
you go for 24 hours a day.

349
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,632
So your wife's
a little insecure.

350
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,467
Is that so bad?

351
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,967
At least you know
she still cares.

352
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:13,702
I know she cares.

353
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,338
What I want is for her
to be happy.

354
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:20,872
What?

355
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,975
You don't think
I want my wife to be happy?

356
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:24,479
Sure...

357
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:26,148
As long as it makes
you happy.

358
00:15:57,972 --> 00:15:59,906
What do you think?

359
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:03,242
I think
you work quickly.

360
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,576
Piece of cake--

361
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:06,211
You give them money,
they give you furniture.

362
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,980
Not bad, huh?

363
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:10,515
Nope.

364
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,318
It's not <i>bad</i> at all.

365
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,594
It's taking
a really long time.

366
00:16:25,662 --> 00:16:27,095
<i>Just hang in there</i>

367
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:29,030
<i>and try not to talk</i>
<i>unless you really have to.</i>

368
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:29,998
<i>It can affect the images.</i>

369
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:33,033
What was that?

370
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:34,802
Hello?
Are you still there?

371
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,772
I think there's something
wrong with the machine.

372
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,040
<i>It's not the machine.</i>

373
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:42,474
<i>It's an earthquake.</i>

374
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:43,842
<i>Hold on.</i>
<i>We'll get you out.</i>

375
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,344
Get me out now.

376
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:13,867
Aah!

377
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:15,936
Ugh!

378
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:20,373
Aah!

379
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,777
Oh, my God!

380
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,611
I can't hold on!

381
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:40,187
It's a black hole.

382
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:41,621
She's hallucinating.

383
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,990
I certainly hope so.

384
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,921
Hallucination
means brain problem.

385
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,657
Brain problems
don't split your aorta.

386
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:57,226
A vascular problem
could explain both.

387
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:59,662
Inflammation
in the blood-vessel walls

388
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:01,697
leads to dsection
in the aorta

389
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:03,132
and could cause
an aneurysm in the brain

390
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,433
that could cause
the visions.

391
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,301
<i>It's a bit convoluted,</i>

392
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,269
<i>but brain and heart function</i>
<i>are susceptible too.</i>

393
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:11,403
If there was any sign
of inflammation of the aorta,

394
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:13,932
that would make sense.

395
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,132
House!

396
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,499
It's not funny.

397
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:58,067
I got enough
problems already.

398
00:18:58,135 --> 00:18:59,602
Trust me.
This is gonna help.

399
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,772
An aneurysm explains
the hallucinations.

400
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,273
And it's the one thing

401
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:06,274
<i>we haven't excluded</i>
<i>from the differential.</i>

402
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:08,242
Your texting does not prove
you're faithful.

403
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,744
<i>Just proves you know</i>
<i>she thinks you're unfaithful.</i>

404
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:12,813
Can't force trust.

405
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,915
What did she hallucinate?

406
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:17,016
The content
of the hallucination

407
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,651
isn't relevant.

408
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:20,719
Not usually.
Not ever.

409
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:23,488
We know nothing.
Brain knows all.

410
00:19:23,556 --> 00:19:25,490
You get an ulcer,
you don't know it,

411
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:27,391
but the brain increases
mucin secretions.

412
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,060
<i>It knows</i>
<i>what the problem is,</i>

413
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,527
<i>knows where</i>
<i>the problem is.</i>

414
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:33,096
It's a big logical jump
from a body's immune response

415
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:35,498
to the brain giving
subconscious diagnostic clues.

416
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:37,132
What about dreaming
about waterfalls,

417
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,567
Running streams if you need
to go to the bathroom?

418
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,435
Sure. That's the same
as the brain shouting,

419
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:41,836
"you have
pancreatic cancer."

420
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:45,073
Her subconscious is trying
to tell her something.

421
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,041
We need to eavesdrop.

422
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:50,344
She was screaming she was being
sucked into a black hole,

423
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:52,246
ao we should look
for a tumor in her anus?

424
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:54,348
We need the whole story.

425
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,084
The cognitive pattern
recognition program

426
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,186
might tell us
what's going on in her head.

427
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:03,624
Or we could act
on something

428
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,192
based in science,
not science fiction.

429
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,827
<i>Get an mra with contrast</i>

430
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:08,529
<i>to see if she</i>
<i>has an aneurysm,</i>

431
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:11,131
unless you think Cuddy's
gonna go for the mind reading.

432
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:13,100
Fine.
Do the mra.

433
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,502
<i>When it comes back negative,</i>
<i>we can move on to the...</i>

434
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:19,872
crazy but possible ideas.

435
00:20:57,073 --> 00:20:58,974
What did you do
with the furniture?

436
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:01,378
I returned it.

437
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:04,150
You told me to buy it.

438
00:21:04,218 --> 00:21:06,719
But you didn't buy it.
You rented it.

439
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:12,192
You made one phone call
to Economy Furniture Supply--

440
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:14,694
"we get it done
so you don't have to."

441
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:16,729
So what?
We had a table, chairs--

442
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:19,099
But no clue
what any of it meant.

443
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:21,702
Fine.
I'll hire a decorator.

444
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,639
Perfect. Another woman
to tell you who you are.

445
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:26,107
I'll hire
a male decorator.

446
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:28,409
Step inside
one furniture store

447
00:21:28,476 --> 00:21:29,576
and find one thing
you like.

448
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:31,678
I like not doing this.

449
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:33,380
One.

450
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:44,723
<i>Abby.</i>

451
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,789
Hi.

452
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:53,090
Where's my mom?

453
00:21:53,156 --> 00:21:54,921
She went down
to get some breakfast.

454
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:56,885
How are you feeling?

455
00:21:56,953 --> 00:22:01,283
Well, besides the fact
that I can barely breathe

456
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,917
and I ache all over,

457
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:04,818
not good.

458
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:07,920
Anything I can do?

459
00:22:07,988 --> 00:22:10,889
Just don't go.

460
00:22:10,957 --> 00:22:13,563
I'm not going anywhere.

461
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,552
Been a while since
we've gone more than a day

462
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:30,719
without doing that.

463
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:31,820
I'm not going anywhere.

464
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:36,325
What'd you say?

465
00:22:36,393 --> 00:22:40,062
I've been thinking.

466
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,463
Been a long time since
we went more than a day

467
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:42,664
without doing that.

468
00:22:52,608 --> 00:22:55,877
We have a secret.

469
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,381
Now, you don't need to answer
right now, but...

470
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:07,419
Abby, I want to marry you.

471
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:15,626
Tell him the secret.
It's okay.

472
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,797
Something's wrong.

473
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:21,565
What?
Abby, what are you feeling?

474
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:22,966
I don't know.

475
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,233
Your secret
is killing you.

476
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:27,470
I see, um...
maybe it's all the medication.

477
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:30,305
I'm just--um...

478
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:36,177
Abby.
Can you hear me?

479
00:23:36,244 --> 00:23:38,412
You deserve to die.

480
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:42,649
We need four milligrams
lorazepam.

481
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,515
<i>She seized</i>
<i>for over a minute.</i>

482
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,117
Inner-ictal E.E.G.

483
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,485
showed no
synchronous discharges.

484
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:58,754
And the mra?

485
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:00,822
No aneurysms or arterial

486
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,957
or venous malformations
in the brain.

487
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,592
As predicted.

488
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:06,794
What did we say
we'd move on to?

489
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:08,729
Out-of-body experiences
can be induced

490
00:24:08,796 --> 00:24:11,130
by sensory overload
in the temporoparietal junction.

491
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:13,332
Temporoparietal junction
was clean on mri,

492
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,766
mra, and whole-body scan.

493
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,968
Which just leaves us
with the question

494
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:20,804
of what happened during
the out-of-body experience.

495
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:22,639
If I say
her blood pressure

496
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:24,440
shot up over 200
and she bit her tongue,

497
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:26,976
would that be
a satisfactory answer?

498
00:24:27,043 --> 00:24:29,745
Sure. If you then went on
to answer the following--

499
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:32,280
did she float above her body?
Did she see jesus?

500
00:24:32,348 --> 00:24:33,515
<i>Did she bathe</i>
<i>in the Ganges?</i>

501
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,417
No, no, and no.

502
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:37,152
Can we get back
to the medical science?

503
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,554
No.

504
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:40,322
She claims she emerged
from her body

505
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,757
as a younger version of herself
and started talking.

506
00:24:42,825 --> 00:24:44,960
She couldn't remember
what was discussed.

507
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:47,395
<i>But I'm sure</i>
<i>it wasn't a differential.</i>

508
00:24:47,463 --> 00:24:48,730
House, cognitive
pattern recognition

509
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:51,366
is 50 years from being
a useful diagnostic tool.

510
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:53,368
<i>Even if we can</i>
<i>get the equipment,</i>

511
00:24:53,436 --> 00:24:54,669
it takes hours
for the initial mapping.

512
00:24:54,737 --> 00:24:56,203
If she has another seizure,
she could stroke out.

513
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:57,571
Coincidentally,

514
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:59,439
she could also have a stroke
if we do nothing.

515
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:01,308
I'm not telling a mother
who's scared out of her mind

516
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,743
that our best shot
is a magic trick.

517
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:05,812
It's not magical.
It's experimental.

518
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,148
Just like washing your hands
after pooping once was.

519
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,850
And technically,
it's not our best shot.

520
00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:15,221
I'm pretty sure
it's our only shot.

521
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:16,355
Perfect.

522
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:18,489
So, Foreman,
go get her consent.

523
00:25:18,557 --> 00:25:20,958
<i>The rest of you go down</i>
<i>to the cog sci lab.</i>

524
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:22,860
Equipment
should already be there.

525
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:35,073
I'll catch up.

526
00:25:39,645 --> 00:25:41,579
Thanks for the invite.

527
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:43,648
I'm not sure I'm up
for the hospital food.

528
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:45,883
Good, 'cause I wasn't
planning on lunch.

529
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,987
While you watch video clips,

530
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:52,856
a computer maps how your brain
processes the images.

531
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:54,759
How long
will it take?

532
00:25:54,826 --> 00:25:57,394
Six hours. But that's
really just the prep.

533
00:25:57,462 --> 00:26:00,696
Once the computer maps how
she processes the information,

534
00:26:00,764 --> 00:26:02,197
we'll put her
under twilight sedation,

535
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:03,632
use the same equipment

536
00:26:03,699 --> 00:26:05,734
to monitor her
unconscious thoughts.

537
00:26:05,801 --> 00:26:07,868
Hopefully, it'll spit out
a very basic video

538
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:09,637
of whatever's
going on in her head.

539
00:26:09,705 --> 00:26:11,105
And what will
that tell you?

540
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:13,274
Hopefully,
it'll give us a clue

541
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:15,409
as to where your brain
thinks the problem is.

542
00:26:15,476 --> 00:26:16,943
A lot of "hopefullys."

543
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:18,612
Could it hurt her?

544
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,714
We're at
a diagnostic dead end.

545
00:26:21,782 --> 00:26:23,315
We've got to try
something.

546
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,558
This is much better
than lunch.

547
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,628
I agree.

548
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:41,633
What made you
think of this?

549
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,735
I missed you.

550
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:44,969
No, I-I mean this--

551
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:48,039
car, in the parking lot.

552
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,241
I just don't like feeling

553
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,242
like maybe this isn't
the first time you've done this.

554
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,011
It's the first.

555
00:26:54,078 --> 00:26:56,380
I love you.
You know that, right?

556
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:59,885
Yes.

557
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:03,289
I want you to be able
to trust me.

558
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:07,494
And I want to, but--

559
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:16,271
Inspiration point doesn't open
till after dark.

560
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:19,174
<i>Got a real cool magic show</i>
<i>about to start.</i>

561
00:27:21,945 --> 00:27:24,680
Also, I'm gonna need
to check your spare.

562
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:52,910
Abby, can you think
of something specific?

563
00:27:52,977 --> 00:27:54,209
Like what?

564
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:57,277
Doesn't matter.
Just make it a single image.

565
00:28:14,624 --> 00:28:16,192
What are you thinking?

566
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,227
About Nick
playing baseball.

567
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:20,328
Holy crap.

568
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:22,363
<i>That's amazing.</i>

569
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:23,864
Yeah.
Now all we have to do

570
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,432
is read her subconscious

571
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,434
and hope that
it's completely rational

572
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:31,203
<i>and went to med school.</i>

573
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:34,038
Does anything
get you excited?

574
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,471
Can I help you
with something?

575
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:45,174
Yes. Uh, I was wondering
if you could tell me

576
00:28:45,242 --> 00:28:46,742
a little bit
about this dining table.

577
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,645
It's made of wood,
and you eat off it.

578
00:28:50,713 --> 00:28:52,180
So you're paid
by commission?

579
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:53,247
It's furniture.

580
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,948
Find something you like.
Let me know.

581
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:56,851
I'll ring it up.

582
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,754
Thank you so much.

583
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:31,625
Okay, that's--
that's not the one.

584
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:38,571
That is
a remarkable collection,

585
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:40,274
if I can show it to you.

586
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:43,076
I'm Gabriella.

587
00:29:43,144 --> 00:29:45,611
I'm really just looking
for a nice dining-room table.

588
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,981
I see.
You're daring.

589
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:50,951
Yes, I do that
sometimes,

590
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,486
but...

591
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:54,421
Right now
why am I daring?

592
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:56,623
You're not
constrained by rules.

593
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:59,058
What else attracts you
in the patio section?

594
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:02,194
Wait, this
is a patio tab--

595
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:03,295
For outside?

596
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:23,615
Well, it's taken us
just over an hour

597
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:25,716
to prove that she has
a very boring subconscious.

598
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:29,553
Anyone ever tell you
you can be a real buzzkill?

599
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,690
Yes.

600
00:30:32,757 --> 00:30:34,358
Stars?

601
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:37,193
<i>Maybe that's a stripe?</i>

602
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:39,361
It's the sky.

603
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:41,530
<i>She's thinking</i>
<i>about the moon</i>

604
00:30:41,598 --> 00:30:43,434
<i>and the stars</i>
<i>and the sky.</i>

605
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:45,271
She's going to Stanford
to study physics.

606
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:47,806
It's not a big revelation
that she'd think about the sky.

607
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:50,841
Or star could be
a white blood cell.

608
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:52,509
<i>Leukemia?</i>

609
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,447
Who's that?

610
00:30:58,514 --> 00:31:00,414
<i>Her dad?</i>

611
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:01,615
He died
when she was eight.

612
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:03,349
What did daddy die of?

613
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,818
Um, private-plane crash--
no connection.

614
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:09,489
Stars, moon, sky,

615
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:11,791
qhite blood cells,
heart valves,

616
00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:13,426
<i>black holes, or anus</i>

617
00:31:13,493 --> 00:31:15,995
<i>or a million other circular</i>
<i>passageways into the body</i>

618
00:31:16,062 --> 00:31:17,663
and her dad.

619
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:18,898
What do you think
it means?

620
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:21,667
She likes school,

621
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:23,735
and she has daddy issues--

622
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:26,671
<i>Neither of which</i>
<i>helps us.</i>

623
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:33,141
So now what do we do?
Start over?

624
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:34,642
We obviously
missed something.

625
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,744
What about the liver?

626
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,844
What about her left toe?

627
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:39,779
Oh, sorry.

628
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:41,881
I thought we were randomly
picking out body parts

629
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:43,649
that had nothing to do
with her symptoms.

630
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:45,684
Liver's responsible
for proteins,

631
00:31:45,752 --> 00:31:48,186
immunological effects,
production of red blood cells.

632
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:50,588
Might be able
to explain the lungs,

633
00:31:50,656 --> 00:31:51,656
the hallucinations.

634
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:53,390
Not the aortic dissection.

635
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:56,526
<i>Kidneys are also failing.</i>

636
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:59,795
We add in polycystic disease,
could explain the dissection.

637
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:01,629
So that's one
imperfect theory,

638
00:32:01,697 --> 00:32:03,230
plus a rare complication

639
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:04,531
<i>of a second theory,</i>

640
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:07,467
<i>which gives us</i>
<i>a complete explanation.</i>

641
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:10,902
Don't polish
the notion, Foreman.

642
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,906
Pineal gland
is calcified.

643
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,241
<i>It'supposed to be</i>
<i>calcified.</i>

644
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,343
Happens after puberty.

645
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,311
What if
it's obscuring a tumor?

646
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:22,413
It's the only place
we couldn't look inside.

647
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:24,347
Get a better look
at her pineal gland

648
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:27,449
with three tesla
fast spin echo mri.

649
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:36,694
You're pacing my office
'cause you're buying furniture?

650
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:38,262
No, I'm pacing
your office

651
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,431
because I'm physically incapable
of buying furniture.

652
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:42,499
For Amber's old place?

653
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,902
Yeah.

654
00:32:44,969 --> 00:32:46,737
Uh, it needs some new--

655
00:32:46,804 --> 00:32:48,205
I know you bought
the place I wanted.

656
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:49,439
You're a jerk.
Let's move on.

657
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:50,473
Hire a decorator.

658
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:53,809
I'm supposed to find me.

659
00:32:53,877 --> 00:32:55,711
Backpack through Europe.

660
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:58,079
<i>I know it's hard to believe,</i>

661
00:32:58,147 --> 00:32:59,313
but you know what says
even more

662
00:32:59,381 --> 00:33:00,514
about who you are
than your furniture?

663
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:02,716
<i>The fact that you are</i>
<i>letting House</i>

664
00:33:02,784 --> 00:33:05,451
tell you how
to buy furniture.

665
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,519
Call Beatrice.

666
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,966
Mri revealed
no remarkable features

667
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:23,200
on her pineal gland.

668
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,001
But there were slightly
elevated levels

669
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,969
of lactate dehydrogenase
isoenzymes.

670
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:29,237
Which we would expect to see

671
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:31,439
if there was an allergic
reaction happening.

672
00:33:31,507 --> 00:33:32,840
There's definitely
no allergy.

673
00:33:32,908 --> 00:33:35,576
Parasite?

674
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:36,809
There's this
middle eastern parasite--

675
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:39,811
How exactly do you
want to be shot down?

676
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:41,512
<i>On the basis of the fact</i>

677
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,181
that she's never been within
6,000 miles of the middle east,

678
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:46,249
or on the basis of the fact
that all our scans

679
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:48,351
<i>and urine samples</i>
<i>came back clean?</i>

680
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:51,820
And yet
she's still failing,

681
00:33:51,888 --> 00:33:54,755
<i>system after system.</i>

682
00:33:57,057 --> 00:33:59,891
So either we find
the answer at autopsy

683
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,126
or...

684
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,563
What?

685
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,566
I got nothin'.

686
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:50,962
I was gonna head out.

687
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,231
If there's any change,
I assume you'll page me?

688
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:56,667
Are you having an affair?

689
00:34:59,103 --> 00:35:01,337
Does it bother you
that your wife

690
00:35:01,404 --> 00:35:03,072
doesn't have the guts
to actually ask that question,

691
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,106
and I do?

692
00:35:04,174 --> 00:35:06,308
On both ends, yes.

693
00:35:06,376 --> 00:35:09,110
Difference is,
I'm not afraid of the answer.

694
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:10,445
And I might believe you.

695
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:12,046
I'm not having an affair.

696
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:13,180
But you want to.

697
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:14,748
No, I don't.

698
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,583
I'm through
living like that.

699
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:18,618
<i>Why?</i>

700
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:20,052
What, you finally got
to the point

701
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,888
where half your age plus seven
just isn't young enough?

702
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,623
Talk to you later,
House.

703
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:29,227
Or is it because you now really
are old enough to be their--

704
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:35,666
the dad.

705
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,534
Does he travel for work?

706
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,602
What do you mean,
"does he"?

707
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,838
He died
almost ten years ago.

708
00:35:42,906 --> 00:35:46,675
Not hers,
her boyfriend's.

709
00:35:46,742 --> 00:35:49,443
He's the one in her visions.

710
00:35:53,814 --> 00:35:56,949
I'm your son's
girlfriend's doctor.

711
00:35:57,017 --> 00:35:59,451
Oh.
<i>It's a mouthful,</i>

712
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,853
But probably not
as tricky as your title.

713
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:04,655
Um, okay.
Is Abby gonna be all right?

714
00:36:04,723 --> 00:36:06,056
Do you travel a lot?

715
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,158
Yeah, I have
a food-import business. Why?

716
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:09,192
Where'd you go?

717
00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:10,626
All over--

718
00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:12,928
France, Italy,
the mediterranean. Why?

719
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:15,797
I think you exposed her
to a parasite.

720
00:36:15,865 --> 00:36:18,232
Oh.

721
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,133
I thought the scans
didn't show any.

722
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:21,635
Because she
doesn't have any.

723
00:36:21,703 --> 00:36:23,870
But you just said--
it's cool.

724
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:26,939
My theory is that her body

725
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:28,874
was able to kill off
the parasite,

726
00:36:28,942 --> 00:36:30,575
but what it couldn't do

727
00:36:30,643 --> 00:36:32,443
was get rid
of the shell,

728
00:36:32,511 --> 00:36:34,378
which doesn't show up
on the scans.

729
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:37,580
That little piece
of microscopic garbage

730
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:39,315
set off
an allergic reaction

731
00:36:39,383 --> 00:36:41,951
called cerebellar
schistosomiasis

732
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:44,186
Delayed
hypersensitivity allergy,

733
00:36:44,254 --> 00:36:47,623
or cusdehaaa.

734
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:50,092
Risky, unpleasant treatment,
but completely curable.

735
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,294
Well, that's fantastic.

736
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:53,696
You'd think so,
wouldn't you?

737
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:55,263
Only thing is,

738
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:58,666
did you ever have sex
with your son's girlfriend?

739
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:02,469
Where the hell do you
get off asking--

740
00:37:02,537 --> 00:37:04,772
Shut up.

741
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:09,042
See, I can't treat this
unless I can confirm it,

742
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,844
<i>and the only way</i>
<i>she could have been exposed</i>

743
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:12,279
<i>to this parasite</i>
<i>is sexually,</i>

744
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:14,247
which means
she's gonna die very soon

745
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,749
unless you admit
that you slept with her.

746
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:21,021
Dad?

747
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:22,355
What's going on?

748
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:23,823
Gee, this is bad,

749
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:26,526
because you now have to choose
between her living

750
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:28,461
and the truth
becoming public.

751
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:30,697
And frankly,
given what the truth is,

752
00:37:30,764 --> 00:37:33,132
it's a tough call.

753
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,571
You'd broken up.

754
00:37:38,638 --> 00:37:40,139
She was crying.

755
00:37:40,206 --> 00:37:43,042
Your girlfriend is not
allergic to your semen.

756
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:44,910
She's allergic
to the Egyptian parasite

757
00:37:44,978 --> 00:37:46,712
swimming around
in your dad's semen.

758
00:37:50,616 --> 00:37:52,149
You slept with Abby?

759
00:37:52,217 --> 00:37:54,685
I was drunk.

760
00:37:54,753 --> 00:37:55,953
We both...

761
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,654
No need to explain.
Technically, she was legal.

762
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:04,463
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Wait!

763
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,997
<i>Hey...</i>

764
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:07,732
All things considered,

765
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,434
it's actually great news.

766
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,884
So what do you think?

767
00:38:26,952 --> 00:38:29,620
You wussed out,
and you used a decorator.

768
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:31,488
Why can't that be me--

769
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:32,789
<i>The wuss</i>
<i>who loves decorators?</i>

770
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:34,023
'cause it's not.

771
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:35,792
Okay. It's not.

772
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:38,027
But don't return it.
I can't keep doing this.

773
00:38:38,095 --> 00:38:39,862
You have to.

774
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,366
You can't keep letting
other people define you.

775
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:48,271
Not another elephant.

776
00:39:04,388 --> 00:39:05,555
Decorator
didn't pick this.

777
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:08,024
You're gonna have to buy
your own cape.

778
00:39:23,106 --> 00:39:30,813
??? ???

779
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:34,916
I like what this says
about you, Wilson.

780
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:53,633
??? ???

781
00:40:14,388 --> 00:40:20,292
??? we skipped
the light fandango ???

782
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:27,066
??? turned cartwheels
'cross the floor ???

783
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:33,940
??? I was feeling
kind of seasick ???

784
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:40,010
??? the crowd called out
for more ???

785
00:40:40,077 --> 00:40:46,014
??? the room
was humming harder ???

786
00:40:46,082 --> 00:40:50,151
??? as the ceiling
flew away... ???

787
00:40:53,522 --> 00:40:55,055
I don't remember him
at the wedding.

788
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:56,624
Do you?

789
00:40:56,691 --> 00:40:59,526
I don't remember most of the
people who were at our wedding.

790
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:05,298
Which is why...

791
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:08,300
I thought I'd ask
the love of my life

792
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:11,136
to marry me.

793
00:41:11,204 --> 00:41:14,672
We're already married.

794
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,741
I want to be better at it.

795
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,980
Oh, it's beautiful.

796
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:26,982
??? turned a whiter ???

797
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,151
??? shade of pale ???

798
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:37,991
??? ???

799
00:41:51,403 --> 00:41:53,604
What'd you tell him?

800
00:41:53,671 --> 00:41:55,839
That it doesn't mean
she doesn't love him.

801
00:41:55,907 --> 00:41:58,107
And he bought it?

802
00:41:58,175 --> 00:42:00,576
It's true.

803
00:42:05,615 --> 00:42:07,715
Your wife say yes?

804
00:42:07,783 --> 00:42:09,750
How did you know--

805
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,586
Monkey see, monkey do.

806
00:42:12,654 --> 00:42:15,622
At least he has
the young and stupid excuse.

807
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,391
She said yes.

808
00:42:20,527 --> 00:42:22,628
Good for you.

809
00:42:22,695 --> 00:42:27,598
Thank you.
??? that her face
at first just ghostly ???

810
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:30,467
??? turned a whiter ???

811
00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:34,604
??? shade of pale ???
