1
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:36,579
A crane collapsed
in downtown Trenton.

2
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,211
Don't care.

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,205
That's my great-grandfather.

4
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:47,038
No, it's just a book he wrote.

5
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:49,070
Open it up.

6
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:55,039
Seriously, you're giving
this to <i>us?</i>

7
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:56,671
<i>It's a big step you're taking.</i>

8
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,001
I wanted to congratulate you.

9
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:00,499
I understand that's
the adult thing to do.

10
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:01,767
How did you know?

11
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,134
I've known for a while.

12
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:05,569
The fact that you
decided to cohabitate

13
00:01:05,637 --> 00:01:07,671
is not exactly a spoiler.

14
00:01:07,738 --> 00:01:10,073
Unless my intel is wrong.

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,674
Trouble in paradise?

16
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:14,309
We have to get to Trenton.

17
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,280
House S6E21
Help Me

18
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,290
Sub: Floydian
www.bierdopje.com

19
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:49,337
Can you hear me?

20
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:50,569
Hmm?

21
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,770
That sound like a yes?

22
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:55,106
Sir, we have to get you to the O.R.

23
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:56,773
<i>You have a bad wound,
but we're gonna pack it</i>

24
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:58,675
and transport you
as fast as we can.

25
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,377
Skull fracture.
Glasgow coma score of 11.

26
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:05,478
She's immediate.

27
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:06,946
<i>Move on.</i>

28
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:08,847
This guy's dead.
His wounds aren't so--

29
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:10,281
forget the wound. Look at his toes.

30
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:14,349
Atherosclerotic emboli.
He'll never survive the surgery.

31
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:16,584
Maybe his shoes were too tight.

32
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:18,485
It's not the shoes.
Skin shows smoker's facies.

33
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:21,254
He's not gonna make
it till morning.

34
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:22,888
He'll just take up
an ambulance ride,

35
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:25,257
surgeon's time, and an icu bed.

36
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:28,758
He's expectant. Leave him.

37
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:31,925
I only nodded off for a second.

38
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:34,591
I lost control of the load.
I'm so sorry.

39
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:36,459
Don't worry. We're gonna
get you outta here.

40
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:38,060
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,294
He's secure.

42
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:40,394
Ready? Three, two, one.

43
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,698
That's it.

44
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:47,932
Crane operator.
Made it through amazingly well.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,034
Lucid and responsive.
Stable fracture, right humerus.

46
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,435
Haven't gotten to
his lower half yet.

47
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:55,436
Tell me when something hurts.

48
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,937
I fell asleep.
Killed all those people.

49
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:01,240
Something other than
your conscience.

50
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,874
Is that a pill in your pocket,

51
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,475
<i>or are you just happy to have</i>

52
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:07,877
a tiny pill-shaped penis?

53
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:09,444
Caffeine pills.

54
00:04:09,512 --> 00:04:11,112
You fell asleep taking these?

55
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,213
I drank two cups of coffee too.

56
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:15,014
Is that normal for you?

57
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:16,915
No, I hate coffee.
I'm working on no sleep.

58
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,350
My daughter has the flu.

59
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:20,351
This much caffeine
for a coffee virgin.

60
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:23,420
There's no way he fell asleep.
He passed out.

61
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:25,588
<i>Which means a neurological
disorder</i>

62
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:27,190
caused the crash, not fatigue.

63
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:30,125
Hey.

64
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:32,828
We're taking the crane
operator back to Princeton.

65
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,763
They said he was barely hurt-
-he can wait.

66
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,164
Steal an ambulance.
And call the team.

67
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:37,499
Tell 'em we got a case.

68
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:40,568
House. No! I need you here.

69
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:43,404
And he needs me there.
And he moans louder than you do.

70
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:45,172
There were over 100
people in that building.

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,840
Only 76 have been accounted for.

72
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:51,143
Foreman and your team can handle
the crane operator for now.

73
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:12,858
Having fun down there?

74
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:14,092
<i>Lots!</i>

75
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,894
Every time Cuddy
leans over a patient,

76
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:20,330
it's another opportunity
for a down blouse nip slip.

77
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:22,767
What's going on
between her and Lucas?

78
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:24,035
Besides them moving in together?

79
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:25,370
That's not enough for you?

80
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:28,473
I gave her the
housewarming gift earlier.

81
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,975
And she paused for a split second,

82
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:33,044
like she was hiding something.

83
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:34,479
<i>It's probably her moral
revulsion</i>

84
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:35,847
at housewarming gifts.

85
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:37,850
Or maybe she didn't
want to accept a gift

86
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,518
for something she wasn't gonna do.

87
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:43,486
<i>You actually think they're not
moving in together?</i>

88
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,587
What was that? You okay?

89
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:49,357
Yep. Vending machine collapsed.

90
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:52,093
She still using your
ex-wife as a realtor?

91
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,660
<i>As far as I know.</i>

92
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,029
<i>Well, know a little farther,
will you?</i>

93
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:57,165
<i>Look into it.</i>

94
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,959
Hey!

95
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:34,128
There's somebody down here!

96
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,065
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

97
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,100
tap three times, or call out.

98
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,138
Is anyone there?

99
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:51,108
I'm not getting anything.

100
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:53,443
I heard something-
-there's gotta be a void down there.

101
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:54,544
<i>There's a million voids down there.</i>

102
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:56,212
It was the parking garage.

103
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,813
But equipment hasn't
picked up any movement.

104
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:59,248
Dogs haven't picked up any scent.

105
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:00,582
There's smashed cars down there.

106
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,451
The gasoline throw off their scent?

107
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,919
Look, we gotta get
back to work, okay?

108
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:07,654
We'll get to this area soon.
Excuse me.

109
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:06,142
Anybody hear me?

110
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,146
Hey!

111
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:12,548
Anybody hear me?

112
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:08,100
Aah! Oh...

113
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:14,941
Help me.

114
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:24,992
What's your name?

115
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:33,099
Please...my husband's gift.

116
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:35,868
I was supposed to pick
it up at the framers.

117
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:37,636
It's on Elm.

118
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,170
Well, you should
have told me earlier.

119
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:40,605
I could have picked
it up on the way.

120
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:43,107
What's your name?

121
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:44,375
It's a picture from
our Tortola trip.

122
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:45,843
For his birthday.

123
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,278
I'm not asking your name
because I wanna become friends.

124
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:51,714
I'm trying to gauge
your mental state.

125
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:53,382
Hanna.

126
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,485
Okay, that's a start.
What day of the week is it?

127
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:57,685
Tuesday.

128
00:09:57,753 --> 00:09:59,887
Better still.

129
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,522
What happened?

130
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:05,226
You know that giant
construction crane next door?

131
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:08,362
It's kind of on top
of you right now.

132
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,031
Okay, I'm gonna try
to pull you out.

133
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:13,599
Ow! My leg!

134
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,634
Oh! Oh! Oh!

135
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:20,706
Okay, okay.

136
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:22,641
Whew...

137
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,509
I'm gonna need to get help.

138
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:26,277
No, stay! Someone else will come.

139
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:28,845
No one knows I'm down here.

140
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:30,981
Please! Stay with me.

141
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,416
Don't leave me in the dark.

142
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:35,251
I'll be right back.

143
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:37,019
No! Don't leave me in the dark!

144
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:39,588
Please stay!

145
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:44,925
He's still in the E.R., House.

146
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:46,627
We haven't had time to
start a differential.

147
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:48,262
Perfect! Let's start right now.

148
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,663
Put me on speaker.

149
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:53,766
What causes syncope?

150
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:55,835
Your guy's stable.
The two dozen other patients--

151
00:10:55,903 --> 00:10:57,102
<i>don't need to be diagnosed.</i>

152
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,936
They just need to be bandaged.

153
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:01,973
What causes syncope?

154
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,108
Vasovagal reaction...

155
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,280
Meningioma. Sick sinus syndrome.

156
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:07,185
<i>Or you're wrong, and he just fell asleep.</i>

157
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:08,420
How's he gonna sleep

158
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:10,588
with 50 cups of coffee
going through his veins?

159
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:11,723
Were you never a medical resident?

160
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,925
I hear ten, eleven, and twelve.

161
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:15,394
Where's Thirteen? <i>She's not here.</i>

162
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:17,294
And the answer to your
next question is no.

163
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:18,727
I don't know where she is.

164
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,628
Do you have the answer to
my question after that?

165
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:23,398
<i>Space-occupying lesion in his brain
is most likely.</i>

166
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:24,932
Mri will prove I'm right.

167
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,133
Or it'll just prove

168
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:27,600
he suffered head
trauma from the crash.

169
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,135
<i>Which we'd wanna find anyway.</i>

170
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:32,169
Two birds with one scan. Do it.

171
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:34,836
Having trouble finding
a vein for Hanna's iv.

172
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,305
She getting weaker?

173
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:38,073
Paler? No, no. She's stable.

174
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:39,442
That means her blood
loss in minimal.

175
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,877
Buys us some time.

176
00:11:40,944 --> 00:11:42,311
Get the iv into her tibia.

177
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:45,447
It's almost hollow,
feeds into the venous system.

178
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:50,719
Which they obviously don't
teach you in emt school.

179
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:02,295
This side's still
leaning pretty bad.

180
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:03,596
Gotta shore up this beam.

181
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,533
Told ya I'd be back.

182
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,368
<i>...On my side.</i>

183
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:10,601
Heard you might be thirsty.

184
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:13,137
Ah...

185
00:12:13,204 --> 00:12:15,372
I assume that bodes
well for the rescue?

186
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,073
Structural beam.
High compression concrete.

187
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:18,408
I can't break it up.

188
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:19,876
You can't get me outta here?

189
00:12:19,944 --> 00:12:21,710
<i>Naw. Just means we gotta
move on</i>

190
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:23,178
to a different piece of equipment.

191
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:25,313
I got airbags comin' in
that'll lift 70 tons.

192
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:29,283
What's your name?

193
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:31,117
You testing my mental state?

194
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,818
<i>I'm gonna be stuck down here
for a while.</i>

195
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,153
I'd like somebody to talk to.

196
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,521
Look, the guy who
just left is the one

197
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,322
who's gonna be holding
your hand through all this.

198
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,690
You talk to him.

199
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:41,191
Little pinch.

200
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:43,025
Aah! Oh! Ow!

201
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,996
<i>Oh...</i> Okay. Big pinch.

202
00:12:48,064 --> 00:12:50,265
I gotta call my husband.

203
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,900
Can I use your phone?

204
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:53,201
Uh, no bars down here.

205
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,737
<i>L'chaim.</i>

206
00:12:56,804 --> 00:12:59,239
Where are you going? Don't worry.

207
00:12:59,306 --> 00:13:02,208
Fire marshal bill
will be back soon.

208
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:13,549
<i>So I hope I didn't weird
you out</i>

209
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:15,016
giving you that gift.

210
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,283
Can we talk about this later?

211
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:18,118
<i>Of course.</i>

212
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:21,521
Is now later?

213
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:23,257
Maybe things aren't going
so well with Lucas.

214
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:24,558
If so, I'm sorry.

215
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:26,126
I didn't mean to
step into anything.

216
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:28,528
There's no problems.
We're doing just great.

217
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:29,896
Thank you.

218
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:31,397
So why the weirdness?

219
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,301
Can you help?

220
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:39,535
When I opened it,

221
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:42,804
I didn't think it was
a housewarming gift.

222
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:45,672
I thought it was an
engagement present.

223
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,511
It just happened last night.

224
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:57,880
No wonder you wanna
hide this from me...

225
00:13:57,947 --> 00:13:59,781
Since I'm such a delicate flower.

226
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:01,782
I didn't know what to say.

227
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,450
And I've been slightly distracted.

228
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:04,751
That might make sense,

229
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:06,119
'cept you're not wearing the ring.

230
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:08,187
So...You are hiding it,

231
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,223
which begs the question--

232
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,657
House...It's in my office drawer

233
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,959
because I knew I was coming here.

234
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:16,593
It's not weird.

235
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,328
There's no mystery.

236
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:22,929
I'm just getting married.

237
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:25,164
'Scuse me.

238
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,500
How much longer?

239
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,700
Uh, less than a minute.

240
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,733
Are you in any pain?

241
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:34,669
Nothing now. Just a
little claustrophobic.

242
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:37,137
<i>Shouldn't you be taking care</i>
<i>of those other people,</i>

243
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:39,339
the ones that I hurt?

244
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:45,006
<i>Everything checks out okay.</i>

245
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:52,443
My nose is bleeding.

246
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:55,244
It's expected, given the
trauma you've sustained.

247
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,713
That's <i>not</i> expected.

248
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:08,651
The way things fell,
this support beam

249
00:15:08,718 --> 00:15:10,252
is now holding up a
giant pile of rubble.

250
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,887
We can't lift it without
jeopardizing everyone down here.

251
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:16,125
So it's time to discuss amputation.

252
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:24,636
No.

253
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,070
Please listen to me.

254
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:28,573
We've been down here
almost two hours.

255
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,643
<i>By the time they clear away the rubble-
-</i>

256
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,048
we are not cutting off her leg.

257
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:34,715
You don't have to rush through this

258
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:37,384
to make his job easier.

259
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:39,352
You kidding me?

260
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:41,319
We leave the leg pinned,
we're risking crush syndrome.

261
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:43,720
<i>What's that?</i>

262
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:45,221
Your leg isn't getting
enough circulation.

263
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:47,189
The longer it's pinned
the more the muscle dies.

264
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:48,756
So what does that mean,
like a limp?

265
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,825
<i>Dying muscles release poisons.</i>

266
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:52,760
We free your leg,

267
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,295
<i>the poisons rush back into your system.</i>

268
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:57,133
It could stop your heart.
So could cheeseburgers.

269
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:59,669
Let's get your lazy friends
to start moving that pile.

270
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:01,472
She's got two more hours
before crush syndrome

271
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,074
could possibly set in.

272
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:04,808
<i>We're digging up there by hand.</i>

273
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:07,078
I can't guarantee I can
get 10 tons of debris

274
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:09,480
<i>pulled off in two hours.
</i> Well, you need to try.

275
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:11,980
It's my leg.

276
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:13,948
<i>It's not just crush syndrome you
gotta worry about, okay?</i>

277
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,682
There's gas leaks. There's fire.

278
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,584
We can never rule out
secondary collapses,

279
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:19,018
<i>no matter how much we shore
this thing up.</i>

280
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:20,553
You think chopping
off someone's limb

281
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:22,388
inside a pile of
dirty rocks is safe?

282
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:23,956
Sepsis, fat embolism, a hemorrhage.

283
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,757
Those risks are nothing
compared to the risk

284
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:27,892
of this thing coming down again.

285
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,393
<i>Captain, he's a jerk.</i>

286
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:30,961
But it's what the patient wants.

287
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,496
<i>Can we please</i>

288
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:35,165
just give it a couple more hours?

289
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:40,769
Yeah.

290
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:42,204
I gotta get up to triage.

291
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:49,443
Thank you, doctor.

292
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:51,144
House.

293
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:54,180
You don't need to thank me.

294
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,415
Just makes sense.

295
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,951
Just promise me you won't
let them cut off my leg.

296
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,119
I promise.

297
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,355
Does that make you feel better?

298
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,489
For some reason, it does.

299
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:10,661
Your phone is working down here.

300
00:17:10,728 --> 00:17:12,863
Switched carriers.
Better rollover minutes.

301
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,097
Talk.

302
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:15,798
Mri was clean, but afterwards,

303
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,800
he started bleeding out
of his eyes and nose.

304
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,068
So there was something
wrong before the collapse.

305
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:22,804
Unless it's just conjunctive
coagulopathy from the trauma.

306
00:17:22,872 --> 00:17:24,939
Yeah, yeah, yeah--you don't
think he was sick before.

307
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:26,407
<i>We get it! You're wrong.</i>

308
00:17:26,474 --> 00:17:27,474
Brain infection?

309
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,376
Sorry I'm late.

310
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,511
Where were you? <i>Physical therapy.</i>

311
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,279
I left my phone in my locker.

312
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:35,482
<i>The infection causes neurological symptoms,</i>

313
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,118
goes systemic, and D.I.
C. xauses the bleed.

314
00:17:37,185 --> 00:17:38,420
<i>Good theory.</i>

315
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:39,955
Except for the part
that there's no fever.

316
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:41,856
<i>Get an X-ray venogram.</i>

317
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:43,791
See if you can find a
reason for your existence.

318
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:45,960
<i>Also look for venous sinus thrombosis.</i>

319
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:47,561
Would have seen it on the mri.

320
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,530
Not if you were too
busy not looking for it.

321
00:17:49,597 --> 00:17:51,798
We should X-ray for a
facial fracture first.

322
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,267
This could all be simple trauma.

323
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:54,768
Just do what I tell you.

324
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:56,903
<i>Be back in ten minutes.</i>

325
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:59,572
You're leaving?

326
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,407
There's a dozen people
here who can save you.

327
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:04,243
I'm apparently the only one
who can save this other guy.

328
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,645
W-wait!

329
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:08,146
Don't go.

330
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,622
Hanna's freaking out.

331
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:20,456
She's having a panic attack.

332
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:22,625
She can't breathe.
She's gonna rip out all her ivs.

333
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:23,993
So calm her down.

334
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,661
She wants you.

335
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,096
I'm flattered. Give her oxygen.

336
00:18:28,164 --> 00:18:30,635
They won't let o2 down there.

337
00:18:30,702 --> 00:18:32,670
Fear of explosion.

338
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,571
You have to go back.

339
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:36,273
She needs you, House.

340
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:54,169
You only came back
because I freaked out.

341
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:56,436
Right?

342
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:57,870
Oh, no.

343
00:18:57,938 --> 00:18:59,405
I just realized how...

344
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,675
Big and scary the world is

345
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:06,645
and how cozy and safe
this little place is.

346
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,548
<i>Thank you.</i>

347
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:10,618
I'm sorry I needed you.

348
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:20,828
Here. Call your husband.

349
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:33,072
Charlie?

350
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,742
<i>I'm here in...</i>

351
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,344
<i>They called you?</i>

352
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:41,914
They're helping me.

353
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:46,118
<i>Are you coming?</i>

354
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,888
I don't know how this could happen.

355
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,823
<i>It's your birthday.
I'm so sorry.</i>

356
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,925
See? This is why I
lied about the phone.

357
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,327
Your bp is spiking,

358
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,862
so you're bleeding faster
from your leg wound.

359
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,563
I'm gonna have less
time to save it.

360
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,898
<i>Hang up.</i>

361
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,802
Okay. Okay, they're
telling me I have to go.

362
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,474
That was stupid of me.

363
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,310
It was nice.

364
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,514
I don't see that
as a contradiction.

365
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,117
He was already on his way.

366
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,752
He was in Baltimore,

367
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,389
and they all saw it on the news.

368
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,158
How many people were hurt?

369
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:30,096
What did I tell you about not
raising your blood pressure?

370
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,702
Can I ask what's
wrong with your leg?

371
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,170
Crane fell on it.

372
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:39,872
Small world.

373
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,607
You could have just said no.

374
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:46,610
I'll remember that for
my next human contact.

375
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:51,215
Would you pray with me?

376
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,917
No.

377
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,854
<i>I'm not in the habit</i>
<i>of encouraging</i>

378
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,357
my patients' superstitions.

379
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,025
How is that a habit?

380
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:04,128
You plan on getting trapped
under a building again?

381
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,631
I don't believe in God.

382
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,434
I don't either.

383
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,938
Please?

384
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,823
I always thought...

385
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:32,725
<i>If I did the right thing,</i>

386
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,928
if I treated people right,

387
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:38,999
then good things
would happen to me.

388
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,001
You think that's how it works?

389
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:46,806
I didn't use to.

390
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:49,241
Then recently I tried...

391
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,979
Now I don't know.

392
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,527
<i>Good news.</i>

393
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:05,863
Advancing catheter

394
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:07,830
through interior jugular vein.

395
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:10,764
You told House you were at therapy.

396
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:13,496
Did you transcribe
the entire meeting?

397
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:16,031
Entering the cavernous sinus.

398
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:17,498
Your therapy's on thursdays.

399
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:19,433
Got rescheduled.

400
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:20,867
Injecting dye.

401
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:22,335
Really?

402
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:26,672
I'm not gonna rat you out.
We're friends.

403
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,209
Just wanna make sure you're okay.

404
00:22:31,844 --> 00:22:34,713
No filling defects.

405
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,217
Don't worry.

406
00:22:38,284 --> 00:22:40,885
I'm okay.

407
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,655
You think we can be friends

408
00:22:45,723 --> 00:22:47,891
when I get outta here?

409
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,792
Yeah.

410
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,561
We'll catch a ball game or...

411
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:53,429
Group sex show or something.

412
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,565
Put the cribbing in there.

413
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,535
Okay, now when the
beam starts lifting,

414
00:22:59,603 --> 00:23:01,937
you're gonna feel pain.

415
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,605
It's gonna be like your
foot's gone to sleep

416
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,873
times a billion.

417
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:06,541
You'll notice that
I'm waiting till now

418
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:07,875
to tell you.

419
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:10,143
All right. We're ready.

420
00:23:11,746 --> 00:23:12,913
Lifting.

421
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:17,583
I'm feeling the pain already.

422
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:18,917
<i>That's good.</i>

423
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:20,184
<i>That means the pressure's coming off.</i>

424
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:22,353
Much closer to getting out of here.

425
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,854
Aah!

426
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:27,358
Come on.

427
00:23:27,426 --> 00:23:29,761
Pull her out.

428
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:30,929
Come on!

429
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:33,531
It's moving!

430
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:38,102
Pull hard! Pull!

431
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,737
Aah!

432
00:24:10,646 --> 00:24:13,314
Hanna.

433
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:16,017
Hanna! What the hell happened?

434
00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:19,490
I think the adjacent beam
snapped during the lift.

435
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,360
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

436
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:23,830
<i>We had a secondary collapse.</i>

437
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:25,734
<i>We're all right.
How are you guys?</i>

438
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:27,704
<i>Rescue one, copy the mayday.</i>

439
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:29,474
<i>Main tunnel is fine.
Rescue's on the way.</i>

440
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:32,177
Lift this up.

441
00:24:32,244 --> 00:24:33,211
One, two--

442
00:24:44,258 --> 00:24:46,159
Kit. Gimme the Kit.

443
00:24:46,227 --> 00:24:48,061
All right.

444
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:50,130
No breath sounds on the left side.

445
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,732
Tension pneumothorax.

446
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,236
Okay, Hanna. One of
your lungs is collapsed.

447
00:24:55,304 --> 00:24:58,072
I'm gonna have to
reinflate it, okay?

448
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:07,349
Uh...

449
00:25:11,187 --> 00:25:12,420
<i>Hey.</i>

450
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:13,788
You better get back up top

451
00:25:13,856 --> 00:25:16,057
and make sure you
didn't Nick an artery.

452
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:25,665
I'm gonna have to go.

453
00:25:29,035 --> 00:25:31,502
That's okay. You're all right.

454
00:25:33,438 --> 00:25:36,007
You're lucky this isn't worse.

455
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:38,812
You know who's even luckier?

456
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,682
You and just about
every other human being

457
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:43,250
Who wasn't down there.

458
00:25:43,318 --> 00:25:44,851
What did the venogram say?

459
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,051
<i>Clean.</i>

460
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,783
Now the guy's starting
to spike a fever.

461
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,045
Subarachnoid bleed.

462
00:25:50,112 --> 00:25:52,179
Meningitis? He didn't
say his neck was sore.

463
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:53,613
That's 'cause everything's sore.

464
00:25:53,681 --> 00:25:57,016
He just took a 15-story
swan dive into concrete.

465
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,984
<i>Do an lp.</i> We also have to
consider other infections.

466
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:00,418
So you're suggesting we do an lp.

467
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:01,753
I guess I am.

468
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:03,221
Genius.

469
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:05,122
Hey, bad news.

470
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,257
Because of the collapse,
we can't try the airbag again

471
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:09,522
until we get
everything off the top.

472
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,256
<i>Be five, six hours at least.</i>

473
00:26:11,324 --> 00:26:12,591
Then we have to amputate.

474
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,025
No.

475
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:15,593
<i>It's been four hours already.</i>

476
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:18,228
It used to be a long shot.
Now it's...crazy.

477
00:26:18,296 --> 00:26:20,964
Crush syndrome is basically
a buildup of potassium.

478
00:26:21,032 --> 00:26:23,332
If we remove potassium-- we're already
treating with sodium bicarbonate.

479
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,067
But not with glucose and Insulin.

480
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:26,368
We have glucose in the Kit.

481
00:26:26,436 --> 00:26:28,237
There's gotta be a
diabetic here somewhere.

482
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:29,439
<i>You wanna dose the Insulin</i>

483
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,674
here in a non-hospital setting?

484
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:33,976
That is insane! It's not worth it.

485
00:26:34,044 --> 00:26:35,811
Really? 'Cause I think

486
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:38,380
I'm the only one here who
knows what a leg is worth.

487
00:26:38,448 --> 00:26:41,049
And fortunately, you're not
the one in charge--he is.

488
00:26:41,117 --> 00:26:42,751
And he knows that I'd
testify against him

489
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:44,084
if Hanna sues for cutting off a leg

490
00:26:44,152 --> 00:26:46,417
without exhausting every option.

491
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:48,854
Give us a minute?

492
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:53,631
I know you're angry,

493
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,634
but please don't put
her life at risk

494
00:26:55,702 --> 00:26:57,102
just to get back at me.

495
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,339
Really? Wow.

496
00:27:00,407 --> 00:27:02,241
So this is all about you now.

497
00:27:02,308 --> 00:27:04,710
You took her side against me

498
00:27:04,777 --> 00:27:06,410
right after you heard
about my engagement.

499
00:27:06,478 --> 00:27:08,012
Yeah. That must be it.

500
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,579
It's not that you're a
pathetic narcissist.

501
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:11,848
I don't love you.

502
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:14,617
So just...accept it

503
00:27:14,685 --> 00:27:15,918
and move on with your life

504
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:17,452
instead of making
everyone miserable.

505
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,087
That's great.

506
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:21,222
A life lesson from a
middle-aged single mom

507
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,588
who's dating a man-child.

508
00:27:22,656 --> 00:27:24,887
Screw you.

509
00:27:24,954 --> 00:27:27,189
I'm sick of making excuses for you.

510
00:27:27,256 --> 00:27:30,559
I'm sick of other people
having to tiptoe around you

511
00:27:30,627 --> 00:27:31,927
and make their own lives worse

512
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:35,597
while they try to keep
you from collapsing.

513
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:38,466
I'm done.

514
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:40,001
Fantastic.

515
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:43,500
Just stay away from my patient.

516
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:46,400
What are you clinging to, House?

517
00:27:46,468 --> 00:27:49,234
You're gonna risk her
life just to save her leg?

518
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:51,497
Really worked out well
for you, didn't it?

519
00:27:51,565 --> 00:27:53,130
<i>What do you have in your life,
honestly?</i>

520
00:27:53,198 --> 00:27:54,830
<i>Tell me.</i>

521
00:27:54,898 --> 00:27:56,331
I'm moving on.

522
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,366
Wilson is moving on.

523
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,567
And you...You've
got nothing, House.

524
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,535
<i>Nothing.</i>

525
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:04,569
I'm going down there,

526
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:08,405
and I'm gonna convince her
to let me cut her leg off.

527
00:28:08,473 --> 00:28:10,940
<i>If you have any decency left,
you'll just stay out of it.</i>

528
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,215
No.

529
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,785
Dr. House promised.

530
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:25,620
If there was any other way...

531
00:28:25,688 --> 00:28:28,790
It doesn't hurt right now.
I can wait.

532
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:33,694
Dr. House.

533
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:36,897
Tell her.

534
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,870
Hanna...

535
00:28:43,938 --> 00:28:46,606
We have to amputate your leg.

536
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:47,807
<i>No.</i>

537
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:50,310
You said... That there was time.

538
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:52,979
There was. And it's run out.

539
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:57,017
No.

540
00:28:57,084 --> 00:29:00,987
<i>You asked me how I'd hurt my leg.</i>

541
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:05,959
I had a blood clot,
and the muscle was dying.

542
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:08,462
And I had all these doctors
telling me I should amputate,

543
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,999
and I said no, and they did this...

544
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,267
Very risky operation.

545
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:14,503
I almost died.

546
00:29:14,571 --> 00:29:16,271
But you saved your leg.

547
00:29:18,074 --> 00:29:20,542
I wish I hadn't.

548
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,347
They cut out a chunk of muscle
about the size of my fist,

549
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:26,849
and they left me
with this mutilated,

550
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:30,020
useless thing.

551
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:34,992
I'm in pain...every day.

552
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,595
It changed me.

553
00:29:37,663 --> 00:29:41,000
Made me a harder person,

554
00:29:41,068 --> 00:29:43,471
a worse person.

555
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:45,743
And now...

556
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,954
Now I'm alone.

557
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:59,132
You don't want to be like me.

558
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,568
You got a husband who loves you.

559
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:04,538
You have friends.
You can start a family.

560
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:07,207
You have a life.

561
00:30:09,648 --> 00:30:13,283
And this... This is just a leg.

562
00:30:29,635 --> 00:30:32,737
Okay.

563
00:30:50,944 --> 00:30:52,076
I can't put you out.

564
00:30:52,527 --> 00:30:54,853
It could depress your
respiration too much.

565
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:57,086
This should take away
some of the pain.

566
00:31:03,393 --> 00:31:05,193
Will it be quick?

567
00:31:07,563 --> 00:31:10,966
I'll use a scalpel to
slice through the skin,

568
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:13,367
muscle, and fat.

569
00:31:13,435 --> 00:31:15,202
That should go pretty fast.

570
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,702
Then I'll switch over
to the electric saw

571
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,103
when I get to the bone.

572
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:21,171
It's two bones... About
as thick as a broomstick.

573
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:24,073
Takes about as long to get through.

574
00:31:24,141 --> 00:31:26,909
I'm gonna cut as close
to the concrete as I can,

575
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,444
save as much of your
limb as possible.

576
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,446
Then the orthopedic surgeons
back at the hospital

577
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,318
will clean you up,
have you fitted for a prosthetic.

578
00:31:34,385 --> 00:31:37,488
You'll be running circles
around me in no time.

579
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:46,236
How bad will it hurt?

580
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,810
Like nothing you've
ever felt before.

581
00:32:57,954 --> 00:33:00,993
Aah!

582
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:43,609
Hanna.

583
00:33:43,676 --> 00:33:45,310
Oh...Baby.

584
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:47,112
I'm so sorry.

585
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,647
Shut up. You always loved my legs.

586
00:33:49,715 --> 00:33:51,685
I don't care about your legs.

587
00:33:51,752 --> 00:33:53,654
Baby, I love you.

588
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:55,288
I love you.

589
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:56,556
I love you. I love you.

590
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:36,155
What?

591
00:34:36,223 --> 00:34:37,456
He's fallen into a coma.

592
00:34:37,524 --> 00:34:39,057
Lp was clean, but...

593
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:40,592
<i>What are his vitals?</i>

594
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,026
<i>Excuse me, officer.</i>

595
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:43,227
What do you mean, officer?

596
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:44,860
How long has there
been a cop there?

597
00:34:44,928 --> 00:34:46,528
I don't know. Ten minutes.

598
00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:48,597
He was being questioned
when he fell into the coma.

599
00:34:48,664 --> 00:34:50,532
Was anything else
making him nervous

600
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,607
<i>or worri before his other symptoms?</i>

601
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:54,111
He was claustrophobic
right before the bleed

602
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,717
and before the fever.

603
00:34:55,784 --> 00:34:57,853
We told him that he
probably did fall asleep.

604
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,955
<i>Was his bp spiking?</i>

605
00:35:00,023 --> 00:35:01,890
But that didn't cause
his first symptom.

606
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:04,759
Yeah, it did. All the caffeine.

607
00:35:04,827 --> 00:35:06,461
We thought the problem
was in his toilet--

608
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:08,029
by that, of course,
I mean his head.

609
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:09,697
<i>Which distracted us</i>
<i>from the fact</i>

610
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:11,900
<i>that it could have been just a clog
in his sewer pipe,</i>

611
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:14,502
<i>and by that, of course,
i mean his spinal cord.</i>

612
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,638
And blah, blah, blah, blah.
You get the idea.

613
00:35:16,705 --> 00:35:18,239
An arachnoid cyst
on his lower spine.

614
00:35:18,307 --> 00:35:19,708
That's why we missed it.

615
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:21,042
<i>He's been sitting ten hours a day.</i>

616
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,777
<i>Spiked his spinal fluid pressure.</i>

617
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:24,279
Run a ct--

618
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:29,384
Bp's 72 over 42.  <i>Hanna?</i>

619
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:30,718
Hanna? I can't breathe.

620
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:32,752
I can't breathe.

621
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:38,691
Breath sounds bilaterally.
It's not another pneumothorax.

622
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:41,663
Neck veins flat.
There's no tamponade.

623
00:35:43,499 --> 00:35:45,266
Damn it. I waited too long.

624
00:35:45,334 --> 00:35:47,068
Hanna, you've got a
clot in your lung.

625
00:35:47,136 --> 00:35:48,603
I'm gonna fix this.

626
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,404
Iv streptokinase.

627
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:52,940
What's happening. What's going on?

628
00:35:53,008 --> 00:35:55,476
Her body won't get any oxygen
unless we can bust the clot.

629
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:57,845
<i>This is a blood thinner.</i>

630
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,618
Is she gonna be all right?

631
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:06,755
It's gonna make her bleed more.
We'll take care of that next.

632
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,494
It's not busting the clot.

633
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:15,661
Maybe it's her heart.

634
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:32,310
What?

635
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:35,245
It's not a clot.

636
00:36:35,313 --> 00:36:37,247
It's a fat embolism.

637
00:36:37,315 --> 00:36:39,582
From the amputation.

638
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:46,757
<i>Okay. So--so what can we do?</i>

639
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:49,759
Come on.

640
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:54,297
<i>Do something. Please, please,
do something.</i>

641
00:36:54,365 --> 00:36:56,232
<i>Come on, guys, do something.
Come on.</i>

642
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,035
<i>Come on. Please, come on,
do something!</i>

643
00:36:59,103 --> 00:37:01,137
<i>Come on, do something!
Do something!</i>

644
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:34,093
There's no way to
prevent a fat embolism.

645
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,421
Even if you'd done this in an O.R.,

646
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:40,024
couldn't have saved her.

647
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,005
You can't blame
yourself for her death.

648
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,974
This wasn't your fault.

649
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,475
That's the point!

650
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:02,344
I did everything right.
She died anyway.

651
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:05,980
Why the hell do you think that
would make me feel any better?

652
00:38:15,621 --> 00:38:17,622
You shouldn't be alone right now.

653
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:21,959
You're bleeding.

654
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:26,129
I'm gonna give you a
task as an employee.

655
00:38:26,197 --> 00:38:29,165
Get out of my way.

656
00:38:52,385 --> 00:38:56,388
What's that?

657
00:38:56,456 --> 00:38:59,491
I'm asking for some time off.

658
00:39:01,628 --> 00:39:03,196
What's wrong?

659
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:10,504
Are you okay?

660
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:14,276
Obviously not.

661
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:07,259
? ?

662
00:41:12,464 --> 00:41:14,732
you going to leap across the room

663
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,801
and grab them out of my hand?

664
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,505
<i>No.</i>

665
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:24,641
<i>It's your choice if you want
to go back on drugs.</i>

666
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:28,645
Okay.

667
00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:30,414
Just so you know,

668
00:41:30,482 --> 00:41:33,184
I'm finding it hard
to see the downside.

669
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:36,720
You need to re-bandage
your shoulder.

670
00:41:40,223 --> 00:41:42,724
Is that why you're here?
Foreman sent you?

671
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,792
No.

672
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,793
You here to yell at me again?

673
00:41:46,861 --> 00:41:49,095
<i>No.</i>

674
00:41:49,163 --> 00:41:52,331
Well, I'm running out of ideas.

675
00:41:52,399 --> 00:41:54,767
Lucas...

676
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:57,335
<i>Oh, great.</i>

677
00:41:57,403 --> 00:41:58,670
You're feeling uncomfortable again?

678
00:41:58,738 --> 00:42:00,505
Probably means you just got back

679
00:42:00,573 --> 00:42:02,173
from some quickie wedding in Vegas

680
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:03,441
or you're already pregnant.

681
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:04,775
I ended it.

682
00:42:07,846 --> 00:42:09,279
What?

683
00:42:09,347 --> 00:42:11,748
I'm stuck, House.

684
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,283
I keep wanting to move forward.

685
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:18,252
I keep wanting to move on,
and I can't.

686
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,887
<i>I mean, my new house,
with my new fiance,</i>

687
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:23,221
<i>and all I can think about is you.</i>

688
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,657
I just need to know

689
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:30,058
if you and I can work.

690
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:36,363
You think I can fix myself?

691
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:38,665
I don't know.

692
00:42:42,003 --> 00:42:45,806
'Cause I'm the most screwed-up
person in the world.

693
00:42:45,874 --> 00:42:47,508
<i>I know.</i>

694
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:50,877
I love you.

695
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:58,517
I wish I didn't.

696
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:00,085
But I can't help it.

697
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,222
How do I know I'm
not hallucinating?

698
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:42,925
Did you take the Vicodin?

699
00:43:42,992 --> 00:43:47,127
No.

700
00:43:47,195 --> 00:43:50,563
Then I think we're okay.

701
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:55,633
Yeah.

702
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,568
