1
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:21,708
Okay.

2
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:24,011
"Therafy" me.

3
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,754
You're late.

4
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:36,023
You're fat.

5
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,760
It's unusual.

6
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:42,062
You know how far
the parking lot is?

7
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,597
My leg's been hurting.

8
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,332
Anything been on your mind lately,

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,367
any particular stress?

10
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:49,803
No. Probably just gonna rain.

11
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,872
Mm-hmm. You like the
new Monet reproduction

12
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,941
in the waiting room--

13
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:55,809
the <i>Water Lilies?</i>

14
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:57,578
I was late.

15
00:00:57,645 --> 00:00:59,847
I wasn't focusing on the decor,

16
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:03,250
but it sounds appropriately
bland and calming.

17
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:05,619
<i>Stress can also make you absentminded.</i>

18
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:07,855
I'm not stressed...

19
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:09,623
Beyond the stress induced

20
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:12,893
by you telling me
how stressed I am.

21
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:14,494
Just an ordinary week.

22
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:20,367
Okay.

23
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:22,336
Tell me about it.

24
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:27,507
<i>I had a patient.</i>

25
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:29,776
<i>House.</i>

26
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:32,613
Good. I have a case for you.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,548
Beer?

28
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:36,049
Amnesia.

29
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:38,785
She was found jogging in
the street, disoriented.

30
00:01:38,853 --> 00:01:40,988
She almost got hit by a truck.

31
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:42,289
The MRI showed no abnormalities.

32
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:44,524
<i>No I.D. on her.</i>

33
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:47,361
<i>Just her jogging clothes and
her heart rate monitor.</i>

34
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:48,829
We know absolutely
nothing about her.

35
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:50,664
We know she has money.

36
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:53,834
Blaze outriggers-
400 bucks a pair.

37
00:01:53,902 --> 00:01:55,969
<i>People who have money don't
just disappear.</i>

38
00:01:56,037 --> 00:01:57,971
Sooner or later, someone's
gonna show up looking for her.

39
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,840
Can I have something to eat?

40
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:01,608
She just ate 15 minutes ago.

41
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:03,143
She keeps forgetting.

42
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:06,213
You don't eat because you
remember it's time to eat.

43
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:07,781
You eat 'cause you're hungry.

44
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:10,584
Her metabolism is in high gear.

45
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:13,253
She is an extreme
long-distance runner--

46
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:15,289
<i>Why were you in the ER?</i>

47
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:18,225
That's your question?

48
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:19,860
You're a psychotherapist.

49
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:21,628
You're hearing about
a great amnesia case,

50
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:23,397
and all you're asking
me is geography.

51
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:25,899
Just curious.

52
00:02:29,237 --> 00:02:31,772
I was avoiding Wilson.

53
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:34,708
It's not something you
couldn't have seen

54
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:36,910
eight miles away.

55
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:39,680
<i>Wilson's a processor.</i>

56
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:41,014
<i>I knew there were some things</i>

57
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:43,083
<i>that he'd want to process with me...</i>

58
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:44,384
<i>At length.</i>

59
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:47,854
Sam's moving in.

60
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:50,223
If it's before Friday,
your assistant wins the pool.

61
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:54,261
I was just wondering
what your plans were.

62
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,762
Tonight?

63
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,732
In life.

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,233
Sam likes you...

65
00:03:00,301 --> 00:03:02,069
But she wants me to move out.

66
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:03,570
No.

67
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:06,506
I want you to move out.

68
00:03:06,574 --> 00:03:10,210
I didn't know things with
Sam would happen so quickly.

69
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:11,378
I didn't--

70
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,013
I don't want to
make a mistake here.

71
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:14,414
I've made a lot of mistakes.

72
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:15,782
By moving too quickly.

73
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,617
Given your usual
rate of commitment,

74
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:21,221
I'm surprised you're not
already re-divorced.

75
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:23,457
I could help you find a place.

76
00:03:23,524 --> 00:03:25,359
What's wrong with my old place?

77
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:26,727
Nothing. I just thought...

78
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:29,329
You might want to
find somewhere new,

79
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:31,798
somewhere...

80
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:35,302
Where I didn't abuse
drugs and hallucinate.

81
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,204
Yes.

82
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,106
I'm fine.

83
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:40,741
<i>You're fine?</i>

84
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,843
Your best friend
is tossing you out,

85
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,212
and you're fine?

86
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,981
Why wouldn't I be?

87
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:53,553
<font color=#ffff00>? House 6x20 ?</font>

89
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:19,993
? ?

90
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:26,218
<i>You're not feeling a little...</i>

91
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:29,390
betrayed and angry?

92
00:04:30,358 --> 00:04:31,858
Wilson bought a two-bedroom condo

93
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:34,094
specifically so that you
could move in with him.

94
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:35,829
It wasn't that long ago.

95
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:37,697
You don't feel a little...

96
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:40,367
jerked around?

97
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:42,936
He couldn't foresee Sam
coming back into his life.

98
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:45,639
That's a very rational
defense of your friend.

99
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:47,941
And, uh, I'm not buying it.

100
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,409
Based on what?

101
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:51,478
Based on the fact
that you were late,

102
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:53,747
and you didn't notice the
pictures in the outer office.

103
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:55,749
Those aren't symptoms.
They are to me.

104
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:57,117
And here's another one.

105
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:59,453
You took the case. Hmm?

106
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,988
No negotiating, no bargaining.

107
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,990
No clinic hours changed hands.

108
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:05,358
Were you looking for something

109
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:06,660
to distract you from the fact

110
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:08,762
that your best friend
just threw you out?

111
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,231
Case was interesting.
It's not organic.

112
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:12,699
It's not mysterious.

113
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:16,103
Most likely some psychologically
traumatic event occurred

114
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,840
that made the patient's brain
choose to forget everything.

115
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:21,074
Or not.

116
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:23,009
Here.

117
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:25,979
Loss of differentiation
between gray and white matter.

118
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:27,781
<i>That's subtle.</i>

119
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,616
But it's in the area
that controls memory.

120
00:05:29,684 --> 00:05:31,418
Not likely it's a coincidence.

121
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:33,820
Bacterial infection?

122
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:35,989
Do I need to know this?

123
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:38,358
Fine. I'll give you the
cliff notes version--

124
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:40,260
chase--m.S. Taub--physical trauma.

125
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:42,028
I can tell you why
we ruled them out.

126
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:44,731
Or not.

127
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,600
It's probably a toxin,

128
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,101
and we need to find it
before it kills her.

129
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:49,402
We should search her House.

130
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,971
Good luck with that.

131
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,641
Her heart rate monitor
has a serial number.

132
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:55,809
<i>The distributor can match
the number</i>

133
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,110
<i>to the store that sold it.</i>

134
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:58,578
She's a serious athlete.

135
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:00,080
She might have been there
often enough to be remembered.

136
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:01,681
Brilliant.

137
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:02,782
<i>Did he really say that?</i>

138
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,651
Subtextually.

139
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,653
Long shot.

140
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:08,488
Even if the store clerk
doesn't know who she is,

141
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:10,157
the store's probably
close to where she lives.

142
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:11,925
Just seeing those surroundings
might spark a memory.

143
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:13,693
You want us to take her there?

144
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:14,928
<i>No.</i>

145
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:16,730
I'll take her.

146
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:19,399
Really?

147
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:21,134
Uh, it's unusual for you to
spend time with a patient,

148
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:22,269
isn't it?

149
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:23,904
Patients are boring...

150
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:25,138
As people.

151
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:26,840
This one I'm sure was no exception,

152
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:29,442
but her situation was interesting.

153
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,212
Besides, I was still
avoiding Wilson.

154
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,414
And no better way to avoid
than leaving the hospital.

155
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:35,682
Maybe.

156
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,884
Or were you avoiding going home?

157
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:39,486
There's a reason they tell addicts

158
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:41,454
to stay away from old geography.

159
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:42,856
I wasn't avoiding going home.

160
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:45,091
I'd already gone home...

161
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,960
Before I came into work that day.

162
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:49,229
I went straight
there from Wilson's.

163
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:54,935
<i>Hey, take it easy! You're gonna kill me!</i>

164
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:56,369
<i>God, why don't people knock?</i>

165
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:58,205
House, it's you! Where you been?

166
00:06:58,272 --> 00:07:00,106
Hold up a second.

167
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:01,675
<i>Alvie?</i>

168
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:04,678
Juan alvarez-- you let
him stay at your place?

169
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:07,380
Not exactly.

170
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:13,820
I was beginning to wonder if
you were ever gonna show up.

171
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:16,423
<i>Su casa, mi casa. Casa!</i>

172
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,858
Why are you here?

173
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:20,193
When I left Mayfield,

174
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:21,861
I went back to the
old neighborhood.

175
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:24,598
You know, you shouldn't leave
the bathroom window unlocked.

176
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:25,699
Yeah, thanks for the safety lesson.

177
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:27,000
Why are you here?

178
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:28,468
Like I said, when I went
back to the neighborhood,

179
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:30,170
I found out immigration
was looking for me.

180
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:32,539
So I decided to visit
my old buddy House!

181
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,874
And turn his apartment into
a giant prison jumpsuit.

182
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:36,142
Juan alvarez is no freeloader.

183
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,677
I do my part, earn my keep.

184
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:39,246
The first week I made your dinner,

185
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:40,814
but you never showed up.

186
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,415
<i>The second week i organized your stuff.</i>

187
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,718
My stuff?

188
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:46,052
But still, you never showed up.

189
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,854
<i>So this week, since I'm a real
good painter,</i>

190
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:49,656
<i>i decided to--</i> coffee table--

191
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:52,492
where'd you put it?

192
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,294
In the bedroom?

193
00:07:54,362 --> 00:07:56,496
The paint's not cheap, House.
It's a custom color.

194
00:07:56,564 --> 00:07:59,032
It's a mix of titanium,
yellow, and ochre.

195
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,433
Ochre--I don't even
like that stuff.

196
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,068
It's like a fruit.
It's got hair on it.

197
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:03,536
But they say it's a vegetable--

198
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:08,141
you sold my table to pay for
paint that I don't want?

199
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:11,978
I had to sell some
other things too.

200
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:16,516
Get out.

201
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,818
No, papa, just give
the color a chance.

202
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:20,487
Look, I'm going to work now.

203
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,088
And when I come back,

204
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:24,090
the walls will be a
less exciting color,

205
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:27,027
and you will be gone.

206
00:08:27,094 --> 00:08:30,697
So Wilson threw you out,
and you threw alvie out--

207
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:32,732
just, uh, another week?

208
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,701
<i>Unlike me, alvie didn't leave.</i>

209
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,503
I took my motorcycle
to work that day.

210
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,571
When I went home to get my car,

211
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,574
he was painting the
ceiling magenta.

212
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:44,411
So I brought him with me
to protect the apartment.

213
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:46,046
Why?

214
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:48,148
To protect the apartment.

215
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:49,683
Whoa. Deja vu.

216
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,318
<i>Tossing him out</i>

217
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:52,852
or, uh, sending him to the movies

218
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,587
or, uh, locking him in the bathroom

219
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:57,257
would also minimize
alvie's destructive force.

220
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:59,959
But you chose his
company deliberately.

221
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:01,361
Why?

222
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:03,330
<i>Obviously because he's a Wilson
substitute.</i>

223
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:05,332
You can barely tell the
difference between them,

224
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,167
especially when Wilson
raps about the hood.

225
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:08,902
I'm not suggesting
alvie's a substitute,

226
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:10,837
but he would make a
great distraction.

227
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:12,339
From what?

228
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:13,907
<i>That's what I'm trying to find out.</i>

229
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:17,777
Go on.

230
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:24,517
Maybe the heart rate
monitor was a gift.

231
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:25,919
That's why no one recognized her.

232
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:27,921
Shut up, alvie.

233
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:29,522
Anything familiar...

234
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,525
Church, grocery store?

235
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:34,094
Sorry.

236
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:35,662
It's okay, Ms. x.

237
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,530
Maybe she's never been
to this town before,

238
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:39,833
bought the heart rate monitor
on the store's website.

239
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,901
You know that puerto ricans are U.
S. citizens, right?

240
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:43,236
Instead of working the case,

241
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:45,138
why don't you contemplate
the inanity of an American

242
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,539
with American immigration issues?

243
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:48,775
I had a birth certificate.
I lost it.

244
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:50,744
So get a new one.
I tried that, House.

245
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:52,545
But the town hall had burned
down when I was a kid,

246
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:53,780
destroyed the records.

247
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:55,248
There's only one copy?

248
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:58,118
They tried to make me fill
out a whole bunch of forms

249
00:09:58,185 --> 00:09:59,919
before they'd give it to me.

250
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:02,155
I decided it would be quicker
and easier to do it myself.

251
00:10:02,223 --> 00:10:04,257
How'd that go? They
figured out it was forged.

252
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:05,492
And now, for some reason,

253
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,026
they don't believe anything I say.

254
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:09,229
They actually think I'm lying
about being puerto rican.

255
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:11,831
Told me I had to go to a
special hearing to prove it.

256
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,834
What if nothing
ever looks familiar?

257
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:19,939
Then someone will show up-
a spouse, a friend--

258
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:21,541
to tell you who you really are

259
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:23,143
and what you should be feeling.

260
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,611
They always do.

261
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:27,814
I don't know who that is...

262
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:29,616
But I miss him.

263
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,154
What did they say at the hearing?

264
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,889
<i>I didn't go.</i>

265
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:37,323
I lied once.

266
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:38,391
Your mother is puerto rican,

267
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,726
therefore, you are puerto rican.

268
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:41,094
All you got to do is prove
your mom's your mom,

269
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:42,662
find some documentation--

270
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,898
people like that don't
listen to people like me.

271
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:47,033
Doughnuts! Hey, House,
let's get doughnuts!

272
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:48,735
Alvie, the hearing-
everyone loves doughnuts--

273
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:50,170
glazed, crullers, elephant ears,

274
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:51,905
even doughnut holes.

275
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:53,373
Much better than the
sporting goods store.

276
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:54,674
I went Mrs.
x went there all the time.

277
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,376
We're not here--

278
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:59,078
<i>And then I realized...</i>

279
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:00,613
You make a good point.

280
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:02,649
Really? I was making that up.

281
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:05,485
Dozen glazed, dozen jelly-filled?

282
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:08,154
You want the usual, right?

283
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,523
Your old friend,
the fried carbohydrate.

284
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,525
She needed the
calorically dense food

285
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:14,093
to support the running habit.

286
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:15,695
<i>Do you know her name?</i>

287
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:19,332
Sandy...

288
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,700
<i>Or shelley.</i>

289
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,068
<i>I don't know.
The guy she's with</i>

290
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:23,269
called her that once.

291
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:24,938
I just work here.

292
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:26,372
Do you know where they live?

293
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,943
He left a business card
in our free doughnut jar.

294
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,644
It's up on the wall of winners.

295
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:40,854
Sidney.

296
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:46,726
God, I was so worried about you.

297
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:49,395
What happened?

298
00:11:58,338 --> 00:12:00,073
The police said it was
too soon to do anything,

299
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:02,541
<i>so I started calling hospitals
on my own.</i>

300
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:04,743
<i>Princeton Plainsboro wasn't
even on my list.</i>

301
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:05,944
<i>You really think something
around here</i>

302
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:08,280
<i>could have made her sick?</i>

303
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:10,882
<i>Here, work, anywhere she could
have been exposed.</i>

304
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,285
Why wasn't Princeton
Plainsboro on your list?

305
00:12:13,352 --> 00:12:15,720
Well, I mean,
it's a long way to run,

306
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:16,955
even for her.

307
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,292
What is it I do besides run?

308
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:24,963
You're a lawyer--

309
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:26,998
civil rights, class action suits.

310
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:29,434
It's a stressful job.

311
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:31,469
Running's the way you deal with it.

312
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:33,371
That doesn't sound like me.

313
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:34,773
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

314
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,374
what would sound like you?

315
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:38,844
Good point.

316
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,846
<i>So what were you thinking during all this?</i>

317
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:44,549
<i>That it was a strange position to be in.</i>

318
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,651
<i>At that moment, she was</i>
<i>more comfortable with me</i>

319
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,086
<i>than with her husband.</i>

320
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:51,189
<i>And he was picking up on it.</i>

321
00:12:51,257 --> 00:12:52,958
<i>What about you?</i>

322
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:54,926
What about me how?

323
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:57,495
Well, there was a sort of, um,

324
00:12:57,563 --> 00:13:00,232
artificial intimacy between you?

325
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:01,766
<i>She'd been dependent on you.</i>

326
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:04,336
<i>Uh, did you find that attractive
on some level?</i>

327
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:06,638
Disturbing?

328
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:08,440
Those are my two choices?

329
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:10,742
<i>None of the above.</i>

330
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,979
She was just a patient.
She was interesting.

331
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:19,851
So we're really...

332
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,753
Married?

333
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:23,388
For four years.

334
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:25,891
Ms. X, you lead a lemon fresh life.

335
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,959
<i>Found three different cleansers
under the sink.</i>

336
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:29,561
Cleaned out the
medicine cabinets too.

337
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:30,896
You know, she just won a settlement

338
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:32,864
for some families whose
housing development

339
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:35,066
<i>was built on an old methane field.</i>

340
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:37,535
<i>Toxic exposure to methane</i>
<i>could explain this.</i>

341
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:39,504
I surf?

342
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:41,373
You stopped before we met.

343
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,010
You've been too busy.

344
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:47,145
And we're married?

345
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:49,114
Yes.

346
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:51,049
<i>All right, it's nothing personal.</i>

347
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:53,218
Bet she didn't think
you were her type

348
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:54,686
<i>back when you first met either.</i>

349
00:13:54,754 --> 00:13:56,021
We'll take her back
to the hospital,

350
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,356
test her blood and urine
and start treatment.

351
00:13:58,424 --> 00:14:00,859
Oh!

352
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,394
I'm all right.

353
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:04,729
What happened? I don't know.

354
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:06,631
My foot suddenly went numb.

355
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,566
Her pants are wet.

356
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:11,903
Urinary incontinence.

357
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:15,240
She's having complex
partial seizures.

358
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:17,142
This isn't methane.

359
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:19,844
You can leave the bucket.
We need to get her to--

360
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:21,746
<i>Seizures?</i>

361
00:14:21,814 --> 00:14:24,182
This is the second diagnosis
you've come up with

362
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,117
that has a personal
resonance for you.

363
00:14:26,185 --> 00:14:29,321
I'm choosing my diagnoses
based on personal issues?

364
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:31,589
You think she fell down the
stairs and peed her pants

365
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:33,491
'cause Wilson dumped her too?

366
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,793
You're choosing to tell
me about this case,

367
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,328
so let's look at it.

368
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:37,963
First you were fixated on a
harmful toxin from her past,

369
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,198
<i>possibly because you're worried</i>
<i>about a harmful toxin</i>

370
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:42,367
<i>from your own past.
</i> Chase had the toxin idea.

371
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:43,768
Maybe he's obsessed with my past.

372
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:45,203
And now you're talking
about a seizure disorder?

373
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:47,038
Which is also not a toxin.

374
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:48,473
But which is most likely caused

375
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,175
by an old injury to the brain.

376
00:14:50,242 --> 00:14:54,112
W-why do you see your
past as such a threat?

377
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,747
Not only am I unthreatened by it,

378
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:57,482
I was trying to get it back.

379
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,451
There's a ding mark.

380
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:01,519
<i>It's a piece of junk.</i>

381
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:03,788
It was dinged when it came in.

382
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:06,057
Sure, the--the cup marks and
the scuffs and the paint

383
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,625
and those three chips.

384
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:08,994
<i>This fourth one is new.</i>

385
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:11,062
I run a pawn shop,
not a storage company.

386
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,530
Do you want it or not?

387
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:15,333
That should be it.

388
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:17,635
You said you pawned five books.

389
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:19,104
There's only four.

390
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:21,272
That's all there is.

391
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,442
Where's <i>approach to the acute abdomen?</i>

392
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:27,812
Sold it.

393
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,514
To?

394
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:30,982
I can't tell you.

395
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,650
It's a law, and it should be.

396
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:36,021
Crazy bastards like you try
to hunt down their stuff.

397
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:41,026
How much for the pile?

398
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:44,863
$500.

399
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,531
You said it was junk.

400
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,732
No, no.

401
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,501
It's your junk. You want it.

402
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:53,038
$500-- take it or leave it.

403
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:59,677
? ?

404
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:03,314
why is it so important that
you get your stuff back?

405
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:05,750
Unlike the rest of humanity...

406
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:08,186
Who's okay when their
belongings are taken.

407
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:10,789
Everyone wants their stuff.
That's why it's their stuff.

408
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:12,724
Everyone doesn't pay five
times what it's worth.

409
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:14,192
I like my stuff.

410
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,760
I hate it when Wilson moves it--

411
00:16:15,828 --> 00:16:17,495
oh...

412
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:20,031
This is not about Wilson!

413
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:32,710
Say it.

414
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:42,487
I wasn't gonna say anything.

415
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,677
31, 31! Hike!

416
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:56,830
First down!

417
00:16:56,898 --> 00:16:57,931
One more, you get a touchdown.

418
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,233
Whoo!

419
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,136
Hike!

420
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:05,873
Huh!

421
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,541
House,

422
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,543
<i>you can't run for the touchdown.</i>

423
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:16,083
And...Hike!

424
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:17,584
<i>Wait, wait, wait. Wait.</i>

425
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:19,052
<i>You seriously thought you
were gonna tell me</i>

426
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,488
that Wilson showed up but
not tell me what he said?

427
00:17:21,556 --> 00:17:22,956
Because I thought
you were a smart guy

428
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,892
who didn't need the obvious
spelled out to him.

429
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,860
<i>Wilson noticed</i>

430
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:28,428
that I didn't come
to my office all day.

431
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:30,631
He came to find me,
wanted to make sure I'm okay--

432
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:32,566
boring, boring, boring.

433
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,134
Um, but you thought
it was important

434
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:35,569
to tell me about nerf football?

435
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,772
<i>Sorry. Your story.</i>

436
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,607
Continue.

437
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,878
House, House, stop! Stop,
stop, stop.

438
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:46,547
You okay?

439
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:49,349
Yeah.

440
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:53,120
It was my mother's.
She died when I was four.

441
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,122
It's all I have left.

442
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,924
That's very sad, alvie.

443
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,126
Listen, I set up an
immigration hearing.

444
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,727
No, House,

445
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:02,095
I'm gonna end up in jail or worse--

446
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:04,865
the Dominican or someplace.
<i>Que se yo. Que no.</i>

447
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:07,167
<i>Um, interesting.</i>

448
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:08,735
You present yourself as,
uh, not giving a damn

449
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:10,604
about other people's emotions,

450
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,473
<i>but your actions indicate otherwise.</i>

451
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,475
You dismiss alvie's
story about his mother,

452
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:18,178
but you cared enough
to schedule a hearing.

453
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:20,681
I cared for eight seconds.

454
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:23,050
Then I got distracted.

455
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:28,622
Yeah.

456
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,557
<i>We've kept the patient up for 12 hours now.</i>

457
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,359
<i>No hint of seizure-like activity.</i>

458
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:33,827
<i>We should shut this down.</i>

459
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:35,596
Try a strobe light,
add more stress.

460
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:37,531
<i>I think there's plenty</i>
<i>of stress in here.</i>

461
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,700
Don't we ever do anything but work?

462
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,502
You run. That's just more work.

463
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,972
What about fun?

464
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,607
God, how can we be this boring?

465
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:48,675
Apparently, without her memory,

466
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:50,777
the patient's
personality has returned

467
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:54,214
to what you might call
its natural state.

468
00:18:54,282 --> 00:18:57,918
<i>Seems she had a wake-up call while
she was at college.</i>

469
00:18:57,986 --> 00:18:59,987
Her brother died in a car accident.

470
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:02,289
She decided to make her
life mean something.

471
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,191
Went to law school.

472
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,195
Now that's all gone.

473
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:10,397
The thing that caused
the change is gone...

474
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,699
So the change itself is gone.

475
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,301
Yeah.

476
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:16,270
I knew the psychological
aspects of this case

477
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:18,038
would interest you.

478
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,274
Bet you got a theory already.
What is it?

479
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:22,309
It's not relevant.

480
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,344
What is it?

481
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:29,016
Why do you care about my theory?

482
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,084
I think he just...

483
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:32,819
<i>Bores her.</i>

484
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:34,921
<i>She's at an earlier stage
of development.</i>

485
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:36,890
<i>She's looking at her grown-up future,</i>

486
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,325
<i>and it puts her to sleep.</i>

487
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:40,927
If he just bored her,

488
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:43,096
she'd hide it to be polite.

489
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:44,998
Their problem is synchronicity.

490
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,934
Just like you and me, House,
they're not on the same page.

491
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:49,102
He talks to her

492
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,904
like someone he
shares history with.

493
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:53,106
But from her point of view,
he's a stranger

494
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:54,975
<i>forcing intimacy on her.</i>

495
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,977
<i>Of course she doesn't like him.
He's not helping.</i>

496
00:19:57,045 --> 00:20:01,248
<i>He can feel he's losing his wife,</i>

497
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:03,116
and it makes him come on stronger.

498
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:08,522
He almost did lose his wife.

499
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,150
The breathing problem

500
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:38,318
was caused by fluid
overload in the lungs.

501
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:40,053
Diabetes insipidus.

502
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,656
And the d.I. Came from
damage to the hypothalamus.

503
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:44,725
Hypothalamus here, hence the d.
I. And incontinence.

504
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,727
They mingle here.
There's the global amnesia.

505
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:48,462
And the motor cortex-
that's the foot paralysis.

506
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:50,397
What do they all have in common?

507
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:52,165
<i>Okay, now you're just doing this
to mess with me.</i>

508
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,134
What possible relevance

509
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:55,802
does this differential
have to your problems?

510
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,773
It ends with a diagnosis
of spongiform encephalitis.

511
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,376
I convinced the team to cut out
part of this woman's brain.

512
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:03,710
That's not interesting to you?

513
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:04,778
No.

514
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,080
Not even if it's the amygdala?

515
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:09,416
She'll lose all her
long-term memory.

516
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:10,917
Well, this is where you tell me

517
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:12,686
that being cavalier
with someone else's past

518
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,921
has nothing to do with
avoiding your own past.

519
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:16,423
The case is irrelevant.

520
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:19,493
You just found it,
uh... Interesting.

521
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,396
Aren't therapists
supposed to be nurturing?

522
00:21:22,463 --> 00:21:24,264
Nowhere...

523
00:21:24,332 --> 00:21:27,234
Is that in the manual.

524
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:29,603
Look, you--you've been
in therapy for a year.

525
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,471
You know when I ask you
to talk about anything,

526
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:33,240
I mean anything that affects you--

527
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:35,008
what upset you, what made you mad

528
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:37,344
or relieved or joyful.

529
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:40,680
You want me to believe that
this case means nothing?

530
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:44,785
Then, um...

531
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:48,822
Why should I listen to it?

532
00:22:09,143 --> 00:22:11,344
Are you charging me for this time?

533
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:13,113
Yes.

534
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:18,185
This is ridiculous.

535
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:20,454
What's that?

536
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:23,390
<i>On the back of your arm?</i>

537
00:22:25,193 --> 00:22:28,094
It's just a bruise. And I fell.

538
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:30,730
You remember falling?

539
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:32,065
No.

540
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,433
I was drunk...

541
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:35,302
Hence the balance issues.

542
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:37,337
Well, it looks like you fell

543
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:39,473
on the tip of someone's boot.

544
00:22:45,513 --> 00:22:48,748
I said something that
someone objected to.

545
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:50,617
Well, if you don't remember,
then how can you--

546
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:52,052
<i>it's usually the way it is</i>

547
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,920
when someone hits me.

548
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:56,223
People who kick when
you're down are jerks,

549
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,024
but they're generally
not irrational jerks.

550
00:22:58,092 --> 00:23:00,126
Yogot drunk enough to
get into a bar fight

551
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:01,628
and not remember,

552
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:05,499
and you've been insisting
that everything's fine?

553
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:07,868
W-why--why go out
and get blind drunk?

554
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:10,470
<i>Were you looking for a fight?</i>

555
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:12,539
I don't know.

556
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:19,646
What have you screwed up?

557
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:21,248
What?

558
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:22,983
<i>You say that when you've been
hit in the past,</i>

559
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,719
it's because you provoked it
with something that you said,

560
00:23:25,786 --> 00:23:27,554
which means you're well
aware of the risks.

561
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:29,289
So on some level,

562
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:33,293
<i>you were in that bar looking</i>
<i>for someone to hurt you.</i>

563
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:35,428
<i>Logically, people punish
themselves</i>

564
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:38,398
for something they did or
something they didn't do.

565
00:23:40,234 --> 00:23:42,736
So what...

566
00:23:42,803 --> 00:23:45,071
Did you screw up?

567
00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:53,780
I don't know.

568
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:07,093
Okay, there may be a problem.

569
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:14,072
All right...

570
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:16,880
Let's talk about Wilson.

571
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:20,283
I told him your book
was contaminated

572
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:22,152
with Anthrax spores.

573
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:24,020
Then I gave him $300.

574
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,056
The address of the buyer.

575
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:30,260
Maybe I was hasty in
asking you to move out.

576
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:33,029
Why don't you stay with me
and Sam for a little while?

577
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,764
There's no need to hurry things.

578
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:37,367
What prompted this?

579
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,736
Look, the whole idea

580
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:42,672
was that after Mayfield,
you wouldn't be on your own.

581
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,908
I can touch base with
you a lot more easily

582
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:46,109
if you're staying with me than--

583
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:47,677
God's sake, Wilson.

584
00:24:47,745 --> 00:24:49,646
<i>You really span the chasm</i>

585
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:51,147
from wishy to washy.

586
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:53,483
If you're gonna be an ass,
be an ass.

587
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:55,485
Stick with it.

588
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:57,153
<i>Why were you being so hard on the guy,</i>

589
00:24:57,221 --> 00:24:58,521
when he was being conciliatory?

590
00:24:58,589 --> 00:24:59,489
<i>Come on.</i>

591
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:02,659
Cuddy played on his guilt.

592
00:25:02,727 --> 00:25:05,662
She put him up to this.
How do you know that?

593
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,497
How do you know this wasn't
entirely his own idea?

594
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:08,798
<i>Two reasons--</i>

595
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:11,201
first, he wants to create
the perfect environment

596
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:12,836
to be with Sam.

597
00:25:12,903 --> 00:25:15,672
<i>He's been thinking about asking me
to leave for a while.</i>

598
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,674
Finally he does it and
immediately turns around

599
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:19,442
and changes his mind--no.

600
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,510
He talked to somebody.

601
00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:22,545
Maybe it was Sam.

602
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,282
<i>Yeah, that's a possibility.</i>

603
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,818
I want this to be the
last serious relationship

604
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:30,387
I ever have.

605
00:25:30,454 --> 00:25:32,522
I want this to be the one.

606
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,657
Me too.

607
00:25:37,228 --> 00:25:38,528
Where's House?

608
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:40,864
It's not as meaningful without him.

609
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:42,732
Okay, um...

610
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,200
Not Sam.

611
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:46,469
<i>Uh, that still doesn't answer</i>
<i>why Cuddy.</i>

612
00:25:46,537 --> 00:25:48,838
Because they've been
talking about me.

613
00:25:48,906 --> 00:25:51,408
<i>She called me to check on the patient,</i>

614
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:53,243
which she never does
without a reason.

615
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,478
I asked why, and she said...

616
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:57,814
She's a barracuda attorney, House.

617
00:25:57,882 --> 00:26:00,050
These are the kind of patients
we like to keep happy.

618
00:26:00,117 --> 00:26:01,551
Right now the patient's lucky

619
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:03,853
if she can spell jurisprudence.

620
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:06,723
<i>Yeah, but when she gets that memory back,</i>

621
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:08,358
<i>which we are trying to make happen,</i>

622
00:26:08,426 --> 00:26:10,360
<i>she'll be able to spell lawsuit.</i>

623
00:26:10,428 --> 00:26:12,862
I'm just touching base.

624
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,799
Touching base.

625
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,401
Wilson used exactly
the same phrase.

626
00:26:18,469 --> 00:26:21,805
Colluding about me is
her favorite pastime.

627
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,940
Okay, you think they talked.

628
00:26:26,777 --> 00:26:29,679
How do you think that
conversation went?

629
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:36,219
I'm worried about House.

630
00:26:36,287 --> 00:26:38,354
Me too.

631
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:40,356
Couldn't you have waited?

632
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:43,026
It's way too early for
him to be on his own,

633
00:26:43,094 --> 00:26:44,761
back in the old apartment.

634
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:46,162
What makes you think
he can handle it?

635
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,398
I offered to find him a new place.

636
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,033
<i>You have to let him back into your condo.</i>

637
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:52,335
<i>Sam and I just got him out of the condo.</i>

638
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,204
<i>You know what House is like.
He's self-destructive.</i>

639
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:55,538
Without constant supervision,

640
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:57,640
he's gonna slide back into drugs.

641
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,243
If you're not watching him,
I've got to.

642
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:02,912
Yeah.

643
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,281
So they don't trust you.

644
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:07,650
They assume you'll fail.

645
00:27:07,718 --> 00:27:10,887
Are these their fears or yours?

646
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:17,227
Let's turn on the lights, Hmm?

647
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:19,762
In your brain.

648
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,233
Maybe they did talk
about you, but...

649
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,737
How do you know it
didn't happen like this?

650
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:29,539
I'm worried about House. Why?

651
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:31,174
It's the first time
he'll be on his own

652
00:27:31,242 --> 00:27:32,942
since Mayfield.

653
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,410
<i>Now you're being overprotective.</i>

654
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:35,945
<i>House doesn't need to be wrapped
in cotton wool.</i>

655
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:37,213
But you know that,

656
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,048
or you wouldn't have
asked him to move out.

657
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,217
Okay. I guess this
is really about me.

658
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,287
It's just... I feel like a jerk.

659
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:48,091
Sure, Sam and I are gonna want
to be on our own eventually,

660
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,093
<i>but I kind of sprang this on him.</i>

661
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:51,761
<i>The right way would have been</i>

662
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:53,630
<i>to just tell him to take as
long as he needed,</i>

663
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:55,465
<i>that there's no hurry.</i>

664
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:57,000
<i>So it's not what you did,</i>

665
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:58,801
but how you did it.

666
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:01,504
That matters in a friendship.

667
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:02,906
I need to fix this.

668
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:06,676
Why don't you talk to him
about moving back in?

669
00:28:06,744 --> 00:28:08,478
Just touch base.

670
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:12,415
We're having a consent
issue with the patient.

671
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,851
Wait a minute. Taub's not here.

672
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,953
Yeah, he is.

673
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:18,421
We're having a consent
issue with the patient.

674
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,123
What's Taub doing in
my imaginary version

675
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:21,824
of a scene with Wilson and Cuddy?

676
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:23,059
Your version needed to be ended,

677
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:24,394
'cause it's crap.

678
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:26,095
It's all sweetness and light and...

679
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:29,065
Faith that I'm gonna
choose the right path.

680
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:31,434
Yeah, that sounds like Wilson.

681
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:34,904
<i>I have as much evidence</i>
<i>for mine</i>

682
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:36,973
as you do for yours.

683
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,409
I know Wilson's your friend.

684
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:42,412
So he could be wondering
if he did right by you.

685
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:44,247
And I know he wouldn't
have asked you to move out

686
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:45,915
in the first place
unless he was convinced

687
00:28:45,983 --> 00:28:47,450
you could handle life on your own.

688
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:50,486
And I know that he and Cuddy
have gone behind my back before

689
00:28:50,554 --> 00:28:53,423
to strategize about
the House problem.

690
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,825
So there's truth in both versions.

691
00:28:55,893 --> 00:28:57,794
But you choose to
focus on the parts

692
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,562
that make you uncomfortable.

693
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,165
So...

694
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:10,306
Why are you and Wilson...

695
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,275
Friends?

696
00:29:14,945 --> 00:29:16,346
Do you think this friendship

697
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:18,581
is the best you can do?

698
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:21,451
Wilson is not a consolation prize.

699
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:23,686
There... You're defending him.

700
00:29:23,754 --> 00:29:24,821
And a minute ago,

701
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,656
he was skulking around
in the background

702
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:30,026
like some sort of
manipulative iago.

703
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:32,161
He's my friend.

704
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,397
So what do you value in him?

705
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:41,938
I can say whatever I want to him,

706
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:43,406
and he'll never leave.

707
00:29:43,474 --> 00:29:45,708
He's sort of leaving.

708
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:49,812
At least, he won't
be around as much...

709
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,016
Because he's putting Sam first.

710
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,018
For now.

711
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,452
After the divorce,

712
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,454
he'll probably ask
me to move in again.

713
00:29:58,522 --> 00:30:01,958
I take the long view.

714
00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:04,360
You say that to Wilson?
Are you kidding?

715
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,730
That's the kind of remark
that leads people to hate you.

716
00:30:10,868 --> 00:30:13,403
Uh, maybe you've been
right from the beginning.

717
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,973
Maybe this isn't about Wilson.

718
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,909
You say that now that I
finally agree with you?

719
00:30:19,977 --> 00:30:22,512
Do you just argue the
opposite of whatever I say?

720
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:24,947
I don't mean the Wilson thing
doesn't, uh, bother you,

721
00:30:25,015 --> 00:30:27,016
uh, but it sounds like he's
the closest you can come

722
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:28,518
to a safe relationship.

723
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:31,387
You'd have to do something
major to screw it up.

724
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:35,024
Um, what--what else have you
been involved in this week?

725
00:30:35,092 --> 00:30:39,595
What would you want to
punish yourself for?

726
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:42,398
I told you, I don't know.

727
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:47,670
Okay, um, let's approach
it from a different angle.

728
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:51,307
Have you gotten any other
people angry at you

729
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,477
over anything?

730
00:30:54,545 --> 00:30:56,212
Well, yeah.

731
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,614
That's why I called
it an ordinary week.

732
00:30:58,682 --> 00:31:01,584
Okay. Tell me about it.

733
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:08,441
<i>You'd be losing a part of your brain.</i>

734
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:09,824
It is my brain.

735
00:31:09,892 --> 00:31:12,127
Why is it not my right to consent?

736
00:31:12,194 --> 00:31:13,361
<i>I'm sorry, but...</i>

737
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:15,363
I'll take this to
court if necessary.

738
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:16,698
All right, Sidney's in no position

739
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:18,399
to make decisions about
herself right now.

740
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:19,934
She doesn't even know who she is.

741
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:21,703
I read your consent form,
and I understood it.

742
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,038
I want the surgery.
<i>Why wouldn't she?</i>

743
00:31:24,106 --> 00:31:25,440
Of course she's willing to risk

744
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,208
losing her memories permanently.

745
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:29,644
She has no idea how important
those memories are.

746
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:31,846
Does she even know what risk is?

747
00:31:31,914 --> 00:31:34,215
She's never lost anything.

748
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:36,417
Without the surgery,
she'll lose everything.

749
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:37,886
The prion infection

750
00:31:37,953 --> 00:31:40,188
will continue to advance and
destroy her whole brain.

751
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:43,057
Well, there has to be another way.

752
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,827
Please.

753
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:48,630
I'm speaking for my wife,

754
00:31:48,697 --> 00:31:50,632
the wife I lived
with for four years

755
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:53,334
<i>who isn't here and can't
defend herself.</i>

756
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,304
Dr. House, are you listening?

757
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,740
Well, you can stop arguing,

758
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:00,742
'cause it doesn't matter anymore.

759
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:03,711
Look at the variability
in the heart rate.

760
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,647
The s.E. Has spread
into the brain stem.

761
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:06,915
W-wherever it is,

762
00:32:06,982 --> 00:32:10,185
you--you can still cut it out.

763
00:32:10,252 --> 00:32:12,954
No. We can't cut the brain stem.

764
00:32:13,022 --> 00:32:15,323
This thing's moving too quickly.

765
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,659
Surgery's no longer an option,

766
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:19,360
which I guess means you've won.

767
00:32:19,428 --> 00:32:20,762
Congratulations.

768
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:24,332
Put in a pacer and start
her on chemo and radiation.

769
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,668
It won't cure her,
but it'll buy a couple weeks

770
00:32:26,735 --> 00:32:31,072
so she can find out who
she is before she dies.

771
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,575
<i>That was pretty rough.</i>

772
00:32:33,642 --> 00:32:35,877
<i>Do you always break the news to
your patients that way?</i>

773
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:38,613
<i>Or were you short-handing it for me?</i>

774
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:40,215
Husband was being an idiot.

775
00:32:40,282 --> 00:32:42,884
Well, he was asking for it.

776
00:32:42,952 --> 00:32:46,854
But, um, to punish him you
have to punish the wife too.

777
00:32:46,922 --> 00:32:48,823
Why--why did he make
you so angry, Hmm?

778
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:51,759
Because he didn't want
to cooperate with you?

779
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:56,497
He'd rather risk his wife's
life than their marriage.

780
00:32:56,565 --> 00:32:58,099
People's brains stop working

781
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,468
when they think they're gonna
lose someone they love.

782
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:03,504
Your leg hurt?

783
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:08,643
It's all right.

784
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:10,912
Okay.

785
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,914
Anyone else you pissed off?

786
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,924
50 bucks for the book.

787
00:33:22,992 --> 00:33:24,659
Forget it.

788
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:27,595
You paid $25. That's 100% return.

789
00:33:27,663 --> 00:33:28,896
That's what I paid.

790
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:30,398
But it's a rare surgical text,

791
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,001
nearly 100 years old-
plate's in mint condition.

792
00:33:33,068 --> 00:33:35,770
That book's worth several
thousand dollars.

793
00:33:35,838 --> 00:33:38,139
$2,000-- I'll write you a check.

794
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:39,474
Nice try.

795
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:41,042
Face it-- I had the wit

796
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,745
to recognize something
valuable when I saw it.

797
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:47,315
In the great darwinian race,
I get my just reward.

798
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:49,784
You become roadkill.

799
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:03,464
Yo, House, you want to
stop by the library?

800
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:06,267
'Cause I got a book to return.
Ta-ka-plow!

801
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,503
? Old Professor
tried to hoard/hog ?

802
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,039
? you can't stop alvie
with no guard-ass dog ?

803
00:34:11,106 --> 00:34:12,407
anyone see you?

804
00:34:12,474 --> 00:34:14,208
Yeah, prof saw me walking
down the driveway.

805
00:34:14,276 --> 00:34:16,044
He said the roses
need more fertilizer.

806
00:34:22,117 --> 00:34:24,052
I didn't know there was
a section of the brain

807
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,987
just for hope.

808
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:27,555
It's very, very tiny.

809
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:29,590
We used fluoroscopy to
guide pacemaker placement

810
00:34:29,658 --> 00:34:30,792
in the patient's heart.

811
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:32,527
Hello.

812
00:34:32,594 --> 00:34:33,961
Hello.

813
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:36,164
Rapidly progressive
dilated cardiomyopathy.

814
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:37,999
This isn't s.E.,

815
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,701
and whatever it is,
it's not just in her brain.

816
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:41,135
It's attacking her whole body.

817
00:34:41,203 --> 00:34:42,870
You work for House?
I guess we're teammates.

818
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:44,706
<i>Isn't that cool?</i>

819
00:34:44,773 --> 00:34:47,041
Hello.

820
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:48,710
Juan alvarez?

821
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:50,445
What the hell?

822
00:34:50,512 --> 00:34:52,880
<i>We're taking you into custody-
</i> <i>deportation order.</i>

823
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:54,115
I'm a citizen.

824
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:55,650
You're disrespecting Puerto Rico.

825
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,386
If you're a citizen,
why'd you miss your hearing?

826
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:02,824
You called them?

827
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:10,398
What's going on?

828
00:35:19,355 --> 00:35:20,822
We're trying to
stabilize her heart.

829
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,423
She's still tachy and hypotensive.

830
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:23,591
<i>Brain, heart,</i>

831
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:26,027
and rapidly progressing.

832
00:35:26,095 --> 00:35:28,596
<i>Endocarditis--slow-moving</i>
<i>infection in her heart</i>

833
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:30,098
<i>throws clots to her brain.</i>

834
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:33,801
I'm not talking to you.

835
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:35,770
How could you turn me in?

836
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:37,972
<i>Her extreme exercise suppresses
her immune system,</i>

837
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,308
allows the infection to smolder.

838
00:35:40,376 --> 00:35:44,145
<i>Or allows an old infection</i>
<i>to reactivate it--t.B.</i>

839
00:35:44,213 --> 00:35:45,980
Start her on a multidrug regimen.

840
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,648
I don't like you, House.

841
00:35:47,716 --> 00:35:49,550
I hate you.

842
00:35:49,618 --> 00:35:51,819
<i>Even I.V. Antibiotics will
take time to work.</i>

843
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:55,089
A general reminder--the use
of cell phones is prohibited.

844
00:35:55,157 --> 00:35:56,491
Give her the first dose

845
00:35:56,558 --> 00:35:58,693
directly into the lungs in the O.R.

846
00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:00,461
<i>Before the less gentle arrest
for contempt.</i>

847
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:02,430
Put her in an isolation
room with U.V. light.

848
00:36:02,498 --> 00:36:05,533
And get yourselves tested.
You've all been exposed.

849
00:36:08,837 --> 00:36:11,372
Docket number 4378.

850
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:17,678
<i>You are?</i>

851
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:20,381
I am Mr. alvarez's doctor.

852
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:29,157
Your honor, DNA evidence

853
00:36:29,224 --> 00:36:33,027
proving the matriarchal
lineage of Juan alvarez.

854
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,532
My mother's DNA was
still on that cross?

855
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,101
It could be.

856
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:42,537
You faked it?

857
00:36:45,307 --> 00:36:48,709
It wasn't just me.
You lied to them too!

858
00:36:48,777 --> 00:36:51,846
I'm better at it than you are.

859
00:36:51,914 --> 00:36:54,048
I'm gonna repaint your
whole apartment now,

860
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:56,284
<i>make the drapes match the carpet now!</i>

861
00:36:58,954 --> 00:37:00,221
Lungs sound wet.

862
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:01,355
<i>O-2 sats are dropping.</i>

863
00:37:01,423 --> 00:37:02,623
<i>May need to tube her.</i>

864
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:04,692
Grab some I.V. Furosemide.

865
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:10,798
Wait, wait. She's crashing.

866
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:13,634
<i>We need to get her on
a vent.</i>

867
00:37:22,177 --> 00:37:25,346
There's something on her ankle.

868
00:37:27,182 --> 00:37:29,550
<i>Tattoo.</i>

869
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:31,986
"Eddie would go.
" It's a surfing phrase.

870
00:37:32,054 --> 00:37:33,921
Must be from her earlier life.

871
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:36,057
She tried to get it removed,

872
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:38,693
but they only took off
the top layers of skin.

873
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,661
The ink is still in
the deeper layers.

874
00:37:40,729 --> 00:37:42,597
Set off an allergic reaction.

875
00:37:42,664 --> 00:37:44,165
<i>She was fine until she started</i>

876
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:45,700
<i>the long-distance running.</i>

877
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:48,102
The ultra-marathoning
modified her immune system,

878
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,071
set off the allergic reaction.

879
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:52,974
We did a full thickness skin graft,

880
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:55,710
and she'll be okay.

881
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:58,846
So you were right... In the end.

882
00:37:58,914 --> 00:38:02,149
<i>It was her past.</i>

883
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:04,285
<i>Did she get her memory back?</i>

884
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:07,188
<i>Not yet.</i>

885
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:08,689
<i>Will she?</i>

886
00:38:08,757 --> 00:38:10,892
No way to know.

887
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:12,860
<i>I think roses are my favorite.</i>

888
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:16,697
But I guess I told you
that at some point.

889
00:38:16,765 --> 00:38:18,666
I don't remember.

890
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:25,106
<i>He's treating her as though they just met.</i>

891
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:26,374
<i>He's courting her.</i>

892
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:29,577
Whose idea was that?

893
00:38:29,645 --> 00:38:31,612
He was doing the opposite
of everything he should.

894
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,214
Suddenly he's changed.

895
00:38:33,282 --> 00:38:35,283
<i>Taub thought it might-
</i> that was your idea.

896
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,151
And you asked me

897
00:38:37,185 --> 00:38:39,453
what I thought was
going on between them.

898
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:41,923
It's their relationship
that's on your mind.

899
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,225
That's why you've been
thinking about this case--

900
00:38:44,293 --> 00:38:46,027
relationships.

901
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:48,062
Lost one with Wilson,
gained one with alvie.

902
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,799
<i>Not exactly.</i>

903
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:53,734
Alvie?

904
00:39:11,153 --> 00:39:14,155
<i>You gonna tell me what the note said?</i>

905
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:20,561
Alvie was very grateful

906
00:39:20,629 --> 00:39:22,730
that I'd gotten him out of trouble.

907
00:39:22,798 --> 00:39:24,899
It allowed him to go stay
with his cousin in Phoenix

908
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,300
without worrying about immigration

909
00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:28,970
looking for him there.

910
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:31,639
You didn't think he was
gonna stay forever.

911
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:35,076
<i>No.</i>

912
00:39:35,143 --> 00:39:37,378
What happened next?

913
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:42,416
? ?

914
00:39:42,484 --> 00:39:44,452
<i>Nothing happened next.</i>

915
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:52,293
? ?

916
00:40:10,145 --> 00:40:13,547
That's all I got.

917
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:20,521
Relationships.

918
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:22,056
Bergman.

919
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:23,524
What do you want me to say?

920
00:40:23,592 --> 00:40:24,759
<i>I don't know.</i>

921
00:40:24,826 --> 00:40:26,327
<i>You're the one who said the thing-
-</i>

922
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:28,896
something about relationships

923
00:40:28,964 --> 00:40:31,399
made you go out and
provoke a fight.

924
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:35,703
Wilson and Sam have a relationship.

925
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:37,171
You're not thrilled about it.

926
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,273
They're happy.

927
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:42,176
Why should I screw that up?

928
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:44,278
Everyone's happy.

929
00:40:44,346 --> 00:40:47,615
Everyone's moving in together--

930
00:40:47,683 --> 00:40:49,550
Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and Lucas.

931
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:50,851
Even alvie's--

932
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:53,287
Cuddy and Lucas are
moving in together?

933
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:55,523
You didn't mention that.

934
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,692
They talked about moving
in together before.

935
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:59,960
It's not big news.

936
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:05,199
Cuddy...

937
00:41:10,872 --> 00:41:13,974
Cuddy.

938
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:18,546
<i>Approach to the acute abdomen...</i>

939
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:28,756
Written by Ernest t. Cuddy, m.D.

940
00:41:28,824 --> 00:41:31,225
<i>Any relation to your Cuddy?</i>

941
00:41:31,293 --> 00:41:35,162
Her great-grandfather.

942
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,631
I've had it for years...

943
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:40,735
Always meant to give it to
her for a special occasion.

944
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:43,437
Like her... Housewarming?

945
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:45,573
It's just a gift.

946
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,408
<i>A woman you care about</i>

947
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:49,076
is taking one step
further away from you

948
00:41:49,144 --> 00:41:51,212
and closer to someone else?

949
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:52,847
I-I think I can safely say

950
00:41:52,914 --> 00:41:55,583
<i>yes, it's significant if
you don't mention it.</i>

951
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,885
You were willing to punish
the husband of your patient

952
00:41:57,953 --> 00:42:01,489
because you identified with him.

953
00:42:01,556 --> 00:42:04,658
He was also losing
someone he loved.

954
00:42:04,726 --> 00:42:06,127
I'm not gonna go out
and get hammered

955
00:42:06,194 --> 00:42:07,628
because a woman I'm not even with

956
00:42:07,696 --> 00:42:08,696
is moving in with someone.

957
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:10,965
That'd be pathetic.

958
00:42:13,135 --> 00:42:16,170
To hell with this.

959
00:42:17,706 --> 00:42:19,273
When I first came to you,

960
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:22,243
I told you that I
wanted to be happy,

961
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:25,346
and I followed your advice.

962
00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:27,648
And instead, I'm just miserable.

963
00:42:27,716 --> 00:42:30,017
How is this working for me?

964
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:32,753
It takes time.

965
00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:35,322
For a year, I've done
everything you've asked,

966
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,225
and everybody else is happy.

967
00:42:38,293 --> 00:42:42,096
I run on my treadmill.
You just sit there and watch.

968
00:42:42,164 --> 00:42:44,365
You're a faith healer.

969
00:42:44,432 --> 00:42:47,668
You take advantage of
people who want to believe.

970
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:54,175
But there's nothing
in your bag of tricks.

971
00:42:55,644 --> 00:42:58,512
House...

972
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,982
Whatever the answer is,
you don't have it.
