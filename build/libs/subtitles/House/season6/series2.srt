for that in pure firepower.

Yeah, not that

Then what is it?
i don't know.

38

You can't quit.

I want to run the department.

64
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:16,334
You consider waiting

65
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,067
Before you start angling
for his job?

66
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,667
He's not dead or sentimental

00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,101
<i>not necessarily.</i>

68
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,134
Departments of diagnostic
medicine don't exist.

69
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:27,700
The only reason we have one
is because of house.

70
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,268
You reassigned us,

71
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,067
Kept us on payroll
for three months.

72
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:32,334
<i>you might as well

But house was a genius.

76

House was an egotistical,
pill-popping lawsuit magnet...

77
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:44,201
And a genius.

78
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:46,567
<i>and i worked with him longer

79
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,767

00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,901

00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,700
<i>no idea,
but he's gone.</i>

83
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,567
So how about we focus
on the medicine?

84
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:08,834
What?
you're the boss.

85
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:10,001
It's kind of sexy.

86
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,700
Here i thought
it was just the pants.

87
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:14,268
Uh, diabetic neuropathy?

88
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:17,034
Hba1c looks fine.

89
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:19,400
Could be hypothyroidism.

90
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:20,567
No fatigue
or weight gain.

91
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:22,368

<i>(taub)

93

94
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,001
No house,
the job still gets done.

95
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,134
And yet something's

00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:28,867
<i>i'm short.

00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,600
Crps isn't that well
understood, but--

102
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:42,901
I think
it's mercury poisoning.

103
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,400
I eat a ton of sushi.

104
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,201

It's pretty hard

00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,467
To give yourself
mercury poisoning,

109
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:54,433
And it doesn't usually present
solely with pain.

110
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,368
But it can.

118
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,234
You should check the rate

120

Why wouldn't i educate myself,

121
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:18,467
Crps came up
in my search too.

122
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:20,600
But i've never had
any skin discoloration,

123

151
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,301
He asked us to test his blood
for mercury.

152
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:03,334
It's unlikely,
but not impossible.

<i>it's also not

You expected
not to have mixed feelings?

164
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:31,500
I know it's the right call.

165
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,334

I don't think we can get
any more connected

00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:57,234
Without unzipping.

180
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,268
Okay.

181
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:00,767
So what does wilson
like to do?

182
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:08,067
Vince, i'm dr. foreman,
head of diagnostics.

183
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:10,268
So you must be
the genius' replacement.

184
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:13,167
I prefer to think of myself
as genius 2.0.

185
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:14,834
Your blood tests ruled out
mercury poisoning.

186
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,700

2.8.</i>

187

I also know
it's above normal.

189
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,901
I want mercury chelation.

190
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,634
Your level
isn't elevated enough

191
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,234
To produce your symptoms.

192
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:26,567
You can't know that
until we de-elevate it

193
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:27,800
And see if my pain improves.

194
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,400
<i>it's a judgment call.</i>

195

197
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,368
I want to try
spinal stimulation.

198
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:37,101
So, basically, you want
to shove a needle in my spine

199
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,634
Based on a glorified hunch.

200
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,800
I'll stick
with the chelation.

201
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:46,667
If you don't want to get better,
i think we're done.

202
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:49,834
What do you mean "done"?

203
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:51,901
You're not interested
in my medical opinion.

204
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,500
<i>i'll move on
to my next patient.</i>

205
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,001
You'll move on to a doctor
willing to run

206
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:58,134
All the unnecessary tests
and procedures you want.

207
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,934
Or you can stick around
and be cured.

208
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,500
Makes no difference to me.

209
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:08,234

i'm glad you changed your mind.

210

211
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,001
Dr. foreman basically
strong-armed me,

212
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:15,101
Which is impressive.

213
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,767

Analysis of the fluid
from vince's lungs

229

Shows the lung problem
is really a heart problem.

230

He's got a thickened
left ventricle.

231
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:56,634
When his heart sped up
during the procedure,

232
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:57,734
It jacked up the pressure
in his lungs,

233
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,467
Causing pulmonary edema.

234
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,534
Good thing i talked the patient

And proved he was wrong
about mercury poisoning.

Although vinegar could work.

My o-chem prof talked
about how, theoretically,

You shouldn't trust the results
of a hemoglobin a1c test

270

On a chronically acidotic
patient.

271
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:37,234
The acid in the blood
slows the reaction

272
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,401
Between the hemoglobin protein
and blood sugar.

273
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,401
<i>browning meat is the same
chemical process,</i>

274
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:45,167
Which means, it should also
be slowed by acid.

275
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:49,067
That actually
makes sense.

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,933
House...

352
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:54,701
I'm gonna miss you.

353
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,334
Lady, either kiss him
or leave.

354
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:00,734
We got work to do.

355
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,667
You just couldn't keep
your trap shut.

356
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:03,967
Make the damn gnocchi.

357
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:06,033
Bye.

358
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,967
I guess you're not in a hurry
to get back to the office.

359
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:18,434
And you are?

360
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,967
I'm not trying to avoid
my boyfriend.

361
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:28,967
I'm a lizard.
not an idiot.

362
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:31,401
You've been in a crappy mood
since we got in the car.

363
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:33,801
And you're completely okay
with being ordered around

364
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:38,267
By someone who 24 hours ago
was basically your equal?

365
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:39,933
Unlike you, i didn't expect
anything different.

366
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,868
The work part,
i can get used to.

367
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,868
He didn't ask me
to go to dinner.

368
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:47,100
He told me we were going.

369
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:49,434
He's never
done that before.

370
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:51,534
So even the score.

371
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:52,933
<i>go home tonight,</i>

372
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,067
Put on some heels,
and break him like a pony.

373
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:56,667
You'll feel much better.

374
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:59,567
What?

375
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:00,601
Wow, that's one

376
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:03,167
Big-ass bird.

377
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:04,768
[screeches]

378
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,067
Wow.

379
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:13,467
It's kind of amazing.

380
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,667
The way the wings move,
it's so real.

381
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,801
Get them off me!

382
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,167
I know what's wrong
with the patient.

383
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,467
I'm going to call
foreman.

384
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,401
Little help.

385
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:27,801
<i>(taub)
your partner said</i>

386
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:29,667
You studied birds
to improve the game animation.

387
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:30,868
Did you touch them?

388
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,234
Can't dissect
without touching.

389
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,933
It's the best way
to understand the anatomy.

390
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,434
It's also a good way
to contract an infection

391
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:36,601
Called psittacosis.

392
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:37,734
We spoke to dr. foreman.

393
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:39,234
He wants to start you
on antibiotics.

394
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,100
Does that infection
cause problems in the...

395
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43,567
Joystick area?

396
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:45,067
<i>i'm kind of stuck
in play mode.</i>

397
00:17:45,134 --> 00:17:47,868
Yes, we get it.
she's very, very pretty.

398
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:48,734
<i>it's not her.</i>

399
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,367
I mean, it was...

400
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:53,033
When she was here with her
boyfriend three hours ago.

401
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,801
You've had an erection
for three hours?

402
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,234
<i>at first,
it was just embarrassing,</i>

403
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,167
<i>but now it's really starting
to hurt.</i>

404
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,534
Will the antibiotics help?

405
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:04,401
I'm afraid not.
this isn't psittacosis.

406
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,334
(taub)
his erection persisted

407
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:11,234
Even with medication.

408
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:13,767
<i>we had to put in a surgical
shunt just to drain the blood.</i>

409
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,134
<i>you missed dinner.</i>

410
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:16,301
And a shunt doesn't require
both of you.

411
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:17,501
I'm dedicated.

412
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:18,733
<i>so the holy trinity:</i>

413
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,134
Heart, hands, hose.

414
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:21,234
<i>(taub)
could be guillain-barre.</i>

415
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,434
Not with normal
nerve conduction.

416
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,101
Thrombocytosis.

417
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,034
His platelet count
isn't that high.

418
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,468
Brain tumor
makes more sense.

419
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:30,767
[taub laughing]

420
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,167
I'm sorry.
i just realized...

421
00:18:33,234 --> 00:18:35,800
Joint pain and joint pain.

422
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:38,967
Honest, i wasn't laughing
because of the obvious tension

423
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,667
<i>between the two of you.</i>

424
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,301
Erection points
to a circulatory problem.

425
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:45,633
I'm with foreman.

426
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,967
It is possible
for a brain tumor to cause--

427
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:48,934
We're going
with thrombocytosis.

428
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,167
Okay.

429
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,301
<i>you're mad i didn't ask you
to dinner?</i>

430
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:57,700
How long
have we been dating?

431
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,000
It felt like an order.

432
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,800
Your tone of voice was--
my tone?

433
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,301
I'm under a little pressure
right now.

434
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:03,633
How about giving me
a break?

435
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,134
Look, this is tough
for both of us,

436
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:07,367
Except i haven't just gotten
a promotion.

437
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:08,967
So now you're jealous.

438
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:11,000
No. i'm just saying
don't complain

439
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,633
About the burdens of command
to your employees.

440
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,468
I was complaining
to my girlfriend.

441
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,301
<i>who are those guys?</i>

442
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,201
I have no idea.

443
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:27,700
(vince)
meet the competition.

444
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,468
Steve paulson.
neurology, st. mark's.

445
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:31,334
Nice to meet you.

446
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,201
<i>you called
another doctor?
lots of other doctors.</i>

447
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:34,534
Posted my symptoms
on the internet.

448
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,934
You guys are 0 for 2.

449
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,501
I thought i'd look
for some backup.

450
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:39,468
I can cure all your symptoms
with my papaya toxin cleanse.

451
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:42,234
Month's supply, $395.

452
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:45,367
Okay, that guy's an idiot.
that doesn't mean they all are.

453
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,334
Neither one of you have
privileges at this hospital.

454
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:48,534
Please leave...

455
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,700
Now.

456
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,468
<i>(dr. paulson)
uh, dr. foreman,
sorry for the intrusion,</i>

457
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:56,034
But, um, i noticed
you haven't done a head mri yet.

458
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:57,234
'cause he doesn't
need one.

459
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:58,633
I'm pretty sure
he's got a brain tumor.

460
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,568
<i>we considered that</i>

461
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,101
And concluded thrombocytosis
is more likely.

462
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,900
I'm starting him
on hydroxyurea.

463
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,167
His platelets don't seem
anywhere near high enough.

464
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:07,733
<i>if you took an image,
i'm sure you'll--</i>

465
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,468
There are no signs
of increased icp.

466
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:10,667
<i>i'm not delaying treatment.</i>

467
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:12,067
Looks like we need
a tiebreaker.

468
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:14,633
Dr. hadley,
what do you think?

469
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,334
I think both theories
have merit.

470
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,067
So brain tumor,

471
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,700
<i>otherwise you'd back
your boss/boyfriend.</i>

472
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:24,134
I want an mri.

473
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:28,867
Fine.
i'll set it up.

474
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,267
Great. you're up.
i need a taster.

475
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:41,867
<i>ragout with pork sausage,</i>

476
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:45,101
Beef thigh, no cream.

477
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:48,800
It's a little early.

478
00:20:56,234 --> 00:20:57,667
Did you even go to bed
last night?

479
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:59,401
Bed is for sissies,

480
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,034
Unless you're having sex,
in which case...

481
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:04,000
No, bed is still
for sissies.

482
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:07,134
Doesn't this seem
a little bit obsessive?

483
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:09,034
Should've been here
when i was butchering the ox.

484
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,501
<i>what do you expect?
i'm an addict.</i>

485
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:12,167
I turn everything up
to eleven.

486
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah. i thought you were trying
to tone that down.

487
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,967
No. i was trying to find
something i could set at eleven

488
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:18,267
Without blowing out
my eardrums.

489
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:20,267
Star anise
with caramelized onions.

490
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:23,201
The sulfur compounds
bring out the meat flavor.

491
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:28,700
I couldn't sleep
because of my leg.

492
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,134
It was either make ragout

493
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:32,267
Or go out on the street
looking to score.

494
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:38,367
<i>good choice.</i>

495
00:21:38,434 --> 00:21:41,034
So, so good.

496
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:52,067
He asked me a question.
i answered.

497
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:53,101
You told me
to make my own decisions.

498
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,468
I do, and you stab me
in the back.

499
00:21:54,534 --> 00:21:55,834
<i>i didn't even say
what i really thought.</i>

500
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
I hedged, and i don't like
that i hedged.

501
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,367
If i have
a legitimate opinion--

502
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:01,000
<i>express it
in private.</i>

503
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:04,267
In public, the team opinion
is your opinion.

504
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:05,667
<i>except the team opinion
is your opinion.</i>

505
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:07,267
That's my job.

506
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:08,534
<i>and what's mine,</i>

507
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,501
To lie when i'm asked
a direct question?

508
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:13,733
You would've done it
for house.

509
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,967
<i>maybe you just don't want me
to succeed.</i>

510
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,434
Maybe you just want
to kick me again

511
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:20,101
<i>for not asking you
to dinner.</i>

512
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:23,301
At least when house
was being an unbelievable jerk,

513
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:24,767
I could talk
to my boyfriend about it.

514
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,301
<i>i may be a jerk,</i>

515
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:27,700
But you're wrong.

516
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,267
Mri is clean.

517
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,268
That rules out thrombocytosis.

518
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,101
You're early.

519
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:42,934
<i>for what?</i>

520
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,633
I knew you'd show up here
complaining about foreman.

521
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,534
<i>thought you'd hold out
for another week at least.</i>

522
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,867
I showed up to ask
if you've seen thrombocytosis

523
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,667
With a platelet count
under--

524
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:55,134
I went crazy,
not stupid.

525
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:56,334
I leave,

526
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:58,633
Foreman embraces
his inner mugabe.

527
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,334
What's that?

528
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:02,667
<i>embryonali--
unhatched chicken egg.</i>

529
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:03,967
[utensil clatters]

530
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:05,534
I'm gonna suck out
some of the yolk

531
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,134
And replace it with ragout.

532
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:09,733
By the way, you can tell
the other lepers

533
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,301
That their absence
has been noted.

534
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:13,134
Cameron didn't come by?

535
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:14,633
Daddy's little co-dependent

536
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,234
Is all grown up.

537
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:18,667
Making room
for daddy's hot bisexual

538
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,067
<i>with boyfriend problems.</i>

539
00:23:20,134 --> 00:23:24,468
It's not a problem.
it's, um...

540
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay.
it's a problem.

541
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:28,700
I mean, i get it.
the patient's a nightmare.

542
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:32,468
He posted his case online.
it--you know foreman.

543
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:34,201
You know the situation.

544
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:35,867
<i>how can i get him
to tone it down?</i>

545
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:37,101
Stop being a coward

546
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,401
<i>for one thing.</i>

547
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:39,800
He's the one who's afraid
of failure.

548
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:41,034
<i>at a job that no one before me
has ever done.</i>

549
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:43,600
His fears are justified.

550
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,534
You're just afraid
of giving him control over you,

551
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,067
<i>which might work at home.</i>

552
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,034
It makes it almost impossible
for him to do his job.

553
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:52,101
Pass me
those crackers.

554
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:54,633
You're saying
this is all my fault?

555
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,767
I'm saying...

556
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,468
<i>that you would be happier</i>

557
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:02,600
If you learned
when it's okay to give in.

558
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:03,633
<i>what?</i>

559
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,000
You just suggested
that i give in

560
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:07,633
So that i can be happy.

561
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,800
What did they do to you
in there?

562
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:11,401
Taste this.

563
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:23,667
<i>mmm. good.</i>

564
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,000
This might be the best thing
i've ever eaten.

565
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,900
And, yes, i'm including
what you're thinking of now.

566
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:37,767
You are an amazing cook!

567
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:41,334
I know.

568
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:45,301
And yet, my leg hurts.

569
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:47,067
Fire her.

570
00:24:47,134 --> 00:24:48,534
[chuckles]
i'm not gonna fire her.

571
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,667
Then stop being
such a wuss.

572
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:50,867
I'm not being a wuss.

573
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:53,034
Challenging you
is part of her job.

574
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:54,834
But when she does it,
you take it personally.

575
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,468
So you're saying
this is my fault?

576
00:24:57,534 --> 00:25:00,000
I was trying to bury it
a little, but, yeah.

577
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,468
You got to eliminate
either the challenge

578
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:02,834
Or the reaction.

579
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,367
Or we could stick
with my original plan.

580
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:08,367
We get drunk and talk
about how girls are lame.

581
00:25:08,434 --> 00:25:09,934
Yeah.

582
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,401
This problem will go away
on its own.

583
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,900
It's 8:00
in the morning.

584
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:25,301
Coffee ice cream.

585
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:28,468
<i>no frittata?
no bombolini?</i>

586
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:29,834
Started thinking
about what you said,

587
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,134
About me obsessing.

588
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:33,101
Started obsessing
about obsessing.

589
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,934
Decided to take a day off.

590
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You were enjoying cooking.

591
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,934
How like a man

592
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,301
To think that i enjoy slaving
over a hot stove all day

593
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:43,000
While you're off
banging secretaries.

594
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:45,733
You said it was keeping
your mind off the pain.

595
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,633
<i>that was before i discovered
the biggest loser marathon</i>

596
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,000
On cable.

597
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:51,867
I like to pretend
they can see me eating.

598
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:54,301
And your leg?

599
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:55,867
It's fine.

600
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,067
My leg's killing me.

601
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:04,633
Cooking helped for a while.

602
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,167
I guess i got bored.

603
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:07,667
My leg
started hurting again.

604
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,900
Then i got worried,
and that made the pain worse.

605
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,501
What are you worried about?

606
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:14,501
That nothing's gonna help.

607
00:26:14,568 --> 00:26:17,134
<i>that i end up
in the very dark place.</i>

608
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:21,867
I'm fine...

609
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:23,468
Just not happy.

610
00:26:23,534 --> 00:26:24,900
<i>i didn't let you out
because you were happy.</i>

611
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:26,167
I let you out,
because i believe

612
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:27,468
You had the skills
to cope with that.

613
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:30,700
<i>you tried one thing.
it didn't work.</i>

614
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:32,967
So move on.

615
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:33,900
<i>write.
play chess.</i>

616
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,201
What if nothing works?

617
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:36,733
<i>what if nothing
gives me more</i>

618
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,867
Than a few days
before my brain

619
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:39,367
Starts looking
for the next fix,

620
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:42,334
Before my leg feels like
someone's shoving nails into it?

621
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,134
What do i do then?

622
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:47,834
If nothing in the world
can hold your interest,

623
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,401
Uh, we'll deal with that
when we get to it.

624
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:54,367
<i>but you have to trust me,
and you have to be patient.</i>

625
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,834
I brought you a doughnut.

626
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,633
The florist was closed.

627
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,934
I'll get a vase
and put it in water.

628
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:15,201
You know
i'm sorry, right?

629
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:18,501
I'm sorry too.

630
00:27:18,568 --> 00:27:21,934
Do you think, um...

631
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
We could start over?

632
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:26,000
That's a fantastic idea.

633
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,134
We're gonna be late.

634
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:35,767
Your boss won't mind.
[laughs]

635
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:39,600
[pager beeping]

636
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,134
No way.

637
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:45,401
His lymph nodes blew up.

638
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:47,101
He's been treated
for thrombocytosis,

639
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,434
<i>but there's been
no change.</i>

640
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:51,167

641
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,134
<i>i'm adding this to my list
of symptoms.</i>

642
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:54,067
That didn't work
last time.

643
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:55,401
Because i didn't think
big enough.

644
00:27:55,402 --> 00:27:56,402

his facial swelling.

647
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:52,134
Swollen lymph nodes
rule out thrombocytosis.

How did so many people
get my personal email?

649
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,967
The internet

<i>lymph enlargement

651
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,667
You were saying?

652
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:05,900
No point in treating the symptom
and not the disease.

653
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:09,234
Your stunt generated
quite a few responses.

654
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:10,334
Let's take a look.

655
00:29:10,401 --> 00:29:11,700
I'm way ahead of you.

656
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:13,600
Paraneoplastic syndrome
secondary to spinal tumor.

657
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:15,434
No. no hypercalcemia.

658
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:17,167
No muscle spasms
or incontinence.

659
00:29:17,234 --> 00:29:19,334
You are possessed
by the biblical demon "legion."

660
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:20,401
<i>(thirteen)
no, no jumping off a cliff</i>

661
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:21,434
In a herd of pigs.

662
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:22,534
Otherwise it did fit.

663
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Graves' disease.

664
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:25,167
No. thyroid levels
are normal.

665
00:29:25,234 --> 00:29:27,134
You want us to spend
the next few days shooting down

666
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:28,934
Every theory in the world,
or can we do our jobs

667
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,167
And come up
with one that works?

668
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:32,334
I want you to test me
for amyloidosis.

669
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:34,201
That your professional
opinion?

670
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:35,700
<i>it's the wisdom of crowds.</i>

671
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,733
Studies show the collective
decision of a group

672
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,434
Can be more accurate
than any individual's decision.

673
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:42,600
I went through my emails.
amyloidosis got the most votes.

674
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,401
If you had amyloidosis,

675
00:29:44,468 --> 00:29:46,700
There'd be speckling
on your cardiac ultrasound.

676
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:49,334
In 100% of cases?

677
00:29:49,401 --> 00:29:51,101
Fine.

678
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,633
I'll make you a deal.

679
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,700
We'll do a kidney biopsy
to test for amyloidosis.

680
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:56,134
When it comes back negative,

681
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:57,201
<i>you pull your case
off of the internet</i>

682
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:58,700
<i>and retract the reward.</i>

683
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:02,167
It's either that,
or i don't test you at all.

684
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,267
Deal.

685
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:17,568
If you wanted a quickie,
you should've called ahead.

686
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,934
I'm a mess.

687
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,568
Came home for lunch.

688
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:23,934
You have lunch with cuddy
on tuesdays.

689

She was busy.

690
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,700
And you are checking up
on me.

691

<i>is that my laundry?</i>

693
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:36,967
You were running out of socks
for me to borrow.

694
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:39,700
You got plenty
of underwear, though.

695
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:41,367
I'm fine.

696
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:42,700
You said that
this morning.

697
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,934
And consistency
proves what?

698

in the renal endothelium</i>

702
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:07,733
Consistent with amyloidosis.

703
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,967
The internet was right.

704
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,834
Start him
on dexamethasone.

705
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,267
<i>already done.</i>

706
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:14,800
<i>this may not be
the best time for this...</i>

707
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:18,633
But i quit.

708
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,101
I got an offer to join
a friend's surgical practice.

709
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:23,967
Um, you don't generally
get an offer

710
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:25,000
<i>unless you're looking
for one.</i>

711
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:26,334
I put out some feelers

712
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:28,468
When i found out house
wasn't coming back.

713
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:30,134
I lobbied to keep
the department open

714
00:31:30,201 --> 00:31:31,534
So you could keep
your job.

715
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,834
Yes. that was incredibly
altruistic of you.

716
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:41,534
It's nothing personal.

717
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,867
Actually, i think
you're doing pretty well.

718
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:48,967
But i came here to work
with house.

719
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,600
He's a jerk.

720
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,401
We'll be fine
without him.

721
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:01,267
Do you know how many resumes
we get every day

722
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:03,034
Without even asking?

723
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:06,134
Might be a few less
after cuddy shuts us down.

724
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:09,101
The case got solved
under your watch.

725
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:12,867
Does it really matter
how it happened?

726
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:15,434
It matters.

727
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:20,468
What if i'm just not ready
for this job?

728
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,367
Okay, you're sad.

729
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:28,733
I could tell you the story
about me and my roommate

730
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,967
At sarah lawrence.

731
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:32,800
Okay.

732
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:37,967
Her name was lindsey,

733
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:41,834
And she was a cheerleader
from iowa.

734
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:46,367
I broke my toilet
this morning.

735
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,568
I'll get my tools.

736
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:51,834
I blocked the intake valve

737
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,234
So i could collect
some of house's urine.

738
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:55,967
<i>cuddy,
he was barely limping.</i>

739
00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:57,434
What did the lab say?

740
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:58,767
<i>the urine was clean
for vicodin.</i>

741
00:32:58,834 --> 00:32:59,867
<i>it did, however,</i>

742
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:02,401
Contain strange
epithelial cells.

743
00:33:02,468 --> 00:33:03,767
Further analysis showed

744
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:06,234
They were
from a labrador retriever.

745
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:09,667
Damn.
[pen thuds]

746
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:12,468
He's using.

747
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:34,700
[breathing heavily]

748
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:02,867

00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:05,201

750
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,167
[explosion]

751
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:45,334
No. no.

752
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:48,867
Vince. vince.

753
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:51,434
Vince, relax.

754
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:53,101
It's dr. foreman.

755
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,134
[chirping]

756
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:15,867
[screeches]

757
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,700
Kill it!

758
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:21,700
Kill it!
no! no!

759
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:24,434
I don't have my blaster!

760
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:25,867
[screeches]

761
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,800
He's hallucinating
'cause he's burning up.

762
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:30,801
***

763
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,434
<i>(thirteen)
the antipyretics didn't work.</i>

764
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:41,401
Hopefully the cold tub
will get his temp down.

765
00:35:41,468 --> 00:35:43,501
Maybe we should see
if anyone's sent in other ideas.

766
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:45,267
Maybe the reward money
attract--

767
00:35:45,334 --> 00:35:47,067
No. i'm not letting
anyone else jerk us around.

768
00:35:47,134 --> 00:35:48,967
The masses were wrong
about amyloidosis.

769
00:35:49,034 --> 00:35:50,733
They don't know
about the fever.

770
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,334
I'm going with light-chain
deposition disorder.

771
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,501
You okay with that?

772
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:57,633
Yes.

773
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:07,367
<i>(foreman)
we think you have a disease</i>

774
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:09,201
Called lcdd.

775
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,468
It causes protein
to build up in your organs.

776
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:14,201
You think?

777
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:16,867
We can't definitely confirm
the diagnosis.

778
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,367
<i>and our only chance
of beating this</i>

779
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:21,834
Would be to start you
on high-dose chemotherapy.

780
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,334
<i>but i do have to warn you</i>

781
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:26,101
<i>that in your condition,
it might kill you.</i>

782
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:31,367
Do you want me to get you
some more information?

783
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:35,434
You're my doctor.

784
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:37,234
I trust you.

785
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:40,101
No, you don't.

786
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:41,534
<i>you're scared,</i>

787
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,468
<i>and you don't want
to make this decision.</i>

788
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:54,700
My career is riding
on this case...

789
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:56,301
<i>nowhere near as important</i>

790
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:59,733
As your life.

791
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,867
But i think the best shot
for both of us

792
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:06,101
<i>is to treat for lcdd.</i>

793
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:07,600
Okay.

794
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:11,534
<i>all right, let's get you
out of this tub</i>

795
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,101
<i>and into chemo.</i>

796
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,867
<i>(wilson)
we know you're back
on vicodin.</i>

797
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,934
No. the only thing you know
is that i'm a genius

798
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,101
Who got a dog
to pee in your toilet.

799
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,967
You don't know how i did it
or, more interestingly,

800
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:29,301
Where i peed.

801
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:31,367
House, you've spent the last
three months--

802
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:33,067
<i>et tu, butte?</i>

803
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:34,234
You got no reason
to be here.

804
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:35,501
He's the one
i was jerking around.

805
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:36,568
<i>(wilson)
why is your leg better?</i>

806
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:38,201
Ow. it hurts.

807
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:40,067
<i>please go away now.</i>

808
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:41,301
<i>if you really think
i'm using,</i>

809
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:42,667
How about asking me
before taking a wrench

810
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:43,667
To your plumbing?

811
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,034
House, you're an addict.

812
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:46,867
You can't be surprised
if we can't take you

813
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,101
<i>at your word.</i>

814
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:49,700
Fine. let's get you
some proof.

815
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:53,934
Hide your eyes, ladies.

816
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,234
House.

817
00:37:55,301 --> 00:37:56,134
You too.

818
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,800
My godson
made me that mug.

819
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:04,834
<i>if the lab says
that this is retriever too,</i>

820
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,134
Please let me know
right away.

821
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,568
It'd explain
my overwhelming desire

822
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:08,900
To wipe my butt
on your carpet.

823
00:38:13,034 --> 00:38:15,101
Thank you for dragging me
into this.

824
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:37,501
Stop the chemo.
he's got fabry's disease.

825
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,834
He was in the tub
for an hour.

826
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,633
His fingers should have pruned,
but they didn't.

827
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,267
Already stopped chemo
and confirmed fabry's.

828
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:46,167
<i>i'm glad you both agree,</i>

829
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:47,600
But could somebody
loop me in here?

830
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:51,101
We assumed the deposits
in your kidneys were proteins,

831
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,267
<i>but they were fats.</i>

832
00:38:52,334 --> 00:38:53,434
<i>fabry's makes them build up</i>

833
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:55,434
In your organs,
choke your nerves,

834
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,934
Keep your fingers
from pruning in water.

835
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,700
It's chronic
but manageable.

836
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:00,700
How'd you figure it out?

837
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,767
Iodine mumps.

838
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:10,267
His lymph nodes swelled up
after the head c.t.

839
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:12,568
We thought it was a new symptom,
but it wasn't.

840
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:14,234
It was a reaction
to the contrast.

841
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:16,468
Iodine mumps takes lymph nodes
off the table.

842
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:18,867
Remove that symptom...

843
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:21,167
And that just came to you?

844
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:26,034
I looked through
the online responses again.

845
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:28,468
Someone posted it
this morning.

846
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,633
Heard cuddy made it official.

847
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,167
<i>department's yours.
congrats.</i>

848
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:53,234
I'm sorry.

849
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:55,301
I went behind your back.

850
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:59,000
<i>on a scale of 1 to 10,
how mad are you?</i>

851
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:00,633
A 7.

852
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,867
And that's stupid.

853
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,867
You did the right thing.

854
00:40:05,934 --> 00:40:07,633
It's my fault you thought
you had to go behind my back.

855
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,267
I should've stood up
to you.

856
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:11,134
But you didn't 'cause
you didn't want to fight again.

857
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:18,167
It's our first case.
it'll take time to adjust.

858
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:23,800
What if by the time
we get adjusted,

859
00:40:23,867 --> 00:40:25,600
We don't like
each other anymore?

860
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:27,600
That's not gonna happen.

861
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:29,000
You sure?

862
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:30,301
'cause ever since
i took this job,

863
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:31,867
We've been making
each other miserable.

864
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,900
I really don't think
this is gonna work.

865
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,434
You're breaking up
with me?

866
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:48,633
No.

867
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,900
The other night

868
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:53,201
When i thought i was done,
you were there.

869
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:55,067
I need you.

870
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,800
I don't want
to lose you.

871
00:41:01,201 --> 00:41:03,501
Why are you...?

872
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,134
You're firing me.

873
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:18,967
I'm sorry.

874
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:27,000
I slipped.

875
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,767
You took vicodin?

876
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:38,334
$25,000.

877
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:42,167
I solved
my old team's case.

878
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:44,334
<i>i was about
to take the pills.</i>

879
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,600
I went online.

880
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:47,501
I found people posting
medical problems,

881
00:41:47,568 --> 00:41:49,568
And...

882
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:53,201
My leg stopped hurting.

883
00:41:53,267 --> 00:41:57,034
Oh.

884
00:41:57,101 --> 00:42:00,534
Oh?

885
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,334
I'm supposed
to be changing my life.

886
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:03,468
<i>this is not a change.</i>

887
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:04,934
Well, maybe i was wrong.

888
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,367
Says the guy making sand castles
in my brain.

889
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:09,834
We need to keep you
from using.

890
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,568
Taking your job away,
the medical puzzles,

891
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:13,534
<i>nearly drove you
back to it.</i>

892
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,967
Maybe diagnostic medicine

893
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:19,034
Is the key
to keeping you clean.

894
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:24,234
So you're okay with me
going online, solving cases?

895
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:28,767
No. you can't sit all day
in a room by yourself.

896
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:31,468
<i>isolation
fosters depression.</i>

897
00:42:31,534 --> 00:42:33,267
The hospital is part
of my old life.

898
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:36,134
<i>if i go back,
i might become...</i>

899
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:38,767
Who i was before,
pills and all.

900
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:40,201
<i>that's a possibility.</i>

901
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,934
But could be...

902
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,434
The only thing worse
for you

903
00:42:44,501 --> 00:42:46,201
Than going back
to diagnostic medicine

904
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:49,401
Is not going back.

905
00:43:00,334 --> 00:43:03,034
Guess we're gonna find out.

906
00:43:03,035 --> 00:43:04,035
