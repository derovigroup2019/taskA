Okay, let's say
all his symptoms are real.

183
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,105
Explain how one of them
suddenly went away

184
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,340
without using the words
"virgin" or "mary."

185
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:30,176
If the pleural effusion's
caused by something systemic,

186
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,746
it could explain
his other two symptoms.

187
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,147
And so whether you
believe him or not,

188
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,949
all we have to figure out
is what caused the pe.

189
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,617
ER ruled out infection.

190
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,819
Eosinophil count
ruled out parasites.

191
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,322
A medication he's not
telling us about.

192
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,823
You really don't
trust this guy, do you?

193
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:47,093
I don't even trust the ER.

194
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:49,095
Let's rule out
infections ourselves.

195
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:50,764
Tap his lungs,
send cultures,

196
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,599
run cytology for cancer,
and check his blood pressure.

197
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,000
We already--

198
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:56,302
this time, talk about
nuptials while you do it.

199
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,871
Check his home
for everything else.

200
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,306
He just moved in with his
fiancee three months ago.

201
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,176
Toxic exposure could take
longer than that to manifest.

202
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,812
You check his love nest.

203
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,814
You two check
his swinging bachelor pad.

204
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,582
That somebody else
now lives in?

205
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,484
I assume so.

206
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,323
Not the glass. No!

207
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,491
[Shattering glass]

208
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,560
[Sighs]

209
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:26,466
The place
looks like...1960s?

210
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,067
Could have lead paint.

211
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,470
You think
a 27-year-old has pica?

212
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:31,938
If it gets us out of here

213
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:36,009
before the owner
comes back, yes.

214
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,211
What'd you tell
that cute physio?

215
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,114
That I changed my mind.

216
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,016
No, you didn't.

217
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,851
You're more nervous
than usual.

218
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,988
Because this B and E
has actual B.

219
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,224
Wha...

220
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,426
That's
a suspended ceiling.

221
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,931
What are you doing?

222
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,699
I want to see
what's above it.

223
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:03,870
More ceiling.

224
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:07,574
Made of 40-year-old
acoustic tile.

225
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,175
Asbestosis.
I like it.

226
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:10,577
I'll be in the car.

227
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,846
<i>(Cotter)</i>
<i>What the hell?</i>

228
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,447
Uh, it's okay.

229
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:15,481
We're doctors.

230
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:16,816
Nobody was home, so--

231
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,318
well, I'm calling
the police.

232
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:21,054
Do you know Ted Taylor?
He used to live here.

233
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,689
Yeah. What about him?

234
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,224
He's our patient
at Princeton Plainsboro.

235
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,692
Is he okay?

236
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,860
We think he may
have asbestosis

237
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,528
from your ceiling tiles.

238
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:29,929
They're not asbestos. I had
'em checked when I moved in.

239
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,798
How sick is he?

240
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:33,132
Is he a friend of yours?

241
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,500
<i>(Cotter)</i>
<i>He was.</i>

242
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:38,805
Actually, he was my boyfriend
for three years.

243
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,534
I'm not gay.
<i>(House)</i>
<i>Really?</i>

244
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,402
'Cause it would certainly
explain the cold feet.

245
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,337
Oh, and the boyfriend.

246
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:49,239
So you're bisexual?

247
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:51,041
No, I'm straight.

248
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,776
<i>Cotter, the guy you met,</i>
<i>he's gay.</i>

249
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:57,117
He had a crush on me.
I left.

250
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:58,785
After three years?
Well, it's possible.

251
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:00,120
It doesn't mean you're gay

252
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:01,521
just 'cause the guy
you're sleeping with is.

253
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:02,956
We weren't
sleeping together.

254
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,290
What's this got to do
with anything?

255
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:06,359
Lung tap turned up
mononucleosis.

256
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:07,861
ER doesn't routinely
test for it.

257
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:09,395
It explains the pe

258
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:11,564
and can be virtually
asymptomatic.

259
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:13,666
So we got to wondering, how
does a 27-year-old get mono?

260
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:15,735
You're a little old
for the kissing disease,

261
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:17,937
unless your immune system
is compromised.

262
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,773
If there's been
any unprotected sex,

263
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,174
we'll need to test
for HIV.

264
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:23,376
There's been no sex
of any kind.

265
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:27,347
Okay. I'll go test
your fiancee for HIV.

266
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:28,848
Is she the curious sort?

267
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,583
Wait.

268
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,855
There may have been
some contact,

269
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:37,557
but I'm not gay.

270
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,759
Sodomy,
one of the top ten

271
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:41,427
most common household
accidents.

272
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:42,862
I did a lot
of stupid things,

273
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,164
but I turned my life
around.

274
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:45,665
I'm as straight
as any of you.

275
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,967
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to believe me.</i>

276
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:52,205
I'm just saying
you can test me...

277
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:54,174
As long as you
don't tell Nicole.

278
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:57,577
What business is it
of hers?

279
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:58,778
(Chase)
I don't see anything wrong

280
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:00,113
with him marrying
a straight woman.

281
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:01,948
How about, it'll make
them both miserable?

282
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:04,150
Just like
most straight marriages.

283
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:06,319
He's got the right to life,
liberty, and unhappiness,

284
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:08,254
like the rest of us.

285
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:10,123
Absolutely no reason
to look at me.

286
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:11,491
<i>(Chase)</i>
<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>it's a great choice.</i>

287
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,226
Just saying
it's his choice.

288
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:15,328
It has to be hers as well,
which it can't be

289
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:17,096
as long as she doesn't
know he's gay.

290
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:18,298
Which is how
it's gonna stay

291
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:19,766
since we have no right
to tell her.

292
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:21,634
Like you've never
bent the rules.

293
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:24,103
You date guys.
You date girls.

294
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:26,306
I assume at some point,
you're gonna make a choice.

295
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:28,341
I don't lie
about who I am.

296
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:29,576
Patients lying never
bothered you before.

297
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:30,810
Patients weren't lying

298
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:31,845
about their
sexual orientation before.

299
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:33,580
So you're only judgmental

300
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:34,881
when it gets personal.

301
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:37,016
Does it bother me
that people hurt others

302
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:38,651
because they're too weak
to face the truth?

303
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:40,520
Yeah.
Sorry about that.

304
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:42,689
Tell me she's not
looking at me.

305
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:51,164
He's negative?
Yep.

306
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:54,000
Looks like being gay
didn't make him sick.

307
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:58,004
So maybe
being straight did.

308
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:01,441
The test was negative.
No HIV.

309
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:02,675
I told you.

310
00:13:02,743 --> 00:13:04,711
What you didn't tell us

311
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:06,713
is how you turned
your life around.

312
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,648
It can be pretty hard.
It was.

313
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:10,650
Downright impossible
on your own.

314
00:13:10,718 --> 00:13:12,185
I talked to some people.

315
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:14,320
It was more than just talk,
wasn't it?

316
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:19,759
I know this is
personal stuff.

317
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:22,462
I'm here to help you,
not out you.

318
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,801
I had therapy.

319
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:30,436
Conversion therapy.

320
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:33,806
Went to a camp for three weeks
of intensive rehabilitation.

321
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:37,443
They injected him with emetics
while he watched gay porn.

322
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:38,678
Apomorphine?

323
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:40,847
Or lithium chloride
or cyclophosphamide.

324
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:41,948
He doesn't know.

325
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:43,283
And when that
didn't work,

326
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,351
<i>they shot him up</i>
<i>with male hormones.</i>

327
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:46,953
A chemical assault like that
could explain the pe.

328
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:49,255
And the ECT
explains the rest.

329
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:52,191
They gave him electroconvulsive
therapy to make him straight?

330
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:54,227
To zap the fabulous
right out of him.

331
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,162
Neural damage accounts
for the aphasia.

332
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,864
ECT doesn't cause
neural damage.

333
00:13:57,932 --> 00:13:59,165
Unless it was done

334
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:02,201
at Dr. Liberace's
he-man quackery camp.

335
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,736
Run an EEG.

336
00:14:03,804 --> 00:14:07,273
See if they straightened him
or just scrambled him.

337
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:20,887
Sorry.
I completely forgot.

338
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:24,424
My wife just started a ceramics
class Tuesdays at 8:00.

339
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:26,459
It's a half-hour drive
from here.

340
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:29,829
She won't be back
till 10:30.

341
00:14:29,897 --> 00:14:32,865
She's taking it
with her girlfriend marly.

342
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:35,435
She hopes to make
a tea service.

343
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:38,771
You want to call her?

344
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,574
No need.
I already texted her.

345
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:45,878
And here she is now.

346
00:14:45,946 --> 00:14:50,249
I think you're still
seeing the physio.

347
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:52,952
You've got a backup suit
in your car.

348
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,288
Don't want to be
bringing home da stank.

349
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:57,190
Okay, yes, you're right,
about everything.

350
00:14:57,257 --> 00:14:58,358
But please, House.
Don't tell her.

351
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:00,727
Hi, Rachel.
Hi, Dr. House.

352
00:15:00,794 --> 00:15:01,961
I didn't know
you'd be here.

353
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:04,063
Hi, honey.
Got your text, obviously.

354
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:05,865
I'm just leaving.

355
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:08,167
I've got
a ceramics class.

356
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:10,703
Really?
<i>I love it.</i>

357
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:12,972
Even managed to talk Chris
into signing up for one.

358
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,640
Of course, he's in
the beginners' class.

359
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,043
You're in
a ceramics class?

360
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:18,478
Friday nights, right?

361
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:20,613
Friday nights.
Sounded like fun.

362
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,684
You should join Chris'.

363
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:26,552
You know, I should.

364
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,855
Well, gotta go.

365
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:31,224
Making a tea service.

366
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,036
Hi, I must have
fallen asleep in the lounge.

367
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,270
What are they doing?

368
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:45,338
An EEG.

369
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:47,140
What's it for?

370
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,008
We're looking for
neurological damage

371
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:49,942
that could have caused
his symptoms.

372
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,444
Damage from what?

373
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:53,513
A head trauma.

374
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,415
He had an accident?

375
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:56,749
It wasn't an accident.

376
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:58,618
It was
before he met you.

377
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:01,120
Well, what happened?
Was he hospitalized?

378
00:16:01,188 --> 00:16:03,489
You should ask him
about it.

379
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:08,161
They have the results.

380
00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:17,403
Everything looks normal.

381
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:19,739
Look at this.

382
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:20,973
Beta waves are spiking.

383
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:21,974
What's that mean?

384
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,509
I'm not sure.

385
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:26,112
(Chase)
He's coding. Crash cart.

386
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,980
What's happening to him?

387
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:29,582
He's having
a heart attack.

388
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,920
(Chase)
Charging. Clear.

389
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,729
EKG showed
no abnormalities.

390
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,808
So what caused
the arrest?

391
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,876
<i>(House)</i>
<i>Four ways to stop a heart.</i>

392
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:44,279
Electrical problems,
restricted blood flow,

393
00:16:44,346 --> 00:16:45,413
blood
where it shouldn't be,

394
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,615
shocks, blocks,
or bleeds.

395
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:48,983
I think that's
three things.

396
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,285
And cheating.

397
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,121
Oh, no. Sorry.

398
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:54,456
That's how
you break a heart.

399
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:58,927
I found a ceramics class
in Trenton on Friday nights

400
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:02,363
that was full
so my wife couldn't join me.

401
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:06,034
Ep study ruled out shocks.

402
00:17:06,102 --> 00:17:09,137
Now you just have to find
some pottery by Taub.

403
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:10,738
The lamer it looks,
the better.

404
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:12,140
<i>(Foreman)</i>
<i>So we'll do an angio</i>

405
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,441
to see if it's
blocks or bleeds.

406
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:14,442
You should be a doctor.

407
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:25,920
I'm gonna check out this
new lesbian bar tonight.

408
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:28,189
Your life is awesome.

409
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,592
You want to come?

[Click]

412
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:43,271
I was telling
a 33-year-old woman

413
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:44,539
that she has breast cancer.

414
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,175
No, you weren't.
How do you know?

415
00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:48,676
Because if you were,
you'd need to see

416
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:51,412
the pain in her eyes so she
could see the concern in yours.

417
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,715
Why are you setting me up
on dates with my team?

418
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,917
Taub asking me out
was quirky,

419
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:58,253
but Thirteen doing it
is a barking cat.

420
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,021
I'm doing it to help you.

421
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:00,955
By setting me up
with a hottie

422
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:02,857
that I can't sleep with?

423
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:04,192
And Thirteen?

424
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,960
I've been spending
more time with Sam.

425
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:07,362
I know
it's been hard on you.

426
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:08,863
I figured if you
had some company--

427
00:18:08,931 --> 00:18:10,365
I don't need your help.

428
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:12,333
Then consider it helping
our neighbor's four-year-old.

429
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:14,636
I gave him a dollar.

430
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:16,171
How much did you
have to pay?

431
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:17,338
Nothing.

432
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:18,873
I just told them
you might be feeling down

433
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:20,175
and it was
in their self-interest

434
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:21,576
to keep you company.

435
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:25,246
100 bucks.

436
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,814
Foreman held out for 200.

437
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:28,550
House,
I'm worried about you.

438
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:30,985
You could have ended up
in jail or worse.

439
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:33,288
Racking you with guilt.

440
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:36,024
So I do something really
stupid and you reward me.

441
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:38,059
Read any parenting manual.

442
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:40,028
That's not helping me.
That's helping you.

443
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:43,464
Fine, I did it for me,
for my relationship,

444
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:45,233
out of pure self-interest.

445
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:48,469
Okay.

446
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:49,837
You'll do it?

447
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:52,040
For you.

448
00:18:52,107 --> 00:18:54,209
Thank you.

449
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:55,643
It's not gonna work, though.

450
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:57,512
Maybe.

451
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,515
But how bad can a night out
at a lesbian bar be?

452
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,527
Hey.
How are you doing?

453
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:15,597
Heart attack at 27.

454
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:20,368
Um, they said
you had a head trauma.

455
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:24,672
I fell off a stepladder
and--and hit my head.

456
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,008
It was a stupid accident.

457
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:29,110
An accident.

458
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:32,947
We need to prep you
for your angio.

459
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:34,983
Valium will help you relax.

We're gonna run a line
through your femoral artery.

461

Ted?
He's having
another heart attack?

462
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:42,257
I don't think so.
His heart rate seems normal.

463
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:47,395
Are you okay?

464
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:50,031
You weren't discussing
wedding plans, were you?

465
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:51,966
[Laughs] No.

466
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,468
I guess I just...

467
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:57,639
Fainted.

00:19:57,706 --> 00:19:59,607
(House)
P.O.T.S.

469
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:02,377
Postural orthostatic
tachycardia syndrome.

470
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:04,078
BP plummets
when he's upright,

471
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:05,680
reverts to normal
when he's lying down.

472
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:06,981
He was lying down

473
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:08,116
both times we took
his blood pressure.

474
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:09,217
Protracted hypotension

475
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:10,518
could have induced
his heart attack.

476
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:11,586
Also explains
the syncope.

477
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:12,620
And his aphasia.

478
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:13,755
He was upright,

479
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:14,722
then you laid him
down on the bed

480
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,957
to test him.

481
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,592
BP reverted to normal.
Voice came back.

482
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,260
Jabbing him with the needle
had nothing to do with it.

483
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:20,528
P.O.T.S. can be brought on

484
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,363
by a viral or bacterial
infection such as mono.

485
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:25,099
So load him up
with fludrocortisone.

486
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:27,735
You didn't read your ceramics
course description, did you?

487
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:29,771
Yeah. You did?

your wife did.

888
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:33,021
I'm not gay, Nicole.

889
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:35,390
I promise you.

890
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:38,927
How can you
promise me that?

891
00:39:38,995 --> 00:39:41,229
Because I believe
that we get

892
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:42,831
to choose
how we live our lives,

893
00:39:42,899 --> 00:39:46,768
and I've made my choice.

894
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:50,205
So now I have
to make mine.

895
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:52,974
Nic.

896
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:55,510
I'm sorry.

897
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:57,279
Nic.

898
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:01,783
No. No.

900
00:40:03,786 --> 00:40:05,587
I'm not saying good-bye.

901
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:07,556
Yeah.

902
00:40:09,425 --> 00:40:11,727
I want to marry you.

903
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:15,831
I have to marry you.

906
00:40:28,044 --> 00:40:30,245
I called it off.

907
00:40:30,313 --> 00:40:31,947
For real this time.

908
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:34,816
Frees you up
for the next one.

909
00:40:34,884 --> 00:40:36,518
One day at a time.

Napkin rings.

911
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,826
My way of saying thanks.

912
00:40:44,894 --> 00:40:46,862
For trying to wreck
your marriage?

913
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:48,830
For trying to save it.

914
00:40:48,898 --> 00:40:51,166
And I get napkin rings?

915
00:40:51,234 --> 00:40:54,102
Expensive ones.

917
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:10,652
I hired a replacement.

918
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,188
For my P.A.

919
00:41:13,256 --> 00:41:14,389

Good work.

Your patient's
going home tomorrow.

922
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,231
He doesn't have a home.

923
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,569
You want to grab
a bite to eat?

924
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:31,439
So Wilson
got to you too?

925
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:35,710
No. This is just me.

I'm not that hungry.

929
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:48,990
Okay.

930
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,367
I just want us
to be friends.

That's the last thing
I want us to be.
