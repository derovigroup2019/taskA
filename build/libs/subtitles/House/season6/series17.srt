1
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:27,819
My lords, and ladies.

2
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:31,603
Today your queen
will choose her champion.

3
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:35,743
Here, he will battle
for not only her honor,

4
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:38,455
but for a title of his own.

5
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,791
But only if he can defeat

6
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:44,868
the captain of my guard,

7
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,896
sir Horace the black!

8
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,224
Sir William...

9
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:00,948
Wouldst thou fight for my honor?

10
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:03,215
To the death, your majesty.

11
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,745
Let's hope it does not come to that.

12
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:11,772
I choose sir William as my champion.

13
00:01:17,632 --> 00:01:19,585
Attack from his left side.

14
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,331
I saw his squire
bandaging that shoulder this morning.

15
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:28,841
I wish thee luck and strength.

16
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:31,293
I fear I shall need all I can get.

17
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,556
The captain of my guard,

18
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:41,825
sir Horace the black!

19
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:03,814
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to reconsider your choice, my queen?

20
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:07,628
I believe I chose rightly, my king.

21
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,344
Brave knights,

22
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,556
in the honored tradition of our lands,
have at ye!

23
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,536
I fear you chose
most poorly, my love.

24
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,241
What is it?

25
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,290
Your eyes.

26
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:37,444
We need an ambulance
at the Camden fairgrounds.

27
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,359
.:: La Fabrique ::.

28
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:42,979
R[H]?sus AB+ Team

29
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:37,536
You're new.

30
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:39,496
You're naked.

31
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:40,922
And, for the record,

32
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:42,779
a little bit cold.

33
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:44,999
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that anyone was home.

34
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:48,180
James had an early call,
and I was just leaving.

35
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:51,281
- Without breakfast?
- I'm fine, thanks.

36
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:53,059
I'm Sam, by the way.

37
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,229
Nice to meet you.

38
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,648
It'd be nicer if you'd put this on.

39
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:00,030
So you and Wilson...

40
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:02,934
Thought you were staying
in New York last night.

41
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:04,813
Sorry, must have missed the...

42
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:07,824
"if this trailer be a-rockin'"
sign out front.

43
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,411
I'm really late, so...

44
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:15,664
if there's any chance that we can
pretend this never happened,

45
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:18,836
I'd be completely fine with that.

46
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:30,538
An eight-year-old
with bleeding ears.

47
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:33,892
I'll see that and raise you
a total muscular degeneration.

48
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,052
What the hell?

49
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:42,486
I had a dream like this once.
It didn't end well.

50
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:45,445
Huzzah, my loyal peasants!

51
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,418
What are you doing?

52
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,033
Filling in for rabbi Shmuhl
at the Goldstein bris.

53
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:53,981
While I'm busy,
you all can check out the knight

54
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:56,957
down in the E.R.,
who, instead of seizing the throne,

55
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,417
just seized.

56
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:02,546
- He works at a renaissance festival?
- Doesn't work there, he lives there

57
00:07:03,045 --> 00:07:05,108
as part of a wonderful
little troupe,

58
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:07,551
who spend their weekends
reenacting a nobler age,

59
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,671
when people crapped in the streets,
and 13 would have been a grandmother.

60
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:13,849
Weeks, not weekends. Says here
he's been camping out for a month.

61
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:19,737
Try doing that with a pen.

62
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:22,548
Why don't you put that down
before you kill one of us?

63
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:26,142
Why don't you give me something
I can use so I won't feel the need to?

64
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:29,341
Seizure right after a fight
obviously suggests concussion.

65
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:32,352
Obviously it isn't, or the E.R.
wouldn't have called House.

66
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:35,072
A full set of armor
would protect against visible trauma,

67
00:07:35,197 --> 00:07:38,675
but not transmitted concussive force.
Could be a subdural hematoma.

68
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:41,588
You're forgetting to demonize.

69
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:44,555
An evil, satanic subdural hematoma.

70
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,319
Two demon eyes.

71
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:49,301
Hemorrhaging in the sclerae.

72
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,003
Could be an allergic reaction
to something from the renaissance fair.

73
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,012
Which is why we need to check out.
Foreman, take Frodo

74
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:57,742
- and break bread with the hobbits.
- A hematoma is more likely.

75
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:00,622
That's why you and Chase
are gonna get an MRI.

76
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,448
- But you just...
- I said Frodo, not Gollum.

77
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:07,485
Is he saying I have short legs
or hairy feet?

78
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:09,613
I don't even know who Frodo is.

79
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:16,052
Who's the chick,
and why are you hiding her?

80
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:18,038
You were home last night?

81
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,513
And this morning.

82
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:22,126
I bumped into your babe, naked.

83
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:25,102
- I told you to stay out of my bathroom.
- I was in the kitchen.

84
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:27,109
- She was naked in the kitchen?
- I was naked.

85
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:29,478
- Why were you naked in the kitchen?
- It's not important.

86
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,353
What is, is why you didn't want me
to meet her in the first place.

87
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:33,728
Is she married?

88
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,067
A patient?

89
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,933
- I don't have time for this.
- She used to be a man.

90
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:40,059
She wants to be a man.

91
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:42,206
It's a man's name,

92
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:43,621
short for...

93
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:49,357
Samantha.

94
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:54,157
The soulless harpy
you were married to before we met.

95
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:57,534
People change, House.

96
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,863
They get older,
ovaries start drying up,

97
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:04,209
and nice guys like you
look attractive again.

98
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,073
I know that,
in your own demented way,

99
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:08,452
you think you're looking out for me.
But I have this.

100
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,216
By this, you mean a sinking feeling
in the pit of the stomach.

101
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:13,343
Fine.

102
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,471
I get it. It's your life.
You go screw it up. I can wait.

103
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,389
For what?

104
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,433
To tell you, "I told you so".

105
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,721
No signs of hematoma.

106
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:30,557
Brain looks completely normal.

107
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:33,894
Normal, except for the fact
that he likes to play dress-up.

108
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:37,219
My uncle used to pretend
he was king Leopold.

109
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,794
<i>I'm not pretending.</i>

110
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:46,331
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

111
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,184
<i>You don't really think
you're a knight, do you?</i>

112
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:51,176
Being a knight isn't a game.

113
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:55,343
<i>It's a lifestyle, we do it every day,
not just when we play dress-up.</i>

114
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:58,495
<i>We live by a code and uphold ideals</i>

115
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,517
<i>like loyalty, courage, humility.</i>

116
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:04,822
And the part where you beat the crap
out of each other in armor?

117
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:06,897
<i>That we do for fun.</i>

118
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:09,544
<i>At least it was up until yesterday.</i>

119
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:12,069
<i>Are we almost done?</i>

120
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:13,905
<i>'Cause I'm feeling...</i>

121
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:17,949
Let's get him out of there
before he aspirates.

122
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:29,113
Anything abnormal on the MRI?

123
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:32,129
God's teeth,

124
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:34,854
what strange manner
of garments be these?

125
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:37,022
We'll be back soon.

126
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,929
He consorts with tiny demons
in his hand.

127
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:41,757
'Tis witchcraft, I say!

128
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:44,698
Do I look like I'm here
to play pretend with you?

129
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:46,573
Relax, it's not personal.

130
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:51,941
Just tell them you're a time traveler
or something.

131
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,027
If we're gonna be here,
we might enjoy it.

132
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:56,654
Our knight just vomited
inside the MRI.

133
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,963
Taub thinks
it might be food poisoning...

134
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,860
Which shouldn't be surprising...

135
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,599
Outdoor latrines,

136
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,959
food prep going on
next to livestock.

137
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:17,534
I hear you wish to speak with me,
concerning sir William.

138
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:19,511
- How faireth he?
- Not well,

139
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,054
or we wouldn't be here.

140
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,770
- A pox indeed is...
- Miles.

141
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,210
We just thought it was a concussion.

142
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:28,710
He's gonna be okay, right?

143
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:31,557
We need to look at the area
he was camping out in.

144
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:34,878
And you might want to invest
into a dental plan for the kingdom.

145
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:39,145
You sure he got sick
from something here?

146
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,720
We're not sure
of anything yet, but...

147
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,954
What do you make of this?

148
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:51,962
Looks like vomit.

149
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,399
Means he was showing symptoms
prior to the fight.

150
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:56,554
True, but I meant this.

151
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:01,841
It's a cow eye.
From the night before the tournament.

152
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:04,180
He makes the knights
eat all kinds of disgusting stuff.

153
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:07,403
- Why?
- He got the idea from <i>Fear Factor</i>.

154
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:09,541
Why didn't he mention it?

155
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,093
I make them all take an oath of secrecy
about the ritual.

156
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:15,400
William tends to take his role
as a knight very seriously.

157
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:19,067
Do you think
that's what caused him to pass out?

158
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,663
That's not exactly sanitary.

159
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,281
Fun stuff never is.

160
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:35,836
Serious bacterial
food poisoning explains seizure

161
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:36,971
and vomiting.

162
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:40,098
- A lumbar puncture could confirm.
- Except it's not food poisoning.

163
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:43,407
If it was, the E.R. would look like
<i>Camelot</i> right now.

164
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:45,725
All it takes is one bad eyeball.

165
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,950
Or testicle,

166
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:49,517
cow brain, or my personal favorite,

167
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,259
pig rectum, with a side order
of sphincter.

168
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:57,230
- They call that breakfast in Australia.
- No one else was sick,

169
00:12:57,355 --> 00:12:59,569
- 'cause they weren't allergic like him.
- To what?

170
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,973
That's what I sent you
to Middle Earth to find out.

171
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,449
Run scratch tests
for the samples you brought back.

172
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,381
That's gonna take time,
he's getting worse.

173
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:09,422
So treat him with epinephrine too.

174
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:19,420
This should prevent
any more symptoms

175
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,899
until we can figure out
what it is you're allergic to.

176
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:25,178
Told you you shouldn't have
eaten all that stuff.

177
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:29,349
You don't have to stay. You and Miles
are crazy busy, with the wedding.

178
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,143
Miles said we could
postpone it until...

179
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:34,562
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
I'll be there.

180
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,816
I hope you have a good photographer,
the red-eye filter isn't gonna work.

181
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:40,735
I need your right arm.

182
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:49,953
That...

183
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:51,163
feels...

184
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:52,753
feels strange.

185
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:56,960
- What is it? What's wrong?
- His heart rate's become irregular.

186
00:13:57,412 --> 00:13:59,546
My chest hurts.
It feels like it's gonna explode.

187
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:02,382
Tachycardia... We need to shock
him back into rhythm.

188
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,296
I need his gown open.

189
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:09,847
What is that stuff?

190
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:12,433
I don't know.

191
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:22,469
It's not an allergy, or the eppy would
have helped him, not made him worse.

192
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:25,655
Unless he's allergic
and allergic to the cure.

193
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:27,491
Sodium bisulfite...

194
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:29,656
The preservative
that keeps eppy peppy...

195
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,097
Can cause tachycardia.

196
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:33,350
So can
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,

197
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:35,623
and it also causes
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

198
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,750
And abnormal electrical
pathways in the heart,

199
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,302
- which could cause seizures.
- But not skin infections.

200
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:43,412
There is an infection that can cause
skin and neurological damage

201
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:45,538
and spreads rapidly
without treatment.

202
00:14:45,663 --> 00:14:48,167
Methicillin resistant
staphylococcus aureus?

203
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:51,848
- Lord have MRSA.
- You weren't wearing gloves

204
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:54,537
when we shocked his heart
back into rhythm.

205
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,647
I'm sure you'll be fine.

206
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,400
You two get a sample
to the lab to confirm,

207
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,194
you get the knight into isolation
and on I.V. antibiotics.

208
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,113
You... Stay away from me.

209
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:16,956
Need to talk.

210
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,750
- About the MRSA? I know, we're...
- MRSA, SHMRSA.

211
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,234
Something important.

212
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:24,324
Something you think is more important
than the potentially lethal bacteria

213
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,646
spreading like wildfire
through my hospital?

214
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:30,951
That narrows it down
to something personal and stupid.

215
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:33,514
Theory confirmed.

216
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,725
He is dating his first wife.
I know.

217
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:37,550
I don't believe it.

218
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,839
That he didn't ask
your permission first?

219
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:42,899
No, that he's actually capable
of keeping a secret from me.

220
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,444
You'd be surprised how many things
Wilson doesn't tell you.

221
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,179
Would I?

222
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:51,867
Like how you slept
with your father's best friend or...

223
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,560
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You need to break them up.

224
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:57,972
- Forget it.
- So you'd rather sit back and watch

225
00:15:58,097 --> 00:16:01,584
while the evil blonde gorges
on Wilson's tender flesh

226
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,559
and then tosses out his bones
like she did the last time?

227
00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:06,547
You remember
what he was like after that?

228
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:09,926
Yes, I do.

229
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:11,727
Then do something.

230
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:15,060
God knows he's not gonna listen to me.
You, on the other hand,

231
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:18,101
have decades of experience
dating and being attracted to losers.

232
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,434
I don't include myself.

233
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,041
You know what happens when you interfere
in people's relationships?

234
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,316
Of course.
I do it all the time.

235
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:31,542
- I see your point.
- That is why I'm staying out of this.

236
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:35,291
You force him to choose,
you might not like the answer.

237
00:16:44,314 --> 00:16:47,130
He doesn't seem to be
in as much pain anymore.

238
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:49,370
Good, but we won't be
out of the woods for sure

239
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:51,534
until the blisters start to recede.

240
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:54,559
I'm really thirsty.
You mind getting me a soda?

241
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,578
Sure, I'll be right back.

242
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:02,437
What's wrong?

243
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,773
The pain in my chest,
it's getting worse.

244
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:07,052
Just now?

245
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,743
I didn't want to worry her.

246
00:17:12,962 --> 00:17:15,144
So how long have you been
in love with her?

247
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,159
No, we're just friends.

248
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:18,587
Seriously.

249
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:25,657
- Since the first time I saw her.
- Why don't you tell her?

250
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,754
- She's engaged to my friend.
- The king?

251
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,549
Haven't seen him visiting
or sitting by your bedside.

252
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,417
He has responsibilities.

253
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,806
I'm guessing the queen does too.

254
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,072
What kind of knight
steals his friend's bride?

255
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:41,642
I hate that I even think about it.

256
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:44,359
You're not a knight.

257
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:45,884
You're just a guy.

258
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:51,091
But I want to be more than that.

259
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,764
- Your chest?
- No, my back.

260
00:17:58,032 --> 00:17:59,494
Feels like there's a knife in it.

261
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:03,333
Is the infection spreading?

262
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:04,694
It's not MRSA.

263
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:08,404
It looks like some sort
of clostridial organism.

264
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:11,114
Question is,
which type of clostridium?

265
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,589
There's hundreds.

266
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,301
C. Perfringens?

267
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:18,680
Wouldn't account for his other symptoms.
C. Tetani, on the other hand...

268
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:21,240
Tetanus, he would have been
inoculated against it.

269
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:23,518
So he cut himself
and didn't get a booster shot.

270
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:26,056
The guy fights people
with swords for fun.

271
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:27,710
No one said he's smart.

272
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:31,567
They don't just fight for fun.
They fight to prove their bravery.

273
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,695
You're buying this honor stuff?

274
00:18:35,806 --> 00:18:38,206
Fighting's not brave.
It just stupid.

275
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,320
You would say that.

276
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,330
- You think I've never been in a fight?
- No, I think you've never won one.

277
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,936
I took on three guys
in college once.

278
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:49,058
Hope they bought you dinner first.

279
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:50,434
It's not MRSA.

280
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,047
- I know, it's poison ivy.
- Poison ivy?

281
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,133
A severe reaction
could cause the blisters

282
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,635
and maybe irritate his eyes enough
to cause the hemorrhaging,

283
00:18:57,938 --> 00:19:00,064
but the chest pain and seizures...

284
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:01,722
They have bonfires every night.

285
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:04,016
The burning leaves
aerosolizes the oil.

286
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:06,001
We've seen what it's done
to the outside.

287
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:08,253
Imagine what it's doing
to his lungs and his sinuses.

288
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:10,692
Maybe it remotely fits,
but I'd rather go

289
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,775
with scientific evidence
than with your gut.

290
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:14,567
How about this?

291
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:17,969
Apparently, it's all over his sword.

292
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:24,829
- It's his heart rate again.
- How fast is it?

293
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,248
- It's slowing, why aren't you...
- It's not MRSA.

294
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:29,042
I'm giving him 12 ccs epinephrine.

295
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,071
He tested positive.
You'll blow his heart out!

296
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:33,527
If it slows any more,
it's gonna stop.

297
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:38,475
I told you.

298
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,393
And I told you.

299
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:53,659
That wasn't caused by poison ivy.

300
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:54,905
Or epinephrine.

301
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,409
The heart problem we ruled out,
we now have to rule back in.

302
00:19:58,534 --> 00:20:01,032
We found clostridium bacteria
in the skin samples.

303
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:03,407
Clostridium's in dirt
and basically harmless.

304
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:06,096
But opportunistic,
if his immune system is depressed.

305
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:09,597
- Leukemia?
- He would have had symptoms way before.

306
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:12,850
Which is true of anything
that would compromise his immune system,

307
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:16,131
which means it has to be
some other environmental toxin.

308
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,585
Yesterday he was a healthy knight,
today he's sleeping beauty.

309
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,884
Nothing else fits.

310
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,111
- Trichinosis from eating infected meat?
- We already ruled out food poisoning.

311
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:27,038
But the butcher shop and the food stands
at the fair were totally clean.

312
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:29,143
Then he ate the poison apple
somewhere else.

313
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:31,437
Or maybe you just missed it.

314
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:34,815
Start treatment for trichinosis
and confirm with a muscle biopsy.

315
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,345
I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

316
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,831
- Sam...
- I told you so.

317
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:54,543
No, she didn't dump me.
She wants to get to know you better.

318
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:55,794
Damn it.

319
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,714
- I shouldn't have let her see me naked.
- It goes against all my instincts,

320
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,341
but I said all right.

321
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:01,753
Why?

322
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:03,922
She thinks I was hiding her
from you.

323
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:06,389
- You were.
- I don't want her to know.

324
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,599
You're asking me
to condone a relationship

325
00:21:09,724 --> 00:21:11,560
based on lies and mistrust.

326
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,608
- When and where?
- Tonight, Venezia, 8:00.

327
00:21:17,364 --> 00:21:20,069
What am I gonna wear?
All my cereal boxes are at the cleaners.

328
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:22,627
House, listen.

329
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:25,782
I know you're worried about me,

330
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,724
and I also know
that that kind of unselfishness

331
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,955
doesn't come naturally to you.

332
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,250
But I don't want your help.
I don't need your help.

333
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,835
Just come to dinner

334
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:40,214
and be your usual selfish self.

335
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,883
How could I say no?

336
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,316
- Miles said he'd stop by later.
- No, tell him not to.

337
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,437
I don't want to be seen like this.

338
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,505
You're sick.
That's nothing to be ashamed of...

339
00:21:58,253 --> 00:22:00,953
- Unless you want me to leave.
- No, don't.

340
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:05,156
I think he's saying
it's different with you, Shannon.

341
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,909
It's a guy thing...
They don't like showing weakness.

342
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,378
Right, William?

343
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,498
Right.

344
00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:14,678
Maybe when I'm feeling
a little better.

345
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:19,866
I'm gonna take a small sample
of your muscle tissue here.

346
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,091
- Do you mind waiting outside for this?
- Don't hurt him.

347
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:24,666
He's safe with me.

348
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:32,887
- I thought you were gonna tell her.
- It's not my call.

349
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:35,687
But if you ask me,
she's waiting for you to.

350
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,270
Knights are supposed to be selfless.

351
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:42,986
Right, they conquered countries
and built castles by being selfless.

352
00:22:43,335 --> 00:22:46,446
Bravery and loyalty are great qualities
for soldiers.

353
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:47,869
If you wanna be king,

354
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:50,537
sometimes you have to be willing
to take what's yours.

355
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:56,679
She's not mine.

356
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,402
She's not his either...

357
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:00,741
Not yet.

358
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:11,434
It's just dinner. Relax.

359
00:23:11,762 --> 00:23:14,272
Trust me, there is no "just"
when House is involved.

360
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:16,132
We're in the middle of a restaurant.

361
00:23:16,257 --> 00:23:18,007
What could he possibly...

362
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:19,398
Do?

363
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,483
That.

364
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:28,322
Sorry we're late.
But you know girls.

365
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,527
Always fiddling with the hair
and the makeup.

366
00:23:30,652 --> 00:23:32,945
James, Sam... This is Sarah.

367
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,748
It's nice to meet you.
Horace has told me all...

368
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,401
House... has told me all about you.

369
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:40,831
It's nice to meet you.

370
00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:47,586
What's the diagnosis?

371
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:50,761
His muscle biopsy is clean.

372
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:52,556
It's not trichinosis.

373
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,909
House was wrong,
this is not environmental.

374
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,765
Or we screwed up and missed something
at the Renaissance fair.

375
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,132
You think we did?

376
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:02,807
No, but I think House
will think we did.

377
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:04,803
What could we have missed?

378
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,278
Fungal infection?

379
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:11,027
There's nothing in his blood work
even remotely suggesting that.

380
00:24:11,152 --> 00:24:12,902
But it fits the symptoms.

381
00:24:13,388 --> 00:24:16,329
You wanna re-test
every sample we took for spores?

382
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:18,524
We'll be here all night.

383
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,958
Have you noticed
how much pain he's been in lately?

384
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:23,195
And that's relevant how?

385
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,879
Extra pain means extra cranky,

386
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,647
it means off his game.

387
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:29,258
He's not gonna accept
this isn't environmental

388
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:31,333
unless we give him no choice.

389
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,178
I can't believe
you're from Bloomington.

390
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:43,053
I know, isn't it amazing?

391
00:24:45,256 --> 00:24:46,306
Delightful.

392
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,694
Ignore him.
He's just upset that we're having fun.

393
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,988
Do you remember that little bakery?

394
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,116
- The one with the amazing cupcakes?
- Gino's.

395
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,035
First stop, every time I go home.

396
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,203
Me too...

397
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,338
- Remember that strip club?
- I used to work at that strip club.

398
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,674
- Where does it hurt, William?
- My legs! Feels like they're on fire!

399
00:25:20,276 --> 00:25:21,276

400
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:25,606
Rhabdomyolysis means
his kidneys are failing.

401
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,316
Also means it's not environmental.
We need to move on.

402
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:34,116
- I recommend a full cancer workup...
- Who checked out the apartment?

403
00:25:35,382 --> 00:25:38,828
- His symptoms fit an environmental...
- The test results don't, we redid...

404
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,289
Search the apartment.

405
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:43,498
- He hasn't been there in three weeks...
- Go! Now!

406
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,423
I liked him better
when he was on Vicodin.

407
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,301
You and thirteen check out his place.
We'll ultrasound the liver.

408
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,304
If it's cancer,
it's as good a place as any to start.

409
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,520
I hear House met Sam.

410
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,129
First time, he was naked.

411
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:15,937
The second time he brought
a transvestite prostitute to dinner.

412
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:18,182
Overall, it could have been worse.

413
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:19,307
Great.

414
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:23,729
That's your reaction?

415
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,677
Nudity, prostitute...

416
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,580
Sorry, preoccupied.

417
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:35,032
House said something to you,
didn't he?

418
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:37,863
He didn't.

419
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:50,933
It is a little crazy, though.
I mean... Isn't it?

420
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,000
Things seem to be going great.
But they did, too, 12 years ago.

421
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,982
The good things are still good.

422
00:26:58,107 --> 00:27:01,495
She's still smart, funny, gets me.
And she's less competitive.

423
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:04,580
Either she's changed, or I've changed.
But, either way...

424
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:08,216
Am I out of my mind?

425
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:13,881
You never know what can happen.

426
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,410
You might as well give it a chance.

427
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,852
You were right.

428
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:28,323
Tumors...

429
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:31,824
Dozens of them.
Inside, and on the surface.

430
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:34,687
Pull in closer.

431
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:42,031
See that?

432
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:44,955
What is that?

433
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,115
I don't know.

434
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,290
But it's definitely not cancer.

435
00:28:05,077 --> 00:28:06,142
Kitchen's clean.

436
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:08,264
Bedroom as well.

437
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:11,314
Most dangerous thing in his cabinet
was dental floss.

438
00:28:12,946 --> 00:28:14,525
It's locked, key wasn't on his ring.

439
00:28:15,672 --> 00:28:19,135
You wanna go back and tell House
we didn't check every square inch?

440
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:21,141
Of course not.

441
00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:38,632
My hero.

442
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:51,776
What the hell is this?

443
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,498
Either a secret entrance to Hogwarts,
or...

444
00:28:58,775 --> 00:28:59,925
Our knight...

445
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,110
is a witch.

446
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,207

447
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:17,503
Our knight is into
some seriously creepy stuff.

448
00:29:17,628 --> 00:29:20,497
He claims it's just sugar water
but we sent the rest for testing.

449
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:22,009
You think he poisoned himself?

450
00:29:22,134 --> 00:29:24,588
We would have picked it up
in his blood work.

451
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:26,607
Not if it collected
slowly in his liver

452
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:29,292
and it all started leaking
into his system at once.

453
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:31,394
These tumors that aren't tumors,

454
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,050
what if they're focal hepatic lesions
filled with blood?

455
00:29:34,175 --> 00:29:37,386
Every time one explodes
it'd be releasing another dose.

456
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:38,511
Of what?

457
00:29:42,295 --> 00:29:43,545
<i>Plumbum nigrum.</i>

458
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,701
- You putting a hex on someone?
- It's Latin, for black lead.

459
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,884
Our knight/warlock

460
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:51,831
apparently also dabbles in alchemy.

461
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:53,979
Lead poisoning.

462
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:56,210
Seizures, paralysis,
weak immune system,

463
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,588
and eventually, coma.

464
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,463
Biopsy the cysts,
and you'll find your lead.

465
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,872
You think we'll make the 7:30?

466
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:12,840
If I don't change, I'm gonna feel like
I'm at work all night.

467
00:30:12,965 --> 00:30:15,115
- I remember.
- Is it a problem?

468
00:30:15,838 --> 00:30:16,888
Not at all.

469
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:18,901
In fact,

470
00:30:19,706 --> 00:30:20,906
if we hurry...

471
00:30:23,424 --> 00:30:25,824
We will definitely
not make the 7:30.

472
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:27,992
There's always the 9:40.

473
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,462
Or not.

474
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:48,971
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

475
00:30:49,774 --> 00:30:51,807
Wouldn't need a team
if I did all the work.

476
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,101
- Plus, I had to make you dinner.
- We have plans.

477
00:30:54,427 --> 00:30:56,927
I bet your plans
don't taste like this.

478
00:30:58,784 --> 00:30:59,784
Don't!

479
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:06,383
- Whatever it is that you're up to...
- I'm trying to be nice.

480
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:13,152
What I did the other night
was juvenile, I'm sorry.

481
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,867
- The souffl? was amazing.
- It's my mom's recipe.

482
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:33,599
Everything else, I got off the web.

483
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:36,695
Here's to the Internet.

484
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,312
Where I found the lamb ragout,

485
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,315
and you two found each other...

486
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Again.

487
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:43,073
It wasn't just the Internet.

488
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:46,041
More like divorce, depression,

489
00:31:46,491 --> 00:31:49,041
therapy, more therapy,
and the Internet.

490
00:31:49,855 --> 00:31:51,057
And here we are.

491
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:52,932
Exactly. And here we are.

492
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:01,961
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- You're old enough, now.

493
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,996
But if you want me to gowith you...

494
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,798
Is it safe to leave the two of you?

495
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:08,714
Come on, James. Enough, already.

496
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,811
I cook in peace.

497
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:14,627
I'll be right back.

498
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,027
You're a cold-hearted bitch,
who ripped his heart out.

499
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:30,447
I watched him struggle for years
to overcome the damage you did.

500
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,315
No way I'm gonna let you

501
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,163
wheel him back in so you can do it
all over again.

502
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:41,140
And all this?

503
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,300
Phase two
of getting to know my enemy.

504
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:47,881
You're wrong about me.

505
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:51,731
But I'm glad now
I don't have to pretend to like you,

506
00:32:51,856 --> 00:32:54,096
except for when James
is standing next to me.

507
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:55,351
Same here.

508
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:58,225
Only difference is,
I'll outlast you.

509
00:33:01,618 --> 00:33:02,618
And scene.

510
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:08,088
Well, it's too late for the movie.

511
00:33:08,516 --> 00:33:10,653
- Wanna see what's on TV?
- Absolutely.

512
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:12,525
Love to.

513
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:22,725
There wasn't any lead in his blood work
or liver biopsy.

514
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,028
And his heart rate and BP
are getting even more erratic.

515
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:28,020
We had to shock it back into rhythm
twice during the night.

516
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,443
There's only one thing left to do.

517
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,884
We're wasting our time.

518
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,274
Actually,
I've already gotten good value.

519
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:50,428
Nothing here could have caused
any of his symptoms.

520
00:33:50,553 --> 00:33:53,911
You couldn't find anything here
that could be causing the symptoms.

521
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:56,521
We're gonna find something new
because we're in costume?

522
00:33:56,646 --> 00:33:59,196
We looked everywhere,
tested everything.

523
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:02,884
Just because Wilson's acting stupid
doesn't mean we are.

524
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:04,958
Do you think he's making a mistake?

525
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:06,633
Of course.

526
00:34:07,024 --> 00:34:08,712
He'll figure it out,
sooner or later.

527
00:34:08,837 --> 00:34:12,247
Hopefully after weeks of great sex.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

528
00:34:12,372 --> 00:34:13,914
Wilson's not like us.

529
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,375
He cares too much about people
and their feelings.

530
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Thanks.

531
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:20,149
The code that our knight
claims to live by,

532
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:22,396
all that crap
about honor and chivalry.

533
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:25,053
Wilson's naturally like that,
which is why he's...

534
00:34:25,178 --> 00:34:26,278
A great guy.

535
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,732
A sucker and a target.

536
00:34:28,857 --> 00:34:30,807
So we gotta look out for him.

537
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:34,273
Do you smell that?

538
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:36,153
It's the apothecary shop.

539
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:38,428
And yes, Foreman and I already...

540
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,961
I cry your pardon, sir.

541
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,757
- You know what this is?
- That's lavender.

542
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,125
Try rose hips.

543
00:34:55,722 --> 00:34:57,472
Both harmless, who cares?

544
00:34:58,028 --> 00:35:00,055
It could be cyanide
as far as he knows.

545
00:35:01,855 --> 00:35:04,935
- How about this?
- It be nothing but St. John's wort.

546
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,312
Wrong again. Black cohash.

547
00:35:08,754 --> 00:35:11,171
My uncle owns the shop,
I just started apprenticing.

548
00:35:11,296 --> 00:35:12,556
What's the big deal?

549
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:18,161
I just organized all that.

550
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,480
- You know what this is?
- A wild carrot?

551
00:35:26,213 --> 00:35:27,363
It's hemlock,

552
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:30,095
you embossed carbuncle.

553
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:35,139
- That's hemlock? You sure?
- Did you sell it to anyone?

554
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:39,071
It's poison, think hard.

555
00:35:40,882 --> 00:35:42,306
It was just one branch.

556
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,082
You sold it to sir William?

557
00:35:46,302 --> 00:35:47,402
To the king.

558
00:35:52,994 --> 00:35:55,740
It's the only part of the environment
you didn't check.

559
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,000
The people living in it.

560
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,865

561
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:06,663
What's going on?
Why can't we see William?

562
00:36:07,414 --> 00:36:09,164
Because you poisoned him.

563
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:11,835
Your royal anus.
With this.

564
00:36:12,346 --> 00:36:14,196
- Wild carrots?
- Hemlock.

565
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:17,334
I need to know how much you used
and how you prepared it.

566
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:19,437
- You did something to William?
- Of course not!

567
00:36:19,562 --> 00:36:22,054
He's still alive.
You want to avoid a murder charge,

568
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,336
start talking fast.

569
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:26,683
The apothecary's willing to testify
that you're the only one he gave it to.

570
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,062
I bought it for the food challenge,
but I didn't know that was hemlock.

571
00:36:30,348 --> 00:36:32,248
If it was for the challenge,

572
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:34,775
then why is Wee Willie
the only knight who's dying?

573
00:36:35,012 --> 00:36:36,021
I don't know!

574
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:38,487
I didn't know!
Why would I want to hurt William?

575
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,864
I can think of at least one reason.

576
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:42,741
Miles, please.

577
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:45,536
Whatever happened,
just tell them the truth.

578
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:46,704
I am!

579
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:49,187
I swear.

580
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,148
We ran a gas chromatography
on his blood.

581
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:57,297
Found trace amounts
of piperidine alkaloids.

582
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,049
Markers of hemlock intoxication.

583
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:02,344
The good news is
we now know what's wrong with you.

584
00:37:02,694 --> 00:37:05,412
The bad news is
that your king's precious ideals

585
00:37:05,537 --> 00:37:07,437
were just pretend after all.

586
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,143
When it comes to guys
who get too close to his queen.

587
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:12,361
It's not true.

588
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:18,068
You've never heard the expression,
"gas chromatography machines don't lie".

589
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,686
Neither does Miles.

590
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,239
He's the best knight
I've ever known.

591
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:24,544
It's why he was chosen king.

592
00:37:24,669 --> 00:37:26,419
Miles is a jealous idiot.

593
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,544
And you're just an idiot.

594
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:30,660
Something's wrong.

595
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:33,994
We performed a gastric lavage
and administered activated charcoal,

596
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,515
but he's getting worse, not better.

597
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,830
It's been in his system two days.
We're lucky he's lasted this long.

598
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:41,466
If it was hemlock, he'd be dead

599
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:42,935
or getting better.

600
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,655
We found it in his blood.

601
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,324
He may have had some,
but it's not what's killing him.

602
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:55,217
Don't do it!

603
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,858
Whatever you're planning,
especially if you're using that.

604
00:37:58,205 --> 00:37:59,205
Geez.

605
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:00,944
It was just sitting in a stone.

606
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,630
Here.

607
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:06,487
It's gonna cost extra, because
of the level of detail you wanted.

608
00:38:06,612 --> 00:38:07,740
Anything good?

609
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:09,986
And by good, I, of course, mean bad.

610
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,397
Typical life.

611
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:14,035
Married young, got divorced.

612
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,543
Married a little less young,
got divorced.

613
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:19,561
She's been pretty successful,
except marriage.

614
00:38:19,686 --> 00:38:22,090
- There's gotta be something I can use.
- Maybe.

615
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:25,218
Didn't read her shrink's notes.
Didn't seem right.

616
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,346
But stealing them did.

617
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,182
I didn't steal them,
I found a way to obtain them.

618
00:38:30,832 --> 00:38:33,232
Excuse me,
I don't mean to interrupt,

619
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:34,989
but you got a minute?

620
00:38:35,469 --> 00:38:36,469
Sure.

621
00:38:38,225 --> 00:38:40,425
Oh, him? Yeah, I was just leaving.

622
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,821
Careful.

623
00:38:45,174 --> 00:38:46,424
I have a sword.

624
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,973
I don't agree with what you said.

625
00:38:51,098 --> 00:38:53,248
But I understand why you said it.

626
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:56,041
We were married young,
we both made mistakes,

627
00:38:56,327 --> 00:38:59,220
and yes, I did make most of them.

628
00:38:59,345 --> 00:39:01,007
But that was almost a decade ago.

629
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,758
I'm sorry, is that the statutory period
for soul sucking?

630
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:08,004
I'm not asking you
to like me, House.

631
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:10,098
To be honest, I think you're an ass.

632
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,780
But we do have one thing in common.

633
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:15,797
We care about James.

634
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:18,397
So prove it. And dump him... again.

635
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,858
You're insufferable all the time,
aren't you?

636
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,676
Sorry, go on. And, yes.

637
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:26,394
We just reconnected, we have no idea

638
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:27,969
where we're headed.

639
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:31,053
But is it really too much to ask

640
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:33,836
that you gave us a chance
to find out?

641
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:43,171
I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.

642
00:40:15,475 --> 00:40:16,475
We did it.

643
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:18,588
Well, I did it.

644
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:20,125
What did we do?

645
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:23,564
You do?

646
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,529
These aren't focal hepatic lesions,
they're peliosis hepitus lesions.

647
00:40:27,654 --> 00:40:29,676
Which in combination
with an erratic heart rate,

648
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,803
- usually indicates...
- Endocarditis.

649
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,322
Infection on his heart valve.

650
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:36,322
Two major symptoms
of anabolic steroid abuse.

651
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:38,935
- No, he wouldn't.
- And the rhabdo makes the third.

652
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,753
Our patient's a juicer.

653
00:40:41,926 --> 00:40:44,941
Ancient poison accelerated the damage
of the modern poison.

654
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:48,195
Start treatment,
let the king out of the tower.

655
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,300
How are you feeling?

656
00:40:57,563 --> 00:40:58,563
Ashamed.

657
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:01,561
You should be.

658
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:04,544
You'll compromise your ideals
to win a fight,

659
00:41:04,935 --> 00:41:07,335
but not to go
for the woman you love.

660
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,352
That was a game.

661
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,960
Not real life.

662
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:14,763
- I didn't...
- Hurt anyone?

663
00:41:15,118 --> 00:41:16,703
Try telling that to Shannon.

664
00:41:16,828 --> 00:41:20,102
Or maybe I missed something
while she was crying by your bed.

665
00:41:20,882 --> 00:41:23,063
You don't need to win
anyone's heart.

666
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,882
You just need to ask for it.

667
00:41:35,545 --> 00:41:37,868
Miles is a great guy.

668
00:41:39,271 --> 00:41:40,919
He's rich, smart, treats her well.

669
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:43,093
She's gonna have
a great life with him.

670
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:45,254
But me?

671
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,352
I'd do everything I could for her,

672
00:41:47,477 --> 00:41:51,363
but even at my best, it wouldn't be much
and she deserves the best.

673
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:57,365
I guess I'd rather she be happy
even if it means I'm not.

674
00:42:01,506 --> 00:42:03,846
I guess House was right about that,
too.

675
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:05,283
What?

676
00:42:05,851 --> 00:42:07,551
You really are an idiot.

677
