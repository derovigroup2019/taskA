00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,617
Are you ever coming to bed?

4
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,888
I still say
I'm a vegetarian.

5
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:52,690
Well, you can say
that you're an astronaut,

6
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:54,191
But that doesn't make it true.

7
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,493
<i>A salmon is not a vegetable,</i>
<i>Frankie.</i>

8
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:58,862
Well, apparently, eight out of
ten commenters agree with you.

9
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,331
<i>Except for the part</i>
<i>where you said,</i>

10
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:02,266
"I believe
what I want to believe."

11
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:04,001
That they found
a little judgmental.

12
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,636
You blogged our argument?

13
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:08,772
I asked you to quit
talking about me.

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,241
I don't want a bunch of people
that I don't know

15
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:13,110
Hearing stuff that's meant
to be between me and you.

16
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:15,312
I write about my life.

17
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,281
And you're a big part
of that.

18
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:19,249
That's great. I want to be
a big part of your life.

19
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:21,051
But I don't want to be
a big part of their lives.

20
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,687
Take it down,
erase it, delete it.

21
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:25,222
Make it go away.

22
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:35,265
Come on, man.
It's 2:00 in the morning.

23
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,800
These walls are made
out of tissue paper.

24
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:38,836
I gotta be up in three hours
to do a wiring job in Edison.

25
00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:40,771
I'm sorry.
We'll try to hold it down.

26
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,773
Sorry.

27
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:46,143
Frankie,
what happened?

28
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:47,611
whoa, whoa.

29
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:49,279
That's not what you think.
Something's wrong.

30
00:01:49,347 --> 00:01:50,447
<i>We need a police car</i>

Whoa, what are you two

33
00:01:54,352 --> 00:01:56,320
Oh, my God.

34
00:01:59,357 --> 00:02:00,591
Are you all right?
<i>I think it's coming</i>

00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:01,625

It's pathetic.

44
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,542
You divide your nights

45
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:53,744
Between porn
and the discovery channel.

46
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:55,279
Right.
Playing <i>dance dance revolution</i>

47
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:56,847
Is a much better choice.

48
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:58,949
Okay, that was a gift
from a patient,

49
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:02,019
And it happens
to be great exercise.

50
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:04,421
I mean,
who rents porn anymore?

51
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:05,823
Can't you get this stuff
on the internet?

52
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,391
You can.

53
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,827
But you can't get disc two
with the director's commentary.

54
00:03:09,894 --> 00:03:11,295
Come out with me tonight.

55
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:13,664
I'm going speed dating.

56
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:14,932
You mean you're dating
on meth?

57
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,200
Count me in.
You need to meet somebody.

58
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:17,768
This way,
you meet 20 somebodies.

59
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:19,369
Over a five-minute discussion
of proust?

60
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:21,371
Speed dating's
a meat market.

61

<i>Yeah, dozens of women</i>
<i>just waiting to be hit on.</i>

62
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:25,409
Your odds of a happy ending
are nearly as good

63
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:27,411
As staying home
and watching porn.

64
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:38,455
You plan on doing
any work today?

65
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:40,057
I thought I might do
a little light doctoring

66
00:03:40,124 --> 00:03:41,425
In the afternoon.

67
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:44,461
28-year-old female
sudden unexplained coagulopathy.

68
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:45,796
Could be
congenital thrombocytopenia.

69
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:47,865
Platelets look normal.

<i>Politics?</i>
<i>Dominatrix? Cooking?</i>

00:03:57,475 --> 00:03:58,775

<i>Towns used to be too small</i>

82

What if it's not the platelets,
but the glue

84

<i>That holds 'em together?</i>
No.

Thrombin and von Willebrand

<i>and knowing too much</i>
<i>about each other</i>

87

Is exactly
why people leave small towns

88
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:18,629
And move to the city.

89
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:19,830
<i>and a lot of people</i>
<i>choose to stay</i>

You get community,
connection.

92
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,102
Big red as for our tunics.

96
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:32,509

she couldn't have been exposed

00:04:32,577 --> 00:04:33,744

101
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:49,393
I'm supposed you took
the pro-community position.

102
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,295

<i>You also like secrets.</i>

<i>You deny it,</i>

105
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:56,867
It sort of proves
my point.

106
00:04:56,935 --> 00:04:58,835
When we're left
to our own devices,

107
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:01,738
We make lousy choices.

108
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:06,109
Ignore it.

109
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:07,878
<i>I can hear you in there.</i>

110
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:10,514
<i>Open the door,</i>
<i>or I'm calling the cops.</i>

111
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:11,848
We're four stories up,
but there's a fire escape

112
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,150
On the other wall.

113
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:14,151
<i>The ledge</i>
<i>might be wide enough.</i>

114
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:19,456
We're doctors.
We aren't stealing anything.

115
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:22,960
We're collecting samples.

116
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:24,528
Who are you?
The neighbor.

117
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:26,096
Did they say that you could
come in here and--

118
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:27,731
Yup. What do you know
about Frankie and Taylor?

119
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,765
Not much.

120
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,267
<i>The guy works a lot.</i>

121
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:31,435
<i>I see Frankie around.</i>

122
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:33,270
We argue
a few times a week,

123
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:34,237
And then we go back
about our business.

124
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:35,472
What do you argue about?

125
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,740
Frankie's got
some strong opinions.

126
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:39,242
<i>Wants to recycle</i>
<i>every molecule of trash.</i>

127
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,645
You take
the anti-recycling position?

128
00:05:41,713 --> 00:05:43,480
Trash piling up
for composting's

129
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:45,482
Attracting every rat
in the neighborhood.

130
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,184
I had
to put down poison.

131
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,852
It's her private drawer.
What are you doing over there?

132
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,987
<i>She said</i>
<i>she doesn't have any secrets.</i>

133
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:52,022
I'm taking her
at her word.

134
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,825
Is there any chance
Frankie touched the rat poison?

135
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,093
Touched it?
She grabbed a chunk of it

136
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,427
Right out of the mouth
of the schnauzer

137
00:05:57,495 --> 00:05:58,862
From down the hall.

138
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,531
Now every time I put the stuff
down, she picks it back up.

139
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:08,171

00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,640

146
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,158
You brought a date?

147
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:30,193
Wilson seemed to think
it was a good idea.

148
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,695
You need to dive back
into the pool.

149
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:33,130
And he has to swim
in ours?

150
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:35,999
You go to a bar,
you bring your ugly friends.

151
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,734
It's not a beauty pageant.

152
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:39,569
Life is a beauty pageant.

153
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:42,606
Little girls who kiss frogs
expect them to turn into you.

154
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:44,808
Oh, come on.
I'm not that good-looking.

155
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:45,776
Yeah, you are.

156
00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:49,613
You kind of are.

157
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:51,615
So you attribute
every relationship

158
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:53,483
I've ever had to the height
of my cheekbones?

159
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:55,218
Not the whole relationship.

160
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:56,186
Just the beginning.
The rest is your hair.

161
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:57,320
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

162
00:06:57,388 --> 00:06:58,522
Women aren't as distracted

163
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,524
By appearances as we are.

164
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:01,525
They look deeper.

165
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:05,629
You wanna bet?

166
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:06,830
<i>You can't tell anyone</i>
<i>you're a doctor.</i>

167
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:08,031
You're unemployed.

168
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,199
You're also a little slow,

169
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:10,767
Misunderstanding
everything they say.

170
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:12,903
And lose the accent.

171
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,505
A hundred bucks says
you still walk out of here

172
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:16,673
With a dozen names.

173
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:20,010
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the fun is about to start.</i>

174
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:22,813
When I strike this gong,
each man should sit at the table

175
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,014
You've been assigned.

176
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:26,616
When I strike it again,
date's over,

177
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:27,651
Move on.

178
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:32,456
I'm an oncologist.

179
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:34,725
Oh, my aunt and my grandma,
they both died

180
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:36,460
<i>From breast cancer.</i>

181
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:38,895
Do--do you wanna
talk about it?

182
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:42,232
I'm a diagnostician.

183
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:46,703
I find out what's wrong
with people, and I fix it.

184
00:07:46,771 --> 00:07:48,939
Don't all doctors do that?

185
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:52,709
Yeah, but they can't dance
like I can.

186
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:57,180
I play video games.

187
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:58,281
Oh.
Professionally?

188
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:02,519
I wish, bro.

189
00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:06,923
After six months of chemo, we
thought he was out of the woods.

190
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:10,761
I don't want kids.
Check.

191
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,896
I'm thinking about going
from a "c" to a "d."

192
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:14,131
Quadruple check.

193
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:16,066
And I'm on fire
for the lord.

194
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:18,668
I'm a chocolatier.

195
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:21,071
I could tell
by your hips.

196
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,942
Yeah, I guess I could afford
to lose a few pounds.

197
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,545
I don't think I know anybody
who died of cancer.

198
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,080
Thank God.

199
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:31,348
For you, I mean.

200
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:32,349
Obviously.

201
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,484
Except my cat.

202
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:36,853
<i>she died a few months ago.</i>

203
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:38,855
I hate these things.

204
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:40,657
What, are you here
at gunpoint?

205
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:41,558
You need me
to call 911?

206
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:43,727
Friend dragged me.

207
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:46,096
<i>She keeps trying</i>
<i>to fix my life.</i>

208
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:47,864
Which, admittedly,
could use it, but...

209
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:50,567
Still annoying.

210
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:52,769
You like puzzles.

211
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:56,139
I hoped my job would let me
play with puzzles all day long,

212
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:57,974
But it didn't work out
that way.

213
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,810
Police detective.

214
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:02,078
Turns out
criminals are idiots.

215
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:03,880
If they're not gonna bother
to challenge you,

216
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:06,283
What's the point?

217
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:10,787
Is there a fire alarm
we could pull?

218
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:11,855
Maybe get out
of here.

219
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:13,356
Hmm.

220
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:15,392
Except...

221
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:19,930
Maybe you're
just too swoft.

222
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:22,065
Beg your pardon.
Swoft.

223
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,000
It's one
of your crossword answers.

224
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,136
I believe it means
lying manipulator

225
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:28,004
Who tells men anything
they want to hear.

226
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:30,340
You brought a prop
as a conversation starter.

227
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:32,142
Folded the paper
to make it look read,

228
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,777
Filled in some answers,
but you couldn't be bothered

229
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:35,879
To work at it, so you just
put in random letters.

230
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:38,782
You have some natural talent
as a liar,

231
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,684
But not enough brains
to see it through.

232
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:42,552
I'm gonna assume
you're not a cop.

233
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,455
Are the five minutes up?

234
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:58,001
These women would welcome
a call from you.

235
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:02,372
And these women would
welcome a call from you.

236
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:06,142
My.

237
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:19,456
It's nice
to have visitors.

238
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:20,724
I'm updating my blog.

239
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,827
And I'm reading it.

240
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:27,230
You realize
you're in the same room?

241
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:29,599
Sorry.

242
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,368
So I've been thinking
about what you said.

243
00:10:31,435 --> 00:10:32,836
And I'm sure
I washed my hands

244
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:34,237
After I threw out
the rat poison.

245
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:35,772
Apparently you did it
multiple times

246
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,773
Over a course of days.

247
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,341
Can't be too certain.

248
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:39,542
<i>you must be Dr. Foreman.</i>

249
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:42,379
Got to get back
to work.

250
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:45,315
Okay.
Take it easy.

251
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:46,449
What?

252
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:47,350
She reads my blog.

253
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:52,822
Personally, I don't think
you're condescending at all.

254
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,424
That's not what I wrote.

255
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:55,825
When you were taking
my history,

256
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:57,627
I told you I went whitewater
rafting six months ago,

257
00:10:57,695 --> 00:10:59,663
And you said,
"it was unlikely to be related."

258
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,364
I was just giving information.

259
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:03,300
Let's face it.
You got a little snarky.

260
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,701
You can't convey a tone
of voice in writing.

261
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:05,702
<i>I just put what you said.</i>

262
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,703
If you don't want people

263
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:07,938
To think you're condescending,

264
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:10,941
Maybe you shouldn't say
condescending things.

265
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:12,309
Can this wait a second?
'cause I have to pee.

266
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,816
You know, I think
people behave badly

267
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:20,951
Because there are no records

268
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:22,519
Of what we say or do.

269
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:24,087
<i>And nobody believes anymore</i>

270
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:25,655
<i>That God's watching.</i>

271
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:26,856
<i>Well, God's not,</i>
<i>but I am.</i>

272
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:27,857
<i>Everything is on the record,</i>

273
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:30,827
<i>Including everything I do.</i>

274
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:32,495
<i>I don't think</i>

275
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:34,331
<i>My pee is supposed</i>
<i>to be mud-colored.</i>

276
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:40,170
We were wrong
about the rat poison.

277
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:47,387
Coagulopathy plus kidney
equals what?

278
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:49,822
<i>hemolytic uremic syndrome.</i>

279
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,992
Normal creatinine levels.
She has
elevated cholesterol.

280
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,527
Hey, Wilson!

281
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:56,162
Can't find my pornos.

282
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,332
Have you tried
offering a reward?

283
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,667
gaucher's disease.

284
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,036
It would affect her ability
to synthesize vitamin k.

285
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:04,337
She's on a semi-vegetarian diet.

286
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:05,738
Means she gets plenty
of vitamin k.

287
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:07,006
Sjogren's is more likely.

288
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:09,542
I assume you moved them
while you were dusting.

289
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,277
I checked the drawers,
windowsill,

290
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:12,545
Dvd player
in your room.

291
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:16,282
The quiet ones
are always deeply repressed.

292
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,284
I returned them to the store.

293
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:19,519
<i>she had a fish dinner</i>
<i>a couple of nights ago.</i>

294
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:21,654
Could be haff disease
causing rhabdo.

295
00:12:21,722 --> 00:12:23,923
What? Why did you
return them to the store?

296
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:25,558
It's no trouble.

297
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,427
I had to stop next-door
for my dry cleaning anyway.

298
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:28,928
sjogren's wouldn't inhibit
the clotting enzymes,

299
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:30,230
Infiltrate the kidneys--
explains everything.

300
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:31,698
So does haff disease.

301
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,399
I'm not thanking you.
I'm asking you why.

302
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:34,701
<i>because if I did happen</i>

303
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:36,736
To bring a woman home
last night,

304
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:39,973
I wanted it to be
a porn-free zone.

305
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:45,745
You do realize things
don't have to be socks

306
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:47,080
To go into a sock drawer.

307
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:48,081
I'm sorry.

308
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:49,782
Horribly, horribly sorry.

309
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,455
I thought you'd...
Watched them all.

310
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:57,690
You completely ruined
my morning.

311
00:12:57,758 --> 00:13:00,326
I had to pull out
your old family photos.

312
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:02,862
Your mom
was pretty hot.

313
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,501
Haff disease
fits the timing best.

314
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:10,069
Start her on saline
and mannitol.

315
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:22,248
You reading
your patient's blog?

316
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:23,416
Nope.

317
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:24,984
You should.

318
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:28,021
Could be some clues.

319
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:30,456
Too many. Be like doing
a whole body scan.

320
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,425
<i>Send us up</i>
<i>eight blind alleys.</i>

321
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,193
That's why Chase
is doing it.

322
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:37,964
She mentions you.

323
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:39,899
She's never met me.

324
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,801
You're an unseen
presence,

325
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:43,603
Like the wizard of oz.

326
00:13:43,671 --> 00:13:44,771
He was a fraud.

327
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:47,140
She couldn't have gone
with keyser soze?

328
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:49,609
<i>Speaking of movies</i>
<i>that don't make any sense,</i>

329
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:52,178
I stopped at the rental store
to get those pornos back.

330
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:54,647
I told the guy at the counter
I was so grateful

331
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:55,982
That you'd returned them,
but I wanted them.

332
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,983
Guess what.

333
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:59,052
You only returned two.

334
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:01,688
You lost the third.

335
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:03,723
It's decent of you
to pay for it,

336
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,625
Not let them put it
on my bill.

337
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:07,260
You know...

338
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:09,996
I can explain
what happened.

339
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:11,064
I'm sure you could.

340
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:12,398
But rather than listen
to your lies,

341
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:14,967
I thought it'd be more fun
to drive allver town

342
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:17,236
And get another copy.

343
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:19,105
You have--
you have it here?

344
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:30,049
* *

345
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:31,317
Oh, God.

346
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:36,055
<i>Oh, God!</i>

347
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,123
<i>Okay, first,</i>

348
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:39,058
That's not me.

349
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:42,195
It's not--
mostly not--

350
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:43,730
<i>I was in college.</i>

351
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:45,865
<i>I don't--</i>
<i>my roommate was minoring</i>

352
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:46,833
<i>In film.</i>

353
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,068
Are you hyperventilating?

354
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:51,437
Remember that covering your
mouth and one nostril can help.

355
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:53,740
He had to get this in
for some grade,

356
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:55,408
<i>And he was desperate.</i>

357
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:56,743
<i>And the only reason I did it</i>

358
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,077
<i>Was because no one</i>
<i>would ever see it.</i>

359
00:14:58,145 --> 00:15:01,047
Who knew he'd become
an actual director?

360
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:02,382
He's not a director.

361
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:04,117
He's an artist.

362
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:09,188
The way he plays with light
and darkness and...Boobs.

363
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:10,423
<i>that's not me.</i>

364
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:11,457
What are you?

365
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:13,359
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

366
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:15,428
Be not afraid.

367
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:17,930
The forest nymphs have taught me
how to please a woman.

368
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,633
That's not me.

369
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:22,034
That's not--
I mean, you can see

370
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:25,004
It's not me.

371
00:15:25,072 --> 00:15:26,739
He added extra scenes

372
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:29,108
<i>So he could release it</i>
<i>as a porno.</i>

373
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:30,977
Be not afraid,
Wilson.

374
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:33,279
You took risks
for your art.

375
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:37,350
oh, boy.

376
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,554
No one--
hey, look at me.

377
00:15:41,622 --> 00:15:44,223
No one can know
about this.

378
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,960
From this moment on,
my lips are sealed.

379
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:56,035
Sorry.
It's okay.

380
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:58,738
Be not afraid.

381
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:04,510
Find anything?

382
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:07,013
Relevant? No.

383
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,115
Interesting. I guess.

384
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:10,783
There's nothing
that she doesn't share.

385
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:12,485
"angry sex
is overrated.

386
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:14,120
"how can he expect me
to be aroused

387
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:15,788
When I'm so pissed
at him?"

388
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:17,523
Revelations like that might
just earn her a new kidney.

389
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:18,724
<i>An hour after she blogged</i>

390
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,059
About her kidney failure,

391
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:22,528
The hospital got a call
from Singapore.

392
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:25,131
<i>One of Frankie's readers asking</i>
<i>how hard it would be to donate.</i>

393
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:31,103
How good-looking am I?

394
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:35,675
I'm not asking
if you're attracted to me.

395
00:16:35,742 --> 00:16:37,109
I'm looking
for an objective answer.

396
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:39,745
Oh, okay, then it's
an appropriate question.

397
00:16:39,813 --> 00:16:42,114
Last night, I acted
like a complete tosser

398
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:43,549
To prove to House
that women don't go out

399
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:44,584
With me for my looks.

400
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:45,985
Cost me a hundred bucks

401
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:47,520
And my definition
of myself.

402
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:49,121
And women.
<i>So date men.</i>

403
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:50,590
They're not shallow
at all.

404
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:52,692
Everything's physical.

405
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:53,726
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>We are physical beings.</i>

406
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:55,495
Some more than others.

407
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:58,197
Please don't define my entire
gender based on one night.

408
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:00,366
No, what if the patient's
problem is a physical reaction,

409
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:02,201
Not an emotional one?

410
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:04,170
What if her lack of arousal

411
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:05,505
Had nothing to do
with their fight?

412
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:07,840
Sjogren's would inhibit
her normal secretions.

413
00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:13,846
<i>sorry for keeping you up.</i>

414
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:15,648
I thought it better
not to wait till morning.

415
00:17:15,716 --> 00:17:17,116
Oh, it's no problem.

416
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:20,353
I'm a night owl.
Thanks.

417
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,190
So you think I might have
this sjogren's

418
00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:26,025
'cause of my lack of discharge?
Yeah.

419
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:28,761
It's lucky
you wrote about that.

420
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:30,096
And a little crazy,
you're thinking,

421
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:31,230
To share that much?

422
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:32,798
Not crazy.

423
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:36,035
Unusual to be so intimate
with people you don't know.

424
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:37,336
But I do know them.

425
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:39,105
They read my blog,
I comment on theirs.

426
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:41,073
Just 'cause you haven't met
someone physically

427
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:42,241
Doesn't mean
you don't know them.

428
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:45,444
What about you?
Are you in a relationship?

429
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:47,280
It recently ended.

430
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:49,081
Oh. I'm sorry.

431
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:51,484
Lie flat on your back
all the way.

432
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,189
But you saw each other
every day, right?

433
00:17:57,257 --> 00:17:58,891
How much did you tell her
about what you were thinking?

434
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,459
Or did you just
end up talking

435
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:01,861
About where you were going
to dinner

436
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:05,231
And who needed
to do the laundry?

437
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:07,099
Is that what your relationship
with Taylor is like?

438
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,100
No.

439
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:11,671
Oh, maybe a little.

440
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:14,340
You know, he's great,
but sometimes it's easier

441
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:18,244
To open up to people
who aren't looking at you.

442
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:20,212
You need to lie flat
for us to get the x-ray.

443
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,315
I'm actually not comfortable
on my back.

444
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:24,216
Can't we do it
this way?

445
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:27,353
Did you strain a muscle?
No.

446
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:28,788
What's wrong?

447
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:37,697
I've booked our patient in
for heart surgery.

448
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:39,432
<i>I was doing a sialogram</i>
<i>on her,</i>

449
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:41,067
And she didn't want
to lie on her back.

450
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:42,735
That's a complaint you hear
from people

451
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:44,904
With heart valve issues.
It fits.

452
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:46,138
<i>Sjogren's damaged her heart,</i>

453
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:47,540
<i>Causing her clotting problems,</i>

454
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:49,075
Causing her kidneys
to fail.

455
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:50,309
<i>you based all that</i>
<i>on the fact</i>

456
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:51,510
That she didn't want
to lie down?

457
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:54,614
Well, that
and the cardiac echo I performed

458
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:55,781
After she didn't want
to lie down.

459
00:18:58,118 --> 00:19:00,386
Her mitral valve
is nearly gone.

460
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:02,421
Which means
she's nearly gone.

461
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:06,292
God, you're pretty.

462
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:10,750
so we can replace
the mitral valve

463
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:13,286
With a pig valve
or with a plastic one.

464
00:19:13,354 --> 00:19:15,355
from an actual pig?

465
00:19:15,423 --> 00:19:16,890
it's the better choice
if you want

466
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,358
To have children someday.

467
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:20,727
A plastic valve requires you
to be on anticoagulants,

468
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:22,295
Which are known to cause
birth defects.

469
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:24,896
On the other hand,

470
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,299
The pig valve wears out quickly,

471
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,567
So you'd need to have
heart surgery again

472
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,002
In ten years.

473
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,371
I know that you're on the fence
about having kids,

474
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:33,972
But Taylor really wants them.

475
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,809
It's in the blog.

476
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,979
<i>I'm afraid you two will need</i>
<i>to agree on that decision</i>

477
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,849
Earlier than planned.

478
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,024
It's your call.

479
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,428
Can you pass me
my laptop?

480
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,897
Seriously?

481
00:19:58,965 --> 00:19:59,998
I want to get
some feedback.

482
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,633
You really think
that asking strangers

483
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,635
For some off-the-top-
of-their-head response

484
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,903
Is gonna be helpful here?

485
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:07,205
A lot of your readers
are into animal rights.

486
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,141
They've got you 2/3 of the way
to vegan.

487
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,143
What are they gonna say
about you buying your life

488
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,511
With the life of a pig?

489
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,212
Whatever they say,
I don't have to do it.

490
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,480
It won't work out
that way.

491
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,581
And we're the ones
that are gonna have

492
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,517
To live with this.

493
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,485
Please, Frankie.

494
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,921
Don't tell them.

495
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:25,657
If I start picking
and choosing,

496
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,694
I'm being dishonest.

497
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,929
I'm sorry.

498
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,112
Thanks.

499
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:02,894
<i>Though I guess</i>
<i>I should thank</i>

500
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,463
Whoever taught you
how to please a woman.

501
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,571
Maybe it was
the forest nymphs.

502
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,614
Get my <i>Vertigo</i> poster back.

503
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,719
Be not afraid.
It's exact change.

504
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,289
Okay.

505
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,394
Hello?

506
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:40,098
I'm looking to get something
on House.

507
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,135
Couldn't you just ask
the love nymphs for the secret?

508
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,804
Don't.
My mission is to find

509
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:49,040
Something that House would not
like to see made public

510
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,408
And make it public.

511
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,745
In.

512
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,746
But you know him better
than anyone.

513
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,114
Why do you need
my help?

514
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,983
House would never leave anything
secret around the condo.

515
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,885
But you've worked
in the same office with him,

516
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,053
On and off,
for years.

517
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,421
Think back.

518
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,056
Were there ever
any odd phone calls

519
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,858
Or visitors
from the past?

520
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,827
He openly brings prostitutes
into the hospital,

521
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:10,962
And he gambles with bookies
'cause he's too lazy

522
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,364
To go to the otb.

523
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,199
And you're asking
for some--

524
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,069
What?
What?

525
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,538
What?

526
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,940
He's reading
<i>the golden bowl.</i>

527
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,408
The gold--
by Henry James?

528
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:24,609
Yeah.

529
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,312
No, no,
he's not really reading it.

530
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,815
Okay.
I don't understand.

531
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,384
That book's
at least 400 pages long.

532
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,785
Whatever he's reading
is only half that thick.

533
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,889
Maybe he's reading a version
with a smaller font.

534
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,891
He's not using
his reading glasses.

535
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,394
That's a good point.

536
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,962
He took the cover
off <i>the golden bowl</i>

537
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,298
And put it onto this other book
so no one would know

538
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,966
What he was reading.

539
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,202
Whatever it is,
he's ashamed of it.

540
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:53,405
Huh.

541
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:00,612
I'm going with plastic.

542
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,248
It just makes
more sense.

543
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,350
I don't want
another operation later.

544
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,052
That's not
why you're doing this.

545
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,323
Look, when you were
first telling me

546
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,291
About why you love
the internet, you said

547
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,260
That no one has
to be alone again.

548
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:18,129
Whoever you are,
whatever you love,

549
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:20,098
You can connect
with someone.

550
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,334
If you want to recreate
the Boston Tea Party

551
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,069
While dressed
as imperial storm troopers,

552
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,304
<i>You can find</i>
<i>the ten other people</i>

553
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:27,973
In the world that have always
wanted to do that.

554
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,207
That hasn't changed.

555
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,276
But you have.

556
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:34,946
<i>This thing that you do, it's</i>
<i>not about connection anymore.</i>

557
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,348
It's about an audience.

558
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,450
It's a performance,
and you've got one eye

559
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,719
On the number of hits.

560
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,189
You've turned our lives
into their entertainment.

561
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,094
You're smart,

562
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,328
<i>You're fun to read,</i>

563
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,931
<i>It's okay.</i>

564
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,234
But don't give them this.

565
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:01,273
Or if you do, don't...

566
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:06,211
Expect me to be here.

567
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,583
Well,
it's a good cover choice.

568
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:12,884
It's not like anyone
would pick it up.

569
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,053
It's Cameron's favorite book.

570
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,821
I don't even know
what it's about.

571
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,190
Don't do that
to yourself.

572
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,493
<i>what the hell?</i>

573
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:30,869
Giving him a computer is like
giving plutonium to Dr. No.

574
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,037
Got it.

575
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:40,211
<i>Step by step:</i>
<i>Sermons for everyday life?</i>

576
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:46,785
These are literal sermons,

577
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:47,953
Written by a minister.

578
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,188
Loving thy neighbor

579
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,223
Even when thy neighbor's stereo
is keeping you up at night.

580
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,591
Why would he read this?

581
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,193
Why would he hide it?

582
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,228
He reads the bible,
he reads the koran,

583
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,065
He says he likes to know
what mistakes people are making.

584
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,033
You think
he's sincere?

585
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,868
You think that he's actually
getting something out of this?

586
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,271
I don't know.

587
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:09,374
What a hypocrite.

588
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:12,277
How can we use this
in a cruel yet funny way?

589
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,745
You know what?

590
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,452
Don't mention this
to anyone.

591
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,120
Well, so what was the point?

592
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,362
Are you gonna be here
when I wake up?

593
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:40,805
I hate that you don't
have a blog.

594
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,708
I hate that I don't know
what you're thinking.

595
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:46,845
Let's not get into it
right now.

596
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:50,515
We need to get you
through surgery.

597
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,883
I don't want
to go in there

598
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,318
Knowing that you'll stick
with me through surgery

599
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,487
'cause that's
what good guys do,

600
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,654
But once I'm better,
you'll be gone.

601
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,957
Let's not get into it now.

602
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,327
It hurts.

603
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,895
<i>Is it her heart?</i>

604
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:04,763
<i>no, it's here.</i>

605
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,532
Here.

606
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:10,635
Get her inside.

607
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:20,509
Your appendix burst.

608
00:26:20,577 --> 00:26:21,578
We had to remove it.

609
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,914
And the biopsy confirms
it was full of abnormal cells

610
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:27,249
Consistent with lymphoma.

611
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:32,788
I have cancer?

612
00:26:32,856 --> 00:26:35,791
We've postponed
putting in the new valve.

613
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:38,861
So I mean, I guess we do, what,
chemo and all that stuff?

614
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:41,597
Yes, but apparently
you've had this for some time.

615
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:44,366
<i>When your appendix burst,</i>
<i>it was like a dam giving way.</i>

616
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:46,735
The cells went streaming
throughout your body.

617
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:49,705
So you're saying you'll treat,
but you don't expect it to work.

618
00:26:49,773 --> 00:26:51,640
<i>That's why no valve.</i>

619
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,175
It's pointless.

620
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:54,410
<i>our dean of medicine</i>

621
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:56,745
Has approved
an experimental treatment.

622
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:59,315
<i>We use your unique</i>
<i>cancer cell signature</i>

623
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:01,550
To create a targeted
lymphoma vaccine.

624
00:27:01,618 --> 00:27:04,920
Okay, so that'll cure me?

625
00:27:04,988 --> 00:27:07,356
Well, we're not actually sure
what it'll do,

626
00:27:07,424 --> 00:27:09,325
<i>But the intention is to train</i>
<i>your immune system</i>

627
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:11,460
<i>To recognize and kill cells</i>

628
00:27:11,528 --> 00:27:12,628
Bearing the same
malignant signature

629
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:14,563
While leaving
healthy cells alone.

630
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:17,299
But, as Dr. Foreman says,

631
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,835
<i>It's experimental.</i>
I see.

632
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:21,904
So without it, what kind
of time are we talking about?

633
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:23,873
An exact prognosis
is impossible.

634
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,241
Well, how about a guess?

635
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:26,942
Something, please.

636
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,580
Based on people
in situations like yours...

637
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:32,781
Maybe a year.

638
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:40,589
Baby, whatever we have to do,
we'll do.

639
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:42,124
<i>I can take care of you.</i>

640
00:27:42,192 --> 00:27:44,293
I can work from home.

641
00:27:47,063 --> 00:27:48,864
Sounds good.

642
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:51,700
Thank you
for letting me know.

643
00:27:51,768 --> 00:27:54,103
We'll start with the treatment
whenever it's ready.

644
00:28:01,211 --> 00:28:03,712
Is she being a good soldier,
or is she in denial?

645
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,315
Denial's not unusual
for a first reaction.

646
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:07,650
Or it could be
a symptom.

647
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:09,818
Some lymphomas
affect cognition.

648
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:11,754
If it is denial,
she needs time to process.

649
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:13,055
If it's a symptom,

650
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:15,024
Hopefully treatment
with the vaccine will help.

651
00:28:19,896 --> 00:28:23,332
Hey, sandy.

652
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,603
Can I borrow your car?

653
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:32,741
She gave me the keys.

654
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:34,610
You're a doctor.
She was doing you a favor.

655
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:36,946
She barely knows me.

656
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:38,280
I've been deluding myself

657
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,549
That I'm actually
connecting with people.

658
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:46,755
The first person
I ever fell in love with

659
00:28:46,823 --> 00:28:49,758
Turned out to be
a total tool.

660
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:52,528
I mean, he came across
all funny and charming

661
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:53,996
And thoughtful,
but it was an act.

662
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:55,497
He saw something he wanted,

663
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:57,199
And he knew he had to behave
a certain way to get it.

664
00:28:57,267 --> 00:29:01,370
In retrospect, the fact
that I was 17 and he was 30

665
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:03,739
<i>Should have been a clue.</i>

666
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,809
Figuring out who people are
takes time.

667
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:09,411
It takes twice as much time if
they're trying to impress you.

668
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:12,314
Now I could take from this that
anyone who loans me their car

669
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:13,983
Has an ulterior motive,

670
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:18,821
Or I can accept that it's just
a nice thing to do

671
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:21,390
And take people
as they come.,

672
00:29:23,893 --> 00:29:27,830
You wanna do
the first injection?

673
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:44,847
Why are you reading a book
by a unitarian minister?

674
00:29:44,914 --> 00:29:46,415
Book club.

675
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:48,717
Oprah was going on and on...
I'm serious.

676
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:50,719
This--this is messed up.

677
00:29:50,787 --> 00:29:52,788
Patient wrote it.

678
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:55,124
No, you've never treated
a patient with this name.

679
00:29:55,191 --> 00:29:56,425
I looked it up.

680
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:00,729
It's an assignment
from my therapist.

681
00:30:00,797 --> 00:30:02,564
No, it wasn't.

682
00:30:02,632 --> 00:30:03,832
No one you respect

683
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,135
Would give you this
and expect it to be helpful.

684
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:07,169
It's a book!

685
00:30:07,237 --> 00:30:08,604
Of sermons.

686
00:30:08,672 --> 00:30:10,472
For anyone else,
spiritually enlightening.

687
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,842
For you, it's practically
a psychotic break.

688
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:23,452
I know that you have trouble
sometimes with the pain

689
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,721
Without the vicodin--
is that it?

690
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:27,923
Are you so out of options,

691
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:30,292
You're looking for answers in
what you consider irrationality?

692
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,561
I'm all right.
Trust me.

693
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:37,900
Are you all right
because you're back on vicodin?

694
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:41,136
I said, "trust me."

695
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:44,373
I know
this means something.

696
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:46,542
Do you mind?

697
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:48,944
I haven't finished it yet.

698
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:04,820
Thanks for the gift.

699
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:06,722
Obviously differs

700
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:07,923
From my own personal beliefs,

701
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,259
But if these stories
have helped you

702
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,260
Through some
spiritual turmoil--

703
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:14,096
Read chapter six,

704
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,565
Entitled "shut the hell up."

705
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:18,700
I appreciated the inscription
about the benefits of prayer

706
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:19,768
<i>Before medical treatments.</i>

707
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,136
<i>And I think it's great</i>

708
00:31:21,204 --> 00:31:23,038
That you have been called
to witness by the lord.

709
00:31:23,106 --> 00:31:28,176
Chapter two,
"bite me."

710
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:30,445
Hi.

711
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,648
<i>Thirteen's giving our patient</i>

712
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:34,049
Her third vaccine injection.

713
00:31:34,117 --> 00:31:35,150
She's responding well
so far.

714
00:31:35,218 --> 00:31:36,218
Where'd you get
all these copies?

715
00:31:36,286 --> 00:31:37,419
It's out of print.

716
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:38,787
<i>I called the author.</i>

717
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,089
He's got cartons of the thing
in his basement.

718
00:31:41,157 --> 00:31:42,858
You called him?
What'd you say?

719
00:31:42,926 --> 00:31:45,327
That I knew some people
who could benefit spiritually

720
00:31:45,395 --> 00:31:46,762
From the book.
Did you mention me?

721
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:48,330
Mm, no.

722
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:54,303
Fever's at 104.

723
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,837
The antibodies tripped
her autoimmune response.

724
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:58,774
The vaccine is killing her.

725
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:05,447
well, clearly it's not working.

726
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:06,949
You have to stop
the vaccine.

727
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:09,518
sure. Give up.
Let her die on schedule.

728
00:32:09,585 --> 00:32:11,987
It's better than speeding up
the schedule.

729
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,755
How quickly did this come on?

730
00:32:13,823 --> 00:32:14,823
She was all right
when I woke her this afternoon

731
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,991
To give her
the second injection.

732
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,125
<i>of the stimulating agent,</i>

733
00:32:17,193 --> 00:32:19,661
Which,
added to the first injection,

734
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,862
<i>Switched her immune reaction</i>
<i>into overdrive.</i>

735
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:24,232
Why was she sleeping?

736
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,268
Who can sleep in a hospital
during the daytime?

737
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:27,469
I'm not surprised.
She's tired.

738
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:28,937
She's always been
a night owl.

739
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:30,439
<i>Just by treating her,</i>

740
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:31,740
<i>We've completely disrupted</i>
<i>her schedule.</i>

741
00:32:31,808 --> 00:32:33,175
Is that what her blog says?

742
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,209
She's a night owl?

743
00:32:34,277 --> 00:32:36,078
No, she told me.

744
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:37,679
<i>in what tense? Is? Was?</i>

745
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,947
Will have been?

746
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:40,949
I'm not sure.

747
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:42,417
What are you onto?

748
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:44,353
Look at the time stamp
on this post.

749
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,221
2:30 a.M.

750
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:47,656
<i>Here's one at 4:00 a.M.</i>

751
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:49,491
Whatever he's onto
doesn't change the fact

752
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,860
That she has lymphoma and we
gave her a dangerous vaccine.

753
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,995
We need to--
<i>six months ago,</i>

754
00:32:53,062 --> 00:32:56,031
She's posting
in the daytime.

755
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,367
Two years ago,
daytime.

756
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,102
That's her natural rhythm.

757
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:01,603
Day-night reversal.

758
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:03,071
Sign of liver disease?

759
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:04,373
<i>which doesn't fit lymphoma.</i>

760
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,507
But we know
she has lymphoma.

761
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:07,376
We know she has
the cell atypia

762
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,178
That indicates lymphoma.

763
00:33:10,246 --> 00:33:12,180
Biopsy her liver.

764
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:21,390
That was pretty cool
what I did, right?

765
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,992
You wanna make out?

766
00:33:28,331 --> 00:33:29,765
You don't have lymphoma.

767
00:33:29,832 --> 00:33:31,566
But you said my appendix
was full of cancer cells.

768
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:32,801
<i>your appendix was full of cells</i>

769
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:35,237
That showed
a lymphocytic atypia.

770
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,406
We now think they were
a granulomatous buildup

771
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,207
From some unknown cause.

772
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,746
So...

773
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,248
I'm not dying?

774
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:52,954
You're actually dying
more quickly than we thought.

775
00:33:53,022 --> 00:33:55,457
<i>unless we figure out</i>

776
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:58,994
What's causing
your liver failure...

777
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:05,534
You have three or four days.

778
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:18,747
What the hell do you mean
I have three or four days?

779
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:21,683
Well, we're past denial.

780
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,232
Maybe we didn't cause
the fever.

781
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,334
We gave her
the vaccine,

782
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:55,102
And her fever spiked.

783
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,937
<i>Seems to me--</i>
yes, but it persisted

784
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:59,173
<i>After we took her</i>
<i>off the vaccine.</i>

785
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,774
What if it's a new symptom?

786
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:03,544
Okay.

787
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:06,780
So we add fever
to cell atypia, coagulopathy,

788
00:35:06,848 --> 00:35:08,048
<i>Kidney, heart, liver...</i>

789
00:35:08,116 --> 00:35:09,883
It has to be an infection.

790
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:10,884
<i>but which one?</i>
<i>No one she knows is sick.</i>

791
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:12,419
She hasn't traveled anywhere.

792
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:13,587
There's nothing in the history
she gave us.

793
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:14,955
<i>Nothing in her blog.</i>

794
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:16,924
There has to be something unique
to this infection.

795
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:17,958
<i>Something</i>
<i>about its transmission</i>

796
00:35:18,026 --> 00:35:19,360
<i>And the way it manifests.</i>

797
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:21,528
There has to be something
she's not telling us.

798
00:35:21,596 --> 00:35:23,163
There isn't.

799
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:28,435
She's told us,
and everyone else, everything.

800
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,376
Start her
on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

801
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:38,479
Since we know everything,

802
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:40,614
We might as well treat
for everything.

803
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:53,293
* *

804
00:35:57,632 --> 00:36:03,237
* all those simple thoughts *

805
00:36:03,304 --> 00:36:08,175
* all those
peaceful dreams *

806
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:11,845
* share the space *

807
00:36:11,913 --> 00:36:15,849
* with a hard-worked,
hard-worked day *

808
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:19,219
* *

809
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:22,856
* glory, glory *

810
00:36:22,924 --> 00:36:28,195
* hallelujah *

811
00:36:28,263 --> 00:36:30,197
* *

812
00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:33,600
* the sun is shining *

813
00:36:33,668 --> 00:36:37,104
* shining down *

814
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,477
I picked up one of the copies
of the book

815
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:46,480
That Chase left
in the lounge.

816
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:48,882
If you're gonna be this way,

817
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,584
I'm not gonna invite you
to my baptism.

818
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:53,587
First time I'd seen
the real dust jacket.

819
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:56,623
The inside back flap, there was
a picture of the author.

820
00:36:56,691 --> 00:37:00,594
<i>Imagine how surprised</i>
<i>I was when I recognized him.</i>

821
00:37:00,662 --> 00:37:03,263
Your biological father
is a minister?

822
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:09,636
Natural selection
is not an infallible force.

823
00:37:09,704 --> 00:37:13,440
I don't get it.

824
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:16,343
I mean, okay,
he was a friend of the family.

825
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:17,744
You'd only known him
when you were a kid.

826
00:37:17,812 --> 00:37:20,314
But if you wanted
to meet him now,

827
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:21,949
Get an idea of what he's like,

828
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:24,118
Why not just go talk
to him?

829
00:37:24,185 --> 00:37:28,188
"hi, it's greg.
You slept with my mother."

830
00:37:28,256 --> 00:37:29,756
You're capable of it.

831
00:37:29,824 --> 00:37:33,193
I was mildly curious.

832
00:37:33,261 --> 00:37:35,629
Enough to read a book,
not enough to make a phone call.

833
00:37:35,697 --> 00:37:37,431
Please.
You didn't read this.

834
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:39,766
You studied it.
Why?

835
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:41,735
All your life,
you've thought

836
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:43,570
This was crap.

837
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:46,240
You can't suddenly turn around

838
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:51,044
And build a whole new worldview
based on crap.

839
00:37:51,112 --> 00:37:53,747
Crap.

840
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:56,750
You better not be faking this

841
00:37:56,818 --> 00:38:00,621
Just to get out
of a tough conversation.

842
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,994
Do you poop?

843
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:09,530
<i>Come on.</i>

844
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:11,198
Everybody poops.

845
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:14,301
I read the book
in medical school.

846
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:16,403
Sinkers or floaters?
This is the wizard.

847
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:18,539
<i>greasy and soft</i>

848
00:38:18,606 --> 00:38:21,642
Or hard and pellet-like?

849
00:38:23,745 --> 00:38:26,947
Um...

850
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:32,052
Floaters and the first one.

851
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:37,124
You just had to be so swoft.

852
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:38,425
You're a hypocrite.

853
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:40,194
No lies, no secrets,

854
00:38:40,261 --> 00:38:41,795
But everything stops
at your colon.

855
00:38:41,863 --> 00:38:44,831
4,000 pages,
not one word about bms.

856
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:46,833
And I bet yours
don't smell at all.

857
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:47,868
Nobody wants to hear
about that stuff.

858
00:38:47,936 --> 00:38:49,102
<i>readers don't.</i>

859
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,103
People who don't really
care about you don't.

860
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:51,438
But doctors might.

861
00:38:51,506 --> 00:38:53,740
The icky stuff changed,
right, a few months ago?

862
00:38:53,808 --> 00:38:55,209
Well, I became
a vegetarian.

863
00:38:55,276 --> 00:38:57,444
A lot of people misunderstand
how a vegetarian diet works.

864
00:38:57,512 --> 00:38:59,546
You take in
less unusable material,

865
00:38:59,614 --> 00:39:01,014
And your waste
gets more efficient.

866
00:39:01,082 --> 00:39:02,082
Harder and rounder.

867
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,618
Just look at the feces
of rabbits.

868
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:05,986
Seriously.
I think I might have some.

869
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,287
<i>malabsorption.</i>

870
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:09,089
Her system's not retaining
the necessary nutrients.

871
00:39:09,157 --> 00:39:11,725
A g.I. Infection
causes malabsorption,

872
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:13,760
Granulomatous buildup
of cells.

873
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:16,230
It's not contagious since no one
around her got sick--

874
00:39:16,297 --> 00:39:18,665
Whipple's disease.
Whipple's disease.

875
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:21,335
Let's split the credit.

876
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:23,637
Start her
on co-trimoxazole.

877
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:25,539
We all need some secrets.

878
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:30,978
As long as they don't kill us,
they keep us safe and warm.

879
00:39:33,948 --> 00:39:36,416
I'm...

880
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:39,453
I'm gonna be okay?

881
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,921
You'll still need
a new heart valve,

882
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:42,089
And you'll be on meds
for a few years,

883
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:43,757
But, basically, yeah.

884
00:39:43,825 --> 00:39:44,858
Your odds are good.

885
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:02,576
Thank God.

886
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:11,685
I think I wanna go
with the pig valve.

887
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,666
I know you'll go crazy
if you don't tell people.

888
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:29,436
Thank God
you're an enabler.

889
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:37,444
Do you think people can actually
know each other better

890
00:40:37,512 --> 00:40:39,146
On the internet
than face-to-face?

891
00:40:39,213 --> 00:40:41,815
Faces can be distracting,

892
00:40:41,883 --> 00:40:43,750
But there's nothing better
than looking into someone's eyes

893
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:46,687
And, well, everything
that goes with that.

894
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:48,255
I don't know.

895
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:51,925
People meet, they like
something superficial,

896
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:53,093
And then they
fill in the blanks

897
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:54,361
With whatever they want
to believe.

898
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,063
Why are you so hung up
on this?

899
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,964
I refuse to believe it's all
because you just noticed

900
00:40:58,032 --> 00:40:59,599
You have a nice face.

901
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,435
You just came
off a relationship.

902
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:04,938
You know things
go deeper than...

903
00:41:06,941 --> 00:41:08,975
Is that what this is about?

904
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:10,777
You and cameron?

905
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:15,349
I was the one
that pursued her.

906
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:17,017
Maybe I was just filling in
the banks.

907
00:41:17,085 --> 00:41:20,287
Maybe...

908
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:21,855
Maybe the first reaction
was right.

909
00:41:21,923 --> 00:41:24,124
We were just two people
who were in proximity

910
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:26,059
And found each other attractive,
and I never should have...

911
00:41:26,127 --> 00:41:27,394
<i>Paranoia.</i>

912
00:41:27,462 --> 00:41:29,563
You felt something real.

913
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,198
So did she.

914
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:33,033
Don't try
to take it back now.

915
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,337
Can I borrow your car?

916
00:41:38,906 --> 00:41:40,273
No.

917
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:42,209
* she's on my mind *

918
00:41:45,012 --> 00:41:48,348
* I swear it's 10,000 degrees
in the shade... *

919
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:49,883
Why would it make
more sense

920
00:41:49,951 --> 00:41:51,318
For you to read
your father's book

921
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:52,452
Than to go
talk with him?

922
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,254
Can you write a book?

923
00:41:54,322 --> 00:41:55,589
So I can stop talking
to you?

924
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:00,127
* 'cause every minute,
every second *

925
00:42:00,194 --> 00:42:03,263
* every hour,
lord, every day... *

926
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:05,899
You weren't looking
for some big catharsis.

927
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:07,401
You didn't want
to hug the guy.

928
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:08,902
You just wanted
to know how his head works.

929
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,670
How he thinks.

930
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:12,873
'cause I'm fascinated
with how ministers think.

931
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,375
Because you're not
ordinary, House.

932
00:42:15,443 --> 00:42:17,411
You're way out there
on the fringe somewhere.

933
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:18,578
I'm your best friend,
and half the time,

934
00:42:18,646 --> 00:42:20,580
I don't understand you.

935
00:42:20,648 --> 00:42:21,748
You're alone.

936
00:42:21,816 --> 00:42:23,750
Been alone
your whole life.

937
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:28,522
When you read that book,
you were hoping that

938
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,857
Somewhere, underneath
all that talk of God,

939
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,726
There would be
a way of thinking,

940
00:42:32,794 --> 00:42:35,262
A mind that you
could recognize.

941
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:36,696
You wanted
what we all want.

942
00:42:36,764 --> 00:42:39,833
The power to transform
into any water-based object?

943
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:41,368
To look across the gulf

944
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:45,172
And know there's
someone else like you.

945
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:50,243
At least tell me this--
did you find something there?

946
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:52,412
Underneath the God stuff...

947
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,348
More God stuff.

948
00:42:55,416 --> 00:43:00,220
* lochloosa,
she's on my mind *

949
