1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,362
Good explosion!
Drive it! Drive it!

2
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:25,739
You watching 77?

3
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:27,655
I'm watching everybody.

4
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,987
You don't need to watch everybody.
You need to watch 77.

5
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:31,952
You his agent?

6
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:34,033
Just an objective mom.

7
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,910
His explosion is impressive.

8
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:37,995
It's not just burst.
He can pull too.

9
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:41,749
He went to a double "a" school,
he was a bit of a late bloomer.

10
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,125
He's a big man now.

11
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,336
You should be his agent.

12
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,671
Nice pancake, 7-7!

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,758
- You're moving up those draft boards!
- Thank you, sir!

14
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,968
- On one, on one. Ready?
- Break!

15
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,682
Blue 90. Hike!

16
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,814
Good job!
Second level, nice!

17
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,565
Get off our quarterback!

18
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:16,534
Play's over! The play is over!

19
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:27,459
Save the aggression
for between the whistles!

20
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,881
All right, back to work!

21
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,217
Daryl.

22
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,473
Daryl, stop!

23
00:01:42,044 --> 00:01:44,664
R[H]?sus AB+ Team

24
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,647
.:: La Fabrique ::.

25
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:39,408
- What are you doing?
- Canoeing.

26
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,577
But I seem to be taking on water.

27
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:45,080
This is not okay.
Use your own bathroom.

28
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,232
No canoe in my bathroom.

29
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:50,544
My leg hurts.
Soaking it makes it feel better.

30
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,963
You were the one
who had to have this condo.

31
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,981
Maybe next time
you should consider amenities,

32
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:59,345
like two full baths, instead of the joy
of outbidding Cuddy.

33
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:02,661
The guy who signs the loan
gets to pick the bedrooms.

34
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:04,136
Stay out of mine.

35
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:08,979
You owe me 35 bucks
for the grab rail I installed.

36
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,697
Hit the kill screen.
Boss is here.

37
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,784
It's not porn.
It's our new patient.

38
00:03:22,397 --> 00:03:23,202
Bummer.

39
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:27,288
22-year-old male...
6'7", 310 pounds.

40
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,833
Clearly has brain involvement.

41
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,585
The guy has no recollection
of this entire incident.

42
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,254
Football player.

43
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:36,465
Those the ones that get hit
in the head a lot, right?

44
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,842
E.R. CT'd him...
No concussion, no stroke,

45
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:40,411
no cortical degeneration.

46
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:43,389
And he had a full psyche evaluation.
He's not crazy.

47
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:46,600
So it's roid rage. I don't think
they grow them that big naturally.

48
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,610
E.R. also tested for steroids.
He's clean.

49
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:51,146
Only proving that our guy
got his hands on the good stuff.

50
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:53,861
The negative test at least means
steroids is less likely.

51
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:56,110
- We should discuss other possibilities.
- Why?

52
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,552
He injects his sore ankles
with lidocaine every game.

53
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:00,364
You think
he's above injecting steroids?

54
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,932
Repeated head trauma
could damage the base of the brain,

55
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:05,827
leading to a pituitary adenoma,
which leaks GNRH.

56
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:08,329
Pituitary damage
wouldn't be visible on a CT scan.

57
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,804
Could cause the excess hormones
that could cause the rage

58
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:12,709
and would elude
the E.R. steroid test.

59
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:14,304
Fine.

60
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:17,119
Bilateral venous sampling
to find the elevated GNRH.

61
00:04:17,244 --> 00:04:19,394
MRI to find the pituitary damage.

62
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,886
Unless, of course,
there is no pituitary damage,

63
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:25,108
in which case, our guy
got his hands on the good stuff.

64
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:32,748
Let the peasants
handle the peasantry.

65
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:36,310
Your brother needs to get picked up
this afternoon...

66
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,360
from prison.

67
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,363
Your older brother,
in case your confusion is...

68
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,436
- How do you know about that?
- He left a message.

69
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:47,494
Said he couldn't get you
on your cell or at home.

70
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:50,122
I get it.
You're busy.

71
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,082
You'll pick him up the next time.

72
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:53,538
Is that all?

73
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,833
You're officially unbusy.

74
00:04:57,562 --> 00:04:58,912
Family is family.

75
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:01,967
Take the rest of the day.
Go see your brother.

76
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:03,778
I have work to do.

77
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:11,437
Do you feel any pain
that's deep and persistent,

78
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,943
not just muscles or joints?

79
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:15,149
Everything hurts all the time.
That's football.

80
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,649
It might not be just football.

81
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:19,462
We're gonna test for damage
to your pituitary.

82
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,279
If there is,
it could create excess hormones,

83
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,260
which could be causing your pain.
It would also explain your rage attack.

84
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:27,826
If my pituitary is damaged,
how long would it take to treat?

85
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,709
I don't want to get ahead of ourselves
and start promising deadlines.

86
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:31,789
Sorry, doctor,

87
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,707
but he's playing
in front of pro scouts,

88
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:37,012
coaches, and GMS this Saturday.

89
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,671
This is the job interview
for the rest of his life.

90
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:42,244
If we do find something wrong,

91
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:45,136
we can go in through the nose
and repair the damage...

92
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,578
Nothing too invasive.

93
00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:48,471
You'll need a couple days
of recovery,

94
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,672
and then we can have you back
by game time.

95
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,152
There's nothing wrong
with your eyes.

96
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:01,578
Then your gizmo's broken.

97
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:05,642
- I'm seeing spots.
- Or you enlisted,

98
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,518
you got the cool haircut
and the awesome pants,

99
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:11,334
then you realized that your plane ticket
to the Middle East was coach,

100
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,204
and you decided to rethink
your promise.

101
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:17,205
I've already been there...

102
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,163
Three deployments.
Now they want me to go again.

103
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:22,172
But my wife's pregnant.

104
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:25,759
So our homeland should be unsafe
because your private was unsafe.

105
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:30,431
My wife and I planned this perfect.

106
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,788
My enlistment was supposed
to be over last week,

107
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:34,954
so we got pregnant six months ago.

108
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,020
Now they tell me
I'm getting stop-lossed...

109
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:40,482
Army speak for they don't care
that I've already finished my contract.

110
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:42,985
I don't care about the fact
that they don't care.

111
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:44,447
Come on.

112
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:47,698
I waited an extra hour
just to make sure I got you.

113
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:48,811
Why?

114
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:51,334
I saw you limping out there.

115
00:06:52,435 --> 00:06:53,495
Vietnam?

116
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:57,291
How old do you think I am?

117
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,960
I don't know, Vietnam age?

118
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:02,165
Back in my day,

119
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:04,628
the real dodgers had the stones
to run up to Canada

120
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:06,175
or shoot themselves in the foot.

121
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,844
They didn't come to free clinics
whining for doctors' notes.

122
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:11,889
Go hug your wife.
Tell her to get a babysitter.

123
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,059
You'll be back in time to video
the kid's first steps.

124
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,379
I don't need to see the scan.

125
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:23,757
I can tell from your puppy-dog eyes
that his pituitary's fine.

126
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,878
Are you gonna say it, or should I?

127
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:29,006
You were right about the steroids.
You're a genius.

128
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:30,503
Next time with feeling.

129
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:33,568
Put the cheater on a somatostatin analog
to clear it out of his system.

130
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:35,494
Send him back to his football game.

131
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:40,821
I've never done steroids.

132
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:43,517
Somehow your GNRH got elevated.

133
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,633
This will help get it back down.

134
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:48,194
- Mom, I swear.
- Who's gonna draft you, Daryl?

135
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:51,512
You're stupid enough to try that stuff,
the week you're getting tested.

136
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:54,886
You guys must've mixed up your labs
or got somebody else's blood,

137
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,413
because I never...

138
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:58,811
What is that?

139
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,854
Tachycardia.
Lay back down.

140
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:06,327
- Why's my heart beating like this?
- It's not steroids.

141
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,404
I need some adenosine!
And get that crash cart over here!

142
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:14,576
House, next time...

143
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:18,247
Marcus.

144
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:19,638
Right.

145
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:21,082
You two know each other.

146
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:24,383
What are you doing here?

147
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,981
Interviewing.

148
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:28,606
Who are we kidding?

149
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,110
Interview's over.
You got the job.

150
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:32,886
What job?

151
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:34,684
My new assistant.

152
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:37,084
Part of his parole...
He needs a job.

153
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:38,559
Just trying to do my part.

154
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:43,187
You were wrong about the steroids.
Patient had a paroxysmal tachycardia.

155
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,336
We cardioverted him
back to sinus rhythm.

156
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,567
We're gonna get an EKG
and a sestamibi scan.

157
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:51,155
Let's talk outside.

158
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:54,998
Family is family.

159
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:59,402
Good to see you too.

160
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:03,251
Did you have a hard stretch?

161
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,460
No, not bad.
I hardly got raped at all.

162
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:07,967
You can't work here.

163
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:11,048
- Your boss says I can.
- I'm not playing.

164
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,392
Lighten up.

165
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:14,305
Man, this could be fun.

166
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:16,166
I get to see your world.

167
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:18,055
You get me access to the pharmacy.

168
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:21,642
I am playing.
Come on, man.

169
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:23,770
You look good.

170
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,907
I'd know that if you came to visit
every once in a while, but I get it.

171
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:28,032
It's cool.

172
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,284
You don't want to see me.
You don't want to pick me up.

173
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,859
It's all justified.

174
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,948
I'll just have to win you back over.

175
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:38,288
Let me explain something.

176
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:40,393
This man who's offering
you the job...

177
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:42,831
- He's not a philanthropist.
- He seems more helpful than you.

178
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:45,061
He doesn't want to help you.

179
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:48,368
He only wants to use you
to screw with me.

180
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:50,888
You know how you can screw with him?

181
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,050
Act like your brother getting a job
doesn't screw with you.

182
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:55,663
Trust me,

183
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:58,875
it'll be better for both of us
if you go back in there and tell him

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,264
you can't take the job.

185
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:04,101
I'm not a person who has the luxury
of turning down jobs.

186
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:05,771
Figure something out...

187
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,717
'cause you cannot work here.

188
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:31,236
We spent all night,
used all the fancy machines.

189
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:33,128
Patient's heart looks fine.

190
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,052
If it was fine, it wouldn't go aflutter
just 'cause you walked into the room.

191
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:39,221
Light whip, two extra shots.

192
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:40,847
Thank you, sir.

193
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,489
Judging by the look on your face,

194
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:46,061
I assume you're upset
that big bro didn't take your advice

195
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,430
and skip town.

196
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:51,316
- You told him about our conversation?
- He bought me breakfast.

197
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:52,853
It was fun.

198
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:55,821
Put lunch in the books,
just you and me.

199
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:58,115
Our patient could have a PFO.

200
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,510
Naturally, you jump right
to a urinary issue.

201
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:03,954
PFO's not urinary.
It's a heart issue.

202
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,246
It is?

203
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,871
Naturally, you think
it's not a urinary issue,

204
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:12,004
'cause you're so embarrassed
about your own past urinary issues,

205
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,714
you don't dare broach the subject.

206
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:16,334
Come on.

207
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:18,760
You spending the night
over at Bobby Samson's.

208
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:26,601
I did not wet the bed.

209
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:29,498
- I spilled a drink.
- We're not buying it, Eric.

210
00:11:29,618 --> 00:11:31,898
- We never bought it.
- Why are you telling him these things?

211
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,317
What's the big deal?
It was 25 years ago.

212
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,038
Oxygenated
and deoxygenated blood mix,

213
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:40,574
the rough flow causes a clot,
explains the heart and head.

214
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,955
Like that power forward
from Loyola Marymount,

215
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,331
when he...

216
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,890
Hank Gathers?
That's not what happened to him.

217
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,587
Let your brother speak.
What happened to Hank Gathers?

218
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:54,692
Conference tournament...
alley-oop dunk, jams it home.

219
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:56,654
Then he runs up the court and splat.

220
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,978
He dropped dead of a heart thing
on the court.

221
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:02,840
I remember that. On autopsy, they found
he had a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

222
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:04,184
Rage and tachycardia

223
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,602
are warning signs.

224
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,025
Seriously?

225
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,273
Because my brother
remembers a basketball game?

226
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,963
I don't care
where an idea comes from,

227
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:14,278
as long as it makes sense
and embarrasses someone.

228
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:20,562
- Are you out of your mind?
- As a former psychiatric patient,

229
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:24,564
- I take offense at that terminology.
- All I did was ban you from my tub.

230
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:26,466
Whatever happened
to proportional response?

231
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:28,669
Whatever happened
to coherent conversation?

232
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:30,655
That... thing...

233
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,739
broke tiles, gashed the walls,
and pooped everywhere.

234
00:12:34,156 --> 00:12:35,988
Expect a bill for repairs...

235
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:37,569
and payback.

236
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:44,933
- What was that?
- I have no idea.

237
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,729
Everybody else thinks hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy makes sense?

238
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:52,311
Good. Stick the patient
on a treadmill.

239
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:54,025
Stress his heart until it stops.

240
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:56,611
You want to induce cardiac arrest?

241
00:12:57,212 --> 00:13:00,043
Only real treatment is for the patient
never to stress his heart again,

242
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:03,160
which means we have to tell him
to retire at the ripe old age of 21.

243
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:06,279
Stopping his heart
speaks louder than words. Go.

244
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:12,430
Maybe it's a good thing.

245
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:14,421
He gave your brother a job,
responsibility.

246
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,488
I'm not arguing
that he shouldn't have a job.

247
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:19,384
I just don't want him
having one here.

248
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,415
I understand that House
did this to annoy you.

249
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:24,301
But why is he succeeding?

250
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,692
You know what my brother did
the last time he got out of prison?

251
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:34,066
He stole money
from my parents to buy drugs.

252
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:39,194
He robbed a liquor store. Then he moved
on to jacking luxury cars...

253
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,321
Last time.

254
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,619
Every time.

255
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,620
I've known my brother
for over 30 years.

256
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:48,158
You haven't even known him a day.

257
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:51,321
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:58,298
The exterminator charged $250
to get the opossum out of there,

259
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:00,217
and the contractor estimates

260
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:02,356
$1,500 to fix the bathroom.

261
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:06,070
And why are you
jerking Foreman around?

262
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:08,684
Because it's fun.

263
00:14:09,577 --> 00:14:11,371
Maybe you should give
those bills to the guy

264
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:13,896
who left his own
bathroom window open.

265
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:16,965
Your motives always run deeper
than simple fun.

266
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:19,579
I want to learn more
about one of my employees

267
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:21,472
so that I can manipulate him

268
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:24,064
and destroy him
if and when I choose.

269
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:26,840
- Information is power.
- Not buying it.

270
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:30,140
Why don't you tell me
my real evil plan?

271
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:33,581
I don't think there is an evil plan.
You regret not having a relationship

272
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,141
with your own family,

273
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:37,829
and you don't want to see
Foreman go down that same path.

274
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:38,954
I think...

275
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,757
You're actually being nice.

276
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:43,206
Shut up.

277
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:47,673
You can't accuse me
of an opossum attack

278
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:49,933
and underhanded kindness
in the same visit.

279
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:51,184
Then I'll come back.

280
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:54,322
Treadmill test was a bust.

281
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,208
The guy's in unbelievable shape.

282
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,521
We couldn't get his heart rate
above 150.

283
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:02,096
Your boss is secretly
a very nice man.

284
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:06,741
I know.

285
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,761
If we can't re-create
the cardiac event,

286
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:13,290
we can't prove
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

287
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,214
Either we find a bigger treadmill...

288
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:20,027
Or...

289
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:28,013
Did I miss the memo
about you being released?

290
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:29,514
I'm feeling fine.

291
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:31,971
I can't keep laying here
missing practices.

292
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:34,269
All excellent points.
Give me your arm.

293
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:35,870
What's in the shot?

294
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:37,230
It's a vasodilator.

295
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,656
Since we can't exercise
your son's heart on the treadmill,

296
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:41,688
I'm gonna have to do it chemically.

297
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:50,076
- What's wrong?
- You're turning white.

298
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:51,847
What does that mean?

299
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:54,080
He doesn't need football
to get a good job anymore.

300
00:15:59,921 --> 00:16:01,225
Raynaud's phenomenon...

301
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,840
Vasospasms cut off the blood supply
to his fingers.

302
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:06,365
Could be early onset
rheumatoid arthritis.

303
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,216
- Rheumatoid factor is negative.
- Arterial plaque throwing clots

304
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:11,593
would explain the fingers,
head, heart.

305
00:16:11,718 --> 00:16:15,506
You really think a guy with stenosis
could've aced that treadmill test?

306
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:19,295
You're kidding me.
You got him a desk?

307
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,019
And a nameplate.

308
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:25,111
Man's got to have a place
he can call his own.

309
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:27,533
What about Takayasu's arteritis?

310
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:30,241
Lymphoma's a better fit.
We should remove his spleen.

311
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:32,286
Bold move to skip
straight to surgery.

312
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:35,350
His big game's coming up.
We don't have time to biopsy,

313
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:37,321
wait for the pathology report,
and resect.

314
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:38,249
Right.

315
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:40,512
We should remove his spleen
without confirmation

316
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:42,447
so he won't miss the big game.

317
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,790
Hang an ethanol drip.

318
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:46,925
That won't treat
for either lymphoma or Takayasu's.

319
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,258
If it's lymphoma,
the ethanol will make him itchy,

320
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,597
and Foreman can remove his spleen.
Or he'll lose his radial pulse,

321
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:55,067
and Chase can start him on steroids.

322
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:14,007
- What are you doing here?
- My new assignment is...

323
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:15,704
to shadow you in enemy territory

324
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,789
and document your every word
to the patient.

325
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:20,832
Just don't say anything stupid.

326
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:23,127
You're not an idiot.

327
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,337
Don't do this.

328
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:25,947
Come on, man.

329
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,300
I'm a new person now...
No more drugs, no more lying.

330
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,845
And if I can't get my own family

331
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:34,556
to give me an opportunity to prove that,
what's the point?

332
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:38,017
Mom and Dad gave you a chance
and a second

333
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,268
and a third.

334
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,145
I'm not about to give you a 54th.

335
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:01,540
Why isn't your minion
fetching your lunch?

336
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:04,669
He's busy spying
on his little brother.

337
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,464
What?

338
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:10,633
That's very demeaning.

339
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:15,245
You obviously have a theory
as to why demeaning is not demeaning.

340
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,684
You're escalating to prove I was wrong
about you being nice,

341
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:21,019
which you would only do
if I was right.

342
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,604
Do you listen to yourself?

343
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,748
23-year-old just came into the E.R.,
asked for you.

344
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,335
What's her cup size?

345
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:30,403
I don't think his cup size
is relevant to his condition.

346
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:32,363
He accidentally shot himself
in the foot.

347
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:40,211
Seriously?

348
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,996
I give you a choice
between moving to Canada

349
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,251
and shooting yourself in the foot,
you chose the bullet?

350
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:49,047
- I didn't want to be a fugitive.
- This is gonna get you discharged?

351
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:52,497
- We'll patch it up and send you back.
- Don't patch it up.

352
00:18:56,811 --> 00:18:59,432
You got screwed over
by your own government, and that sucks.

353
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:02,894
But all you're gonna get out of this
is a five-day vacation and a band-aid.

354
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:06,648
When I signed up, I was just a guy.

355
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:08,872
Now I'm about to be a dad.

356
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,944
I go back over, there's a chance
my kid grows up without a father.

357
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:17,567
You got a girl pregnant.

358
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:20,119
You're still just a guy.

359
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:31,610
How much longer we have to wait?

360
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:34,050
We have to keep going
until you feel something.

361
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,636
Might help if you told me
what I'm supposed to feel.

362
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:38,892
If I do that,
that's all you'll be thinking about.

363
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:42,470
You'll be telling me that's what
you're feeling. Power of suggestion.

364
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:45,186
The other black dude
who was in here, he your brother?

365
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:48,846
- What gave it away?
- The way you looked at him.

366
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:51,442
I have two older brothers,
and we always want to kill each other.

367
00:19:58,871 --> 00:19:59,909
Something wrong?

368
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:01,898
Not really.

369
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:04,117
It just feels itchy.

370
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,768
- Is that what you're waiting for?
- Means lymphoma's most likely,

371
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:10,378
but that's actually good news.

372
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:13,099
- How could that be good news?
- Because it's treatable.

373
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:15,341
We can remove your spleen
tonight laparoscopically.

374
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,176
Will I be able to run by Saturday?

375
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:19,470
We can get to the radiation
in the off-season.

376
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:22,979
Hey, ma.

377
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,710
Wake up, ma.
Wake up.

378
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,396
I'm itchy.
Means I can play.

379
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:32,677
- What are you doing in the dark?
- Lying in wait.

380
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:37,173
Jeez. What happened to your face?

381
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:38,341
Right...

382
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:40,258
Play innocent.

383
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:43,304
You weren't looking for revenge
for the prank I didn't pull.

384
00:21:43,473 --> 00:21:45,598
It's karmic justice,
but I didn't do it.

385
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:48,601
Of course you realize,
this means war.

386
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:58,004
Isolating the gastroepiploic artery.

387
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,927
Nearly there.

388
00:22:04,095 --> 00:22:06,545
Foreman,
come and take a look at this.

389
00:22:09,522 --> 00:22:10,872
Liver's inflamed.

390
00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:15,383
So the itching
wasn't caused by his spleen.

391
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,108
It's not lymphoma.

392
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,133

393
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:23,636
What happened?

394
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,305
Wilson annexed the Sudetenland.

395
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:28,683
No abnormal T cells or B cells.</i>

396
00:22:28,851 --> 00:22:30,017
It's not lymphoma.

397
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:34,127
Liver biopsy only revealed
nonspecific inflammation.

398
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:35,814
Kind of like the time

399
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,458
you took your mom's
birth control pills on a dare

400
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,319
and ended up with swollen nipples.

401
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,283
- That never happened.
- Right.

402
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:45,574
And your nickname all the way up
through high school wasn't Erica.

403
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:46,617
It wasn't.

404
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,371
I made that one up,

405
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,943
with the understanding
he still had a sense of humor

406
00:22:53,068 --> 00:22:54,208
and would play along.

407
00:22:54,377 --> 00:22:58,331
Polymyositis would explain the head,
liver, heart, even the white fingers.

408
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:01,706
It would be accompanied by a decrease
in muscle power.

409
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,882
Chance to redeem yourself.

410
00:23:05,054 --> 00:23:07,094
Does our patient look strong to you?

411
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:10,349
Sorry, Eric.

412
00:23:10,645 --> 00:23:12,761
Big brother disagrees
with your diagnosis.

413
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:14,136
Felty syndrome?

414
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:16,416
The liver was inflamed,
not the spleen.

415
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,983
Can you believe
they let this guy perform surgery?

416
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:21,745
- What?
- Requesting permission to share my idea

417
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,571
without being belittled.

418
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:25,898
Permission denied. Continue.

419
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:29,118
Our patient has cartilage damage
in both ankles.

420
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:31,829
He gets lidocaine shots
before every game to mask the pain.

421
00:23:31,998 --> 00:23:35,833
Team doctor uses the same needle twice
by accident, viral hepatitis.

422
00:23:36,232 --> 00:23:38,307
You think he's an idiot, Marcus?

423
00:23:38,427 --> 00:23:40,212
I don't think he's an idiot.

424
00:23:40,717 --> 00:23:41,797
Go test his blood.

425
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
Come on.

426
00:23:44,353 --> 00:23:46,153
We have a lunch scheduled.

427
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,947
You jerked me around.

428
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:56,262
Your allegiance
lies with your brother.

429
00:23:56,387 --> 00:23:57,887
I get it. Admirable.

430
00:23:58,545 --> 00:24:01,317
Here's the problem.
I hired you to tell me the truth.

431
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:03,527
If you don't,
you no longer have a job.

432
00:24:04,035 --> 00:24:06,357
I don't know what secret
you're looking to uncover,

433
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,132
but my brother is a decent guy.

434
00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:10,159
He was arrested
for grand theft auto.

435
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:12,390
You're gonna be disappointed.

436
00:24:13,296 --> 00:24:14,296
Try me.

437
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:18,166
- He tell you I was with him?
- Was it your idea?

438
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,695
We did everything together,
I don't know whose idea it was.

439
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,338
I was 16, he was only 14.

440
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:24,506
He couldn't even see
over the steering wheel.

441
00:24:25,124 --> 00:24:27,927
He's quicker with a flathead screwdriver
than most people with a key.

442
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:35,259
Sorry to interrupt
my character assassination

443
00:24:35,384 --> 00:24:36,728
with boring medical stuff,

444
00:24:36,853 --> 00:24:39,688
but when we drew the patient's blood,
it clotted in the vacutainer.

445
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,442
So the problem is not in his blood,
it's the blood itself.

446
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,571
He's been working out in the cold,
it's got to be cryoglobulinemia.

447
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:51,558
I usually love breaking bad news,
but in this case...

448
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:53,577
Start him on Warfarin.

449
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:58,065
I'm so sorry about that.
You were saying...

450
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:04,043
We drove for about ten minutes
before we got caught, and that was it.

451
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:06,761
When our mom
came down to the station,

452
00:25:06,886 --> 00:25:08,995
she didn't say a word
the whole ride home.

453
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,616
She came up to the driveway,
turned off the car.

454
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:14,807
We're sitting in silence.

455
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:18,171
Then without turning around,
she said,

456
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:20,367
"I'll pray for you."

457
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:23,559
And she got out of the car.

458
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:28,278
You got off easy.

459
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:32,180
Easy for you, easy for me,
not easy for Eric.

460
00:25:33,472 --> 00:25:36,245
His life mission became
to never disappoint her like that again.

461
00:25:37,178 --> 00:25:39,540
Because he is a good guy.

462
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,711
I thought he would tell that story
at the eulogy.

463
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:46,463
But he didn't give one.

464
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,511
Your mother's dead?

465
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:56,432
If he didn't tell you,
I'm sure he had a reason.

466
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:00,519
Look, you can mock him all you want

467
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:02,088
about peeing in the bed.

468
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,687
Please...

469
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:07,539
Don't bring up our mother.

470
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:14,635
Your blood contains
an abnormally high volume

471
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,618
of proteins called cryoglobulins.

472
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:19,371
They become thick
when it gets cold outside.

473
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:22,791
It's like a car trying to run
after the oil's turned to sludge.

474
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,002
We think
that's been causing your problems.

475
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:28,589
So I just need a quick oil change
and I'm good to go.

476
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,549
This oil change isn't so quick.

477
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,619
We have to put you on blood thinners
and other medications.

478
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:36,346
The process will take
two to three weeks, but after that,

479
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,517
you should be able to play.

480
00:26:38,768 --> 00:26:39,850
It won't matter!

481
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:42,249
Doctor, if Daryl doesn't play
in front of the scouts

482
00:26:42,374 --> 00:26:44,062
on Saturday, he won't get drafted.

483
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:48,413
- Can't you wait until after the game?
- If we wait and let him play,

484
00:26:48,837 --> 00:26:51,525
there's a good chance he dies
right on the field.

485
00:27:05,189 --> 00:27:06,210
I had an epiphany.

486
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:09,796
Usually that precedes you
walking away with purpose, so...

487
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,132
Flathead screwdriver.

488
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:14,468
And then I say...

489
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:16,746
It's not a game.

490
00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:20,015
It's proof that you didn't rig
the grab rail and make me fall.

491
00:27:20,184 --> 00:27:22,809
I already have proof of that.
I didn't do it.

492
00:27:23,436 --> 00:27:24,645
I can't go on that.

493
00:27:24,814 --> 00:27:28,232
But I can go on the fact I had to borrow
a flathead screwdriver from Nora

494
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:30,609
to install the thing.
We only had a Phillips-head.

495
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,691
Then, I returned it late that night

496
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:35,239
in a completely successful effort
to see her braless.

497
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:37,115
Wait a minute...

498
00:27:37,284 --> 00:27:40,728
Which means you didn't have the tool
to sabotage the grab rail.

499
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:43,247
Braless under, like, a sweater
or like a...

500
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,966
Now I also have proof

501
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:47,292
that I'm not responsible
for the opossum,

502
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:50,170
because I'm absolving you
instead of escalating,

503
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:51,862
which is not my nature.

504
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:56,385
So someone is breaking
into our place just to screw with us?

505
00:27:56,554 --> 00:27:57,754
The opossum...

506
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:00,076
was meant for me.

507
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,960
I'm so tired.

508
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,916
It was exciting till about 2:00 a.m.

509
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,622
Now it's just torture.

510
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,970
Did you even go to college?

511
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:17,515
This is the escalation, isn't it?

512
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:20,080
Keeping me up all night,
nothing happens,

513
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:22,195
then you keep me up all night
again tomorrow.

514
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,920
- This is your retaliation.
- You see, that's just illogical,

515
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:27,946
Cause I'm staying up too.

516
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:29,821
Maybe you napped all day.

517
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,695
I gave you empirical proof
that I did not prank you.

518
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,014
No, you did not.

519
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:37,653
You created empirical proof
that I didn't prank you,

520
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:40,823
selling me on the notion
that you didn't prank me.

521
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,690
Maybe you self-pranked.

522
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:47,334
- I don't master-prank.
- Is that cut on your cheek even real?

523
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:50,459
See, this is exactly
what our nemesis wants.

524
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:53,668
Divide and conquer.
Can't you see that?

525
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:57,009
I'm going to bed.

526
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:58,883
I'm telling you, if you sleep now,

527
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,533
you're gonna wake up
next to severed horse heads.

528
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:02,951
Or worse, the rest of it.

529
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:15,936
The flat screen!

530
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:33,024
You would never sacrifice
the flat screen.

531
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,051
This guy is good.

532
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,239

533
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:44,263
Is there a reason for this?

534
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,247
There is a reason

535
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:52,222
for everything, <i>mes amis.</i>

536
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:56,296
I am troubled to report that we have

537
00:29:56,465 --> 00:29:58,165
a criminal in our midst.

538
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:00,664
Guilty of what exactly?

539
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,054
Last night, the fire sprinklers
flooded our apartment.

540
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,889
And before that,

541
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:08,517
I found an opossum in my bathtub.

542
00:30:08,686 --> 00:30:11,694
You each had motive,
you each had <i>opportunit?</i>.

543
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:14,523
This is the emergency
you paged me about?

544
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:18,109
Not so fast,

545
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,569
<i>mademoiselle</i> Cuddy.

546
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:22,864
No one leaves until they can account
for their whereabouts

547
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:24,157
the evening last.

548
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,862
No one who is employed by me

549
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:32,582
leaves until they account
for their whereabouts.

550
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:36,419
- What about you, professor Chase?
- Why would I?

551
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:40,215
Because you hold me responsible
for breaking up your marriage.

552
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,134
I was with Thirteen, monitoring
our patient's IV blood thinners.

553
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:48,920
- Can either of you prove that?
- The patient's alive and improving.

554
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,470
- Is that proof enough?
- For now.

555
00:30:52,228 --> 00:30:54,112
What about you, colonel Taub?

556
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:57,257
- I was out to dinner with my wife.
- Really?

557
00:30:57,642 --> 00:30:58,900
Your wife?

558
00:30:59,071 --> 00:31:00,171
Yes, really.

559
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:03,102
Good enough.

560
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:05,323
Cause I had you pegged all along.

561
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:08,862
You had all the motive in the world.

562
00:31:08,987 --> 00:31:11,006
First of all, I'm not interested.

563
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:13,581
Second,
I don't even know where you guys live.

564
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,459
Yesterday
I confirmed that you are a liar.

565
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:18,588
What are you talking about?

566
00:31:18,874 --> 00:31:21,006
At least a liar by omission.

567
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:27,762
- Don't.
- Get this, class.

568
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,840
Foreman's mom died.

569
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:34,681
He ever tell any of you?

570
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:38,189
You're getting off topic here.

571
00:31:38,587 --> 00:31:41,037
Is he serious?
Did your mom pass away?

572
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,249
About three months ago.

573
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:47,198
- I'm so sorry.
- Why didn't you tell anybody?

574
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:48,958
And to top it off,

575
00:31:49,244 --> 00:31:51,536
you refused to say anything nice
at the funeral.

576
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:53,955
I didn't talk
because it isn't anyone's business.

577
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,206
Stop.

578
00:31:56,502 --> 00:31:58,585
You don't have to explain yourself
to this guy.

579
00:31:58,754 --> 00:32:00,180
You wanna hit me, don't you?

580
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:01,463
Don't.

581
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:07,309
I quit.

582
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:14,184
You should stop him.
He needs this job.

583
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:17,524
Our patient needs a fresh IV.

584
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:29,304
I don't need two or three weeks.

585
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,448
See?

586
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,118
Got my color back.

587
00:32:32,663 --> 00:32:34,559
You're getting better.
But it doesn't...

588
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:35,784
I am better.

589
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:39,042
My coach had the team doctor come by.
He cleared me to play.

590
00:32:39,211 --> 00:32:41,791
Did your team doctor
realize you're on blood thinners?

591
00:32:45,469 --> 00:32:47,550
- I'm off them now.
- You're still sick.

592
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:51,471
- You're not ready to go off your meds.
- Daryl, it is not worth the risk.

593
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,058
I'll come back on Sunday, Mom.
You can give me the meds I need then.

594
00:32:55,227 --> 00:32:57,527
The treatment doesn't work that way.

595
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:05,019
Please go with him.

596
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:16,856
Antibiotics aren't working.

597
00:33:17,356 --> 00:33:19,457
We're gonna switch you
to different ones.

598
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:21,676
But you're gonna lose your toe.

599
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:29,351
Outstanding, soldier.

600
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,927
As a general rule,

601
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:33,555
before you celebrate,
do a little research.

602
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,230
The army's medical evaluation board

603
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:39,345
is perfectly fine
with nine-toed infantrymen,

604
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:41,479
As long as they can walk and run.

605
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,137
- So I lost a toe for nothing?
- Afraid so.

606
00:33:45,438 --> 00:33:47,652
Unless you want me to keep you
on the old antibiotics,

607
00:33:47,821 --> 00:33:49,571
let the infection spread,

608
00:33:49,886 --> 00:33:52,031
and we could amputate
more than just a toe.

609
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,541
Why are you risking your life
for this?

610
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,616
Your mom doesn't want you to.

611
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:05,703
My mom sacrificed everything for me.

612
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,257
Her telling me not to come here
is just another example of that.

613
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:11,272
I do good out there,

614
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:14,126
I could take care of her
for the rest of her life.

615
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:19,268
Who am I
if I don't sacrifice for her?

616
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,090
That's family.

617
00:34:43,496 --> 00:34:44,496
You okay?

618
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,817
Everything's blurry.

619
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,310
I can't see.

620
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:01,536
Take me back to the hospital.

621
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:07,323

622
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:09,819
The blindness means
we were wrong about his...

623
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:12,456
<i>I'm responsible for that.</i>

624
00:35:12,876 --> 00:35:14,490
<i>Spiked his water with nitrates,</i>

625
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,327
dropped his BP, robbed oxygen-rich
blood from his brain, making him blind.

626
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:21,746
Figured a temporarily blind patient
is better than a permanently dead one.

627
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:24,834
Vision was coming back
when I dropped him off at the hospital.

628
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:27,753
Well played.

629
00:35:27,954 --> 00:35:30,440
If only we could combine
your medical chicanery

630
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:34,009
with your brother's ability
to fetch me mochas, you'd be perfect.

631
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,084
- Where are you?
- I'm busy.

632
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:40,681
Great. We don't have a new symptom.

633
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:42,968
We should stick him back
on his blood thinners,

634
00:35:43,136 --> 00:35:44,750
and he can leave in a couple weeks.

635
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,837
Actually, we do have a new symptom.

636
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:49,962
Any of you take a look
at his readmittance chart?

637
00:35:51,142 --> 00:35:53,720
Between the time he checked in
and the time he rechecked in,

638
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:55,945
our patient lost a single pound.

639
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,417
Patient like that
would usually shed over ten pounds.

640
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:02,230
The obvious answer
would be steroids,

641
00:36:02,355 --> 00:36:04,599
but since we've already
ruled them out...

642
00:36:04,724 --> 00:36:06,277
So he's not injecting.

643
00:36:06,402 --> 00:36:08,399
But he could be getting them
naturally.

644
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:10,162
Paraneoplastic syndrome.

645
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:13,179
The body produces antibodies,
which battle cancer,

646
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,042
which could act like growth hormone.

647
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,740
We've eliminated lymphoma.

648
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:19,168
What other cancers
mimic growth hormone?

649
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:21,256
Lung, pancreatic, renal, breast...

650
00:36:21,424 --> 00:36:23,814
It was a rhetorical question.
I don't really care.

651
00:36:23,939 --> 00:36:25,302
Test him for all of them.

652
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,766
- What are you doing here?
- You need a job.

653
00:36:43,249 --> 00:36:45,489
Maybe I can talk to House,

654
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,533
see if I can get your job back.

655
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,901
Soon as he knows
you're okay with me being there,

656
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,122
he won't want me back.

657
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,487
Maybe I can help you
figure out something else.

658
00:36:58,457 --> 00:36:59,557
I promise...

659
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:04,397
- I won't let you down.
- Don't do that.

660
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:08,156
Let's just...

661
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,434
see how it goes.

662
00:37:14,444 --> 00:37:16,728
Do they mandate you
to stay here at the halfway house?

663
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:22,835
Or can you stay with family?

664
00:37:36,436 --> 00:37:37,586
It's Foreman.

665
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:39,800
It should stop now that Marcus left.

666
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,575
That's the whole point.

667
00:37:45,936 --> 00:37:47,850
I'm sorry, was my leg sticking out?

668
00:37:48,815 --> 00:37:50,394
I'm so distracted trying to think

669
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:52,396
of something funnier
than fire sprinklers

670
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:54,319
going off
in the middle of the night.

671
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:55,858
Any ideas?

672
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:01,071
Easy, I know where you live.

673
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:04,069
You know how I know?
Cause my girlfriend and I...

674
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:06,594
we tried to buy
that very same condo.

675
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,037
Leave me out of this.
Wilson bought the place.

676
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:10,905
And you're living there.

677
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:12,541
You...

678
00:38:13,118 --> 00:38:14,668
deserve to suffer equally.

679
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:17,640
Actually, I suffered more
now that you just tripped me.

680
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:21,800
His suffering will equal out,
'cause he actually feels remorse.

681
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:23,695
Why would you out yourself?

682
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,804
You can't even imagine
the retribution.

683
00:38:26,384 --> 00:38:27,834
There won't be any.

684
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,601
I am ceasing
all offensive operations.

685
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,854
I have both made my point
and established my superiority.

686
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:37,274
And if you even get
to the planning stages of retaliation,

687
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:39,985
I will tell Cuddy
she lost her dream place to you two.

688
00:38:40,576 --> 00:38:44,197
See, she's under this odd impression
that you are her friends.

689
00:39:02,511 --> 00:39:03,911
There's no cancer.

690
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:07,220
We scanned him head to toe,
we checked blood smears for leukemia.

691
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,514
We even ultrasounded his chest
for breast cancer.

692
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:11,497
Maybe I was wrong
about the weight loss.

693
00:39:11,622 --> 00:39:13,936
You weren't,
we found blood in his catheter bag.

694
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,688
- His kidneys are failing.
- So it has to be cancer.

695
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:20,150
Paraneoplastic syndrome
is the only thing that can link kidney,

696
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:21,809
heart, and liver, even the rage.

697
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:23,320
Why can't we find it?

698
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,197
We've looked everywhere.

699
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:29,088
What if it's not inside?

700
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:45,884
You know why you're black?

701
00:39:46,526 --> 00:39:48,428
Cause god loves me
more than he loves you?

702
00:39:49,563 --> 00:39:51,263
I was going for melanin.

703
00:39:51,697 --> 00:39:53,055
You got lots of it.

704
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,851
It makes your skin dark,

705
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:57,432
protects you
from the sun's harmful UV rays.

706
00:39:57,557 --> 00:39:58,635
What you doing?

707
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,987
Unfortunately, it also prevents
even those with advanced medical degrees

708
00:40:02,112 --> 00:40:04,712
from considering melanoma
as a diagnosis.

709
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:05,996
Other hand.

710
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,075
On the rare occasion that black people
do get skin cancer,

711
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:12,202
they usually get it
on the white parts.

712
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:14,406
Palms and soles of the feet.

713
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,861
But your hands and feet

714
00:40:16,986 --> 00:40:19,086
are so smashed up from football,

715
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:22,025
my team are likely
to have written off

716
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,047
any skin blemish as a bruise.

717
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,159
But now that I know that melanoma
is the only thing that fits...

718
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:32,805
Come take a look at this, Mom.

719
00:40:36,538 --> 00:40:39,038
There's the thorn
in the panther's paw.

720
00:40:39,564 --> 00:40:41,264
Paraneoplastic syndrome.

721
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,410
Your body forms antibodies
to fight the tumor.

722
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:46,099
Those tiny little proteins

723
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:48,151
travel through your blood
and wreak havoc.

724
00:40:48,276 --> 00:40:51,626
We remove the cancerous mole,
everything should be fine.

725
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:54,637
I'll tell Dr. Chase
to schedule the surgery.

726
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:57,781
Why bother? I missed my shot.

727
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,751
What life am I gonna lead now?

728
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:03,299
Did you study really, really hard?

729
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:07,349
Then the same crappy life

730
00:41:07,474 --> 00:41:10,415
that the guys you'll be graduating with
are gonna lead.

731
00:41:10,822 --> 00:41:12,522
Minus the student loans.

732
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:20,896
- You ready?
- Almost.

733
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:25,542
Done.

734
00:41:26,988 --> 00:41:29,219
I heard House and Wilson
are getting pranked.

735
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,198
You wouldn't know anything
about that?

736
00:41:32,817 --> 00:41:35,952
- Why should I believe you?
- You said I had a trusting face.

737
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:40,082
I still don't understand
why you wouldn't let me retaliate.

738
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:42,086
They stole your dream.

739
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,461
That's overstating it.
It's just a condo.

740
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:48,144
It's not because you feel guilty
about hurting House

741
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:50,507
or guilty for being with me?

742
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:53,845
We'll buy another one. I just don't see
the need to make a war out of it.

743
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:55,650
I think you're rationalizing,

744
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,891
which a less confident man
might take as a sign

745
00:41:58,059 --> 00:41:59,709
you're second-guessing.

746
00:42:00,756 --> 00:42:03,230
Okay, you know what?
Forget that last part.

747
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:09,426
I heard Foreman and his brother
are trying to work things out.

748
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:12,963
- That's nice for them.
- It's nice of you.

749
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,494
You didn't provoke Marcus to quit
so the pranks would stop.

750
00:42:17,837 --> 00:42:20,247
You were becoming the common enemy
they could bond over.

751
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:22,397
You are the diabolical,

752
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,292
yet benevolent puppet master.

753
00:42:24,855 --> 00:42:26,445
I provoked Marcus to quit

754
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,863
because he was no longer
useful to me.

755
00:42:28,983 --> 00:42:31,758
I hired him to get information,
I got information.

756
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:34,553
And how are we gonna get back
at Lucas?

757
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:35,721
We're not.

758
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:39,048
I win.

759
