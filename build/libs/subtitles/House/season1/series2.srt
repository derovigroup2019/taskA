00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,972
[Man]
On your right.
On your right. On your right.

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,132
Back, back, back, back, back.
Come on, buddy.

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,077
Yeah, Dan! Yeah!

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,876
Yea.!
[Woman]
Yea.!

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,282
[Man]
Back, back, back, back, back.
Watch the winger.!

00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,156
[Chattering]

8
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,425
Yeah.!

9
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,847
You okay?

10
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,984
Dan? Dan, talk to me.

11
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,757
Dan. Dan.

12
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,663
Get a doctor!

13
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,537
- Hey.
- Close the door.

14
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,168
Close the door.

15
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:57,007
Is Cuddy down the hall
counting to 50?

16
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,916
She knows I'm in here,
in the clinic, as she commanded.

17
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:03,217
- She just doesn't know I'm alone.
- Well, you've got a full waiting room.

18
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,019
- How long do you think you can ignore them?
- I'm off at 4:00.

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,024
You're doing this
to avoid five minutes of work?

20
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,724
If I go out there, I get assigned
a kid with a runny nose.

21
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,030
That's 30 seconds looking at the nose,
25 minutes talking to a worried mom...

22
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,900
who won't leave until she's sure
it's not meningitis or a tumor.

23
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,338
Yes. Concerned parents
can be so annoying.

24
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:25,036
Just tell Cuddy you've got an urgent
case. You had to leave early.
That would be lying.

25
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:30,014
And that would be wrong. But luckily
the definition of"urgent" is fungible.

26
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,711
Not the definition
of"case" though.

27
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,886
You have no cases?

28
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,017
You have no cases?

29
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,825
You've got handpicked
doctors-specialists-

30
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,799
working for you,
and they're sitting on their hands?

31
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:51,701
- Cameron's answering my mail.
- Oh, time well spent, I'm sure.

32
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,762
Foreman and Chase?

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,831
Research?

34
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,878
[Typing]

35
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,245
Nine letters.
Iodine deficiency in children.

36
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,479
Cretinism.

37
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,764
So, 4:03 p.m.,
Dr. House checks out.

38
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,766
Please write that down.

39
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,029
Dr. House.
Sorry. Done for the day.

40
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,004
Plenty of docs here
to take care of you.
But we had an appointment.

41
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,406
Nice try, but this is
a walk-in clinic, which means
there are no appointments.

42
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,706
You walk in, sign the chart,
and a doctor will see you.

43
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,271
Just not me.
Your letter says that we'd see you.

44
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,717
Not a big letter writer.
Here.

45
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,780
When did my signature get so girlie?

46
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,053
- I can explain.
- See that "G"?

47
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,561
See how it makes a big loop on top?

48
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,997
Doesn't even look like my handwriting.
Think I have something?

49
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,468
What's the differential diagnosis
for writing G's like
a junior high school girl?

50
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:01,268
It's impossible to get to you
through normal channels.
They have called, e-mailed.

51
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,243
Perseverance does not equal worthiness.
Next time you want to get my attention,
wear something fun.

52
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,279
Low-rider jeans are hot.

53
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:12,410
Sixteen-year-old male. Sudden onset
of double vision and night terrors,
with no apparent cause.

54
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,953
The kid's been to
two neurologists, and he-
Night terrors?

55
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,819
- As in big scary monsters?
- Yes.

56
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,152
- Where are you going?
- To see the family.

57
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,291
- You're going to examine a patient?
- Nine times out of 10,
there's no reason to talk to a patient.

58
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:32,202
But night terrors in a 16-year-old
is a very good reason
to talk to this family.

59
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,206
Good work.

60
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,110
Margins are fine.

61
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,112
No lesions.

62
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,646
Color is good.

63
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,050
How long have you been
having night terrors?
Three weeks.

64
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,318
He's afraid to go to bed.
He's exhausted,
can barely function.

65
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,885
- What does that tell you?
- Nothing. It's just fun
watching him blink.

66
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,455
Name as many animals as you can
that begin with the letter "B." Go.

67
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:11,302
- Baby elephant?
- Baby elephant is actually
a good answer.

68
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,902
- "B" is a bear of a letter.
- What does that tell you?

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,007
Proves two things:
No neurological damage, and your son
is never gonna be chief fry cook.

70
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,815
In teens, there are two
likely causes of night terrors.

71
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,585
- Posttraumatic stress. Any recent
shoot-outs at your high school?
- No.

72
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,886
- Then, Dave-
- Dan.

73
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,020
If there's no trauma,
the other cause is... sexual abuse.

74
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,169
So who's molesting you?
Teacher?

75
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,228
Extra-friendly neighbor?
I'd ask if either of you
were involved, but you'd deny it.

76
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,035
We would never hurt Dan.

77
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,508
I say it here,
it comes out there.

78
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,068
This lack of response
is consistent with abuse.

79
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,944
There's no one, okay?
L- I swear.

80
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,110
There was trauma.
I got hit in the head
during a lacrosse game.

81
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,321
Did you know
that he got hit in the head?

82
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,918
- They didn't mention it. No.
- Yeah. Why bother?

83
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,356
No, no. We took him
to the E.R. After the game.

84
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,958
He was scanned. They tested him.
They said he was fine.

85
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,970
No concussion.
It's gotta be something else.

86
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,530
You hound me for my opinion,
and then you question my diagnosis.

87
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:19,009
Cool. E.R. Obviously screwed up.
Kid's got a concussion.

88
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,206
I had double vision before I was hit.
Well, that changes everything.

89
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,079
You need glasses.
That's why you had double vision,

90
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:29,850
which is why you got hit,
which is why you have a concussion,
which is why you have night terrors.

91
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,948
You need to see an ophthalmologist,
which I am not.

92
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:38,395
You enjoyed that. I brought a reasonable
case to your attention, and you shoved it
in my face just to humiliate me.

93
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,331
You're an only child, aren't you?
Why would you say that?

94
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,130
Because everything is about you.

95
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,570
This may seem incredibly controversial,
but I think sexual abuse is bad.

96
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,633
I just wanted to make sure
he wasn't being diddled
by Daddy- or Mommy.

97
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,736
Anything else is just a bonus.

98
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,990
I'm not an only child.
Interesting.

99
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,324
What?
Don't move.

100
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,033
- Did I bore you in there?
- What? Uh, no. Not- Not really.

101
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,467
Are you tired?

102
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,596
- Sometimes.
- He never sleeps.
Of course he's tired.

103
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,140
- Right now. At this moment.
Are you tired?
- No. No.

104
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,438
That twitch in your leg.
Did you feel that?

105
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,042
- Didn't hurt.
- His leg twitched.
I don't see what-

106
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,880
It's called a myoclonic jerk.
It's very common
when you're falling asleep.

107
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:37,321
Respiration rate falls, and the brain
sometimes interprets this as the body dying,
so it sends a pulse to wake it up.

108
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,585
- So?
- So, he's not asleep.

109
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,389
He's awake.

110
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,453
Admit him.

111
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,868
[House]
I recognize that loopy "G. '"

112
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,928
So, what does thejerk tell us?

113
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,303
Nothing good.
The brain's losing control of the body.

114
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:59,140
Can't order the eyes to focus,
regulate sleep patterns
or control muscles.

115
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,237
A movement disorder
or a degenerative brain disease.

116
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,841
Either way, this kid's gonna be
picking up his diploma
in diapers and a wheelchair.

117
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,885
Maybe not that bad.
Could be an infection.

118
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,978
You wish.
No fever, no white count.

119
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:14,493
Anyone think this differential diagnosis
might be compromised because
we don't have an accurate family history?

120
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,825
- I took an accurate family history.
- You didn't even take an accurate family.

121
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,994
- His father's not his father.
- Why would you say that?

122
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,127
Thirty percent of all dads
don't realize they're raising
someone else's kid.

123
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,331
False paternity's more like 10%.
That's what our moms
would like us to believe.

124
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,897
Who cares?
If he got it from his parents,
they'd both be dead.

125
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,843
- Can we get on with
the differential diagnosis?
- Fifty bucks says I'm right.

126
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,472
- I'll take your money.
- Hit a nerve?

127
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,006
- Don't worry. I'm sure the guy who
tucked you in was your daddy.
- Make it a hundred.

128
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,885
What about leukoencephalopathy
in a 16-year-old?

129
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,253
It doesn't necessarily
have to be that bad.

130
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,350
If we exclude the night terrors,
it could be something systemic.

131
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,952
- His liver, kidneys.
Something outside the brain.
- Yes.

132
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,761
- Feel free to exclude any symptom
if it makes your job easier.
- Night terrors were anecdotal.

133
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:59,567
- He could've had a bad dream.
- No. Parents said he was conscious during
and didn't remember anything afterwards.

134
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,573
- That's a night terror.
- Parents said?

135
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,734
[House]
That's a good point.

136
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,074
Before we condemn this kid,
maybe we should entertain
Dr. Chase's skepticism.

137
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:12,209
I want a detailed polysomnograph.
If he's having night terrors,
I want to see them.

138
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,797
[Breathing Erratically]

139
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,935
I usually don't move
during night terrors.

140
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,943
I'm not restraining you for them.

What are you doing?

144
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,457
- Fixing it.
- Can I talk to my parents?

145
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,592
Oh, they know all about this.

146
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,193
I'd really like to see them.

147
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,114
Please. I'd really like them here.

148
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,875
This is gonna hurt, Dan.

149
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,944
Oh. Oh, God.

00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,297
That's a night terror.

153
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:56,615
[Foreman]
We did a C. T., M.R.I., C.B.C.,
CHEM-7 and chest X-ray.

154
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,749
All the tests came back normal.
There's nothing to explain his symptoms.

155
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,659
Okay, but let's pretend
there's something and go from there.
Who sees something on this M.R.I.?

156
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,629
No lesions in the white matter.
No structural abnormalities.

157
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,669
No space-occupying tumors.

158
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:15,673
He's 16, so he should have
an absolutely pristine brain.
The smallest thing is abnormal.

159
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,342
Meningeal enhancement.

160
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,972
- My bet is viral meningitis.
- Excellent.

161
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,982
Do you see what he did there?

162
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,816
Took a small clue that
there's a neurological problem
and wasn't afraid to run with it.

163
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,355
There's no evidence
of meningitis on that M.R.I.

164
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,323
No, there's not.
He's completely wrong.

165
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,416
Then what clue
are you talking about?

166
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:39,294
He knew that I saw something
on the M.R.I., so he figured there must be
something there and took a guess.

167
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,857
- Clever, but also pathetic.
- So what did you find?

168
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,927
Take a close look at the corpus callosum.

169
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:52,010
- Looks okay.
- Are we all looking at the same thing?

170
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,546
Two hundred million
interhemispheric nerve fibers.

171
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,673
The George Washington Bridge
between the left and right side
of the brain.

172
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,046
It's subtle.

173
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,455
There's some bowing. There.

174
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,516
An upward arch.
Are you guessing?

175
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,494
Yes.

176
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,329
- Too bad. You're right.
- He probably just moved.

177
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,994
Nobody stays perfectly still
for the entire M.R.I.

178
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:22,564
Yeah. Probably got restless
and shifted one hemisphere of his brain
to a more comfortable position.

179
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,906
Something is pushing on it.
If there was bowing,
could be a tumor.

180
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:29,436
Do you see a tumor
on this M.R.I.?
No, but I don't see any bowing either.

181
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,042
There's no tumor.
Just a blockage causing pressure
causing symptoms.

182
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,555
Today, night terrors.
Tomorrow, he's bleeding
out of his eyes.

183
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:41,389
Get him a radionucleotide cisternogram.
I guarantee you'll see a blockage.

184
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,287
[Dan Whimpering]

185
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,290
Okay.

186
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,867
Easy.

187
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,203
Okay. Squeeze my hand.

188
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,105
All right. Squeeze hard.

189
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,615
[Dan Whimpering]

190
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,617
[Father]
All right.

191
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,090
Now I'm injecting a material
that's tagged with a radioisotope.

192
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,996
It's gonna enter your spine
and travel up to your brain.

193
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,967
It'll make you able to
think deep thoughts,

194
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,970
run a hundred miles an hour.

195
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,503
Easy.

196
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,414
Their eyes aren't the same color,
but that fleck in the eyes-

197
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,517
That's maybe a one-in-10 chance
if they're not related?

198
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,994
No. House isn't gonna pay you
based on that.

199
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,931
[Chuckles]
Any excuse we can give the folks
to justify a D.N.A. Test?

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,130
We could tell them he's got Huntington's-
whole family should be tested
or they'll all die.

201
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,435
[Chuckles]

202
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,609
Hey.

203
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,545
There's a lot of blockage.
I've scheduled him for surgery.

204
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:12,448
We're gonna put a shunt
into one of the ventricles
to give the cerebrospinal fluid an out.

205
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,146
No more pressure,
everything goes back to normal.

206
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,156
He's lucky to have you
as his doctors.

207
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,792
[Woman Chuckles]

208
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,858
No formula. Just Mommy's
healthy, natural breast milk.

209
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,630
Yummy.

210
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,798
Her whole face just got
swollen like this overnight.

211
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,104
Mm-hmm.

212
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,442
No fever.

213
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,345
Glands normal.
Missing her vaccination dates.

214
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,077
- We're not vaccinating.

Gribbet!

217
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,018
Think they don't work?

218
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,391
I think some multinational
pharmaceutical company
wants me to think they work-

219
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,693
pad their bottom line.
Mm-hmm.

220
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,063

- Sure.

[Baby Giggles]

00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,074
Yeah. All-natural,
no dyes is a good business.

00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,270
All-natural children's toys.

225
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,836
Toy companies- they don't
arbitrarily mark up their frogs.

226
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,941
They don't lie about how much
they spend on research
and development.

227
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:24,615
The worst that a toy company
could be accused of is making
a really boring frog.

- Gribbet, gribbet, gribbet.

You know another
really good business?

230
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,726
Teeny, tiny baby coffins.

231
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,297
You can get 'em
in frog green,

232
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,802
fire-engine red- really.

233
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:43,103
The antibodies in yummy Mummy
only protect the kid for six months,

234
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,769
which is why these companies
think they can gouge you.

235
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,575
They think that you'll spend
whatever they ask
to keep your kid alive.

236
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,673
Want to change things?
Prove 'em wrong.

237
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,346
Few hundred parents like you decide
they'd rather let their kid die
than cough up 40 bucks for a vaccination,

238
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,913

242

A cold.

243
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,129
[Cameron]
There's a problem.

244
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,333
Complications in surgery?
Surgery went fine.
He's in recovery.

245
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,740
But we took a vial
of C.S.F. And tested it.
Really?

246
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,780
Turns out the bowing
wasn't the cause of his problems.
It was a symptom.

247
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,940
Oligoclonal bands
and increased intrathecal IgG.

248
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:28,180
Which means multiple sclerosis.
And the reason it takes
three of you to tell me this?

249
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,983
Because we're having a disagreement
about whether or not it is M.S.

250
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,617
No lesions on the M.R.I.
It's early. He's had the disease
for maybe two weeks.

251
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:38,424
- McDonald criteria requires six months
to make a definitive diagnosis.
- Who cares about MacPhearson?

252
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,431
- I hear he tortured kittens.
- McDonald.

253
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,990
Oh, McDonald.
Wonderful doctor, loved kittens.

254
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,036
The V.E.P. Indicates slowing of the brain.

255
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,072
[Cameron]
Without the lesions,
we can't be sure.

256
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,573
Well, if it is, it's gone from
zero to 60 in three weeks,

257
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,609
which would indicate
rapidly progressive M.S.

258
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,010
Not the fun M.S.
With the balloons and the bike rides
for cripples in wheelchairs.

259
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,208
- We should wait until-
- Start treating him now,

260
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:02,549
maybe he can walk
for another couple of years,
maybe live for another five.

261
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,146
Break it to the family.
I'm going home.

262
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:09,285
[Chase] It'll take months
for a definitive diagnosis.
What'll happen to me?

263
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,227
M.S. Is an incredibly variable disease.

264
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,699
If it is M.S., and we're not
a hundred percent sure.

265
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,237
What do you think is gonna happen?

266
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,872
There are some medications
to manage the symptoms,

267
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:28,071
but as the disease progresses,
the problems will become more severe.

268
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,479
Bowel and bladder dysfunction,

269
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,143
loss of cognitive function, pain-

270
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,709
So it's gonna hurt?

271
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,356
The brain's like a big jumble of wires.

272
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,985
M.S. Strips them of the insulation,
and the nerves die.

273
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,689
Brain interprets it as pain.

274
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,028
But by starting treatment,
we're gonna prevent that
for as long as possible.

275
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,968
We're looking into
a couple of specialists,

276
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,563
and until we get you squared away,
you'll stay here, okay?

277
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,751
Security checked the videotapes
from all perimeter cameras.

278
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,060
He's still gotta be in the hospital.
Where's Chase?

279
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,692
Main floor.
Okay. You take the cafeteria
and administration.

280
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,362

and work my way back to you.

Dr. House.

00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,543
Dan's missing.
Yeah. I got that part from the message.

292
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,845
You said I was needed immediately.
He shouldn't move
after a lumbar puncture.

293
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,614
I agree. He's gonna have
a very nasty headache.

294
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,815
That would also be my opinion
if consulted tomorrow morning.

295
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,053
We wanted to keep you informed.
He heard some pretty heavy news.

296
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,591
This is not a toddler wandering
around a department store.

297
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,862
He's 16. You'll find him.

298

I'm going home.

299
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,906
So when you say,
"Call me if you need anything,"
you mean don't call?

300
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,203
No, I mean call me
if I could do something.

301
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:14,405
I'm bad at search parties,
and I'm bad at sitting around
looking nervous, doing nothing.

302
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,504
What about his parents?
Should we call them?

303
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,982
Why? Do you think
they're hiding him?

304
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,019
Make sure someone
checks the roof.

305
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:25,887
Some of the orderlies
keep the door propped open
so they can grab a smoke.

306
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,292
[Chase]
Dan. You okay?

307
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,766
There are experimental treatments.
Ongoing research.

308
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,239
Who knows what they'll discover
in a year or two.

309
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,276
This is where I dropped the ball.

310
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,868

on the roof of the hospital.

00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,268
I assume you found the kid.

319
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,940
He almost walked off
the roof.
Suicidal?

320
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,883
No, he thought he was on his
lacrosse field. Look, I was gonna
run home, shower, change-

Yeah.

00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,549
How'd you talk him down?
Actually, Chase tackled him.

323
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,559
How come you didn't do it?

324
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,061
Right. Well, I am black,
but he was closer.

325
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,563
[Elevator Bell Dings]

326
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,623
Come on.
You can ride up with me.

327
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,863
[Sighs]

328
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:26,038
Anybody tell the family that
their boy almost stepped off a roof?
They must be thrilled.

329
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,306
They're not suing,
but I think only because
Chase asked-

330
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,905
Why does everybody
always think I'm being sarcastic?

331
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,177
This is great news.
He doesn't have M.S.

332
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,948
Parents should be thrilled.
The mom anyway. Of course,
the dad probably doesn't know-

333
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:41,322
- Why doesn't he have M.S.?
- He was on the roof, thinking
he was on a lacrosse field.

334
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:45,261
- Conscious, and therefore not
a night terror. You want some of this?
- Yeah, sure.

335
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,423
He was in an acute
confusional state,

336
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,297
which doesn't fit with
a demyelinating disease like M.S.

337
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,428
Oligoclonal bands-
Were real.

338
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:56,031
They just mean something
other than M.S.
So, what are they telling us?

339
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,099
That the immune system
is working?
Right.

340
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,303
He has an infection in his brain.

341
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,370
What about sex?

342
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,678
Well, it might get complicated.
I mean, we work together.

343
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,811
- I'm older, certainly, but maybe you like that.
- I meant maybe he has neurosyphilis.

344
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,653
- Huh. Nice cover.
- Sorry. R.P.R. Was negative.

345
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,182
[House] We don't need
a definitive test to confirm.
Sure. Didn't need one to confirm M.S.

346
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:20,755
Okay. Let's wait for you to
run titers on 1,400 viruses while
this kid's brain turns to mush.

347
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,427
So the fact that
he doesn't have M.S.,
it's- it's really not good news after all.

348
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,630
Well, it is if it's neurosyphilis.

349
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,765
The likelihood of a false negative
on an R.P.R. Test: 30%.

350
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:33,333
Likelihood of a 16-year-old having sex:
Roughly 120%.

351
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,846
I'll start him on I.V. Penicillin.
We're not gonna wait for that.

352
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,441
The most effective way
to deliver the drug is
right into his brain via the spine.

353
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,452
We can't.
In a cramped space like the brain,

354
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,286
increased intracranial pressure
from a high-volume drug like penicillin
could herniate his brain stem.

355
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,383
It'd kill him.
No neurologist in his right mind
would recommend that.

Show of hands.
Who thinks I'm not
in my right mind?

357
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:55,231
And who thinks I forget this
fairly basic neurological fact?

358
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,530
Who thinks there's a third option?

359
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,540
- Very good. What's the third choice?
- No idea. You just asked
if I thought there was one.

360
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,439
The patient has a shunt in his brain.
There'll be no increased pressure.

361
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,040
We can put as much penicillin
into his body as we want.

362
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,053
Excellent. Inject him through
a lumbar puncture.

363
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,085
One of us is gonna do this to you
twice a day for the next two weeks.

[Inhales, Exhales Deeply]

365
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,660
- I'm ready. Go.
- He could get syphilis...

366
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,326
even if he's not sexually active?

367
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,804
Well, it's- it's unusual,
but it's possible.

368
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,798
Okay. Relax.

369
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,752
It's infected,
with a really big hole,

370
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,191
like you stuck a nail in it
to relieve the pressure.

371
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,253
I wouldn't do that.
Although the wound
is irregular.

372
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,596
It's not cylindrical.
It's shaped like a triangle.
So, not a nail.

373
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,726
- Steak knife?
- Wife's nail file.

374
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,294
Nail file.

375
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,431
Yeah. Pain will make you
do stupid things.

376
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,535
- Something to take the edge off?
- Yeah.

in Princeton?

379
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,319
No.
Here on work?

- No. Why are you-
- Does your penis hurt?

No. What?
Should it?

382

No. Just thought I'd toss you
a really inappropriate question.

- Your lawyer's gonna love it.
- Why would I want to sue you?
I want you to treat me.

384
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,172
- You're from Maplewood,
New Jersey, right?
- Yeah.

385
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,504
Now, why would you
drive 70 miles...

386
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:47,511
to get treatment for a condition
that a nine-year-old could diagnose?

387
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,982
It's the free-flowing pus
that's the tip-off.

388
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,951
I was in town.
Not for family.
Not for work.

389
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,353
You drove 70 miles
to a walk-in clinic.
You passed two hospitals on the road.

390
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:01,915
Either you've got a problem
with those hospitals,
or they have a problem with you.

391
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,518
My guess is you've sued
half the doctors in Maplewood,

392
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,655
and the rest are now
refusing to help you.

393
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,462
It's ironic, isn't it?
Sort of like the boy who sued wolf.

394
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,766
You know, I bet we have
a doctor here named Wolf.

395

How perfect would that be?

00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,639
- I'm gonna page him.
- Okay. You know what?
Thank you.

397
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,974
I'm gonna find a doctor
to take care of this.

398
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,980
I didn't say I wouldn't treat you.

399

- We'll drain your knee,
run some lab work. Fix you up.
- Why would you do that?

have it coming to them?

gonna have a heart attack.

That is so embarrassing.
How's your hooker doing?

406
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,134
Sweet of you to ask.
Funny story.

407
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:48,002
She was gonna be hospital
administrator, but just hated
having to screw people like that.

408
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,871
- Heard you found her on the roof.
- You have very acute hearing.

409
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,637
You notify the parents?

410
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,645
In due course, of course.

411
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:58,205
And is there a paternity bet
on the father of the patient?

412
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,582
Doesn't sound like me.
Well, it does, actually,
but doesn't mean you're guilty.

413
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,644
You think?
I saw the parents in the lobby.

414
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:08,750
- Smart money's obviously on the father.
- My guy knows a guy who can
get you in for 50 bucks.

415
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:12,729
Fine. Tell your guy, if I win,
you attend the faculty symposium,
and you wear a tie.

And if I win,
no clinic hours for a week.

- "D," see ya.

"N" for neoplastic.

- Infection.

- Oligoclonal bands still have to mean something.
- But no fevers. White count's elevated,
but within range.

- Trauma. Later much.

what those letters stand for.

It's a sick brain,
having fun,

torturing him, talking to him.

let's listen.

We're missing something.
This is screwed-up.

459
00:29:56,694 --> 00:30:00,221
That's why you came up with
the brain talking to the virus thing?

460
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,095
I panicked, okay?

461
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,967
Sounded cool though.
They bought it.

462
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,270
Oh, crap.

463
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:15,870
Another reason I don't like
meeting patients. If they don't know
what you look like, they can't yell at you.

- I'm sorry. You need to vent.
I understand.
- Don't be condescending.

in on him once.

00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,851
I know. It's terrible.
But the fact is, if I don't keep busy
with trivial things like this,

482
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,052
I'm afraid
I might start to cry.
You're an ass.

Hey. Mr. Funsten.

493
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:31,373
I was wondering
when you'd be back.
You got some papers for me?

494
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,885
You've caused me
considerable mental distress.
I certainly hope so.

your lawyer to serve it for you,

No, I don't.
Well, maybe you're right,
but I have the lab result says you do.

499
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,728
Could be a false positive,
and normally I'd run a second test,

I'll just go with the first.

The mother's not the mother either.

It's not a good idea
to move your son in his condition.

We didn't lie about anything.

517

- You, on the other hand,
accused us of molesting our son.
- Perfect.

and focus on theirs?

You're not Dan's parents.

520
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,071
We're his parents.
He was adopted.
He doesn't need to know.

521
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,132
- I do.
- Adoption makes us just as much-

522
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:09,543
Listen. When we were taking
his medical history, were you confused?

523
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,412
Did you think we were looking for
a genetic clue to his condition,

524
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:16,544
or did you think we were trying to
ascertain who loves him the most
in the whole wide world?

525
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,782
How did you find out about this?

526
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:22,257
- I sampled their D.N.A.
- We didn't give you any D.N.A.

527
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,760
Your coffee cups from the cafeteria.

528
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:28,765
- You can't do that.
- Again, why are we getting
hung up on what I did?

529
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:34,669
- Your medical history is useless.
- No. We gave you a detailed history
of his biological mother.

Dan was adopted two weeks
after he was born.

533
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,114
- You have his history. There's nothing
you need to know that we didn't tell you.
- Sounds reasonable.

534
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,245
Well, if you want to transfer
your boy, that is your choice.

535
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,017
I still think it's the wrong-
Was she vaccinated?

536
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,095
The biological mother.
When she was a baby,
did she get her vaccinations?

537
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,154
Dan was vaccinated.
At six months.

538
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,929
Mm-hmm.
Do you know why kids
get vaccinated at six months?

539
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,630
Because before that
they are protected...

540
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,299
by their biological mother's
immune system.

541
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,138
So, was she vaccinated?

542
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,678
[House]
An infant picks up
a regular old measles virus.

543
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,684
Gets a rash.

544
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:25,381
He's extremely uncomfortable,
has a wicked fever, but he lives.

545
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:29,324
Here's the kicker.
Once every million or so times,

546
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,691
the virus mutates.

547
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,287
Instead of Dan having
a fever and a rash,

548
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:37,027
the virus travels
to his brain and hides,

549
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,035
like a time bomb.

550
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,469
In this case, for 16 years.

551
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,099
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.

552
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,968
I know. There's only been
20 cases in the United States
in the last 30 years.

553
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:52,379
I suppose you could make
an argument the kid's still in stage I.

554
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,577
Once S.S.P.E. Moves
to stage II, it's-

555
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,780
Boom. Stage II is universally fatal.

556
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,824
I assume its impossible to know
when he might move into stage II.

557
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:05,090
He's already started showing symptoms.
Could be a month. Could be tonight.

558
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,393
Can we treat it?
Ask the neurologist.

559
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,558
Intraventricular interferon.

560
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:13,502
Not gonna shove a spike
into his brain and drip interferon
without confirming this diagnosis.

561
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:17,337
- Tap him.
- We won't get a reliable result
for measles antibodies in his C.S.F.

562
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,342
Not after everything
we've given him.

563
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,208
So the wrong treatment kills
any hope of the right diagnosis.

564
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,044
Why do people lie to me?

565
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,050
[Sighs]
Could also kill him.

566
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:31,555
Your ball, Foreman.
Tell me I don't have to
biopsy his brain.

567
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,217
Well, there is one other way.

568
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,785
You sure this isn't gonna hurt?

569
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,854
Yeah. It's just scary as hell.

570
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,059
See, we go through the pupil.

571
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,364
But you won't feel it.
The eye's been paralyzed.

572
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,768
The needle travels
to the back of the eye,

573
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,705
which is where we'll perform
the biopsy on your retina.

574
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,073
So we've confirmed that
the problem is this mutated virus.

575
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,950
The treatment for S.S.P.E.
Is intraventricular interferon.

576
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,750
We implant an ommaya reservoir
under the scalp,

577
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,053
which is connected to
a ventricular catheter...

578
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,685
that delivers the antiviral
directly to the left hemisphere.

579
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:14,595
You want us to consent to this?
I don't even understand
what you're talking about.

580
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,724
Well, the antiviral-

581
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,437
Look. I'm sorry.

582
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:25,874
I can explain this as best I can,
but the notion that you're gonna fully
understand your son's treatment...

583
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:30,073
and make an informed decision
is- is kind of insane.

584
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,080
Here's what you need to know.

585
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,054
It's dangerous.

586
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,351
It could kill him.

00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,414

- Tell the parents to submit

pay for a bet.

00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,674
Should. We don't make that bet,

I never would have taken their D.N.A.

597
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:39,480
Without their D.N.A., we never would have
discovered that Dan was adopted,
which was the key to this case.

That's right. It's autosomal dominant.
