The kid was just taking
his A.P. Calculus exam,

22

when all of a sudden
he got nauseous and disoriented.

That's the way calculus presents.

You don't care about the kid.
You just find his illness intriguing.

35

His CAT scan was clean.
There's no sign of infection.
It's not diabetes.

- That never happens.

think that about their children,

00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,342
and they're usually wrong.

when I was his age.

Even she thought so.

The fact that you did drugs
doesn't mean he did.

Did he go anywhere last night?

00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,832
No, he was home studying.

- And bring him drugs?

I didn't want him to know about it,
because I do trust him.

Then why did you test him?

72

and argue about his college interviews.

- Carbamates.

Are there any stronger treatments
for the organophosphate poisoning?

We went with the weak stuff.
I was just trying to save a little money.

Actually, one of my professors
at Columbia developed an experimental
treatment for the army.

- They're targeted. There's a different
hydrolase treatment for each poison.

with Orthene or malathion-

what are the kid's chances without it?

Minimal at best. The poison's
broken the blood-brain barrier.

00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,397
Okay.
Look, I got this rash
in kind of my groin region.

321
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,402
It's, um, not a symptom.

322
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,234
Neither is being obnoxious.
Looks like you're in the clear.

323
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:04,041
- So who poisoned 'em?
- We're not sure yet
if it was done on purpose.

324
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:08,246
Oh, yeah? You oughta see these little
bastards screaming and punching
each other all day long.

325
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,120
Did you happen to notice
if anyone was doing any spraying
near the bus route?

326
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,456
Oh! Yeah, there was this truck
down by the pond doing
something or other.

327
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,361
It smelled kinda funny too.

328
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,834
- Oh! Dr. House!
- Well, it took you long enough.
We've been waiting here-

329
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,433
Mr. Adams, would you
step outside for a moment?

330
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,776
Why?
Because you irritate me.

331
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,247
He is my son, Doctor.

332
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,944
He's just a little cranky
from not eating.

333
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,616
Fine. Mrs. Adams, have you had
any recent sexual activity?

334
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,626
What?

335
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:53,790
Well, l- I don't suppose
fantasies count.

336
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,628
Oh, my God.

337
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,227
Unfortunately,
I've hit kind of a dry spell.

338
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:03,070
Only for the last-
oh, I don't know- 15 years.

339
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:07,771
You see? She's- She's confused.
My father died eight years ago.
Heart attack.

340
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,076
Not in bed, dear.

341
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,450
Why do you ask?

342
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,923
Because you have tested
positive for syphilis.

343
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:23,984
That's impossible!
And insulting.

344
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,733
I don't think it's the first time
that Mom has heard this diagnosis.

345
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:37,467
"Cupid's disease."
That's what we used to call it.

346
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,238
When did you get it?

347
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:45,614
Uh, 1939. Prom night, I think.

348
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,084
He had a Chevrolet.

349
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,280
It was before I met your father.

350
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,916
But you said that-

351
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,325
You said Dad was your first love.

352
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,556
He was.

353
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:04,125
We're talking about sex.

354
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,695
But I was treated.

355
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,935
Which suppressed it-
in your case, for 60 years.

356
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:16,504
But now it's back, and
the spirochetes that cause syphilis
are eating away at your brain cells.

357
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,209
Oh! That's revolting.

358
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,549
It's not as revolting as chlamydia.
That's got seepage.

359
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,885
And it's the 21 st century.

360
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:28,448
We've got flying cars,
robot dogs and penicillin.

361
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,052
High-dose regimen
for two weeks, you're cured.

362
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,563
- I can't believe this.
- Yeah, well, pinch yourself.

363
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:38,626
I guess for the next two weeks,
I'd better practice safe sex.

364
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:45,401
You'll be fine.
Just feed that cranky kid.

365
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:55,719
The county's worried about West Nile,
so they sprayed ethyl-parathion
right next to the bus route.

366
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,415
Do you have the hydrolase
for ethyl-parathion?

367
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,391
Yeah. Only one problem. Matt's mother
faxed his records to the C.D.C.

368
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:05,190
She refuses to let us do anything
until she hears back from them.

369
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,164
Well, you're getting good
at this Godlike doctor racket.

370
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,360
Why don't you talk her
out of this lunacy?

371
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,562
She's not really
a big fan of mine.
Or mine.

372
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:17,574
Well, only one man left in the bull pen,
and he throws like a girl.

373
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,002
I hate sports metaphors.

374
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,343
Give her the high, hard one.

375
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,079
We really think
the hydrolase is the only-

376
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,280
I'm thinking about transferring
Matt out of here.

377
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,483
Ms. Davis, your son is very sick.
He won't survive a transfer.

378
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,686
I'm getting a second opinion
from the Center for Disease Control.

379
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,527
Right. Look,
when my grandmother got sick-

380
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,124
What? You're gonna tell me
some tough decision you had to make?

381
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:47,638
- I know how hard this is for you.
- Maybe embroider the story
a little? Make it fit?

382
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,197
I can't imagine being in your position.

383
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,904
Honesty. A kind of vulnerable honesty.
That's your thing. And the looks.

384
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:58,279
- Oh, boy.
- They send a single woman
to hustle the single mom.

385
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,784
Actually, they sent a doctor!

386
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,377
To tell you that if your son
doesn't get this treatment,

387
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,015
there's a good chance he'll die.

388
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:09,788
That's what House said
about a treatment
that would have killed Matt.

389
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,989
You've gotta
do better than that.
No, it's on you.

390
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,261
You need to do better.
Right now. Yes or no?

391
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,004
- I don't know.
- Figure it out.

392
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,008
Wait.

393
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,303
[Heart Monitor Beeping]

394
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,990
[Alarm Beeping]
Nurse!

395
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,126
- Help!
- Okay. Coming.

396
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,899
- Seizing. Suction.
- [Woman] Watch his head.

397
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,463
My son!

398
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,737
[Alarm Continues Beeping]

399
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,611
- [Woman] Coming.
- Diazepam.

400
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,707
Got it.

401
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,850
- Suction.
- Ten milligrams.

402
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,755
- Right.
- He's not responding.
Another 10 milligrams.

403
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,759
You're killing him!

404
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,727
- You're killing him.!
- Get her out of here. Get her outta here!

405
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:58,360
- Come on, ma'am. Ma'am?
- [Erratic Beeping]

406
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,342
[Foreman]
Their hearts are barely pumping.
Their lungs are shot.

407
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,710
Now they're showing liver toxicity.

408
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:13,114
[House]
I guess Matt's mom won't nominate us
for any Doctor of the Year awards.

409
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,642
Only explanation is
they got poisoned by something
besides ethyl-parathion.

410
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,986
Then the hydrolase
would release the neurotoxins
instead of bonding with them.

411
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,219
The only thing they have
in common is the bus.

412
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,227
Except their symptoms.
Given their severity...

413
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:28,732
and the fact their cardiac symptoms
are getting worse much faster than their
other ones, what does that tell us?

414
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,132
The poison was probably
absorbed through the skin.

415
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:34,171
They were admitted at 8:45 and 11:00.
When were they poisoned?

416
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,106
Absorption through the skin?
Anywhere from three to eight hours.

417
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,700
In a case that bad, more like
one and a half to four.

418
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,737
So Matt was poisoned before 7:15.
Before he got on the bus.

419
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:48,445
You're thinking each kid
got poisoned in his own house?
Two separate exposures?

420
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,785
What do teenage boys do
in the morning, besides the obvious?

421
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,552
Wake up, go to the bathroom,

422
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,720
then the obvious,
then check their zits in the mirror.

423
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,664
- Do they both use the same acne cream?
- Because acne cream contains lanolin,

424
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,964
which could have pesticides,
and you're thinking they both
bought the same product-

425
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,699
- It was contaminated. Shaving cream.
- Chi doesn't look like he shaves.

426
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,934
But he sweats.
Deodorant could contain lanolin.

427
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,069
Do these people have animals?
Chi has a dog. Matt has a cat.

428
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,239
[Cameron]
Fleas. Flea powder.
Okay. Go to their houses.

429
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,146
Check for anything that
might have touched their skin...

430
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,412
between the time they got up
and the time they went to school.

431
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,784
I'm running low on tomato sauce.

432
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:29,054
[Panting]
Oh! Dr. House! Hello.

433
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:33,325
- I sent you home.
- Well, I came back.

434
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,390
I took a cab,

435
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:40,267
so my son wouldn't try
to chaperone us this time.

436
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,637
I'm sorry, but... the fact
that the sexual pleasure center...

437
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,575
of your cerebral cortex
has been overstimulated by spirochetes is-

438
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:51,672
It's a poor basis for a relationship.
I learned that one the hard way.

439
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:57,345
Doctor, um, these feelings
that I've been having-

440
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,118
Is it all because of the syphilis?

441
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,453
Yes.

442
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:08,225
Then... here's the prescription
you gave me.

443
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,800
Well, it's not likely
I'm going to infect anyone.

444
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,709
No, but it'll kill you.

445
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,106
Well, gotta go sometime,

446
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,377
and...
[Sighs]

447
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:31,184
I really don't want to play
canasta for the rest of my life.

448
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:35,352
L- I like feeling sexy again...

449
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:41,023
and... making a fool out of myself
with handsome, young doctors.

450
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,932
[Laughs]

451
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:47,438
Do you think that
I would have given you this...

452
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,303
if it would stop you
from flirting with me?

453
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:54,402
Well, but if I'm cured-
Then all the spirochetes will die off.

454
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:59,974
But the little pieces of your cerebral cortex
that have been destroyed won't grow back.

455
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,219
You're brain damaged.

456
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,224
Doomed to feeling good
for the rest of your life.

457
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,522
[Laughing]

458
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,325
Really? Well, thank you.

459
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,263
Georgia.

460
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,268
Yeah.
[Sighs]

461
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,271
When I stop being contagious,

462
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,274
I'll come by for a checkup.

463
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,013
[Sighs]
Yeah.

464
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,118
- Matt uses Sure.
- Chi uses Old Spice.

465
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,623
- No zit cream.
- Lucky kid.

466
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,559
Floral air freshener.
Doesn't matter.

467
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,564
When was the last time you heard
of a teenage boy using air freshener?

468
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,566
Pert shampoo.

469
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,727
Um, Johnson's over here.

470
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,064
Matt's mom would make him
use air freshener.

471
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,801
There are limits
to a mother's power. Even hers.

472
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,775
Just check.

473
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,640
Negative on the floral.

474
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,649
Matt's A.L.T.'s are up to 800.

475
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,982
If they get any higher,
we can toss his liver.
[Phone Ringing]

476
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,079
- Yeah.
- No matches on flea powder
or underarm deodorant.

477
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,784
- Or any other kind of deodorant.
- What about shampoo?

478
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,693
No to shampoo, bar soap,
dish soap, dish detergent.

479
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,755
How about laundry detergent?
Maybe they both washed
their clothes this morning.

480
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,960
I'll check.
[Foreman]
You know, if we cure Matt,

481
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:27,198
he can use his close brush with death
on his college essays.

482
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:30,001
- Admission guys love that stuff.
- That's how you got in, right?

483
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,269
Jailhouse diary?

484
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,472
Uh, TKO.

485
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:41,143
TKO. Liquid?

486
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,449
Liquid, 128 ounces.

487
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,979
- 128. Yellow jug. "Special"-
- "Environmentally safe formula."

488
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,151
It's the same.
Bring in the detergent.

489
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,923
So the detergent was
contaminated with pesticides?

490
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,988
Which soaked into their clothes
and got absorbed into their skin.

491
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,364
Hi. Uh, listen, the clothes
your son wore today-

492
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,271
- He washed them this morning, right?
- What?

493
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,777
Nice, respectful Asian kid
does the laundry.

494
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:10,177
[Speaking Chinese]
My wife said he didn't.

495
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,350
Well, then I'm betting he washed them
last night without you knowing.

496
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,720
[Speaking Chinese]
He doesn't even know
how to turn on the machine.

497
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,784
And those clothes were new.
Nobody washed them.
His clothes are all new?

498
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,989
The ones he wore today, yes.
Never washed.

499
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,073
Now what?

500
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,445
What about Matt's clothes?
Were they new?

501
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,573
Uh, they're ratty old jeans,
I think.

502
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,584
They've been bagged
and taken downstairs.

503
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,297
"Davis."
Yeah, they're Matt's.

504
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,602
And they're old.

505
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,367
And yet the label
isn't faded in the slightest.

506
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,103
Fake old. Hundred dollars
for the homeless look.

507
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:16,704
What? Kids aren't
pretentious in England?

508
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,081
Chi was wearing a different brand.
How could they both
have been contaminated?

509
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:25,020
That is the question for the ages.
Meantime, get these tested.

[Beeping]

511
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,854
I never bother to wash
new clothes before I wear them.

512
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:02,052
Right. Your wife does. She likes you
feeling nice and comfortable.

513
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:05,289
Hey, I'm a man.
I don't have time for laundry.

514
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,888
I'm saving lives here.

515
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,456
No, she doesn't wash them either.

516
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:15,131
So your skin absorbs a little dye,
the odd chemical here and there.

517
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,606
You know me-
Mr. Living On The Edge.

518
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:21,133
Judging by the self-importance
of your strut, you have identified
the chemical in question.

519
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,340
- Phosdrin.
- Hit 'em with the hydrolase.

520
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:28,010
- Chi's parents said yes, but-
- Mighty Mom said no.

521
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:33,022
Well, she's gonna feel like a million bucks
when Chi lives and her son dies.

522
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,754
Send Cameron. She's the only one of you
who's managed to talk her into anything.

523
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:41,423
Not this time. Matt's mom
won't make a move until she gets
that opinion from the C.D.C.

- [TV: Soap Opera]

529
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,345
Then I could give Matt
the medicine right away.

[Sighs]
Don't worry. I've got time.

531
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,827
The C.D.C. Promised they'd call.

532
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,830
I'm sure they will.

533
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,163
Maybe tomorrow.
Maybe the day after.

534
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:54,068
It takes time
to review faxed records.

535
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:58,837
Then they'll probably tell you
they can't make a decision
based on faxed records.

you're right this time?

does first, that's okay.

there's a real good chance-

00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:28,100
- What? Matt might kick off?
- That's a little blunt.

00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,299
I was gonna say "run out of time"...

When he wasn't busy
as a clothing entrepreneur,

he did day labor
at a cornfield out on Route 1.

He used the same truck
for both jobs.

So he spilled pesticide on the pants
and was too lazy to clean up.
