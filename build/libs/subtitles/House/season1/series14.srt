00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:09,735
Where are those projections?
Three, six and nine
are in their folders.

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,277
Can I have some more-
Excellent.
Tea's at your seat. Hello.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,246
Oh, hold on.

6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,113
Ben Federman again,
another pre-call.

7
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:22,780
[Phone Beeps]
We did the pre-call.
Is this the post pre-call call?

8
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,381
[Federman]
The board's gonna want specifics
with the push into the Asian markets.

9
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,392
Ben, there are no specifics
about Asia.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,985
We came up with that
as a Hail Mary at 3:00 in the morning...

11
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,054
to placate the board
about international.

12
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,191
[Federman]
Carly, I'm just giving you
a heads-up about Asia.

13
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,469
There is no Asia.

14
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,872
Let's talk about Asia.

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,138
We're in the preliminary stages
of forming a strategic alliance
with Credit Lyonnais.

16
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,477
Within three months,
you won't be able to walk four feet
in Kangham, South Korea...

17
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,483
without seeing
one of our beautiful models...

18
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,783
smiling at you from billboards
and drugstore windows,
inviting you in.

19
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:59,484
That's incredible news, Carly.
We'd hoped to hear
something about Asia.

20
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,153
Had no idea
plans were so far along.

21
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,992
Well, you know Asia.
Nothing's done until it's done.

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,592
- [All Laughing]
- [Man]
Carly, I was wondering,

23
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,159
could you walk us through
what you were thinking
for other Asian territories?

24
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,638
Absolutely. India has over
half a billion women.

25
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,609
In terms of spending power,
it's the single largest potential market
in the world.

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,287
Um, we have retained a local firm
to ensure that cultural differences
are respected.

27
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:36,351
Um, however, I can't
go into the specifics of my plan
with you until tomorrow.

28
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,363
Right now I have a meeting
and I need the room.

29
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,763
We were just getting started.

30
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,031
I know and I do apologize.
It's last minute,

31
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,596
but the meeting is with
three state department officials
to smooth the way for China.

32
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:51,041
China?
This is just incredible.

33
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,545
- We'll be in touch.
- Thank you.

34
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,146
What is it?
I need a doctor.

35
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,811
I can't move my leg.

36
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,456
32-year-old female, paralysis
and severe pain in her right quad. Go.

37
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,897
- How'd she get to you?
- She's the C.E.O. Of Sonyo Cosmetics.

38
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,332
Three assistants and 15 V.P.'s
checked out who should be treating her.

39
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,428
Who da man? I da man.
I always suspected.

40
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,997
Dr. House, I know
the chances are very slim,
but I'm sure you recognize...

41
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,203
that she may have what you had,
a clot in her thigh.

42
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,338
A bit of a long shot.

43
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,440
- What about a disk herniation?
- I don't know, Eric.

44
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,782
If her disk were herniated,
she'd present with pain elsewhere,
wouldn't she?

45
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,013
- Yeah, I suppose.
- You're right.

46
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,957
A clot's also the most deadly,
right, Robert?

47
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,827
True. The clot breaks off,
she could stroke and die.

48
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,798
Dr. House,
I believe that they're right-

49
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,030
- Stop talking.
- What?

50
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,504
You read one of those
negotiating books, didn't you?

51
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:33,171
Getting To Yes.
Fifty Ways to Win an Argument.
Hitchhiker's Guide to Being a Pal.

52
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:37,740
In five seconds,
you just manipulated these two
into agreeing with your point of view.

53
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,149
Fellas, this is known
as soft positional bargaining.

54
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,689
It's not gonna work.

55
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,224
Dr. House, are you saying
that she doesn't have a clot,

56
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,420
or are you saying
that if she does have a clot,

57
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,725
she doesn't need blood thinners
and an angiogram?

58
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,668
Chase, put her on blood thinners.
Do an angiogram.

59
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,297
When that comes back negative,
M.R.I. The spine.

60
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,035
If that's clean,
cut her open and biopsy the leg.

61
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:08,240
Excellent suggestion.
Read less, more TV.

62
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,283
[Cuddy]
It's rare for an individual
to make a donation...

63
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:16,687
significant enough
to impact an organization
as large and unwieldy as a hospital.

64
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,283
This donation
does come with one string,

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,521
that he be made
chairman of the board.

66
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,326
I think that's a reasonable request.
I think he should have the right to know...

67
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,268
what it is we do
with his $ 100 million.

68
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,931
Please welcome
our new chairman of the board,
Edward Vogler.

69
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:38,205
- [Applause]
- Thank you.

70
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,940
Thank you.

71
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,381
[Sighs] When I was 18,

72
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,543
my dad loaned me $20,000
for a college tuition,

73
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:52,023
which he would have known was a mistake
had he known I wasn't actually in college.

74
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:57,723
[Sighs] I took his money and invested
in a friend who had a little business.

75
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,732
And when my dad found out
what I had done with his money,

76
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,258
he and I didn't talk much
after that.

77
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,271
But my friend's business took off,

78
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,935
and I used the profits from that
to buy another company and another.

79
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,604
And I must have been pretty good at it,
had a good eye,

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,013
because before I knew it,
people were making offers for my company.

81
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,711
And about a year ago,
I went public,

82
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,017
and overnight
I was worth a billion dollars.

83
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,523
So, I went to see my dad.

84
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,994
I'll admit. I wanted a little payback.
You know, kind of shove
the win in his face.

85
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,396
So, I drove upstate,
and sat in the kitchen I grew up in,

86
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,902
and, uh, he had no reaction.

87
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,899
It wasn't his fault.
He didn't even know who I was,

88
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,342
because his Alzheimer's
had taken a turn for the worse,

89
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,210
despite the best drugs
and care out there.

90
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,842
And that is why I'm here.

91
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,184
What if my contribution to this hospital
is the difference between...

92
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,122
no cure and a cure for cancer?

93
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,390
The difference between
a man not recognizing
his wife of 35 years...

94
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:08,730
and being able to look at her and say,
"Good morning, honey. I love you."

95
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,171
If there's a disease out there
killing people,

96
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,141
I am writing you a blank check
to fight back.

97
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,178
So, things are going to change a lot.

98
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,886
[Mouthing Words]

99
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,825
We're gonna have to ask you
for the cell phone.

100
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,659
Do what you need to do.
I'm okay.

101
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,859
I'm pretty sure my X-ray machine
can take your phone in a fight.

102
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,927
It'll fry it.

103
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,439
Fine.

104
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,241
- How old is she?
- Thirty-two.

105
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,440
Wow. And she's already
the C.E.O. Of a public company.

106
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:00,213
She's a workaholic.
Okay, Carly, hold still.

107
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,516
The X-ray machine
is gonna pass over your leg.

108
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,250
[Carly] Okay.
What'd you do with your time off?

109
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,383
Snowboarding in Gstaad.

110
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,394
Switzerland.

111
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,293
Do you ski or board?
You can come with if you like.

112
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,027
Maybe we should start with a drink
before we go around the world.

113
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,264
Oh, you wanna have
a drink with me?

114
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,306
Oh, very aggressive.
I like that.

115
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,839
I wanna run this place
like a business.

116
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,815
What, you want to put
more vending machines
in the hallway?

117
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,750
Maybe a roulette wheel?
Nice one.
But I'm serious.

118
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,415
The product that
you're selling is good health.
It shouldn't be a tough sell.

119
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,926
If you don't wanna sell,
it means you don't care
if people get your product.

120
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,554
You care if people are healthy,
or are you too proud for that?

121
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,459
Who's that?

122
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,937
Oh, that's just
one of our doctors.

123
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,775
Aren't, uh, doctors
supposed to wear lab coats?

124
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,179
- He's different.
- Everyone's buddy.

125
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:07,345
- No, not exactly.
- Then why does he get away with it?

126
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,255
It's just a coat.
He's very good.

127
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,294
Hmm.

128
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,331
- Say '"Ah."
- Ah.

129
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,800
Now really belt it out,
like you're gonna throw up.
Ahh!

130
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,704
[Coughs]
Perfect.

131
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,037
Okay, that's it.

132
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:33,601
We should know in a couple of days
what's growing in your son's throat.

133
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,509
Hello?

134
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:42,020
- He can't talk.
- Excuse me?

135
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,216
- He had knee surgery.
- Right?

136
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,987
About a year ago,
and then he couldn't talk.

137
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,188
Right.
Yeah, well, that happens.

138
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,792
You know, it's very dangerous
operating so close to the vocal cords.

139
00:08:55,868 --> 00:09:00,828
Okay. Well, we'll send
your kid's culture to the lab
and somebody will call you.

140
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,171
- Boo!
- [Boy Yells]

141
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:11,709
Just wanted to see if your dad,
you know- Bizarre.

142
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,549
I need you to wear
your lab coat.

143
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:22,526
I need two days of outrageous sex
with someone obscenely younger
than you, like half your age.

144
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,722
Wear the coat.

145
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,732
Man, oh, man,
someone got spanked
real good this morning.

146
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,530
A guy gives $100 million
to cure cancer.

147
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,003
A pretty small concession
to wear a lab coat.

148
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,199
Cure cancer?

149
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,266
Is the hospital getting
out of the dull business
of treating patients?

150
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,471
You know that's not
what he's doing.
I know exactly what he's doing.

151
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,673
He's using us to run
clinical trials.

152
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,184
Oh, shame on him,
saving lives like that.

153
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,119
It's unethical.

154
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:52,316
Oh, are you coming in too?
I thought I had you convinced.

155
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,882
Clinical trials
save thousands of lives.

156
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,952
He's using patients as guinea pigs.

157
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,691
Pharmaceutical companies
do that every day.

158
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,962
Are we a pharmaceutical company?
We're gonna wind up pressuring
desperate patients...

159
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,230
into choices that are
bad for them, good for us.

160
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,762
We're gonna compromise
patient care.
Who the hell am I talking to?

161
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,207
Suddenly ethical lapses
are a major concern for you?

162
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,769
What's interesting is
it suddenly doesn't bother you.

163
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,049
So, if you ignore ethics
to save one person it's admirable,

164
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,280
but if you do it to save
a thousand, you're a bastard.

165
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,620
All he's done is taken your game
and gone pro.

166
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,596
He's not gonna kill a few patients.
He's gonna kill this hospital.

167
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,861
It took him three seconds
to size you up.

168
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,732
And surprise,
he doesn't like you.

169
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,931
Wear the damn coat.

170
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:51,410
Hello. I'm, uh, Dr. Foreman.
I work with Dr. House.

171
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,418
Our initial tests say you're fine.

172
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,580
We think you had a clot,
but it resolved on its own.

173
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,183
So, we're gonna keep you
overnight to be safe,
and you can go back home tomorrow...

174
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,784
or back to work.

175
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,491
Hey, are you okay?
[Sobbing]

176
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,796
[Screams]

177
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,828
Get in here!
I need a line in her.
I.V. Morphine, stat!

178
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:19,935
[Screams, Sobbing]

179
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,351
You get any read
on the new chairman of the board?

180
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,685
- Yeah, he took your parking space.
- It's not necessarily bad news.

181
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,951
Do you ever watch
Gilligan's Island reruns...

182
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,926
and really, really think
they're gonna get off
the island this time?

183
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,098
We should introduce ourselves.
It couldn't hurt.

184
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:45,468
Make him a Bundt cake.
A patient hit a 10 on the pain scale.
What would explain that?

185
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,631
There was no clot in her leg.
The angio was totally clean.

186
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,402
What about the muscle biopsy?

187
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,705
No neurogenic
or myopathic abnormalities.

188
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:56,612
She was also negative for trichinosis.
No toxoplasmosis
or polyarteritis nodosa.

189
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,082
Robert, what was
her sedimentation rate?

190
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,153
Normal, Allison.

191
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,054
Therefore, no inflammation,
no immunologic response.

192
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,718
Do you mind sharing
that number with me?

193
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,784
Fifteen, Allison.

194
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,127
- Are you mocking me?
- Duh, Allison.

195
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,226
I'm just suggesting
we look outside the box.
What ifher sed rate is elevated?

196
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:21,399
Well, let's go further outside the box.
Let's say the angio revealed a clot.

197
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,772
And then let's say
we treated that clot,

198
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,936
and now she's all better
and personally thanked me
by performing-

199
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,911
My Aunt Elyssa
lives in Philadelphia.

200
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,916
Oh, it's story time.
Let me get my "baba."

201
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:36,080
Her normal temperature is 96.2,
not 98.6 like you and me.

202
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,521
If her temperature were 98.6,
she'd have a fever.

203
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,587
I'm just wondering if you think
we could apply the same logic
to Carly's sed rate.

204
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,925
It's absurd.

205
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,526
I love it.

206
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,300
[Cameron]
If 15 is high for Carly,
then she has inflammation.

207
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,672
Which could, in turn, mean cancer.
I'll talk to Wilson.

208
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,840
Next time, skip Aunt Elyssa.

209
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,382
You're probably talking about
a primary bone cancer.

210
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,714
It could be tricky to detect.
We'll need a bone scan.

211
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,947
That's why I'm talking
to an oncologist.

212
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:14,015
Sure. I've nothing better to do
besides departmental meetings
and budget reports.

213
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,688
New chairman of the board,
you know.
Oh, I hadn't heard.

214
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,630
Right. Clinical trials.
Completely unethical.

215
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,965
And a very bad omen for you.
There's not much money in curing
African sleeping sickness.

216
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,131
No. I have seen
every scary movie ever made.

217
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,266
Six-year-old twins
in front of an elevator of blood.

218
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,572
Boys' choirs.
Those are bad omens.

219
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,741
This is much more mundane.
A billionaire wants to get laid.

220
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,046
Billionaires buy movie studios
to get laid.

221
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,052
They buy hospitals
to get respect.

222
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,248
And the reason you want respect?
To get laid.

223
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,655
Okay then.
Just gotta think like a billionaire.

224
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,387
Let's see.
There'll be big,
scary changes and then,

225
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:54,558
"Oh, Dr. Cameron, we should have dinner
to discuss your future on my G5 private jet."

226
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,931
Come on. You know
how good you have it here.

227
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,301
Yes, I'm the big poobah,
the big cheese, the go-to guy.

228
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,772
You do the cases you wanna do
when you wanna do them.

229
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,367
You're not gonna have that
anywhere else.
Relax.

230
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,038
I've been through
three regime changes in this hospital.
Every time same story.

231
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,673
Just keep your head down.
That's all I'm saying.

232
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,241
And put on your coat.
It itches.

233
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,778
[Sighs]
So, you gonna do this bone scan
for me, or what?

234
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,018
Yes.

235
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:35,905
Dr. Simpson, did you hear?
New management.

236
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,375
I'm thinking of switching
to orthopedics.

237
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,437
How much do you guys
get for a massage now?
Without the happy ending.

238
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:46,041
Dr. House, what do you want?
Do you remember a guy
named Van Der Meer?

239
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,450
Not a big talker.
You fixed his A.C.L.

240
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,488
No, not according
to my medical malpractice premiums.

241
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,685
Didn't get hypotensive
during surgery?

242
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,558
No strokes?
Maybe some connectivity loss?

243
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,360
What, you're gonna
get involved now?
I'm not involved.

244
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,663
A guy brought his son
into the clinic.
I didn't touch the son.

245
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,398
I'm not taking
any responsibility there.
The son's fine. Can't shut him up.

246
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:10,169
Dad show any symptoms
of cortical disease? Wernicke's?

247
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,042
No. Nothing.

248
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,048
That's why we settled
because we couldn't find anything.

249
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,346
The guy got over a million dollars.
Don't tell me he's complaining.

250
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,909
He's not saying boo.

251
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,321
Your father wants to know
when you'll be back from your trip.

252
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,761
E-mail back
it's taking longer than I thought.

253
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,697
He doesn't need to
see me like this.
What about your brother?

254
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,703
- No.
- Hello. I'm Dr. Wilson. I was-

255
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,137
- Um, Robin, I'm gonna need a minute.
- Oh.

256
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,870
Thank you.
[Clears Throat]

257
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,050
There are two Dr. Wilsons
in this hospital,

258
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,849
one in ophthalmology
and one in cancer.

259
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:01,950
My eyes are fine,
so I'm guessing you're here
to tell me that I have cancer.

260
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,689
There is no cancer in your bone.

261
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,697
You're not smiling.

262
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,696
There's something called referred pain.
You could have cancer
in one part of your body...

263
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,034
that presents in another.

264
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,075
Given your age
and your family history,
I'm thinking your colon.

265
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,235
[Scoffs]
Great.

266
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:25,843
I was at Columbia
when my mom died.
Now there's a blast.

267
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,682
Cleaning up her vomit,
and then running to my econ final.

268
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,881
Look.
[Chuckles]

269
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,823
If I'm a short-timer, give me drugs.
I'll go back to work. I'll die there.

270
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:37,988
Whoa. There's a very quick test
to see if you even have it-
a colonoscopy.

271
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,157
[Chuckles]
I know how you do that test.

272
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,896
If you have colon cancer,
we can treat it. It's early.

273
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,497
That's what they told my mom.
She was dead six months later.

274
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:55,172
You're a smart person
about to make a very bad decision.

275
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,341
You know, cancer treatment's
come a long way in 12 years,
but if you don't do this now-

276
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,851
I don't wanna be looked at.

277
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,124
There is another way.

278
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,632
We could do a virtual colonoscopy.

279
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:20,229
Basically, we do a C. T. Scan
of your colon. It's noninvasive.

280
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,433
But it's very expensive.
I'm assuming that's not a problem.

281
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,314
Say yes.

282
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,920
[Woman On P.A.]
Dr. Becker-

283
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,688
Mr. Van Der Meer.

284
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,953
[Typing]
What?

285
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:49,326
Relax.
Ricky's gonna be just "finkf."
Strep throat.

286
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,893
Here's a prescription
for an antibiotic. He should
be all better in a few days.

287
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:56,930
Although,
this might sting a little.

288
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,086
I wanna see you again
real soon.

289
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,026
[Wilson]
Virtual colonoscopy was clean.

290
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,155
No colon cancer.

291
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,358
What happened to our regular,
old-fashioned colonoscopy?

292
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,335
She was uncomfortable
doing any more tests.
I had to convince her to do that one.

293
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:29,465
Do you get that often?
Women would rather die
than get naked with you?

294
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,805
She's scared.

295
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:37,042
But not of tests.
Just embarrassing ones.

296
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,845
Yeah.

297
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:47,687
It's not an inflammatory process.
It's not a clot, because Chase's
angio says so.

298
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,389
And it's not cancer,
because her tush is perfect.

299
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,298
Anybody else got an Aunt Elyssa
with weird stuff?

300
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,735
Maybe it's worth looking into-

301
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,036
I thought you said
Carly's angio was clean.

302
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,544
It was clean.

303
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,886
You guys see
the problem here?

304
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:21,184
There's no indication
of any abnormalities.

305
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,194
No lesions,
no spurs, no mastis-

306
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:27,756
Her toes are screwed up.
They're backwards.

307
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,166
You guys know how much surgery
it's gonna take to swap 'em back?

308
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,999
What are you talking about?

309
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:37,201
Well, either she literally
has two left feet,
or you angioed the wrong leg.

310
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,011
That's impossible.
It can't be-
Or maybe it was Jenny.

311
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:51,044
How come some resident
signed this radiology report?
Were you even in the room?

312
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,182
- I'll redo her angio-
- You'll do nothing!

313
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,224
Foreman,
you do the angiogram.

314
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,479
I can't believe I did that.

315
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,877
Why do we have to
redo the angiogram?

316
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,391
There was a shadow
on the first test result.
Shadow?

317
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,718
A shadow means
there could be a blood clot, right?

318
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,422
I read Conn's Current Therapy.

319
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:38,299
A real page-turner.
No, it wasn't that kind of shadow.

320
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,105
My chest hurts.
It's from the tracer I injected.

321
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:49,011
You might also get a little nauseous
or have a metallic taste.
All normal.

322
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,141
I'm a runner.
I shouldn't feel like this.

323
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,515
Carly, I'm looking
at your vitals right now and-

324
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,577
I can't breathe.
Carly?

325
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,984
My chest.

326
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,296
My chest.

327
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,998
Respiratory arrest.
Call code.

328
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,299
- What do you got?
- She's drowning.

329
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,092
[Cameron]
Foreman did a thoracentesis
to drain the fluid from her lungs.

330
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,686
She's stable.
They sent the fluid to the lab.
It'll be back in a few hours.

331
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:42,495
You'll be happy to know
Chase's mistake didn't cost her.
Angio revealed no clot.

332
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,736
I'm thrilled.

333

[Monitor Beeping]

334
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,938
Okay, see, now you'rejust
being stubborn.

335
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,674
It's cold.
It's a perfectly good excuse
to wear your lab coat.

336
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,682
Carly needs a heart transplant.

337
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,713
Thoracentesis revealed
a transudate?

338
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,949
I haven't gotten it back yet.

339
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:48,288
Her MUGA scan,
what was the ejection fraction?

340
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,126
Maybe you could treat it surgically.
I haven't done the MUGA.

341
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,495
How do you know
she needs a heart transplant?

342
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,534
I got my aura read today.

343
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,070
It said someone close to me
had a broken heart.

344
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,572
Since when do I need
the secret pass code to talk to you?

345
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:06,008
I can't tell you anything.
Professional responsibility.

346
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,136
Like that matters to you.

347
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,182
Not my professional
responsibility, yours.

348
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,774
New regime.
You gotta keep
your head down too.

349
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,412
Now that's good thinking,
because I was gonna go
right to Cuddy...

350
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,422
and rat you out
as soon as you were done talking.

351
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,822
I'm not saying you want to.
I'm saying you'd be obligated to.

352
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,326
Because of my position
on the board?

353
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,900
Because of my position
on the transplant committee?

354
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,238
Hey, you brought this up for a reason.
You need to talk to me.

355
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,673
I can't.

356
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,778
You sure you're doing the right thing?

357
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,250
I've come up with a few
really great rationalizations.

358
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,254
Sorry to interrupt.
We have a problem.

359
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,517
[Cameron]
Thoracentesis revealed a transudate.

360
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,856
We did an echo.
She's in severe congestive heart failure.

361
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:59,192
She needs a heart transplant.

362
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,866
- We'll get her on the list immediately.
- She's already on the list.

363
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:12,606
- [Knocks]
- Come in.

364
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,843
Thanks.

365
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,975
What is a department
of Diagnostic Medicine?

366
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,878
That's Dr. House's department.

367
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:27,413
They deal with cases
that other doctors can't figure out.

368
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,620
It's a financial black hole.

369
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,890
The department costs us
three million a year...

370
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,455
to treat one patient a week.

371
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,502
He saves one patient per week.
What about everyone else?

372
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,003
His department's not going to find
the cure for breast cancer.

373
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:43,438
- Uh, maybe not, but-
- Are you sleeping with House?

374
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:47,239
What? No.
But you did. Right?

375
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,042
A long time ago?

376
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,174
That's an incredibly
inappropriate question.

377
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,653
If your judgment is compromised
by a prior or current relationship,
that is my business.

378
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,189
I respect him.
That is all you need to know.

379
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,691
He's still not wearing the coat.

380
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,524
Well, I told him-
I'm sure you did.

381
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:09,192
And yet he's not wearing it.
I'm just wondering if that's
a reflection on him...

382
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,292
or on you.

383
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,536
[Monitor Beeping]

384
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,850
You're Dr. House.

385
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,354
I found a picture online
of you at a conference.
You need a heart transplant.

386
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,224
- I run. I work out-
- You cut yourself.

387
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,562
Probably highly ritualized.

388
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,157
You play the same Sarah McLachlan song
over and over while you do it.

389
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,531
Probably works better
than antidepressants.

390
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:50,073
- I don't understand how that-
- You're a high-powered bulimic.
You make yourself throw up.

391
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:56,478
You had to find the most efficient way
to vomit without revealing
the telltale signs ofbulimia,

392
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,143
which is all, ooh,
very unseemly for a C.E.O.

393
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:05,155
So, you found a common antidote
to accidental poisoning to do the job-

394
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,157
Ipecac.

395
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:10,353
Which is great if your kid's
just swallowed a bottle of aspirin,

396
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,828
but really, really bad
if it's a habit.

397
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,066
It causes muscle damage.

398
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,295
It caused the pain in your leg.

399
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,271
And destroyed your heart.

400
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,401
How often do you do it?

401
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,419
Three times a week.

402
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:44,187
In about an hour,
there's gonna be an emergency meeting
of the transplant committee...

403
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,959
to discuss where you fall on the list
should a new heart become available.

404
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:52,732
Problem is, I am required
to tell the committee about your bulimia.

405
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:57,969
It's a major psychiatric condition.
Ranks right up there with suicidal.
Makes you a very bad risk.

406
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:02,275
So, you're here to tell me
I have just a few hours to live?

407
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,042
Unless I lie to the committee.

408
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,318
But if they find out,
I lose my medical license.

409
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,189
This would be a very good time
to offer me a bribe.

410
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,822
You know, how much is your life worth?
How much is my job worth?

411
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:25,097
Why are you here
doing this to me?
What do you want?

412
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,630
I wanna know what's right.

413
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,733
Am I worth it?

414
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,412

the way that she looks.

Oh, stop hiding!

418
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,817
I'm asking you
if you wanna live or die?
You can't even say that.

What do you
want me to do? Cry?
Yes.

420
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,287
I want you to tell me
that your life is important to you,
because I don't know.

422
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:04,437
Because that's what's
on the table right now-
your life.

423
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,320
I don't wanna die.

424
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,632
I don't.

425
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,799
This 32-year-old female
was admitted by my staff...

426
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,608
because of paralysis
and pain in her right thigh.

427
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,379
The patient rapidly deteriorated
and now has severe congestive
heart failure.

428
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,421
Pressors and vasodilators
have not improved
her condition whatsoever.

429
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:54,356
Pulmonary function tests
show an F.E.C. Of over three liters,

430
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:58,156
with F.E. V. -1
of at least 90% of predicted...

431
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:02,928
and preserved F.E.D. /F.E.C. Ratio
and preserved D.L.C.O. As well.

432
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:08,871
Her MUGA had an ejection fraction of 19%
with no focal wall motion abnormalities.

433
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,003
Heart catheterization revealed
clean left, right and circumflex arteries.

434
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:18,276
And a subsequent biopsy revealed
irreversible cardiomyopathy.

435
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,647
Which is why we're here.

436
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:24,449
Uh, Dr. House, I'm confused
by your time and date stamps.

437
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:28,219
It appears that you put Carly
on the transplant list
before you did these tests.

438
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,262
I had a hunch.

439
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,959
You don't have hunches.
You know.

440
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,197
Look, if the tests
had come back differently,
obviously I would have taken her off the list.

441
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,204
But on the long shot-

442
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,977
On the long shot that I was right,
I didn't want to waste time.

443
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,614
Is there any exclusion criteria
we should know about?

444
00:30:55,954 --> 00:31:00,050
CAT scan revealed no tumors,
and Dr. Wilson found no trace of cancer.

445
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,492
What about any other criteria?

446
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,895
- No atherosclerotic vascular disease.
- Are there any-

447
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:12,665
No pneumonia, no bacteremia.
No hep "B" or "C"
or any other letters.

448
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,830
Substance abuse.
Any history-

449
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,840
No alcohol. No drugs.

450
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:21,106
Any psychiatric conditions?
History of depression?
She's a little blue.

451
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,115
But turns out
she needs a heart transplant, so-

452
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:35,119
Dr. House, if you subvert
or mislead this committee,

453
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,094
you will be subject
to disciplinary action.

454
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,534
Dr. Cuddy, do you have reason
to think that I would lie?

455
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:50,165
I simply want you
to answer the question.

456
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,642
Is there anything
on the recipient exclusion criteria...

457
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:57,875
that would disqualify your patient
from getting a heart?

458
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,958
No.

I never lie.
Big mistake.

against putting her on the list.

- Oh, geez, have some backbone.
