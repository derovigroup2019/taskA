1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,694
It's all about the tongue, man.
You stick it in their mouth,

2
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,575
but not all the way.

3
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,577
They like that?
Dude, they love it.

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,975
What are you doing?
Climbing.

5
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:25,016
Just deep enough to lick her teeth:
Slow, one at a time,
like you're painting them.

6
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,060
This girl Rachel, she's a junior.

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,564
- She's experienced.
- Mom says I gotta be home by 5:00.

8
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:36,068
Just chill, okay? And hop the fence
before someone sees you.

9
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:48,578
Are you sure this is okay?
Dave's mom's a Realtor.
If it's for sale and empty, it's a clubhouse.

10
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:52,948
And if you say anything, you're dead.

11
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:58,252
I told them you were cool.
These are very serious dudes.

12
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,385
Come on.

13
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,761
Cub Scout meeting's
down the street, boys.
[Chuckles]

14
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,300
[Grunting]

15
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,667
What a loser.
[Laughing]
Lame.

16
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,764
- Gabe's cool, man.
He's one of us.
- [Boy] He better be.

17
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,272
Uh, I'm not thirsty.

18
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,247
- What's this?
- [Boy] Club business, little man.

19
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,981
- What shall we ask?
- Put your hands on.

20
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:36,695
O dark spirit, will any of us die
in the year to come?

21
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:47,271
- You're moving it.
- Put your hands back. Now.

22
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,973
Who among us will die?

23
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,815
"G,"

24
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,553
"A"-

25
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,495
Oh, man.

26
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,692
"B,"

27
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,240
"E."

28
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,641
[Dave]
"Gabe. '"
[Boy] That blows.

29
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:30,046
[Coughing]

30
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,512
That's it. We're going to the hospital.
[Continues Coughing]

31
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:41,185
- No, Mom. I'm too tired.
- Come on, sweetie.
You've had a fever for almost a week now.

32
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,252
[Coughing]

33
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,598
- Ow.
- Oh, my God.

34
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,571
Oh, Gabe.
Are you okay?

35
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,167
Are you okay?
Baby, what's wrong?

36
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:02,044
[Breathing Heavily]
I'm dying.

37
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:48,459
[Coughing, Wheezes]

38
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,691
[Cuddy]
Twelve-year-old male.
Spiking fever, congested chest,

39
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,959
coughing up green sputum,
pain in breathing.

40
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:59,266
Baffling, though I vaguely recall a disease
called "meunomia"? "Pneumania"?

41
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:04,572
But his chest X-ray and C.T. Scan
show an atypical pattern for pneumonia.
Pneumonia! That's it.

42
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,738
Just a guess here,
but his parents big donors?

43
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:11,272
No infiltrate,
just enlarged hilar lymph nodes.

44
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,843
Tiny unicorns goring his bronchial tubes
would be cooler,

45
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:19,654
and the way you're ignoring the question-
wow, they're extremely big donors.

46
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:24,561
He's not responding to cefuroxime,
his pulse ox is dropping much faster
than it should for pneumonia,

47
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,622
and plus he's got
an odd little rash.

48
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,100
Excessive irritation.
He's 12. He's on auto-stroke.
On his arm.

49
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,764
Papular lesion, one centimeter,
on top of a long, thin scab.

50
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,073
Ah, you need a dermatologist.
If it's dry, keep it wet.
If it's wet, keep it dry.

51
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,342
If it's not supposed to be there, cut it off.
I never could master all that.

52
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,009
There you are.

53
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:48,417
Were you scared?
It's okay. You're home now.

54
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,422
Fine.

55
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,082
Cuddy.

56
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:59,961
- As a special favor to you-
- No. Admit it. I got you with the rash.

57
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:05,369
The rash is a total snooze,
unless it's connected to the pneumonia,

58
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,698
then it's party time.

59
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,506
Purulent sputum, dyspnea,
rhonchi bilaterally.

60
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,983
What kind of pneumonia
causes this kind of rash?
Legionnaire's disease.

61
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,489
Usually means industrial ventilation systems,
convention centers. He's 12 years old.

62
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,821
Send off a urine antigen and check
if he's joined the Elks. Next?

63
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,329
- Fungal.
- Excellent.
Maybe the lodge went spelunking.

64
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,490
- Chlamydia pneumonia.
- Twelve-year-olds don't have sex.

65
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,126
Their mistake.
[Sighs]

66
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,399
That's it?
Other possibilities?

67
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:44,910
- What if we're thinking about this backwards?
- The rash came first, caused the pneumonia. Nice.

68
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:49,641
Rickettsial. Tick bite.
Nymphal ticks are out now.
They're bloodthirsty little bastards.

69
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,413
- Rash would be more pustular.
- Not always,
and there's only one rash, which fits.

70
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:57,684
- New Jersey, it's most likely Lyme disease.
- All right. Let's keep him on fluids...

71
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,816
and the cefuroxime to be safe.

72
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,884
Biopsy that rash.

73
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,056
And take another history.
Even if we don't learn what's causing this,

74
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,930
we definitely need to know
if twelve-year-olds are getting any action.

75
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,667
- What are you doing now?
- We're collecting fluids from the rash.

76
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,973
Why?
They know what they're doing, Jeffrey.

77
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,482
Oh, great endorsement coming from
the woman who thought it was a nasty cold.
If I had had him last week-

78
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,676
This isn't helping.

79
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,382
We're checking to see
if your son has a tick bite.

80
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:34,688
Gabe, have you been camping recently,
playing sports outside, anything like that?

81
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,695
I'm not that good at sports.

82
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,789
- No hanging out anywhere new,
strange places?
- We've been through this.

83
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,131
- We don't let him run wild
through the neighborhood, right?
- [Gabe Coughs]

84
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,241
Okay. This might be a bit delicate.

85
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,202
- We need to know if you're sexually active.
- I beg your pardon?

86
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,805
- Mr. Reilich, we need to-
- No.

87
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,585
Nothing like that.

88
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,087
[Coughing]

89
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,353
[Coughing Continues]
We've gotta get another C.T. Scan,
check his lungs again.

90
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,417
- Third floor, right?
- Yeah, Radiology is-

91
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,258
Sorry, medical personnel only.

92
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,168
Where's the machine?
Well, we passed it, actually.

93
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:21,104
A little tension in the room back there.
Thought you could use a break.

94
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,371
Your dad's a pretty... high-powered guy.

95
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:30,007
Yeah. He was an air force test pilot.
Real Top Gun stuff.

96
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,016
Flew Mach 3.

97
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,075
Hard to deal with sometimes?

98
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,714
Guess I'm more like my mom.
Listen.

99
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,785
I promise to keep my mouth shut,
but I need to know.

100
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:47,026
You definitely haven't had
any sexual contact
of any kind?

101
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,033
I wish.
[Coughs]

102
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,092
You know what?

103
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,196
Girls like the cool guys now,
but give it a few years.

104
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,707
They start liking the smart guys.

105
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,074
- You'll be all right.
- [Coughs]

106
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,274
Can you keep a secret?

107
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,342
I have to. It's my job.

108
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,891
I'm cursed. I'm not kidding.

109
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,760
This seance thing the kids did?
It spelled out my name.

110
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,162
Said I was gonna die.

111
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,761
First name and last name?
We've got a Gabe upstairs
who's very old, very sick.

112
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,705
No. It's me.
I have the worst luck.

113
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,937
One time I broke this mirror,
[Wrapper Tearing]

114
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,479
The next week
my parents got separated.

115
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,448
My parents split up too.

116
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,250
Every kid feels like it's his fault.
It never is.

117
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:46,587
So, what about the rest of the stuff?
Any playing outside
your parents don't know about?

118
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,593
Anything like that?

119
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,358
Maybe you were somewhere
you weren't supposed to be?

120
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,491

Triage nurse, pick up line 274.

What's the secret- they're all morons?

He fell on something in the attic,
scraped his arm,
got the rash the next day.

- [House] Fungal pneumonia
without the cave. Clever.
- I'm gonna get a sample.

Dr. Chase,
you have a few moments?

00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,867
Sorry, I've gotta go.

128
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,805
These young doctors.
It's like they don't care about people.

129
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,642
- No manners.
- My fault, probably.

130
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:46,515
That's an interesting accent
you have there. I'd say Czech...

00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,689
You have quite an ear.

You're Chase's dad.

Twenty-six-year-old male,
sudden loss of the ability to speak-

00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:23,613
Just because you got out of clinic duty
doesn't mean everybody did.

See? You asked.

been dead for 10 of them.
You think Daddy murdered her?

00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,069
You want to get to the bottom of this,
you're doing it exactly right:

146
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,809
Don't talk to the people involved.
Drag your buddy away from work
for some pointless speculation.

147
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,443
You want to know how
two chemicals interact,
do you ask them?

148
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,148
No. They're gonna lie through
their lying little chemical teeth.

He fell on it-
some weird kind of insulation.

162
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,469
It's old.
House was built in the '60s.

163
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,534
What's it made of?
Felt, fibers of-what, cotton?

165
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,384
Sorry. Forgotten how funny your dad was.

166

- Not as funny as you.
- [Exhales]
High praise.

167

I know how protective
kids can be of their parents.

168
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,257
Not cotton. Animal hair.

169
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,594
Get me the C.T. Scan.

170
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,969
First, find the name of the company
that made the insulation,

171
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:05,415
and second, tell me what I'm seeing
that makes me want to short their stock.

172

Uh, enlarged hilar lymph nodes.

Peribronchial thickening.
- Pleural effusions.

174
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,049
Less obvious, more scary.

175
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,527
Well, the mediastinum
doesn't look right.

176
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,087
Slightly widened.
[Sighs]

177
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,657
Oh, God.

178
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,329
It can be transmitted
through infected animal hair.

179
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:30,068
But the Gram's stain would have shown-
No. The cefuroxime would have killed
some of it, clouded the result.

180
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,940
We've gotta get this kid on levaquin.

181
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,244
What does he have?

182
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,878
Anthrax. This house belong
to old man Hussein?

183
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,623

[Coughing Softly]

186
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,506
Anthrax. So, what-you think
there were terrorists in that attic?

187
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,807
It's a naturally occurring bacteria.

188
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,245
- We believe it was in the insulation.
- How sick is he?

189
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:14,981
Anthrax is very dangerous,
but we've caught it early. He's on levaquin.
It's the best antibiotic we have.

190
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,683
Lisa, you buy this?
Jeff, you've helped
our hospital a lot.

191
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,318
I wouldn't have assigned
Dr. House to your case
if I didn't have every confidence in him.

192
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,362
- Then who's this guy?
- Jeffrey!

193
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,389
There's all these weird diseases
that can cause a rash.
What about leishmaniasis or filariasis?

194
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,527
Where'd you hear about those?
Internet. I did some research.

195
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,233
Well, those are very rare conditions.
Oh, and anthrax
grows along the interstate?

196
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,775
Leishmaniasis doesn't cause
pneumonia, and filariasis-

197
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,368
Just look into everything.
This is my son, all right?

198
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,610
And I'm gonna stay on top of you
until I know he's safe.
I wouldn't expect anything else.

Breathe, baby. It's okay.
Breathe. I need you to breathe.

203
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,961
His breathing-
[Foreman]
It's on the inhale.

204
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,696
What does that mean?
It means his airway's closing up.

205
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,102
[Jeffrey]
Is the anthrax doin' it?

206
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:11,541
All right. Hold still, Gabe.

We've got you. It's okay.

- Nodules in his throat.
- Airway's occluded?

No, you're killing him!

- Airway's too tight.
Get me a smaller tube.

214
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,643
- We're traching.
- Smaller tube.

215
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,687
- His lips are cyanotic.
- He's not breathing.

216

No. I can do it. I'll get it.

[House]
Allergic reaction to the antibiotics?

225
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,795
I don't think so.
We switched him to rifampin,
and there was no change in the swelling.

226
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,702
We should try another antibiotic.
You really think he's allergic
to two antibiotics?

what Dr. Chase thinks.

Oh! I'm sorry. Not you.

229

Understandable mistake.
The other Dr. Chase.

and happens to be allergic
to two antibiotics.

231
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,227
Hate to step on anybody's toes,
but is it possible your guys
got this one wrong?

232
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,730
The rash is classic anthrax.
Except the color.

233
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,494
The rash hasn't turned black yet.
No necrosis, no anthrax.

234
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:19,059
Necrosis can theoretically take
as long as two weeks.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

236
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,678

It's a diagnosis.

Okay. Who thinks Junior wins?

238
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,085
Four to one.
It's not anthrax.

239
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,852
So we start over.
What's changed?
What do the nodules tell us?

240
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,890
- Sarcoidosis.
- Excellent. Send an ACE level.

241
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:49,525
If it comes back positive,
put him on methotrexate.

242
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,470
[Foreman]
We ran some tests and the results
point toward sarcoidosis.

243
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,236
It makes the body's
tissues swell up.

244
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,143
It seems to have gone after
Gabriel's skin and lungs
and given him this fever.

We don't know what causes it.

247
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:13,391
But you're sure he has this one?
We have a world-renowned
doctor consulting.

248
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,327
- He's convinced this is sarcoidosis.
- Is it treatable?

249
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:23,062
Very, actually.
See, this is I.V. Methotrexate.
It's an anti-inflammatory.

250
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,161
It should make all the swelling go down
and, uh, get you all better.

251
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,332
Stop.

252
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,301

Necrosis.

254
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:42,347
It's definitely anthrax,
and it definitely can't be anthrax.
It doesn't cause throat nodules.

255
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:47,290
Only explanation is,
this kid's got anthrax and sarcoidosis.

256
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,919
Right-
two incredibly rare diseases...

257
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,522

- Unless you've got a better theory.

Anthrax plus an allergic reaction.

259
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,261
Call the Lancet, because that's
one bizarre allergic reaction.

260
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,865
Come on. There's no reason
you both can't be wrong.

261
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,375
It's not allergy,
but it's not coincidence either.

262

Disease number one set off
disease number two.

263
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,615
- Anthrax weakened his immune system.
- [House] And triggered a dormant sarcoidosis.

264
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:16,711
Keep him on antibiotics for the anthrax,
and start the methotrexate
for the sarcoidosis. See what happens.

265
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,847
Fine.

266
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,892
Better go with him.
Make sure he doesn't snap
and hurt somebody.

267
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,895
Yeah, but y-you're treating him
for both diseases.

- Autoimmune.

- You think this is neurological?

307
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:37,613
The only reason you're thinking autoimmune
is because you're a rheumatologist.

- Autoimmune is a big universe.

It could be anything
from scleroderma to Churg-Strauss.

312
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,729
Whatever it is,
we should start him on steroids,

A hundred milligrams of cytoxan-
it treats most autoimmunes.

starts dripping out his eyeballs.

Your relationship with your dad is
messing with your ability to do your job.

319
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,790
Only because you made
my dad part of my job.
Good point.

On the other hand- getting better.

00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:44,103
Comes here expecting us to do
an extra-good job because he gives
a whole lot of money to this hospital.

471
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,345
- Don't talk to my son like that!
- Just telling him my job and my obligation-

472
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:51,184
Stop!
What's going on?

473
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,060
There's only one thing
you guys have gotta do.

474
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,964
Tell the truth, or your son will die.

475
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,729
How long were you in Asia?

476
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,038
Jeff, it's a simple question.

477
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,108
Two years, in India.

478
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:25,784
Why would you lie
about something like that?
It was '87 and '88.

479
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,829
This, uh-

480
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,562
This guru-
l-I thought he had some answers.

481
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,403
I went to his ashram...

482
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:48,275
and, um, ended up with no money
and no answers.

483
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,849
I was embarrassed.
I didn't want anyone to know.

484
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,186
No.

485
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,683
No. You were a test pilot.

486
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,522
I'm so sorry, Gabe.

487
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:08,027
What does this have to do with my son?

488
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:19,566
Clue number one: If I wereJesus,
curing this kid would be as easy
as turning water into wine.

489
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:23,341
Demonic possession?
Close, but no wafer.

490
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:29,353
Clue number two:
Rheumatology Rowan was almost right.
It causes autoimmune symptoms.

491
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,856
- Leprosy?
- Yeah, that's real big
in theJersey suburbs.

492
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:37,452
It's leprosy.
Run a Fite stain. It'll be positive.

493
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,895
Daddy hung out on
the wrong kind of Indian ashram.

494
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,991
But it's obviously dormant in the dad.
How could the kid catch it?

495
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,502
It's not dormant in the dad.
It's just slow.

496
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:50,132
Damaged his ulnar nerves.
Was misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel.

497
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,167
Never trust doctors.
Run a Fite stain.

498
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:58,306
No wonder he got anthrax.
The leprosy weakened his immune system.

499
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,909
Vicious circle: The leprosy
made him vulnerable
to the anthrax,

500
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,352
and the anthrax treatment
put the leprosy in overdrive.

501
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:10,122
- But the antibiotics we gave him-
they cure leprosy.
- Yeah. That's where the trouble starts.

502
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,890
The antibiotics hit the nerve strands.

503
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,661
They kill the leprosy bacteria,
and the corpses get tossed into the system.

504
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,999
And as fascinating as our bodies are,
they're also stupid.

505
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:24,167
They produce antibodies
to beat dead bacteria.

506
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,836
And these aren't the polite antibodies.

507
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,937
They're the ones that won't sit still,
kick during nap time.

508
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,380
They attack his neural and fat cells,

509
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,942
causing inflammation
and all the rest ofhis symptoms.

510
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,284
So the cure's killing him.

511
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:43,225
I want you to call down to Carville, Louisiana,
home of the last leper colony in the Lower 48.

512
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,421
Get 'em to send up
some thalidomide.

513
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:48,932
- Thalidomide?
- Twelve-year-olds don't have sex, right?
So he can't be pregnant.

514
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,991
Make the call.

515
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,100
I need to speak to your boy.

516
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,367
Hmm.

517
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,979
Why does everybody
need to know my business?

518
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,787
People like talking about people.

519
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,694
Makes us feel superior,
makes us feel in control,

520
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:24,428
and sometimes, for some people,
knowing some things makes them care.

521
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:29,667
I tell you my dad left,
my mum drank herself to death,
you gonna care about me more?

522
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,608
Cameron would.
Me, I just like knowing stuff.

523
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,644
[Sighs]
I know you hate your dad.

524
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,980
- Now, I'm gonna tell you something-
- I don't hate him.

525
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,289
I loved him until I figured out
that it hurts a lot less to just not care.

526
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,193
You don't expect him to turn up
to your football match,
no disappointments.

527
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:58,224
You don't expect a call on your birthday,
don't expect to see him for months,
no disappointments.

528
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:04,941
You want us to go make up-
sink a few beers together, nice family hug?

[Chuckles]

530
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,449
I've given him enough hugs.
He's given me enough disappointments.

531
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,187
Okay.

[Exhales]
Are you gonna have
to tell my friends I'm a leper?

538
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,402
You had the antibiotics.
You're not contagious anymore.

539

[Exhales]
Well, what if they already caught it?

540
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:15,671
Leprosy is incredibly hard to catch.
Even your mum didn't get it.

541
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,443
Right. I want you to make a fist.

542
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,542
It's still kinda stiff.

543
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,919

in a month or two.

You haven't asked about your dad.

He lied about everything.

547
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:40,235
He lied to my mom.
He lied to his boss.

548
