Why not?
Amber's a stripper name.

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,345
Find me one stripper
named Amber Hartig.

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,350
Or not. Okay.

Max Hartig.
It's a cute name, isn't it?

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,395
If you're a professional boxer,
maybe.

13
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,764
Can you believe we made
this little creature?

14
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:40,238
I know. It's incredible.
It's the most amazing thing
we've ever done.

15
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,607
I almost ran the marathon
last year.

16
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,770
If we're lucky, you won't inherit
your daddy's sense of humor.

19
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,846
She hasn't even eaten anything.
Why is she spitting up?

20
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,857
Well, honey,
we can't bug them again.
Could you-

21
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,325
Okay, okay.

22
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,963
I'm sorry. It's our first kid.
We're both a little panicky,
I guess.

23
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:10,730
Well, you gotta ask
the pediatrician next time.
I just deliver 'em.

24
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,967
- Is she spitting up?
- Yeah. Second time in an hour.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,032
Oh. If you lived underwater
for nine months,

26
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,601
you'd have a lot to spit up too.

27
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,908
Is something wrong?
A little lethargic.

28
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:29,785
- [Mr. Hartig] Well, we didn't think-
- She's hot.

30
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,917
The baby's seizing!
Get the crash cart!

31
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,656
- What's-What's wrong?
- Need some help in here.!

serious damage.

38

So, the Hartigs?

46
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,277
Their baby gets a fever.
What, don't tell me-
the kid had a seizure.

47
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,148
Yep. The parents, of course, start freaking,
and I have to deal with that for an hour.

48
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,017
Like it was your fault.
She was perfect
when I delivered her.

49

If you wanna blame someone,
blame the pediatrician.
So, how is the kid now?

50
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,624
Bowel obstruction.
She's under observation.
She'll be fine.

Exhibit A: Baby Girl Hartig.

53
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,134
Term baby, 42 hours old.

54
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,306
Went into seizures six hours ago,
brought into the intensive care...

55
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,282
diagnosed with obstruction
of the small bowel.

56
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,911
I'm still amazed you're actually
in the same room with a patient.

Another term baby, 48 hours old.

60
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,788
Brought into the NICU
three hours before the Hartig baby.

61
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,957
Fever of unknown origin,
101 degrees, trending upwards.

62
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,967
Wow, that is amazing.

63
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,970
You hung out in the OB/GYN lounge
all morning and heard about two sick babies.

64
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,269
- It's- It's eerie.
- Don't touch that.

65
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,334
All right.
We have an infection
spreading in the hospital.

66
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,903
[Scoffs]
These kids have totally
unrelated illnesses.

67
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,507
They fell sick within four hours
of each other.

68
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,611
They had the same delivery rooms,
maternity rooms are neighboring,
so transmission's possible.

69
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,521
- They have the same symptoms.
- The Hartig girl has a bowel obstruction.

70
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,685
No matter how close their beds are,
I'm pretty sure kids can't share a blockage.

71
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,252
What does bowel obstruction
on a chart indicate?

72
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,060
Normally I'd say it indicates
a patient's bowel is obstructed,

73
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,624
but I'm pretty sure you have
some deeper truth to impart.

74
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:34,298
It means that some random doctor
of indeterminate skill thinks that
the patient's bowel is obstructed.

75
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,468
- Okay, you're upset because
they threw you out of their lounge.
- Look at the X-ray.

76
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:41,377
It's a normal gas pattern.
If you want, I can get you a key
to the oncology lounge.

77
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,438
Air in the colon.
We're getting TiVo.

78
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,848
If it's air,
no bowel obstruction.

79
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,910
Even if it is air,
it could have been there
before the obstruction.

80
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,980
No. Something's infected
both these infants.

81
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,356
[Baby Crying]

82
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,918
And you're the only one
who put this together because-

83
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,328
Because I'm the only one
who looked at both kids.

84
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,061
I want them isolated.
I want the maternity ward shut down.

85
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,797
Because you're better
at reading an X-ray
than a radiologist.

86
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:09,103
Radiologists always overread
babies' X-rays, especially if they're
asked to rule out a pathology.

87
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,576
- He read into it what he wanted.
- Which is exactly what you're doing.

88
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,876
You're finding a cluster because you
think it's interesting to find a cluster.

89
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,247
Two plain old sick babies
would bore you.

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,083
See, this is why I don't
waste money on shrinks,

91
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,646
'cause you give me all these
really great insights for free.

92
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,353
Shrink. If you would
consider going to a shrink,
I would pay for it myself.

93
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,591
The hospital would hold
a bake sale, for God's sake.

94
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,064
We have an epidemic!

95
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:39,537
Two sick babies is very sad,
but it doesn't prove an epidemic.

96
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,779

97
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,242

That's it?

106
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,248
Yep. We've definitely
checked the whole floor.

No epidemic.

108
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,321

- How bad?
- Spiking fevers.

127
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,039
B.P.'s plummeting.
They're barely able to keep systolic up.

128
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,540
- At this rate, they could be dead in a day.
- Where did this come from?

129
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:00,477
Two delivery rooms, four different
maternity rooms. No common personnel
and no common equipment.

130
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,310
- There's got to be something in common.
- Yeah.

131
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,545
That would be the difference
between an epidemic and a coincidence.

132
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,713
I'm putting a team together.
We're gonna start swabbing.

133
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,725
What's she gonna swab?
Every respirator, sink, vent, drain
in the entire hospital?

134
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,488
- That'll take months.
- Needle in a haystack.

135
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,394
It's worse than that,
We don't even know
it's a needle we're looking for.

136
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:23,367
- Then why'd you let her go do it?
- Because the hospital is her baby,
and her baby's sick.

137
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,701
If she doesn't solve this soon,
her head's gonna explode, and I
don't want to get any on me.

138
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,706
So let's figure out
what's in the haystack.

139
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,901
- Differential diagnosis, people.
- Parasite.

140
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,502
- It's spreading too quickly.
- Next?

141
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,913
- Virus?
- The kids are too sick, and the blood tests
showed no lymphocytosis.

142
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,475
And they're not responding
to acyclovir or ribavirin.

143
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,851
If it's some other virus,
we'll never find it in time anyway.

144
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,858
Which leads us
to bacterial infection.

145
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:51,090
It's not responding
to broad-spectrum antibiotics,
so we've got something resistant.

146
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,189
- The usual suspects?
- MRSA. It's always MRSA in hospitals.

147
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,758
Maybe contaminated food
or water source.

148
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,701

"H" flu.

150
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,773
Okay. Those are the big ones.

00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,643
Cultures will take 48 hours.
Might as well be postmortem.

152
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,877
We'll start them on vancomycin
for the MRSA and aztreonam
to cover the rest.

But he's so tiny.

162
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,470
How sick is he?

163
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,632
His fever's up to 103.5,
and his blood pressure is 80 over 40.

164
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,142
How, um- How bad is that?

165
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,104
Uh-

166
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:53,015
It-It's low. The heart needs
to circulate the blood.

167
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:57,215
If it's weak, the oxygen isn't getting
to the liver, the kidneys, the brain.

168
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,725
Um, I have to ask you something.

169
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,488
Judy-
No, no, Kim. Let me.

170
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,893
Um, I had a cold last month,
and I told the doctors about it.

171
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,060
Honey, this has nothing
to do with you.

172
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,502
Kim's right.

173
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,165
Your son was born healthy.

174
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,505
He caught the infection
after his birth.

175
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,170
There's no reason to think
that he caught it from you.

176
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:24,580
But you don't know. I mean,
you don't know how he got sick.

177
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,489
Pretty standard question-
"How sick is my child?"
You couldn't answer.

178
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,290
I answered.
You rattled off numbers-
B.P., O2 sats.

179
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,697
It's not what they need to know.
What they need to know is the future.
You got a Magic 8 ball?

180
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,429
No, just eight years
of medical training.

181
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,303
Look, I realize it's tough
to break bad news to families.

182
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,470
Not as tough as hearing it.

183
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,778
And I guess being the poor guy dying
is the toughest of all?

184
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,341
No.

185
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,911
It's easier to die
than to watch someone die.

186
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,889
[Cuddy]
Well, we're checking the vents.
It could be airborne.

187
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,024
Somebody get the sinks, too,
and underneath them.

188
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,035
I'll get it.

189
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,095
How many med students
have you got swabbing the decks?

190
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,073
What else are they gonna do?
It's not like they're delivering babies.

191
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,702
You find anything yet?
Uh, yeah.

192
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:29,509
About half
the antibacterial gel dispensers
are empty or broken.

193
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,245
That's bad, yet diagnostically
completely insignificant.

194
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:38,256
Well, if the staff can't wash
their hands, it's no wonder
an infection has spread.

195
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,452
Hey! Tie clip!
Sorry?

196
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:46,123
We have an epidemic
in this hospital, and your tie
is becoming a petri dish.

197
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,656
Put on a tie clip
or take the damn thing off.

198
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,938
[Woman]
Myjoints have been feeling all loose,
and lately I've been feeling sick a lot.

199
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,942
Maybe I'm over-training.

200
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,673
I'm doing the marathon,
like, 10 miles a day, but I can't
seem to lose any weight.

201
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,443
Lift up your arms.

202
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,949
You have a parasite.

203
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:14,118
Like a tapeworm
or something?
Lie back and lift up your sweater.

204
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,185
You can put your arms down.

205
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,289
Can you do anything about it?
Only for about a month or so.

206
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,494
After that it becomes illegal to remove,
except in a couple states.

207
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,163
Illegal?
But don't worry.

208
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,139
Many women learn
to embrace this parasite.

209
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,372
They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes,
arrange playdates with other parasites.

210
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,812
- Playdates?
- It has your eyes.

211
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,219
But that's impossible.

212
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,620
Well, I assume you weren't
getting your period.

213
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,658
Maybe that should have
given you an inkling.

214
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,421
But I'm on this
birth control implant.
Yeah, I know.

215
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,296
I saw the scar on your arm.
And my doctor said I might not get
any periods at all if it was working.

216
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,665
Mm-hmm. Interestingly enough,
you also don't get any periods
if it isn't working,

217
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,569
which is why you were supposed
to get regular pregnancy tests.

218
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,733
Oh!
I'm gonna send a nurse in here
to schedule your prenatal care.

219
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,108
You're due in about five months,
so start planning the shower.

220
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,381
Um, Doctor?

221
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:15,978
Please, me and my husband
wanted to have a kid soon,

222
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,489
but, oh, God,

223
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:22,857
like four months ago,
we had this really big fight.

224
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:27,228
He moved out.
I did something stupid.

225
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,065
One-night stand?
Ex-boyfriend.

226
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,401
Well, I'll schedule you
a paternity test too.

227
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,771
I can't let my husband know.

228
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,276
Does the old boyfriend look
like your husband?

229
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,075
Yeah.

230
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,445
Then just have the kid.
He'll never know.

231
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,485
The most successful marriages
are based on lies.

232
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,283
You're off to a great start.

233
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,588
Well, you look cheery.
What's going on?

234
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,458
The Hartig and Chen-Lupino babies,
their kidneys are shutting down.

235
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,089
And the urine tests show no casts.

236
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,968
Which means the antibiotics
are causing the kidney failure.

237
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,563
You're the nephrologist.
Which one did it?
We'll take 'em off that one.

238
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,903
- Don't tell me
both vancomycin and aztreonam.
- They both can cause this.

239
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,970
There's no way to know
which one it is. No test.

240
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,381
We can't take 'em off
the antibiotics though.
They'll die of the infection.

241
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,942
If we leave them
on both the antibiotics,
they'll die of kidney failure.

242
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,253
So, we take our best guess then.
Which drug's causing the kidney failure?

243
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:30,955
It's like I said,
it's always MRSA in hospitals.
Take them off aztreonam.

244
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,431
I still think it's the pseudomonas.
I vote to take them
off the vancomycin.

245
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,498
There's no point in guessing.

246
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,470
Take one kid off vancomycin,
the other off aztreonam.

247
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,010
- They have the same disease.
You want to give them different treatments?
- What the hell are you doing?

248
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:58,318
- Therapeutic trial,
to find the cause of the infection.
- That's wrong.

249
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,518
We have four sick kids at least.

250
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,188
- Who knows how many more
haven't started showing symptoms yet?
- We have a duty to these two.

251
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,700
If these two have different reactions,
we'll know how to save the rest.

252
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:13,204
So you're condemning
one of these kids to die
based on random chance?

253
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,203
I guess I am.

254
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,519
[Babies Crying]

255
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,990
[Cuddy]
So you're going to flip a coin?

256
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,118
That's how you decide
which baby lives?

257
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,823
Can I borrow a quarter?

258
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,331
Do you want to get sued,
lose your license, House?

259
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,460
Well, generally I'd applaud that,
but my job is to protect this hospital,

260
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,664
so I strongly advise you to come up
with a medical rationale...

261
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,935
why baby '"A"should get medicine "X"
and vice versa.

262
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,446
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on there, slick.
We didn't all go to law school.

263
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:59,007
Your advice is that I should use
medical reasons to make medical decisions?
Hmm, that's not gonna be as easy.

264
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,609
Any medical justification.
It doesn't need to be a good one.

265
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:06,351
Well, "Hartig" sounds Jewish,
so does aztreonam, so we'll take
the Hartig kid off vancomycin.

266
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,552
How's that?

267
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,494
- You can't experiment on babies.
- Doctors experiment all the time.

268
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:15,294
- On adults, with their consent.
- Fine. I'll get the parents' consent.

269
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,201
Their informed consent.
They have to know the other kid
is getting a different treatment.

270
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:23,139
Sorry. Can't do that. It would be
unethical for one patient to know
about another patient's treatment.

271
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,338
- They have a right to know.
- If they know, they won't consent.
That defeats the whole purpose.

272
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,643
That's their right.

273
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,707
Two more babies
have just become symptomatic.

274
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,776
I defer to your legal wisdom.

275
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:39,552
Which takes precedence-
six dying babies
or a missing consent form?

276
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,219
You can't do it.

277
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,164
Do what you think is best.

278
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,028
Your daughter's kidneys
are shutting down.

279
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,430
Your son's kidneys are failing.

280
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,525
So we're going to
take her off the aztreonam.

281
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,433
We're taking him
off vancomycin.

282
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,598
Uh, but what-
what made her sick
in the first place?

283
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:32,542
- What do you think is causing it?
- It seems to be a germ called pseudomonas.

284
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,479
We think it's MRSA-
Methicillin-resistant staph aureus.

285
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,574
It's a very resistant form
of a very common bacteria.

286
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,119
We're hoping the aztreonam
will clear it up.

287
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:46,123
Vancomycin is the best treatment for MRSA,
so we're gonna keep giving it to her.

288
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,955
Is it gonna cure her?

289
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:56,329
Your child is very sick.
You need to know that.

290
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,064
This is a Hail Mary pass.
It might cure her. It might not.

291
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,938
So-So, that'll cure him?

292
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,783
We'll know in 24 hours
if it's working.

293
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,961
What did you tell them?
I told them the truth.

294
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,302
They seemed relieved.
Did you tell them how sick their son is?

295
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,775
I explained what was going on.
Allison, their baby's dying.

296
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,836
If the parents weren't in tears
by the time you left,
you didn't tell them the truth.

297
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,576
That's not how I see it.
Do you want them blindsided?

298
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,983
Want them coming up and saying,
"My God, my baby died.
Why didn't you warn me?"

299
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,715
So now it's about worrying
about them yelling at us?
No.

300
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,553
It's about getting them prepared
for the likely death of their child.

301
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,083
If their son dies tomorrow,
you think they'll give a damn
what I said to them today?

302
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:01,462
It's not gonna matter.
They're not gonna care. Nothing's
gonna be the same ever again.

303
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,832
Just give those poor women
a few hours of hope.

304
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,576
Dr. House!
Oh, no.

305
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,442
Dr. House,
this is my husband, Charlie.

306
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,482
Who told you
where my office was?

307
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,040
Jill, come on.
He obviously doesn't
want us bothering him.

308
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,450
Ooh, I was trying to hide it.

309
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:27,356
Look, Doctor,
this is about the mono
that you said you thought I had.

310
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,360
The mono?
Yes.

311
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,521
You know,
shouldn't Charlie be tested?

312
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,897
You know, the test.
The blood test.

313
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,596
Right.

314
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,037
Yeah, I'm sorry.
L- I sometimes forget patients.

315
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,201
I thought you were this idiot
who doesn't know how to use
birth control.

316
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:49,714
I can't have mono.
I don't even feel sick

for the common cold.

480
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,129
So, you mean there's no vaccine or-

481
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,064
There's a company in Pennsylvania
developing an antiviral.

482
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,124
It got positive results
in a lab setting.

483
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,932
We managed
to get our hands on it.

484
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:42,444
Imagine not being able
to touch your own baby.

485
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,284
Can I get your guys' help
with something?
Sure.

486
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,158
Your daughter, her-
Maxine.

487
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,631
That's her name- Maxine.

488
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,830
We need someone
to hold Maxine up off the bed
while the nurse changes her sheet.

489
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,839
Sure. Okay.

490
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,899
[Crying]
Shh, shh, shh.

491
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,605
Look at you. Hi.

492
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,670
Hold still.

493
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,112
[Crying Continues]
That's it.

494
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:25,593
Hi. Easy. Shh.

495
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,824
There you go.

[Elevator Bell Dings]

497
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,226
Hey, Foreman.

498
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,566
Got a minute?

499
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:16,970
So, pulmonary resistance
has stabilized for the two kids,
but, uh, B.P.'s still-

500
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,745
No news then.
How's Cameron?

501
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,582
Dr. Cameron?
Sure.

502
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,090
Let's start with her
and then move on to all
the other Camerons we know.

503
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,321
I'm sorry.
I'm just not used to you asking
about someone's well-being.

504
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,885
I can understand
how the question
would surprise you.

505
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,432
I don't quite get how it
would confuse you.
[Elevator Bell Dings]

506
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,628
Why do you wanna know?
Why do you wanna know
why I want to know?

507
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,228
Just curious.
Me too.

508
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,239
You don't get curious.

509
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,242
I'm the most curious man
in the world.
Not about trivialities.

510
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,438
Well, then
this must not be trivial.

511
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,348
How is Cameron
handling everything?

512
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,442
Just fine.

513
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,316
Great. Glad we talked.

514
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:09,698
Your husband is definitely
the source of your mono.

515
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,327
Oh. Wow!

516
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,667
Oh, thank God.

517
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,572
Wow. I'm gonna be a mom.

518
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,576
Whoa!
[Chuckling]

519
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:23,512
Thank you so much.
I gotta get you a gift
or something.

520
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,641
Sometimes the best gift
is the gift of never seeing you again.

521
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,878
Okay. All right.

522
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:32,650
But, Dr. House,
you've been so awesome.

523
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:37,092
I mean,
I really totally trust you.

524
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,391
Do you think you-
No.

525
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,431
Could do the prenatal-
No.

526
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,059
Or deliver the baby?
That would be "no."

527
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,831
Okay.

528
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,575
[Sighs]

529
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,576
Wow.

530
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,780
Chase, take a look at this.

531
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,562
Oh, God. It's good news.

532
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,503
No. It's great.

Hi. She's doing great.

Hi, little girl.

Hello.

00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,775
They all gone?
Hartigs are checking out
right now.

540
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,512
You look tired.
Thanks.

541
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:44,614
It's no wonder.
You've had a hard time
the last couple of days.

542
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,714
And you haven't?

543
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,782
Not like you.

544
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,991
Anyone who's that awkward...

545
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:58,229
either has no experience
with death or too much,

546
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,793
and I'm pretty sure
it's not the former.

547
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,940
Chase told me about that idea you had,
the parents holding the baby.

548
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,001
Where'd you get that?

549
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,042
Did you lose someone?

550
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,710
Did you lose a baby?

551
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,414
You can be a real bastard.

553
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,721
Unfinished business?

554
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,725
I'm in the haystack.

555
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,626
Ah, because now you know
you're looking for a needle.

556
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,629
Right.

557
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:37,633
If I tell you to let it go,
it won't make any difference, will it?

558

Enteroviruses
are spread by humans.

559
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,305
Fecal or oral usually.

560
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,967
It could be respiratory
secretions though.

00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,034
So Cuddy got stool samples
from the whole staff.
Just wait till they come back.

562
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,046
That won't do it.
Why not?

563
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:54,380
The shedder, whoever he is,
he's so virulent, he must have
been symptomatic.

564
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,579
Cuddy would have
noticed him.
Hmm.

565
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,283
And the babies didn't share
any common personnel.

- That's what's weird.
- Yeah, yeah. That's what's weird.

Yes, you do.

are comfortable.
