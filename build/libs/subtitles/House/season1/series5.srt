[House]
We are condemned to useless labor.

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,541
Fourth circle ofhell.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:13,409
Charting goes a lot faster
when you eliminate
all classic poetry.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,881
Writing down what we already know
to be read by nobody.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,783
I'm pretty sure Dante would agree
that qualifies as useless.

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,912
You're over two weeks behind
in your charting.

8
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,357
Oops. I missed.

9
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,418
- What are you, eight?
- Could an eight-year-old do this?

10
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,057
You'd better stop,
or it'll stick that way.

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,570
- You have a patient in Exam One.
- Yeah, but, see, I'm off at 12:00,
and it's already five of.

12
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:41,095
She's been waiting for you
since 11:00.

13
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:48,814
Melancholy without hope.
Which circle is that?

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,488
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

15
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,754
What seems to be the problem?
Show him your hands, Augustine.

16
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:11,499
- It-It looks like stigmata.
- Shh. Pius.

17
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,166
You must be all the talk
around the "holy water'"cooler.

18
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,404
Been washing a lot
of dishes recently?
I help out in the kitchen.

19
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,505
- Anything new in the kitchen?
- We just got a donation
of saucepans and pots this week.

20
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:27,451
- I unpacked and washed them.
- Should have spent your time saving souls.
It's easier on the hands.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,751
This is contact dermatitis.
You're allergic to dish soap.

22
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:35,420
Nonsense. We've always used that soap.
Why is there a problem now?

23
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:39,431
I've been a doctor for years.
Why do I have to keep assuring people
that I know what I'm doing?

24
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,933
Aperson can become allergic
to substances...

25
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,333
that they've had repeated
and prolonged exposure to.

26
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,897
The good news is- free samples.

27
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,938
Diphenhydramine.
It's an antihistamine.

28
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,776
It'll stop the allergic reaction.

29
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,376
Take one every eight hours.
It might make you feel a little sleepy.

30
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,013
And get some of that
over-the-counter cortisone cream.
Thank you, Doctor.

31
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,387
You want some water?
I have some tea.

32
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,155
Well, you just relax for a few minutes.
That stuff works pretty fast.

Still out by 12:00.

00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,237
How do you solve a problem
like dermatitis?
What?

35
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,835
Doctor? I want to thank you
for your patience.

36
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:30,576
She talkin' to you?
I don't know.
She's certainly looking at me.

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,051
Ah, it's good to get
a secular diagnosis.

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,181
The sisters tend to interpret
their illnesses as divine intervention.

39
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,022
And you don't?
Then you're wearing
an awfully funny hat.

40
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,654
Ooh, boy.
Excuse me.

41
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,359
If I break my leg, I believe
it happened for a reason.

42
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,424
I believe God wanted me
to break my leg.

43
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,733
I also believe he wants me
to put a cast on it.

44
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,739
Doctor.! Something's wrong.

Lift up your chin.

00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,547
Sister, you're having an asthma attack.
I need you to relax.

48
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,559
Roll up her sleeve, please.
I'm gonna give you epinephrine.

49
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,460

51
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,575
What happened?
Did she take the pill?

52
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,746
- Yes.
- It's probably an allergic reaction.

53
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,484
She's allergic
to an anti-allergy medicine?

54
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,549
You figure somebody's
out to get her?

55
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,561
- How are you feeling?
- [Quietly] Better.

56
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,723
I'll put you on some steroids instead.

57
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,666
- Is my heart supposed to be feeling so funny?
- It's called adrenaline.

[Nuns Murmuring]

65
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,209
[Cuddy] You diagnosed the patient
with allergies and prescribed antihistamine.

66
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,255
She went into respiratory distress,

67
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,121
and you injected her
with epinephrine.

68
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,285
Presumably 1 c.c.

69
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:32,195
.1 c.c. That is the standard dose.
That is what I gave her.

70
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,290
People don't go into cardiac arrest
from.1 c.c. Epinephrine.

71
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,632
She must have a preexisting heart condition
that got exacerbated by the epinephrine.

72
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,638
It's too bad you didn't
make a notation in the chart.

73
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,640
I can make it up right now.

74
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,575
The drawer has syringes with both dosages.
You could have reached for the wrong-

75
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,078
- But I didn't.
- Everyone makes mistakes.

76
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,205
This is why doctors pay through the nose
for malpractice insurance.

77
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,807
Relax. They're not gonna sue.

78
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,079
The worst they'd do
is whack my hand with a ruler.

79
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,554
- And the discipline board-
are they gonna whack your hand too?
- You're gonna report me?

80
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,320
- What choice do I have?
- Uh, how about not report me?

81
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,955
I can justify keeping her here
for a 24-hour observation.

82
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,662
If you haven't found an underlying cause
for the cardiac arrest by then,

83
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,671
I will have to notify our attorneys.

84
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,176
[Cameron]
Her hands were red and swollen.

85
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,580
Maybe she has a skin infection. Cellulitis?
That could manifest with tachycardia.

86
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,949
There's no history of fever.
Results from the C.B.C.
Didn't indicate an infection.

87
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,081
The eosinophils are mildly elevated.
Sed rate's up a bit. Could we be looking
at a systemic allergic response?

88
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,752
It's not allergic. Allergies don't cause
cardiac arrest like this.

89
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:39,264
- Could be inflammation of the blood vessels.
- Vasculitis? That wouldn't give you
an elevated eosinophil count.

90
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,129
Churg-Strauss vasculitis would.

91
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,862
The blood vessels of the heart,
lungs and skin become inflamed,

92
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,872
causing the asthma, rash and heart
problems- covers all her symptoms.

93
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,272
You need a biopsy to diagnose.
Chest C.T. Would be quicker.

94
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,278
The lady just came in
with a rash.

95
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,280
What the hell are those?

96
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,282
Candy canes.

97
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,047
Candy canes?
Are you mocking me?

98
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,988
No. It-It's Christmas, and l-

99
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:08,823
I thought-
Relax. It's a joke.

100
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,886
[Foreman] Isn't the prognosis
for Churg-Strauss a bit grim?

101
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:15,161
Yeah. Untreated, only 33% of patients
survive past a year.

102
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,726
Treated- five years.
Then I definitely suggest treatment.

103
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,171
If it was any other attending doctor,
I'd say that he made a mistake...

104
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,174
and gave her too much epinephrine.

105
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,040
Saying you wouldn't say
it was my mistake...

106
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,205
is saying it was my mistake.

107
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,716
Everyone screws up.
Your rule.

108
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,048
I think you fit within
the subset of"everyone."

109
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,088
I didn't screw up.

110
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:41,252
- Order a chest C.T. And start the sister
on prednisone- 40 milligrams T.I.D.
- The sister?

111
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:45,923
Oh, didn't I mention?
The patient's a nun- Sister Augustine.

112
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,523
[Moans]
I hate nuns.

113
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,337

~ [Upbeat]

115
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,548
- [Cameron] Sister Augustine?
- We weren't watching.

116
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,181
[TVTurns Off]
We were trying to see
if this is the bed control.

117
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,350
Oh. Uh, this one's
the bed control.

118
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,917
And that's the TV control.

119
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,294
I'm Dr. Cameron.
This is Dr. Chase and Dr. Foreman.

120
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,232
I haven't seen television
in over 20 years.

121
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,132
Do you consider it
the work of the devil,

122
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,398
or do you just not get cable
where you live?

123
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,069
- Um-
- How are you feeling, Sister?

124
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,542
I seem to be a little better.
They gave me some medication.

125
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,046
Prednisone. It's a steroid
to help with the inflammation.

126
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,548
Has Dr. House figured out what I have?

127
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,744
Will I be okay?
We're not sure what's wrong yet.

128
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,947
You'll have a chest C.T. Scan this afternoon
that'll help with the diagnosis.

129
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,185
Dr. House is giving her medication,
and he doesn't know
what she has yet?

130
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,660
Trust, Sister Pius.
It all happens for a reason.

131
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,754
[Foreman]
He doesn't know what he's doing.

132
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,800
The only problem that woman has
is that House grabbed
the wrong syringe.

133
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:59,065
You don't trust him?
I don't trust a man who won't admit
he might be wrong.

134
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,471
I notice you weren't so quick to tell her
she's got Churg-Strauss and only
has a couple years left.

135
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,510
I don't tell patients bad news
unless it's conclusive.

136
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,511
Because you know
he might be wrong.

137
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,911
About Churg-Strauss. Not about
what happened in the clinic.

138
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,417
[Scoffs]
What about you, Chase?
You think he's infallible too?

139
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:16,649
All I know is, if House didn't make a mistake
and Sister Augustine has Churg-Strauss,

140
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,623
he'll be self-satisfied
and our lives will be good
for a few weeks.

141
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,560
If House did make a mistake,
he'll be upset and our lives
will be miserable for months.

142
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,756
[Chuckles]
There is that.

143
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,891
If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake,
the least she could do
is suspend me from clinic duty.

144
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,801
She doesn't confuse making a mistake
with being incompetent.

145
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,339
Oh, here we go- lesson time.

146
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,272
I recognize that confidence
is not my short suit.

147
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,074
I also recognize that I am human
and capable of error.

148
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,139
So you might have
screwed this up?
No.

149
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,617
So it's merely a theoretical
capacity for error.
Good point.

150
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,281
Maybe there isn't one.
Maybe that's my error.

151
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,587
Most people who think
as much of themselves as you do
like to talk about themselves.

152
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,390
Most people don't like to listen.
So, what's wrong with you?

154
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,165
Let me guess- inflammatory bowel.

[Sighs]
Wow. Yeah. Is it that bad?
Yes.

156
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,448
It's also written on your chart.

00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,747
"Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain.

158
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,845
Took sulfasalazine,
but it didn't work."

- No. Then-Then l-

160
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,084
Oral corticosteroids-5-A.S.A.,
6-mercaptopurine. '"

161
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,356
- I'm impressed.
- By my medical history?

162
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,898
By how well
your last doctor charted.

163
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,332
It's one thing to have to go
to the bathroom every hour,

164
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,235
but when the kids
sit on my lap, it's-

165
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,398
The store sent me home.
They're gonna fire me.

166
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,443
Can't you put me back on 5-A.S.A.?
Maybe it'll work this time.
Not likely.

167
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,276
I'm giving you a prescription.
It's cheap, which is good,

168
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,281
because your insurance company
won't pay for it.

169
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,358
- "Cogaritis"?
- Cigarettes.

170
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,395
One twice a day.
No more, no less.

171
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,862
Studies have shown
that cigarette smoking...

172
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,593
is one of the most effective ways
to control inflammatory bowel.

173
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,035
Plus it's been well established
that you look 30% cooler.

174
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,562
- Are you kidding me?
- About the looking cooler, yeah.

175
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,405
- The rest is true.
- Isn't it addictive and dangerous?

176
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:22,208
Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe
are addictive and dangerous.

177
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,875
The only difference with this one
is it's completely legal.

178
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,987
Merry Christmas.

179
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,786
[Sister Augustine]
I was talking to the nurse-Arsenio.
Do you know him?

180
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:37,022
Not really.
He can take pictures
with his phone.

181
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,554
Cool.
That woman from the lab
was interesting too.

182
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,761
She studied astrophysics
before becoming a nurse.

183
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,795
You know the staff
better than I do.
I love to hear all about people.

184
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,001
- Yet you live in a monastery.
- It's where I serve our Lord
and the world best.

185
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,843
Our Lord maybe.
The rest of the world,
on the other hand,

186
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,680
- would probably get more
out of feeding the homeless or-
- Healing the sick?

187
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,710
As an example, yeah.
Did you always want
to be a doctor?

188
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,849
Always.
You always want to be a nun?
My parents died when I was six.

189
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,555
I was raised in a foster home
run by the Church.

190
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,656
When I was 18, I went to the monastery,
where they let me take my vows.

191
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,931
I've known no other life,
and I haven't wanted to.

192
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,530
[Foreman On Speaker]
Okay, Sister. We need you
to lie as still as possible.

193
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,598
If you get scared,
just let us know.

194
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,474
As Jonah said from inside the whale,

195
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:30,811
"When I had lost all hope,
I turned my thoughts to the Lord. '"

196
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,444
- Well, she's got God on her side.
- [Cameron] I don't believe in God.

197
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,853
You're not even a little agnostic?
[Sister Augustine On Speaker]
Is it supposed to smell funny?

198
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,825
Someone ralphed in there this morning.
We cleaned it up, but-

199
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:45,295
- It's normal, Sister.
It's just a few more minutes.
- Mm.

200
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,492
I believe in a higher order
that's in control of what happens,

201
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,365
but not one, anthropomorphic entity
called "God'"...

202
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,632
that's concerned with
the everyday workings of you and me.

203
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,470
What else is there to control
but the everyday workings of you and me?

204
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,510
It's always about you, Foreman.

205
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,374
What are you talking about-
the trees, the fish?

206
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,414
Should they be the ones that think
it's all about them?

207
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,540
What about you, Chase?
Do you believe in God?

208
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:11,054
I believe Sister Augustine
has no vascular pathology,
which means no Churg-Strauss.

209
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,523
Which means House made a mistake.
No, not necessarily.

210
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:17,392
It could be something else-
thyrotoxicosis or a carcinoid.
I don't get you.

211
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,194
You don't believe in God,
but you're willing to put
complete faith in one man?

212
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,600
[Sister Augustine]
Please. The smell.
Let's get her out of there.

213
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,106
[Gasping]
I'm coming, Sister.
I gotcha.

214
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,608
[Gasping]
Please. The smell.
I'm comin'.

215
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,906
I'm gonna be sick.
There's no smell.

216
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:38,245
No. God. Oh! It's Jesus.
It's Jesus!

217
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,751
[Crying]
He's coming for me!

218
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,288
He's burning me with his touch!

219
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,220
Let's get her on some Ativan.

220
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,125
The smells, religious visions-
it's symptomatic of temporal lobe swelling.

221
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,789
- We don't want her to-
- She's seizing.

222
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,560
- Jaw block!
- Help me get her on her side.

223
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,267
- Religious visions?
- Yeah. And next comes-

224
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,813
Patient tested positive
for herpetic encephalitis.

225
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,442
- What's that tell us?
- Her immune system
is severely compromised.

226
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,079
Oh, I know. Prednisone
compromises the immune system.

227
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:21,422
- Isn't that the medicine that you gave her
for that thing she doesn't have?
- Yeah, that- Hey.

228
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:25,657
- I'm thinking that's a trick question.
- Her immune system
is severely compromised.

229
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:30,634
- Two doses of prednisone wouldn't do that.
- Are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb?

230
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,731
- In 10 seconds, I'm going to announce that
I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.
- You're gonna admit negligence?

231
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,800
Unless you leave the room.
If you stay, you'll have to testify.

232
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,405
Five, four,

233
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,075
three, two-

234
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,118
So, there I was in the clinic, drunk.

235
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,245
[Laughs]
I opened the drawer,
closed my eyes,

236
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,482
take the first syringe I can find-

237
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,192
So, what are the options
for a compromised immune system?

238
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:01,393
Mixed connective tissue disease.
It'd explain why she was feeling better
on the prednisone.

239
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,493
Sure. She was feeling better
right up to the moment
it almost killed her.

240
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,266
On the other hand,
it explains the symptoms-

241
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,864
swollen hands, pulmonary problems,
cardiac problems.

242
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,842
It all fits.
Except her A.N.A. Was normal.

243
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,641
- So redraw the blood.
- But the treatment is corticosteroids-

244
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,943
prednisone- and we can't go there
because of the encephalitis.

245
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,975
Then we'll treat it with something
that modulates the immune system
but doesn't suppress it-

246
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,851
hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

247
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,690
There's no protocol for putting a patient
in a high-pressure oxygen room
to treat auto-immune problems.

248
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,127
Oh, you people.
Always with the protocols.

249
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,329
Prep the nun
and discontinue the prednisone.

250
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,001
I am both amused and annoyed...

251
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,568
that you think I should be
less stubborn than you are.

252
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,245
You are aware
of the Hippocratic oath, right?

253
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:56,584
The one that starts, "First, do no harm,"
then goes on to tell us no abortions,
no seductions,

254
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,351
and definitely no cutting
of those who labor beneath the stone?

255
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,359
Yeah. I took a read once.
Wasn't impressed.

256
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:05,488
Hyperbaric treatments could cause
oxygen toxicity- lung and eye damage.

257
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,055
Every treatment has its dangers.
Which is why we only treat...

258
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,761
if we're convinced the patient
actually needs the treatment.

259
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,498
I'm convinced.
You're not.

260
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,039
Question is, what are you
gonna do about it? Hmm?

261
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,172
I have an opening Thursday at 3:00.
Do you have a fourth?

262
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,845
Is he any good?
[Door Opens]

263
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,910
Can I call you right back? Okay.

264
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,814
What's up?

265
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,595
[Chase]
The pressure will force the oxygen
into your system, saturate your blood.

266
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,725
It will enhance white cell activity,
reduce the inflammation.

267
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,929
And that will help with this
mixed connective tissue disease?

268
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,168
We'll be doing about 10 treatments,
and then we'll reevaluate.

269
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,608
[Sister Augustine]
The last treatment with prednisone
caused the seizures, right?

270
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,546
How confident is Dr. House about this?

271
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,379
[Cameron]
That you reacted so strongly
to the prednisone let us know...

272
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,544
that you had an underlying problem
with your immune system.

273
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,078
I guess it was a blessing... of sorts.

274
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,157
[Man On TV] So, who's your favorite
reindeer, Nurse Arnold?

275
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,165
Rudolph.
I would've thought
it was Vixen.

276
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,600
What are you implying?
Nothing.

277
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,297
But I saw you at the Christmas party
with Dr. Riles...

278
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,806
and Dr. Jorkins
and Nurse Crandall.

279
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,900
[Nurse]
I was just doing
some Christmas dancing.

280
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:29,471
- This is a chapel, a house of prayer.
- [TVContinues, Indistinct]

281
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,675
House of prayer? Huh.

282
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,684
That explains the good reception.

283
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,812
Also why nobody's ever here.

284
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,017
I need to talk with you, Dr. House.

285
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,221
Sister Augustine believes in things
that aren't real.

286
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,795
I thought that was a job requirement
for you people.

287
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:52,360
She's been known to lie
to get sympathy.

288
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,702
She's a hypochondriac.

289
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,732
So you're warning me that I may
be treating a nonexistent ailment.

290
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,302
Sore throats, joint pains.

291
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,247
There's always something wrong,
and there's never a reason for it.

292
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,341
Mother Superior plays right into it-

293
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,114
lets Augustine off work duties,

294
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,952
treating her as fragile, special.

295
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,822
That must make you angry.

296
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,884
It bothers me.

297
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,430
It's not really
in Augustine's best interests.

298
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,469
You want some?

299
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,530
I shouldn't.

300
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,373
I guess you gotta
be good at reading people
to be a good infirmarian, huh?

301
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,475
Mm. Mm-hmm.

302
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,180
So, we've got pride, anger, envy,
gluttony-

303
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,753
That's four out of seven deadly sins
in under two minutes.

304
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,818
Do you people keep records of these things?
Is there a "Cathlympics"?

305
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,990
They say you have a gift.
They like to talk.

306
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:59,595
- You hide behind your intelligence.
- Yeah. That's pretty stupid.

307
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,663
And you make jokes because you're
afraid to take anything seriously.

308
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,005
Because if you take things seriously,
they matter.

309
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,171
And if they matter-
When things go wrong,
I get hurt.

310
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,341
- I'm not tough. I'm vulnerable.
- I barely know you.

311
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,613
And I don't know if I'm right.
I just hope I am.

312
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,086
Because the alternative is...

313
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,624
you really are as miserable
as you seem to be.

314
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,656
You know, from the way
you're looking at me right now,

315
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,699
I'd say you just hit number five.

316
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,400
Lust.

317
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,580
[TVTurns On]
Dr. Brown, I love you too.

318
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,754
[Air Hissing]

319
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,053
[Vacuum Releases]

320
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,426
How are you feeling?
A little weak.

321
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,159
- That's from the oxygen.
- My mouth is dry.

322
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,600
Okay. Well, uh, I'll get you
some of your tea.

323
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:10,605
Mixed connective tissue disease?
Her A.N.A. Is barely elevated.

324
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,406
Thanks for checking up on her.
Good to know you got my back.

325
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:17,141
O2 sat's down to 83.
Pulmonary problems,
breathing problems.

326
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,241
Irritation from the oxygen
is typical.

327
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,219
She comes in with a rash,
and you put her into cardiac arrest.

328
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,448
[Sighs]
That well just never
runs dry, does it?

329
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,015
If there was no underlying problem,
why is she still having
the rapid heart rate?

330
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,721
Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis
caused by you giving her prednisone.

331
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,991
Her reaction is a symptom,
not an error.

332
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,226
There's always an explanation,
isn't there?
Yes, there is.

333
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,235
And if this one doesn't work,
we'll find another.
But never one involving you screwing up.

334
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,294
One that fits all the facts.

335
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,671
Look, we obviously have
a difference of opinion,
and that's fine.

336
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,337
But, unfortunately, I've used up
all the time I budgeted today
for banging my head against a wall.

337
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,848
I'm gonna do you the biggest favor
one doctor can do for another.

338
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,714
I am gonna stop you
from killing your patient.

339
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,185
You're off the case.

340
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,668
We're gonna treat the symptoms.
Not the underlying condition?

341
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,267
There is no underlying condition.
What's her status?

342
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,403
The sister's breathing
is labored.

343
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,880
Pneumonitis
from the hyperbaric chamber.

344
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,316
Put her on 40% oxygen
until her O2 sats increase.
B.U.N. And creatinine's rising.

345
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,946
A.L.T. And A.S.T. Twice the normal range.

346
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,617
Could be from the hypotensive episode.
Let's follow them with labs.

347
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:37,355
She still has the rash and joint pain
she came in with.

348
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,956
Order a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory.
When we were looking at the differential
diagnosis with Dr. House,

349
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,934
we were considering-
I don't need to hear
what Dr. House was considering.

350
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,438
All of this woman's symptoms can be
traced to Dr. House's considerations.

351
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,042
Okay.

352
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,601
Let's just get this patient healthy.

353
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,410
I want her going out the front door
and not the back.

354
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,352
Hey, it's not like
I betrayed him.

355
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,888
Cuddy would have found out about
the hyperbaric treatments eventually.

356
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,116
You did what you
thought you had to.
[Sighs]

357
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,508
Can't get enough
of this place, huh?

358
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,245
Came for my stethoscope.

359
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,339
So I shouldn't read too much
into the fact that you
were looking for it...

360
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,407
in the drawer
with the epinephrine syringes in it?

361
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,580
Okay. Yeah, I'd like to clear
my reputation.

362
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:42,218
Oh, right. I forgot how much
you care about what people think.

363
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,127
Prescribing cigarettes
for inflammatory bowel?

364
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,290
That's, uh-They cause
lung cancer, you know.

365
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,130
You know why they have ribbons
for breast cancer,

366
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,968
colorectal cancer, prostate cancer-
and not for lung cancer?

367
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,007
They ran out of colors?

368
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,634
It's because people
blame lung cancer patients.

369
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,644
They smoke. They screwed up.
They deserve to die.

370
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,806
The reason people die
from lung cancer is guilt.

371
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,715
Huh. Well, guilt
does a lot of damage.

372
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,053
You said that
with great significance.

373
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,957
You're not here to find your stethoscope.
You're not here to clear your reputation.

374
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:19,190
You're here because you're having doubts.
You might have screwed up.

375
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,858
I'm here because, if I'm right,
Cuddy is killing that patient.

376
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,299
Okay. But if you're wrong?

377
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,706
Then she's saving her.
Fine.

378
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,174
You're gonna have to go through
every record of every patient...

379
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,734
who's been through this clinic
in the last two days.

380
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,975
And you're gonna have to hope
that those records can be trusted.

381
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,243
Which, by the way, yours can't.

382
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,089
These pills will help your kidneys
function a little better, Sister.

383
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,039
Get your wrist?

384
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,242
What's that?

385
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,677
104.

386
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,739
Is that good?
It's fine.

387
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,954
You're a lousy liar, Dr. Chase.

I have to get this.
Excuse me.

[Door Opens]

390
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,530
My mother's been dead
for 10 years.

391
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,638
But she's always with you in spirit.

392
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,798
What do you know about the nun?
Which one?

393
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,310
The cute one.
I think she likes me.

394
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:43,108
- The sick one, obviously.
- Her parents died when she was a child.

395
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,775
She's been with the Church
ever since.
What's she lying about?

396
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,319
- Why do you say that?
- I always say that.

397
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,082
And the old nun thinks the sick nun
is a big fat nun liar.

398
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,920
You know nuns.
What do you think?
I don't know nuns.

399
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,984
You hate nuns. You can't hate someone
if you don't know them.

400
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,622
Know any Nazis?
Maybe I hate them on principle.

401
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,895
I have a theory about
what makes good boys good.

402
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,302
It's not because
of some moral imperative.

403
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,704
Good boys have the fear of God
put into them.

404
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,834
Catholic Church specializes
in that kind of training-

405
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,903
to make good boys
afraid of divine retribution,

406
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,108
so they'll do
what their daddies tell them-

407
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,085
like, for example, going into medical school
when it's the last thing they wanna do.

408
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,087
What do you think?

409
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,287
I think, if she did have a secret,
her boss would know.

410
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,797
[Bells Tolling]

411
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,357
Did you paint or put in
new carpets recently?
No.

412
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,630
Any way she could have
got access to drugs?

413
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,765
We lock all our medications in the infirmary,
and we don't keep prescription drugs here.

414
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:48,108
Why haven't you asked Sister Augustine
about these things directly?

415
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,114
I've found that when you want
to know the truth about someone,

416
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,946
that someone is probably
the last person you should ask.

417
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,647
Ah. And have you been speaking
to Sister Eucharist?

418
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,350
She ratted out her fellow sister
pretty quickly.
Oh.

419
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,655
If I were you, I'd have her repeat
a year of nun school.

420
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:06,060
[Laughing]
Well, becoming a nun
doesn't make you a saint.

421
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,565
Becoming a doctor
doesn't make you a healer.

422
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,467
And just because we live in a monastery,
and we spend most of our time in prayer,

423
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,404
doesn't mean we don't
find time for drama.

424
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,338
So, what is the sick one's drama?

425
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:22,142
Sister Augustine lived in Catholic
foster care until she came to us.

427
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,911
- Tea?
- Sure.

428
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,716
Do all of you lie?

429
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,316
It's a good strategy, ; it's simpler
when you all tell the same lie.

430
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,362
She has not spent her entire life
as a good Catholic.

431
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,366
When she had a cardiac arrest,
I had to open her blouse to do C.P.R.

432
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,426
And I learned two things:
Nuns can have nice breasts,

433
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:49,997
and she has a tattoo on her shoulder-
of a skunk.

434
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:54,171
Now, maybe
it's the sacred skunk ofJoseph,

435
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:57,510
but, as far as I know,
Catholic foster care and monasteries...

436
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,380
do not keep tattoo parlors
in their refectories.

437
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,148
We consider that our life begins...

438
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,746
when we put on our habits
and take our vows.

439
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,418
- What happens before then-
- Is irrelevant to you,
but it's relevant to me.

440
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,866
Sister Augustine went into foster care
when she was six years old,

441
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,531
but she left when she was 12.

442
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,473
She lived on the streets.
She got into drugs.

443
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,937
When she was 15,
she became pregnant.

444
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,947
Tried to self-abort.

445
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,950
She lost the child.
She became ill.

446
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,952
We took her in
when she came back.

447
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,548
If we had thought
it was medically relevant,
we would have told you.

448
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,651
It's not.

449
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,570
This tea is delicious.
Local herbs?

450
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,839
Any change
with the medication?
Yes. She's getting worse.

451
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:03,210
Lung function's deteriorating.
B.U.N. And creatinine
continuing to rise.

452
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,772
She's starting to run a fever,
and the rash is spreading.

453
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,080
At this rate, she's not
gonna make Christmas.
Maybe House is right.

454
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,485
Maybe there is an underlying condition
that explains the symptoms.

455
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,149
Something we haven't considered.
Like what?

456
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,351
It could be a metabolic disorder.
Specifically?

457
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,361
Might be genetic.
Specifically?

458
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,761
I'm just saying-
You're just saying
you think House is right.

459
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,356
Might be right.
Of course he might be right.

460
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,267
It might be the hand of God at work.
Don't say it's something else...

461
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,634
unless you've got
something concrete to offer.

462
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,136
What's this, hemlock?

463
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,509
I'm gonna do you the biggest favor

I'm gonna stop you
from killing your patient.

465
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,876
It's figwort tea-
great for that little pick-me-up
we're all looking for in the morning.

466
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:46,549
Opens the lungs,
increases the blood pressure,
stimulates the heart.

467
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:50,526
Unfortunately, if you then get injected
with even.1 c.c. Of epinephrine-

468
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,155
instant cardiac arrest.

469
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,496
- Still, what the hell, it tastes great.
- Sister Augustine-

470
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,059
Has been drinking it religiously,
so to speak.

471
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,129
And if you take the cardiac arrest
out of the equation-

472
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:06,405
All the rest of the symptoms
can be explained by a severe
long-term allergic reaction.

473
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,639
Well, that's what Cameron
said in the beginning.

474
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:12,308
Yes, she did. Well done.

475
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:17,582
But your unwillingness
to stick by your diagnosis
almost killed this woman.

476
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:20,215
Take a lesson from Foreman-
stand up for what you believe.

477
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,924
Okay. Let's go figure out
how to save a nun.

478
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,022
Damned if you do,
damned if you don't.

479
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,435
[House]
Because it's been untreated for so long,

480
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,028
it's gone from a simple " watery eyes,
scratchy throat" allergy...

481
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,437
to a whopping
"I'm gonna kick your ass" allergy-

482
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:40,501
compromising her immune system,
diminishing her ability to heal
and breaking down her organ systems.

483
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:44,014
So, what's the source?
[Chase]
The dish soap.

484
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,108
No. The symptoms persisted days
after the dish-washing episode.

485
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,382
It's gotta be something she's been
exposed to here in the hospital
as well as the monastery.

486
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,616
[Foreman]
What about the tea?
It caused her arrhythmia.

487
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,624
Could be, but it's not definitive.

488
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,490
[Chase] We'll skin-test for allergens.
[Cameron]
Not yet. She's too reactive.

489
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,496
She tests positive to everything.
We need to stabilize her-

490
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,658
isolate her from all possible allergens-
give her system a rest.

491
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,668
[Chase]
Get her in a clean room.
[House] Okay.

492
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,863
Then gradually introduce allergens
and see how she responds.

493
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,805
When she reacts to something,
we'll know that's what's killing her.

494
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,211
There you go.
No television, no books.

495
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,543
- Not even my Bible?
- I'm afraid not.

496
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,980
This room has filtered air,
filtered water.

497
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,918
You even have silk sheets-
very decadent and hypoallergenic.

498
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,455
You should be feeling better here.

499
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,889
[Monitor Beeping]

500
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,122
We'll be back to check on you
in a little while.

501
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:35,394
Can the other sisters
come in and pray with me?

502
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,432
It'd be better if you
don't have any visitors.

503
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,098
Once we isolate
what's causing your allergy,

504
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,107
then we can be a little more lax.

505
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,478
[Whimpers]

506
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,037
[Crying]

507
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,753
[Whimpering]
L-I can pray with you.

508
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,552
I don't wanna die.

509
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,786
[Crying]
Why has he left me?

510
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,795
I was in seminary school.

511
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,139
They asked us once
what our favorite passage was.

512
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,373
I chose First Peter,
chapter one, verse seven.

513
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:28,450
"These trials only test your faith
to see whether or not
it is strong and pure.

514
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:33,821
Your faith is being tested,
as fire tests gold and purifies it."

515
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,293
"And your faith is far more precious
to the Lord than mere gold.

516
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,694
"So if your faith remains strong
after being tested,

517
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:44,394
"it will bring you much praise
and glory and honor...

518
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,804
on the day of his return."

519
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,999
He hasn't left you.

520
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,976
[Laughing, Crying]

521
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,071
The only thing in the way of you
knowing he's there is your fear.

522
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:02,848
You have a choice- faith or fear.
That's the test.

523
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,082
Choosing faith
doesn't mean I won't die.

524
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,317
But it will affect
how you experience your death...

525
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,986
and, therefore, your life.

526
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,824
It's up to you.

527
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,888
Why did you leave seminary school?

528
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,228
That test.

529
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,898
You passed. I didn't.

530
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,539
We'll call you if anything changes.
Will she be all right?

531
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,547
As long as she's not exposed
to anything that can aggravate
her allergy, she'll be fine.

532
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,942
- I need some help in here!
- [Sister Augustine Gasping]

533
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:41,583
Screw the procedure!
She's in anaphylactic shock!

534
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,889
No way. She's in a damn clean room.
You kidding me?

535
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,896
Get in here!

536
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:50,594
[Chase]. 1 c.c. Of epi.
[Foreman]
We've got to intubate.

537
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,102
[Cameron]
I got it. Get the ambu bag.

538
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,317
[Sister Augustine Gasps]
I'm in.

539
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,455
[Oxygen Pulsing]

540
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,390
[Monitor Beeping]

541
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,955
Breathing's stabilized.

542
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,802
It's a clean room.

543
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,179
[House]
How do you get an allergic reaction
in a clean room?

544
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:42,143
Maybe it was the preservatives
in the I.V.?
Checked that.

545
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,780
Latex tubing?
Checked that.
Checked everything.

546
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:49,555
Well, it could be mast cell leukemia.
It can cause anaphylaxis.

547
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:55,122
I checked the blood levels,
and it's not eosinophilia
or idiopathic anaphylaxis.

548
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,327
Maybe it's just divine will.

549
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,894
It's not my will.

550
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:09,876
You do realize, if you're wrong-
about the big picture, that is-

551
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,881
you're going to burn, right?

552
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,110
What do you want me to do-
just accept it, pack it in?

553
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:17,643
Yeah. I want you to accept
that sometimes patients die
against all reason,

554
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,656
and sometimes they get better
against all reason.

555
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,215
No, they don't.
We just don't know the reason.

556
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,989
I think the nuns
would agree with you on that.

557
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,227
[Tapping]

558
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:37,141
I just wanted to say that I know
that you did everything you could.

559
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,541
I don't need verification from you
to know that I'm doing my job well.

560
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,512
That's your problem, not mine.
I was just being nice.

561
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,345
Yeah, well, you don't need
to always do that.

562
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,685
Merry Christmas.

563
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:03,665
Sister Augustine's been extubated.

564
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,201
Good.
She's requested to check out,
against medical advice.

565
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,207
She wants to go back
to the monastery.

566
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,539
Well, talk her out of it.

567
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,910
I think I may have
talked her into it.

568
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,248
[Sighs]

569
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:36,096
Room's paid up
for the rest of the week.

570
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,536
Might as well stick around.

571
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:43,870
This illness...
is a test of my faith.

572
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:48,139
If it's his will to take me,
it doesn't matter where I am.

573
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,942
I can accept that.

574
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,415
Does anybody believe
anything you say?

575
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,253
You're not accepting.

576
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,657
You're running away.

577
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,886
Just like you always do.

578
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,793
You ran away from the monastery
to get laid.

579
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,864
You ran away from the real world
when getting laid didn't
work out so good.

580
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,735
Now things aren't working out again,
so off you go.

581
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:18,741
Why is it so difficult for you
to believe in God?

582
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:23,143
What I have difficulty with
is the whole concept of belief.

583
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,682
Faith isn't based on logic
and experience.

584
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,186
I experience God
on a daily basis...

585
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:33,087
and the miracle of life all around-

586
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:37,025
the miracle of birth,
the miracle of love.

587
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,824
He is always with me.

588
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:44,129
Where is the miracle in delivering
a crack-addicted baby?

589
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,534
Hmm?

590
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:50,040
Then watching her mother abandon her
'cause she needs another score.

591
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,234
Miracle oflove.

592
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,108
You're over twice as likely
to be killed...

593
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,148
by the person you love
than by a stranger.

594
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,413
Are you trying to talk me
out of my faith?

595
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:05,319
You can have all the faith you want
in spirits and the afterlife...

596
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,187
and heaven and hell.

597
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,989
But when it comes to this world,
don't be an idiot.

598
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,599
'Cause you can tell me
that you put your faith in God
to get you through the day,

599
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,692
but when it comes time
to cross the road,
I know you look both ways.

600
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:23,536
I don't believe he is inside me
and is going to save me.

601
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:28,341
I believe he is inside me
whether I live or die.

602
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,403
Then you might as well live.

603
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,750
You got a better shot
betting on me than on him.

604
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,317
When I was 15,

605
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,884
I was on every kind of birth control
known to man-
[Gasps]

606
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,294
And I still got pregnant.

607
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:52,268
I blamed God. I hated him
for ruining my life.

608
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,270
But then I realized something.

609
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:59,970
You can't be angry with God
and not believe in him
at the same time.

610
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:03,775
No one can.
Not even you, Dr. House.

611
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,912
How'd it go?
She has God inside her.

612
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,187
It would have been easier
to deal with a tumor.

613
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,490
Maybe she's allergic to God?

614
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,436
We've looked everywhere
for an allergen that could
be causing this reaction...

615
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,597
except one place- inside her.

616
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,040
On her medical history, she didn't
mention any surgery.
She had one.

617
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:35,545
Can we get her records?
What hospital was it at?
She didn't have it at a hospital.

618
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,707
Order a full body scan.
What if she refuses?

619
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:42,310
Tell her I'm looking
for a miracle.

620
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,423
[Foreman]
No piercings. No fillings.

621
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,153
No surgical pins in the arm.
No implants.

622
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:53,025
It's clean as a whistle.
What's House looking for?

623
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:58,261
- What is that?
- Don't know.

624
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,930
Lock on it.
Get a 3-D representation.

625
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,132
[Typing]

626
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,943
Oh, my God.

627
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:16,444
The copper cross- a form of birth control
pulled off the market in the '80s.

628
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,217
- So she's allergic to copper.
- Rare, but it happens.

629
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,122
Wouldn't she know
she had an I.U.D.?

630
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,684
She had an abortion.
I.U.D. Must have been left in,

631
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,856
embedded in the endometrial tissue
where it couldn't be detected.

632
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:31,060
So, all we have to do
is remove the I.U.D.

633
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,433
Then the symptoms
should subside.

634
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:38,203
I got this I.U.D. When I was 15.
It-It's been more than 20 years.

635
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,369
Prolonged exposure to an allergen
with minimal symptoms.

636
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:45,939
But at some point.
All it takes is one last contact
to cause a full-blown reaction.

637
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:49,349
Just like a balloon filled with air-
one last breath, it explodes.

638
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,721
The first time I got the rash
was when I was washing
the copper cookware.

639
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:58,751
And all your subsequent symptoms
came from ingesting food prepared in it.

640
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,320
Dr. House found his miracle.

641
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,333
I doubt he'll interpret it that way.

642
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,562
[Laughs]

643
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,661
You told me your favorite passage.

644
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,729
Would you like to hear mine?

645
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,035
"Celebrate and be glad,

646
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,046
because your brother was dead
and is alive again."

647
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:20,083
The prodigal son.

648
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,450
He'll be waiting for you
when you're ready.

649
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,519
We'll schedule your surgery
for tomorrow.

650
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,499
The sixth circle of hell.

651
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:40,298
Confined in a sweat box
with a bloody nose,
and all the tissues are soggy.

652
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,635
I think that's the seventh.
No. The seventh is-

653
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:46,642
God, you must be fun at parties.
I think we both know
the flaw in that theory.

654
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,202
How's the sister?
Heart rate is normal,
kidneys functioning.

655
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,614
You know how it is with nuns.
You take out their I.U.D.'s,
they just bounce right back.

656
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,050
Great.
Told you I didn't screw up.

657
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:00,885
You screwed up.
I gave her.1 c.c. Of epinephrine.

658
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,552
Yeah, and if Cuddy hadn't taken you
off the case, you would have killed her.

659
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,999
You wanna come over
for Christmas dinner?

660
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:12,502
You'reJewish.
Yeah. Hanukkah dinner.

661
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,334
What do you care?
It's food. It's people.
No, thanks.

662
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:21,945
Maybe I'll come to your place.
Your wife doesn't mind
being alone at Christmas?

663
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,776
I'm a doctor.
She's used to being alone.

664
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,276
I don't wanna talk about it.
Neither do I.

665
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,315
You did good with the nun.

666
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:40,125
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

667
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:44,327
Merry Christmas, Dr. House.
Dr. Wilson.

668
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,604
Good night.

669
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,798
That was sweet.
