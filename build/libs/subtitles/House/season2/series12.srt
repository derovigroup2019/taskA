1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,838
Whoo!

2
00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:08,174
All right, hold on.
I got to turn up here.

3
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,471
Whoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,646
How cool was that?

5
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:21,691
That was way cool.

6
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:23,025
Oh.

7
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:27,196
My turn.

8
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:28,531
No, sorry, that's not allowed.

9
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:31,867
I just signed 15 pages of forms,
saying you gotta ride
on the back of that thing.

10
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,536
I don't see any lawyers around.

11
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:34,870
You know that's not the point.

12
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:38,082
No, you just wanna keep
all the fun to yourself.

13
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:41,295
Come on, Dad.

14
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:45,006
You go over 15,
we're pulling over.
All right, I mean it.

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,801
- You're the best.
- All right, get on there.

16
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:48,594
Put on your goggles.

17
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:51,180
Ready?

18
00:00:51,724 --> 00:00:53,725
Got the clutch in?
All right, that's my boy.

19
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:56,854
Whoo! Hoo-hoo!

20
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:59,607
Whoo!

21
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:03,278
Whoo!

22
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:10,452
Adam, you're going too fast.
Slow it down.

23
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:17,044
I mean it.
You're going too fast.
Slow down!

24
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:18,379
Adam!

25
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:25,343
Adam!

26
00:01:26,677 --> 00:01:28,555
Let go of the throttle!

27
00:01:32,894 --> 00:01:36,773
Adam! Adam! Adam!

28
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:43,157
2x12 - Distractions

29
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:08,645
Original Airdate (FOX):  14 February-2006

30
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:11,606
What do you got?

31
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:15,609
16-year-old, status post, ATV crash,
40% of burns on his body.

32
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:18,736
Nasotracheal intubation.
Start a bag of lactated Ringer's,
wide open.

33
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:19,570
Is he gonna be okay?

34
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:21,865
We'll be with you when we can.
Get him out!

35
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,160
Wait, wait, wait.

36
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,662
I'll start fluids.

37
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:27,538
Let's go get him moved up.

38
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,851
De-re-maki.

39
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:47,396
De-re-maki.

40
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:50,775
Been looking for you.

41
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:52,694
Been avoiding you.

42
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,986
Burn unit can handle it.

43
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:56,991
If they could handle it,
they wouldn't be asking for you.

44
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,328
Is that a journal?

45
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:01,580
A friend wrote an article.

46
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:02,747
In Hindi?

47
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:05,958
They have a cutting edge
neuroscience program in India.

48
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,419
Says so right on the cover.

49
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:14,634
This kid's heart rate's messed.

50
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:17,055
Tachycardia can be
explained by the burn.

51
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,305
I assume the burn unit knew that.

52
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:23,311
His potassium's low.

53
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:25,397
Which can also be
explained by the burn.

54
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:28,150
Except I'm sure the burn unit's
pumping him with fluids,

55
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,653
which means his potassium
should be going up, not down.

56
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,238
Could be amphetamines.

57
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,282
Or bacteria lunching on his heart.

58
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:37,745
Or cardiomyopathy, or
some other very bad thing.

59
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,455
He needs an EKG.

60
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:42,917
Eww.

61
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,674
Okay, no skin, no EKG.

62
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,677
Is he even going to survive the burn?

63
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:54,097
You got a date or something?

64
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:56,974
40% of his body.

65
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,393
If the burns unit can
prevent an infection,

66
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:03,481
his body will regenerate maybe 10%.
Surgeon's will do 20 or so grafts.

67
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:06,818
Six months in this room,
he'll end up with a series of nasty scars.

68
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:09,780
Maybe some pain,  but he'll live.

69
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:15,578
Unless his heart shuts down, because
we can't figure out what's causing
the low potassium and tachycardia.

70
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,418
We need help from a Belgian Doc,
named Einthoven.

71
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:21,711
He's dead.

72
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:25,799
While he was alive,
he invented a little ditty
called the Galvanometer.

73
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:26,925
Where do we get one?

74
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:30,638
Go to any electronics store
that's been open since before 1905.

75
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:33,600
There's a good chance they got one
in the corner in the basement.

76
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:38,480
We need an audio/visual  setup for the lecture hall.

77
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:40,358
- What for?
- For the lecture.

78
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:43,112
- What lecture?
- Dr. Weber's lecture.

79
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:47,074
- Who's Dr. Weber?
- Uh, neurologist, I think.

80
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:48,991
The memo was from you.

81
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:57,835
- Where's my assistant?
- She left.

82
00:04:57,918 --> 00:04:59,045
- When?
- Wednesday.

83
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:02,590
- Seriously?
- The temp agency sent someone,
but she got lost.

84
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:05,677
Well, when she gets here,
fire her.

85
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,701
Oh, yeah.

86
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:29,287
Did you issue this memo?

87
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,705
Look at that.

88
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,542
Congratulations.

89
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,380
The patient that has been
in a coma for two years and
counting is still in a coma.

90
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:39,132
This is not my signature.

91
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:42,343
I don't know
anything about this guy.
I'm supposed to introduce him?

92
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:43,719
Have lunch?

93
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,387
[Monitor bleeping]

94
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,474
The coma patient
has a migraine?

95
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:48,516
Oh, no, no, no.

96
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,894
No, I gave him medication
to prevent a migraine.

97
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:54,731
That's a migraine.
Increased flow velocity
in his cerebral arteries.

98
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,444
I did, subsequently,
give him nitroglycerin,
which could possibly--

99
00:05:57,527 --> 00:06:01,824
You induced
a migraine headache
in a coma patient?

100
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:03,409
I  gave him
a little headache.

101
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:05,453
Similar to the one
you're giving me now.

102
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:08,165
Have you even read
an ethical guideline?

103
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:13,547
Well, it'd be wrong to try out
a new migraine prevention medication
on someone who can actually feel pain.

104
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:14,797
Did you sign this?

105
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:16,842
Uh...yeah.

106
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:21,096
We can talk later about
the appropriate discipline.

107
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:28,438
Because of the burn, we can't
perform any of our normal tests
to see what's wrong.

108
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:30,775
So we're going to
try a Galvanometer.

109
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:34,860
It picks up a pulse
in the wrists and the ankles.

110
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,239
Hopefully  it will tell us
why his heart rhythm is abnormal.

111
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:40,116
What have I done to him. I--

112
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:41,743
It was an accident.

113
00:06:42,662 --> 00:06:44,122
All right, so...

114
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:48,752
he's got all these burns.
And now there's something
wrong with his heart?

115
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:51,463
We're trying to figure out
if the two are somehow connected.

116
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,632
Had he been sick lately?

117
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:54,759
No, nothing.

118
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:57,553
Anything unusual
with his behavior?
Had he been tired a lot?

119
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,640
- Nothing.
- He was great. He was happy.

120
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:02,225
He was just having
a great time and then--

121
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:06,105
If he was experimenting
with amphetamines or cocaine--

122
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,065
No.

123
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,653
We gave him some pot
about a year ago to try.

124
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:11,778
It was just once.

125
00:07:12,237 --> 00:07:16,201
We thought if we took the mystery
out of drugs and alcohol,
the less he'd experiment.

126
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:18,161
We'll know more after the tests.

127
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:23,168
It looks like they're gonna
electrocute him.

128
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,669
Plug it in.

129
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:29,131
You plug it in.

130
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:31,634
Fine. Gimme the cord.

131
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:39,809
Works.

132
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:43,689
Prominent U-waves.

133
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:45,150
No inverted T-wave.

134
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:46,734
No ischemia.

135
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:48,444
Q-wave normal.

136
00:07:49,362 --> 00:07:50,822
That's not good.

137
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:55,954
Chase, turn it off.

138
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:57,038
Turn it off!

139
00:07:57,122 --> 00:07:58,872
- What's happening?
- What is that?

140
00:07:59,374 --> 00:08:01,001
He's seizing, get in here.

141
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:08,426
Who electrocuted my patient?

142
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,304
- He had a seizure.
- He wasn't electrocuted.

143
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:11,805
What does the seizure tell us?

144
00:08:12,097 --> 00:08:13,264
Move.

145
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,433
What are you looking for?

146
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:18,269
Same as you.
Love, acceptance.
Solid return on investments.

147
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:19,895
Differential  diagnosis.
Go.

148
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,940
Could be epilepsy,
or seizure disorder.

149
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,524
Not with the tachycardia.

150
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:25,444
It could be a virus in his brain.

151
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,322
Specificity's impressive.

152
00:08:27,864 --> 00:08:29,449
Adrenoleukodystrophy.

153
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:33,453
Could be M.S.,
seizures could be caused
by plaques and lesions on the brain.

154
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:36,040
Well, let's find out which.
Get him an MRI.

155
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:37,750
No nuclear imaging.

156
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:41,380
He wouldn't survive
the move to Radiology.

157
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:43,591
MRI and CT scan are both out.

158
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:48,680
Okay. Lumbar puncture'll tell us
if his proteins are elevated.
At least we can exclude M.S.

159
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:50,724
Can't do a lumbar puncture either.

160
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:54,519
You're cramping my exits.

161
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:56,564
Don't tell me,
no skin on his spine.

162
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:59,443
We'd be inserting
a needle into an area
that's teeming with bacteria.

163
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:02,197
If he doesn't have
a brain infection already,
we'd give him one for sure.

164
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:04,448
There's no other way
to look at a brain.

165
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:08,410
Transcranial Doppler Sonography.

166
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:12,581
She said brain,
not pregnant woman's uterus.
They do sound alike.

167
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:14,251
I used one to look at
a brain this morning.

168
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,961
Why didn't you take the patient
to Radiology, get an MRA?

169
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:19,299
Obviously, I was
doing something illegal,

170
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:21,633
and using nuclear imaging
would've raised questions.

171
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:24,512
You're not gonna get
a diagnosis of M.S. from a sonogram.

172
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:29,601
Not definitively, but patients with M.S.
have more reactive neurons
in their occipital cortex.

173
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:35,024
Okay, then?

174
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:43,284
Thank you for all
coming to today's lecture
by Dr. Phillip Weber,

175
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:50,250
who is our guest today
at our hospital to talk
about headaches.

176
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,504
Dr. Weber is
at the Weber Center for Pain.
That makes sense.

177
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,092
Weber-Weber, um.
So please welcome, Dr. Weber.

178
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:08,853
Thank you, Doctor...Cuddy.

179
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:14,609
I suppose I should tell you
a little bit more about myself.

180
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:17,697
I went to school in Virginia,

181
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:21,618
You've never to one of
these things in your life.
Who is this guy?

182
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:23,411
No idea.

183
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:25,998
What's with the outfit?

184
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,794
Sudden chills,
and light sensitivity.

185
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,463
Inexplicable.

186
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:35,719
I received my medical degree
at Johns Hopkins University,

187
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,888
where I studied under
Brightman and Gilmar.

188
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,226
Hmm...he must be good.
You went to Hopkins

189
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,978
and studied under
Brightman and Gilmar.

190
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:45,647
Shh...

191
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,067
...helped me win
the Doyle internship
at the Mayo clinic.

192
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,985
You were supposed to
get the Doyle internship.

193
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,615
This guy's Von Lieberman?

194
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,325
The guy got you
thrown out for cheating?

195
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,244
The Dean threw me out.

196
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:02,206
Von Lieberman just ratted on me.

197
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:04,290
This guy's name is Weber,
not Von Lieberman.

198
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:06,293
I call Weber Von Lieberman.

199
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,795
Way eviler. Shh...

200
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:14,469
...and five HT Sub 1D receptors
have improved the acute
treatment of migraines.

201
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,472
To this point...

202
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,308
So what's the plan?

203
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:21,311
You wanna wait 'til he bends over
and make a fart sound?

204
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:24,439
I'm not here about the past.

205
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:26,651
He's a bad scientist.

206
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:30,571
Well, you cheated off him,
how bad can he be?

207
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:33,659
He got the answer wrong.

208
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:43,168
Doug:
Are they trying to wake him up?

209
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,338
They can't do that, right?
He'll be in too much pain.

210
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,464
Don't worry, he's still under.

211
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:50,927
But the brain never completely
sleeps, it's always working.

212
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:54,889
Controlling your heart rate.
Breathing. Temperature.

213
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,851
Cameron:
The eyes respond
to visual stimuli.

214
00:11:57,935 --> 00:12:01,982
Blood flow increases
in certain areas of the brain and
we can track that with a sonogram.

215
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:07,113
With M.S., blood vessels are
more reactive, so flow is faster.

216
00:12:07,196 --> 00:12:09,407
If Adam has an infection,

217
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,868
there'd be swelling which
would constrict the arteries,

218
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:13,871
and the flow would be slower.

219
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,749
Chase, near the subarachnoid space.

220
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:21,712
[Monitor bleeping]

221
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:30,889
Data from control subjects were analyzed
with a two-way ANOVA with status
and side as within-subject factors.

222
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,102
You stalked this guy for 20 years
just for the shot to humiliate him?

223
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:37,854
Shh. I'm trying to learn.

224
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:40,149
...vessels without significant rebound.

225
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:42,318
He doesn't even know
what that means.

226
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:44,488
You're going to
interrupt him, aren't you?

227
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:46,031
If I have a question.

228
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,907
And what's that
going to accomplish?

229
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:50,286
Why can't you just enjoy this?

230
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:52,037
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

231
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:56,418
You have got to find
less debilitating outlets
than humiliating people.

232
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:00,256
I hear bowling is
more fun than stalking.

233
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:01,883
But I'm better at this.

234
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:04,636
If P is less than point zero...

235
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,306
Blow a ton of money
on a plasma TV.

236
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:10,811
We found a subarachnoid bleed.

237
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:14,606
Bleed in the head
isn't causing seizures.

238
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,985
It could be. 10% with damage
to the cerebral cortex have seizures.

239
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:19,654
Or bacterial meningitis.

240
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:20,780
Viral encephalitis?

241
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:21,907
There's no way
to tell without--

242
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:23,366
Shut up!

243
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:25,868
Excuse me?

244
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:28,162
Not you.

245
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:31,833
If my lecture is interrupting
your meeting, I can wait.

246
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:33,836
[Says something in Hindi]

247
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:38,132
As your people say in India.
Appreciate it.

248
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:41,846
We'll figure out why later.
Um, fix the bleed, or he dies.

249
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,471
Talk to you
in a couple of hours.

250
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:48,435
De-re-maki.

251
00:13:58,156 --> 00:14:00,157
I'm in the subarachnoid space.

252
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:02,577
Can you get it?

253
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:03,910
I  think so.

254
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:08,208
Put  the probe back where
it was so I can see the wire.

255
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:10,044
- We're looking for the bleed--
- Look when I get there!

256
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:12,879
I'm flying blind
without a contrast CT here.

257
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:27,396
And with a p value of less than .001,

258
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:34,154
we have strong statistical evidence that
this drug prevents migraine headaches
without daily administration.

259
00:14:34,196 --> 00:14:36,448
Uh, excuse me, Doctor.

260
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,241
He knows this field
better than you do.

261
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:40,493
It's always been
my understanding that, uh,

262
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:44,458
unless you follow a daily regimen,
no drug can prevent a migraine.

263
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,252
That's why they call it
a breakthrough.

264
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,295
That's why YOU call it
a breakthrough.

265
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:54,303
No, the, uh, pharmaceutical company
sponsoring my clinical trials
also hails it as a breakthrough.

266
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:57,139
I'm sure your wife
and lawyer do too.

267
00:14:58,391 --> 00:15:02,103
Is there anybody who doesn't
stand to make a fortune from it,
calling it a breakthrough?

268
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:03,063
Who are you?

269
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:05,983
Just a lunatic who
desperately needs a hobby.

270
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,943
How exactly do
these studies work?

271
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:09,902
Do you give this drug
to a bunch of people and

272
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:13,321
they don't get a migraine,
you go, voila, my drug works?

273
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:15,408
Uh, excuse me, Miss?

274
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:17,619
Uh, do you have cancer?

275
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:22,291
Wow. Mango juice
prevents cancer.

276
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,504
Perhaps I should've
taken my medication
before this lecture.

277
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,839
[Roars with laughter]

278
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:30,342
Dr. Weber:
We had a very
specific control group.

279
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:32,302
Chronic migraine sufferers.

280
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:34,264
I don't have time to go through
all the math right now,

281
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:38,268
- but the incidence was dramatically--
- Sure, in India.

282
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,189
Two plus two
equals five there, right?

283
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,441
Do I know you?

284
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:45,653
I know your math skills.

285
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,320
They blow.

286
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:48,780
Touch?.

287
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,784
You sound very familiar.

288
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,703
Why did you publish it
in an obscure journal in India?

289
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:58,417
Why not publish in Really Really
Cool Head Cases of South Philly?

290
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:01,044
Neuroscience New Delhi
is a respected journal.

291
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,797
Yeah, the guy running
Slurp 'N' Gulp tells me
it's one of the best.

292
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,592
Get a hooker.
Anything.

293
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,301
See, I'm thinking that

294
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:13,265
publishing studies is
probably the easiest way
to get a pharmaceutical company
to give you a reach-around.

295
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:17,604
And choosing a journal that
no one can actually read,
well, that's, that's shrewd.

296
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:19,314
I know I know you.

297
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:20,691
Sure you do.

298
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Dick.

299
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:23,152
The name's Philip.

300
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:24,612
Oh, my bad.

301
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:26,281
Something to do
with your face.

302
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:28,284
I always think
your name is Dick.

303
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:29,910
House?

304
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:31,245
Here.

305
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:34,623
Medical school was 20 years ago.

306
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,418
Give it a rest, grow up.

307
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:39,921
Yeah, you were
always the grown-up,
do the responsible thing.

308
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:41,507
Tattletale.

309
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:44,718
- You cheated.
- I cheated then,
you're cheating now.

310
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:45,929
Your drug doesn't work.

311
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:49,265
Oh, yes, you would like to believe that,
because it plays right into your fantasy--

312
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:51,351
- I tested it.
- Oh, really?

313
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,936
What are your parameters?
Where's your study?

314
00:16:57,272 --> 00:16:58,942
Room 2134.

315
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,068
One patient?

316
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:01,778
The coma patient?

317
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,489
You haven't changed a bit.

318
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:09,455
You took short cuts in med school,
you're taking short cuts now.

319
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:12,875
You cannot test this
on an abnormal brain.

320
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,880
That's so closed-minded.
He's not abnormal, he's special.

321
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:20,843
Cerebral cortex atrophies
in coma patients.

322
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:25,348
You need live,
conscious people.

323
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,520
You don't know
everything, House.

324
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,738
It's something that
disrupts brain function.

325
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:41,575
Plaques are perfect.
Interrupt neuronal communication.

326
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:42,869
- M.S.?
- No.

327
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:47,497
M.S. is complicated.
I think this is more basic.
It's just tachycardia and seizures.

328
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:50,835
How much longer
the burn unit guys gonna
keep him in that thing?

329
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:53,714
Lecture's over. Let's go.
House wants to...

330
00:17:56,883 --> 00:17:58,385
Adam's waking up.

331
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:00,846
Get the anesthesiologist
in here now.

332
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:02,390
Cameron:
He's in pain.

333
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,434
That's not pain.

334
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:08,146
Need some help in here.

335
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:12,067
[Gasps for air]

336
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12,053
Adam had an orgasm.

337
00:19:13,804 --> 00:19:14,806
What?

338
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:16,557
You mean while he was--

339
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,896
Oh!

340
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:21,814
God!

341
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:24,358
What's wrong?

342
00:19:26,194 --> 00:19:28,236
I'm having a migraine.

343
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:29,904
Are you okay?

344
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:32,825
Uh, yes.

345
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:36,411
I was right.

346
00:19:37,998 --> 00:19:39,414
O h!

347
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,885
We'll knock you out
for a couple of hours.

348
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:50,762
No, I got work to do.

349
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:56,644
Just gimme sumatriptan
for the pain and verapamil
so it doesn't recur.

350
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:03,695
I heard the patient had fun
in the hyperbaric chamber.

351
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:04,779
Yeah.

352
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:07,157
Gotta schedule me
some time in there.

353
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,747
Weber's meds aren't
even legal in the U.S.

354
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:14,916
It's legal in India.

355
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,460
I was disoriented.

356
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:26,385
Um, moving around
is a bad idea.

357
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:29,223
Hey, if you feel chest pain,
you need to let me know.

358
00:20:29,307 --> 00:20:31,933
Verapamil can cause
congestive heart failure.

359
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:35,020
Nothing can hurt my heart.

360
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:40,193
Foreman:
Hey, you're gonna
feel some dizziness.

361
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:42,404
Definitely gonna be constipated.

362
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:50,873
Differential diagnosis
for getting off.

363
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:52,123
Is he gonna be okay?

364
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:54,585
No, something's seriously
wrong with him.

365
00:20:54,668 --> 00:21:00,091
Differential diagnosis
for ejaculation.

366
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,053
Don't make me say it again.

367
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,348
We're not stalling,
we just don't know.

368
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,932
Then guess.

369
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,725
Could pain medication
cause an orgasm?

370
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:10,518
I wish.

371
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:12,311
Maybe pain
caused the orgasm.

372
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,233
You get a tattoo,
the brain releases endorphins
which create pleasure.

373
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,694
Most people don't orgasm
from a needle prick.

374
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,322
Well, Chase has a point.

375
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:24,451
The brain is like
a huge train station.
If the switches--

376
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,704
Ow.

377
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:29,457
You're the neurologist,
talk for me.

378
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:33,586
If sensory information
got misinterpreted by
the medial forebrain bundle,

379
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,633
it's possible
for bad to feel good
and good to feel bad.

380
00:21:36,716 --> 00:21:40,386
He's a lucky kid.
Let's not fix him
until the burns heal.

381
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:42,389
So what attacks
the medial forebrain bundle?

382
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:44,808
Infective neuropathies.
Vasculitic neuropathies.

383
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:47,187
Krabbe's disease,
metachromatic leukodystrophy.

384
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,814
House:
All very bad things.

385
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:52,652
No way to look for
any of them in his condition.

386
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:53,985
Could be an infection.

387
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:55,822
I said infection
about eight seconds ago.

388
00:21:55,905 --> 00:21:57,448
You listed some
brain infections.

389
00:21:57,908 --> 00:22:02,370
But what if it's just
a regular old infection
festering in the burned skin?

390
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:05,081
Pus on his arm isn't causing
problems in the forebrain.

391
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:10,378
He's on 20 different medications
to manage his pain, his heart,
how often he urinates.

392
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,258
His brain is like a waiter
that's got too many--

393
00:22:13,341 --> 00:22:14,176
Hey, hey.

394
00:22:14,592 --> 00:22:16,135
I do the metaphors.

395
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:19,597
The brain is stressed.

396
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,599
An infection elsewhere
could put it over the edge.

397
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:24,644
So we just wait for his burns
to heal to see if you're right?

398
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:27,524
If you're wrong, he doesn't
have that kind of time.

399
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:31,820
Dominic Larrey.

400
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:33,780
He another dead doctor?

401
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:37,076
He was Napoleon's Surgeon in Chief.

402
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:38,704
Cleaned a lot of battle wounds.

403
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:39,997
By amputating legs.

404
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:42,247
And with bugs.

405
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:49,465
Cameron:
Maggots are implanted
directly into Adam's burns.

406
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:53,676
Maggots--eat dead people. I--

407
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,597
Maggots eat dead flesh.
Only dead flesh.

408
00:22:57,764 --> 00:23:00,226
So they're perfectly suited to clean wounds.

409
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,233
They also kill the bacteria
that thrive in injured tissues.

410
00:23:34,892 --> 00:23:36,061
Ho!

411
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:45,652
Dr. Jekyll, I presume, they found
a half-eaten sheep in the zoo.

412
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:47,362
The police want to
ask you a few questions.

413
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:49,030
I need something to wash it down.

414
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:53,077
Coffee? Bad idea.
You're better off with water!

415
00:23:53,244 --> 00:23:54,871
Coffee's closer.

416
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:58,500
Foolproof plan, by the way.

417
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,294
Either his meds would work,

418
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,259
and you'd be in psychic pain,
because Von Evil is gonna be rich.

419
00:24:06,218 --> 00:24:10,264
Or they wouldn't, and
you get to be in agony all day.

420
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:13,977
Perfect lose/lose situation.
Very you.

421
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,353
I had to prove--

422
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:16,939
You proved nothing.

423
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,276
Right.

424
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:22,613
This isn't a migraine.

425
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,953
Yeah, Dear New England Journal of Medicine,
I took this guy's drug,
and still got a headache.

426
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:31,582
Thus scientifically proving that my arch enemy is an idiot.

427
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:32,958
You just wanted the pain.

428
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:36,252
The meds are supposed
to prevent migraine.

429
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:40,799
You get distracted by pain.
Leaves less room for the things
you don't wanna think about.

430
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:44,594
Like the Flyers sucking,
or the price of gas, or,

431
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:47,807
oh, the fact that you pushed
the love of your life out of your life.

432
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:50,809
God, I wish
the pain would go away.

433
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:53,813
Next time you need to
get your mind off her,
stick a needle in your eye.

434
00:24:53,897 --> 00:24:56,359
It's less annoying to the rest of us
when you can still walk.

435
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,495
Did you sleep here?

436
00:25:10,332 --> 00:25:11,958
Lower.

437
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:14,254
Do you want a pillow?

438
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:17,256
Not softer, lower.

439
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:19,969
The frequency of your voice is grating.

440
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,762
You should've been better by now.

441
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:23,306
I'm super.

442
00:25:23,806 --> 00:25:25,016
The patient?

443
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,393
The maggots did great for the burn.

444
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:30,395
But the brainwaves are
still all over the map.

445
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:34,734
Which means your regular old infection
isn't causing his brain dysfunction.

446
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:39,073
Which means there's an underlying condition.
Which means we gotta get inside his head.

447
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:41,116
Do a lumbar puncture.

448
00:25:41,324 --> 00:25:43,494
We've already established
that we can't get a lumbar--

449
00:25:43,578 --> 00:25:45,622
C2, C3.

450
00:25:45,914 --> 00:25:48,459
No, no, no way.

451
00:25:48,626 --> 00:25:51,753
I only saw a cervical tap once,
and that guy got paralyzed.

452
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:56,885
Ask the parents
if they prefer to have their son
in a wheelchair, or dead.

453
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:03,560
Something's causing
his brain to lose control.

454
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:05,730
Eventually it will shut off.

455
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:10,319
We need to do a lumbar puncture
to get some of the fluid in his spine
so we can test it.

456
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,320
You need us to sign a consent?

457
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,073
I have to warn you.

458
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:17,910
There's a serious risk of
paralysis or death.

459
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,203
Are you saying
we shouldn't do this?

460
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,038
You have to do this.

461
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,082
Then why are you telling us
what can go wrong?

462
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,250
I just think you should know.

463
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:29,047
Either you're cruel or this clipboard
is a way for you to cover your ass
in case you cripple our son.

464
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,509
- This isn't his fault--
- No, it's not, it's yours.

465
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,092
That's what you
keep telling me.

466
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:37,389
My son is lying in there
half dead. I am just trying to
find a way to get through this.

467
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,894
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I know.

468
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:01,249
Needle.

469
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:19,144
- It's not going in.
- Don't force it.

470
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:21,021
I'm going one space higher.

471
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:23,733
It's too close to his brain stem,
it'll herniate.

472
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:26,611
- You're gonna paralyze him.
- Not helping.

473
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:27,821
[Monitars start beeping]

474
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:29,656
His blood pressure's spiking.
Stop.

475
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:30,407
I can get it.

476
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,244
He's 180 over 120.
He's gonna stroke.

477
00:27:34,828 --> 00:27:37,082
I'm in the space.
Gimme the vial.

478
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:50,179
[Monitars stops beeping
and go back to normal]

479
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,273
He doesn't have M.S.
or an infection.

480
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:01,361
His proteins aren't elevated?

481
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,529
Wrong protein.
IgM, not IgG.

482
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:06,989
Elevation was probably
caused by the bleeding.

483
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:13,080
What if there was tingling
in his extremities prior
to the crash?

484
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:15,084
How can you still be on M.S.?

485
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,751
You gotta be on something.

486
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:21,423
Something's interrupting
his neurons' chit-chat.
Like lesions.

487
00:28:21,548 --> 00:28:23,176
We can't scan for them.

488
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:26,345
Only test we can do we just did,
and it was negative.

489
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:28,640
He has no tingling,
no numbness.

490
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:31,227
You read his history.
Parents didn't say anything about--

491
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,895
What about Adam?

492
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:37,484
We can't look into his brain,
but you want us to read his mind?

493
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:40,488
Good point.

494
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,501
Yeah, you can finish
the sponge bath in a minute.

495
00:28:52,585 --> 00:28:54,419
They're just redoing his dressings.

496
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:56,005
He's out, he's fine.

497
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:59,591
I didn't page you to put him out,
I paged you to wake him up.

498
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:02,136
Why are these lights
so damn bright?

499
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,264
Thank you.

500
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:06,309
Come on, I need to talk to him.

501
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:09,269
House, you can't
wake up a burn victim
to play 20 Questions.

502
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:11,229
- It's torture.
- He won't remember.

503
00:29:11,313 --> 00:29:13,065
He's gonna be
in extraordinary pain--

504
00:29:13,148 --> 00:29:15,860
God, you're good.
You're putting me to sleep.

505
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:21,200
I know he's gonna be in pain,
I know you disapprove,
I'm his attending, wake him up.

506
00:29:38,386 --> 00:29:41,890
Mmm...Oh, my God.

507
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:43,391
I'm Dr. House.

508
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:44,642
It hurts!

509
00:29:44,893 --> 00:29:46,853
It's gonna get a lot worse,
so answer fast.

510
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:51,274
Before the accident,
did you experience any numbness
or any tingling in your fingers?

511
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:53,986
You got burnt, it's healing,
I need an answer.

512
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:55,362
Ow! It really hurts!

513
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:57,657
Any tingling in your arms or legs?

514
00:29:57,741 --> 00:29:58,991
Do something! I can't--

515
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:01,911
Adam, you gotta listen to me.
Did you feel anything?

516
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:09,129
I pissed my pants
and then I don't...remember--

517
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:14,385
Ahh! Ahhhh!

518
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:49,216
Is he okay?

519
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,134
Get everyone in my office.

520
00:30:51,969 --> 00:30:53,096
Where are you going?

521
00:30:53,805 --> 00:30:55,806
Kid's screaming
gave me a headache.

522
00:30:55,973 --> 00:30:57,601
I gotta take an aspirin.

523
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,836
House.

524
00:31:58,378 --> 00:32:00,255
You okay?
We've been waiting for you.

525
00:32:04,635 --> 00:32:06,972
I'm hallucinating.

526
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:12,479
Hallucinations with migraines
are pretty uncommon.

527
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:15,231
What'd you see?

528
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:17,359
I saw music.

529
00:32:18,776 --> 00:32:20,738
Sensory deception
makes no sense.

530
00:32:20,776 --> 00:32:22,070
Shh...

531
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,202
You took something.
[Sounds hollow]

532
00:32:28,327 --> 00:32:31,248
The kid's fighting for his life.

533
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:37,964
<i># Get miles away #</i>

534
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:41,050
<i># Get miles away #</i>

535
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:43,804
<i># Get miles away #</i>

536
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:46,891
<i># Get miles away #</i>

537
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:49,853
<i># Get miles away #</i>

538
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:52,815
<i># Get miles away #</i>

539
00:32:53,024 --> 00:32:55,818
<i># Get miles #</i>

540
00:32:58,489 --> 00:32:59,572
Hey, you find him?

541
00:32:59,655 --> 00:33:01,617
He was hallucinating
in the locker room.

542
00:33:01,908 --> 00:33:03,328
He okay?

543
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:05,204
He's feeling no pain,
he's high.

544
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:06,623
Vicodin high?

545
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:09,168
Past that.
He's seeing sounds.

546
00:33:09,543 --> 00:33:10,794
Took something.

547
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,715
Why is it so dark in here?
Beautiful day outside.

548
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,303
Open the shades.
Let the sunshine in.

549
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,096
It's nighttime.

550
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:24,142
It's still Tuesday, right?

551
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:25,349
You look better.

552
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:27,186
I took something.

553
00:33:27,477 --> 00:33:28,938
Mind if I ask what?

554
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,234
Uh, little of this,
little of that.

555
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:34,360
I know what's wrong
with our patient.

556
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:36,112
He's depressed.

557
00:33:36,237 --> 00:33:37,906
- He told you that
when you woke him up?
- No,

558
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,743
he told me he pissed his pants
and blacked out.

559
00:33:39,826 --> 00:33:41,453
That's not a diagnostic
of depression.

560
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:42,871
Lack of appetite.
Isolating yourself--

561
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:46,334
Uncontrollable urination
and blacking out are
good predictors of what?

562
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,042
Seizure.

563
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:51,006
Which means the seizure he had
when you tested his heart was
at least his second seizure.

564
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:53,925
So what?
Depression and seizures
aren't correlated.

565
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:56,053
No, but you know what is?

566
00:33:56,386 --> 00:33:59,015
Depression and
anti-depression medicine.

567
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,516
Tox screen was clean.

568
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,185
Yeah, but you know how much crap
he's got in his system for
dealing with those burns.

569
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:08,148
The guy could have the Spanish Armada
floating through his bloodstream,
we wouldn't know about it,

570
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:09,816
'til they started firing cannons.

571
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,571
Antidepressants have been
known to cause seizures in kids,
but not orgasms.

572
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:14,781
This is a brain in trouble.

573
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:17,826
This is a brain with
too much serotonin.

574
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,706
Serotonin affects mood,
appetite. It doesn't cause
a brain to shut down.

575
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:26,253
Antidepressants fake brains into
thinking they have more serotonin
than they actually do.

576
00:34:26,336 --> 00:34:29,966
Every 10 million or so cases,
it sets off a chain reaction.

577
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:32,844
It produces too much,
enough to fry itself.

578
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:35,264
If Adam has
Serotonin Storm,
it's deadly.

579
00:34:35,347 --> 00:34:37,475
But treatable.
Cyproheptadine.

580
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,268
Unless he doesn't have
Serotonin Storm.

581
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:41,689
He could just as easily have
too much dopamine as serotonin.

582
00:34:41,772 --> 00:34:44,524
But if it's dopamine,
the cyproheptadine will kill him.

583
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:46,361
Where are you going?

584
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:48,571
I'm gonna
talk to the kid again.
Seems nice.

585
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:49,614
You can't.

586
00:34:50,365 --> 00:34:51,866
Why? Did he say
he doesn't like me?

587
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,411
The anesthesiologist told
the parents what you did.

588
00:34:55,205 --> 00:34:57,205
Everyone's a tattletale.

589
00:35:03,629 --> 00:35:05,589
Is your son depressed?

590
00:35:07,134 --> 00:35:08,427
No, who are you?

591
00:35:08,511 --> 00:35:09,636
I'm Dr. House.

592
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,596
Oh, you're the idiot who--

593
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,640
I heard him screaming
all the way down the hallway.

594
00:35:12,723 --> 00:35:15,183
If I didn't wake him up,
I wouldn't have learned
what caused the crash.

595
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:16,894
I think he had a seizure.

596
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:22,192
Th-this wasn't my fault?

597
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,697
Well, if he hadn't had
the brain problem,
he wouldn't have the burns.

598
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,992
On the other hand,
if you hadn't put him on the ATV,
he also wouldn't have the burns.

599
00:35:30,076 --> 00:35:32,412
You can debate
your personal responsibility
after I leave.

600
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:33,748
I need to wake him up again.

601
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:36,082
I need to know if he's
taking anti-depressants.

602
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:37,209
He's not.

603
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:39,586
He's the happiest kid I know.

604
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,213
But you don't know, do you?

605
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:45,093
He's my son.

606
00:35:45,217 --> 00:35:47,511
Mmm, that's sort of my point.

607
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,055
At 16, they'll tell
anyone anything.

608
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:51,307
Except their parents.

609
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,849
Adam talks to us about everything.

610
00:35:52,975 --> 00:35:55,186
Yeah, I know about
the pot and the cocaine.

611
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:57,898
- There was never cocaine--
- You sure?

612
00:35:58,232 --> 00:35:59,901
You having him followed?

613
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:02,778
He told us when
he got drunk at a party.

614
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:04,782
He told us when
he started having sex.

615
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:06,575
16, way to go.

616
00:36:06,658 --> 00:36:08,119
He told us when
he cheated on a math test.

617
00:36:08,244 --> 00:36:10,495
He told us when
his girlfriend cheated on him.

618
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:12,248
He doesn't hide
anything from us.

619
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:14,877
- But if he was depressed?
- He'd tell us.

620
00:36:15,377 --> 00:36:18,088
We don't judge.
He's not depressed,
we're sure.

621
00:36:18,422 --> 00:36:20,675
"Bet his life on it" sure?

622
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,721
Just hypothetically.

623
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:26,681
Yeah.

624
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:31,771
Okay.

625
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:35,693
Kid's happy.

626
00:36:36,568 --> 00:36:38,613
Happy, happy, happy.

627
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,781
Then we're back to
where we started,
seizure disorders.

628
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:45,243
Seizure disorders aren't
causing orgasms.

629
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:46,911
Vascular malformations.

630
00:36:47,245 --> 00:36:48,997
Would've seen it
on the sonogram.

631
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,792
Hepatic encephalopathy?

632
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:53,544
Liver enzyme tests were normal.

633
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:00,594
Where are you going?

634
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:02,137
Take a leak.

635
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:11,066
What are you doing?

636
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:12,317
Can't come in here.

637
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:13,192
You're not sterile.

638
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:14,445
Don't touch our son,
we told you.

639
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,323
Seriously,
millions of bacteria,
microbes on you.

640
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:18,490
He'll die of sepsis.

641
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:20,117
If you go in there...

642
00:37:24,247 --> 00:37:25,750
I think he's gonna wake him up again.

643
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:27,293
I know he is.

644
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:31,045
House, you can't do this.

645
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,258
Oh, if I had a nickel
for every time I've heard that.

646
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:36,594
Relax. They gonna sue us?

647
00:37:36,844 --> 00:37:38,971
If I'm right,
I save his life.

648
00:37:39,054 --> 00:37:42,184
If I'm wrong,
he's dead no matter what I do.

649
00:37:42,267 --> 00:37:44,393
Either way, how much
have I really hurt them?

650
00:37:45,186 --> 00:37:46,730
Leave him alone!

651
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:48,732
You're not sterile.
You wanna kill the kid?

652
00:37:49,149 --> 00:37:50,150
Give me the syringe.

653
00:37:50,192 --> 00:37:53,488
- No pain, no gain.
- Hey, you gotta stop this.

654
00:37:57,284 --> 00:37:58,577
You're right.

655
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:02,290
- He's not depressed.
- Yeah, sure.

656
00:38:02,582 --> 00:38:05,084
I'm not letting you go
until you give me that syringe.

657
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:06,836
What's that on his wrist?

658
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:09,380
A burn.

659
00:38:09,547 --> 00:38:11,800
- Why on his wrist?
- Why not on his wrist?

660
00:38:11,884 --> 00:38:15,805
His back, his torso,
everything's a mess.
His forearms are clean.

661
00:38:16,014 --> 00:38:17,099
Except right there.

662
00:38:17,182 --> 00:38:18,391
So what?

663
00:38:19,518 --> 00:38:20,894
It's a perfect circle.

664
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:24,939
So a drop of burning gasoline
fell on his wrist.
A screw from the ATV.

665
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:27,316
Maybe.

666
00:38:37,244 --> 00:38:38,747
Why are you torturing him?

667
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:40,374
Does your son smoke?

668
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,836
I'd kill him.

669
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:47,632
So he talked to you
about sex, crack.

670
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:49,594
Anything except cigarettes.

671
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,013
He has a cigarette burn
on his wrist.

672
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:57,394
Also a fading nicotine stain
between two fingers.

673
00:38:57,686 --> 00:39:00,897
Bad news, you son has
a filthy, unhealthy habit.

674
00:39:00,981 --> 00:39:03,359
Good news,
he's trying to quit.

675
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:05,612
Bad news,
the quitting's killing him.

676
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:07,322
Good news,
I can cure him.

677
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:08,658
Bad news...

678
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,618
nope, that's the end of it.

679
00:39:12,328 --> 00:39:14,037
Quitting smoking can kill?

680
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:16,582
No-smoke meds are
anti-depressants.

681
00:39:16,707 --> 00:39:18,792
The crappy ones
you get over the Internet.

682
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:21,504
They're loaded with
whatever anti-depressants
they can get cheap.

683
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:24,884
Since Mommy and Daddy
obviously didn't take him
to a pediatrician...

684
00:39:28,303 --> 00:39:30,973
Sorry, I was wrong
about him being depressed.

685
00:39:31,848 --> 00:39:33,017
Treat him.

686
00:39:51,331 --> 00:39:52,789
Cuddy:
Hey.

687
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:56,336
Did you drop acid?

688
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:58,963
Why would I do that?

689
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,341
To annoy me.

690
00:40:00,508 --> 00:40:02,760
Or maybe because
you're miserable.

691
00:40:02,842 --> 00:40:06,387
Or because you
wanna self-destruct.

692
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:07,722
Pick one.

693
00:40:08,348 --> 00:40:14,772
How 'bout because LSD acts
on serotonin receptors in the brain,
which can stop a migraine in its tracks.

694
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,026
I'm just saying
it's also a possibility.

695
00:40:18,235 --> 00:40:20,946
- How did you know--
- Cameron is worried about you.

696
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:25,410
I told her that
LSD lasts up to 12 hours.
If you were functional,
she must be wrong.

697
00:40:25,494 --> 00:40:30,708
Either that, or I also took
a whole bunch of anti-depressants,
which short-circuited the LSD.

698
00:40:30,832 --> 00:40:32,419
I'm just saying
that would also explain it.

699
00:40:32,585 --> 00:40:35,047
Thank you for
ruining my clinical trials.

700
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:37,090
Pharmaceutical company's
shutting me down.

701
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:38,175
You're kidding, really?

702
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:39,217
How could that surprise you?

703
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:41,638
You sent them an email
complaining about my math.

704
00:40:41,721 --> 00:40:43,140
Telling them about your stunt.

705
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,516
I didn't know
people actually read emails.

706
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,394
Delete button is
so conveniently located--

707
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:48,228
So what's next?

708
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:50,773
You gonna follow me
my whole life, torture me?

709
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:51,775
Why would I do that?

710
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,401
You waited 20 years to do this.

711
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,820
What's next?
Break up my marriage?

712
00:40:56,863 --> 00:40:59,281
No. We're even.

713
00:40:59,406 --> 00:41:00,532
Right.

714
00:41:02,284 --> 00:41:04,870
Oh, thanks for
setting me up.

715
00:41:08,124 --> 00:41:11,502
Eye for an eye,
LSD, and antidepressants,

716
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:14,173
everything in balance.

717
00:41:14,257 --> 00:41:18,970
Buddhists call it Karma,
Christians call it the Golden Rule,
Jews call it...

718
00:41:20,888 --> 00:41:21,556
I don't know.

719
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,310
Rabbi Hillel said
something poignant.

720
00:41:25,645 --> 00:41:28,439
Universe always
settles the score.

721
00:41:28,857 --> 00:41:29,984
Does it?

722
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:31,736
No.

723
00:41:33,238 --> 00:41:34,907
But it should.

724
00:41:42,373 --> 00:41:45,710
Do you think you'll ever
be able to look at him
and not blame me?

725
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,007
Yeah. Will you?

726
00:42:19,957 --> 00:42:21,459
[Knocking on the door]

727
00:42:42,189 --> 00:42:43,607
I'm Paula.

728
00:42:43,983 --> 00:42:45,275
Hey, Paula.

729
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:46,944
How you doing?

730
00:42:47,986 --> 00:42:51,116
You work over at the college?
Or are you full time over at--

731
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:53,368
I'm looking
for a distraction.

732
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:57,039
You don't need to talk
to do that, do you?

733
