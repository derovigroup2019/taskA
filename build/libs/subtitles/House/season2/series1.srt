1
00:00:02,363 --> 00:00:07,920
Deep fried shrimp, and lobster.
Never had lobster.

2
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:11,641
What, do you boil 'em or grill 'em?
Which one's better?

3
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:13,627
Ah, just get 'em both.

4
00:00:13,628 --> 00:00:15,539
And I know I need a strawberry malt,

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,464
and then there's those
chocolate donuts that come in a box?

6
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:21,807
We'll do our best to accommodate.

7
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:23,787
Tomorrow you'll be moved to a holding cell.

8
00:00:23,788 --> 00:00:28,512
That's where you'll get your last meal.

9
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:32,125
You also have a constitutional right to
the spiritual advisor of your choice.

10
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:33,998
Naw, I don't need none of that.

11
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:35,893
One last thing to think about:

12
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:37,992
After I read the execution warrant,

13
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:40,259
you'll be given an opportunity
to make a statement.

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:49,019
You might want to take some time
and think about what you want
to say as your final words.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,610
Yo, Clarence! You hear that?
A spiritual advisor of my choice! He-he.

16
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:57,026
Don't matter, you goin' to hell anyway.

17
00:00:57,027 --> 00:00:58,730
You think I'll get another stay?

18
00:00:58,731 --> 00:01:02,527
You should. Supreme Court say it ain't right to kill retards.

19
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:06,968
Cut the chatter! Exercise time.

20
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,539
Be back in an hour. Enjoy.

21
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:55,794
Why did you hit me so many times, Clarence?

22
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:57,287
You know why!

23
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:58,297
You could have stopped.

24
00:01:58,298 --> 00:01:59,951
You stabbed me in the back, man.

25
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,376
- I never st...
- You couldn't fight fair.

26
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:03,417
Like you did?

27
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,752
I had a wife and three kids.

28
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:09,811
You are a sick bastard!
Open the door! Open the door!

29
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:12,755
Hey! What'd I ever do to you, man?

30
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:38,453
2XO1- ACCEPTANCE

31
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:07,636
Original Airdate 13-SEP-2005

32
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,690
You can't go in there.

33
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:37,080
Who are you, and
why are you wearing a tie?

34
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:40,801
I'm Dr. Cuddy's new assistant.
Can I tell her what it's regarding?

35
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:44,670
Yes. I would like to know
why she gets a secretary and I don't.

36
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:48,685
I'm her assistant, not her secretary.
I graduated from Rutgers.

37
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,842
Hmm. I didn't know
they had a secretarial school.

38
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:54,945
Well, I hope you took some classes
in sexual harassment law.

39
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:59,618
Does the word "ka-ching"
mean anything to you? I'm going in now.

40
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,439
Dr. House, we are in the middle of a meeting.

41
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,474
What's with hiring a male secretary?
JDate not working out?

42
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:07,296
He is cute. Be careful.

43
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:11,133
She's not like you.
She can't just walk into a bar and
pick up her soul mate in twenty minutes.

44
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,817
I met Mark at a fundraiser
that happened to be held at a...

45
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:14,971
You met me at a strip club.

46
00:04:14,972 --> 00:04:16,793
You were the worst
two dollars I ever spent.

47
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:17,837
We'll catch up later.

48
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:20,442
Stacy, it's House.
I know you can handle it.

49
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:27,577
Nothing to handle. It's obvious
he wants to talk to you alone.

50
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:30,461
If you have a problem working
with Stacy you should have said so.

51
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:32,099
What was I supposed to do?

52
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,205
Ask her to leave?
That's just rude.

53
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:37,976
Death row guy.
I want the case.

54
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,478
How do you even know about him?

55
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,338
You don't have access
to the hospital's mainframe.

56
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,299
No, but "partypants" does.

57
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:46,898
You stole my password?

58
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:49,982
Hardly counts as stealing;
it's a pretty obvious choice.

59
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:54,169
Well, I have already assigned
Death Row Guy to Dr. Nolo.

60
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,647
Nolo? Well, I don't want to say
anything bad about another doctor,

61
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:00,628
especially a useless drunk...

62
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,326
You are addicted to pain pills.

63
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:05,114
But I'm not useless.
Tell Nolo I'm talking over.

64
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:07,512
Dr. Nolo is a board certified cardiologist.

65
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:15,527
Oh, good. I'm sure he'll explore all the usual
options for why a guy's heart starts beating
so fast it pumps out air instead of blood.

66
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:20,311
Wait a second...
there are no usual options!

67
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:23,453
How badly do you want this?

68
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:28,921
I will give you
two more clinic hours this week.

69
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:33,362
Don't bend over for the soap.

70
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:36,393
Cameron: Just the heart, or
the patient have any other complaints?

71
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:38,794
The patient's not talking to anybody.

72
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:40,067
Where are we going?

73
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:41,987
You are going to
the clinic for two hours.

74
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:43,308
Me? Why?

75
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:45,411
Talk to Cuddy.

76
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,823
She's got me going to
Mercer State Prison,
Capital Sentences unit, I don't know.

77
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,678
Aren't there better ways
to spend our time?

78
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:52,079
Good question.

79
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,923
What makes a person deserving?

80
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:57,423
Is a man who cheats on his wife
more deserving than
a man who kills his wife?

81
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,792
Uh... yeah. Actually, he is.

82
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,190
What about a child molester?

83
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:04,956
Certainly not a good guy,
but he didn't kill anybody.

84
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:09,212
Maybe he can get antibiotics,
but no MRIs. What about you?

85
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:12,824
What medical care should you
be denied for being a car thief?

86
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:18,668
Tell you what: the three of you work out a list
of what medical treatments a person loses
based on the crime they committed.

87
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,469
I'll review it when I get back.

88
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:28,343
Your patient shanked
one inmate his first month here,
broke another one's neck,

89
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:30,304
nearly decapitated one of my guards...

90
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,546
Relax, I've got a great bedside manner.

91
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:35,258
Too dangerous to
house him in the infirmary.

92
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:37,861
You don't have to worry,
we've taken every precaution.

93
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:42,225
I've had my men clear from the cell
all pens, paperclips and staplers.

94
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:47,896
Any supplies that
might be used as a weapon.

95
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:49,817
Open her up!

96
00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:59,871
For your visit,
we've got him cuffed and shackled.

97
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:03,332
And yet, you're staying out there.

98
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,338
Uhp! You're going to
have to give me that.

99
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:11,379
Wouldn't want anybody to get hurt.

100
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:13,570
- Hi. - Hi.
- I'm Dr. Cameron.

101
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:14,392
How're you feeling?

102
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,048
Eh. Little cough, no big deal.

103
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:18,137
Okay, then.
What're you doing here?

104
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,222
I just got a job at the university.
They need a health clearance.

105
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:24,393
Apparently I'm a little anemic,
so they made me get some more tests.

106
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:27,256
- Any family history of anemia?
- Not that I know of.

107
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:33,307
My mom died of cancer
when I was a kid, my dad's heart
gave out a couple of years ago.

108
00:07:33,308 --> 00:07:34,313
Brothers and sisters?

109
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:37,817
I'm afraid it's a short
family history. That's it.

110
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:42,589
I had a husband once,
but... didn't stick.

111
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,987
My tests should be back,
probably in that file.

112
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,308
Probably.

113
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:55,588
Is everything okay?

114
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:57,370
Wilson:
Did you redo the x-ray?

115
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:58,331
Twice.

116
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:04,239
Well, you don't need a consult.

117
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:08,090
You know the diagnosis.

118
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:11,691
All she has is a cough.

119
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:21,903
Bluish tinge to the fingernails,
lips... he's hypoxic.

120
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:23,519
What's that mean?

121
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,168
He's not getting enough oxygen.

122
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,234
You know how people say
you can't live without love?

123
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:33,395
Well, oxygen's
even more important.

124
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:38,134
He's got fluid in his lungs,
breathing rate of 50...

125
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:40,017
he needs to be intubated
and put on a respirator.

126
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:41,560
Don't have a respirator.

127
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:44,520
Better get one in about an hour,
or you're gonna lose him.

128
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:46,220
I'll make out a requisition.

129
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,067
The state's already
sentenced this man to die.

130
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:51,517
I think the state was
a tad more specific about "how".

131
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:52,682
This is Dr. Gregory House.

132
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:54,718
I need an ambulance to pick-up
at Mercer State Prison.

133
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:58,277
Wasted call, my men
will stop them at the gate.

134
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:00,946
No way a Death Row inmate
leaves my prison,

135
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:05,867
least not through the front doors.

136
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:11,453
You work fast.

137
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:12,899
So do you.

138
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,295
- Is that a shock?
- Yeah.

139
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:18,815
It was easy.
Once I convinced the clerk
to take it to Judge Markem,

140
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,539
she's a sucker for
Eight Amendment arguments.

141
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,350
Stop, I'm getting turned on.

142
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:23,311
House!

143
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:24,306
Ruh-row!

144
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:26,083
It was just a consult?

145
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,708
You expect us to shut down
an entire floor for this guy?

146
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:30,100
Did you do something to your hair?

147
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:31,061
Stacy?

148
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,383
You said you cleared with her...

149
00:09:32,384 --> 00:09:35,373
Come on. You've known me
how long and still you can't tell
when I'm joshin' ya?

150
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,868
Take him back to prison. Now.

151
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:41,693
No, can't. Ironically,
I'm bound by this court order
which your ace attorney got.

152
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:44,969
I have to make him all better
before shipping him back
for the state to kill him.

153
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,398
Is it just me,
or is that weird?

154
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,639
Anyway, we're walking.

155
00:09:57,912 --> 00:10:00,693
Somebody left this on my chair.

156
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:05,049
It's clever. 'Cause it forces me
to either deal with the file
or never sit down again.

157
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,007
Cindy Kramer.
I told her you'd see her.

158
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:08,205
You shouldn't have told her that.

159
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:11,333
She's got metastatic squamous
cell lung cancer, six months, tops.

160
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:13,604
Have you even looked at the x-ray?

161
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:16,108
No, just guessing.
It's a new game.

162
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:17,989
If it's wrong,
she gets a stuffed bear.

163
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,508
A spot on a x-ray doesn't
necessarily mean that she's terminal.

164
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,754
I love children.
So filled with hope.

165
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,077
It could be pneumonia.
It could be sarcodosis.

166
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,153
Could be, if she didn't already have
swollen hilar lymph nodes
on the other lung.

167
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:37,754
Could we at least
brainstorm for other ideas?

168
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:44,121
Thank you.

169
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:48,055
I still think it could be
pneumonia and sarcodosis,

170
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:50,656
but we should
check for tuberculosis

171
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:57,052
and definitely rule out
congestive heart failure.

172
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:59,087
The five stages of dying.

173
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:02,952
Exactly. Personally, I think
it's all just new-age crap,

174
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,388
but from your tear-filled,
puppy-dog eyes

175
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:06,933
I think I've made my point.

176
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:11,670
Now go tell Cindy
Whatever-her-name-is that she's dying.

177
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:16,634
Tachycardia,
pulmonary edema, likely suspects?

178
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,069
The Death Row guy?

179
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,853
That's who you're working on
instead of Cindy?

180
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:23,092
God, I've got to learn
not to beat around the bush.

181
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:26,587
By dying, I mean
no matter what we do.

182
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:29,100
Very, very soon
she is going to be dead.

183
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:30,835
Is it still to subtle?

184
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:33,359
I took an oath to do no harm.

185
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,333
Yeah, well, it's not like
they make you sign it or anything.

186
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:37,963
We cure your patient,
he goes back to Death Row.

187
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,735
He goes back to
Death Row, they kill him!

188
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,555
He stays here and
we don't treat him, he dies,

189
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:43,516
and I still don't treat
Cindy Lou-Who.

190
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:45,069
Can we get on with this?

191
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,627
Yeah, I knew I could count
on your help for your homie.

192
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:48,784
Exactly, I'm black.

193
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:51,741
I sympathize for guys
who grew up in the city
kept down by the man.

194
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:53,358
Makes sense to me.

195
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:57,567
It's a bunch of crap.
You can't blame society for the fact
that you chose to become a killer.

196
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:02,078
The guy's probably a heroin addict,
which explains the tachycardia,
which caused the pulmonary edema.

197
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,498
How does an inmate on Death Row
get his hands on heroin?

198
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:07,438
Are you serious?

199
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:08,866
The man knows prisons.

200
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,323
When we've got a yachting question, we'll come to you.

201
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:20,444
Okay, drugs it is. Test his hair,
blood, and urine, the works.

202
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:25,826
Thanks for getting my back.

203
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:28,036
I thought you seminary boys
were against the death penalty.

204
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:29,589
I left the seminary.

205
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,713
Over their stance
on capital punishment?

206
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,678
I'm against
the death penalty in principle.

207
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,658
In practice, however,
watching a murder die causes me
a lot less grief than annoying my boss.

208
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:43,904
Guard: We gotta
check you out before you go in.

209
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:47,675
Department of Justice statistics
show that it's a racially
motivated form of punishment.

210
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:51,309
Black defendants are
ten times more likely to get
a death sentence than whites.

211
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,326
Doesn't mean we need to
get rid of the death penalty, do we?

212
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:55,655
It just means we need
to kill more white people.

213
00:12:55,656 --> 00:13:00,008
It's okay, you're in a hospital,
we're taking care of you.

214
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:09,249
Chase:
Stay calm, you're gonna be...
push two milligrams Atvan!

215
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:15,978
Water... water.

216
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:26,527
What's the differential
for being thirsty?

217
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:30,311
He was just a little dehydrated,
and out of his mind.

218
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:31,978
We upped his saline drip,
he's fine now.

219
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:35,982
Blood and urine tests came back clean,
no sign of opiates in his system.

220
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,518
Don't do that.

221
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,778
What, you have some
House theory explaining
heroin use despite a negative test?

222
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,619
Nope.

223
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:47,199
Only I get to write on the board.

224
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,323
So it's not drugs.

225
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:51,411
What else can cause
the heart to do wind sprints?

226
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:54,044
Got the blood work back, any...

227
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:56,592
...thing out of the ordinary?

228
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:59,213
His bi-carb is low.

229
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,746
Yeah, but which column?

230
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:03,236
Could be the result of the tachycardia,
could be the cause?

231
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:04,063
It's the cause.

232
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:05,578
Why, because you want it to be?

233
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,452
Let's see how well that works
with your other patient.

234
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:08,810
We're just talking semantics here.

235
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:11,246
We should put him
on a bi-carb drip and send him back.

236
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:13,111
Right, buff his numbers.

237
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:15,420
Don't bother trying to
figure out the underlying cause.

238
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,162
I thought you cared about patients.

239
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:19,862
Foreman:
Our job isn't to make sure
he can bounce his grandkids on his lap,

240
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:23,071
our job is to get him healthy enough
to go back to Death Row.

241
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:27,152
Our job is to diagnose him.

242
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:32,261
What?

243
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:36,473
Mommy and Daddy are having a little fight,
it doesn't mean we stop loving you.

244
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,097
Now, go outside and play.

245
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:45,898
Get Daddy some smokes
and an arterial blood gas test.

246
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:57,803
Wow. That was impressive.

247
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,067
Okay, what number am I thinking of?

248
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:01,887
Were you trying to get me fired?

249
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:04,915
If you didn't want me working here,
why didn't you just say so?

250
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,491
I just don't want you
working here, in my office.

251
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:09,448
But anywhere else
in the building is fine.

252
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:12,194
- It's a big hospital.
- I'm a lawyer. You're a jerk.

253
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:13,399
There's gonna to be some overlap.

254
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,058
God, I hope that was a euphemism.

255
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:16,684
Cuddy just reamed me.

256
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:19,059
- I hope that one means
what I think it means.
- For trusting you!

257
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,248
She figured when she hired me
she'd at least have someone
you couldn't walk all over.

258
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:26,356
The number was six,
by the way.

259
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:30,619
I need to know,
can I trust you?

260
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,963
If I hadn't lied to you
about Cuddy's approval,

261
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:36,456
my patient would be dead.

262
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:37,417
Great.

263
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,810
Now I know.
Now we can work together.

264
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:49,229
I'm drawing some blood
from your femoral artery.

265
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,935
- From my what?
- Runs through your groin.

266
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:55,911
You think you're gonna stick me
in the jewels with that?

267
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:57,572
It's really closer to your thigh.

268
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:01,856
Technically, at this point,
it seems like your jewels are
more for display purposes, anyway.

269
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:04,593
Hold up, hold up. Give me
some pain killers, or something.

270
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:05,652
Tough guy like you don't need 'em.

271
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:09,973
Forget that, numb me up, man.

272
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:19,909
You got some gang ink?
Let me see that.

273
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,001
It's a Native American symbol.
It means "the force of life. "

274
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:27,753
That's what you tell
all these white dudes
so they let you play doctor?

275
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,610
Yep. Got 'em all fooled.

276
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:34,148
For real, how a brother like you go
from gang-banger to wearing a white coat?

277
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:41,470
How's a guy like you go
from loving a woman
to punching her skull in?

278
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,111
Bitch stepped out.

279
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:46,847
Argh!

280
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:54,150
Sorry about that.
Guess I didn't use enough lidocaine.

281
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:58,483
Blood gas came back with
a pH of 7.28 and decreased HCO3.

282
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,417
Which means two things.

283
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:03,933
Most importantly,
Cameron was wrong about the bi-carb,

284
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:07,741
and less significantly,
we have a new symptom.

285
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:10,502
Anion gap acidosis.

286
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:16,083
Who's chubby? Come on,
pretend he loves puppies.

287
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:18,829
Pretend he's a human being.
What've you got?

288
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,356
I think we should
reconsider drugs.

289
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:22,916
He already tested negative.

290
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,504
That's why I said reconsider.

291
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:26,980
Back in juvie, I cut up
oregano and sold it as pot.

292
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:28,414
Is that how you put yourself
through med school?

293
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:31,117
What if Clarence thought
he was taking heroin,
but it was something else?

294
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:34,771
What "something else" could
lead to anion gap acidosis?

295
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:36,092
Mudpiles.

296
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:37,710
Well, you don't have to ask.

297
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:39,602
Just wash your hands
before you come back.

298
00:17:39,603 --> 00:17:41,562
Methanol, uremia, diabetes...

299
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:44,608
Oh, it's a mnemonic.
That makes sense, too.

300
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:46,654
Paraldehyde,
INH, lactic acid...

301
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:49,055
- Rewind.
- INH?

302
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,366
Yahtzee!

303
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:51,492
Drugs for tuberculosis.

304
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:54,526
Nearly a quarter of the prison
populationis infected with TB.

305
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:58,707
Clever entrepreneur like Foreman here,
chops up his meds, passes it off as heroin.

306
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,249
INH poisoning would
explain all the symptoms.

307
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:08,326
Who wants to head over to the prison
and find Clarence's secret stash?

308
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:13,602
- Fine, I'll do it.
- Great, Chase it is.

309
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:17,235
I assume you have
a reason beyond wanting to
make me completely miserable?

310
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:18,806
You've got a prettier mouth.

311
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,780
Better chance the inmates
will open up to you.

312
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:24,198
<i>Perhaps I'll come out
looking just as monsterous?</i>

313
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,853
<i>I mean, isn't that what I deserve?</i>

314
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:30,934
<i>John, it wasn't your fault.</i>

315
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,386
The man's in a coma.

316
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,036
He didn't mind.

317
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,604
- I asked.
- You're getting crumbs all over him.

318
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:48,586
Why do you think they put TVs
in coma patients' rooms, anyway?

319
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,759
Some people think
they can still hear.

320
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,470
So leave them a radio.

321
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:59,456
His eyes are closed;
who thinks he can see?

322
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:01,769
You know why people
are nice to other people?

323
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,819
Oh, I know this one. Ah...

324
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,661
Because people are
good, decent and caring.

325
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:09,628
Either that, or people are cowards.

326
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:11,547
If I'm mean to you,
you'll be mean to me.

327
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:14,200
Mutually assured destruction.

328
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:17,784
Exactly. You're gonna eat these chips?

329
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:21,985
You gonna get to your point?

330
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,452
You need people to like you.

331
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:27,039
I don't care if people like me.

332
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,367
Yes. But you need people to like you
because you need people.

333
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:35,036
Unless you think you can get
the next court order yourself.

334
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:41,877
If Stacy can't trust you,
you can't use her.

335
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:46,388
And that's not even dealing
with the greater agenda...

336
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:52,069
of getting her to dump her husband
and fall in love with you all over again.

337
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,735
I know you're friends with her, but

338
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:57,829
there is a code.
Bros before hos, man.

339
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:04,218
- Crap.
- What is it?

340
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:06,586
Death Row guy is dying.

341
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:12,896
Bradycardia. His heart rate's
dropped to 30, it's not going
to hold that much longer.

342
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:15,319
Are you just waiting to call time of death,
or are you gonna give him atropine?

343
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,695
Foreman:
Temporary fix?

344
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:20,232
Right. Anyway, those diabetics
are all hung up on insulin.

345
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:21,546
They're just gonna
have to take more.

346
00:20:21,547 --> 00:20:23,602
Atropine's only gonna
buy you a few hours!

347
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:24,592
We don't even know
what's wrong with this guy...

348
00:20:24,593 --> 00:20:27,833
Just get out of here.

349
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:39,384
This is Chase.

350
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:41,572
Did you beat any confessions
out of anybody?

351
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,242
I haven't spoken to any inmates.

352
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,430
Does anybody do their jobs anymore?

353
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:48,626
I've decided Clarence's life
isn't worth risking mine for.

354
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:50,287
I appreciate your candor.

355
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:52,902
Did you even go to the prison
or are you just out playing polo?

356
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:55,183
I'm searching both Clarence's cells.

357
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:57,738
I figure, if he's on something,
it's stashed somewhere.

358
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,471
Unless he finished it.

359
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:00,981
Yeah, that'd be a shame.

360
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:09,845
He could have shoved it anywhere,
there's envelopes stacked to the ceiling,
bottles of copier toner, boxes of rubber bands

361
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:13,926
Call it off.
Come on back.

362
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:35,866
What's going on?

363
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:38,483
You're dying.

364
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:47,925
That deserves a last drink.

365
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:51,244
You're okay.

366
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:55,336
Thanks. That means a lot.

367
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,625
All the tests have been inconclusive?

368
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:06,584
Diagnostics is more of
an art than a science.

369
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:11,025
Should I be worried right now?

370
00:22:11,473 --> 00:22:13,861
I work for one of the top
diagnosticians in the country.

371
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:18,980
We're pouring all of our
energy into figuring this out.

372
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:21,987
Thought you convicts
knew how to drink.

373
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:27,148
You're at least three shots behind.

374
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,111
Now you're four shots behind.

375
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:40,672
You better give me
the next one or I'll kill you.

376
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,420
House...

377
00:22:47,512 --> 00:22:49,841
I was just waiting
for test results, I was...

378
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:54,160
Little busy right now.
Getting my drink on.

379
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:55,961
Unbelievable.

380
00:22:56,446 --> 00:23:02,299
Oof. That's the finest piece
I seen in ten years.

381
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,109
I could've hit that.

382
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,763
And you didn't.

383
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:06,364
Eh.

384
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,967
Then you're the one
that should be locked up.

385
00:23:11,968 --> 00:23:15,797
Tell me something,
I've been trying to figure this out.

386
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:18,438
Why does a guy...

387
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:25,976
...who's on Death Row
suddenly try to off himself?

388
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:30,097
You know, you drank that copier fluid.

389
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:34,585
It's not as visually dramatic
as slitting your wrists
with a homemade shiv,

390
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:38,186
but it'll do the trick.

391
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,501
It just hit me all of a sudden.

392
00:23:45,502 --> 00:23:53,178
It was like, they tell me
when to eat, when to sleep,
when to walk, when to talk, everything.

393
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:57,082
I had to take control
of something, right?

394
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,123
When you die,

395
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:06,514
I figured that was
as good as anything.

396
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:13,488
And that thought just came to you.
Just like that.

397
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:16,572
Man, I told you.
Twenty-three hours a...

398
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:22,164
Mmm. Well, look.
Here's the good news.

399
00:24:22,165 --> 00:24:27,851
The copier fluid you drank
contains about 90% methanol,

400
00:24:27,852 --> 00:24:32,673
which is very poisonous
and you took more than
enough to kill yourself.

401
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:37,069
The bad news is
the alcohol you drank

402
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:44,771
contains so much ethanol
that it's gonna bind with that
nasty formic acid raging through your body,

403
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:51,492
and you're just gonna
pee it out. Harmlessly.

404
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,904
Man, you are drunk.

405
00:24:54,905 --> 00:25:00,065
Yes, I am. I also saved your life.

406
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:07,064
Ha! At least for now.

407
00:25:17,513 --> 00:25:18,713
Morning!

408
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:21,010
Your head hurt?

409
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:23,732
No, you just have
a very grating voice.

410
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,359
You always were a light weight.

411
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,050
Why are you talking to me?

412
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:30,080
Can't it be enough that
I want to cause you pain?

413
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:33,150
The patient's okay now,
you're going to send him back?

414
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:34,711
Absolutely.

415
00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:46,916
Can I trust you?

416
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:48,837
You used to.

417
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:54,723
I still think the patient's sick. I'm keeping him here.

418
00:25:54,724 --> 00:25:57,772
Now, either you can do your job
and keep the hospital informed, or

419
00:25:57,773 --> 00:26:06,408
you can help me make sure
the hospital is not informed
and buy me some time.

420
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:07,685
Chase:
Have you done a CT?

421
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:08,995
Yeah, I have?

422
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:09,652
Does it have contrast?

423
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:16,099
She's done everything she needs to do
except tell her patient that she's dying.

424
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,718
I told you, only I get to
play with markers.

425
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:23,237
Our prisoner has a new symptom.

426
00:26:23,238 --> 00:26:27,095
I'm not telling Cindy that she's dying
until the diagnosis is confirmed.

427
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:32,340
I am not buying that
CLARENCE is trying to
take control of his life by suicide.

428
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,643
Healthy people don't kill themselves.

429
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:36,384
Healthy people don't kill other people.

430
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:41,791
Guy just filed an appeal
in a state that hasn't actually
killed anybody in about 30 years.

431
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,907
What if it wasn't suicide?
What if it was an escape plan?

432
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:48,699
Drink enough methanol to
get transferred to a hospital,
try to escape from here?

433
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,065
Excellent. Explains everything,
except the symptom that got him here.

434
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:58,567
His heart went nuts
before he got stuck in that storage cell
and chugged a toner martini.

435
00:26:58,568 --> 00:27:01,071
I think there's something
going on in his head.

436
00:27:01,072 --> 00:27:07,036
Check for intracranial lesions,
brain infections, autoimmune diseases...
do a CT, LP, full workup.

437
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:11,117
State's paying, so go nuts.

438
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,265
Where'd you get these scars?

439
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:19,981
I got shived my first month in.
After I healed up I got my ass.

440
00:27:19,982 --> 00:27:22,285
You guys still think I'm sick?

441
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:23,726
Obviously.

442
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:27,463
Why you care?
Why don't you just let me die?

443
00:27:27,464 --> 00:27:28,532
I'm different than you.

444
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:31,397
Right, you love me
like your own mama.

445
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:35,323
That's why the nurse says
you kicked her out
when my heart nearly stopped.

446
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:38,204
Take a deep breath.

447
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,210
Any family history
of mental illness?

448
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:48,247
I always heard my pa was crazy;
I never met the man with
my mom, it was the drugs.

449
00:27:48,248 --> 00:27:49,880
Any siblings?

450
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:53,837
I got a brother,
pretty much raised him on my own.

451
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,175
Inspirational story.

452
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:59,275
- He doin' time, too?
- Hey.

453
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:04,672
He's a good kid.
Don't go judgin' what you don't know.

454
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:07,313
How's his health?

455
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:14,156
I haven't heard from him
since I went inside.

456
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:18,467
Spent 16 years with him,
changed his damn diapers.

457
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:29,148
Can you imagine your whole life
bein' about the worst thing you ever did?

458
00:28:31,164 --> 00:28:32,818
You killed four people.

459
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:44,939
Somehow, making mac and cheese
just the way he want kind of
loses its significance.

460
00:28:45,374 --> 00:28:49,340
Oh no. Now you've left
your entire body in my chair.

461
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:50,878
What does that mean you want?

462
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:53,530
I need a segmental
bronchoalveolar lavage.

463
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,772
I take it the CT
with contrast came back.

464
00:28:55,773 --> 00:28:59,092
- They're not definitive.
- Biopsy would be.

465
00:28:59,093 --> 00:29:01,572
Biopsy would be
invasive and unnecessary.

466
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,267
And definitive.

467
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:06,698
But you don't want definitive,
you want to hang on to your
delusions as long as you can.

468
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:08,710
A lavage could prove
it's not cancer.

469
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:11,284
But you need me
to approve the procedure.

470
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:14,188
Must be a bitch.
The answer is no.

471
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:17,429
Why? Because it's me?

472
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:19,779
I'm over you.

473
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,700
I've jumped on the bandwagon.
I hate you, okay?

474
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:27,091
Great. Let's treat her.

475
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:28,892
What is it?

476
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,914
You won't help Cindy but you're
obsessed with this piece of dirt!

477
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:43,448
Are you just trying to prove that
who someone is doesn't matter,
that all that matters is your stupid puzzle?

478
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:52,329
Fine. Treat them the same.
That's all I'm asking. One test.

479
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:57,145
Wow, that is remarkable.

480
00:29:57,247 --> 00:30:00,910
According to those
patchouli-oli selling new-agers,

481
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:03,041
it's supposed to be
the terminal patient,

482
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:06,464
but you're going
through the five stages.

483
00:30:06,465 --> 00:30:12,301
You just made a completely
seamless transition
from anger to bargaining.

484
00:30:12,302 --> 00:30:22,142
Cover two more of my clinic hours,
you can have your one procedure.

485
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:29,715
No lesions, no aneurysms.

486
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:34,512
Ironically, the mind of a killer
looks completely normal.

487
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:37,284
If someone asks you
to describe me to them,

488
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:39,868
what's the first thing
you'd tell them?

489
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:44,309
Insecure.
What are you asking?

490
00:30:44,757 --> 00:30:47,222
Like, if you were setting me up
on a blind date.

491
00:30:47,223 --> 00:30:53,658
Would you describe me
to the girl as the black guy,
a neurologist, car thief?

492
00:30:53,659 --> 00:31:00,259
This guy's really
getting to you, isn't he?

493
00:31:26,246 --> 00:31:30,385
There's no sign of infection.

494
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:35,597
You're gonna have to do the biopsy.

495
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:37,416
Cuddy:
Your Death Row guy's still here!

496
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:40,932
Yeah, sorry.
Just gotta get him stabilized.

497
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:44,335
Probably keep him on fluids
for a few more hours, then off he goes.

498
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:50,026
Oh yeah? 'Cause I'm figuring
that you still think he's sick.

499
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:55,027
Figuring requires deductive reasoning.
I'm figuring that you did no figuring.

500
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:57,517
Stacy just ratted me out, right?

501
00:31:57,518 --> 00:32:00,071
So much for attorney-client privledge.

502
00:32:00,072 --> 00:32:03,434
I'm the client, you moron.
Stacy has a duty to this hospital.

503
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:05,612
- Right.
- I'm sending him back to prison.

504
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:08,213
Whoa, can't. Court order.

505
00:32:08,214 --> 00:32:10,343
Court order says he has to
be declared healthy.

506
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:14,358
Doesn't specify what doctor needs
to make that declaration.

507
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:18,151
- What is it, Clarence?
- My gut!

508
00:32:18,152 --> 00:32:22,410
Would you describe it
as a shooting pain?
A throbbing pain?

509
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:26,106
Or maybe an imaginary pain
because you don't want to
go back to prison?

510
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:26,904
Where does it hurt?

511
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,262
My gut, I feel like
I'm getting stabbed!

512
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:33,937
Well, he'd know.
Let me take a look.

513
00:32:33,938 --> 00:32:41,138
Oh, so everybody lies
except a convicted murderer.

514
00:32:48,105 --> 00:32:53,370
I don't think he's faking this stuff.
What do you think, Doctor?

515
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:11,413
I didn't have any choice.

516
00:33:11,414 --> 00:33:13,188
No, you had to tell Cuddy.

517
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:16,186
She's your boss, I get it.

518
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:18,614
Hitler thought he was
doing the world a favor, too.

519
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:20,709
Yeah, pretty much
on that same level.

520
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,652
Gandhi didn't march the sea
because his buddies asked him too,

521
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:26,753
Pol Pot didn't wipe out the teachers
because he wanted to make friends.

522
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:30,514
You're not making
friends right now.

523
00:33:30,515 --> 00:33:32,070
I trusted you.

524
00:33:32,071 --> 00:33:33,271
I know.

525
00:33:36,204 --> 00:33:41,004
Wilson's a fool.
I'm an idiot.

526
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:44,340
I had to do
what I thought was right.

527
00:33:44,341 --> 00:33:49,609
It's the only reason
anyone does anything.

528
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,516
The surgery went fine.
They removed almost
a foot of necrotic bowel.

529
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:56,160
They're shackling him
and taking him to recovery.

530
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,601
I wonder.

531
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:04,687
I wonder why Clarence
killed that second inmate.

532
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:07,806
Fine, I'll bite.
What the hell are you talking about?

533
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:12,280
Everything we do
is dictated by motive.

534
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:13,784
Why did he kill his girlfriend?

535
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,092
Because he's a maniac!

536
00:34:15,093 --> 00:34:17,014
Is that the reason he gave?

537
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:19,755
She was cheating on him.

538
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:21,076
Jealousy.

539
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:27,281
That gets him sent to prison,
where he kills inmate number one. Why?

540
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:29,948
Guy attacked him first.

541
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:32,909
Revenge.
Who'd he killed after that?

542
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,664
Prison guard.

543
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:37,210
Got a file full of abuse complaints.

544
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:39,705
Probably been kicking
Clarence's ass for months.

545
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:42,110
Clarence is just ridding
the world of bad seeds.

546
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:45,560
Call that one "retribution".

547
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:49,414
Then he kills inmate number two.

548
00:34:49,415 --> 00:34:51,935
Anybody know why?

549
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:56,069
Nuh-uh. It's not in there.

550
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:02,871
All of a sudden
I got to have a reason?

551
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:07,302
It's an anomaly.
Doctors love anomalies.

552
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:11,316
Dark spot on an x-ray,
bright spot on an MRI...

553
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:16,116
Killing that second inmate
is the homicidal equivalent
of blood in the urine.

554
00:35:16,117 --> 00:35:18,395
It doesn't fit.

555
00:35:18,396 --> 00:35:21,562
I'm interested in
things that don't fit.

556
00:35:21,563 --> 00:35:25,163
Tell me why you did it.

557
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:32,268
Your other victims
you were almost bragging about.

558
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:37,309
What was different
about this guy?

559
00:35:38,896 --> 00:35:44,115
It happened
when I was in gen-pop.

560
00:35:44,116 --> 00:35:49,159
I was in the library, just readin',

561
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,116
and I started feelin' real nervous.

562
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:55,717
This guy was staring at me,
I could feel his eyes.

563
00:35:55,718 --> 00:36:01,974
Digging holes in the back of my neck,
made me feel crazy.

564
00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:05,841
Sweat was pouring
down my face.

565
00:36:05,842 --> 00:36:12,442
I could hear my heartbeat
racing in my ears.

566
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:17,179
I just raged out on the dude.

567
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,956
So what's the differential for raging out?

568
00:36:22,957 --> 00:36:25,084
Excess testosterone, steroids...

569
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:26,505
Adrenaline...

570
00:36:26,506 --> 00:36:28,018
Prep Clarence for surgery.

571
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,286
Care to share with the class.

572
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:33,941
Oh, come on.
Do I have to spell it out for you?
Pheochromocytoma.

573
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,948
Actually, I'm not sure how you spell it.

574
00:36:35,949 --> 00:36:37,658
But you said it yourself, adrenaline.

575
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:42,003
Pheochomocytoma sits
on top of the adrenal gland,
randomly spits out oodles of the stuff.

576
00:36:42,004 --> 00:36:43,473
It's perfect, it explains everything.

577
00:36:43,474 --> 00:36:47,497
The tachycardia, pulmonary edema,
the vasoconstriction that cause
the necrotic bowel...

578
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:50,814
Even explains how he had
the strength to rip the rail off his bed.

579
00:36:50,815 --> 00:36:52,155
But pheo's extremely rare.

580
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:57,673
I love rare. Set up an MRI.
Where's Cameron?

581
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,554
Like I don't know.

582
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:07,693
Dr. Cameron?
Could I borrow you for a consult?

583
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:13,151
Bittersweet thing about being
head of the oncology department,
I get CCed in all the biopsy results.

584
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:17,592
Yeah, I know.
She's terminal.

585
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:22,006
Yeah. So I take it you were
in there informing her?

586
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:25,815
Well, I... I hadn't exactly
gotten around to that, but I was just...

587
00:37:25,816 --> 00:37:29,776
Doing what?
Making friends?

588
00:37:30,172 --> 00:37:34,371
Cindy's divorced.
She doesn't have any kids,
no siblings, both her parents are gone...

589
00:37:34,372 --> 00:37:36,446
It's not your job
to be her friend.

590
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:40,542
Do you understand?
And it's not worth it.

591
00:37:40,543 --> 00:37:44,311
She feels better her few final days,
and you're not the same, maybe for years.

592
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:45,278
You don't think it's worth it.

593
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:49,239
I know it's not worth it.

594
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:55,285
My husband w...

595
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,240
I met him just after he was
diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.

596
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:07,961
If I hadn't married him,

597
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,493
he was alone.

598
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:15,839
When a good person dies,
there should be an impact on the world.

599
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:22,800
Somebody should notice.
Somebody should be upset.

600
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:26,886
Pheo what?

601
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:29,541
I don't even remember.

602
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:34,408
It's just a fancy way of saying
small, adrenaline-secreting tumor.

603
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:38,171
Yeah, that clarified it for you.

604
00:38:38,172 --> 00:38:41,446
All you need to know is
if I'm right, we can fix it.

605
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:45,892
Just need to find it.
We need an MRI.

606
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:47,880
It's completely painless for most people.

607
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:49,871
But not for me?

608
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:53,360
I assume you got
those tattoos in prison.

609
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:56,716
Prison tats often contain
inks with heavy metals.

610
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:58,715
The MRI's basically a giant magnet.

611
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:06,636
It'd suck those metallic inks
right out of your skin.

612
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:32,571
Stop squirming.
Don't make us do this again.

613
00:39:32,572 --> 00:39:34,012
Big baby.

614
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,380
Still don't see anything.

615
00:39:39,124 --> 00:39:41,229
Clarence:
Turn it off!

616
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,390
There's Waldo.

617
00:39:43,768 --> 00:39:45,602
<i>Found it, Clarence.</i>

618
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:49,335
Clarence:
Turn it off! Turn this damn thing off!

619
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:53,113
Keep him in there
until you guys see it too.

620
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:55,514
Son of a bitch.

621
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,879
Looks like they got
the pheo out successfully.

622
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,800
So what now?

623
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:12,352
Clarence goes back to Death Row.

624
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:14,433
Just like that?

625
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:16,234
He's cured.

626
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:24,584
That tumor caused random shots of adrenaline,
which obviously led to the rage attacks that
made him a murderer in the first place.

627
00:40:24,585 --> 00:40:26,328
By God, you're right!

628
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:28,810
Let's call the surgeons,
we've got to save that tumor.

629
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:30,105
Put it on the witness stand.

630
00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:32,305
We could testify
at Clarence's appeal.

631
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:34,774
You smell that?

632
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:37,649
I think that is the stink of hypocrisy.

633
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:42,563
You wouldn't even consider the notion
that Clarence's social upbringing was
responsible for what he became,

634
00:40:42,564 --> 00:40:45,677
but now you're sprinting to
the witness stand to blame
everything on a little tumor.

635
00:40:45,678 --> 00:40:48,712
A person's upbringing and their biology
are completely different.

636
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:53,902
Yeah. See, you only
overcame one of them.

637
00:40:53,903 --> 00:40:57,117
Well, let's just give
Clarence a free pass, hmmm?

638
00:40:57,118 --> 00:41:00,485
Course, you're probably going to
piss off all those other pheo sufferers

639
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:06,583
who managed to control
their rage attacks and become lawyers,
race car doctors, and even doctors.

640
00:41:06,584 --> 00:41:13,513
Removing that tumor puts a stop
to those random shots adrenaline,
but doesn't absolve him.

641
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:16,827
You want him to be executed?

642
00:41:16,828 --> 00:41:19,899
That's not what I'm saying.

643
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,180
Got an opinion?

644
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:26,306
Everyone's got an opinion.

645
00:41:29,618 --> 00:41:36,093
I, uh, I think I'm gonna testify
at Clarence's appeal.

646
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:41,254
You'll do what you think is right.
