Bob, what's wrong?

00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,985
What happened? Talk to me.

Excuse me for actually
caring what I look like.

28
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:03,071
I think the word you're
looking for is obsessing.

29
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:04,919
Been at it for almost an hour.

30
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:07,120
If you wanted in,
all you had to do is say so.

31
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,451
I don't want in.
I want sleep.

you got up anyway.
It's almost 9:00.

You. Staying here.

00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:23,478

38
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,659
What, you think
we should try counseling first?

39
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,271
Why do you want to
sleep on a couch anyway?
You got money.

00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:35,597
At least until
the divorce is finalized.

Bob:
It was three days ago.

44
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,040
My throat got really dry
and then my tongue felt like
it was blowing up like a balloon.

45
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:04,174
I assume somebody checked
for food allergies?

46
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:05,789
Well, the first two doctors, both did.

47
00:04:05,873 --> 00:04:09,355
Next one said it was a panic attack.
The one after that
wanted to take his tonsils out.

48
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,172
The last one had no idea.
He just referred us to Dr. House.

49
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:16,085
It says the attack was
preceded by some sort of
strenuous physical activity.

50
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:17,788
Um...yeah.

51
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:19,197

52
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:26,632
Awesome.

53
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:29,656
A sex fiend
with a swollen tongue.

54
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:32,617
Just think of all the places
I can make Foreman search.

55
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:35,788
He's not a sex fiend.
He's a happily married man.

56
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,462
No such thing.

57
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:43,398
What're you doing?

58
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:48,924
Testing a new caffeine delivery system.

59
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:50,635
He didn't get his beauty sleep.

has unusually loud toenails.

which could cause choking.

I didn't see  any sign of trauma,
and they were remarkably open.

64
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:08,632

they admitted participating in
a threesome a few months ago.

65
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:11,672
Hundred bucks says
they're as miserable
as the next couple.

67
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,305
Girl.
His wife's college roommate.

68
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,619
If he's not happily married,
I don't know who could be.

69
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:22,133
They're looking for something.

70
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:24,017
If you're happy,
you got nothing to look for.

71
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,405
His wife arranged it
for an anniversary present.

72
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:29,076
And if you ask me,
if two people really
trust each other,

73
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,127
a threesome
once every seven years
might actually help a marriage.

74
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,967
Okay, I say we stop the DDX
and discuss that comment.

75
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,946
I'll take the bet.

76
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:45,783
Maybe the first doctor was right.
A food allergy explains the anaphylaxis.

77
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:49,581
Could be neurological.
Progressive Bulbar Paralysis
would explain the symptoms.

78
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:52,794
No. ALS would affect
his facial muscles
before his throat.

79
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:54,797
What if the problem's
not in his throat?

80
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,003
That'd be a little odd considering
that's where all his symptoms are.

81
00:05:58,188 --> 00:05:59,724
- Says who?
- The patient.

82
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:03,668
Since most patients can't tell
their ulna from their anus,

83
00:06:03,752 --> 00:06:08,214
I'm guessing this guy also
doesn't know the difference
between choking and suffocating.

84
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:10,532
His throat might be fine.
His lungs might be messed up.

85
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:13,904
Get more blood, a chest CT,
and a body plethysmograph.

86
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:18,214
Unless of course, you think
we should be asking the patient
where his anus is first.

87
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:24,110
It, uh, feels like I have to urinate,
and then when I try to go--

88
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:26,167
Pull up your pants.

89
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:31,182
- It's my prostate, isn't it?
- Nope. Not your prostate.

90
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,243
Herpes.

91
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,589
Herpes?

92
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:35,626
Herpes.

93
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,298
Your  turn.

94
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:41,815
If it makes you feel any better,
half the patients who come into this place
have some sort of crotch rot.

95
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,988
Uh, no, it doesn't.

96
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:47,553
Look, this is impossible.
I've been married for 20 years.

97
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,710
You had any sex
in those 20 years?

98
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:52,216
- Yes, of course--
- Then that's how you got it.

99
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:55,375
The only person
I've had sex with is my wife.

100
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:57,789
Bummer.

101
00:06:58,615 --> 00:07:01,957
Take this once a day.
Tell your wife to do the same.

102
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:04,931
It's not gonna cure it, but it'll lessen
the frequency of the outbreaks.

103
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:07,043
But there must be some mistake.

104
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,370
You got any kids?

105
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:09,055
Yeah.

106
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,195
Any of them take guitar lessons?

107
00:07:11,828 --> 00:07:12,418
No.

108
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:14,109
Tennis, art, acting?

109
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:16,575
My daughter does karate. Why?

110
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:19,357
Give this to her sensei.

111
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:22,420
Oh, wait.
Does your wife play tennis?

112
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:23,333
No.

113
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:26,454
That's what I figured.
It never hurts to make sure.

114
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:29,423
[Rip of paper]
For Miyagi.

115
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:37,277

I need you to pant. Kind of like a dog.

116
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:39,338
[Pants]

117
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,433
That's  good. Keep going.

118
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:46,396
Can I ask you
a personal question?

119
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,121
Uh, I guess.

120
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:57,934
The, um...the threesome.
And...the role playing.
Is that because things get boring?

121
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:00,470
No.

122
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:05,613
We just...enjoy our fantasies.

123
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:10,362
- You married?
- No.

124
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:15,854
You can go back to taking
the deep breaths now.

125
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:20,596
Marriages don't fail
because couples get bored.

126
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:22,967
They fail because...

127
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:27,433
while they're dating, people pretend
to be the person they think
their partner wants and then....

128
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:31,461
Well, there's only so long
you can keep that up.

129
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,425
Maybe they are that person
while they're dating,
but then they change.

130
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,324
People thinking their partner will change?
That's another reason marriages fail.

131
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:45,884
People don't change.

132
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,475
At least not in any way
that really matters.

133
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,006
I think you've had
enough caffeine.

134
00:08:57,321 --> 00:09:00,330
You were right.
It's not his throat. It's his lungs.

135
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,525
Plethysmograph  revealed
decreased lung capacity.

136
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,477
And the CT showed lung scarring.

137
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:09,129
It's definitely
interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
What's not definite is the cause.

138
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:13,505
There's no arthritis, no sarcoidosis.
Uh, he's not on any prescription meds.

139
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:17,504
And he's a wedding photographer
so I doubt he got exposed to
coal dust or asbestos at work.

140
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:19,045
Cause could be idiopathic.

141
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:22,234
Can't be idiopathic.
Idiopathic means
without a known cause.

142
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:23,128
What I meant was that--

143
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:25,166
What you meant was
you don't know what the cause is.

144
00:09:25,246 --> 00:09:28,223
Just say that, and
we can avoid this conversation.

145
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,333
No applause?

146
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:34,694
- What's his current condition?
- Stable.

147
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:36,739
- Then we can wait.
- Wait for what?

148
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:39,620
For whatever you can't figure out
to cause something else.

149
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,701
You know it's going to.

150
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:46,195
It's possible the IPF could
just continue to--
[Beepers go off]

151
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:52,416
There's something wrong
with his skin.

152
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:54,445
Okay, stop scratching.
I gotta look at it.

153
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,026
I can't!
This is driving me crazy.

154
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,107
Stop scratching so--

155
00:09:57,107 --> 00:09:58,738
- Make it stop!
- Okay--

156
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,148
Make it stop!

157
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:02,752
Make it stop.

158
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:11,831
Now we got something to discuss.

159
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:16,197
What causes both lung scarring
and the itchy splotchy red blotchies?

160
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:19,762
It's obviously not
a reaction to medication.
We haven't given him any yet.

161
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:24,825
Right. But what besides
what it's obviously not can cause
both lung scarring and the splotchies?

162
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:25,822
Where are you going?

163
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,405
To complete the second half of
the caffeine delivery system.

164
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:33,532
Either talk louder
or get in here!

165
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:42,912
Same color coming out as going in.

166
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:44,410
You think that's
a marketing thing?

167
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,020
Lupus could cause
lung scarring and a rash.

168
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,757
Or it could still be
a food allergy.

169
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,278
We've already
ruled out allergies.

170
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:51,960
Did we?

171
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,269
Where's Cameron?

172
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:55,024
We're in the men's room.

173
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:58,015
We need an allergy expert in here!

174
00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:03,281
This can wait two minutes.

175
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:04,471
You don't know that.

176
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:07,527
Chase thinks that food allergies
should still be on the table.

177
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:09,106
No, it wouldn't explain
the lung scarring.

178
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,426
Some homeopathic studies have found
a connection between food allergies
and autoimmune reactions,

179
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,850
which could cause lung inflammation.

180
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:19,474
Yeah. And some homeopathic studies
have also found that
ground-up spiders can cure cancer.

181
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:20,837
Can I go now?

182
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:21,945
No.

183
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:27,473
Lungs, skin. Skin, lungs.

184
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,293
Sklungs?

185
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:32,916
Lungs, skin.

186
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,006
Throat.

187
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:41,142
Heavy metal toxicity.

188
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,160
It explains the lungs, the itching,

189
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:47,109
the swelling in
his tongue and throat.

190
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:50,241
I thought you didn't believe
there was anything wrong
with this throat.

191
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:51,933
I never said
I didn't believe it.

192
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:54,132
I just said
I had good reason to doubt it.

193
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,221
And now?

194
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:57,147
And now I have good reason
to doubt those doubts.

195
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,970
Patient's a little old to be
chewing paint off the walls.

196
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:04,733
Nor does he drink well water or eat fish
every day or do anything else that
could've exposed him to heavy metals.

197
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:07,850
He and his wife worked a wedding
in Cabo San Lucas last month.

198
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:11,096
A lot of pottery in Mexico is
contaminated with lead-based paint.

199
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,761
Now aren't you glad
you joined us?

200
00:12:13,762 --> 00:12:17,067
Search their house and screen
his blood and hair for lead.

201
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:20,127
And test for mercury and arsenic
while you're at it.

202
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:21,398
Chase.

203
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:26,146
Find out what the resort cooks with,
and if they have repainted recently
or did any plumbing repairs.

204
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,188
I don't speak Spanish.

205
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:30,448
Then it'll be challenging.

206
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:42,796
Good Lord.

207
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,933
What is that smell?

208
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:46,936
Stuffed pepper.

209
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,900
Stuffed with what?

210
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:51,440
Vomit?

211
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:02,986
Thought you were
going to a hotel.

212
00:13:03,135 --> 00:13:04,601
I found an apartment.

213
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:06,909
I can move in on Monday.
Is that fast enough for you?

214
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:08,114
What's today?

215
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,604
Where'd you get all that stuff?

216
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:13,448
Well, not from your kitchen.

217
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:18,569
Don't you ever eat anything besides
canned soup and peanut butter?

218
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:23,731
Don't you eat anything that
doesn't look like it's been rolled
onto your plate by a dung beetle?

219
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:27,891
Try it.

220
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:35,444
It's good, isn't it?

221
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:36,931
No.

222
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,493
Just better than it looks.

223
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:45,381
How much beans and rice do you think
you'd have to eat from a ceramic pot

224
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:49,609
painted with lead-based paint
to get enough lead into your system
to damage your lungs?

225
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,286
Are we talking a child or an adult?

226
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,400
Adult.

227
00:13:52,526 --> 00:13:53,680
Then I'd say a lot.

228
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:57,235
You'd have to beans
every day for months.

229
00:13:57,615 --> 00:14:01,289
Now, why do you have a season pass
to the New Yankee workshop?

230
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,241
It's a complete moron
working with power tools.

231
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:06,157
How much more
suspenseful can you get?

232
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:08,802
- I'm--I was watching something.
- No...

233
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:10,611
You were about
to watch something.

234
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:13,732
I'm watching something.
See the difference?

235
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,118
If the water was contaminated,
wouldn't I be sick too?

236
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:20,826
People can metabolize toxins
at different rates.

237
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,634
We'll test it to be sure.

238
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:26,863
- Have you done any
recent renovations?
- No.

239
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:29,867
Have any problem
with bugs or rodents?

240
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,919
Just the occasional ant.

241
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:34,592
Use bug spray?

242
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:36,967
No. I hate the smell.

243
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:41,102
Luckily both of us are pretty anal
about keeping things clean.

244
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:43,720
Yeah, I can tell.

245
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:56,622
You think ants are the problem?

246
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:59,087
Can you stop stuffing your mouth
with pancakes for one second?

247
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:02,237
These aren't pancakes.
These are macadamia nut pancakes.

248
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:04,327
Wilson made 'em
and they're amazing.

249
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:08,805
- She said she doesn't
use bug spray, but--
- Silver dollar slices of heaven.

250
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,320
- Some ants are poisonous. Maybe--
- Forget the 72 virgins.

251
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:14,362
If I blow myself up
in a crowded restaurant,

252
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:16,886
I'm gonna be asking
for a plate of these babies.

253
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,575
Is the ant big and red
or small and black?

254
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:20,701
Medium and brown.

255
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:23,477
Halle Berry brown
or Beyonc? brown?

256
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:24,971
Is there a difference?

257
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:28,025
Is there a difference?

258
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,456
Army ants could devour, dissolve,
eat a cow in a matter of hours.

259
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,917
Australian bull ants on the hand

260
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:41,158
are nasty little bastards, but they're
more of a nuisance than a threat.
No surprise there.

261
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,615
Beyonc?.

262
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:44,358
Well, then that's not it.

263
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:46,813
How much clay did
he eat at the resort?

264
00:15:46,897 --> 00:15:50,430
It's a five-star, 400-a-night place.
They don't cook with ceramic pots.

265
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:51,132
Tox  screen?

266
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,421
No evidence of lead,
mercury, or arsenic.

267
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:54,508
Run 'em again.

268
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:57,690
Call the resort.
Find some disgruntled
employee to talk to.

269
00:15:57,774 --> 00:15:59,812
- Go back to the home--
- It's not heavy metals.

270
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,058
- The symptoms say it is.
- The tests say it's not.

271
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:04,078
Well, who you gonna believe?
The symptoms or the tests?

272
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,914
Could also be a food allergy.

273
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,138
Cameron says it's not.

274
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:09,226
If your tests can be wrong,
why can't hers?

275
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,793
His diet hasn't changed
since he was a kid.
His favorite foodis Corn Flakes.

276
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:17,201
Which I assume he eats with milk,
one of the most common
adult onset food allergies.

277
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:20,253
Start treating him for lead poisoning.
It's the most likely heavy metal.

278
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:23,872
And yeah,
you can test him for allergies
for dairy, wheat, and legume.

279
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,374
I am not having an affair with
my daughter's karate instructor,
and I did not give my husband herpes.

280
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:38,325
Found out where House is.

281
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:45,999
If you're convinced it's allergies,
why're you giving him drugs
to treat lead poisoning?

282
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,911
We're not convinced
of anything, yet.

283
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,144
I think I need something else.
This cream isn't working.

284
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,984
We're doing everything we can.

285
00:16:53,355 --> 00:16:54,502
Ow!

286
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,306
Sorry.

287
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:57,605
No, no, it's not my back.
It's my feet.

288
00:16:57,776 --> 00:17:00,235
I think I stepped in something
when I went to the bathroom.

289
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,702
Uh, it's on my socks.
It's burning!

290
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:07,079
I don't see anything.

291
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:08,317
Bob:
Please take my socks off.

292
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:09,729
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

293
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,975
Ow! Stop. Stop, stop!

294
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:15,441
What did you just
scratch him with?

295
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:19,108
If there was an allergic reaction,
it'd be on his back, not on his feet.

296
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:21,531
Oh, God, it's burning!
Please make it stop.

297
00:17:21,615 --> 00:17:23,263
Gonna need some
gabapentin in here.

298
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:30,309
Excruciating pain
in the lower extremities.

299
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:32,583
Not a sign of a food allergy.

300
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,262
Means there's
a neurological problem.

301
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:38,307
More significantly,
it's yet another classic sign
of heavy metals.

302
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:44,579
And I just did yet another hair and blood test
for lead and everything else he could possibly
have been exposed to. They're all negative.

303
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:45,786
It's gotta be something else.

304
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,458
- Lupus could cause--
- No.

305
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:50,524
Lupus progresses slower.
There'd be joint pain.

306
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,429
So it's not a typical case.

307
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,270
- We should get an ANA--
- It's not lupus.

308
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:57,642
Symptoms don't match.

309
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,945
And the tests don't match
heavy metals.

310
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:03,115
[Beepers go off]

311
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:12,068
Maria:
It's happening again.
He's not breathing!

312
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,557
Tongue's swelling,
airways closing.
He's not getting any air.

313
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:19,679
- His lungs are clear.
- We're gonna have to intubate.

314
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:22,165
Try to relax, Bob, this is
gonna help you breathe.

315
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,402
Oh, my God!

316
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:25,221
He's gonna aspirate.
Need suction!

317
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:25,999
What's happening?

318
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,191
Suction.

319
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:30,243
There's too much vomit.
We're never going
to be able to intubate.

320
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:31,574
We need to trach him.

321
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:33,139
He's not breathing.

322
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:58,127
Foreman:
His urine has elevated
proteins and red blood cells.

323
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:01,311
It's lupus-induced kidney failure.
If we don't start treatment--

324
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:03,422
Heavy metal toxicity
could cause vomiting.

325
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:06,378
And so would lupus nephritis,
and it also causes tissue swelling.

326
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,492
He's choking on his tongue,
not his feet.

327
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:12,223
The corticosteroids we gave him
to control the inflammation
can cause facial swelling.

328
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,502
It's still not his throat,
but you're getting closer.

329
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:16,847
I'm doing an ANA and
a serum compliment.

330
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:20,745
If you're so sure,
why waste time with tests?
Just start treatment.

331
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:24,486
Oh, no, wait, we can't do that
because we already have and
it's not working. Ergo--

332
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,667
Corticosteroids aren't
the only treatment
for lupus nephritis.

333
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:31,265
We could also try
cyclophosphamide or
immunosuppressants.

334
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:37,559
Only if we confirm the diagnosis with
an ANA, serum compliment, anti-DNA,
IV pyelogram, and kidney biopsy.

335
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,402
So  now you suddenly
believe in tests?

336
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:43,552
- The symptoms--
- The symptoms all point
to heavy metal poisoning.

337
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,132
Yeah, we all get it.

338
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:48,555
Unless you've got proof and
can tell me which heavy metal it is,

339
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:50,853
I'm starting treatment for lupus.

340
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:02,569
Systemic lupus erythematosus
causes the immune system
to become hyperactive.

341
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:04,197
Attack normal tissue.

342
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:06,860
It could be what caused
the lung inflammation

343
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:11,116
as well as the swelling in his throat
and now what appears to
be damage to his kidneys.

344
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:13,566
The treatment's
usually steroids.

345
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:15,358
But he's already on steroids.

346
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:18,815
If the tests confirm we're on the right track,
there are other medications we can try.

347
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:20,025
And if those don't work?

348
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:24,574
Well, lupus is a chronic condition,
but it's generally controllable.

349
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:26,746
What do you mean, generally?

350
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:31,116
In rare cases, it can cause
cardiovascular or renal failure.

351
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,833
Cardiovascular and...

352
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:37,636
renal. That's, uh, the heart
and the kidneys, right?

353
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,757
Yeah.

354
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:54,142
[Hoarsely]
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

355
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:09,336
Enjoying the salad?

356
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:10,941
There's no lettuce.

357
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:12,657
I'm aware that
there's no lettuce!

358
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:14,671
Do you know when
I obtained this knowledge?

359
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:15,613
Actually, I'm in the middle of--

360
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:16,779
When I made it.

361
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,342
For myself.

362
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:21,009
Well, how was I supposed to know?

363
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:25,974
Well...I was hoping--
This might tip you off.

364
00:21:26,312 --> 00:21:28,080
That's kind of selfish.
Don't you think?

365
00:21:28,164 --> 00:21:30,306
I offered to make you some.
You said no.

366
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,539
Ah, that was before
I tasted the pancakes.

367
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:34,562
It's a compliment,
you should be flattered.

368
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,717
Here.

369
00:21:38,358 --> 00:21:40,852
It's Mrs. Lambert's
herpes test results.

370
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,104
Mrs. who?

371
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:46,711
You've told more than one patient
his wife is sleeping with
his daughter's karate teacher?

372
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:49,569
You wanna stir the pot,
you have to clean up the mess.

373
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:51,293
What would you do
if you got herpes?

374
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:53,202
She's coming in at 5:00,
don't make me come looking for you.

375
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:55,703
Actually, I know what you'd do.
But I mean a normal guy--

376
00:21:55,787 --> 00:22:01,450
And don't be calling in sick, or saying
that your team needs you for
some kind of emergency consult.

377
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:06,953
If he suspected that maybe his wife
had also been playing pickle games,
he could just keep it on the down low.

378
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:08,769
At least wait
till she got infected.

379
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:11,073
You'd give your own wife herpes
just to shift the blame onto--

380
00:22:11,157 --> 00:22:14,026
Oh, he'd give his own mother herpes
if it got him out of clinic duty.

381
00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:16,890
Of course, maybe it was the wife.

382
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,087
Maybe she was the one who--

383
00:22:24,758 --> 00:22:26,296
Where's Mrs. Nympho?

384
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,793
She's waiting outside. Why?

385
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:28,853
Go search her.

386
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,629
What, you mean
her medical records?

387
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:33,959
If I meant that,
good chance I'd have said that.

388
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:37,732
You think she's poisoning him?

389
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:41,670
His symptoms should be getting
better the longer he's here.
Instead they're getting worse.

390
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:45,601
So either she's poisoning him or--
It's not heavy metals.

391
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:48,173
We've done over ten different
heavy metal tox screens--

392
00:22:48,257 --> 00:22:50,730
Because there's no reason
to test for the other 30.

393
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:54,120
They don't get into the air or food.
They only get in you
if someone puts them in you.

394
00:22:54,204 --> 00:22:57,859
And the only way we're going to find out
what she's been sprinkling on
his corn flakes is to search her.

395
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:02,531
I am not going to accuse a woman
of trying to murder her own husband
based simply on some paranoid theory.

396
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,079
It's the only explanation.

397
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:05,858
We've eliminated
every other possibility.

398
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:07,899
We have not eliminated
every other possibility.

399
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:09,652
Has he responded to
the latest lupus treatment?

400
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:10,943
He's only been on it
for a few hours.

401
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:12,927
He hasn't responded
because it's not lupus.

402
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:16,674
It's not allergies, ALS,
arthritis, or sarcoidosis.

403
00:23:16,716 --> 00:23:18,444
She's all that's left.

404
00:23:19,472 --> 00:23:21,191
Do it!

405
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,154
Hi.

406
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,600
I'm Dr. House.

407
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:32,444
Mind if I take a lookin your purse?

408
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:33,967
Why?

409
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:39,499
Because I'm going to need to search it
and you for whatever you're using
to poison your husband.

410
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,876
Why would I want
to hurt my husband?

411
00:23:43,743 --> 00:23:46,301
Then you won't mind
if I search your things.

412
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:51,126
Go ahead.

413
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,206
You satisfied?

414
00:24:05,432 --> 00:24:06,809
Absolutely not.

415
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:10,127
She agreed to let me
search everywhere else,
but this she says no to.

416
00:24:10,211 --> 00:24:11,208
Doesn't that tell you something?

417
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:15,551
Yes, that she doesn't want
some lunatic doctor searching
her vagina with a flashlight.

418
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:16,544
Oh, Cameron could do that.

419
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:17,509
I'm not going to--

420
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:19,513
The woman hasn't left
the hospital since they arrived.

421
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:21,549
Whatever she's using, she's
obviously hiding somewhere.

422
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:22,965
She's not poisoning him.

423
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:24,054
It's the only explanation.

424
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:27,054
No, it's the only explanation
your twisted mind can come up with

425
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:30,164
because you're angry that
you can't find the answer,
and you're taking it out on her.

426
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:34,066
And you are protecting
a complete stranger based on
some childishly romantic notion that

427
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,435
people are all so happily married
they don't want to kill each other.

428
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,538
You calling me childish?

429
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,086
Grow up.

430
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:39,004
Shut up.

431
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:42,123
Both of you.
And stay away from his wife.

432
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:45,145
Sorry. I'm not giving you
permission to assault someone.

433
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:08,029
Let's see. I'm thinking

434
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:12,334
Colonel Mustard
in the music room
with the candlestick.

435
00:25:12,418 --> 00:25:15,785
There's no music room.
It's the conservatory.

436
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:17,585
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

437
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:22,951
If we don't find out what she's using
and start treatment immediately,
he'll be dead in a week.

438
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:24,140
If you're right.

439
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,526
If Foreman's right,
you'd have basically raped
an innocent woman.

440
00:25:33,903 --> 00:25:35,516
My wife fired the maid.

441
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:39,738
Apparently she's getting rid of
everything that reminds her of me.

442
00:25:40,175 --> 00:25:41,525
You did your maid?

443
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:46,230
I was nice to our maid,
which...annoyed her.
God knows why.

444
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:47,584
Maybe she was doing her.

445
00:25:47,584 --> 00:25:50,265
No one was doing her.
All right?

446
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,031
But, you still
feel responsible.

447
00:25:52,137 --> 00:25:55,946
Even though nothing
or no one was done,
it's still your fault.

448
00:25:56,712 --> 00:26:00,361
I offered to keep paying her salary
until she found another job.

449
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:04,462
But she refused to take any money
without doing any work, so--

450
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,755
If you want someone to
clean your apartment,

451
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:08,906
It's on me.

452
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:11,589
You're supposed to moving out,
not moving more people in.

453
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:14,161
She's not moving in.
She's gonna clean.

454
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:15,755
Maybe I should just move out,
and the the two of you could--

455
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,528
Oh, God!
[Machine beeps]

456
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:19,308
- Oh, God, no.
- Call a code!

457
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:22,287
Please.

458
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,710
Charge it to 360.
Give him epi.

459
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:29,390
Clear!

460
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,298
Still no pulse.

461
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,273
Charging. Clear!

462
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:36,692
I got a pulse.

463
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:40,168
Pupils are reactive.

464
00:26:40,318 --> 00:26:41,360
You still with us?

465
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:44,203
He was without oxygen
for less than a minute.
It can't be hypoxia.

466
00:26:44,263 --> 00:26:45,612
Could be a stroke.

467
00:26:45,923 --> 00:26:47,735
Honey, can you hear me?

468
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:48,680
Back up.

469
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:50,867
Bob, talk to me. Bob?

470
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:52,800
Honey, please.

471
00:26:54,152 --> 00:26:56,295
Bob, can you hear me?

472
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,086
He's awake.

473
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:02,112
Can you hear me?

474
00:27:03,562 --> 00:27:04,576
Honey?

475
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:10,000
[Whispers] Hi.

476
00:27:11,468 --> 00:27:16,219
Yes. She is...
quite the little actress.

477
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:23,547
So, let's say she's
not poisoning him.

478
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:25,437
There's nothing more to discuss.

479
00:27:25,503 --> 00:27:29,451
We've got lungand kidney failure,
neurological symptoms,
and now cardiac arrest.

480
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:32,922
A systemic disease with
multi-organ involvement
is the definition of lupus.

481
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:34,497
Autoimmune suppressants
aren't helping.

482
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:37,620
We should start him
on cyclophosphamide.
See if it makes a difference.

483
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,957
Yeah. And interferon.

484
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:43,858
Interferon isn't an approved
treatment for lupus.

485
00:27:43,947 --> 00:27:44,733
You're not still thinking--

486
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:48,150
Interferon isn't
an approved treatment for
heavy metal toxicity either.

487
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:52,511
True. But it's pretty much
the only thing we can do
for a viral infection.

488
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,543
We didn't consider it because--

489
00:27:55,627 --> 00:27:57,511
Because it doesn't make sense.
There's no fever.

490
00:27:57,733 --> 00:27:59,639
Because he's got
no immune system.

491
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:02,694
Thanks to the immunosuppressants
you prescribe for lupus treatment.

492
00:28:02,778 --> 00:28:04,160
He didn't present
with a fever either.

493
00:28:04,244 --> 00:28:07,545
Because at that point, he was
a post-viral autoimmune reaction.

494
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:08,376
Which again--

495
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:12,342
Thanks to the immunosuppressants
you prescribed for lupus treatment,

496
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:14,748
his immune system basically
rolled out the red carpet

497
00:28:14,832 --> 00:28:18,711
for the dormant virus, waking it up,
turning it into a present viral infection.

498
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:20,253
Give him interferon.

499
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:23,723
But if it is lupus,
interferon could make it worse.

500
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,253
Suppress his bone marrow
even further.

501
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:25,997
Which is more likely?

502
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,589
A rapidly progressing, acute-onset lupus
in a patient who's already on steroids,

503
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:32,433
or a team of doctors
missing a post-viral reaction?

504
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:33,960
We didn't miss anything.

505
00:28:34,553 --> 00:28:39,486
Well then, I'm wrong
and you shouldn't--
Give him interferon!

506
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,515
Intravenous interferon has
been shown to be effective
against some viral infections.

507
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,826
But, I thought you said
it wasn't an infection.
You said it was lupus.

508
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,915
The increasingly rapid
progression of the symptoms
has caused us to reconsider.

509
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:56,079
And what if you're wrong here too?

510
00:28:56,305 --> 00:28:57,733
What if it's not a virus?

511
00:28:57,915 --> 00:28:59,913
There are risks
with interferon.

512
00:29:00,132 --> 00:29:03,150
Especially in a patient who's
already immunosuppressed.

513
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:08,215
Look, at this point, you're lungs,
kidneys,and heart are all failing.

514
00:29:08,784 --> 00:29:11,023
We really don't have any choice.

515
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:47,638
[Hoarsely] I cheated.

516
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:49,599
What?

517
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,108
9th grade...
earth science.

518
00:29:54,443 --> 00:29:56,181
Mr. Foley.

519
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:01,171
I sat behind you
so I could cheat off of you.

520
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:09,036
And I let you cheat...
so you'd sit behind me.

521
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:14,204
I thought we were gonna
grow old together.

522
00:30:16,136 --> 00:30:17,637
In 9th grade?

523
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:20,559
No. 10th.

524
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:24,172
What, you had to make sure
I put out first?

525
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:27,282
No.

526
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:30,526
I knew you put out
in the 7th grade.

527
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,864
I love you.

528
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,577
Yeah, I know.

529
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,862
Say you love me.

530
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:50,733
No. [Crying]

531
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,558
Why not?

532
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:57,959
Because...you're not dying.

533
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:01,272
Say it anyway.

534
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:06,456
You gonna make me hurt you?

535
00:31:13,813 --> 00:31:15,566
I love you.

536
00:31:26,902 --> 00:31:28,015
Foreman:
It's not working.

537
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:30,925
Both his lungs and kidneys
are continuing to deteriorate.

538
00:31:31,962 --> 00:31:34,065
- Up the dose.
- We already have.

539
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:35,138
Apparently not enough.

540
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:36,393
I don't think it's a virus.

541
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,204
We've been running titers
for everything we could think of.
They're all negative.

542
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:41,654
[House's beeper goes off]

543
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:46,936
Increase the interferon.

544
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:47,758
House.

545
00:31:47,817 --> 00:31:50,704
You got a better idea?
Other than lupus?

546
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,526
No.

547
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:54,210
Then up the dose.

548
00:31:54,294 --> 00:31:57,441
Mr. and Mrs. Lambert's appointment
was over an hour ago.

549
00:31:57,531 --> 00:32:01,708
Sorry. I was sick.
And my team needed
an emergency consult.

550
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:08,561
Your wife has herpes.

551
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:10,396
What?

552
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:12,807
That-- That's impossible.
I don't have any--

553
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:15,328
You haven't had
an outbreak...yet.

554
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,963
Don't worry, you will.

555
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:20,004
You rutty jackass!

556
00:32:20,494 --> 00:32:23,215
Me? I haven't been
with anyone in 20 years!

557
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:24,769
But you're the one
with the blisters on his--

558
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:26,779
Doesn't mean
that he got it first.

559
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:28,939
You don't need to have
an outbreak to spread the virus.

560
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:32,434
Yeah! And you're the one always
talking about wanting more sex.

561
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:33,442
From you.

562
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:36,645
And maybe I'd get more
if you weren't actually
getting it somewhere else.

563
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:38,765
Well, you two obviously
have a lot to talk about.

564
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:40,543
Don't even think about
dumping this on my lap.

565
00:32:40,729 --> 00:32:43,490
There's gotta be someway
to prove that it's him.

566
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:45,607
I'm sorry. There is no test.

567
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:48,496
Either you two ever
sit on a public toilet?

568
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:50,959
Well?

569
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:52,239
Of course.

570
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:55,459
Herpes can live
for short periods of time
outside the body.

571
00:32:55,543 --> 00:32:57,040
Dr. House, you know
you can't get herpes--

572
00:32:57,124 --> 00:33:01,393
Some politically correct doctors
will tell you that it's impossible
to get infected by a toilet seat,

573
00:33:01,477 --> 00:33:05,870
but they'll also tell you not to use
the same bath towel to dry your crotch
and your face during an outbreak.

574
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:06,837
See the contradiction?

575
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:08,939
I always use a paper cover.

576
00:33:09,168 --> 00:33:11,132
- Always?
- Yes, of course.

577
00:33:11,216 --> 00:33:12,220
What about you?

578
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:13,766
No.

579
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,942
I never knew.

580
00:33:16,715 --> 00:33:18,947
Oh, please.
This is ridiculous.

581
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:22,043
Damn.
I was sure it was Miyagi.

582
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:22,880
What?

583
00:33:23,316 --> 00:33:26,327
He could believe that you can
get herpes from a toilet seat, or

584
00:33:26,411 --> 00:33:29,331
he could be cheating on you
and just be happy to have an out.

585
00:33:29,415 --> 00:33:31,333
The toilet seat
makes sense, doesn't it?

586
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:35,715
Sure, but she'd only refused
to believe such a well presented lie
if she were innocent.

587
00:33:35,886 --> 00:33:39,594
And since you both
can't be innocent...
You rutty jackass.

588
00:33:39,678 --> 00:33:40,846
Oh, you--

589
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:44,483
- Thanks a lot.
- My pleasure.

590
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:47,309
Honey. Wait! Please.

591
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:48,599
Wow.

592
00:33:51,277 --> 00:33:52,964
Not bad.

593
00:34:02,004 --> 00:34:04,516
She has a family history
of arthritis, doesn't she?

594
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,057
Yeah, she does.
What does--?

595
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:08,414
Stop the interferon.

596
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,312
Do another heavy metal screen.
Only this time, test for gold.

597
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:13,199
You don't still think that she--

598
00:34:13,283 --> 00:34:14,822
And don't let her
go to the bathroom.

599
00:34:14,906 --> 00:34:17,441
Why would you care if she--
[House hangs up]

600
00:34:17,671 --> 00:34:18,744
Hello?

601
00:34:58,468 --> 00:34:59,238
Ho!

602
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:00,498
Hi.

603
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,261
I'm Lady.

604
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:05,911
What'd you do to my closet?

605
00:35:05,995 --> 00:35:06,987
I cleaned it.

606
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,977
Uh, Dr. Wilson said
that I could go ahead--

607
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:11,374
It's not Dr. Wilson's closet!

608
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,049
Where's the wood box?

609
00:35:15,203 --> 00:35:17,531
- A wood box?
- Yes, the wood box.

610
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,423
It's made of wood,
and it's box-shaped.

611
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,875
It's been in the back of thiscloset since the day I moved in.

612
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:23,865
I didn't seeany kind of wood--

613
00:35:23,949 --> 00:35:26,923
You may not have seen it,
but you've obviously moved it.
The question is where?

614
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:29,020
Well, I did not move anything, I just--

615
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:32,848
Look, it was in this closet.
Then you came.
Now it's not in this closet.

616
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:35,594
Okay, uh--What type of box?

617
00:35:35,678 --> 00:35:37,065
Wood! Wood!

618
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:40,530
It's a brown wood box.
It's got a metal handle on the top.
It looks like a--

619
00:35:40,587 --> 00:35:42,204
like a tackle or a toolbox.

620
00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:44,466
Ah, you mean the chest?

621
00:35:44,655 --> 00:35:46,506
The one that's under the bed?

622
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:06,268
Do you need to fix something?

623
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,832
Um. Thanks.

624
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:24,915
Well, fine, then I'll go
to one on another floor.

625
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:27,526
Well, actually, they're
not working there either.

626
00:36:28,847 --> 00:36:31,734
Every bathroom
in the whole hospital
is out of order?

627
00:36:31,818 --> 00:36:35,154
Well, they're,
um--The water--

628
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:37,721
I'm going to the bathroom.

629
00:36:42,464 --> 00:36:43,159
Where is she?

630
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,635
She had to go to the bathroom.

631
00:36:44,743 --> 00:36:46,661
- I told you not to let her.
- What was I supposed to do?

632
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,197
- Tie her up?
- Why not? She likes that.

633
00:37:02,695 --> 00:37:04,124
What are you doing?

634
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,644
Uh, your hand is wet.

635
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,424
Sorry. Must be nervous.

636
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:11,344
I got some bad news.

637
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:14,097
What?

638
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:18,406
The damage to your husband's
lungs is permanent.

639
00:37:18,827 --> 00:37:21,742
The kidney damage is reversible,
and with the right therapy,

640
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:24,052
he should regain
full neurological function.

641
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,947
Other than the fact that he's not
gonna be running any marathons,
he should be fine.

642
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:32,053
But that's good news, isn't it?

643
00:37:32,196 --> 00:37:33,649
I'm not finished.

644
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:40,606
When I was a kid,
my dad was stationed
in a Marine base in Egypt.

645
00:37:41,256 --> 00:37:44,895
We were in the middle of nowhere,
and there was absolutely nothing
for a kid to do except...

646
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:46,545
look for a mummy's tomb.

647
00:37:46,605 --> 00:37:50,210
You didn't want me
to go to the bathroom
because you wanted to tell me

648
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:54,991
my husband is going to be fine
and that...you used to live in Egypt?

649
00:37:55,145 --> 00:37:57,599
I didn't have a problem
with you going to the bathroom.

650
00:37:58,222 --> 00:38:00,463
I just didn't want you
to wash your hands.

651
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:05,827
I never actually found a mummy.

652
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:09,000
But, I did learn a fair amount
about the ancient Egyptians.

653
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:14,211
For example, they discovered
that stannous chloride is not only
great for toughening ruby glass,

654
00:38:14,412 --> 00:38:18,180
but if it's mixed with gold,
it turns bright purple.

655
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:29,900
Now either, your fingers actually
are worth their weight in gold,

656
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:34,824
or you've been sprinkling
your husband's cereal
with gold sodium thiomalate.

657
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:39,811
It's an arthritis remedy that
it's rarely used here in the in the U.S.,
but it's still popular in Mexico.

658
00:38:40,446 --> 00:38:42,171
Gotta give you props.

659
00:38:43,894 --> 00:38:46,686
I've never heard of
anyone using gold before.

660
00:38:48,138 --> 00:38:52,541
It's almost...poetic.

661
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:55,636
It's ridiculous.

662
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:59,187
Heavy metal tox screen
for gold was off the chart.

663
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:03,365
Why would I--

664
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:05,352
Because you were
trying to kill him.

665
00:39:06,337 --> 00:39:09,014
I'd love to know
the why behind that why.

666
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:12,697
But, you're not gonna
tell me, are you?

667
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:15,878
You're wrong. I--

668
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,194
I love Bob.

669
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:23,687
I never said
you didn't love him.

670
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:30,716
How does somebody do that?

671
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:36,253
Sit by someone's bedside day and night,
helping them, comforting them,
and at the same time killing them.

672
00:39:36,337 --> 00:39:38,169
Maybe he was
having an affair.

673
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:40,125
Maybe she was
having an affair.

674
00:39:40,232 --> 00:39:44,779
Or maybe she just gets her kicks out of
slowly sucking the life out of a guy,
watching him suffer.

675
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:46,647
He must've done something to her.

676
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:48,041
Yeah, he had it coming.

677
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,360
I didn't say he deserved it.

678
00:39:49,444 --> 00:39:52,169
The only thing he did wrong
was marry a sociopath.

679
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:55,026
Or maybe she just got
tired of being married.

680
00:39:56,201 --> 00:40:01,254
Didn't want to admit to family and friends
that the marriage everyone thought
was perfect wasn't.

681
00:40:01,338 --> 00:40:03,456
Shouldn't of us stay with her?

682
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:04,673
What is she tries to run?

683
00:40:04,757 --> 00:40:07,063
Yeah. Cameron,
go back there.

684
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:10,287
It'd be weird if we were
all in the ladies' room.

685
00:40:40,076 --> 00:40:42,903
Cameron:
We started chelation therapy
with dimercaprol.

686
00:40:45,118 --> 00:40:46,919
Thrilled to hear it.

687
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:50,267
His kidney function
hasn't improved.

688
00:40:50,477 --> 00:40:51,938
It will.

689
00:40:52,294 --> 00:40:54,663
He's gonna need
a lung transplant.

690
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,549
He's becoming more attractive
by the minute, isn't he?

691
00:41:00,723 --> 00:41:02,986
You're pleased.

692
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,979
You think you've proved
every marriage is a mistake.

693
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,311
Do I look pleased?

694
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,398
Ignorance is bliss.
