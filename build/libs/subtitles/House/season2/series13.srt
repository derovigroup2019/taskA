1
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:39,196
Ugh. I think I'm gonna puke.

2
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:40,631
Not on this dress.

3
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:41,879
I'm serious.

4
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:45,259
Kate Moss was doing this at 13.
You have two years on her.

5
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:49,380
Yeah, that's what I like to see.
You got this.

6
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:52,225
Next show, you're bride.

7
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:55,681
Did Austin just offer you bride?

8
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,648
It wasn't a real offer, Dad.
He was just being nice.

9
00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:01,443
These shoes are gonna
be impossible to walk in.

10
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,511
You've done this
a hundred times before,
all right?

11
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:05,022
The runway's just
a little bit longer here.

12
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:06,988
One of the girls said
Madonna's in the front row.

13
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:09,471
Sweetie, sweetie,
hey, come on, come on.

14
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:11,542
You gonna be able
to do this? Hmm?

15
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,686
All right, come here, come here.

16
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:20,385
Here, hold this.

17
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:23,771
The doctor gave me these
for anxiety, all right.

18
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:25,856
It'll calm you down. Here.

19
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,665
Come on, it's okay.

20
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:32,181
Austin:
Where's Alex?

21
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,119
Alex, you're up!

22
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:37,315
Go, go, go, go!

23
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:38,460
Knock 'em out.

24
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:18,832
Are you okay?

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,609
Aah!

26
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,374
Alex!

27
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:47,810

"Desire" by Ryan Adams

30
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,386
<i># Two hearts fading
like a flower #</i>

31
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:36,142
<i># And all this waiting
for the power #</i>

32
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:42,110
<i># For some answer
to this fire #</i>

33
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:45,173
<i># Sinking slowly #</i>

34
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:51,595
<i># The water's higher #
# Mmm, desire #</i>

35
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:58,191
<i># Desire #</i>

36
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:04,595
<i># With no secrets #</i>

37
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,429
<i># No obsession #</i>

38
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:13,227
<i># This time I'm speeding
with no direction #</i>

39
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,561
<i># Without a reason #</i>

40
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:19,898
<i># What is this fire #</i>

41
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:22,327
<i># Burning slowly #</i>

00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:28,922

Wilson:
How'd you get here?

45
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,756
By osmosis.

46
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,180
No helmet?

47
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,143
Didn't seem like riding weather.

48
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:42,121
And the fact that you can
barely stand upright had
nothing to do with it?

49
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:44,977
- Infarctions hurt.
That's what they do.

50
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:44,078
- House!

51
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:48,213
Worsening pain could
actually be a good thing.

52
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:50,106
Means the nerves
might be regenerating.

53
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,533
Could be good,
could be bad.

54
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,298
Thanks for the differential.
Any other options?

55
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,487
Have you ever
considered a career
as a motivational speaker?

56
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:00,749
- Why don't you
check out some rehab?
- I did the rehab thing.

57
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,834
One session.
And you didn't even
finish that session.

58
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:05,106
The guy wanted me
to visualize the healing.

59
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,427
I can do that home.

60
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:08,198
At least let me
get you an MRI.

61
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:11,345
It's a very simple equation.
More pain, more pills.

62
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:13,185
Teenage supermodel.

63
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:18,358
Presented with double vision,
sudden aggressive behavior,
cataplexy--

64
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,415
You had me
at teenage supermodel.

65
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,197
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

66
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:34,531
Wow. You should be a model.

67
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:36,465
Are you really 15?

68
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:37,304
Who are you?

69
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:39,731
I'll be the one
saving her life today.

70
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:42,122
Assuming she's dying.
Who are you?

71
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:43,690
He's my father.

72
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:45,457
Any idea
what's wrong with her?

73
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,464
Well, from the looks of it,
not a single thing.

74
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,379
Probably should stop staring
and check out the file.

75
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,023
So, what set off the brawl?

76
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:56,574
She stand in your light?

77
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,233
I didn't even know her.

78
00:05:58,495 --> 00:05:59,769
I didn't know
what happened.

79
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,615
Look, I know some models
are notorious for hissy fits.

80
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,720
But Alex, I've never
even seen her get angry.

81
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,847
Even when she was a kid
she was--

82
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,671
I'm sure she was
delightful in her youth.

83
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:08,891
And then you passed out.

84
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,755
I was passed out,
but I wasn't.

85
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,059
I knew what was going on,
but I couldn't move or talk.

86
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:16,920
Yeah, that sounds
like a medical thing.

87
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:18,689
It's called cataplexy.

88
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:23,059
Cat fight and cataplexy
on the catwalk. Cool.

89
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:24,728
How much
were you drinking?

90
00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:27,208
She only had
one sip of champagne.

91
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:30,605
Forget it. We'll find out
from the tox screen.

92
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:33,274
All right, look.
I gave her a valium.

93
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:34,529
Do you think
that's what did this?

94
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:37,423
No. How long have
you had the sweats?

95
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,790
- A couple of days.
- Any other complaints?

96
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:43,709
Uh, my stomach's
been bothering me.

97
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,594
And I've been feeling
a little nauseous.

98
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,320
O kay.
Here's how this works.

99
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:52,178
My lackeys will be by shortly to
draw some blood, collect some urine,
any other fluids you got.

100
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,128
They'll do some other
doctorly stuff.

101
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,482
And we'll be in touch.

102
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:05,006
Since when do you
voluntarily go see patients?

103
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:07,862
- Have you seen her?
- She's 15.

104
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:09,594
Yeah, but there's
something about her.

105
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:11,648
Something in her eyes.
A kind of maturity.

106
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:14,796
Yeah, yeah. She's an old soul.
This is creepy even for you.

107
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,560
She's a fashion model
on the cover of magazines.

108
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:19,652
They hold her up
as the sexual ideal,

109
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:23,034
but the law says we can't
touch her for three more years.
How hypocritical is that?

110
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:27,047
Did the history reveal anything,
oh, I don't know, medically relevant?

111
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:28,692
History, right.

112
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:30,164
I  knew I was forgetting something.

113
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:33,172
You should do one of those
while you're running the labs
and the tox screen.

114
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:41,958
Labs show valium
and heroin in her urine.

115
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:44,986
A supermodel on smack.
Shocker.

116
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,422
Oh, Alex. I expected
so much more from you.

117
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:51,090
Heroin chic is
so five years ago.

118
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:54,613
Okay.
Let's start crossing out
withdrawal symptoms.

119
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,628
A positive test means
she tried it once.

120
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,696
Doesn't mean she's an addict.
She's only 15.

121
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,311
There's no age limit
on addiction.

122
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:00,857
He's right.

123
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:03,655
She's never menstruated.
Sounds like a symptom
of drug addiction to me.

124
00:08:03,713 --> 00:08:05,774
Or bulimia. Or her age.

125
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:07,856
Some girls don't start
till their mid to late teens.

126
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:11,241
Evidence to the contrary.
The rounded hips.

127
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:14,383
The perfectly sculpted,
bountiful breasts.

128
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,086
Chase:
Implants.

129
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:18,124
I've seen some of her photos.

130
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:20,038
They've grown dramatically
since last summer.

131
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:22,335
Symptomatic of turning 14.

132
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:26,660
Two clinic hours says
that those love apples are
handcrafted by God.

133
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:29,279
Whoa! I thought
you didn't believe in God.

134
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,463
I do now.

135
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:31,427
You're on.

136
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,656
Could we talk about her health
instead of her breasts?

137
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,148
It could be relevant.

138
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:37,586
Come on, Cameron.
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

139
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:39,438
Many women develop breasts--

140
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:47,638
No, I'm fine.

141
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,205
Even if she is an addict,
a lot of her symptoms--
the cataplexy, the violence--

142
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,668
they could be neurological.

143
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,097
We chalk this up to drugs,
we could be releasing her
with Juvenile MS or Parkinson's or--

144
00:08:58,181 --> 00:08:59,452
So detox her.

145
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:02,868
Fine. We'll set her up on a program.
They'll wean her onto the methadone--

146
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:04,831
And in four weeks
we'll know you're right.

147
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:09,818
Or we'll know that Cameron's right,
and the pretty girl will do Milan
next Fall in a wheelchair.

148
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:15,046
Put her in a coma and
pump her full of naltrexone.
Cut the four weeks to one night.

149
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:21,213
The lab reports show that
your daughter had heroin
in her system.

150
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,759
Were you aware
of her drug use?

151
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:25,570
No.

152
00:09:26,374 --> 00:09:28,870
We think she's suffering
from withdrawal symptoms.

153
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:31,482
Detoxing generally
takes several weeks.

154
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:34,687
The danger is that
if the drugs are masking
some of other illness,

155
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:37,764
it could worsen
before we've weaned her off
of the heroin.

156
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:38,862
Well, how much worse?

157
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:41,071
We don't know because
we don't know what's wrong.

158
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,467
There is a rapid
detox procedure.

159
00:09:44,614 --> 00:09:47,493
We flush her system
with an opioid antagonist.

160
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:49,707
It'll end her addiction overnight.

161
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:54,241
But the process is dangerous
because we have to induce a coma.

162
00:09:54,906 --> 00:10:01,061
It also means that if she ever relapses,
there's a good chance she'll overdose
because her body won't react to the drug.

163
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:02,983
So either way I'm--

164
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:05,632
I'm risking her life.

165
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,046
Do you have to tell her
how dangerous it is?

166
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:21,709
Is it dangerous?

167
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:23,697
There are certain risks.

168
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:25,978
We've gone over them
with your father.

169
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:29,082
And he's not worried?

170
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:30,743
He's your dad.

171
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:33,340
He's always gonna worry.

172
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:36,061
But he knows we're gonna
take good care of you.

173
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:39,410
Oh. Everything's starting to hurt.
My legs.

174
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:42,223
Heroin withdrawal is
an extremely painful process.

175
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:45,288
But we're gonna put you to sleep.
You won't feel a thing.

176
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:48,805
Promise?

177
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:50,174
I promise.

178
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:53,792
It was a pretty
stupid thing to do, huh?

179
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:55,398
Getting hooked on drugs?

180
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:57,658
Yeah, not the best move
you've ever made.

181
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:00,311
Alex:
I just--I thought
it would be fun.

182
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:02,087
C hase:
You don't have to
explain to us.

183
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:05,502
A lot of the other girls were--

184
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,569
When you wake up,
you'll feel a lot better.

185
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:33,316
[Monitor starts beeping]

186
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:46,036
Nurse. Nurse!

187
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:05,417
You son of a bitch!
You killed her.

188
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,573
- She's not dead.
- She had a heart attack.

189
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,189
She's stable now.
The anesthesia--

190
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:11,494
Get her out of that coma.

191
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:12,975
Don't think so.

192
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:17,285
Stop this. All right,
I-I don't consent anymore.

193
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,999
I want to do the slow detox.

194
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,603
Did you ever get a paper cut?

195
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,249
A really nasty one
between the fingers?

196
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,761
Multiply that by about a billion

197
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:34,146
and it'll just barely approach
the kind of suffering she'll experience
if we wake her right now.

198
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,771
We're committed to this.

199
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:42,727
She's out till morning.
Go get a book.

200
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:53,654
I haven't slept in weeks.

201
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:55,728
Because my teeth hurt.

202
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,683
Dentist couldn't find any cavities.

203
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:00,294
And I'm getting these headaches.

204
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:03,362
Oh, poor you.

205
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,287
I think I'm going crazy.

206
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:12,304
And my stomach.
I roll out of bed,
and I want to puke.

207
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:14,413
I take it your married.

208
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:17,307
You must be psychic.

209
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:18,832
You must be witty.

210
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,565
When's she due?

211
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:23,211
- How'd you know she was--
- Because I'm doing her.

212
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,394
You've got Couvade Syndrome.

213
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,460
Which is just
a fancy way of saying
you should stop whining.

214
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:32,542
Millions of women
have got the same thing.
They're not bugging me.

215
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:34,975
You're suffering from
sympathetic pregnancy.

216
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:40,440
Gotta go. People dying.
The whole circle of life thing.

217
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:44,668
- It's all in my head?
- Nope. It's all in your hormones.

218
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:48,219
Good  news is
no one's gonna lecture you
if you smoke and get drunk.

219
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,419
Shouldn't she be awake by now?

220
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,195
It's only been a half an hour
since we stopped the medicine.

221
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,850
Well, you said that's
how long it would take.

222
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:02,179
I said it would take
about half an hour.

223
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:03,397
Well, couldn't this
mean something--

224
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:05,294
So far, it means nothing.

225
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,247
She had a heart attack.
She could have brain damage.
She could have something--

226
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:09,859
She's opening her eyes.

227
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:14,050
Alex? You okay?

228
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:16,098
Can you hear me?

229
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:19,280
Hmm.

230
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,384
I got the cute doctor.

231
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:27,130
Huh. Do you feel any pain?

232
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:30,235
Good. Let us know
if anything changes.

233
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:33,040
If your stomach
doesn't feel right, anything.

234
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,331
Hey.

235
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,541
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

236
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:43,131
I let you down.

237
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:45,718
No, no. Not at all, sweetie. I--

238
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:48,490
I should've been more mature.
I should've handled the pressure.

239
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:50,070
Stop, stop.

240
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,848
We're gonna get you better, all right?

241
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,750
Nothing else matters.

242
00:14:56,351 --> 00:14:58,145
Excuse me.

243
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:03,292
We've got you on
what we call a banana bag.

244
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:05,485
Plenty of vitamins, nutrients.

245
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:07,510
I got the cute doctor.

246
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:14,542
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

247
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:17,262
I let you down.

248
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:18,873
What's going on?

249
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:22,363
I should've been  more mature.
I should've handled the pressure.

250
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:24,001
What's wrong with her?

251
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,971
Anterograde amnesia,
short-term memory loss.

252
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:31,367
Evidence of a hypoxic brain injury.

253
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:35,319
Might be a result of getting cut off
from the oxygen when she flatlined.

254
00:15:35,798 --> 00:15:39,868
Probably the result
of that rapid detox
you told us to push on her.

255
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,095
You gonna put that down?

256
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,181
You gonna sulk?

257
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:53,292
I'm not gonna indulge you.

258
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:55,798
Treatment of hypoxic
brain injuries consist of--

259
00:15:55,882 --> 00:16:00,329
[ Exhales]
Cameron, Chase,
and the dark one.

260
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:01,800
Foreman, right?

261
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:04,944
Patient flatlined
for, like, 30 seconds.

262
00:16:04,986 --> 00:16:08,052
Gotta be oxygen deprived
for longer than that
to lose brain function.

263
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:11,055
- We can't be sure
how long she was--
- Her brain's fine.

264
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:12,068
Memory loss.

265
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:13,916
You're saying that's
not a neurological symptom?

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,763
No, I'm saying
what I'm saying.
Her brain's fine.

267
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:18,981
She's faking?

268
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,534
She's got post traumatic
stress disorder.

269
00:16:21,592 --> 00:16:23,835
We got models
fighting in Iraq now?

270
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,113
Show me a woman on heroin
who looks like that,

271
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:28,414
and I'll show you a woman
who's been sexually abused.

272
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:31,305
That's your proof?
That she's good-looking?

273
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,024
He manages her career.

274
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,197
Travels the world with her.
At her side 24/7.

275
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,858
He's either a very good dad
or a very bad dad.

276
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:41,712
House:
You saw that touckhus.

277
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:44,415
Would the fact that
she's your daughter
really stop you?

278
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:45,533
Oh.

279
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:48,079
Her brain is running
away from reality.

280
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:51,140
When the drugs
can't do it anymore,
it starts to shut down.

281
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:57,084
Your theory has the advantages of
being completely unprovable
and completely exculpating you.

282
00:16:57,492 --> 00:17:00,557
When you guys are done talking,
do an MRI and an LP.

283
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:05,179
When her brain checks out
as normal, then we'll know that
Daddy really, really loves her.

284
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:11,683
Where's House?

285
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,973
Said he was
in too much pain to work.

286
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:14,735
Who's covering?

287
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,587
He called 15 minutes
after his shift started.
It's too late to find anybody.

288
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,875
- Exam room one.
- Ugh.

289
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:28,331
- Hi.
- Where's Dr. House?

290
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:29,830
Wish I knew. Huh.

291
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,378
What's the problem?

292
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,561
It's personal.

293
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,240
And it's so personal
he didn't bother writing
anything in your chart.

294
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:39,350
It's getting worse.

295
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,477
What is?

296
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,379
It's personal.

297
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:46,643
- Fine. You can wait.
- Doctor.

298
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:57,473
I tell you what.

299
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:02,478
I am gonna give you
Dr. House's personal pager number.

300
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,778
Why would your mind
go to abuse so fast?

301
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:11,791
'Cause I had a funny uncle.

302
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:12,905
You were abused?

303
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,334
What? No.
Why would your mind
go to that so fast?

304
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:19,615
I just had a funny uncle.
Great stories, always filthy.

305
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,123
I don't know
if it's something
with this case,

306
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,166
or you got something
personal going on.
The whole break-up thing.

307
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,745
- It's personal.
- House.

308
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:29,844
Your pain is affecting
your decision-making.

309
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:33,644
You got a problem
with a call I make,
question the call.

310
00:18:33,752 --> 00:18:35,112
Don't make it personal.

311
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:37,840
Are you saying pain
can't affect your mood?

312
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:40,216
If I'm right about the pain,

313
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,590
you're gonna want
to rush everything.
Which is what you're doing.

314
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,335
Don't.

315
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:50,783
Thank you.

316
00:18:56,457 --> 00:18:58,212
Are you doing your daughter?

317
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,341
What?

318
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:05,642
We should probably
talk privately, huh?

319
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:07,172
Come on, walk with me.

320
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,417
- I'm not--
- He's not.

321
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:14,944
I'm sure he's not.

322
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:16,969
She is a babe, though.

323
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,961
We're gonna need you
to keep still.

324
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:36,274
I am.

325
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:40,425
What do you think that means?

326
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:43,366
It's either neurological
or psychological.

327
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:46,263
The only thing we know for sure is
it's gonna screw up the MRI results,

328
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:48,337
which is gonna make
House think he's right.

329
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:51,278
This is a waste of time.
Let's just get the LP.

330
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:56,679
I should take your head off.

331
00:19:59,535 --> 00:20:02,268
Your glands are fine.
See, now you're my patient.

332
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:05,574
You got doctor-patient
confidentiality. No worries. 

333
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:07,735
So, what did you do to her?

334
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:11,099
- Why would you possibly think--
- Hard to imagine anyone
not wanting to nail her.

335
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:13,504
- You son of a--
- It's a compliment.

336
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:17,888
A heart-shaped ass.
Those perfect, perky
all-natural breasts.

337
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:19,883
That is my daughter
you're talking about!

338
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,679
No, that's your daughter
you were talking about.

339
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,934
"She just instinctively
knows how to walk."

340
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:29,619
"Designers just love
that heart-shaped ass,
those perfect, perky--"

341
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,744
I'm  her manager.
I have to promote her.

342
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:35,747
Oh, that makes sense.
So you compartmentalize.

343
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,841
When you're dealing
with the press,
you're her manager.

344
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:40,634
When you're helping
with homework,
you're her dad.

345
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,164
When you're making
sweet, sweet love,

346
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,157
- you're her manager.
- All right.

347
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:46,278
Do you love her?

348
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:48,594
- I have never touched her.
- Do you love her?

349
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,451
What are you doing?
You trying to trap me
into saying--

350
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:54,262
Do you love her enough
to admit that you slept with her?

351
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:01,393
Psychology conditions
can manifest themselves
in physical problems.

352
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,851
Sometimes, these can be
extreme enough to kill.

353
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:07,055
There are treatments, but
only if there's a diagnosis.

354
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:13,306
Are you gonna admit that
you slept with your daughter or
are you just gonna let her die?

355
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,968
One time.

356
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:39,456
PTSD.

357
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:43,768
Get her a psych referral and
pack her bags. He did her.

358
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:45,057
Don't think so.

359
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:46,446
Daddy thinks so.

360
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:49,379
Could be mistaken.
He said he was drunk.

361
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,061
Maybe it was
some other daughter.

362
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:53,791
Elevated proteins in her CSF.

363
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:59,393
You're wrong about PTSD,
and I was wrong about
the hypoxic brain injury.

364
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:03,350
Daddy didn't do this to her.
And neither did we.

365
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:16,078
We have to call
Child Protective Services.

366
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:18,082
Doctor-patient confidentiality--

367
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,049
Doesn't apply
in abuse cases.
You know that.

368
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:22,267
Cameron:
We're mandated
to report sexual abuse.

369
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:24,563
Is it okay
if I save her life first?

370
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:28,234
Or do you want to make sure
that Daddy doesn't get
visitation rights to the gravesite?

371
00:22:28,332 --> 00:22:32,089
Okay, elevated proteins
in her CSF could mean
dozens of different things.

372
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:34,206
Viral encephalitis.
CNSV.

373
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,535
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

374
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:38,396
So we're just gonna
leave a child molester
in the same room as his victim?

375
00:22:38,463 --> 00:22:39,869
It's got windows.

376
00:22:43,117 --> 00:22:46,139
Fine. Arrest him.
Use Cuddy's handcuffs.

377
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:48,662
If you're too distracted
to deal with this because
your leg hurts, then--

378
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:50,257
Yeah, I'm distracted!

379
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,278
I'm all hung up on
this 15-year-old patient
who's cataplectic,

380
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:56,700
can't remember what she had
for lunch, and is rapidly
losing control of her body.

381
00:22:56,783 --> 00:23:00,505
And I want her father here
in case they got any more secrets
that I need to know about.

382
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:04,934
Now, if you're not too distracted,
go take out a piece of her brain.
Stick it under  a microscope.

383
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,290
Wilson!

384
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:11,296
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You really think we need to
jump straight to brain biopsy?

385
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:16,143
Nope. Let's continue
playing pin the diagnosis on
the supermodel until she's dead.

386
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:21,980
Heard you killed
your supermodel.

387
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:23,359
Only for a minute.

388
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:26,836
Just for my own clarity,
how many more patients
do you have to kill

389
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,787
before you admit this leg thing
just might be a problem?

390
00:23:30,128 --> 00:23:31,153
Three.

391
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:35,177
I need your help.

392
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:42,692
We're gonna do something
called a burr hole biopsy.

393
00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:46,268
We drill a small opening
in the back of your skull.

394
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:49,238
Doctor, maybe you and I
should talk about this first.

395
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,266
No.

396
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:54,286
I just think Alex doesn't need
to be overwhelmed right now.

397
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:57,549
I think she should have a say
in what happens to her body.

398
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:09,083
We're gonna remove
a small piece of brain tissue.

399
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:12,076
Do--do you have to
shave my hair?

400
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,296
Hair grows back.

401
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,589
I guess I won't
remember anyways.

402
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,236
There's a good chance
the amnesia's only temporary.

403
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:24,404
Okay.

404
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:01,089
Find a way to
kick up the contribution.

405
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:05,581
What did House do now?

406
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:16,031
House, this is God.

407
00:25:16,525 --> 00:25:18,948
Look, I'm a little
busy right now.

408
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,478
Not supposed to talk
during these things.

409
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:23,332
You got time Thursday?

410
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,729
Let me check.
Oh, I've got a plague.
How about Friday?

411
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:30,494
You'll have to
check with Cameron.

412
00:25:30,844 --> 00:25:32,117
Oh, damn it.

413
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:34,927
She always wants to know
why bad things happen.

414
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:37,779
Like I'm gonna come up
with a new answer this time.

415
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,011
House.

416
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:43,287
Quick, God.
Smite the evil witch!

417
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:46,253
Are you sitting on evidence
that your patient was
sexually abused by her father?

418
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,418
God, why have you forsaken me?

419
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,932
Cuddy:
Don't worry. I've contacted
Child Services for you.

420
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:55,476
I left you get away
with more than anyone
in this hospital.

421
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:58,481
Shielding a child abuser
isn't covered.

422
00:25:58,565 --> 00:26:02,528
Cooperate with
this investigation,
or I'll fire you.

423
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,805
Chase:
What do you think
House is gonna do to you?

424
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:09,298
No idea.

425
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:11,251
Well, you did the right thing.

426
00:26:11,524 --> 00:26:13,769
If you hadn't gone to Cuddy,
I would've.

427
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:17,563
If this guy had known
we had to report him,
he'd never have told House the truth.

428
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:20,642
She's a child.
She needs to be protected.

429
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:23,637
She dropped out of high school
to make millions of dollars.

430
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,842
Why does she need more protection
than some crack whore shivering
in the clinic waiting room?

431
00:26:27,994 --> 00:26:30,980
I think you're just
afraid to piss House off.

432
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:32,906
There's that too.

433
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:36,657
MRI looks exactly the same
as it did two years ago.

434
00:26:36,782 --> 00:26:38,874
Nerves don't seem to be regenerating.

435
00:26:39,377 --> 00:26:40,458
I figured as much.

436
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:45,091
Several different researchers
have proven psychological pain
can manifest as physical pain.

437
00:26:45,175 --> 00:26:47,648
You think I have
a conversion disorder?
You want me to see a shrink?

438
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:49,364
Brilliant idea
sending Stacy away.

439
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:50,732
It's really done
wonders for you.

440
00:26:50,816 --> 00:26:53,116
Listen, none of this has
anything to do with Stacy.

441
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:56,711
Right. Giant coincidence
that you've gone completely
off the rails since she left.

442
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:59,228
Inducing migraines,
worsening leg pain--

443
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,636
Ow!

444
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,381
Aw. You miss Stacy too?

445
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:18,421
Brain biopsy shows
no white matter disease.

446
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:21,030
Cameron, you gonna
go tell Cuddy?

447
00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:23,789
Or has she already
got you wired for sound?

448
00:27:25,618 --> 00:27:27,435
I had to do
what I thought was right.

449
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:30,829
So white is out.
That just leaves gray.

450
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,244
Foreman:
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.
Heller Syndrome.

451
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:37,829
Any one of
the mitochondrial
encephalopathies.

452
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:38,962
Am I in trouble?

453
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,287
You had to do
what you thought was right.

454
00:27:42,275 --> 00:27:45,081
They call it gray area
'cause you never really
know what's there.

455
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,100
We can't test
for any of those things.

456
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:48,541
So I'm not in trouble?

457
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:51,079
You can torture
yourself all you want.

458
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:58,494
What if everything we're seeing
is just smoke signals?

459
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,761
Okay.
Who's sending them?

460
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:02,537
Tumor.

461
00:28:03,663 --> 00:28:08,317
If has cancer anywhere
in her body, she could also
have paraneoplastic syndrome,

462
00:28:08,465 --> 00:28:11,205
which would be causing
antibodies to attack her brain.

463
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:12,790
Antibodies are
stupid that way.

464
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:16,004
Paraneoplastic syndrome's
awfully rare in a 15-year-old.

465
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:18,310
15-year-olds who look
like that are awfully rare.

466
00:28:18,394 --> 00:28:23,094
It would explain
the aggressive behavior, the cataplexy,
the memory loss, even the twitching.

467
00:28:23,178 --> 00:28:23,990
It's perfect.

468
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,290
What if it's not?

469
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:28,613
We could waste weeks
searching for a tumor that
we don't even know is there.

470
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:30,379
Then let's make sure
it is there.

471
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:32,742
There's no test
for paraneoplastic syndrome.

472
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:36,241
Sure there is.
The squeeze the tube test.

473
00:28:37,254 --> 00:28:38,762
What did the biopsy tell you?

474
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:40,483
It wasn't definitive.

475
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:44,698
But the twitching
should stop right about...

476
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:46,419
Now.

477
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:51,150
Oh, my God.

478
00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:53,380
House:
Could've just
been a coincidence.

479
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:56,957
Twitching does
tend to stop and start.
Let's be sure.

480
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:06,522
IVIG vacuums her blood.
Neutralizes the stuff
that's making her twitch.

481
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:10,146
It's actually kind of cool.

482
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:16,641
Wonder if I could
make you dance.

483
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:17,162
Enough.

484
00:29:17,246 --> 00:29:19,881
This is unbelievable.
You did it. You fixed her.

485
00:29:20,117 --> 00:29:24,573
No. All I did was
prove that she has cancer.

486
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,180
I need a favor.

487
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,107
I'm not in a giving mood.

488
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:40,692
It'll help us both.

489
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:43,577
I need a shot
of morphine in my spine.

490
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:46,727
If your leg hurts,
take your Vicodin.

491
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,416
It's not enough.

492
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
Get a syringe.

493
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,367
Morphine is extreme,
even for you.

494
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:56,126
Yeah, read that
on the insert.

495
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:58,204
Get one of your lackeys to do it.

496
00:29:58,586 --> 00:29:59,529
I don't want them knowing.

497
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:01,297
That you're on the road
to becoming a junkie?

498
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:02,852
That I'm in this much pain.

499
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,471
I don't want them
questioning my judgment.

500
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:08,564
I can't ask Wilson because
he figures it's all in my head.

501
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:10,426
Well, I agree with him.

502
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:12,007
I'm going home.

503
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,395
Well, what about this?

504
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:18,173
What are you doing?

505
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,053
Is this in my head?

506
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:27,494
'Cause I could swear I remember
a thigh muscle being here.

507
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:32,867
I'll get a syringe.

508
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,994
- It's gotta be cancer.
- It's not cancer.

509
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:30,821
You seem to be back
to your old miserable self.

510
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:35,617
So I just randomly predicted
she'd respond to IVIG?

511
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:37,900
Her twitches are gone.
Her memory's getting better.

512
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:39,088
What did you take?

513
00:31:39,194 --> 00:31:42,834
If the increased pain
was psychological,
no drug's gonna help.

514
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:45,115
If you think it'll help,
the drugs will help.

515
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:47,125
- Power of the mind.
- You're right.

516
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,926
The more I talk to you,
the more the pain floods back.

517
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:54,195
Knew the twins were real.
Chase owes me.

518
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,965
- You check the pancreas?
- Oh, come on!

519
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,168
You're just making up
organs now, aren't you?

520
00:31:59,642 --> 00:32:01,251
We checked the pancreas.

521
00:32:02,156 --> 00:32:04,954
- Obviously you've taken something.
- You check the bones?

522
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:06,661
There are a lot of bones, I think.

523
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:08,370
And none of them have cancer.

524
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:09,752
Ovaries?

525
00:32:09,836 --> 00:32:11,848
There's no mass.
If anything, they're undersized.

526
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:14,227
No leukemia, no Hodgkin's.
We checked everything.

527
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:17,163
Unless they've invented
a new organ, it's not cancer.

528
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:26,534
Differential diagnosis.

529
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:29,747
It's gotta be cancer.
There's gotta be
something we missed.

530
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,445
You gotta learn
to let go, Foreman.

531
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:35,714
Maybe the protein level
was some sort of anomaly.
It might still  just be PTSD.

532
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:40,060
Just PTSD?
Yeah, Daddy's diddling her.
Nothing to worry about.

533
00:32:40,144 --> 00:32:41,644
Chase:
Okay, let me rephrase.

534
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:44,379
Maybe the protein level
was some sort of anomaly.

535
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,964
Oh, my God!
It might be PTSD!

536
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:51,929
If it was PTSD, the twitching
wouldn't have magically disappeared
when we started the IVIG.

537
00:32:52,063 --> 00:32:53,715
Mmm, wrong.

538
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,977
What it wouldn't have done
was medically disappear.

539
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:00,391
Nothing to stop it from
magically disappearing.

540
00:33:00,494 --> 00:33:02,973
She was watching me
stop and start the medicine.

541
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,359
You think she's faking?

542
00:33:05,195 --> 00:33:06,842
Not consciously.

543
00:33:06,947 --> 00:33:11,684
But if her subconscious is
trying to get away from it all,
cancer's gotta be a lovely vacation spot.

544
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:15,266
Tell her you've gotta
give her a fresh IV.

545
00:33:15,324 --> 00:33:17,252
Don't tell her you're
starting her on saline.

546
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:19,376
We'll see if
the twitching comes back.

547
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,186
How long has
the social worker been in there?

548
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:28,366
Just went in.

549
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:30,234
She was in
with the dad before.

550
00:33:30,318 --> 00:33:31,730
You switch the girl's IV?

551
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:33,282
About half an hour ago.

552
00:33:33,793 --> 00:33:35,106
When is she gonna
start twitching?

553
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:38,922
If she's gonna start twitching,
another few minutes.

554
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:42,148
We've gotta wait
for the remaining IVIG
to clear her system.

555
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:45,758
That was quick.
What's gonna happen?

556
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,781
What did you think
was gonna happen?

557
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:50,824
- The father had sex--
- Do you have any
medical evidence of that?

558
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:53,302
- He admitted--
- He denies that conversation
ever took place.

559
00:33:53,302 --> 00:33:55,233
- She--
- She denies it too.

560
00:33:55,407 --> 00:33:57,012
I'm sure you meant well.

561
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:07,987
[Alex flipping through TV channels]

562
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,187
You have to tell her the truth.

563
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:11,454
Nothing happened.

564
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,981
You don't have to
be afraid of him.
They can protect you.

565
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,917
From what?
Things are fine.

566
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:21,349
You think things are fine.
They're not.

567
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:22,393
He's my dad.

568
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,892
He's abusing you.

569
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:26,597
He's not a bad person.

570
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:29,692
I seduced him.

571
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:33,724
You're the child.
He's the adult.

572
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:36,880
- He has the responsibility--
- I got him drunk.

573
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:39,562
I had to get him drunk.

574
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:42,071
I wanted to
have sex with him.

575
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:45,181
You're sexually
attracted to your father?

576
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:46,317
No.

577
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:52,494
But by sleeping with him,
now he lets me do whatever I want.

578
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:59,633
I also slept with my photographer,
my financial manager, and my tutor.

579
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:08,217
If I hadn't, I'd be getting Cs
and posing for newspaper ads
back in Detroit.

580
00:35:09,071 --> 00:35:11,539
Hmm. Come on.
We all do it.

581
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,109
No, we don't.

582
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:16,906
After you father slept with you,
you were traumatized.

583
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,872
My dad was last.

584
00:35:21,259 --> 00:35:27,320
You've never taken a run
at your boss or a professor
or somebody else you needed?

585
00:35:28,817 --> 00:35:30,425
You're 15.

586
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:32,787
You're smart.
You don't have to--

587
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:35,692
I am not that smart.

588
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:39,240
I am that beautiful.

589
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,358
What's wrong with me?

590
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:59,546
Aw! George,
get your butt over here!

591
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,189
George:
Help me!

592
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,451
How did you get
my pager number?

593
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:03,407
Please!

594
00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:06,919
Problem is
if I give you an epidural,

595
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:08,872
you won't be able
to feel when to push.

596
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:11,073
- You're not funny!
- Pretty sure I am.

597
00:36:11,157 --> 00:36:13,176
You just can't appreciate it
because you're in pain.

598
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:16,288
George, if you don't
get off your ass and help me--

599
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:18,541
Oh, shut up!

600
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:22,796
Got yourself
the perfect man: a woman.

601
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:25,567
He's got more estrogen
coursing through his veins than--

602
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:30,334
Oh! Aw! Ohhhhhh!

603
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:33,965
- Who did her vaginal exam?
- I did.

604
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:35,287
Did she have hair?

605
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:36,570
What are you getting at?

606
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:39,337
Right now I'm getting at
whether or not she had hair
down there.

607
00:36:39,415 --> 00:36:41,298
Uh, not much.

608
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:44,262
She manipulative
yet completely docile.

609
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:47,558
Everybody tells us
that outburst on the catwalk
was out of character.

610
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:49,117
She's never had a period.

611
00:36:49,222 --> 00:36:50,645
You're thinking
this is hormonal?

612
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:53,165
I'm thinking
she's the ultimate woman.

613
00:36:53,354 --> 00:36:57,433
I-I need to schedule an MRI.

614
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:00,923
The twitching stopped.

615
00:37:01,874 --> 00:37:06,182
Because we changed your medicine
back to the real stuff. Stop talking.

616
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:08,711
You gave me fake medicine?

617
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:10,753
That's what I said.

618
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,562
In the vain hope that
you wouldn't feel
the need to also say it.

619
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:15,088
Stop talking.

620
00:37:15,918 --> 00:37:19,133
Wilson already did an ultrasound.
Said her ovaries were undersized.

621
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:23,013
The ultrasound would be the way to go
if you were looking for ovarian cancer.

622
00:37:23,111 --> 00:37:24,879
What are we looking for?

623
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,720
That.

624
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,618
Oh, my God.

625
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:36,980
Looks like a tumor, doesn't it?

626
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:39,388
But those are--

627
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:40,909
Yep.

628
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,461
We found a tumor.

629
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,317
She has cancer?

630
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:04,039
Technically, no.

631
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:06,113
So it's not cancer?

632
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:10,895
No, it's cancer.
But he has cancer.

633
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,727
On his left testicle.

634
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:19,247
I don't have testicles.

635
00:38:19,353 --> 00:38:20,843
She's not a guy.

636
00:38:21,046 --> 00:38:23,711
His DNA says you're wrong.

637
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:27,711
Frogs and snails
and puppy dog tails.

638
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:31,984
You've got male
pseudohermaphroditism.

639
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:34,219
See, we all start out as girls.

640
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:37,289
And then we're differentiated
based on our genes.

641
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:41,910
The ovaries develop
into testes and drop.

642
00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:50,407
But in about 1 and 150,000 pregnancies
a fetus with an XY chromosome, a boy,
develops into something else.

643
00:38:50,701 --> 00:38:52,271
Like you.

644
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,979
Your testes never descended

645
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:57,469
because you're
immune to testosterone.

646
00:38:57,932 --> 00:38:59,840
You're pure estrogen.

647
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:03,445
Which is why you get
heightened female characteristics.

648
00:39:03,872 --> 00:39:07,670
Clear skin. Great breasts.

649
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:12,749
The ultimate woman is a man.

650
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,287
Nature's cruel, huh?

651
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:20,518
This is obviously a joke.
This is--is impossible.

652
00:39:20,977 --> 00:39:24,585
No, a joke would be
me calling you a homo.

653
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:26,400
See the difference?

654
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:30,293
I'll schedule him for surgery.

655
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:36,216
No. You're wrong.
I'm a girl.

656
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,814
Look at me!
How can you say
I'm not a girl?

657
00:39:39,898 --> 00:39:41,916
See? They're all
looking at me. I'm--

658
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,774
I'm beautiful!

659
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:49,899
That anger,
that's just the cancer talking.

660
00:39:52,894 --> 00:39:55,936
Put your clothes back on.
I'm gonna cut your balls off.

661
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:57,942
Then you'll be fine.

662
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:33,167
How's the patient?

663
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,706
Post-op.

664
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:39,181
I set him/her up
for a psych visit.

665
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:42,374
Calling her "him/her"
isn't really helping.

666
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,478
Good news is I don't think
Dad's gonna be sleeping
with him/her again.

667
00:40:46,562 --> 00:40:48,297
See, now it's gross.

668
00:40:53,207 --> 00:40:55,047
I need another shot.

669
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,959
When did the pain
start coming back?

670
00:40:58,043 --> 00:40:59,543
A few hours ago.

671
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:02,227
About an hour after
you solved the case?

672
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:07,279
If I wanted to be psychoanalyzed,
I'd get Wilson to give me the shot.

673
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:09,347
Same dosage?

674
00:41:10,986 --> 00:41:15,418
If you'd be comfortable,
I might be able to deal with
a few less cc's of morphine.

675
00:41:15,648 --> 00:41:17,502
It wasn't morphine.

676
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,054
