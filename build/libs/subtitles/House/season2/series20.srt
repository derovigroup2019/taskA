00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,630
Hey,guys!

2
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,210
Guess he got away.

3
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,540
Can baby shoes come out to play?

4
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:06,870
Come on.

5
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,580
Hands on your head,climb out.

6
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,040
I can't climb out if my hands are on my head.

7
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,420
Just keep 'em where i can see 'em,man.

8
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,070
Go 'head. Go 'head.Come on.

9
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,000
You high,popo?

10
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,170
Yeah,man.

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,900
Catchin' morons makes me high.

12
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,020
Take your shirt off by your collar and turn around.

13
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,390
Whoo,would you  look at that!

14
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,860
Dude's got a weapon.

15
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,340
All right,you have the right to remain...stupid!

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,810
Watch the gun.

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,430
Anything you say will be completely incomprehensible.

18
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,500
Seriously,man,careful!

19
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,890
Seriously,man?Seriously?

20
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,370
Your mama know what you do?!

Season 2 Episode 20

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,700
Aww...that's sweet.

25
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,930
Your dad's proud.You made the local paper.
--From my article.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,410
Give it a rest.

27
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,820
You read what he wrote in the margin?

28
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,830
"Our friend lazarus sleeps,but I go that i may wake him up."

29
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,920
He's not proud of me.He's proud of jesus.

30
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,630
Everything I do right is god's work.

31
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,730
Everything I do wrong is my own damn fault.

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,180
Cop with a sense of humor.

33
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,050
Differential diagnosis.

34
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,880
Guy's in the E.R.,Bleeding on everybody.

35
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,790
Drugs?

36
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,440
He's a cop.

37
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,120
Good point.How about...drugs?

38
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,300
Tox screen was clean.

39
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,010
He did,however,get hit by a bullet.

40
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,720
Just mentioning it.

41
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,670
He was shot?

42
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,810
No,somebody threw it at him.

43
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,850
I'm thinking trauma.He's got bullet fragments lodged in his brain.

44
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,820
According to baby shoes,the cop was laughing before he got shot.

45
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,590
Baby shoes?

46
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,510
--Guy who shot him.--Reliable witness.

47
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,340
His name is baby shoes.How bad can he be?

48
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,030
Fragments are in the wrong part of the brain to cause euphoria.

49
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,580
So let's expand the search.Factor in the cough and the cloudy lungs.

50
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,650
Why are we ignoring the elevated heart rate?--'Cause he's in shock.

51
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,200
What if the heart was already fast before he got shot?

52
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,600
You mean after the foot race?

53
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,560
He's giddy.Indicates a blockage of oxygen.

54
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,890
Carbon monoxide gas would elevate the heart rate

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,170
and cause coughing and impair neurological functions.

56
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,030
He got co poisoning outdoors?

57
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,250
Yeah.

58
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,460
All 'cause those bastards didn't ratify kyoto.

59
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,050
Or he got co poisoning indoors

60
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,540
and moved outdoors before he'd inhaled enough to make him drop dead.

61
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,520
Test his arterial blood gas.If his carboxy hemoglobin levels are higher than 15%,

62
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,400
stick him in a hyperbaric chamber.

63
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,400
You go check the cop car for gas leaks or--

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,410
if it was the cop car,his partner would be sick.

65
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,490
Well,maybe she is she just doesn't have as good a sense of humor.

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,720
Also check his personal cars,work,home.

67
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,610
I'll check the precinct.

68
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,500
Blood tests confirm you have low-level carbon monoxide poisoning.

69
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,380
We're putting you inside a high-pressure chamber to...

70
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,980
You don't really care,do you?

71
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,540
Do you live near a gas supply?

72
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,160
Uh,yeah,me.

73
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,710
After,like,a huge enchilada.

74
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,200
Anything toxic you have at your home?

75
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,270
Any paint solvents,anything unhygienic?

76
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,020
Uh,no.

77
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,190
No,I keep a pretty clean home.

78
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,980
If you start having trouble breathing,you can press this button,

79
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,390
and the chamber will decompress.

80
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,440
Like this?

81
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,400
Don't now.If you have trouble.

82
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,120
Ah,it's broken.

83
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,340
All right,well,if you have problems we'll push it for you.

84
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,810
Muscle contracture.

85
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,070
How bad does it hurt?

86
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,080
Not...not at all.

87
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,020
Looks wild,though,huh?

88
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,720
Your brain's not getting enough oxygen.You're losing motor function.

89
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,630
We should start this right away.

90
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,370
Should I be scared?

91
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,700
No,you probably have a carbon monoxide leak in your place.

92
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,030
We have a guy there checking things out.

93
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,310
Sounds okay.

94
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,920
How about the gas intake valve?

95
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,010
Looks great.

96
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,060
It's down in the furnace room.

97
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,710
Your system's fine.

98
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,760
If you had a carbon monoxide leak,half the force would be sick.

99
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,570
Then why are you here?

100
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,170
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.

101
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,690
Yeah.I've,uh...I've got a disability.

102
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,960
These are speeding tickets.

103
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,340
A lot of emergencies.

104
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,820
He's feeling better now,but...you never know.

105
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,980
I'll see what we can do.

106
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,490
Where's your partner sit?

107
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,660
Place is a cesspool,but I don't think I need to test for anything.

108
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,070
Nope,waste of time.

109
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,930
You know about the marijuana?

110
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,950
I've heard rumors since junior high.

111
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,460
The cop's acting high because he is high.

112
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,210
He's got--legionnaires' disease.

113
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,490
It's a good thing joe got shot.

114
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,690
The whole precinct would have got wiped out.Anarchy on the streets.

115
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,780
Takes 48 hours to test for legionnaire'S.

116
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,880
And only two seconds to recognize if the symptoms fit

117
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,060
while staring at the rancid,unchanged water of an ac unit.

118
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,860
Marijuana explains the high carboxy,the cloudy lungs,and the happiness.

119
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,750
Pot doesn't explain the fact that he's gotten worse since he was admitted.

120
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,250
Why don't we agree to disagree?

121
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Actually,why don't we agree that you'll disagree with me

122
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,170
while treating him for legionnaire's?It's not as pithy,but...

123
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,270
I feel a lot better.The meds are working.

124
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,640
Heart rate's normal.Cohp levels are down.No fever.

125
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,250
Take some deep breaths.

126
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,300
You seem disappointed.

127
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,240
I'm glad you're feeling better.

128
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,950
You got a problem with cops?

129
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,210
Please don't talk.

130
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,540
In my experience,people who just don't like cops have a reason--

131
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,210
I need you not to talk.

132
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,160
No rales.

133
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,220
these clouded areas of the upperobes...they're the infiltrates we found yesterday.

134
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,400
Not there anymore?

135
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,360
They're clearing up.You had legionnaire'S.

136
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,030
Now you don'T.

137
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,500
So you didn't,um...you didn't find anything at my place?

138
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,770
Nothing...medically relevant.

139
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,010
So there's,uh...there's nothing I need to worry about,then?

140
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,850
Not this time.

141
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,180
Whatcha doing?

142
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,330
I want to make sure he sees what's involved.

143
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,530
What we found was fairly advanced.

144
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,420
These cloudy areas here,and here.

145
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,220
These parts of your lungs simply weren't functioning.

146
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,530
They're okay now,right?

147
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,130
Everything's okay now?

148
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm fine.

149
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,630
You're blind.

150
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,040
I bumped into something.That doesn't mean I can't see.

151
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,100
I'm sure it's frightening,but you only think--

152
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,060
what's dr. Cameron wearing?

153
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,830
Dark blue pants,white shirt.Black shoes.

154
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,080
Ooh,almost.'Cept for the pants,shirt,and shoes.You're blind.

155
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,470
he really thinks he can see?

156
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,870
He can physically see.His brain just can't process it.

157
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,570
No chance this is a practical joke?

158
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,870
No way.

159
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,250
Anton's blindness indicates damage to both occipital lobes.

160
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,620
Must be from the trauma.

161
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,580
Bullet fragments just happen to hit the same spot in both lobes?

162
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,970
Stroke could cause anton's blindness and euphoria.

163
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,480
Office krupke is clotting in his brain.

164
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,240
Start heparin to thin the blood,find the clot,and yank it out.

165
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,980
Clot would be at the top of the bilateral vertibral arteries.

166
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,480
Great.Chase...stick your fingers in there,grope around till you find it.

167
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,260
Oh,wait...when you turn him into a vegetable,

168
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,430
then there's gonna be frivolous lawsuits.

169
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,420
You know what would be better?Contrast mri.

170
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,790
Do we have one of those?

171
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,150
You can't do an mri.If the bullet fragment's magnetic,

172
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,840
they'll move and rip his brain apart.

173
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,110
Well,let's flip a coin.

174
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,010
Heads,mri;tails,he dies.

175
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,820
The police issue kevlar vests don't have the ceramic plate insert

176
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,680
that would shatter a bullet,they would just catch it.

177
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,940
So the bullet shattered on its own.

178
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,960
Meaning baby shoes was using 0.38 caliber hollow points.

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,330
Which,unfortunately,are ferromagnetic.

180
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,380
It's just so cool that you know that.

181
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,000
We could do an angio to find the clotting.

182
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:57,600
Waste of time.The skull creates too much artifact.We'll never get a decent view.

183
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,090
Next best thing to an mri.--And a waste of time.

184
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,570
Angio might show--oh,god,it's a coup!

185
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,580
Fine!Go do your angio.

186
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,000
When you're do wasting your time,meet me down in the morgue.

187
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,540
we're going to snake a catheter in your femoral artery

188
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,510
and up into your brain so we can check for clots.

189
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,830
Keep this on throughout the procedure.

190
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,710
Unless the pot's already made you sterile.

191
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,750
I have a stressful job.You got no idea.

192
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,340
I grew up with cops like you.

193
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,450
One part bully,nine parts hypocrite.

194
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,060
what is wrong with you?

195
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,470
Just having some fun.

196
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,030
That man is sick and scared.

197
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,080
The man's a crooked cop.

198
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,810
Maybe you should take yourself off the case,foreman.

199
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,940
Don't have to like someone to be their doctor.

200
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,140
Hey,how you doing there,buddy?

201
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,560
Just sit still and we'll have you back out there scaring the crap out of people in no time.

202
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,200
Happy?

203
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,420
What did the angio tell us?

204
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,490
What are you looking for?

205
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,450
I called my mom.She didn't pick up.

206
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,670
What did the angio tell us?

207
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,720
That foreman should be off this case.

208
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,920
he's a neurologist.

209
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,930
Unless you think the patient's optic nerve is in his spleen...

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,380
he doesn't like cops.

211
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,980
foreman,policemen are our friends.

212
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,910
If you and I ever get separated shopping--

213
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,850
I was just busting the guy's chops.

214
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,790
See?--He was just busting the guy's chops.

215
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,300
Foreman is essential to solving this case.

216
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,510
Medically,what did the angio tell us?

217
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,460
Appears to be some clotting,possibly around the circle of willis.

218
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,030
Based on the progression of symptoms,the clot is growing.

219
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,100
We need to cut into--

220
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,630
saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there's a traffic jam ahead.

221
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,550
Is it a 10-car pileup or just a really slow bus in the center lane?

222
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,540
And if it is a bus,is it a thrombotic bus of an embolic bus?

223
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,930
Think I pushed that metaphor too far.

224
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,140
Angio can't tell us that kind of information.

225
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,890
Oh,so you're saying it's just a waste of time.

226
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,740
It gave us some information without killing him.

227
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,570
You don't know that an mri will kill him.

228
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,360
The bullets have a ferrous base!

229
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,230
Little tiny pieces trapped in his head.They're not going anywhere.

230
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,190
maybe it's worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments.

231
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,150
Surgeons say inoperable,or the patient's on blood thinners.

232
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,640
Other than that,perfect planning.

233
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,120
You got a better plan?

234
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,680
Much.

235
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,070
Bullets identical to the one that baby shoes popped joe with.

236
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,990
Let's see how magnetic it is.

237
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,770
Did anybody hear a--

238
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,520
I shot him.He's dead.

239
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,490
the bullet split into four fragments,no exit wounds.

240
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,030
Only used a half load of gunpowder.

241
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,550
We won't be exactly precise comparing the location on an x-ray to an mri.

242
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,300
How unprofessional was foreman?

243
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,410
As him yourself.He's right here.

244
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,520
worse than usual.Better than you.

245
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,120
He berated joe for being a bad cop.

246
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,770
Berated or humiliated?

247
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,930
I'm not sure.I didn't have my thesaurus with me.

248
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,060
One implies that he took pleasure in it.

249
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,170
I wanna know if it was repressed black anger or just giddiness.

250
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,600
You think I'm sick?

251
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,880
I think that an appropriate response

252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,340
to watching your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.

253
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,650
But the fact that I've grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing.

254
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,300
Dr. Foreman,dr. Chase requests your assistance.

255
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,770
I can't even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse.

256
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,810
Well,if I'd shot a live person,there's a lot more paperwork.

257
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,490
Then it won't be a problem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake

258
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,940
and explain why a cancer patient has a bullet hole in his head?

259
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,030
The man donated his body to science.

260
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,350
Yes,it's a tragedy. If I hadn't shot him,his body could have spent the next year

261
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,010
letting first-year med students use the carpool lane.

262
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,850
He's set.

263
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,820
Do not turn that on,house.

264
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,410
You're mad because I put a bullet in his head.

265
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,320
At worst,all I'm doing now is taking it out.

266
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,810
My bad.

267
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,530
They have to,uh,shut down the magnet to fix it.

268
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,670
Mri is gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks.

269
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,510
Well,it doesn't matter.

270
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,540
We obviously can't use it on this patient.

271
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,050
no...but there are other doctors in this hospital,and other patients.

272
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,160
That helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment.

273
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,780
I'm sure i'm pulling my weight.

274
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,190
Is doing nothing an option?

275
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,760
I'm just saying.Maybe the clot will break up on its own.

276
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,410
The giddiness seems to have gone away.

277
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,900
The blindness hasn'T.

278
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,330
Echo his heart.

279
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,650
Looking for what?The problem is obviously neurological.

280
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,220
The clots are in his brain.The source of the clots may not be.

281
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,800
Do a complete transthoratic echocardiogram.

282
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,070
Maybe we get lucky.Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.

283
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,750
heart's clean.

284
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,390
Where else can we look?

285
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,060
We could ultrasound his legs,look for a dvt.

286
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,070
I need you to move over.

287
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,390
Joe?You okay?

288
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,060
Tachycardia.Heart rate 150 and rising.

289
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,500
He's bleeding out.

290
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,530
House wanted to thin his blood.Sure did a good job.

291
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,030
Bp's crashing.He's going into shock.

292
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,190
Intracranial bleeding.We need to relieve the pressure.

293
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,710
We need a surgical team.

294
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,950
Foreman,get out!

295
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,650
boy,is he screwed!

296
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,900
We clot his blood,he dies.We thin it,he dies.

297
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
Am I the only one who finds this funny?

298
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,590
Oh,man.

299
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,640
i'm not sick!

300
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,960
Did you hear the one about the guy who bled into his brain

301
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,100
and had to have a hole drilled in his skull to relieve the pressure?Hilarious!

302
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,370
Someone laughs,they're dying?That's absurd.

303
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,710
But not funny.

304
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,290
If I'm not sick,all you're doing is locking me up with the source.

305
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,660
I'll get sick,prove you right.

306
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,420
If you're not sick,it's not contagious.You've got nothing to worry about.

307
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,470
If you are sick,the two of you are staying in there until we find that why.

308
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,900
So you might want to make friends with the pig.

309
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,380
Good news is I can finally get my mri.

310
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,480
No,you can't!

311
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,350
You blew up the machine!

312
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,280
Not the portable one,chuckles.

313
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,090
Chase and cameron are bringing it to scan your non-bullet-riddled head.

314
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,760
Wh-where are you going?

315
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,200
To the office.Got work to do.

316
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,610
Eat your meals.

317
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,070
Take your temperature every half hour and any meds i command you to take.

318
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,740
So I'm just a regular patient now?

319
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,270
No.

320
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,750
You get your own thermometer.

321
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,030
Check your blood.

322
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,520
Anyone with an elevated sed rate gets to be foreman's new roomie.

323
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,420
He should be a part of this.

324
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,520
He's a patient.

325
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
He's not irrational.--He's not objective.

326
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,680
He's got the most motivation to get this diagnosed.

327
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,600
Right,you're not even friends with him.Why would you care?

328
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,210
There's an area of increased t2 attenuation in the cingulate cortex.

329
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,790
Kind of...mushy.

330
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,900
Cingulate cortex controls emotions.

331
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,270
This mushy spot explains the euphoria.Question is,what's causing the mush?

332
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,060
Question you might want to ask a neurologist.

333
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,100
Foreman is a selfish jerk,but he's a neurologist,

334
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,790
and he's the only one who's been in that apartment.

335
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,580
This is why he shouldn't be here.

336
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,670
You wouldn't call him a jerk if he was here.

337
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,170
If you think he screwed up at that apartnt,you'd keep it to yourself.

338
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,950
No,I--well,we'll never know.

339
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,490
But as long as he's not here,he's just like any other patient.

340
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,910
Which means we can dumpn him all we want.

341
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,450
What's eating the selfish jerk's brain?

342
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,940
West nile or eastern equine encephalitis--test foreman's blood.

343
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,170
Given that he's the only one who got it,

344
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,710
person-to-person transmission is

345
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,950
less likely than some sort of deadly toxin foreman picked up at the guy's home.

346
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,920
Who wants to go next?

347
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,850
You're ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy who doesn't consider you a friend.

348
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,020
He's just a patient,right?It's the job.

349
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,700
Hey...you don't have to go anywhere.

350
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,700
Joe's apartment is right downstairs in the lab.

351
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,110
Foreman brought back samples of everything.

352
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,240
What was that,"who wants to go next?"

353
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,310
Some kind of...test?

354
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,140
Don't worry.You made the right call.

355
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,800
Foreman stumbled into whatever it is without knowing.

356
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,500
He's way smarter than you are.

357
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,570
Damn,chase!

358
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,540
You suck at this.

359
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,580
Sorry,it's this damn suit.

360
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,760
I can do it myself.And I'll throw that out.

361
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,890
What'd the mri show?

362
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,800
I can't be a part of the differential,and I can't even know what the differential is?

363
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,980
You'd tell any other patient what you found out.

364
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,600
Mri showed a lesion on your cingulate cortex.

365
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,520
What's the thinking?

366
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,720
Toxins are in the lead.

367
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,380
Viral's a distant second.

368
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,260
Do you think the lesion could be an abscess?

369
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,340
It's just a small,soft area,more mush than--

370
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,810
was there inflammation in the lining of the ventricles?

371
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,160
There was an increased signal there,yeah.

372
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,480
What are you thinking?

373
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,390
Staph infection.

374
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,730
Toxins lead to neurodegeneration,which causes the lesion.

375
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,910
Not without a fever.

376
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,400
The cop had a fever.

377
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,740
Mine could be coming.I could have got it directly from him,

378
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,600
or a dirty dish towel at his place.

379
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,640
Give us omaya reservoirs. Deliver linezolid directly into our brains.

380
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,880
And we're cured.

381
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,680
samples tested negative for toluene,arsenic,and lead.

382
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,790
what about the blood?

383
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,100
Negative for west nile and eastern equine.

384
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,000
We have to go back to joe's apartment--

385
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,660
no one goes back to that place till we know what we're looking for.

386
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,710
Get some of that cop tape.Stick it over the doors and the windows.

387
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,560
I'll take all the hazmat precautions.The chance of infection is next to nothing.

388
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,800
I was never that great at math.

389
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,960
But next to nothing is...higher than nothing,right?

390
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,600
It's not your fault he got sick.

391
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,640
It would be his fault if we did.

392
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,920
We should get a sample directly from joe's brain.

393
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,130
We can't do a biopsy.

394
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,940
There's too much edema from the bleeding because you gave him heparin.

395
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,200
Well,I don't think this is the time to be pointing fingers.

396
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,940
I didn't give foreman any.

397
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,420
You want to give foreman a brain biopsy?

398
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,980
Come on,really,who doesn't?

399
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:14,010
This could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration.

400
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,080
Without a fever?Not a chance.

401
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,320
Joe had a fever. --He also had legionella.

402
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,380
The mush might be forming an abscess.

403
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,690
And since there was inflammation of the lining of the ventricles,it makes sense.

404
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,350
The staph releases toxins,causes neurodegeneration,causes a lesion.

405
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,530
This is a waste of time.

406
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,930
We should put an omaya reservoir in foreman's brain and start administering anti--

407
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,340
if I'm gonna be arguing with foreman,I may as well do it directly.

408
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,470
Kernig's sign,negative.

409
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,780
Brudzinski's sign,single positive.

410
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,800
Patient joe luria,distal and proximal arm contractures,

411
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,900
duration four seconds.

412
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,190
Staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.

413
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,850
Most commonly?

414
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,410
You wanna treat me like any other patient,do it.

415
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,140
But the house I know never uses phrases like "most commonly."

416
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,990
You're not laughing anymore.

417
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,380
No.

418
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,210
Think that's a good thing?

419
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,450
Sorta doubt it.

420
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,170
Staph would be in your heart,lungs,spleen,liver,or kidneys before it gets to your brain.

421
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,490
Your organs are clear.It's not staph.

422
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,920
The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.

423
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,240
Which I would have seen in your mri.

424
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,800
Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.

425
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,410
Let me see the mri.

426
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,610
There was no abscess on the image.

427
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,100
Let me see it,then.

428
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,690
I liked you better when you were jolly.

429
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,630
Mri was taken over an hour ago.

430
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,230
That soft spot could now be an abscess.

431
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,940
If it was staph,you'd have a fever.Which you don't!

432
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,320
101.6.

433
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,680
What idiot gave you that?

434
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:32,380
Put the omaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph.

435
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,160
triangle.

436
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,920
this one?

437
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,720
Uh...circle.

438
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,090
Next.

439
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,950
Foreman,why aren't you answering?Is there a problem?

440
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,330
Uh,s-square.

441
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,950
tell me your date of birth.

442
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,510
Is that house?--yeah. Next.

443
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,390
A square again.Why is he here?

444
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,210
Because my neurologist is having surgery.

445
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,000
Thought I was just another patient.

446
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,900
You didn't believe that crap,did you?

447
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,150
Date of birth.

448
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,820
The omaya reservoir is inserted in the parietal lobe.

449
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,310
My spatial recognition is the issue,not my memory.

450
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,420
Did you say omaya?

451
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,120
I could have sworn you said biopsy.

452
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,330
Hey,I'm just messing with your head.

453
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,380
Mother's maiden name,please.

454
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,920
Get out of my temporal lobe,house.

455
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,500
Hello?

456
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,030
Are you awake?

457
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:47,610
They told me somebody was sick like me.

458
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,550
I'm up.

459
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,240
Your voice...

460
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,320
aren't you my doctor?

461
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,600
Not anymore.

462
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,500
You're the guy who doesn't like cops.

463
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,400
Yeah.

464
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,170
Can you see?

465
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,570
You can't?

466
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,700
Not a thing.

467
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,010
You've been blind a while.

468
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,950
The fact that you're aware of it now...

469
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,540
it could be a sign of improvement.

470
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,890
It hurts so much.Doesn't it?

471
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,300
I'm okay.

472
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,880
It's gonna hurt.

473
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,380
The morphine barely takes the edge off.

474
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,340
I'm gonna die,aren't I?

475
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,750
You die,I die.It's not gonna happen.

476
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,750
Why not?

477
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,360
You're just too stubborn to die?

478
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,200
They took a piece of my brain.

479
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,780
Whatever's wrong with us...they'll find.

480
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,410
Do you believe in prayer?

481
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,230
Not really.

482
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,130
Neither do I.

483
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,150
My dad always prays.

484
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,480
So does mine.

485
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,070
Do you wanna try it?

486
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,830
Try prayin'?

487
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,860
Okay.

488
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,730
How is he?

489
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,630
Still dying.

490
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,380
Well,you've almost mastered another skill,though.That's good.

491
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,520
Foreman's biopsy results.

492
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,080
Non-specific signs of inflammation.

493
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,100
That's it?

494
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,260
We also swabbed for staph.Negative.He's not even a carrier.

495
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,680
Well,at least foreman was wrong too.

496
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,380
Yeah,there's that.

497
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,820
Can I go to joe's apartment now?

498
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,190
No.

499
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,530
Go back to the lab.

500
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,420
Start retesting all the samples that foreman collected.

501
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,330
For what?

502
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,470
Everything.

503
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,170
Bacteria,toxins,fungus.Anything that likes to feast on brain.

504
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,730
That's thousands of--

505
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,060
better hurry.

506
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,750
Cameron,suit up.You're gonna monitor foreman.

507
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:03,750
He's on to hand contractures.He'll be in anton's blindness soon.

508
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,390
Run hourly checks,because when he does go blind,he won't be able to tell us.

509
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,220
We'll use the data to construct a timeline so we can see how far behind joe he is.

510
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,950
Why are you still here?

511
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,610
You're being cautious.

512
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,290
You're being...common.

513
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,020
When you don't give a crap about--

514
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,740
how many of your guys have caught cancer from their patients?

515
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:40,400
Let me know when that happens.Then we can have this conversation.

516
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,680
It's just another case,huh?

517
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,720
Gee,I bet you can even have unprotected sex

518
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,540
with your cancer patients without catching a damn thing.

519
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,780
Boy,I wish I had your job.

520
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,060
Biopsy showed nothing.

521
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,290
How can there be nothing?You cut out a piece of my brain.

522
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,130
It's nothing personal.We just didn't find anything.

523
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,370
Can you up his morphine for god's sake?

524
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,500
He's already maxed out,20 milligrams per hour.

525
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,020
What about toxins?

526
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,190
Everything was negative.

527
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,360
There was a cupboard above the stove.Did you see it?

528
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,400
I didn't check all the food,but could be listeriosis.

529
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,080
We didn't go back.Follow right.

530
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,130
Who did?

531
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,410
House said we shouldn't go.Too dangerous.

532
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,340
The answer's gotta be in that apartment.Not going is too dangerous!

533
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,290
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,210
You're thankful.

535
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:40,720
If house would have pointed at you instead of me,you'd be the one in here.

536
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,540
Look straight forward,tell me when you can see--

537
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,900
it's your job to go back!You're a doctor!You go where the disease is!

538
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,710
Say when you can see the light.

539
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,110
I'm dying,and you're sitting here measuring how fast I go?

540
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,520
Tell me when you can see the light!

541
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,270
My vision's fine!

542
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,020
Your left-side periphery is reduced.

543
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,010
It's fine,I'll prove it.

544
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,070
Ow! Son of a bitch!

545
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,760
Now we're both exposed.

546
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,920
You got two choices.

547
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,490
You can go tell house what just happened and get your own cot board in here,

548
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,660
or you can go back to that apartment...

549
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,020
you save me,the cop,and yourself.

550
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:25,190
it's not sspe.I checked your past vaccinations against joe'S.No batch matches.

551
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,980
Blood show antibodies for coxsackievirus?

552
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,480
Guys,could you please shut him up?

553
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,720
He's over his limit on morphine.

554
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,860
Where's cameron?

555
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,570
She said she has some stuff to do.Said she'd be back soon.

556
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,920
what are you doing?

557
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,220
Foreman!

558
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,200
Stop!I can't take it!

559
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:09,640
Imagine being constantly reminded of the...pain you're about to be in.

560
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,410
I can't take it!Stop it! Stop it!Stop it,stop it.

561
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,710
Mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!

562
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,970
So could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy.

563
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,110
Either the morphine kills him or the pain does. --You're condoning this?!

564
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.

565
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,470
That'll make you feel better.

566
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:56,580
Joe has a new symptom.Hyperalgesia.

567
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,360
The infection's spreading to the pain center of the brain.

568
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,560
Make it stop!Make it stop!

569
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,240
His brain's telling him that his whole body's in pain,

570
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,270
and because of the location,the painkillers do nothing.

571
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,160
Suit up.Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.

572
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,760
What if he used cedarwood to hide the pot smell?

573
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,620
Aureobasidium fungus could grow there.

574
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,430
Did you find any cedarwood anywhere?

575
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,980
No,but maybe--maybe what?

576
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,420
Maybe somebody could go back,take a second look?

577
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,390
And why aren't you pissed off that cameron's playing hooky

578
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,930
while your life hangs in the balance?

579
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,620
Why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?

580
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,850
I decided you were wrong.

581
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,220
God,you're weak.

582
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,160
Guy steals your article...

583
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,550
tells you you're not his friend...

584
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,560
and you still want to risk your life for him.

585
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,040
Foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.

586
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,240
Yeah.

587
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,670
God,you're weak.Guy tried to kill you.

588
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,910
First thing on my list of things to do would be to stab him back.Shoot him.

589
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,980
I've got a gun in my desk.

590
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,130
Last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it

591
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,360
and then give the bastard everything he wanted.

592
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,530
I'm not here for foreman.I'm here to save myself.

593
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:25,010
even with a needle stick,your chances of infection are pretty slim.

594
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,060
That's why you're wearing the suit.

595
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,040
You wanted to be here.

596
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,860
He just gave you the excuse.

597
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:36,960
What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?

598
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,120
Give me the bag.

599
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,180
Mildewed dish towel.--To retest for staph.

600
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,650
What is that,mouse droppings?

601
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,010
Hamster droppings.Could carry toxocara.Explain the blindness.

602
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,620
Now,that I recognize as oven crud.

603
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,130
Could be meat with trichinella.Would explain the high fever.

604
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,180
What's with rye bread?

605
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:20,860
Mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning,which would explain the contractures.

606
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,240
There are three loaves.--So?

607
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,780
You're going back in there.

608
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,280
Guy who lives on take-out pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.

609
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,480
That's looking too far into the future.

610
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,210
Unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.

611
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,530
You on the roof yet?

612
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,210
Yeah,I'm here. I don't see any birds.

613
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,270
Whistle or something.

614
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,870
Do that come hither thing.

615
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,190
they came that fast because it's their behavior pattern.

616
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,690
Joe's been feeding them.

617
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,390
Now look down.You see a river of pigeon turd?

618
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,890
Uh...no.There's barely any.

619
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,910
It's not weird,it's cheap.

620
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,240
Joe's a guy whlooks for the easy way.

621
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,790
Probably been stealing cable from his neighbors.

622
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,600
Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings?

623
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,110
You see a shovel or a dustpan?

624
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,620
Mmm,found a scraper.Looks used.

625
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,980
Sitting on a bucket.

626
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:37,750
Bucket full of pigeon crap.Perfect home for cryptococcus neoformans.

627
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,610
Yep.

628
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,530
Fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus,

629
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:47,240
where it dances its triple threat of happiness,blindness,and intractable pain.

630
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,010
Let's hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson.

631
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:54,220
Don't cut corners when you're growing your pot.See you back home.

632
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,720
I was there.

633
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,660
I should have found it.

634
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,000
Yeah,you could have saved us a lot of time.

635
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,380
Get me a flush of ampho b and flucytosine.

636
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,340
I'll start us both.

637
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,570
I was waiting for lab confirmation.Haven't heard from house yet.

638
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,730
Look at his eeg.

639
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,180
Theta band's been increasing steadily since--since we put him under.

640
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,750
Guy's unconscious,but still in pain.

641
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,870
Theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.

642
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,410
One of which is pain.

643
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:28,000
The fact that he's no longer screaming makes us feel better,not necessarily him.

644
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,990
Chase!How's cameron?

645
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,940
She's not giddy.

646
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:52,000
Fever's down.White count's improving.

647
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,130
Has she said anything to you?

648
00:40:54,170 --> 00:41:00,630
You mean like,"I completely understand why foreman did what he did,and I hold no grudge?"

649
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,480
What I did...did save my life.

650
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,410
Get in here and help!Forget the suit!

651
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:21,980
He's tachycardic!Wide-complex looks like v-tach!

652
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,380
It's not cryptococcus!

653
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,430
What?--House was wrong.The samples were negative.

654
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,130
So what is it?

655
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,650
We don't know!--Give him in the amio.

656
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,100
Do we have any more leads?

657
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,920
that was our lead!Foreman!

658
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,640
So the treatment isn't doing anything.

659
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,000
Foreman!He's in v-fib!

660
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,090
No good.Hit him again.

661
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,040
Come on,man.Come on,joe.

662
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,340
Hit him again!

663
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,960
give him an amp of epi!

664
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,500
Nothing!

665
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,970
He's has multiple-system failure.

666
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,390
Foreman.

667
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,600
Come on,joe.

668
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,440
Foreman.

669
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,330
foreman!Time of death.

670
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,030
No.

671
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,070
Time of death.

672
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,380
12:26 pm.
