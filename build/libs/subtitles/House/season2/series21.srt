1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,820
You high, popo?

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,040
A cop with a sense of humor. 
You can check the cop car.

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,750
Also check his personal car, work, home.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,200
Foreman, get out!

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,580
Am I the only one who finds this funny?

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,770
You stole my article.

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,770
I wouldn't do that.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,680
We're not friends, we're colleagues.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,390
Ow! Son of a bitch!

10
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,650
Now we're both exposed.

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,890
I'm gonna die.

12
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,130
You die, I die. It's not gonna happen.

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,920
Time of death, 12:26 P.M.

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,640
I need a bone saw.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,080
- I'm sorry. I wish I could. 
- You said you

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,230
I just want a little tiny slice of
this guy's brain, that's all I need.

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,330
Just enough to tell me 
what's killing Foreman.

18
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,820
A thin slice of Joe's brain could 
also cause a public health crisis.

19
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,170
It's not a good idea to scream "fire"
every time somebody lights a match.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,600
Don't downplay this, House.

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,380
You put both of them 
in isolation for a reason.

22
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,690
Joe's death elevates this 
situation to a biosafety level three.

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,950
Ooh, level three.

24
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,670
You should call Jack Bauer.

25
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,590
I called the CDC.

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,450
Well, tell them 
I'll be really, really careful.

27
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,350
We don't have the proper equipment 
for you to be really, really careful.

28
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,270
You can do whatever you want to
Foreman, but the CDC will do this autopsy.

29
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,200
Whatever. The point is, we'll be 
lucky to get results in three days.

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,800
I told them how urgent this is.

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,690
And they told you?

32
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,520
We'll have the results in three days.

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,780
Aw, that's a shame.

34
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,580
Because Foreman will never get to know 
what it was. He'll be dead in 36 hours.

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,550
Maybe this is a toxin.
Maybe it's not contagious at all,

36
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,870
and you're killing Foreman 
because of a maybe.

37
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,380
Well, you have 36 hours 
to figure out which one it is.

38
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,780
Foreman. Come here, fast.

39
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,030
What's going on?

40
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,910
When are they doing the autopsy?

41
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,120
You're doing it. Now.

42
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,860
You ever study how they used 
to do ice pick lobotomies?

43
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,410
I read about it in 
med school. Why would I--

44
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,220
shove an ice pick into the eye 
socket. Just above the tear duct.

45
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,420
Bang it a couple of times with 
a hammer, get a sample.

46
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,380
What's going on, man?

47
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,440
Foreman, you can't do it.

48
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,120
You'll be in violation of--

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,590
- Can't do the time if you're not alive.
- You.

50
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,960
I need you to suit up.

51
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,860
Get that equipment away 
from Dr. Foreman.

52
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,210
Take your time, guys.

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,210
Why don't you just tell him 
to go slow? Won't be your fault.

54
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,600
Foreman.

55
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,420
We don't even know what kind 
of contagion we're dealing with.

56
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,540
Which is why we need 
to chop into the guy's head.

57
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,480
- It's dangerous.
- Not to you, Foreman.

58
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,080
There are other ways 
to diagnose you.

59
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,330
Yeah? You have the answer?

60
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,760
Foreman, do it now.

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,720
I am warning you, do not--

62
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,980
What are you doing?

63
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,060
That didn't feel right.

64
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,250
He's blind.

65
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,450
He thinks he can see. 
Same as the cop.

66
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,090
I need something 
to bag the sample.

67
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,640
Forget it. You just 
biopsied a mattress.

68
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,630
No,no,no.I'm fine.

69
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,530
House, there's the sample.
Get it, test it.

70
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,440
You gotta test that sample!

71
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,000
Apparently I was 
optimistic about the 36 hours.

72
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,840
Intractable, unbearable 
pain is up next.

73
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,440
Sure you don't want to reconsider 
that whole autopsy thing?

76
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:32,899
-=House=-
Season 2 Episode 21

77
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:37,450
Physically, his eyes are fine.

78
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,870
Problem's isolated to his brain.

79
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,520
Damage to the occipital lobe extends
from the primary visual cortex--

80
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,460
Should we test him for 
bacterial meningitis?

81
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,370
If it was meningitis,
we'd all be sick.

82
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,030
- His CSF could show signs
- That would be pointless.

83
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,120
We already did a brain biopsy.
It was negative.

84
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,920
Toxic mold?

85
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,100
If it was toxic mold, I'd be sick.

86
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,970
How do we know you're not sick?

87
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,420
Do I seem happy to you?

88
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,910
Never.

89
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,450
It was funny.

90
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,280
Well, let's assume 
it's not blood-borne.

91
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,820
If you start cracking jokes, 
we can re-assess.

92
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,830
In the meantime, stay away from 
people and animals that you care about.

93
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,800
Guillian-Barre?

94
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,170
Neither of them had any sort of paralysis.

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,830
Joe could have died before the 
paralysis had a chance to present.

96
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,150
**What about arbovirus?

97
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,870
Start treatment.

98
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,070
For Arbovirus?

99
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,370
You think our Jersey beat cop

100
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,940
has been spending a lot of 
time exploring deep, dark Africa?

101
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,160
Treatment for everything.

102
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,020
Likely or unlikely. If you 
can think of it, treat for it.

103
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,290
Mixing that many meds will 
create all sorts of toxic interactions.

104
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,530
We'll box his liver, trash his kidneys.
There's got to be a better way.

105
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,090
Of course there's a better way!

106
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,910
It's that body sitting in the room 
with him that Cuddy won't let us touch.

107
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,400
Bacterials, virals, toxins, fungals, 
parasites. It's got to be one of them.

108
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,310
Where are you going?

109
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,450
To see if I can find 
another brain to biopsy.

110
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,640
We're going to lock Joe up
downstairs until the CDC gets here.

111
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,690
Foreman, you can't see.

112
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,160
Right.

113
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,160
House wants to start you on 
some meds. They're in the airlock.

114
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,270
For what?

115
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,550
Leading candidate is toxic mold.

116
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,870
Is Cameron sick?

117
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,220
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

118
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,140
You're casting your net a little 
wider than toxic mold, aren't you?

119
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,740
Guillian-Barre is also on the table.

120
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,680
This is an oval shape...
has either an L or a 7.

121
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,670
I'm guessing an L. Levofloxacin, 
because you can't rule out bacteria.

122
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,280
Eight, zero, zero. That's the dosage 
for the acylovir in case it's viral.

123
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,320
Square...no,
more like a rhombus.

124
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,070
That's fluconazole for fungus.

125
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,570
There's about eight 
others here. You--

126
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,850
You're treating me for everything.

127
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,510
You have no idea what I've got.

128
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,170
House thinks this is 
the best course of action.

129
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,440
House is desperate.

130
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,850
House is never desperate.

131
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,420
Something we give you will work.

132
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,930
Yeah, we should start 
treating all patients this way.

133
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,950
When they get sick,
they just take everything.

134
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,460
It's better than doing nothing.

135
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,950
Hello?

136
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,970
I'm at the cop's place.

137
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,730
I need to retrace your steps.

138
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,350
You don't think the "treat him for 
everything" approach is enough?

139
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,100
Where did you start your search?

140
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,070
The kitchen.

141
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,620
You will tell me everything 
you did, everything you touched.

142
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,980
If you went to the john, 
I want to know when and why.

143
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,600
I started with samples 
from the mold in his sink.

144
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,000
What next?

145
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,860
That's it. Then I left.

146
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,500
What do we do now?

147
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,630
Wait for Steve McQueen
to get giddy.

148
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,020
Excellent plan.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,050
Hey, dad.

150
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,320
It's Eric. I'm not
doing too good.

151
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,370
How's Foreman?

152
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,400
You're accessing a webcam?

153
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,100
Cuddy's shower.

154
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,790
Are you a fan of the Brazilian? I--

155
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,770
Is that your kitchen?

156
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,620
Well, obviously I 
couldn't bring him here.

157
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,340
He's been exposed to 
whatever Foreman's got.

158
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,900
You infected Steve?

159
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,580
Why didn't you just get 
a rat from the pet store?

160
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,100
Because...I needed one 
with a clean medical history.

161
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,490
Who knows what kind of 
antibiotics they give those rats?

162
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,190
So this is your plan? Just sit 
here and watch your rat all day?

163
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,900
Well, it shouldn't take long.

164
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,470
Got the AC blasting, 
I soaked the floor of his cage...

165
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,380
as soon as he gets sick, 
I do an autopsy.

166
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,600
As soon as he's dead.

167
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,440
Right after he gets sick, there's a good 
chance he'll get hit in the head with a...

168
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,680
cane-shaped object.

169
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,720
Normally you just use 
your patients as lab rats.

170
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,310
It's a nice change.

171
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,490
First symptom is euphoria.

172
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,350
How do you know if a rat's euphoric?

173
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,500
He doesn't usually climb on his 
water bottle like that, does he?

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,220
the seizures only seem to happen 
when she's in her car seat.

175
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,520
She starts to rock and grunt.

176
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,620
She responsive?

177
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,750
No, no, it's like she's in a zone.

178
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,130
And her abdominal 
muscles become dystonic.

179
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,950
Big word.

180
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,760
Someone's been on the interweb.

181
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,140
I looked up a few articles on epilepsy.

182
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,340
You know, there's actually some 
really great youth soccer leagues,

183
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,890
that would cater specifically 
to her special needs,and...

184
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,910
I think it might explain why she's 
been having a hard time in preschool.

185
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,090
Let's confirm your diagnosis 
before you have her held back.

186
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,430
Strobing lights and high-pitched 
sounds can provoke a seizure.

187
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,090
You're a goof.

188
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
Takes one to know one, loser.

189
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,030
Wait, that means I'm a loser.
Scratch that.

190
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,610
These episodes.
She get sweaty afterwards?

191
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,850
Soaking wet.

192
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,420
And does she seem 
upset by them, or just tired?

193
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,030
No, she kind of thinks it's funny.

194
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,220
You mix rocking, grunting, sweating, 
and dystonia with concerned parents,

195
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,120
and you get an amateur 
diagnosis of epilepsy.

196
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:57,570
In actuality, all your little girl is doing 
is saying "yoo hoo" to the "hoo hoo".

197
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,780
She's what?

198
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,990
Marching the penguin.

199
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,310
Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood.

200
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,510
Finding Nemo.

201
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,730
That was funny.

202
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,080
It's called gratification disorder.
Sort of a misnomer.

203
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,890
If one was unable to gratify oneself,
that would be a disorder.

204
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,760
Are you saying she's masturbating?

205
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,470
I was trying to be discreet.
There's a child in the room.

206
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,620
Oh, this is horrifying.

207
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,030
Epilepsy is horrifying.

208
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,830
Teach your girl about privacy 
and she'll be fine. Here you go.

209
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,280
Thank you.

210
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,610
One afternoon, and you're on pace to set 
the record for most patients seen in a month.

211
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,860
You're upset that I'm doing clinic hours?

212
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,760
Wow, that is so like 
rain on your wedding day.

213
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,730
For the past three hours, I have been on 
the phone with the CDC, while you are--

214
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,250
Yeah, how's that going, 
by the way?

215
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,600
They promised to expedite--

216
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,520
Tough to do an autopsy when they 
haven't even picked up the body.

217
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,110
It's tough to treat your patient when 
you're not even on the same floor.

218
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,450
Go. Clinic is covered.

219
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,320
I go watch the meds drip into his IV,

220
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,930
you think that'll make the 
treatment work faster?

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,680
Go to your office. 
Play with your ball.

222
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,940
Write on your whiteboard.
Insult your team.

223
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,790
Do whatever it is that you do 
to figure things out.

224
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,670
Feeling guilty?

225
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,380
It's not too late to change 
your mind. Go call the CDC.

226
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,380
Tell 'em you were just joshing.

227
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,630
Keep avoiding Foreman's 
ase until he dies.

228
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,770
Then I'll drown in guilt.

229
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,610
Feeling any better?

230
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,760
How are you doing?

231
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,330
I'm not the patient.

232
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,610
Is your sed rate elevated?

233
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,090
No.

234
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,750
So far,it looks like I lucked out.

235
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,490
Cameron.

236
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,830
Looks like you left 
a tourniquet on the bed.

237
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,340
You can see again?

238
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,500
The treatment's working.

239
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,860
The question is, which treatment?

240
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,750
We'll start weaning him off one at a 
time. Which one do we start with?

241
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,260
I don't care if you do it alphabetically.
Just stay on top of his vision.

242
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,960
First sign of regression means 
we've taken him off the wrong one.

243
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
The latest blood work.

244
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,290
Foreman's amylase and lipase 
levels are three times normal.

245
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,420
Pancreas is failing.

246
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,940
A toxic side effect of his meds.

247
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,100
Philosophical question.

248
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,060
How do you want to die?

249
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,680
Old age.

250
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,310
Your choice is currently between 4 hours 
from now and 14 hours from now.

251
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,360
So I'm assuming that 
means you want the latter.

252
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
The cocktail's working.

253
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,850
My vision's almost 
completely restored.

254
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,750
The meds are curing 
what's in your head,

255
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,510
but they're trashing your pancreas.

256
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,360
That's why you're puking and 
you can't stand up without screaming.

257
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,680
So lower the dosages.

258
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,860
Less stress on my pancreas, 
still battle the infection.

259
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,660
Lower dosages will still be toxic.

260
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,930
I don't care!

261
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,660
I can handle the pain 
of the pancreatitis.

262
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,810
I don't think you can handle 
life without a pancreas.

263
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,110
We keep you on these meds,

264
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,980
you'll spend the last four hours 
of your life being able to see.

265
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,490
Take you off, you'll go blind again.

266
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,500
But it'll give us time to figure 
out what's eating your brain.

267
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,270
Fine.

268
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,300
What do we do next?

269
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,990
Eric?

270
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,820
Dad?

271
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,130
Yeah, you two can 
get caught up later.

272
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,010
Sir, I need you to come with me.

273
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,510
House.

274
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,030
Uh...what is this?

275
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,690
He isn't a what, he's a who.

276
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,690
They even have the right to vote now.

277
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,480
Rodney Foreman, Cuddy. 
Cuddy, Rodney Foreman.

278
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,280
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

279
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,560
This is Foreman's dad.

280
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,120
Yeah, I got that.

281
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,250
And Dr. Cuddy, here, is 
the Dean of Medicine.

282
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,050
Remember that cool autopsy 
I was telling you about,

283
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,230
the one that would 
save your son's life?

284
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,900
She's the one can give 
us the green light to do it.

285
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,390
I understand you don't
want them to do it.

286
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,460
Dr. House didn't 
seem to know why.

287
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,910
Mr. Foreman, I am doing 
everything I can to get the CDC--

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,990
Won't be soon enough.

289
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,350
And my decision to follow 
public health safety protocols

290
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,350
Oh, don't blame the rules.

291
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,070
Don't want to hang this 
on policy and protocol.

292
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,300
I'm well aware that it may cost your 
son his life, just as I am well aware

293
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,500
that my decision has a devastating 
effect on family and friends

294
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,050
Without having them 
paraded in front of me.

295
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:39,430
Your son has an unknown, 
contagious, deadly infection.

296
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,020
If we don't contain it here, even 
more people could be at risk.

297
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,480
And I am capable of empathizing 
with those people too

298
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,290
without having them 
paraded in front of me.

299
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,460
I understand.

300
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,410
What's wrong with your hand?

301
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,340
It's--it's called a muscle contraction.

302
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,930
I thought this thing was in your brain.

303
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,240
It is. It just means the infection's 
moved to the primary motor cortex,

304
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,350
which controls the muscles.

305
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,690
Aren't you glad you sent 
me to med school?

306
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,150
Does it hurt?

307
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,640
No.

308
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,970
Is it gonna?

309
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,200
The--the other guy...

310
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,900
he didn't seem to 
suffer too much, he--

311
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,660
just went in his sleep.

312
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,000
Steve still acting normal?
No sign of contractures.

313
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,390
They got the cop's body 
in a locked,airtight bag.

314
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,710
And a guard on the door.

315
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,980
These feds are 
seriously paranoid.

316
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,910
He hasn't gotten up 
to pee in hours. He's due.

317
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,340
You haven't sprinkled 
senokot granules on his doughnut?

318
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,060
His bowels would 
open up like the Red Sea.

319
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,680
He wouldn't eat the doughnut.

320
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,360
Have you seriously been 
down here for hours?

321
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,410
No.

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,830
I had to pee a couple times.

323
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,180
You've got to stop 
blaming Cuddy for this.

324
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,360
Given that it is her fault,
that seems appropriate.

325
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,670
That part is her fault.

326
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,020
The part where somebody 
wasted his time in the basement,

327
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,950
plotting the overthrow of a 
government agency, that one's on you.

328
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,090
The only think I can do is think.
I can pretty much do that anywhere.

329
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,670
As long as no one's bugging me.

330
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,020
Did you call your brother?

331
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,490
No.

332
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,300
Did you?

333
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,820
No.

334
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,320
It's not a big deal.

335
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,440
I sure would have liked
to see Mom, though.

336
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,720
You know she 
can't travel anymore.

337
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,360
You tell her?

338
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,890
Why?

339
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,800
Just upset her for a while.

340
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,330
Then she wouldn't 
remember for a while.

341
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,060
Think she should know?

342
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,050
She's lost a lot of who she was.

343
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,320
She can't deal 
with something like this.

344
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,390
And you can?

345
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,810
I still know you're 
going to a better place.

346
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,280
It's easy for you, isn't it?

347
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:11,680
As long as you believe I'm going 
to a better place, dying ain't so bad.

348
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,490
I don't want you to be afraid.

349
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,240
If I'm not afraid of dying, what the 
hell should I be afraid of, Dad?

350
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,630
I thought you believed.

351
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,630
I did.

352
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm not so sure anymore.

353
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,560
I'm going to pray for you, son.

354
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,180
I suggest you do the same.

355
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,500
Field of vision is regressing.

356
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,600
And he's reached an 
eight on the pain scale.

357
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,370
The disease pattern is following 
the exact course as Joe's.

358
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,430
Only it's moving 
much faster in Foreman.

359
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,490
Good! It's an anomaly.

360
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,470
Anomalies tell us things. Why is this 
moving faster in Foreman? What's different?

361
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,290
Could be a different 
strain of the same disease?

362
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,110
Right--we were wasting all this 
time looking for an unknown disease.

363
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,820
We should have been looking for a 
different strain of an unknown disease.

364
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,880
Joe's a cop.

365
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,250
He's into physical fitness,
he could have had...

366
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,160
a more powerful immune system, 
stronger metabolism.

367
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,620
Foreman's black.

368
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,880
What?

369
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,890
How long have you been 
sitting on this information?

370
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,350
Lupus, gout, glaucoma, 
osteoarthritis, hypertension, diabetes,

371
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,040
stop me any time, they all affect 
black people more than whites.

372
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,220
Check everything.

373
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,190
Bacterials, fungals, 
toxins, parasites.

374
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,440
Look for anything with a 
documented racial disparity.

375
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,510
Wait.

376
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,620
The rat's showing symptoms?

377
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,990
No.

378
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,080
He's completely healthy.

379
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,750
Maybe that's the difference 
between Foreman and the cop.

380
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,150
How are you feeling?

381
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,990
Why are you here?

382
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,360
Because you're a friend. 
And I should be here.

383
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,450
I'm sorry House used my 
dad to try and manipulate you.

384
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,330
You've got integrity, you aren't 
going to change your mind

385
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,720
just because you're 
confronted by my father.

386
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,940
Thank you.

387
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,450
Just like I'm not 
going to forgive you

388
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,300
just because you come 
by here and ask how I'm feeling.

389
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,170
You know I've had no choice.

390
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,960
Of course you had a choice!

391
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,710
Regulations are clear.

392
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,550
And the punishment for 
violating those regulations!

393
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,630
Is it death?

394
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:26,370
Because frankly, I'm okay if 
you get a fine, a suspension--

395
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,790
hell, you can spend a couple 
of years in jail if it saves my life!

396
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,930
You're dying too fast.

397
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,040
Couldn't agree more.

398
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,230
Hey, Cuddy.

399
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,080
Having a nice visit?

400
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,280
What's that?

401
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,750
Legionel--legionella pneumophila.

402
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,950
And why are you carrying 
a vial of it around with you?

403
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,880
Foreman was perfectly 
healthy before he got this infection.

404
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,770
Our cop wasn't.
He had legionnaire's disease.

405
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,970
Our cop didn't turn into brain 
food until we cured the legionella.

406
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,700
Legionella slowed down the disease.

407
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,350
Why would that happen?

408
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,100
No idea.I just know that it did.

409
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,880
So you want to infect Foreman?

410
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,370
Gonna tattle to the CDC?

411
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,850
Meds can't help me, 
but a disease can?

412
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,610
Forget it! Just take the pain 
away and put me under.

413
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,970
If I put you under, 
I can't monitor your pain.

414
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,510
If I can't monitor your pain,
I won't know if the legionella's working.

415
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,730
I'm not consenting to you giving me--

416
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,090
What was that?

417
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,200
I wish there could have been 
a puff of smoke or something.

418
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,930
Would've been 
much more dramatic.

419
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,740
Keep your slippers on.

420
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,430
Wouldn't want 
you to cut your foot.

421
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,630
Do you feel any better?

422
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,290
I can't breathe. I'm dizzy.

423
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,160
And I can barely hear anything over 
the sounds of my lungs crackling.

424
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,960
That's the legionella.

425
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,580
You figure that out 
from the symptoms,

426
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,170
or from the vial of stuff 
tossed in my room?

427
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,040
I'm trying to be professional here.
There's no reason to be nasty.

428
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,760
- I'm in pain.
- So is House.

429
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,830
And he's a delight.

430
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,040
He doesn't try to kill his colleagues.

431
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,460
You can remove the thermometer now.

432
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,720
It's down almost a whole degree.

433
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,980
How's the pain?

434
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,230
Great.

435
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,890
This is the good kind.

436
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,250
How bad is it 
compared to an hour ago?

437
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,180
No worse.

438
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,130
The legionella helping?

439
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,250
Yeah.

440
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,750
Good.--Not great.

441
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,010
Didn't fix anything, 
it just slowed it down.

442
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,680
The point was to give Steve a 
little more time to get sick.

443
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,210
What are you going to 
do if he never gets sick?

444
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,040
Brilliant.

445
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,340
Cameron,what type of illnesses 
affect humans, but not rats?

446
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,880
Why are you asking me that?

447
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,550
Because I'm sure that you spent the first 
12 years of your life dreaming of being a vet.

448
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,960
The rat is not getting sick.
Cameron is not getting sick.

449
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,820
Sorry.

450
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,280
It's okay, it's not your fault.

451
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,010
Presumably, you're still healthy because
whatever it is, is not bloodborne.

452
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,650
Steve has no excuse. He did 
everything that Foreman did.

453
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,940
Some bacterial infections
don't infect rats.

454
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,030
Foreman tested negative for every bacterial 
infection that would affect his brain.

455
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,440
And what infections could he be 
positive for, but test negative for?

456
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,750
When we test for infections, 
we look for antibodies.

457
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,910
But what if the patient is infected,
but has no antibodies?

458
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,040
What if the body is not 
fighting the infection?

459
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,110
Why would--

460
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,820
I asked first.

461
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,950
Let's start with the what.
We'll deal with the why later.

462
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,080
If the body doesn't recognize the infection,
our tests come back negative,

463
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,280
and the disease rampages 
through the body unstopped.

464
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,790
Exactly like the cop and 
exactly like Foreman.

465
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,950
And what if the patient was then 
exposed to a second infection?

466
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,330
Like legionella?

467
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,970
The body would recognize that 
infection, increase the white count,

468
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,480
send in the troops to start fighting,

469
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,160
and the initial infection would 
get caught in the crossfire.

470
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,250
So the question becomes,

471
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,300
what type of bacterial infection 
affects humans but not rats,

472
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,480
and the human body would 
be unlikely to recognize?

473
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,230
The answer is Listeria.

474
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,060
I'm starting you on Apogen.

475
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,710
So you're basing this theory 
on the test being negative

476
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,220
and your rat being healthy?

477
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,280
And the fact that 
Legionnaire's is helping you.

478
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,640
But the medicine you want
to give me will put an end to that.

479
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,820
Yeah.

480
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,200
And if it's not Listeria, all the Apogen 
will do is cure the Legionnaire's Disease

481
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,980
and put whatever is killing 
me back into overdrive.

482
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,070
Stop asking me questions based 
on the premise that I'm wrong.

483
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,860
The antibiotics are in the airlock.

484
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,750
I think the first biopsy
didn't give us the answer

485
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,480
because you didn't go deep enough.

486
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,850
I want you to do a 
white matter brain biopsy.

487
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,820
Absolutely.
Don't blame you.

488
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,260
The world is such a complicated place 
if you've got higher reasoning skills.

489
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,300
I'm often jealous of small 
animals and retarded children.

490
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,390
Take the antibiotics.

491
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,990
There can be minimal 
damage if it's done right.

492
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,670
If the surgeons drill where 
I tell them to drill.

493
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,820
One slip--you could spend the rest of your life not 
being able to keep your drool in your mouth.

494
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,620
I'd rather be disabled than dead.

495
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,050
Sure, I make it look oh so sexy.

496
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,140
It's actually not as 
glamorous as you might think.

497
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,150
The biopsy will tell us 
for sure what's wrong.

498
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,210
The antibiotics could 
do the same thing.

499
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,580
Could, not will.

500
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,870
We try it, we see.

501
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,050
The antibiotics will bring back the pain.

502
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,190
Pain makes us 
make bad decisions.

503
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,580
Fear of pain...is almost 
as big a motivator.

504
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,670
Look,we still have time.

505
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,460
I will do that biopsy if I have to.

506
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,060
But not a moment before.

507
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,590
Start Foreman on IV antibiotics. 
Where's his dad?

508
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,670
Where are you supposed to 
be when your son is dying?

509
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,540
He's not with him.

510
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,720
He's in the chapel.

511
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,640
I started your son on 
a new course of treatment.

512
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,070
If it works, he'll get better.

513
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,140
If it doesn't, he won't.

514
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,890
While he's not getting better,

515
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,510
he's going to experience 
so much pain

516
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,590
that we'll have to put him 
in a chemically-induced coma

517
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,640
while we figure out what to do next.

518
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,300
My son says you're 
a manipulative bastard.

519
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,860
It's a pet name.

520
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,210
I call him Dr. Bling.

521
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,380
I assume you're here for a reason.
What do you want from me?

522
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,560
When your son is in a coma,

523
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,550
You're the one who's going to have to 
make the medical decisions for him.

524
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,030
Oh, whatever you decide is fine.

525
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,920
You don't care what I do?

526
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,170
I'm not a doctor. What do I know?

527
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,090
Except what Eric tells me.

528
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:18,160
He says you're the best 
doctor he's ever worked with.

529
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,190
I need your help.

530
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,470
There's nothing I can give you for the pain.

531
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,100
I want to be put out.

532
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,200
I can have a nurse in here in five minutes.

533
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,750
No. Want some help.

534
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,690
I might not come back.

535
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,360
I've never done a will.

536
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,070
I'll call a lawyer for you.

537
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,080
I want you to be my medical proxy.

538
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,940
All the things that piss me 
off about you in House's office--

539
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,210
You're too emotional, too caring, 
too cautious--

540
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,020
they're all good things on this floor.

541
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,820
- Your dad is
- No.

542
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,500
- He cares about you.
- So do you.

543
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,380
I can't do this.

544
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,900
We expect family members to make 
decisions about their loved ones

545
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,540
after a ten-minute briefing

546
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,790
that we're agonizing over even 
with years of medical experience.

547
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,460
That's from my article.

548
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,790
I'm sorry, Allison.

549
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,210
I shouldn't have stolen your article.
I shouldn't have exposed you.

550
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,480
You were a friend.

551
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,620
I need to know that we're okay.

552
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,730
No.

553
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,460
I'll be your proxy,
but we're not okay.

554
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,320
You're scared you're dying. And that's 
the only reason you want to set things right.

555
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,200
We're going to get you better first,

556
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:08,200
and then, if you still want 
to apologize, I'll be around.

557
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,400
I'll call that lawyer.

558
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,700
Any improvement?

559
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,460
Well,as far as we can tell,

560
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,690
the only thing the antibiotics 
are treating is the legionella.

561
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,080
I think we need to consider 
alternate theories.

562
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,230
Like what?

563
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,870
We do the biopsy. We--

564
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,170
give the antibiotics more time.

565
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,060
There is no more time. The 
pain is almost unbearable already.

566
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,830
So he's almost in unbearable 
pain. He's not almost dead.

567
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,080
Which means we have more time.

568
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,100
Mr. Foreman?

569
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,030
We need to put your son in a coma.

570
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,850
You should be there.

571
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,590
It's a medical procedure, right?

572
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,590
Yeah.

573
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,700
But once we put him out, 
if--if we don't solve this,

574
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,590
he won't wake up.

575
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,920
What should I say?

576
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,720
Should I talk to him like 
it's going to be...okay?

577
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,400
Or should I be saying good-bye?

578
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,280
I need to know what 
people say when--

579
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,800
Just tell him you love him.

580
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,330
Hey,son.

581
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,160
Hey, dad.

582
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,710
It's going to be okay.

583
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,560
You don't know that.

584
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,500
I know.

585
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,900
You don't.

586
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,230
I don't want to miss you.

587
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,150
I love you too, Dad.

588
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,740
Hey.

589
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,490
It's gonna to be okay.

590
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,420
- Can we do this now?
- Yeah,of course.

591
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,750
I accept your apology.

592
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,040
Why weren't you with Foreman?

593
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,310
I hang out in the basement,
you rag on me.

594
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,100
I stay in my office,
you rag on me.

595
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,120
Honkey just can't buy a break.

596
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,360
Do the biopsy.

597
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,480
Based on the cop's progression, I 
figure he's got about another four hours--

598
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,750
You figure?

599
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,760
You're playing Russian roulette,
but the gun's pointed at him.

600
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,540
No, cutting open his 
head is what's dangerous.

601
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,110
Oh, it's dangerous.
Well, what would people think?

602
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,010
The reason you don't see patients 
is because if you know them,

603
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,530
- you'll give a crap about them. 
- I know you.

604
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,010
If you give a crap, you stop 
making outrageous calls.

605
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,790
If this was any other patient,

606
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,340
you'd have damned the risk and 
cut their head open a long time ago.

607
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,710
He's out. The EEG shows 
he's still in pain.

608
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,830
The antibiotics have had more than 
enough time. We're doing the brain biopsy.

609
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,800
Not unless you people can't come up 
with something clever in the next three hours.

610
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,550
Now. We're doing it now.

611
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,870
- Who died and made you boss?
- Foreman.

612
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,830
It's legal.

613
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,570
He's out of his mind.

614
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,510
Yesterday he was giggling 
about a hole in a guy's head.

615
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,140
Then hire a lawyer and challenge it.
In the meantime, Cameron's in charge.

616
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,020
Why would he sign that?

617
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,020
It's nothing personal, Mr. Foreman.

618
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,590
My son doesn't trust me.
How exactly is that not personal?

619
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,730
I'm sorry.

620
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,140
You're sorry?

621
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,080
You're talking about this man's son.

622
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,360
- You're denying him the right to be a part of
- Oh, shut up, House.

623
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,440
If you want to do the biopsy,
do the biopsy.

624
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,150
If House tries to interfere, let me 
know and I will take care of it.

625
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,410
Yeah. You're a hero.

626
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:15,270
If it wasn't for you, we'd be cutting into 
a dead guy's head instead of Foreman's.

627
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,850
Sorry.

628
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,760
Thanks.

629
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,830
- That was great!
- It was rude and unnecessary.

630
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,900
Yeah.

631
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,930
Go away.

632
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,320
Give me time.

633
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,420
- We're out of time.
- An hour.

634
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,240
What does "out of time" mean?

635
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,090
His O2 stats are 94 right now.

636
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,120
His lungs are about 90. The danger 
of fatal arrhythmia doesn't increase.

637
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,100
So what? There's no point in waiting.

638
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,530
You were right. We should be 
cutting into a corpse's head.

639
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,310
Yeah,we should be, except the 
CDC's got the cop's body--

640
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,170
There's got to be other bodies.

641
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,390
You think this thing 
has killed other people?

642
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,990
No.

643
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,700
That apartment was a dump.

644
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,380
Just because Steve McQueen didn't get sick 
doesn't mean some other vermin didn't.

645
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,080
You give me an hour. I go 
back there, I find a dead animal,

646
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,730
I cut its head open 
instead of Foreman's.

647
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,080
Foreman's already 
on 100% oxygen.

648
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,200
Once his O2 seds hit 90, 
I can't wait any longer.

649
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,000
Where's your suit?

650
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,620
Either you'll find the answer,
or I'll find the answer.

651
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,450
Doesn't matter.

652
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,950
Prep the drill.

653
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:29,170
We gotta be ready to 
go if we get the signal.

654
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,100
92.

655
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,820
I found a blind bird.

656
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,820
Great.

657
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,370
How fast can you get it in here?

658
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,710
I'll know in about 30 seconds.

659
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,340
You better have the bird.
The surgical team's in place.

660
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,130
I screwed up.

661
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,830
How can you not 
capture a blind bird?

662
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,910
That's not what I meant.

663
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,120
I screwed up the 
first time through this place.

664
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,570
Foreman told you everywhere he went.

665
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,130
It's not where, it's when.

666
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,080
He came here early afternoon.

667
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,390
Me and Steve came through two 
hours too late. You were six hours early.

668
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,130
It's the water. The irrigation
system only pumps--

669
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,120
House, I tested the water.
The water's clean.

670
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,650
House.

671
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,550
We tested the wrong water.

672
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,480
He stole cable, he stole 
fertilizer, and he stole water.

673
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,230
It's riddled with Naegleria.

674
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,010
I know.

675
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,330
You already did the biopsy.

676
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,800
I thought I had no choice.

677
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,630
How's my son?

678
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,640
He has primary amebic 
meningoencephalitis.

679
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:05,970
It's a parasite that goes through 
the nose and migrates into the brain,

680
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,910
where it feeds on brain cells.

681
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:12,500
The Legionella attacked the parasite.
That's why the disease slowed down.

682
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,260
Is it treatable?

683
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,830
We started him on an antiparasitic,

684
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:19,420
and the amoebas will 
clear out of his system.

685
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,480
And he'll be okay?

686
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,090
Then--then we'll wean 
him out of the coma--

687
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,910
will he be okay?

688
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,060
There'll be no lasting 
damage from the parasite.

689
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,300
But the surgery?

690
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,520
We don't know.

691
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,540
How are you feeling?

692
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,080
Can you talk?

693
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,630
I don't feel anything.

694
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,900
Are you numb?

695
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,900
No,I--I mean...

696
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,450
I don't feel any pain.

697
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,540
Keep your head still.
Follow my finger.

698
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,140
I'm okay.

699
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:01,070
Your breath stinks.
And you're peeing into a bag.

700
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,190
What are our names?

701
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,770
You did the biopsy?

702
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,430
Thank you.

703
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,770
Names?

704
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,810
Cameron.

705
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,020
My dad.

706
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,640
And the manipulative bastard.

707
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,280
You remembered.

708
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,170
How you doing, Dad?

709
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,820
Great.

710
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,450
Relieved. Great.

711
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,500
What did I have?

712
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,610
Naegleria.

713
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,730
Biopsy showed the amoeba. 
CDC autopsy eventually found the amoeba.

714
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,910
And House found it in the
water on the cop's roof.

715
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,900
Wiggle your left toes.

716
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,020
Wait, wait.

717
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,360
You went back 
and she did the biopsy?

718
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,150
Your left toes, Foreman.

719
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,470
I just did.

720
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,060
No, you didn't.

721
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,800
He can't move his toes?

722
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:58,910
He can move them.

723
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,030
Raise your right arm.

724
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,640
What?
