1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,749
Two spades.

2
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:08,834
Three hearts.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,378
It's all yours.

4
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:13,839
I fold.

5
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:16,549
And that's five.

6
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:19,176
- And that's six.
- Yay!

7
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:20,343
Not bad.

8
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:24,388
On a slam contract, you normally
want to play your winners early.

9
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:25,348
Sorry, Dad.

10
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:27,683
Nah. You're learning.
You're doing fine.

11
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:30,769
Woman:
Connie Gilman's a good player.
And a widow.

12
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:35,189
I should, uh, take her out
because she can play bridge.

13
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:37,691
You're a true romantic.

14
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:41,236
Woman 2:
You should ask somebody out.
You think Cecile's not dating yet?

15
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:44,321
- Cecile was dating before she left.
- Oh, shut up, Marv.

16
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:47,407
No. I have a partner.
And she's doing great.

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,575
Amy should be out having fun.

18
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:52,620
I'm having fun.

19
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:53,829
Yeah.

20
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,081
Look like you're having
the time of your life.

21
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:08,132
- One no trump.
- (Woman, laughing) Ooh!

22
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:12,469
I'm just...a little nauseous.
I, uh, I think I ate too much.

23
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:14,804
- Can we take a break?
- Of course.

24
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:16,556
Excuse us.

25
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:20,142
What did you eat?

26
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:21,268
Nothing weird.

27
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:23,853
- Have you been drinking?
- No, Dad. You know I don't--

28
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:26,063
Because I don't mind if you--

29
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:27,522
Dad?

30
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:31,651
[Echoing] Dad?

31
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,362
Dad, what are you doing?

32
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:41,409
You're scaring me.
It hurts. Let go!

33
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:43,453
What are you doing?

34
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,496
Man:
Henry?

35
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:49,332
Henry.
Let go of her.

36
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:54,670
The occasional drink
doesn't bother me. But...

37
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,172
What?

38
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:58,298
Are you okay?

39
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:00,341
What's the matter?

40
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:10,849
2X14 - Sex Kills

41
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:35,661
Original Airdate (FOX): 7 March-2006

42
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:43,709
You had what's called
an "absence seizure."

43
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:45,711
Anything like that
happen to you before?

44
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:46,962
No, Nothing.

45
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:50,173
He's been really healthy.
He jogs, he eats right. He--

46
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:53,217
I--well, I did have
a headache last Sunday.

47
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,178
And for the past two years,
I've been getting acid reflux a lot.

48
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,723
And I thought that, uh,
antacids were all I needed.

49
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,391
Should I have come in sooner?

50
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,392
For acid reflux and a headache?

51
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,692
Well, I--you know,
I hear the coffee downstairs
is really good.

52
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,860
Could you get me a cup, Honey?

53
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:22,532
Would you mind
closing the blinds?

54
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:29,579
Foreman:
His right testicle is almost
twice as big as his left.

55
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:30,580
Cool.

56
00:03:30,663 --> 00:03:32,665
It's probably testicular cancer.

57
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,917
Mmm, no.
That's impossible.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,670
- The symptoms all indicate--
- The shoes aren't right.

59
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:43,674
Here's how testicular cancer
would manifest itself.

60
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,593
First, the patient would get
the exact symptoms that he's got.

61
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,386
Then Foreman would examine him.

62
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:52,807
Then he'd suspect
testicular cancer on account of
the symptoms being so perfect.

63
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,517
Then he'd stick a needle in it.
Then he'd call a surgeon.

64
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,770
And while that guy operates,
the rest of us would be out bowling.

65
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,898
And since we're not
wearing bowling shoes,

66
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:05,233
the disease obviously
did not progress in that fashion.

67
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:08,194
LP showed some white cells.
But his MRI is clean.

68
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:11,988
Sure. If you call a microabscess
in his brain "clean."

69
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:15,367
What, you don't trust me?

70
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,535
Are you talking about
the left temporal lobe?

71
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,578
Neat. You can see
through my hand.

72
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:21,788
- It's just a shadow.
- Or it's an infection.

73
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:26,500
When guys have brain/crotch problems,
it's usually the result of using
one too much and the other too little.

74
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,670
Blood and urine were negative for
syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.

75
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:31,755
So treat him for all three.
Stat.

76
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,340
Um...negative means
he doesn't have it.

77
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:38,051
No. Negative means
he probably doesn't have it.
Which means he probably has cancer.

78
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:39,844
I thought we were wearing
the wrong shoes for cancer.

79
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:42,555
We're wearing the wrong shoes
for testicular cancer.

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,431
They're perfect for lymphoma.

81
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:46,725
Except Chase's.
They're just goofy.

82
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:50,686
Lymphoma could cause infiltrants
in his reproductive organs and his brain.

83
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:53,147
If it's this advanced,
he's dead no matter what we do.

84
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:57,067
So give him the STD meds
and hope the tests were wrong.

85
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:04,572
Svinnuk.

86
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:06,408
Who's the lucky woman?

87
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,284
My wife.

88
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:10,786
No, I don't want to know
who gets the chocolates.

89
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:12,913
I want to know who
you're having the affair with.

90
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:16,290
Fell on his head as a child.
Tragic.

91
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,417
Norwegian chocolate.

92
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:21,420
Frankly,
you buy that stuff,
the terrorists win.

93
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:26,131
Some people bottle up their feelings,
have them come out as physical pain.

94
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:29,968
Healthy human beings express feelings,
such as affection, by giving gifts.

95
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:31,762
Gifts express guilt.

96
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:35,431
The more expensive the expression,
the deeper the guilt. That's a $12 box.

97
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:38,683
So either you haven't
slept with her yet,
or she wasn't that good.

98
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,560
It's not all about sex, House.

99
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:43,061
Really?
When did that change?

100
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,816
I  want to get Depo-Provera.

101
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:52,820
Actually, at your age,
as long as you're careful,

102
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:55,530
the risk of you getting
pregnant is pretty limited.

103
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:56,822
Yeah, but it would
calm me down.

104
00:05:56,864 --> 00:05:58,450
Right? If I get
a high enough dose.

105
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:03,286
You mean
"calm" as in a peaceful lake,
on cool summer evening?

106
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:08,916
Or in the lesser used meaning of,
nothing can ever bother you again
because life has absolutely no meaning?

107
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:12,336
High dose of Depo-Provera
will chemically castrate you.

108
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:13,879
Yeah.

109
00:06:17,715 --> 00:06:20,800
Okay. I'm gonna
get up to leave now.

110
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:22,928
And  I'm gonna walk to that door,
turn the handle.

111
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:26,138
And then you're
suddenly gonna decide that
you have to tell me the truth.

112
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:28,515
I'm gonna have to turn around
and come all the way back.

113
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:30,475
See, the thing is,
my leg hurts.

114
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,269
Can we cut the walking
out of the equation?

115
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,688
I love cows.

116
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,736
Any particular...variety?

117
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:46,946
Guernseys? Holsteins?

118
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,824
Which are the black and white ones?

119
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,200
Oh, God.

120
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:53,369
I pass a farm
on my way to school.

121
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:55,120
And they're so beautiful.

122
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,622
They're so majestic.
I dream about them.

123
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:03,669
Leather shoes, hamburgers.
How can anybody do that to a cow?

124
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:06,796
Make love, not belts.
It's beautiful.

125
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,131
- I haven't actually--
- Well, relax.

126
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:11,424
Something we doctors
deal with all the time.

127
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:13,593
I'm gonna write you
the name of a drug.

128
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:16,721
You don't need a prescription.
And it looks just like Depo-Provera.

129
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,389
- But does it do the same thing?
- Oh, God, no.

130
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:23,392
That stuff has
all sorts of nasty side effects.
It's real medicine.

131
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:25,102
No, this is all you need.

132
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,105
Your frat buddies will
be completely fooled.

133
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:30,815
Tell them how appalled
the doctor was.

134
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:32,775
Lots of laughs.

135
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:36,611
We think you may have
a sexually transmitted disease.

136
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:38,112
No. It's not possible.

137
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,865
Sir, maybe we should
speak in private?

138
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,658
Have you tested him for this?

139
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:43,743
The tests were negative.

140
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:45,744
Well, then it's not that.

141
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:48,329
So what else could it be?

142
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,789
Nothing good.

143
00:07:49,872 --> 00:07:52,875
If you've been having sex,
you have to tell me.

144
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,128
I have not had sex
since my divorce.

145
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,132
I didn't ask him
to take the medicine.

146
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,092
I asked you
to give him the medicine.

147
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:05,969
He  hasn't had sex
in over a year.

148
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,262
- He's lying.
- He knows what's at stake.

149
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,931
We should start treating him
for lymphoma right away.

150
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,558
- Maybe if we hit him hard and fast--
- Wilson!

151
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:15,768
How long can you
go without sex?

152
00:08:15,851 --> 00:08:17,603
How long can you
go without annoying people?

153
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:19,605
No, seriously.
Week? Month?

154
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,106
I'm not having an affair.

155
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,900
I didn't say you were.
Not in this conversation.

156
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,359
We're talking about a patient.

157
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:28,611
People have impulse control.
We don't need sex.

158
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:31,948
Well, not like air.
But as a biological imperative,
sure we do.

159
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:34,909
There's two things
we get stupid for.
Money and sex.

160
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:37,452
And since money rarely
enters the bloodstream...

161
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:40,037
Was his daughter in the room
when you asked if he'd had sex?

162
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:42,915
I told him we could talk privately.
He didn't care if she was there.

163
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:45,959
It's almost noon.
Little girl would go to lunch.

164
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:49,420
Soon as she's out the door,
you're gonna get paged.
Then you page me.

165
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:53,215
[Foreman's pager beeps]

166
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:56,760
Lunch is early, huh?

167
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,140
Hi.

168
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,350
I'm Dr. House.

169
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,021
I hear you'd rather die
than admit you had sex.

170
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:13,815
I'm sorry. I...
couldn't tell my daughter.

171
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,275
Right. 'Cause she's...what, 22?

172
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:18,360
I slept with her mom.

173
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:22,906
She probably knows
that's happened already.

My wife had an affair.
I forgave her.

176
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:34,749
She had another affair.
And I forgave her again. And...

177
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,584
Amy thinks I was an idiot.

178
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:40,795
So smart.
You must be very proud.
Roll over.

179
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:43,672
I assume you've been in love.

180

Is that the one that
makes your pants feel funny?

Amy is just getting over it.

183
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,805
She barely spoke to her mom
for months actually.

184
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:58,851
If she thought that
it was happening again,
that that's why I got sick--

185

We just happened to be at
the same Italian cheese-tasting thing.

186
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,777
Cheese is the devil's play thing.

187
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,405
It was just the one night.

188
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,949
Oh, you're obviously
completely over her.

189
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:20,035
Amy thinks love leads you
to make stupid choices.

190
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:22,537
You're certainly setting
a good example for her.

191
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,246
Yeah. She just doesn't get it.

then nothing great is

I guess your testicles
aren't going to explode either.

It wouldn't.

It was flash pulmonary edema.

We took a liter of fluid off, but
the problem wasn't with his lungs.
It's his heart.

211
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,190
There are vegetations
obstructing his mitral valve.

212
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:52,317
It's not an STD.
Lymphoma wouldn't
erupt that suddenly.

213

So what is it, then?
A disease that attacks
his brain, heart, and testicles.

- Then why are you--
- Advocating for my patient.

338
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:03,582
I've got clinic duty.

339
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:06,792
I need you to get me the files
on everybody who dies here today.

340
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:09,920
You really think this thing'll
change their decision?

341
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:11,088
Nope.

342
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:20,053
Mooooo!

343
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:22,514
I think I broke my ankle.

344
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:25,141
I was kicked. By a hoof.

345
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:29,185
I'm so in love.
She was so beautiful.

346
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:31,562
-  Which one?
- One of the black and white ones.

347
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:34,231
- I'm not sure what type.
- Which "type"? Which one?

348
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:35,691
I want a name.

349
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,569
- Why would it have a name?
- Well, not "it." She. Or he.

350
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:42,071
I want to know
her dreams, her hopes.

351
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:43,822
It's a cow.

352
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:46,824
Hey, I'm not the one
who said he was in love.

353
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:54,956
People who actually have this condition
rationalize it. They dismiss it.
They don't elevate it to the level of poetry.

354
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,291
Plus there's
a wooden splinter in there.

355
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:01,212
So either you hit yourself
with a two-by-four
or Elsie has a peg leg.

356
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:03,213
I'm off duty at 6:00.

357
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:06,215
Give yourself another whack,
come back and scam somebody else.

358
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:10,052
I'm sick. And you're a doctor.
You have a duty to help me.

359
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:13,472
Technically I don't
have to treat anybody.

360
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:19,643
Before running a series of
painful and often humiliating tests.

361
00:20:23,938 --> 00:20:25,522
Whatever you need.

362
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:28,108
90-year-old woman
died of pneumonia.

363
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:30,485
Unless she has a bionic heart,
what's next?

364
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:35,280
- Um...baby died in the ICU.
- Babies are useless.

365
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,782
They've got hearts the size
of ping-pong balls. Next?

366
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:40,910
Um...40-year-old male...

367
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:42,411
Yes?

368
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:43,954
Heart attack.

369
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:47,707
If you really cared about me,
you'd find me a better corpse.

370
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,626
There's no other deaths.
There's one woman who
was in a car accident.

371
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:51,961
Bad one, I hope.

372
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:54,254
The organ procurement people
have been notified.

373
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,255
Give me her file.

374
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,131
It's in the ER.
They're still working on her.

375
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,884
- Age?
- About 40.

376
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,511
- Young. Damn.
- Young is good.

377
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:05,472
- Smoker?
- Don't know.

378
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,431
Find out.

379
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:09,516
She's still alive.
Even if we get on the list,
we can't go near her until--

380
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,018
Overweight?

381
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:13,227
She's on the hefty side.

382
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:15,437
Excellent.
Our odds just went up.

383
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:17,356
What odds?
What is this?

384
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,694
60 % of potential donor hearts
get tossed in the trash because
there's something wrong with them.

385
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:24,570
With fat people,
it's closer to 80.

386
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:26,280
But if her heart's
no good, then--

387
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:30,033
Big, fat, sloppy heart.
Beats no heart at all.

388
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:50,841
- Are you Mr. Neuberger?
- Yes.

389
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:52,134
I'm Dr. House.

390
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:53,968
Need to ask you a few questions
about your wife.

391
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:55,136
Is she gonna be okay?

392
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:57,055
I'm afraid I don't know that.

393
00:21:57,389 --> 00:21:58,848
Could you tell me
about her accident?

394
00:21:59,015 --> 00:22:02,309
They, uh, think she fell asleep,
went off the road.
That's all they told me.

395
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:04,769
Any problems with her health
up until now?

396
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:05,728
Why?

397
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:09,065
Please, it's important.

398
00:22:09,357 --> 00:22:10,524
Um...

399
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:12,442
she had a fever today,
but otherwise she was--

400
00:22:12,526 --> 00:22:13,860
How high?

401
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:15,736
About 101.

402
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:19,489
She hasn't missed a day
of teaching in years.

403
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:22,492
And I should've
made her stay home.

404
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:25,119
Any other symptoms?

405
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,663
A stomachache. Who cares?
She was in a car crash.

406
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,664
- Mr. Neuberger.
- Yeah.

407
00:22:29,747 --> 00:22:33,167
My name's Ellen Stambler.
I'm the organ procurement coordinator
for Southern New Jersey.

408
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,379
I just want to assure you
that we'll treat her organs
with care and dignity.

409
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:41,299
Her organs?

410
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:46,177
Laura died?

411
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:49,430
I--I'm sorry.
I thought, um--

412
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:54,476
She was just pronounced dead.
I thought he was telling you.

413
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:55,810
I didn't know.

414
00:22:57,228 --> 00:22:59,564
You should never make assumptions.

415
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:04,526
What did you want from me?

416
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:09,571
I'm sorry for your loss.

417
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:13,241
But I need your wife's heart.

418
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:20,997
The organ procurement coordinator
just left the hospital.

419
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:24,041
Means we got lucky.
Either that or she's getting lunch.

420
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,503
Dead woman's last name
have a "U" or "W"?

421
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:29,671
You're hacking into
a confidential patient file?

422
00:23:29,754 --> 00:23:31,422
Is that a problem for you?

423
00:23:31,923 --> 00:23:34,091
It's a "U". N-E-U.

424
00:23:34,424 --> 00:23:36,176
Berger.

425
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:43,807
Three minutes ago,
her organs were officially
declared not viable.

426
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:45,892
Time to go dumpster diving.

427
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,650
Hey.

428
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:58,986
She's got hepatitis C.
Her ALTs are three times normal.

429
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:01,863
With Henry's immune system down,
an infected heart will kill him.

430
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:03,699
Fortunately,
she didn't have hep C.

431
00:24:03,782 --> 00:24:06,159
- She tested positive.
- Her history says otherwise.

432
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:08,536
Her husband told me
she was running a fever
with stomach pains.

433
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:10,787
Not symptomatic of hep C.

434
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,440
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

435
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:46,399
Hey. What are you doing?

436
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:49,110
Again, sorry.

437
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:51,111
But we need to talk.

438
00:24:52,904 --> 00:24:55,616
Mr. Neuberger has every right
to take his wife off the ventilator.

439
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:57,867
His wife signed
an organ donor card.

440
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:00,786
Which became invalid when
her organs were turned down.

441
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:03,580
I can use them!
I just need some time.

442
00:25:03,955 --> 00:25:05,539
Committee says
they won't take her heart.

443
00:25:05,623 --> 00:25:07,792
Another committee says
the guy can't have a heart.

444
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,585
It's a marriage made in heaven.

445
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:11,420
I can find a surgical team
that can do this.

446
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:14,338
Classified as experimental,
it's not gonna screw
with their numbers.

447
00:25:14,422 --> 00:25:15,464
- This is what she wanted.
- No.

448
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:16,507
She wanted her organs to help--

449
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,800
She never wanted to
be kept alive on a ventilator.

450
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,844
She's not. She's dead!

451
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:23,763
She's not in pain.
She's not suffering.
It's just her...

452
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:25,890
meat we're dealing with here.

453
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:30,810
- This is my wife.
- Not anymore.

454
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:33,730
She deserves some respect.
Some dignity.

455
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:35,439
- I respect the living.
- Right.

456
00:25:35,523 --> 00:25:38,066
That is why you made me think
that you were her doctor.

457
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:40,776
Made me believe that
maybe there was some hope.

458
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:43,028
I never said that
I was her doctor.

459
00:25:43,153 --> 00:25:45,280
Fine, you didn't lie.
But you sure as hell
didn't give me any respect.

460
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:47,699
I am taking her
off the machines. Now.

461
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:51,493
Nicely played.

462
00:25:51,577 --> 00:25:52,911
It's not over.

463
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:01,335
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Neuberger?

464
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:03,378
Yeah. Why?

465
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:05,380
I'm Amy Arrington.

466
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,840
I wanted to thank you.

467
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:20,016
This girl's father will die
by next weekend unless
he gets your wife's heart.

468
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,518
House. Don't you think
that's a little manipulative?

469
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:25,813
No. It's hugely manipulative.

470
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:27,273
You're an ass.

471
00:26:27,481 --> 00:26:30,608
Hey. Listen!
You take your wife
off life support,

472
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:33,319
and I'll have forgotten
about this in two weeks.

473
00:26:33,402 --> 00:26:35,945
- Gail here, on the other hand--
- Amy.

474
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,698
Whatever.

475
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:42,785
You're mad at me.
Fine, I get that.
Take it out on me. Not on her.

476
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:53,669
Oof!

477
00:26:59,506 --> 00:27:04,553
Fine. Your dad can, uh...
have her heart.

478
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:30,031
Fever. Stomach pain.
Raised liver enzymes.

479
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:31,157
She's sick.

480
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:33,367
Worse than that.
She's dead.

481
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:36,495
My point is,
even if it's not hep C,
it's something.

482
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:40,373
They turned her down as a donor
because if we put that heart
into someone, they won't survive.

483
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:42,250
Whatever made her sick
will kill him.

484
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:44,793
Yeah. So what is it?

485
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,044
Enzymes indicate--

486
00:27:46,128 --> 00:27:48,880
You want us to do
a differential diagnosis
on a dead person?

487
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:50,089
We're going to cure her.

488
00:27:50,214 --> 00:27:51,465
We're going to cure death?

489
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,885
[Laughs theatrically like a demon]
Doubt it.

490
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:58,763
Just want to get the infection
out of her heart before
we get the heart out of her.

491
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,681
The fever indicates an infection.

492
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,766
She probably has hep C
and a bad case of the flu.

493
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:08,104
Let's assume, just for fun,
that the answer is something
that might be helpful.

494
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,523
Fever and belly pain
could be a gall bladder infection.

495
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,982
Like that.

496
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:15,276
Do an MRI. Stat.

497
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:24,867
You really don't need to be here.

498
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:28,703
I assume, uh,
House is a great doctor.

499
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,204
Why would you assume that?

500
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:34,125
Because, uh,
when you're that big a jerk,
you're either great or unemployed.

501
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:40,379
No sign of gall bladder infection.
But there was a cyst.

502
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:42,506
Perfectly round.
Now, hep C wouldn't cause--

503
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:44,258
The question was never,
is it hep C?

504
00:28:44,342 --> 00:28:47,177
The question was given
that it's not hep C, what is it?

505
00:28:47,385 --> 00:28:49,303
- Adenoma?
- Not solid enough.

506
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:50,888
Cavernous hemangioma?

507
00:28:51,138 --> 00:28:53,223
Not vascular enough.

508
00:28:53,723 --> 00:28:57,644
What if she was sloppy about
washing her hands after pooping?

509
00:28:57,727 --> 00:28:59,729
Uh...amoeba infection?

510
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:04,524
If the amebiasis started in her liver,
then spread to her blood,
that would explain all her symptoms.

511
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:07,484
Except for the crushed skull, but
I'm assuming that's from the car crash.

512
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:09,527
I'll start her on
paromomycin and chloroquine.

513
00:29:09,611 --> 00:29:10,863
Ten grams each.

514
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:13,990
That's...20 times
the normal dose.

515
00:29:14,365 --> 00:29:17,534
Right. So we'll destroy
her retinas and damage her hearing.

516
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:20,286
Whoever wants those parts
is having a very bad day.

517
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:23,081
Couple hours on the meds,
she'll be feeling great.

518
00:29:29,878 --> 00:29:31,462
Got your labs.

519
00:29:31,962 --> 00:29:33,964
- Do you eat guinea pigs?
- No.

520
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,842
How about hamsters or mice?

521
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,051
Humans?

522
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,469
What are you talking about?

523
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:41,179
Is something wrong with me?

524
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:42,888
Absolutely nothing.

525
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:44,723
Your blood work is perfect.

526
00:29:44,848 --> 00:29:48,727
You've got lots of vitamins,
minerals. All kinds of proteins.

527
00:29:49,227 --> 00:29:53,772
Including a little something
I like to call bovine serum albumin.

528
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:56,816
Which you get from eating
the animals mentioned.

529
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:58,942
Or cow.

530
00:30:00,485 --> 00:30:02,863
You don't really worship cows.

531
00:30:02,988 --> 00:30:04,156
So I have to wonder,

532
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:10,035
what could be more humiliating than
someone calling your girlfriend a cow
and not being metaphorical?

533
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:27,508
- Nice.
- It's my mom.

534
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:33,345
Well, either that's
a very old photograph,
or it's your stepmom.

535
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:36,431
She goes around the house
in a bikini. Or less.

536
00:30:36,473 --> 00:30:38,266
I-I can't stop
thinking about her.

537
00:30:38,432 --> 00:30:42,561
My dad's in Europe.
I'll be watching TV,
she'll give me a massage.

538
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:43,854
I can't walk for an hour.

539
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:47,523
- Still. Cows?
- She's my mother!

540
00:30:47,607 --> 00:30:48,733
Step.

541
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:51,735
Please.

542
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:55,447
I just need the medicine
for three months until I graduate
and I move out of the house.

543
00:30:58,491 --> 00:30:59,783
Please.

544
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:04,537
You're not gonna have
any fun at graduation.

545
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:08,874
Keep up the good work.

546
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:10,959
Your shirt is ironed.

547
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:13,503
That means you haven't
told your wife anything.

548
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:15,963
Let's say you're right.

549
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,550
You're saying I'm right?

550
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:22,635
No. Let is saying.

551
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:27,264
Does it occur to you that maybe
there's some deeper guidance
than "keep your mouth shut"?

552
00:31:27,305 --> 00:31:32,685
That maybe a friend might value
concern over glibness? That maybe...

553
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:40,024
Maybe I'm going through
something that I need to have
an actual conversation about?

554
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:44,195
[Hosue's beeper goes off]

555
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:52,242
Does it occur to you that
if you need that kind of a friend,
you may have made some deeper errors.

556
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:02,084
Chase:
Her heartbeat's irregular.

557
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:04,585
Looks like global hypokinesis.

558
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:11,675
Stop the meds.

559
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,094
You're giving up?

560
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:18,013
Either we're wrong
and her heart is unusable...

561
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:22,184
or right, but the treatment
we had to give her will
make her heart unusable.

562
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:27,020
I'm sorry.
You can pull the plug now.

563
00:32:27,437 --> 00:32:28,563
Find me another body.

564
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,898
That fat guy on Ortho service
didn't look so hot.

565
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,274
No!

566
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:34,819
She's not ready.

567
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:38,155
You were ready this morning.

568
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:39,822
She's not done.

569
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:43,659
She's gotta save that guy.

570
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:53,417
House:
Alternate theories?

571
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:56,210
Amebiasis was our best hope.

572
00:32:56,377 --> 00:32:59,379
The fact that her heart rate
went back to normal when
we stopped the meds pretty much--

573
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:01,173
What's our second best hope?

574
00:33:01,257 --> 00:33:02,883
House, put down the wand.

575
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:04,467
There's no obstruction.

576
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:07,011
Maybe we should just biopsy it.

577
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:09,513
She's a fridge
with the power out.

578
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:13,308
We start poking around inside,
the vegetable goes bad.

579
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:16,227
No offense.

580
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,020
I don't see that
we have a lot of choice.

581
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:19,521
The only way we're
gonna find that infection--

582
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:20,772
Cameron:
What if it's not an infection?

583
00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:24,650
Toxins can cause similar symptoms.
Especially if whatever it is did liver damage.

584
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:26,944
Her, uh, toxin screen was clean.

585
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:30,113
Those things never cover
for any of the really cool toxins.

586
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:33,115
Run the screen again
for whatever you can think of.

587
00:33:33,324 --> 00:33:35,325
You, keep the other patient alive.

588
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:37,160
You, check out the school.

589
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:40,955
And I seem to need
o hire another doctor
to go search her home.

590
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,291
Come on.

591
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,295
If she was taking
any medications,
I'd know about it.

592
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:54,675
Did your wife dye her hair?

593
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,092
No.

594
00:33:56,217 --> 00:33:58,052
Her mom never went gray.

595
00:33:58,177 --> 00:33:59,094
She didn't either.

596
00:33:59,553 --> 00:34:01,304
Guess this must be yours, then.

597
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:04,308
Can you think of anything else
she might've lied to you about?

598
00:34:04,391 --> 00:34:07,935
Any drugs she "gave up"
when she married you?

599
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:20,779
How are you feeling, sir?

600
00:34:21,112 --> 00:34:22,739
Mr. Arrington?

601
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,281
Mr. Arrington?

602
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:25,991
[Monitor starts beeping]

603
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:28,201
What's going on?

604
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:30,328
His heart's not pumping
enough blood to his brain.

605
00:34:30,412 --> 00:34:31,996
We're gonna have to
give it some help.

606
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:34,081
Get the balloon ready.

607
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:40,669
You use this drawer?

608
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,130
Neuberger:
No, that's for her vitamins.

609
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:45,507
And sleeping pills.

610
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:47,717
She never took sleeping pills.

611
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:49,302
Okay.

612
00:34:51,678 --> 00:34:53,221
You on a diet?

613
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:54,848
No.

614
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:03,480
I guess you never really
know someone, do you?

615
00:35:04,397 --> 00:35:06,440
Quite the insight.

616
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:08,776
She lied to you
about her hair color.

617
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,695
And didn't want you to know
she thought she was fat.

618
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:15,448
Unless you never lied to her
about anything that huge.

619
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:18,116
And then you can
probably let those slide.

620
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,412
Diet pills could've
messed her up.

621
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,872
Raised the live enzymes
and caused the bellyache.

622
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,457
But not the fever.

623
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,583
Maybe something else
set off the fever.

624
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:30,001
Like what?

625
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:32,419
Before I show you these,
they were in a locked drawer
in her desk.

626
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:35,881
The vice principal said that
Laura must've confiscated them.
They've had some problems with--

627
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:38,091
Neither interesting nor helpful.

628
00:35:39,425 --> 00:35:42,344
This at least is interesting.

629
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:44,721
[Scoffs]
No, it's not.

630
00:35:44,804 --> 00:35:47,682
Sex with teenagers
isn't interesting?
Where did you grow up?

631
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:50,851
It isn't helpful.
Teenage boys aren't toxins.

632
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:54,479
What if the cyst isn't a cyst?

633
00:35:54,604 --> 00:35:56,981
Then we have nothing to go on.

634
00:35:57,106 --> 00:35:59,650
I said it's not a cyst.
I didn't say it was nothing.

635
00:35:59,775 --> 00:36:01,026
What if it's a scar?

636
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,819
Foreman:
Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome?

637
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:04,863
You're pushing gonorrhea again?

638
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,655
You got anything better?

639
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:10,033
Test her.
And start her on ceftriaxone.

640
00:36:23,085 --> 00:36:24,796
What are you testing for now?

641
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:28,924
Just some more infections.

642
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,936
She's positive for gonorrhea.

643
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,817
I think that's the first time
those words have been uttered in joy.

644
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,984
Meds are started.

645
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:54,194
Her heart should be clear enough
to use in about four or five hours.

646
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:55,904
I'll go tell the families.

647
00:36:56,154 --> 00:36:57,280
He's in a coma.

648
00:36:57,446 --> 00:36:58,906
Start him on dobutamine.

649
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:00,240
Already did.

650
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,327
We either do the surgery now
or we find him a new brain too.

651
00:37:04,995 --> 00:37:08,372
House, she's still got
a significant amount of
gonorrhea in her system.

652
00:37:08,747 --> 00:37:12,583
Hopefully tomorrow,
it'll be in his system.

653
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:16,504
I need two O.R.s
and the transplant team.

654
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:21,591
What is it?

655
00:37:28,972 --> 00:37:30,348
Amy:
What's going on?

656
00:37:30,557 --> 00:37:32,600
- Is he getting a heart?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

657
00:37:44,151 --> 00:37:46,945
I assume this means
you, uh, you found out
what was wrong with Laura?

658
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:56,286
She had a amebiasis.

659
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:59,121
We just found a different way
to get rid of it.

660
00:38:01,832 --> 00:38:02,832
Thank you.

661
00:38:07,503 --> 00:38:08,879
That was kind of you.

662
00:38:09,004 --> 00:38:11,381
I didn't want him
going postal on us.

663
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:15,217
Soon as his wife's heart's in our hands,
you can tell him about the gonorrhea.

664
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:18,094
He's gotta be tested.

665
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:21,264
Preferably before he gets
any sympathy sex.

666
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,000
Paddles.

667
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,714
50 joules.

668
00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:08,093
Charging.

669
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:15,349
Charging.

670
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:22,188
[Heart begins to beat]

671
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:24,857
Let's take him off bypass.

672
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:47,333
Mr. Neuberger.
There's something
I need to tell you.

673
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,087
The last, uh...

674
00:39:52,129 --> 00:39:55,507
year or so, uh...

675
00:39:56,466 --> 00:39:58,676
Laura was kind of
distant with me.

676
00:39:58,884 --> 00:40:00,468
I don't know why.

677
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:04,306
I thought maybe
she was having an affair.

678
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:07,975
But...not Laura.
And I'm not excusing myself,

679
00:40:08,058 --> 00:40:12,603
but when I was traveling
during Christmas, I had a...

680
00:40:13,354 --> 00:40:15,231
I had a one-night stand.

681
00:40:15,315 --> 00:40:17,024
I got gonorrhea.

682
00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:22,320
- Are you sure--
- Yeah.

683
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:25,655
I should've said
something to you.

684
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,784
But I didn't want to believe
that I gave it to her.

685
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:30,410
That's what made her sick,and...

686
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:34,038
that was why she got
into the accident.

687
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,015
Cecile?

688
00:40:59,516 --> 00:41:00,392
Am I dead?

689
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,685
Hopefully not for a long time.

690
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,438
Why are you here?

691
00:41:05,605 --> 00:41:07,315
Amy called me.

692
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:11,651
If you do Mom again,
you gotta wear a condom.

693
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,862
You're gonna have gonorrhea
in your system for a while.

"Honky Tonk Women" by Taj Mahal

695
00:41:24,745 --> 00:41:32,043
<i># I met a gin-soaked
barroom queen in Memphis #</i>

696
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:32,293
[Knock on the door]

697
00:41:35,212 --> 00:41:42,426
<i># She tried to take me
upstairs for a ride #</i>

698
00:41:45,137 --> 00:41:52,517
<i># She had to heave me
right across her shoulder #</i>

699
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,062
<i># 'Cause I just can't... #</i>

700
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:58,356
Could I stay with you
for a few days?

701
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,150
You idiot.

702
00:42:01,233 --> 00:42:02,400
You told her.

703
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:04,319
She told me.

704
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:08,196
Things have been
crappy at home lately.

705
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,491
I figured I wasn't
spending enough time there.

706
00:42:11,116 --> 00:42:12,367
I figured...

707
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:18,246
It turns out, you're right.

708
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:20,581
It's always about sex.

709
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,460
She's been having an affair.

710
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:31,882
<i># It's the honky-tonk women #</i>

711
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,634
Want a beer?

712
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:41,057
<i># That gimme, gimme, gimme
the honky-tonk blues  #</i>
