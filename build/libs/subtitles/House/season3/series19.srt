1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,690
Jasper, hold still.
Stop squirming.Hold still.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,390
What did he do now?

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,890
He got in another fight.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,590
And I can't get his nose to stop bleeding.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,490
You have to apply much more
pressure than that.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,690
You had to do this today.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,390
I got office hours.
Supposed to have dinner with the dean.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,690
You just can't lash out
whenever you get angry.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,290
He said I smell like a monkey.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,190
Well, you do.You can't refuse to
take a bath

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,790
and then hit kids who tell you
that you smell.Damn!

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,590
Don't you think we should call 911?

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,390
This isn't his first nosebleed.
He'll be fine.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,390
- Daddy!
- Hey, Lucy-goosey.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,790
- I'm playing doctor.
- So am I.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,390
can you go back and play?

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,290
- When was this fight?
- Over ten minutes ago.

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,290
I feel dizzy.

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,590
- Maybe you should make that call.
- Okay.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,990
Daddy, look.I can help.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,990
No--that's great, honey.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,990
Can you just please leave daddy alone?

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,490
one of my kids is bleeding profusely
from the nose.Please hurry.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,590
They're sending an ambulance.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,590
Call them back.

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,190
He'll be fine.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,290
How you feeling, bud?

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,690
- You light headed?
- Lucy.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,690
Oh my god.

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,590
Lucy, are you okay?Lucy.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,590
Lucy.Lucy.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,190
Lucy, are you okay?

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,990
Lucy!Lucy!

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,990
<font color="#ffff00">House
Season 03 Episode 19</font>

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,590
Oh, for god's sake.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,490
Stop.Don't move.

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,790
The way the soft...evening light
catches your eyes.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,890
The gentle caress of dusk on your hair
as you turn around

41
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,090
and leave my office
without giving me that file.

42
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,190
- Restrictive pericarditis.
- Boring.

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,790
- She's in kindergarten.
- Less boring.

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,890
Or grandma's been held back a few years.

45
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,190
It's calcified and she's hypertensive.

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,090
Better get her into surgery.

47
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,790
She already is in surgery.

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,190
Tricky procedure.Gonna take all night.

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,390
Sleep tight.

50
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,890
No congenital defects,no health problems.

51
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,990
But her heart is strangling itself.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,890
Fascinating.

53
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,590
Since the pathology on the pericardium
won't be back until after they remove it.

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,490
Get started on her blood.you can test
for viral infections,bacteria...

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,590
round up the usual suspects.

56
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,890
Amyloidosis,sarcoidosis,hemochromatosis...

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,890
heck. Go wild.Do all the osises.

58
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,290
All taken care of.Sleep tight.

59
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,690
this thing is already all around her heart.

60
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,590
If it gets into the muscle,she's dead.

61
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,590
Best bet is coxsackie virus.

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,990
Parvovirus b-19,cmv...

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,990
bacterial infection's more likely
to turn constrictive.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,990
- It could be T.B..
- Right.

65
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,890
Forgot about the part where she did time
in a Russian gulag.

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,790
Her hematocrit's elevated.

67
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,590
A few extra red blood cells means nothing.

68
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,490
She's probably just dehydrated.

69
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,290
Yes, and I could assume three or four things
to fit my theory, too.

70
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,190
She's sick.She obviously
hasn't been drinking--

71
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,290
Enough!

72
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,690
I take it you two aren't
sleeping together anymore?

73
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,690
We do what House said.
We test for everything.

74
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,590
Good.

75
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,290
Then I can go home.

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,390
Since when does we not include you?

77
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,490
Well, House is gonna call us idiots anyway.

78
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,590
Might as well be a well-rested idiot.

79
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,990
You guys are idiots.

80
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,290
Why?

81
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,890
Because we stayed up all night
doing exactly what you told us to do?

82
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,190
No, because you stayed up all night
doing exactly what I told you to do

83
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,090
and have nothing to show for it.

84
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,090
We eliminated dozens of wrong answers.

85
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,590
I asked you what two plus two equals.

86
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,090
And a day later,you tell me, not 25.

87
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,690
Pathology report just got filed.

88
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,590
Found granulomas in Lucy's pericardium.

89
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,490
Indicates a fungal infection.

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,590
Nice work.

91
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,890
He went home.

92
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,890
Work smart, not hard.

93
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,590
Find out which fungus.
Biopsy a lymph node.

94
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,790
Take "employee of the month" with you.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,490
- I would rather foreman--
- I know.

96
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,190
- I don't want anymore shots.
- I don't want anymore shots.

97
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,690
Jasper.

98
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,490
Look at me, goosey.Squeeze my hand,okay?

99
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,590
This will tell us why you're sick,
so we can make you all better.

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,190
Where would she pick up a fungus?

101
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,690
Anywhere moist.Around a pool,
locker room,public shower.

102
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,690
She doesn't have any gym or swim classes.

103
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,690
She doesn't even
like to play with kids outside.

104
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,290
Haven't taken any trips?
Gone anywhere new?

105
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,490
It's been hard to get away...
since their mom.

106
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,990
My mom is dead.

107
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,890
- I'm sorry.
- Last year.

108
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,490
Brain cancer.

109
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,990
You're gonna stick that thing
in her arm? Cool!

110
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,390
The cool part is,
your sister won't feel a thing.

111
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,590
Nice necklace.

112
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,990
Thanks.

113
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,490
You like videogames?

114
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,090
Love them.

115
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,190
That should do it.

116
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,690
You okay?

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,790
I want my bunny.

118
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,390
Are you being silly?

119
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,290
I don't know which one to take.

120
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,990
What do you mean?What's happening?

121
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,090
So what does the double vision tell us?

122
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,190
Slit lamp revealed the eye's anterior
chamber is swollen.Uveitis.

123
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,590
Means it's not a post-op effect
and it's not neurological.

124
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,990
It's not fungal either.
The lymph node biopsy was clean.

125
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,890
So we're back to square one.

126
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,290
One and a half.
We've eliminated two more conditions.

127
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,090
Yes.Two plus two doesn't equal 12 or 16 either.

128
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,190
Vision issues plus screwy heart
equals some type of auto-immune.

129
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,690
Lupus and kawasaki's are the most common
in a six-year-old.

130
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,490
Yeah, tough to find a six-year-old
who doesn't have lupusor kawasaki'S.

131
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,190
Did you look at her knees?

132
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,390
Those knobby things in the
middle of her legs.

133
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,590
Any scars or scabs?

134
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,690
- What does that have to do...
- most six-year-olds hurt themselves a lot.

135
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,390
The crash their bikes,
climb trees, bungee jump.

136
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,290
Dad said she doesn't like to run
around outside.

137
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,590
Because running around outside hurts.

138
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,590
She didn't mention anything about...

139
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,090
most six-year-olds are not familiar
with the phrase,"my joints feel inflamed."

140
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,790
So two plus two equals...

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,990
juvenile rheumatoidarthritis.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,590
We're checking her ana to confirm and
giving her steroids to fix her vision.

143
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,990
Some idiot gave me two tickets
for a play tonight.

144
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,190
Saved his life.
Apparently worth $186.

145
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,490
Sorry,I had to take a leak.

146
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,390
Oh, I...I didn't know
you were seeing a patient.

147
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,690
It's an exam room.
What did you think I was doing?

148
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,790
What you usually do--hiding from Cuddy.

149
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,190
Be stupid to do it in here.
There's a patient in here.

150
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,490
- You been drinking more?
- Uh, no, I...

151
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,990
guy's peeing all the time.

152
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,290
The play, interested?

153
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,690
Sure.You want me to pick you up?

154
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,690
I'm not going.You said two tickets.

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,890
You thought this was a date?

156
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,490
- Any other symptoms?
- My stomach hurts.

157
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,990
I have back pain and muscle aches.
I feel dizzy.

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,690
And I have trouble concentrating
sometimes in class.

159
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,490
I really should...

160
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,890
you want the tickets or not?

161
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,990
- Why don't you wanna go with me?
- It's a play.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,290
Dudes only go to plays
if they're dragged by women

163
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,690
they're hoping to see naked.

164
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,290
So why are you giving them to me?

165
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,290
Maybe there's someone you wanna see naked.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,790
I--

167
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,490
all right.

168
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,090
- Any fever?
- No.

169
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,690
- Anything in your pee other than pee?
- No.

170
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,290
- I'm gonna need a urine sample.
- No.

171
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,090
Yeah, that last one wasn't a question.

172
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,990
- You might have diabetes.
- I can't pee in public.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,590
We have bathrooms.

174
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,190
I can't pee in public bathrooms.

175
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,890
Where can you pee?

176
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,790
I only live a few miles from here.

177
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,890
I thought arthritis was for old people.

178
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,690
Jra's an autoimmune disease.

179
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,490
Her body's attacking itself,

180
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,290
causing inflammation in the joints,
her eyes,and her heart.

181
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,390
Is it treatable?

182
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,390
It can be crippling.

183
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,290
But it can also go into complete remission.

184
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,490
Well, the good thing is we caught it early.

185
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,190
Gives her the best chance to have
a positive outcome.

186
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,090
Da--

187
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,390
don't get up, goosey.

188
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,090
Your stitches.

189
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,690
She's having a stroke.

190
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,590
stroke was caused by a clot
in her middle cerebral artery.

191
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,890
Started her on tpa.

192
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,090
Should dissolve the clot and hopefully
prevent brain damage.

193
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,690
But we won't know for sure
until she regains consciousness.

194
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,590
Or she has another stroke.

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,190
Arthritis...heart disease.

196
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,790
- Why can't this  kid act her age?

197
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,390
Jra doesn't affect the blood.

198
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,990
Means the clot's a symptom of something else.

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,190
It's a symptom of polycythemia.
She's fully hydrated.

200
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,290
Her blood's still thicker
than pancake batter.

201
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,490
Thick blood explains the stroke.

202
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,690
Can also have caused an auto-immune response.

203
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,490
Which would explain the jra kicking into gear.

204
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,890
But what explains the thick blood?

205
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,590
Lack of oxygen forces the body
to over produce red cells.

206
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,990
What explains the lack of oxygen?

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,190
Carbon monoxide fumes,cigarette smoke.

208
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,490
I doubt our patient's a smoker.
Dad could be.

209
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,790
He's not.

210
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,490
- He says he's not.
- Hey!

211
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,390
Don't make me turn the hose on you two.

212
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,390
Chase is right.

213
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,290
You two go check the house.
See if dad's a closet marlboro man.

214
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,890
You're intentionally punishing us.

215
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,590
By making you do your job?
It does seem kind of cruel, doesn't it?

216
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,090
Take along a carbon monoxide detector
to check for leaks.

217
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,590
And you, start her on hydroxyurea
to control her red blood cell production.

218
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,590
Dig out a Merck manual,medieval edition,

219
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,490
tell you how to drain a pint or two
so she doesn't clot again.

220
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,090
Dr. Cameron!

221
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,490
I got you flowers.
For helping my sister.

222
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,290
That's so sweet.

223
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,590
- Does your dad know you're down here?
- Yes.

224
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,390
Congratulations on your bundle of joy.

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,590
Something you forgot to tell me?

226
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,090
You should take these back
to where you found them.

227
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,290
Okay.

228
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,290
Excuse me, can you make sure these flowers
and this kid get back to where they belong?

229
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,790
- Sure.
- Thanks.

230
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,390
Let's go.Come on.

231
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,690
Wait.

232
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,490
so you're just draining blood from her?

233
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,390
You're not testing it,you're not fixing it?

234
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,490
Your daughter's vascular system
is engorged with blood.

235
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,390
Draining some reduces
the chances of another stroke.

236
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,990
We're also starting her on a drug

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,390
that suppresses the production of red cells
so we don't have to keep doing this.

238
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,490
Good chance she'll make a full recovery.

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,790
- She hasn't spoken yet.
- Give her time.

240
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,590
this is your boy?

241
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,590
- Where have you been?
- Exploring.

242
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,790
- See ya.
- Thank you.

243
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,490
You know,you just can't run off
without telling me.

244
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,890
Okay.Can I have two dollars?

245
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,890
Oven's a long shot.They'd smell the gas
long before anyone got sick.

246
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,990
Yeah, right.House loves it when we skip
something because it's a long shot.

247
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,890
Why'd you take the flower?
Why'd you kiss him?

248
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,890
He did something sweet.

249
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,490
- He stole flowers.
- He's eight.

250
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,090
You were trying to make me jealous.

251
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,790
Yeah, I want you to profs your love for me.

252
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,190
Oh, wait,you already did that.

253
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,090
And it caused me to end our relationship.

254
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,190
You're enabling a thief.

255
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,090
And a delinquent.

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,490
Letters from school.

257
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,190
Fights, detentions,a parent conference.

258
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,890
Oh, I know, I know.

259
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,090
The bad boy is hard to resist.

260
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,890
It's a crush.It's harmless.

261
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,190
- It's never harmless.
- So I'm learning.

262
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,090
So this is us now?

263
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,890
We snipe at each other?

264
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,690
I'm not sniping,
I'm looking for a vent.

265
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,890
Her room's directly above the garage.

266
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,590
There's all sorts of CO sources down there.

267
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,590
I found a vent.

268
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,590
I think there's something in it.

269
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,690
This isn't right.

270
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,090
You dumped me.
You don't get to be mad.

271
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,390
We had a really good thing.

272
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,690
You broke the rules.I'm angry.

273
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,990
I'll get over it.

274
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,890
She's being abused.

275
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,890
a bloody t-shirt doesn't equal abuse.

276
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,190
Kids get hurt all the time.

277
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,290
That amount of blood?

278
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,490
Oh, crap.

279
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,590
You two are agreeing again.

280
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,190
Father's overwhelmed.Hectic job,
his wife passed away last year.

281
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,890
He could easily be taking it
out on the kids.

282
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,990
Or she had a nose bleed and
grabbed a t-shirt.

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,690
she's so ashamed of a nosebleed

284
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,190
she has to hide the evidence
in a vent under her bed.

285
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,090
She's socially isolated,
the brother's always in trouble.

286
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,090
It's classic signs.

287
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,390
But no physical signs.
No marks on her body.No bruises at all.

288
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,090
What if it's sexual?

289
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,090
We should call social services.

290
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,390
Well, this sucks.

291
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,390
Either it's abuse or it's not abuse.

292
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,890
Which means either it's a symptom
or it's completely irrelevant.

293
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,990
Either way,we gotta waste half a day
figuring out which.

294
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,790
Full physical exam.

295
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,190
Look for bruises we may have missed.

296
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,690
Check her mouth and do a vaginal exam.

297
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,390
We can't do a vaginal exam on a
six-year-old without the dad's consent.

298
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,890
And if he's abusing her,
he'll never say yes.

299
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,590
Never is just "reven" spelled backwards.

300
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,290
Have you been abusing your daughter?

301
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,690
What?Why would you...

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,290
we found this hidden in a vent under her bed.

303
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,590
I don't know anything about this.

304
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,090
Maybe she had a bloody nose.

305
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,690
We need to examine her for abuse.

306
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,790
You can't really think I...

307
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,290
maybe you,maybe the school bully,
maybe the creepy neighbor.

308
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,190
I'm guessing you're not paying as
much attention as you should be.

309
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,790
You even know where your son is right now?

310
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,790
Yeah, he was here just...here a minute ago.

311
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,990
She isn't being abused.

312
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,290
Unfortunately, that answer doesn't help me.

313
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,590
If you have abused her,
you're obviously gonna lie about it.

314
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,890
I'm not lying!

315
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,290
- We need to do a vaginal exam.
- No,

316
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,390
she may be dying,she still can't talk,
and you're gonna waste your time with this?

317
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,890
You consent,and we waste a
few hours doing the exam,

318
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,590
or you refuse and I call social services.

319
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,890
And they waste three days
doing the investigation

320
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,390
which ends with them doing the exam anyway.

321
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,990
I'm gonna look inside your mouth.
Open wide.

322
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,390
I need to look at your chest
and your back next, okay?

323
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,190
I know you can't talk so
stop me if you get scared.

324
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,590
Before you came here,
did anyone hurt you?

325
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,590
Make you bleed?

326
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,590
I need to look in your vagina now.
Do you understand?

327
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,490
I'm a doctor,so it's okay, all right?

328
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,090
Bend your knees,keep your ankles together.

329
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,490
And just let your knees fall
to the side, okay?

330
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,690
Oh, my god.

331
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,990
She has cuts all over her
genital area.Like slices.

332
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,090
Some are almost healed,but some are new.

333
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,290
She could be doing it to herself.

334
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,890
She's a little young to be cutting.

335
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,590
She's a little young for a stroke.

336
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,390
Depression accounts for the cuts.

337
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,090
Molestation accounts for the depression.

338
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,790
But do the cuts account for all that blood?

339
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,790
They weren't deep enough.

340
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,490
So she's getting cut,
but that's not the source of the blood?

341
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,790
The other obvious source is
forcible penetration.

342
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,590
Obvious source of the blood,not the cuts.

343
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,790
And there was no tearing.
There was no evidence at all.

344
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,390
So we have no explanation
for the cuts or the blood.

345
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,490
Where is he?

346
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,690
What if our original assumption was wrong?

347
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,990
Meaning what?

348
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,990
We found a t-shirt covered with blood
hidden in the heating vent.

349
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,590
How do we know it's even hers?

350
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,290
Her dad identified it.

351
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,890
Not the shirt, the blood.

352
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,690
- Are--are those the urine test results?
- Yes.

353
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,490
- And...
- I'm going to ask you for some blood.

354
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,190
Why?

355
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,190
To see if your answer will be,
I can't bleed in public.

356
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,990
This wasn't your urine,was it?

357
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,890
Why would I give you someone else's urine?

358
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,290
The usual reason is because
you're on steroids.

359
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,690
I'm not an athlete.

360
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,190
Second favorite reason
is because you're on drugs.

361
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,490
- I'm not.
- I am.

362
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,090
Third favorite reason is,
you have insurance,

363
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,390
but your friend eggs benedict doesn't.

364
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,190
So eggs describes a list of symptoms
and you repeat them to a doctor.

365
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,490
Which is particularly stupid
because this is a free clinic.

366
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,790
Need you.Now.

367
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,690
My work here is done.

368
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,690
Am I okay?Is it diabetes?

369
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,790
No, you're pregnant.

370
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,490
Six-year-old abuse victim
and you haven't called social services?

371
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,990
She might have been abused?
That's horrifying.

372
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,890
Why are you wearing extra concealer
under your eyes?

373
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,190
The law is clear.You suspect abuse,
you call the authorities.

374
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,990
You don't proceed as usual while the
possible abuser sits by her bedside.

375
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,090
Dad consented to the exam,
which means it's not the dad.

376
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,690
How late were you out last night?

377
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,390
It's always the dad.
And I don't have a curfew.

378
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,890
Panty hamster get a spin on its wheel?

379
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,690
I went to a play.

380
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,990
House, you are going back to your office.

381
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,890
You are picking up your phone,
calling social services,

382
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,990
and you are reporting suspected abuse.

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,590
Do you understand?

384
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,290
What play?

385
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,490
You're trying to have sex with Cuddy.

386
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,790
- Fries?
- You took her to a play.

387
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,790
You only take women to plays because--

388
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,190
no, you only take women to plays
for that reason.

389
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,090
That's your theory.

390
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,290
Okay,then why did you take her to a play?

391
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,690
- She's a friend.
- A friend with a squish mitten.

392
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,490
It is possible to have a friend
of the opposite sex.

393
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,890
Blasphemer!

394
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,090
She's not a friend of the opposite sex,
she's a different species.

395
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,290
She's an administrator.

396
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,990
She's gonna eat your head
after she's done.

397
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,090
Yes, I slept with her.

398
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,290
- Seriously?
- No.

399
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,990
Yes, you did.

400
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,590
Yes, I did.

401
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,590
Seriously?

402
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,490
No.You got a problem, House.

403
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,690
We just tested the blood on Lucy's t-shirt.

404
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,590
It's full of endometrial cells.

405
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,090
So it's not her blood.

406
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,790
We tested that too.It is.

407
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,790
Your six-year-old patient?

408
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,690
It's menstrual blood.

409
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,890
She's started puberty.

410
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,990
how can someone start puberty
before they even start the first grade?

411
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,090
She was in diapers two years ago.

412
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,090
For some reason, her body
has too much sex hormone.

413
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,790
Caused her reproductive system
to get confused.

414
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,590
Start operating prematurely.

415
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,690
We need to find out the source
of the hormones and cut it off.

416
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,490
She's so young.

417
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,290
I haven't even...talked to her about sex.

418
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,690
I doubt she even knows what a period is.

419
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,790
Girls talk to their moms about that.

420
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,390
You're going to be okay, goosey.

421
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,190
I love you.

422
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,990
I...

423
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,690
want...

424
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,990
juice.

425
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,390
She got her period
and didn't know what it was.

426
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,890
She was scared and confused.

427
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,290
Her friend told her to put a t-shirt
in her underwear.

428
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,890
When she started growing pubic hair,

429
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,390
she snuck daddy's razor and tried
to shave it off.

430
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,990
Apparently, forgot to sneak the
shaving cream.

431
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,390
Tumors, most likely.

432
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,090
A pituitary adenoma would send
her hormone level sky-high.

433
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,490
in Puerto Rico in the '70s,

434
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,890
there was an epidemic of kids growing
breasts because of estrogen in the poultry.

435
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,090
If it was in the food,
it would be an epidemic.

436
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,590
- We've got one kid.
- She's six.She's tiny.

437
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,390
She lives on chicken fingers and milk.

438
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,290
Dad doesn't look like the type to
read labels.

439
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,590
He's probably buying stuff
packed full of hormones.

440
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,290
Excellent argument.

441
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,290
It's a tumor.

442
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,590
There's all sorts of environmental sources:
Pesticides, soy products.

443
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,090
Some shampoos are basically a
placenta in a bottle.

444
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,290
If the tumor's not in her brain,
it's her reproductive tract.Get an M.R.I..

445
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,490
- Can I at least--
- waste your time?

446
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,290
Wouldn't recognize you if you didn't.

447
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,990
frontal cortex is clean.Moving caudally.

448
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,790
For the record,
Cameron's the one who broke it off.

449
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,090
Not interested.

450
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,490
No masses in the hypothalamus.

451
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,290
I wanted more.

452
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,290
She didn't share my feelings.

453
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,890
I feel like I'm in a similar position.

454
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,890
Pituitary's clean.

455
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,690
You're an idiot.

456
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,890
Either she's lying,
or she's actually emotionally detached.

457
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,890
Which one sounds more like Cameron to you?

458
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,090
Neither.

459
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,290
You have to choose one.

460
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,390
There's a bright spot on the left ovary.

461
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,190
Looks like a solid tumor.

462
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,990
They printed my letter.

463
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,490
You were right.

464
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,190
Of course I was.
What are we talking about?

465
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,090
- They printed my letter.
- Great.

466
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,990
Cuddy.

467
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,690
You wanna see her naked.

468
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,790
No, no, no.She wants to see me naked.

469
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,190
She sent me flowers.

470
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,190
She's just thanking you for the play.

471
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,090
See, some people feel
an emotion called gratitude--

472
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,990
- there's a card.
- I suspected.

473
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,990
Explains how you knew who they were from.

474
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,790
"Let's do it again...soon. XX, Lisa."

475
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,090
"X"s are the kisses, right?

476
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,890
No, I think they're the hugs.
The "O"s are the kisses.

477
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,490
No, no.The "X"s are definitely the kisses.

478
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,790
"Soon" is its own sentence.

479
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,790
I gotta go!

480
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,690
I'll miss you.

481
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,590
You were a good friend.

482
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,890
They printed my letter.

483
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,590
- How was the play,mrs. Lincoln?
- What's up with Wilson?

484
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,190
- He's just a little freaked.
- Why?

485
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,190
I sent him flowers.

486
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,390
Jasper, you' not supposed to be up here.

487
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,190
Is that other doctor your boyfriend?

488
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,690
No.

489
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,190
Your dad's probably looking for you.

490
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,790
He's got enough to worry about right now.

491
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,490
Do you like him?

492
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,990
He's a friend.

493
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,690
Do you like him like him?

494
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,390
We should get you back to your dad.

495
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,790
Let me put this down
and I'll take you there.

496
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,290
I could be your boyfriend.

497
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,190
I...

498
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,190
think that wouldn't be fair
to the girls in your own age.

499
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,890
He seems like a tool.

500
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,290
He's not.And that's rude.

501
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,390
I'm taking you back to your father.

502
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,990
Mass is small--about a centimeter across.

503
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,090
firing the biopsy needle.

504
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,790
- You nick an artery?
- No.

505
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,790
She's in v-tach;no pulse.

506
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,890
Charging 50.Clear!

507
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,990
Clear!

508
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,660
Clear!

509
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,790
Arrhythmia must've been a reaction
to the hydroxyurea.

510
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,990
We have to stop the drug therapy.

511
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,290
Her bone marrow will just go back
to over producing blood cells.

512
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,450
She'll keep having strokes,and
we'll have to keep bleeding her...forever.

513
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,790
We resect the tumor,hormone levels
go back to normal,her symptoms go away

514
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,470
Great plan...

515
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,060
except for the fact
that her tumor's not a tumor.

516
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,690
It's a benign cyst.

517
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,080
If it's not a tumor,
that just leaves an environmental source.

518
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,830
Feeling another late night.

519
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,240
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

520
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,610
-You're kidding me,right?
-What?

521
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,640
The answer's right there.
It's just a question of finding it.

522
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,380
You don't need me for that.

523
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,390
Don't get the Mochaccino.

524
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,500
They screwed up
and put hot chocolate in the dispenser.

525
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,940
-Thank you.
-You were right.

526
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,910
The eight-year-old kid grabbed my ass.

527
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,780
I shouldn't have encouraged him.

528
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,340
Well,I was a boy once.
I know how they think.

529
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,750
-You were a pervert at eight?
-Maybe 11.

530
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,940
I didn't realize you were gonna get hurt.

531
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,840
I'm sorry I misled you.

532
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,580
You didn't.

533
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,890
You have feelings for me.

534
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,220
You come back to me again and again.

535
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,480
For sex.
It's a simple,physical--

536
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,590
you have feelings for puppies
and patients that you barely know.

537
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,640
But when it comes to a guy
that you've worked with for three years,

538
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,360
had sex with,
spent the night with...

539
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,660
you're telling me you feel nothing?

540
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,480
Absolutely nothing?

541
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,800
Get away from her!
Don't touch her!

542
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,800
-I'll kill you if you touch her!
-Jasper!

543
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,140
Get him off!  Ah!
He's biting me! Get him off!

544
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,000
what is he gonna do?!

545
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,260
he stopped
and looked at him from the top rope.

546
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,220
But now he's scaling!

547
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,720
no way!

548
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,610
Somebody better be dying.

549
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,210
Lucy's big brother's got a crush on me
so he bit the crap out of Chase.

550
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,920
and I care because...?

551
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,890
Just thought you might wanna know

552
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,920
when one of your employees
gets attacked by a sociopath.

553
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,880
bees or monkeys,yes.
Sociopaths,no.

554
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,230
doesn't have sense
enough to know he wasn't pinned.

555
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,470
he's not a man. He is a monster!

556
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,800
no way!

557
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,510
we gotta take another look at this...

558
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,240
-Hello.
-He's not a sociopath.

559
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,620
How do you know?

560
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,480
he's acting logically.

561
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,220
He's got a crush on you.

562
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,560
He's being aggressive about it.

563
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,800
Not just regular aggressive...

564
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,350
he's out-of-his-mind on hormones aggressive.

565
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,660
-You think he's ....
-you better figure out what's killing the girl...

566
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,630
because her brother's got it too.

567
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,380
Jasper's got 100 times more testosterone
than a healthy,eight-year-old.

568
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:05,380
But we scanned his brain and reproductive tract--
no hormone-secreting tumors.

569
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,470
Not surprised.What's more likely?

570
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,680
Brother and sister get the same type of tumor
at exactly the same time

571
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,090
or they both play in the same toxic sandbox?

572
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,230
yes,you would think that if,for some reason,
you were completely unaware of

573
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,510
the fact we spent the entire night testing
everything from that home.

574
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,310
It was all negative.

575
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,440
You went home?

576
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,520
Good for you. Delegate.

577
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,510
We're not his subordinates.

578
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,740
Making it all the more impressive.

579
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,620
What if it's genetic?

580
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,350
Anyone else think it's more than
a coincidence these kids have symptoms

581
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:40,710
that could be caused by a brain tumor,
which is exactly what killed their mom?

582
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,630
you just said there were no tumors.
We scanned both their brains.

583
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,050
They looked clean.

584
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,580
So did their moms,until it didn'T.

585
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,910
It can't be genetic.

586
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,230
-Mom had none of the same symptoms.
-Yes,she did.

587
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,390
If the symptoms were pubic hair

588
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,280
-and menstruation...
-That's ridiculous.

589
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,940
If menstruation is a symptom of brain cancer,

590
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,600
than I should be on chemo right now.

591
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,560
That's ridiculous.
You're way too skinny to be menstruating.

592
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,420
what if the mom had other problems...

593
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,830
symptoms her doctors ignored on account of
the fact she was already dying?

594
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,360
Pull all her medical records.
Find any similarities to our patients.

595
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,160
Punch the little braton the nose
so he doesn't have a stroke like his sister

596
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,150
-I'm not sick.
-Just trying to keep you that way.

597
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,240
I want dr. Cameron to do mine.

598
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,550
Trust me.
You don't want her cutting you right now.

599
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,930
So...Jasper's behavioral issues...

600
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,990
could be a function of the increased
testosterone.

601
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,750
Hopefully,he'll be a delight
as soon as we figure this out.

602
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,980
My tummy hurts!
It hurts!

603
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,370
No,it doesn'T.
Don't be such a baby.

604
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,260
-My tummy hurts!
-Where in your tummy?

605
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,430
It hurts!It hurts!

606
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,640
Stomach pain is from a cyst in her pancreas.

607
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,350
I found two more in her kidneys
and one in her lung.

608
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,010
They weren't there 48 hours ago.

609
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,530
The hormones are making her body go haywire.

610
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,210
She gets one in her brain or heart,
she's dead.

611
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,570
No pressure though.

612
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,530
Mom was perfectly healthy
until she got cancer.

613
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,280
She had none of the symptoms the kids have.

614
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,590
It's not genetic.
It's not environmental.

615
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,040
It's gotta be a pituitary adenoma.

616
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,760
Yes,that would make complete sense
if we had one.

617
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,570
Just because we haven't found anything
on the scan doesn't mean it's not there

618
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,530
You should remove her pituitary gland.

619
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,870
Two siblings,same condition.

620
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,460
It's gotta be genetic or environmental.

621
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,850
We add in the same time
and we're back to just environmental.

622
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,140
yes,and that would make complete sense
if there was anything in her environment.

623
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,970
That's because we haven't found anything yet.

624
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:48,240
she's been out of her environment for four
days and she's still getting worse.

625
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,210
-I'm getting the father's consent.
-No!

626
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,310
We have no evidence.

627
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,730
This is your process, House.

628
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,350
You asked us what two plus two is.

629
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,790
We've eliminated every number except for four.

630
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,170
She needs brain surgery.

631
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,900
The ovaries produce sex hormones in response
to a signal from the pituitary gland

632
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,020
Since we know the ovaries are fine,
the most likely cause--

633
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:25,390
"most likely" means she wants to root around
inside your little girl's brain

634
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,340
without any guarantee that it'll work.

635
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,200
That's why she's holding off on doing your son.

636
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,190
Dr. House knows that unfortunately,
we've ruled out every other option.

637
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,390
-We need to resect Lucy's pituitary before--
-who else visits these kids?

638
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,500
-They don't have any family in town.
-You got a girlfriend?

639
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,160
No one visits.

640
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,670
-School?
-They don't go to the same school.House,I've--

641
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,120
-nanny?
-They don't have one.

642
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,000
They go to an after-school day care,
but none of the other kids are sick.

643
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,140
Yet.

644
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,810
It took your son twice as long
to develop symptoms as your daughter.

645
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,250
Maybe the other kids are just slow.

646
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,830
-We wait and your daughter may die.
-She does this,

647
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,580
your daughter will need hormone-replacement
therapy for the rest of her life

648
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,490
The treatments are extremely effective.

649
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,510
She should lead a relatively normal life.

650
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,370
And isn't that every parent's dream?

651
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,220
To have a kid grow up to be relatively normal?

652
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,890
My husband died of thyroid cancer
that metastasized to his brain.

653
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,710
I've been there.

654
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,780
I know how terrifying this can be.

655
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,930
I am telling you that this is your best
chance to save your daughter's life.

656
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:36,080
You did not just play the dead husband card.

657
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,580
My wife died

658
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,870
because she signed a consent form
that I didn't want her to sign.

659
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,880
Died.

660
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,720
Thank you.

661
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,730
How did you know?

662
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,970
Know what?

663
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,460
That the other kids weren't sick.

664
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,190
-You've been here for four days.
-I just--

665
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,680
I would've heard.

666
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,530
Right.

667
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,900
-Do you have hair on your special place?
-Miss Janie!

668
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,710
Can I help you?

669
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,410
I'm a doctor.

670
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,540
One of your kids are sick
and I need to know why.

671
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,400
You think they got sick here?

672
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,720
I think you're dating their dad.

673
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,230
He told you?

674
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,880
No...

675
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,790
and I don't really care why he didn't.

676
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,650
I just need to know how often you go to
their house and what you bring.

677
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,420
-I don't.
-Shampoos, fancy soaps?

678
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:59,600
-Kids get in your bag?
-I've never been to their house.

679
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,970
They just lost their mom.

680
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,440
And we thought it was too soon.

681
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,240
Why are you staring at me?

682
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,180
Lip wax?

683
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,920
I just had it done over lunch.

684
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,410
Mani-pedi?

685
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,370
No...just the wax.

686
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:27,300
Women get a wax,it's part of the
whole self-indulgent, beauty ritual.

687
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,470
pedicure, steam, cucumber masks.

688
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,190
No one runs out of lunch just
to get a lip wax,

689
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,360
unless you woke up looking like
Yosemite Sam.

690
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,220
You're an ass.

691
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,180
-Cameron.
-It's always the dad.

692
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,770
Excess facial hair in women.

693
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,520
It's a clear sign of hormonal imbalance.

694
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,130
Exactly what the little kiddies have.

695
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,720
Is there something wrong at the
day care center?

696
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,500
There's something wrong in your pants.

697
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,590
She's a lot younger than I am.

698
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,740
I...use A...

699
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,770
male-enhancement cream to keep up with her.
What does this have to do--

700
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,290
it never occurred to you to get a prescription
instead of some penis pumper loaded with testosterone?

701
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,750
I keep it at the gym.

702
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,590
I apply it daily in the shower
just like it says on the bottle.

703
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,560
It's never been in my home.
It's obviously never been near the kids.

704
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,240
-But you have.
-We been through that.

705
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,780
I'm not a pervert or a pedophile!

706
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,750
30% of our waste is excreted through our skin.

707
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,150
That sounds high.

708
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,690
That's why you stink after eating garlic.

709
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,520
Jack waters his bean stalk every day for a week.

710
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,840
He's oozing bean curd out of his pores for a month.

711
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,000
Every time you gave the little tykes a hug,

712
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,070
you gave them a dose of testosterone.

713
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,720
Small for you,

714
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,330
but more than their little bodies can handle.

715
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,280
So...I did this to them?

716
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,890
-Just...holding their hands?
-Uh-huh.

717
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,710
If I stop using it?

718
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,320
You'll be floppy,
they'll be fine.

719
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,590
-Give it back
-he'll still be eight.

720
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,780
-You okay?
-Yeah,I think so.

721
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,840
-Talk to Cuddy?
-No,not yet.I don't know what to say

722
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,540
Just be straight with her.

723
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,860
I'm not sure what that is.

724
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,670
I can't stop thinking about her.

725
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,210
In what way?

726
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,680
Maybe she's right.Maybe...

727
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,880
Maybe this is worth exploring.

728
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,420
-Are you sure that she feels--
-she sent me flowers.

729
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,030
How do i do this?
What do I say?

730
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,260
Cameron would tell you to say how you feel.

731
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,310
Me,I'd get her drunk.

732
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,930
I'm not gonna say anything.

733
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,910
I'm just gonna walk...into her office

734
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,180
and I'm gonna kiss her.

735
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,870
That's A...bold move.

736
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,030
Cuddy likes bold.

737
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,710
Yeah,you're right.If you spoke,
you'd say something stupid.

738
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,720
Yeah,I mean,
I'll either get a girlfriend or get fired.

739
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,000
Okay.

740
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,230
Yeah, okay. Okay.

741
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,120
All right.

742
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,440
You!
You...you!

743
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,190
You were gonna let me do that?!

744
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,530
You made a compelling argument.

745
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:29,170
-You sent those flowers to me!
-Yes, because you took her to a play.

746
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,050
Because actually you do want
to march down there and kiss her.

747
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,520
-No, I don't!
-Yes, you do!

748
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,980
You're right.

749
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,730
-Seriously?
-No.

750
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,540
You're a jerk.

751
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,930
-Night,wilson.
-Night,house.

752
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,040
They're beautiful.

753
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,160
I thought about what you said.

754
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,690
And I really don't want a relationship with you.

755
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,320
I know.

756
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,880
I also know you like flowers.

757
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,540
I don't get the whole may-december thing.

758
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,990
Give him a break.
It's may-october at worst.

759
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,800
Well,why can't it be october-october?

760
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,450
May is when things start to get hot.

761
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,140
If that guy wasn't trying so hard
to keep up with a woman half his age,

762
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,390
he wouldn't have almost killed both his kids.

763
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,300
Guy gets a little something-something...
couple of kids have to die...circle of life.

764
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,140
So many people.

765
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,880
So much energy and drama
just trying to find someone

766
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,610
who's almost never the right person anyway

767
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:41,510
It just...shouldn't be so hard.

768
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,030
I got tickets to a play.
