1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,580
Wait. Wait, we shouldn't...  
we shouldn't be doing this. 

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,070
What, you're not having fun ? 

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,630
It's not that. It's just... 

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,880
rather be with the boys ? 

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,600
No. 

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,860
Well, then, come on. 

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,970
You kids need any help ? 

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,360
No. No, we're fine. 

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,670
- Car trouble ? 
- No. 

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,150
Then why are you here ? 

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,690
Um... we're just talking. 

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,230
Does she do all the talking ? 

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,810
Uh, most of it. 

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,790
I know what that's like. 

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,450
I'm gonna come back through 
here in ten minutes. 

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,800
And if you're still here,
I'm gonna call your parents. 

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,340
Yes, sir. Thank you. 

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,620
Now, where were we ? 

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,870
Uh, we were going. 

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,320
In nine minutes. 

21
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,090
Wait a minute. 

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,090
Stevie ?  What's wrong ? 

23
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,430
Oh, my god ! 

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,120
Help ! Someone help me !

"House. M. D"

30
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,910
16-year-old with respiratory arrest. 

31
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,980
The only thing I hate more than 
a thief is a crippled thief. 

32
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,920
Yeah, me too. No sign of trauma. 
No history of asthma or allerg...

33
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,130
- Who the hell is J. Whitner ? 
- No idea. 

34
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,050
Stevie lipa's ekg and 
echocardiogram were normal, but...

35
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,490
Normal is good. Send him home. 

36
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,370
J. Whitner ! Doctor. 

37
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,760
Who is he and where do I find him ? 

38
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,920
She's a new researcher, 
works with ereshevsky. 

39
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,740
Is she hot ? 

40
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,790
She's in a wheelchair. 

41
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,990
Doesn't mean she's not hot. 

42
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,760
Just means she can't bend over, so Cuddy 
has to bend over backwards. 

43
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,220
16-year-old kid. E. R. Work-up revealed 
a bloody pleural effusion. 

44
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,010
That's odd. 

45
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,980
Yeah, that occurred to me. 

46
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,990
What took you so long to mention it ? 

47
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,970
No tumors or pneumonia on the ct. 

48
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,270
He passed out while making out. 

49
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,100
If he's into sex, drug and rock and roll 
can't be that far behind...

50
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,580
I'm guessing cocaine. 

51
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,780
Tox screen was clean. 

52
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,270
Just means he wasn't on drugs,
not that he hasn't been using drugs. 

53
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,050
Looks like a plumbing problem to me. 

54
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,300
Leaky pipes. 

55
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,550
If he popped an aneurysm,
he'd be in the morgue, not the E. R. 

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,280
That's why you're gonna do a venogram 
instead of an arteriogram. 

57
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,610
This is not a high-pressure burst... 
it's a low-pressure leak. 

58
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,480
Still could have been drugs that caused
the pipes to corrode in the first place. 

59
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,920
So go look under his mattress. 

60
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,510
See if he's got any pills or powder 
stashed with the hand lotion. 

61
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,270
Sweet ride. 

62
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,140
I asked for the one with the sissy
bar and the banana seat,

63
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,350
but santa gave me this instead. 

64
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,790
Guess that's what I get for being naughty. 

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,850
You must be Dr.House. 

66
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,430
Yeah. 

67
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,540
So, looks like there's been some sort 
of mix-up at the parking office. 

68
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,410
They had to move me closer to the door. 

69
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,630
Had to ? You don't look like 
the type to pull a weapon. 

70
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,260
- Wheelchair. 
- Cane. 

71
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,550
I think you should do the honorable thing, 
let me have my space back. 

72
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,340
Oh, well, uh, since you asked 
so nicely... wheelchair. 

73
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,160
Cane ! Walking long distances
 makes my leg hurt. 

74
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,840
And it's easy for me ? 

75
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,900
'Course not. 

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,970
Pushing that little lever, 
your thumb muscles must burn. 

77
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,550
I'm sure the last ten yards are pure torture. 

78
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,760
Crossing the parking lot's dangerous... 
cars can't see me. 

79
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,200
Did you ever hit 
a patch of black ice with a cane ? 

80
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,980
No, gosh, on account of the 
fact that I can't walk ! 

81
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,910
Maybe you should ask the parking 
office for some crampons. 

82
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,980
Look, this is about who can most 
easily cross the parking lot. 

83
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,050
You're the winner. 

84
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,510
Oh, and the prize is apparently 
a parking space. 

85
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,480
there's still no answer at either 
one of your parents' cell numbers. 

86
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,920
Is there any other way 
we might be able to contact them ? 

87
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,820
No. They're in a conference. 

88
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,800
They probably had to turn 
them off or something. 

89
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,240
What does it matter where they are ? 

90
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,070
I mean, he's in pain. 
You gotta do something. 

91
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,440
We need them to sign this. 

92
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,740
Why can't he just sign the papers ? 

93
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,130
- He's 16. 
- Still not an adult. 

94
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,990
Then call my parents. 

95
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,950
They know him. 

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,870
They'll take responsibility, 
do whatever you need. 

97
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,790
I can'T. It won't...

98
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,570
You can't just let him sit here in agony 
until his parents finally decide...

99
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,590
leah. It's okay. 

100
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,180
No, it's not. 

101
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,810
I feel like there's an anvil 
sitting on my chest. 

102
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,620
You win. 

103
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,920
We're doing the venogram now. 

104
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,030
We'll deal with the fall out later. 

105
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,220
My fingers feel wet. 

106
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,640
That's just the dye. 

107
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,940
Your nerves can't tell 
the difference between the cold inside

108
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,530
your body and the wet outside your body. 

109
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,020
The nerves can't tell the difference, 
or the brain can't interpret the difference ? 

110
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,810
It's a little of both. 

111
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,870
You like science ? 

112
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,280
It looks like a diffusion pattern. 

113
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,910
That's because it's the venous side, 
low pressure. 

114
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,550
So Graham's law applies ? 

115
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,750
You've taken physics al ready ? 

116
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,620
No. Just sort of read up on my own. 

117
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,400
I had to teach myself a lot of stuff too. 

118
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,410
Schools sucked where I grew up. 

119
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,570
You go to public or private ? 

120
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,490
Public. 

121
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,550
Leak has to be in the pulmonary 
veins to get in my lungs, right ? 

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,600
- Yep. 
- I don't see anything. Do you ? 

123
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,840
No. It doesn't make sense. 

124
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,240
How can I have a bloo effusion 
without any bleeding ? 

125
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,520
This is putrid. 

126
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,590
Put food-borne parasites and 
infections on the list to check on. 

127
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,610
I'll take the bedroom. 

128
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,750
I'm sorry, I didn't know there 
was anyone... we were just...

129
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,910
I have a gun. 

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,350
Look, you can take whatever you want. 

131
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,050
- My wallet's in my suit. 
- Freeze ! 

132
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,640
Oh ! I'm calling the cops. 

133
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,090
Okay, you don't have a gun. 

134
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,630
And you're not calling the cops. 

135
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,460
Oh, no, I'm calling the cops, unless you 
two get out of here right now. 

136
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,940
Unless ? 

137
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,440
Who calls the cops unless 
a burglar does something ? 

138
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,750
You don't want to have 
to explain the affair. 

139
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,880
We're not having an affair. 

140
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,790
He's got a ring. You don'T. 

141
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,850
And judging from the state 
of the kitchen downstairs

142
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,300
and the half-vacuumed bedroom,

143
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,220
I'm guessing you're a better 
lover than you are a maid. 

144
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,990
Maid ? 

145
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,480
You son of a bitch. 

146
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,470
I'm not a maid, okay ? 

147
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,530
This is my house, not his. 

148
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,500
Oh, sorry. 

149
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,940
And what's wrong with my kitchen ? 

150
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,890
Nothing. We're sorry. 

151
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,240
We're just here to help Stevie. 

152
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,970
Who's Stevie ? 

153
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,670
Your... son ? 

154
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,680
Huh ? 

155
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,500
it was the address you gave. 

156
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,060
The E. R. Must have written it down wrong. 

157
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,360
Or you lied because you don't 
want us to talk to your parents. 

158
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,000
I gave you their phone numbers. 

159
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,440
You gave us some numbers. 

160
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,730
We haven't been able to reach anyone. 

161
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,410
I told you, they must be in a conference. 

162
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,290
He's lying. 

163
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,920
Leah. 

164
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,930
He's romani. 

165
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,040
A gypsy. 

166
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,820
So you don't have a home ? 

167
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,380
Of course we do. 

168
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,470
Next you're gonna ask me about dancing 
around campfires and... Stealing children ? 

169
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,200
This is why I don't tell people. 

170
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,740
They share everything with each other 
and nothing with the gadje... the outsiders. 

171
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,910
Sharing information with outsiders 
has not gone so well for my people. 

172
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,310
I get it, but right now you're making 
yourself more vulnerable by lying to us. 

173
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,420
You can't go to my house. 

174
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,720
You'll pollute it. 

175
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,960
All we're gonna do is look around. 

176
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,170
Your presence is enough. 

177
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,090
My parents take it seriously. 

178
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,930
It's spiritual as much as it is physical. 

179
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,080
You know where he lives ? 

180
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,570
Don't. 

181
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,580
Look, I'll tell you whatever 
you need to know. 

182
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,840
If we can't trust your answers... 
I drink sometimes, okay ? 

183
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,230
I've smoked pot. 

184
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,670
I'll tell you anything. 

185
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,980
The truth. 

186
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,050
You just... You can't go in my home. 

187
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,310
The pot wouldn't cause a bleeding problem. 

188
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,270
A pesticide on the pot could. 

189
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,330
Where did you get it ? 

190
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,410
Some kid at school. 

191
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,760
Stevie. He got the pot from me. 

192
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,910
He doesn even go to school. 

193
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,830
His parents made him drop out. 

194
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,930
I'm home schooled. 

195
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,090
He reads books. 

196
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,570
What else are you lying about ? 

197
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,020
Is your father really a professor ? 

198
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,550
He's a salesman. 

199
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,000
They buy and sell anything 
they can get their hands on. 

200
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,630
They... so you're with your dad 
when he's making these deals ? 

201
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,030
He was just in chicagoa week ago. 

202
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,890
You fly ? 

203
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,720
No. My dad's got a truck. 

204
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,330
You can't be serious. 

205
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,320
Actually, I can. 

206
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,470
See ? It's my space. I want it back. 

207
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,630
It's not your space. 

208
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,120
It's the hospital's space. 

209
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,190
And the hospital thinks that the person 
who's worse off should get the better space. 

210
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,400
Your application for a handicapped space 
says you can walk 50 yards. 

211
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,750
And whitner says she can roll 
50 miles between oil changes. 

212
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,230
I can't change my leg. 

213
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,690
The space I moved you to is only 46 
yardsaway from the front door. 

214
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,970
I measured. You'll be fine. 

215
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,540
Great... so I can collapse four yards 
into the lobby instead of outside in the cold. 

216
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,840
As long as it's not in my office. 

217
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,860
You know who won the New York 
city marathon six years in a row ? 

218
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,530
Guy in a wheelchair. 

219
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,500
Then go get yourself 
one and leave me alone. 

220
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,350
Gimme my space, I'll be 
happy to roll around all day. 

221
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,870
You couldn't last one week in a wheelchair. 

222
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,640
Wanna bet ? 

223
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,760
What's wrong with you ? 

224
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,210
Nothing that a week off my feet won't solve. 

225
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,020
Venogram's negative. No leak. 

226
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,110
You mean you couldn't find the leak. 

227
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,030
Is your leg worse ? 

228
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,570
No, but my parking spot is. 

229
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,300
Blood is only made inside 
the circulatory system,

230
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,550
which means when we find it outside...

231
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,130
there's no leak. I even checked lymphatics. 

232
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,480
So you're gonna spend 
a weekin a wheelchair

233
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,440
just to get a parking space 
closer to the front door ? 

234
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,150
Easier than chopping off my legs. 

235
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,500
We've ruled out toxins and drugs. 

236
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,220
Kind of. He's romani. 

237
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,380
Apparently, they feel 
the need to keep secrets,

238
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,130
so it's hard to know anything for sure. 

239
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,710
Yeah, he's also a human being,

240
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,680
which means you shouldn't be 
trusting him to begin with. 

241
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,010
Stop relying on his answers 
and find some on your own. 

242
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,270
It's a deep veinthrombosis. 

243
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,420
The kid spent 16 hours 
in the backseat of an old pickup. 

244
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,440
Causes a clot and makes 
its way to his lungs. 

245
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,880
We should do an arteriogram,
find the clot, bust it with tpa. 

246
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,030
Or we could find the leak. 

247
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,570
There's no leak. 

248
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,230
Hey, you can't yell 
at a guy in a wheelchair. 

249
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,530
It's a slow leak. 

250
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,880
You gotta speed it up. 

251
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,580
Thin his blood. Redo the venogram. 

252
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,210
That could cause a massive bleed. 

253
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,850
Excellent... massive'll 
be even easier to find. 

254
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,340
Pardon me. 

255
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,780
Guess you guys are gonna 
have to get the next one. 

256
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,570
I thought you were 
redoing the venogram. 

257
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,180
As soon as we're done with the arteriogram. 

258
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,650
Okay, you're gonna feel a little poke. 

259
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,680
Could you maybe do that ? 

260
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,950
Don't worry. It's just your leg. 

261
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,440
I don't have to go any further than this. 

262
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,020
Take a look at this. 

263
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,650
Bones of your Forearm. 

264
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,430
Uh, radius and ulna. 

265
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,680
How 'bout the wrist ? 

266
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:11,200
Um... lunate... hamate... the... 

267
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,430
scared lovers try positions 
they can't handle. 

268
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,050
It's a mnemonic for the wrist bones. 

269
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,260
It's the only way I can remember them. 

270
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,310
Are you okay ? 

271
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,690
Ow. Ow, my stomach. 

272
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,790
You hit something ? 

273
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,290
- I barely started. 
- Lie flat. 

274
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,900
No, I can't. It hurts too much. 

275
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,820
I'm getting out. 

276
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,160
It's our only chance to see what's going on. 

277
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,950
If he moves, I could shred his artery. 

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,930
Just get it out ! Now ! 

279
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,030
It's gonna be okay, Stevie. 

280
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,000
Just inject the dye. 

281
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,970
Dye's going into his liver,
but it's not coming out. 

282
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,180
The clot's gonna be constricting 
the flow in the hepatic vein. 

283
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,280
It's not constricting it. 

284
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,560
It's completely blocking it. 

285
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,720
His whole liver's fried. 

286
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,840
kid's liver's failing because of massive 
clots blocking his hepatic vein. 

287
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,620
How can he have both a bleed and a clot ? 

288
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,350
It's not a clot. 

289
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,180
Must have blocked a vein 
with a catheter wire. 

290
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,190
Not a chance. 

291
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,230
Increased pressure downstream 
could also stop the blood. 

292
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,670
there's no heart failure or cirrhosis. 

293
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,680
Means it has to be a clot. 

294
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,450
Massive clots block veins. 

295
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,420
They don't make them leak. 

296
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,070
And since he clearly has some kind of...

297
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,360
you having a little problem ? 

298
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,230
Would you mind ? 

299
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,920
Boy, that was humiliating. 

300
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,550
How does whitner make it through the day ? 

301
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,900
"Pride goeth before the fall. 

302
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,670
"Lucky for me, I'm sittingin 
one of these babies. 

303
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,590
So, what other theories can I shoot down ? 

304
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,970
Dic would explain both...

305
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,210
his platelets are normal 
and his ptt isn't elevated. 

306
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:49,890
Leukemia ? 

307
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,140
Normal cbc and differential. 

308
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,540
You guys are still thinking like doctors 
when you should be thinking like plumbers. 

309
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,740
Come on, I wanna see some butt crack. 

310
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,520
Something inside the liver 
is punching holes in the pipes. 

311
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,400
Blood bleeds through the opening, 
sticks to the intruder,forms a mass. 

312
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,020
- A clot. 
- A mass. 

313
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,180
cancer. A tumor could erode a blood vessel. 

314
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,960
Well, so could a granuloma 
from tuberculosisor sarcoidosis. 

315
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,120
Do a ct, mri, a sputum, and an ace level. 

316
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,750
Excuse me, sorry. 

317
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,860
Cripple coming through. 

318
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,380
He says his throat hurts. 

319
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,060
That phrasing means you think it doesn't. 

320
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,080
No, I don't. 

321
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,810
Good enough for me. 

322
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,750
Where are you going ? 

323
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,100
Mothers know best. 

324
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,020
Get yourself a sucker on the way out. 

325
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,030
Look, I think he's just faking 
so he doesn't have to go to school. 

326
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,190
How did you know I was a truant officer ? 

327
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,160
I told him he had a choice... 
go to school or the doctor. 

328
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,180
Right... he's wasting your precious time, 
so you decided to waste mine. 

329
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,960
How thoughtful. 

330
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,890
I'm in a wheelchair, so I can't 
examine him all the way up there. 

331
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,660
Hop down. 

332
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,350
My life is just one horror after another. 

333
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,120
Open. 

334
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,260
Does it look like it hurts ? 

335
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,450
Nope. 

336
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,360
- What's that ? 
- It's a syringe. 

337
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,950
I'm with you--make him hate the doctor's 
office more than he hates school. 

338
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,670
That's okay. 

339
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,240
I don't... I don't think that's...

340
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:29,400
it's just saline... hurts like hell 
when it's injected directly into the muscle. 

341
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,760
So what do you think ? Arm or ass ? 

342
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,150
I think he's learned his lesson. 

343
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,450
Oh, I don't know. 

344
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,840
We better check. 

345
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,480
Jack, is your mommy a big fat idiot ? 

346
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,410
Well, what do you know ? 

347
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,470
Guess you were right. 

348
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,100
Just hold still, Stevie. 

349
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,110
This shouldn't take long. 

350
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,950
Sorry, i'm guessing the mike 
in this thing doesn't pick up nods. 

351
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,240
Smart kid. 

352
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,970
Too bad it's all gonna go to waste. 

353
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,460
Nothing wrong with being a salesman. 

354
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,140
He should be able to pursue his own life,

355
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,720
not be stuck helping his parents 
sell old toasters. 

356
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,120
He's still young... 
you never know what he'll end up doing. 

357
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,690
Unless he goes back to school, 
I know exactlywhat he'll end up doing. 

358
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,180
Wait. 

359
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,670
Is that a lesion ? 

360
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,390
Magnifying times five. 

361
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,550
It's a granuloma. 

362
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,800
Means wegener's is most likely. 

363
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,270
Stevie ! 

364
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,310
Mom, is that you ? 

365
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,270
Hey, hey ! 

366
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,420
Get him out of this now ! 

367
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,240
Your son is sick. 

368
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,060
The sign on the door...

369
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,070
No, the sign says no metal. 

370
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,940
We took everything off. 

371
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,050
It says no admittance. 

372
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,240
What's wrong with our son ? 

373
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,020
We don't know yet. 

374
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,170
He's not gonna die, is he ? 

375
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,860
Your son is very ill. 

376
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,110
We're still trying to figure out why,

377
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,500
which is why we need you to leave the room. 

378
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,100
what are you going to do now ? 

379
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,180
Oh, now I've gotta slide my butt 
from one padded seat to another. 

380
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,340
What if I bump my knee ? 

381
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,790
Mri showed a granulomain his liver. 

382
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,620
Fantastic. 

383
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,530
Wanna give me a hand here ? 

384
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,750
No... clotting, bleeding, 
and a granuloma equals wegener's. 

385
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,810
I know. That's why I said fantastic. 

386
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,820
I was being sincere. 

387
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,830
Now give me a hand. 

388
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,940
It wouldn't be fair. 

389
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,520
We're gonna biopsy the liver to confirm. 

390
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,910
Wouldn't be fair not to. 

391
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,890
People are good and kind and gentle 
and help people in wheelchairs. 

392
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,900
You don't believe that. 

393
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,330
- But you do. 
- No, I don't. 

394
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,430
Foreman. 

395
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,590
Forget the biopsy. 

396
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,410
His liver'll be gone before 
you get the results. 

397
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,050
Start treatment with cyclophosphamide 
before wegener's punches a hole in another pipe. 

398
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,480
What's with the clothes ? 

399
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,420
You're not being discharged. 

400
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,720
I know. It... it's my parents. 

401
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,920
They insist that I wear this stuff. 

402
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,700
We insist on our own food,gown, 
and furnishings for a reason. 

403
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,000
Hey, my... my chest burns. 

404
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,820
Are you sure the treatments are working ? 

405
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,080
Wegener's causes the body to attack itself. 

406
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,630
It doesn't get undone overnight. 

407
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,630
Be patient. 

408
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,450
Where's your soup ? 

409
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,100
It's in the garbage. 

410
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,350
It has willow bark extract. 

411
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,470
Willow bark extract is basically aspirin. 

412
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,960
Yes, for the fever. 

413
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,020
He's already on meds... our meds. 

414
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,850
We can't risk any adverse interactions. 

415
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,050
We need all this stuff to go. 

416
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,380
We need to control this environment. 

417
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,260
So do we. 

418
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,040
People get sick for a reason. 

419
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,620
'Cause something in their 
life is out of balance. 

420
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,390
Dad, he's a doctor. 

421
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,790
He doesn't want to hear your talk. 

422
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,810
Balance is just starting to be restored 
now that that girl is gone. 

423
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,300
That girl took pretty good care 
of your son while you were away. 

424
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,600
Yes, we can see that. 

425
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,670
All this stuff may make 
him feel more comfortable,

426
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
- But it's not...
- How long is this treatment gonna take ? 

427
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,130
We should start to see some improvement 
in his liver function soon. 

428
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,200
"Soon. "Very scientific. 

429
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,290
I'm sorry. 

430
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,380
Be back in a little bit to check on you. 

431
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,490
ah, yes. 

432
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,200
If it isn't dr. Ironside. 

433
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,870
Ah, if isn't "Dr. 

434
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,450
I had no friends when I was growing up,

435
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,370
"so all I did was watch tv by myself,

436
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,810
"which is why I can now make 
constant pop culture references

437
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,870
which no one understands but me. 

438
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,320
" That's my name.  Don't wear it out. "

439
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:55,500
Ah, ah. Safe from Cuddy, but I guess not 
from her trusted rat-complice. 

440
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:59,000
Reasonable people don't debate 
the relative merits of their handicaps. 

441
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,870
Reasonable people make 
rules based on evidence...

442
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,540
like difficulty covering 
a distance, say 50 yards,

443
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,040
not on some pre-ordained 
pathetic-ness scale. 

444
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,070
Last I checked, pigheadedness 
was not the eighth heavenly virtue. 

445
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,460
It's only pigheaded if you're wrong. 

446
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,340
If you're right, they call 
it sticking to your principles. 

447
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,120
Give it up. You're demeaning yourself. 

448
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,720
That's what they told rosa parks. 

449
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,570
Don't stand up in there. 

450
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,770
I'm watching your feet. 

451
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,930
Get out of our home. 

452
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,270
This is not a home. 

453
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:25,960
It's certainly not...

454
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,590
It's our home as long 
as our son is here. 

455
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,970
Mom, dad, will you just 
please just calm down ? 

456
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,030
You're not family. 

457
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,130
You have no right to be here. 

458
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,620
What are you gonna do,throw me out ? 

459
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,810
You can't even touch the gadje. 

460
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,870
I'll touch you. 

461
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,980
What is going on ? 

462
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,030
I'm the one who brought him here. 

463
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,760
I should be able to see how he's doing. 

464
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,960
He wouldn't even need to be 
here if it weren't for you. 

465
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,890
Right... I'm so unclean, I caused 
his liver to shut down. 

466
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,970
Enough. 

467
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,030
No one is leaving. 

468
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,120
He's our son, and we 
want her out of here. 

469
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,600
It hurts. 

470
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,230
Your stomach again ? 

471
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,010
No. What ? 

472
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,970
his liver's actually improving. 

473
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,320
We plug one hole and end up poking another. 

474
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,860
We talking about the patient 
or how to get a raise from Cuddy ? 

475
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,780
The wegener's treatment gave him a 
massive hemorrhagein his bladder. 

476
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,750
Which means... 

477
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,750
It's wegener's. 

478
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,670
What did I just say ? 

479
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,920
We were treating him for wegener's 
when eveverything went wrong. 

480
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,740
Not everything. 

481
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,470
Yeah, it was a very lovely day outside. 

482
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,010
On the other hand,
the treatment made him worse. 

483
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,220
Treatment made his bladder 
worse, not his liver. 

484
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,700
Clot in the liver's breaking up. 

485
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,550
And the mri, sputum, and 
ace ruled out tb, sarcoidosis,

486
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,370
and lymphoma, which leaves us with... 

487
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,770
still could be a cancer with multiple...

488
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,410
A cancer we can't see on mri, 
ct, or blood tests ? 

489
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,530
It's wegener's. 

490
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,120
It's not the wrong diagnosis. 

491
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,220
It's the wrong treatment. 

492
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,900
We could increase immuno suppression. 

493
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,750
Add methotrexate. 

494
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,290
we can't give methotrexate to a kid who's 
already had lung problems. 

495
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,470
Methotrexateis carpet bombing. 

496
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,340
Hits everything. 

497
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,120
We need a smart bomb. 

498
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,810
So we don't suppress the 
immune system... we change it. 

499
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,360
Immune modulation. 

500
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,750
Ft-28. 

501
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,100
His antibodies are attacking 
his blood vessels. 

502
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,400
The irritation causes 
them to bleed and clot. 

503
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,940
We change his immune system 
so the antibodies don't interact

504
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,470
with his blood vessels but 
work fine everywhere else. 

505
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,910
Ft-28's still experimental. 

506
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,400
It's not fda-approved. 

507
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,090
It's worked for crohn's disease 
and rheumatoid arthritis. 

508
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,720
He doesn't have crohn's or arthritis. 

509
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,710
Let's say that he does... 

510
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,680
and start the treatment. 

511
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,010
absolutely not. 

512
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,660
My people have been experimented 
on before. Never again. 

513
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,770
Mr. Lipa, with all due respect,

514
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,690
comparing this hospitalto 
auschwitz is ridiculous. 

515
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,190
Ft-28's been proven safe in hundreds...

516
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,720
People always say you can trust them. 

517
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,870
Why would they say anything else ? 

518
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,850
Why do they think we would listen...

519
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,150
Hey, hey, hey. You think I don't 
understand what it's like to

520
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,020
come from a people who've been 
enslaved, mistreated,

521
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,070
and experimented on ? 

522
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,100
Tuskegee went on for 28 years 
after world war II. 

523
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,500
And the laws that made it illegal 
for the romani to even set foot

524
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,520
in this state were still 
on the books until 1998. 

525
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,960
It's not ancient history. 

526
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,930
Conventional therapy hasn't worked. 

527
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,320
Your son may be dying. 

528
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,820
He needs a targeted approach,
and you need to trust us. 

529
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,460
I'm sorry. 

530
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,720
A life time of experiences 
tells me I can't trust you. 

531
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,210
And the past three days have 
done nothing to change that. 

532
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,610
We want our son treated,
not experimented on. 

533
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,480
If you don't know how to do that, 
then just tell us

534
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,220
so we can take him someplace 
where they do. 

535
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,480
they're absolutely right. 

536
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,590
Stay away from that unproven, 
experimental stuff. 

537
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,750
Much better to stick with the "moving 
of furniture until he gets better" approach. 

538
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,620
Yes, you're right. 

539
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,070
We're gonna have to come up 
with something else. 

540
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,500
You mean another 
last-ditch desperation move ? 

541
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,150
You got anything ? 

542
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,160
Go back and don't take no for an answer. 

543
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,550
What kind a salesman are you ? 

544
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,960
The kind who avoids the house with the crazy 
couple who put tinfoil over their windows. 

545
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,550
They got money for tinfoil, they got money 
for whatever you're selling. 

546
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,270
What's that mean ? 

547
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,440
Means that if they don't trust you, 
you should earn that lack of trust. 

548
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,400
What does paying for tinfoil mean ? 

549
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,090
Why should I have to answer 
all the questions ? 

550
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,540
Oops. Sorry. 

551
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,180
Still getting used 
to the power steering. 

552
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,660
I assume you've heard the news ? 

553
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,790
I'm not worried. 

554
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,060
From what I hear,what you lack in shame 
you also lack in will power. 

555
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,370
My will may be weak, 
but my backbone is strong. 

556
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,240
And pain-free, now that 
I've stopped using the cane. 

557
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,640
'Course, it's harder 
to look down cuddy's shirt. 

558
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,990
Then, the vantage point 
on her ass is much improved. 

559
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,340
That's just me... alwayslooking 
on the bright side. 

560
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,500
I'm the guy who said that 
her c cups are half-full. 

561
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,420
They are nice, aren't they ? 

562
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,340
Oh... no. 

563
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,180
You're not gonna win me over that easily. 

564
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,240
You may have a wheel. 

565
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,870
It doesn't mean you get the grease. 

566
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,050
You gotta squeak. 

567
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,880
What's that ? 

568
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,510
Cyclophosphamide. 

569
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,860
We're continuing the standard 
treatment as you requested. 

570
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,650
Uh, I have to ask everyone to leave 
the room for a few minutes

571
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,190
while I apply some bandages. 

572
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,010
Why do we have to leave ? 

573
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,410
For his penis. 

574
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,610
You lied to them. 

575
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,570
The bleeding stopped. 

576
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,940
I don't need any bandages. 

577
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,440
We need to changeyour treatment, 
but your parentswon't let us. 

578
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,970
They've got it in their 
minds that we want to try

579
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,480
some sort of inhuman experiment on you. 

580
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,210
The treatment's experimental ? 

581
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,840
Ft-28's been through extensive clinical trials. 

582
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,810
It's also been used successfully 
for other conditions. 

583
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,160
The fact that you're recommending... 

584
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,890
experimental treatment means 
you haveno other options ? 

585
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,050
Sorry. 

586
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,870
We stop the pleural effusions,
your liver almost fails. 

587
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,790
We save your liver, the bladder fails. 

588
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,120
If we don't get ahead of the curve on this...

589
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,040
What do you need me to do ? 

590
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,750
Take the medicine,but don't ll your parents. 

591
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,700
I don't like lyingto my parents. 

592
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,520
The rest of the world,though...

593
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,200
the rest of the world can't trust. 

594
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,260
You can trust me. 

595
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,320
How do I know ? 

596
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,540
Because if you do this,then tell 
your parents, I lose my license. 

597
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,800
Ow ! God ! 

598
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,820
Get in here ! 

599
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,620
Wow. Spleen basically exploded, huh ? 

600
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,360
Got another bleeder. 

601
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,560
2-0 silk on a stick. 

602
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,590
Got it. 

603
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,760
I believe you ordered your meat rare. 

604
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,150
Keep him open... if I confirm wegener's,

605
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,800
might as well stage the 
diseasewhile he's still on the table. 

606
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,650
What's taking so long ? 

607
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,900
External capsule's ruptured but still intact. 

608
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,110
No signs of a clot or bleed. 

609
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:52,840
Normal follicles. 

610
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,570
Normal lymphoid tissue. 

611
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,740
His spleenis ripped to shreds. 

612
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,910
There's gotta be granulomas. Keep looking. 

613
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,350
Come on. 

614
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,560
Can't leave humpty dumpty like this forever. 

615
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,090
I don't see anythingbut normal spleen. 

616
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,080
No granulomas. 

617
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,050
Means no wegener's. 

618
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,300
That's all I need to know. 

619
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,930
Let's go, people. 

620
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,120
Run his bowel. 

621
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,090
No need. 

622
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,250
I'm closing. 

623
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,570
Suture. 

624
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,540
Run his bowel. 

625
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,610
Nothing suspiciousin the spleen. 

626
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,100
Get him out of here. 

627
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,570
You missed it. 

628
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,480
He had a granulomain his liver. 

629
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,640
No, it was just scar tissue. 

630
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,990
Looked like a granuloma 
on the mri, but it's not. 

631
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,720
Don't know whyI'm debating this. 

632
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,730
Pass me the kelly clamp. 

633
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,650
I'm closing. 

634
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,140
Not unless you're gonna sew my 
hand into this kid's stomach. 

635
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,440
Get out of there. 

636
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,830
He's unstable. 

637
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,160
He's got wegener's,
which means he's got granulomas. 

638
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,550
I'm calling my lawyer. 

639
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,790
It's only 26 feet. 

640
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,930
If he were an ostrich,
you'd have a 46-foot wait. 

641
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,760
Blood pressure's dropping. 

642
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,580
Hang another bag of ringer's lactate. 

643
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,970
I'm having nothing to do with this. 

644
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,230
- Foreman,hang another bag...
- Ringer's lactate. Got it. 

645
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,600
Come on, come on. 

646
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,660
It's gotta be in here. 

647
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,770
It's gotta be in here. 

648
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,910
But it's not. 

649
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,690
Mind if we close ? 

650
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,820
Well, it's a good thing 
we never sold him on ft-28. 

651
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,970
His parents were right. 

652
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,490
There's no way his parents 
are gonna let us near him again. 

653
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,170
they won't be able to transfer him 
until he's recovered from the surgery. 

654
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,520
You can add the surgical team to the list 
of people who won't let us near him. 

655
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,450
Bleeds, clots, bleeds, clots. 

656
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,030
Spleen explodes. 

657
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,230
We should test himfor von willebrand's. 

658
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,640
Or we could just play tic-tac-toe. 

659
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,470
Okay, xs are bleeds. 

660
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,180
Os are clots. 

661
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,760
We started in the lungs, right ? 

662
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,580
What did we do ? 

663
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,640
Ct, sputum, two venograms. 

664
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,230
That's one bleed, one clot. 

665
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,000
Then what ? 

666
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,570
Liver shut down. 

667
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,570
Mri, labs, treated with cyclophosphamide. 

668
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,200
Whereupon, he peed out 
3 units of o negative. 

669
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:56,950
Another bleed. 

670
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,110
Where is this going ? 

671
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,120
I don't know yet. 

672
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,840
What's next ? 

673
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,660
Bladder, kidneys. 

674
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,200
high resolution ct scan. 

675
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,490
Ua and urine sediment. 

676
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,360
Gi tract ? 

677
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,990
You ran his small bowel in the or. 

678
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,240
The large bowelis fixed 
to the abdominal wall. 

679
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:08,970
I didn't run that. 

680
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,120
Because there was no reason to. 

681
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,090
He hasn't been having 
any symptoms in his bowels. 

682
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,570
Do a colonoscopy. 

683
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,210
Because he's had no symptoms ? 

684
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,370
You lose your keys,first 
thing you do is look everywhere

685
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,810
you might logically have placed them. 

686
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,010
You don't find them, then 
you start looking in other places. 

687
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,910
The medicine cabinet, freezer, mailbox. 

688
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,730
We need to lookin this kid's mailbox. 

689
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,130
Why don't we x-ray his feet ? 

690
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
They're fine too. 

691
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,390
Because we need to take 
the center square to block. 

692
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,740
Okay, even if that did 
make sense, it's kind of hard to

693
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,520
do a colonoscopy on 
a kid you can't get near. 

694
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,540
He's in the icu now. 

695
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,860
His parents only have 
limited visiting privileges. 

696
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,110
I like that kid. 

697
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,030
He's got spunk. 

698
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,090
Can't talk now. 

699
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,320
On guard duty. 

700
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,620
You're still in that thing. 

701
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,390
What thing ? 

702
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,780
Oh, this. 

703
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,940
Forgot it was even there. 

704
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,000
You know,even if you manage 
not to get struck down by

705
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,090
a bolt of lightning and make it a week, 
cuy's not gonna give you the space. 

706
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,140
She can't. 

707
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,130
Bet's a bet. 

708
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,620
Yes, and that rule out ranks 
the americans with disabilities act. 

709
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,010
You think you've got logic on your side, 
but whitner's got the legal system. 

710
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,720
And legal bets logic every time... 
just ask O. J. 

711
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,730
You're right. 

712
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,220
I am ? Yeah. 

713
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,010
So you're doing this even though you know 
you've got no legal leg to stand on. 

714
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,500
Who needs legs when you got wheels ? 

715
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,700
I'm gonna get that spot. 

716
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,390
No way cuddyis going to gyp me ! 

717
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,500
What'd you say ? 

718
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,550
I'll see you later. 

719
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,330
Gonna have them yelling 
at me for the next 20 minutes. 

720
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,400
Mucosa looks normal, healthy. 

721
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,510
No lonely diverticula. 

722
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,040
Blood pressure's dropping. 

723
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,200
He's bleeding agn. 

724
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,260
not in his colon. 

725
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,390
- Hurry up. 
- I am. 

726
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,410
There's nothing there. 

727
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,660
Wait, wait, what's that ? 

728
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,450
A reflection ? 

729
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:24,870
No, it's something... 
looks like A... toothpick. 

730
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,170
Are you sure ? 

731
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,800
He must have swallowed it accidentally and

732
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:31,150
just figured he'd digest it eventually. 

733
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,210
When you two were making out in the car,

734
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,600
it must have folded awkwardly 
and pushed the toothpick

735
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,000
through the wall of the 
intestine and into the lung. 

736
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,780
And it moved on to his liver and 
made its wayto his bladder and spleen. 

737
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,310
So that's it. He's gonna be okay. 

738
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,130
Yeah. Small holes. 

739
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,390
He shouldn't take that long to heal, 
now that we've got it out. 

740
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,160
See ? 

741
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,370
See what you did ? 

742
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,230
Me ? 

743
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,290
If you hadn't been kissing him... 

744
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:55,170
that's what you heard ? It was the toothpick ! 

745
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,440
It was that disgusting habit...

746
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,410
it would have just passed right through 
him if he hadn't been writhing around. 

747
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,720
Isn't that right...

748
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,020
- That's it ? 
- Yeah. 

749
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,030
That's it. 

750
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,430
Wood absorbs water, becomes the same 
density as the tissue around it. 

751
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,660
That's why it didn't show 
upon the ct or mri. 

752
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,530
That's cool. 

753
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:26,520
I mean, not cool for me, but... 
lotta damagefor something so small. 

754
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,500
You know, the lab here, 
they have a paid intern position. 

755
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,750
It's usually given to one ofthe 
kids from the universities,

756
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:38,780
but if you want, I could 
probably get you an interview. 

757
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,160
There's some entry-level 
stuff,some gopher work,

758
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,720
but you'd also have access 
to a lot of cool things. 

759
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:52,270
Thanks, really, but... I can't. 

760
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,340
Yes, you can. 

761
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,160
Stevie, you're bright. 

762
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:00,560
You have more curiosity than 
90% of the doctors on the staff. 

763
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,260
Uh... it's not that. 

764
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,320
It's just... 

765
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,570
I go to work every day 
with my family, you know ? 

766
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,300
People I've known my whole life. 

767
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,460
I don't want to lose that. 

768
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,470
You can have both. 

769
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,540
No, I can't. 

770
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,460
Because they don't want to let you. 

771
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,330
They shouldn't be making you choose. 

772
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,550
Maybe not, but they are. 

773
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,900
And I'm choosing them. 

774
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,540
Look, change is hard. 

775
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,080
Trust me, I know. 

776
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,050
But it worked out for me. 

777
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,020
You're a successful doctor. 

778
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,800
Your name is on journal articles. 

779
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,210
I would love that. 

780
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,420
It's just... 

781
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,000
I see you with Drs. 
Chaseand cameron, and... 

782
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:03,020
you all got empty ring fingers. 

783
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,330
You're alone. 

784
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,360
Oh ho ho. 

785
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,670
This is my last day 
living a life of leisure. 

786
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,070
So are you gonna tell dr. Whitner 
she's outta my space or can I ? 

787
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,370
Why would I do that ? 

788
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,950
Because you said that you would. 

789
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,330
And lying is wrong. 

790
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,440
I said I would give you the space 
if you made ita whole week...

791
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,780
- Which I...
- Didn't. 

792
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,890
The bet didn't stipulate that 
you had to be in the chair

793
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,220
for a week unless you had to 
barge into an operating room

794
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,340
and shove your hands in a kid's bowels. 

795
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,210
You know about that. 

796
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,180
You lost. 

797
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,290
I saved a life. 

798
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,210
Two minutes out of the 
chair to save a kid's life. 

799
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,410
You lost, house. 

800
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,260
I earned that space. 

801
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,940
No, you didn't. 

802
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,770
I earn that space every day I limp into 
that building and do my damn job. 

803
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,640
You lo-o-ost. 

804
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,080
Hey ! 

805
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,640
You were never gonna give me 
that space, were you ? 

806
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,940
I saw whitner the other day. 

807
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,840
She knew about the bet. 

808
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,280
Didn't seem that worried. 

809
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,820
She knew I'd win. 

810
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,700
But she doesn't know me. 

811
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,610
In fact, she doesn't know 
anything except what you tell her,

812
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:36,540
and you told her that you were never 
gonna give me that space, didn't you ? 

813
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,080
Just tell me. 

814
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,820
Do you at least feel a little guilty ? 

815
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:49,560
If you wanna teach me lessons, don't make 
commitments you can't keep. 

816
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,830
How's it going ? 

817
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,230
How guilty does she look ? 

818
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,820
About an eight. 

819
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,700
That space is mine. 

820
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,330
Veni, vidi, vici.
