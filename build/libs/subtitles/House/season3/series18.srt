1
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,280
Fran?

2
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,380
I'm robi

3
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,570
Please,come in.

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,050
cute home.

5
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,600
Two bedroom,one bath?

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,510
Yeah.

7
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,110
A guy I know collects those.

8
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,250
He says they're worth
a fortune on the internet.

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,580
Yeah.

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,770
You've never used our agency before,
have you?

11
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,450
Is it that obvious?

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,800
As you can see,
we offer a full range of services.

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,420
"Round the world"?

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,480
Our deluxe package offers
all the services of a,b,and C.

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,900
How much?

16
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,130
$1,000.

17
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,460
And satisfaction's guaranteed.

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,720
Twice.

19
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,950
I'll get the money.

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,700
I'll get ready.

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,450
Harrington?

22
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,240
Harrington.

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,110
What are you doing up there?

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,670
All right,now.

25
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,120
Don't take this personally,
but you're gonna have to go??

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,000
Fran?

27
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,270
Is this okay?

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,400
Fran?

29
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,430
Fran?

30
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,240
Are you all right?

31
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,740
Oh,god.

32
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,110
Fran?

33
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,110
Yeah,I--
I need an ambulance at 500 north sycamore.

34
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,850
I don't know.

35
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,450
My...friend collapsed.

39
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,820
and what were you doing when you fainted?

40
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,760
We were just--

41
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,280
looking for her cat.

42
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,750
And have you banged your head recently?

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,630
No.

44
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,620
Is this a motion sickness patch?

45
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,310
I must've forgotten to take it off.

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
I just got back from a trip.

47
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,170
Oops.

48
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,110
Scopolamine can cause
dizziness and blurred vision.

49
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,530
You probably hit your head
when you fell

50
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,910
and that caused the blackout.

51
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,090
I thought those patches were supposed
to prevent you from getting sick.

52
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,690
Every drug has a side effect.

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,990
But it might be a good idea
to keep your eye on her

54
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,190
for the next few hours
to make sure she's okay.

55
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,010
Oh,actually I--

56
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,770
she has to get back to work.

57
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,530
Is it important?

58
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,290
We just don't like people to be alone
after they leave here.

59
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,040
I'm fine.

60
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,720
Really,I'm-- I'm--

61
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,820
Fran?

62
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,250
Fr-Fran?

63
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,450
I got a seizure. Code cart!

64
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,450
What's wrong with her?

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,000
I have no idea.

66
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,630
Where's house?

67
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,470
Antique vintner's cane.

68
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,970
It cost me $900.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
It had a corkscrew in it.

70
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,600
Ah,that would explain
the "vintner's" reference.

71
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,910
Could be used as a weapon
against the pilot.

72
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,910
Only if you stuck it
in a bottle of zinfandel.

73
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,990
You'll get it back when we land.

74
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,290
I want my blankie!
I want my blankie!

75
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,900
Give her 20 milligrams of antihistamine.

76
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,940
It could save her life.

77
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,620
Cause if she doesn't shut up,
I'll kill her.

78
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,070
delivering good
will to yet another continent.

79
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,420
You only forced me to deliver a speech,
not good will.

80
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,580
You gave a three-minute speech.

81
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,000
You know how much
WHO accreditation means to the hospital?

82
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,750
May have been short,
but it had girth.

83
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,800
And the room service thing
was just spiteful.

84
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,460
I was hungry.

85
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,890
- $300 for a bottle of wine.
- Was thirstY.

86
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,020
$120 on video services.

87
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,040
I was lonely.

88
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,080
That's $500 in expenses
I can't justify.

89
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,110
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,800
Right.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,280
Here you are,sir.

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,320
Welcome aboard.

93
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,670
Mr. House,you're right here in 2a.

94
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,860
Ms. Cuddy,you're in the next cabin
and to the left,9c.

95
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,230
No,I booked two first-class tickets.

96
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,390
This must be a mistake.

97
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,270
No mistake.

98
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,180
Just arranged for a $500 fare reduction.

99
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,140
Expense problem solved.

100
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,160
Where did you travel?

101
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,110
Duluth.

102
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,770
To visity sister.

103
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,950
Really?

104
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,310
Is this her artwork?

105
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,250
fire...butt?

106
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,490
I was a little drunk.

107
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,910
Where were you a little drunk?

108
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,550
I turned 58 last march.

109
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,890
Same age my mother was
when she died.

110
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,990
Next week I packed a bag.

111
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,000
I went to jfk.

112
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,350
Looked at the big board.

113
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,330
Took the first plane
that went to a warm place.

114
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,800
Caracas.

115
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,590
Oh,my god.

116
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,880
Did you drink the water?

117
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,120
Eat salads? Any raw foods?

118
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,450
Yup.

119
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,830
And?

120
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,130
I also did mescal shooters,

121
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,750
and snorted cocaine from
a homosexual man's stomach.

122
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,350
Did you have sex?

123
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,550
No.

124
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,040
Not with him.

125
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,330
I had sex with el gordo.

126
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,700
He was a large man.

127
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,530
Oh,my god.

128
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,750
I never do things like that.

129
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,600
I should have gone to visit my sister.

130
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,910
It was stupid.

131
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,580
That's why I'm sick,isn't it?

132
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,420
Uh...

133
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,770
it's...possible.

134
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,670
Here you are.
Rib eye,medium rare.

135
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,730
Thank you.

136
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,110
Some more pinot grigio?

137
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,000
Uh,no.

138
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,540
I think I will switch to the syrah.

139
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,830
Sir,are you all right?

140
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,190
He's drunk.

141
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,010
See?

142
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,310
[korean]***

143
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,690
[korean]***

144
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,650
Does anyone speak korean?

145
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,670
Is anyone a doctor?

146
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,580
Yes.

147
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,750
I'll go get her.

148
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,380
What do you want?

149
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,090
Did you really think I was gonna leave you
stuck back here for 18 hours?

150
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,140
Go on. Enjoy.

151
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,940
The vicodin and the wine.

152
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,600
I could sleep anywhere.

153
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,920
Thank you.

154
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,740
we should put her back
on the scopolamine patch.

155
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,340
She can't wear motion sickness patches
for the rest of her life.

156
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,610
no,but if it does relieve her symptoms,
it'll narrow down our search.

157
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,830
Ugh,anything else
you two guys want to agree on?

158
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,130
You have a problem with us agreeing?

159
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,320
no,I have a problem with
the other thing you're doing

160
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,210
which makes me question
your motive for agreeing.

161
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,310
I'll put her backon the patch.

162
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,930
What else?

163
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,640
It's got to be something neurological.

164
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,740
We should do a ct and
look for a brain tumor.

165
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,390
It can also be an allergy or
something environmental.

166
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,610
We should check her home.

167
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,150
Bit more likely she got sick in caracas
than in new jersey.

168
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,630
Right,
I forgot there are no toxins in the U.S.

169
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,770
I think I'm starting to feel sorry for house.

170
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,320
Get a tox screen,chem 20,std panel,
blood cultures,

171
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,960
then you run a ct,
and you check her house.

172
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,360
Please.

173
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,470
Not funny.

174
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,390
Wasn't supposed to be funny "ha ha."

175
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,060
Fever,headache,severe abdominal pain,
and a rash

176
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,720
all over his lower back.

177
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,660
It's serious.

178
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,970
It may be contagious.

179
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,500
We just attended a symposium
on pandemics

180
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,360
and you run right into one
on the flight home.

181
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,370
Talk about a small world.

182
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,630
If it's meningococcus,
half the passengers on this plane

183
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,600
could get infected
and die before we reach new york.

184
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,590
Is someone sick?

185
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,790
No.

186
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,330
Someone has a hangover.

187
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,940
He had a snoot-load of bloody
marys before dinner.

188
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,410
Watch the movie.

189
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,120
That booze did not give him the rash.

190
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,010
It is textbook meningococcus.

191
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,550
It's also textbook allergic reaction
to pollen,peanuts,

192
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,370
semen-stained polyester blanket
he's lying on.

193
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,010
Mr. Peng's throwing up again.

194
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,440
We have to turn around.

195
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,090
What?

196
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,750
- Why do we have to turn ar--?
- We don'T.

197
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,000
You misunderstood.

198
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,630
Dr. Cuddy just meant that
he might feel less nauseous

199
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,460
if he was facing in
a different direction.

200
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,590
She didn't mean to
panica plane load of people.

201
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,570
We're about to head over the north pole.

202
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,530
We don't turn back now,
the next er's 15 hours away.

203
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,550
He'll be fine.

204
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,790
I'm a doctor too.

205
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,910
You haven't examined him.

206
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,050
Korean male, mid-thirties, 5'9, 160, bald,

207
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,600
scar on the rightside of his jaw,

208
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,240
medic alert bracelet on his left wrist

209
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,860
indicating that he is allergic to at least,
penicillin.

210
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,110
Without any way to do an lp,
or rule out meningococcus,

211
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,370
our only choice is to assume the worst.

212
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,210
Good point.

213
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,160
On the other hand,

214
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,680
I ama board certified specialist
in infectious disease.

215
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,940
She assigns parking spaces.

216
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,270
Please let me know if he gets any worse.

217
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,590
Think we should feed the cat?

218
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,200
Bowl's full.

219
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,400
If he wants it,he can get it.

220
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,410
Cadmium yellow?

221
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,250
Heavy metal poisoning would explain
the ataxia and the seizures.

222
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,230
Not unless she was painting with her tongue.

223
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,110
Is Foreman right?

224
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Did you agree with me
because of our relationship?

225
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,760
Relationship?

226
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,700
You know what I mean.

227
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,760
You mean because of
our lack of a relationship?

228
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,210
I mean because we're having sex.

229
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,040
Yes,Foreman's right.

230
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,410
I thought you were completely wrong
about the medicine,

231
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,480
but agreed with you anyway,

232
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,660
because I figured then you'd do
mein some old lady's home.

233
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,210
Then well played.

234
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,970
Come on,we're supposed
to be looking for toxins.

235
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,040
We agreed it was a brain tumor.

236
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,330
What?

237
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,670
He's watching.

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,030
Haven't you had any body watch before?

239
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,220
Is that guy really sick?

240
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,570
No,he's all better.

241
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,860
I don't believe you.

242
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,390
Look that way.

243
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,990
Why?

244
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,530
Cae you're gonna throw up
and I don't want it on me.

245
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,390
I'll get some towels.

246
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,390
Give her a banana.

247
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,920
Monkey see, monkey barf.

248
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,120
You smell vomit--

249
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,700
okay.

250
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,570
I wasn't expecting that.

251
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,710
I need help.

252
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,460
Who doesn't?

253
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,090
I need someone to talk to.

254
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,070
Can you say...

255
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,090
"crikey, mate"?

256
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,420
Crikey, mate.

257
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,600
Perfect.

258
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,270
No matter what I say,
you agree with me,okay?

259
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,880
O-kay.

260
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,370
Nicely done.

261
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,020
You disagree with everything I say.

262
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,900
Sorry.

263
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,500
Not understanding.

264
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,960
That's close enough.

265
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,780
And you...

266
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,080
get morally outraged at everything I say.

267
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,040
That's permanent marker,you know?

268
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,470
You guys are good.

269
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,910
We are looking for the simplest way
to explain these symptoms.

270
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,860
Organophosphate poisoning.

271
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,790
Some international flights spray pesticides.

272
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,430
Uh, could be.

273
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,470
Sorry, english not so nice.

274
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,820
Is this a joke?

275
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,440
Just passed the halfway mark.

276
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,780
Can't turn around.

277
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,240
- Nice call. - No worries.

278
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,320
We think it's pesticide poisoning.

279
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,510
We don't spray these flights.

280
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,730
Dramamine overdose.

281
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,890
wouldn't explain the fever.

282
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,610
jet lag.

283
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,190
Wouldn't explain the abdominal pain.

284
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,350
Deep vein thrombosis.

285
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,510
wouldn't explain the nausea.

286
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,400
Food poisoning.

287
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,220
What was on the menu?

288
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,630
Steak and sea bass in first class.

289
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,530
Fettuccini and seafood kebabs in economy.

290
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,880
Since when does food poisoning cause a rash?

291
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,650
Sea bass,seafood kebabs?

292
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,830
He had the sea bass.

293
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,050
Please tell me she had the kebabs.

294
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,400
I think so.

295
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,840
Ciguatera poisoning.

296
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,050
It's an instant onset toxin.

297
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,760
Symptoms include'e' all of the above.

298
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,540
It's only found in certain kinds of
tropical gamefish such as...

299
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,930
sea bass?

300
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,820
Make sure you get a resume from him.

301
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,760
Hello.

302
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,790
Excuse me.

303
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,700
ladies and gentlemen,

304
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,820
I have a brief announcement
concerning your meals.

305
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,460
If you ate the sea bass
or the seafood kebabs,

306
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,320
you have ingested a dangerous toxin.

307
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,560
However,if you proceed to the restrooms,

308
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,260
both on your left and right and in the rear of
the plane and vomit as soon as possible,

309
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,510
the toxic effect should be minimal.

310
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,090
Thank you and havea pleasant flight.

311
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,890
Meningococcus makes just as much sense.

312
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,060
I know.

313
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,080
What'd you find?

314
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,930
Nothing in her house.

315
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,080
Big waste of time.

316
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,910
Medically.

317
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,050
Ct was a complete waste.

318
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,160
She was negative for tumors,

319
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,420
her blood was negative for drugs,
heavy metals,

320
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,200
tropical diseases,food poisoning,and stds.

321
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,470
Also no signof lead poisoning or sepsis.

322
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,040
Apparently, venezuelan tattoo parlors
have standards after all.

323
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,200
Good to know.

324
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,590
We sure she's even sick?

325
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,450
Two more seizures in the last two hours.

326
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,160
Which is slower than she was having them
before you put the patch back on.

327
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,860
I'm an idiot.

328
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,290
She's exposed herself to so much crap,

329
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,540
I just assumed it was a zebra.

330
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,740
It's breast cancer.

331
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,640
since when is breast cancer treatable
by motion sickness meds?

332
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,470
It's not.

333
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,850
But the inflammation caused
by the paraneoplastic syndrome

334
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,700
caused by the cancer can be reduced
by anticholinergics.

335
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,190
Hey,here you go.

336
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,630
Is he gonna die?

337
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,250
We're doing all we can.

338
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,550
We don't know what's wrong with him yet.

339
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,930
Am I gonna die?

340
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,270
No.

341
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,690
Here,chew on these.

342
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,930
Good news is
all the pilots are red meat men.

343
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,160
Although I was kind of looking forward
to landing this puppy myself.

344
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,150
Peng's getting worse.

345
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,290
That makes sense.

346
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,350
First class ate before coach.

347
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,560
He digested more
of his food before he threw up.

348
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,180
Or you're wrong and we're gonna start
seeing neurological symptoms soon.

349
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,820
Seizures, paralysis, ataxia.

350
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,620
We're not gonna see ataxia.

351
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,040
You're so sure you're right.

352
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,610
No,it's just hard to show clumsiness
when you're lying moaning in the fetal position.

353
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,130
Hey!

354
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,740
Sss-- stand up!

355
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,050
Nobody speak korean on this flight?

356
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
I assumed you did.

357
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,070
I know how to ask him
if his sister's over 18.

358
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,170
I don't think that's gonna help.

359
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:05,980
Hey!

360
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,290
Stand up!

361
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,130
Stand up.

362
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,760
Don't play the cripple card with me.

363
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,940
*******

364
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,880
Oh,hi.

365
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,020
I'm leaving.

366
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,160
Work.

367
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,320
Oh,okay.

368
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,840
Important client.

369
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,110
Sure.

370
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,040
Um,listen...

371
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,310
are you close?

372
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,970
Why?

373
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,710
She needs a mammogram.

374
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,290
Oh,god.

375
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,950
I know I'm throwing a lot at you.

376
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,920
She just has no family in town.

377
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,750
And I really think
she could use a friend right now.

378
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,850
Okay,put your hand here.

379
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,510
You don't have to stay.

380
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,110
No,it'S...

381
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,300
no problem.

382
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,930
But why?

383
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,870
You don't even know me.

384
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,780
You gotta be scared.

385
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,000
I almost hope it's breast cancer.

386
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,830
No.

387
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,340
Then it wouldn't be my fault.

388
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,840
Whatever it is, it's not your fault.

389
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,430
That's not true.

390
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,760
You can control things.

391
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,350
Not everything.

392
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,470
But you don't have to take stupid risks.

393
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,650
I was being an idiot.

394
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,870
You were having fun.

395
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,280
You have regrets?

396
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,510
Yeah.

397
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,210
robin.

398
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,880
Hold still.

399
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,810
Good.

400
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,580
Okay, we're gonna get just one more.

401
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,550
Sorry, I know it hurts.

402
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,840
It's not that.

403
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,050
It's my eye.

404
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,680
My right eye, I--

405
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,120
I can't see.

406
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,560
it's definitely ataxia.

407
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,200
It's definitely a rash.

408
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,660
You want to look at itfor five more minutes
before concluding it's also definitely a leg.

409
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,550
Thin leg.

410
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,720
It's been in a cast.

411
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,500
So?

412
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,980
So it could be radiation poisoning.

413
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,140
From a broken leg?

414
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,420
From the x-rays they took of it.

415
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,610
He could break every bone in his body

416
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,210
and still not have enough x-rays
to cause radiation sickness.

417
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,000
Unless those x-rays
were performed in "wankoff",

418
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,300
north korea by a third-grade
dropout with a 50-year-old imager.

419
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,190
Which accounts for the absence of fur.

420
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,590
Radiation poisoning accounts for
all the symptoms.

421
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,550
I have hair.

422
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,030
I haven't had an x-ray
since I got my teeth whitened.

423
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,320
You're pregnant.

424
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,040
I'm what?

425
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,230
Explains the nausea, abdominal pains, fever.

426
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,610
And why you're stuffing your 36cs into a 34b bra.

427
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,470
- and her rash?
- Pupps.

428
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,880
A common pregnancy rash.

429
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,300
I can't be pregnant.

430
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,290
You a virgin?

431
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,140
- No,but--
- you're pregnant.

432
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,230
Mazel tov.

433
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,610
Let's get him into the chair.

434
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,540
Two different diagnose

435
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,360
I thought  you didn't believe
in coincidences.

436
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,950
I believe in statistics.

437
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,400
200 passengers on the plane.

438
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,310
10 should be gay,

439
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,400
two should be with child,

440
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,570
and one should be incredibly annoying
with an extra ass chromosome.

441
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,330
House.

442
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,640
Get him some iodized salt to protect his thyroid.

443
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,600
- I'm going back--
- house.

444
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,520
You're wrong.

445
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,820
I said we should've turned back.

446
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,530
You should have listened to me.

447
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,160
Now we're eight miles over the arctic??

448
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,640
I'm trying to listen to you now,
so shut up.

449
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,340
Heart's fine.

450
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,630
Breasts are firm.

451
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,730
is it contagious?

452
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,500
A lot of the passengers are scared.

453
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,860
Tell them there's nothing to worry about.

454
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,890
Is there something to worry about?

455
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,110
Yeah.

456
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,180
Tell them there's nothingto worry about.

457
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,810
Get me a flash light.

458
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,740
Cover your left eye with this.

459
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,090
Mm-- photophobia!

460
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,910
Symptom of meningitis.

461
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,450
We need antibiotics.

462
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,420
I'll call down to the pharmacy.

463
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,700
You're creeping me out.

464
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,410
Then get me a lab.

465
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,800
Pseudomonas smell yeasty.

466
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,310
Staph smells musty.

467
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,560
Some liver diseases smellof ammonia.

468
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,130
House,I'm not in heat.

469
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,450
Citrusy on the nose,
with a blush of toasted coconut.

470
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,170
I need to get a better look at your rash.

471
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,490
Use your imagination.

472
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,590
Fine,shall I gowith lifeguard cuddy
or mother superior cuddy?

473
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,220
Three more passengers are sick.

474
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,350
If we don't get drugs,

475
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,870
we're gonna have a lot of dead passengers.

476
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,330
Blindness in her right eye
indicates it's not breast cancer.

477
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,680
It's likely neurological.

478
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,700
I just met her today.

479
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,600
You should go.

480
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,140
She needs someone here.

481
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,590
That's not your job.

482
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,950
Please let me know that she's okay.

483
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,180
It's just sex.

484
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,600
There's no such thing.

485
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,410
Other eye.

486
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,820
are you saying women can't separate
the physicalfrom the emotional?

487
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,900
No one does it well.

488
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,170
Women do it worse.

489
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,340
You just want us to stop,
because you thinkit's affecting--

490
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,310
me.

491
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,320
Yeah.

492
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,700
Polyspikes over 01 and 02.

493
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,980
That's her left eye.

494
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,590
Burst suppression on every lead.

495
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,970
Fran?

496
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,200
She's comatose.

497
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,380
nothing...

498
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,090
Nothing...

499
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,030
Come on,nody has no meds.

500
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,350
Excuse me.

501
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,440
Open your mouth.

502
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,980
Where is the acyclovir?

503
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,310
I'm not on any meds.

504
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,730
Well,you'd better get some.

505
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,020
You've got herpes.

506
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,390
Oh,what do you know?

507
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,600
He's got some.

508
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,160
This must be your lucky day.

509
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,510
This is for real!

510
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,920
People are sick.

511
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,040
Some of us will be deplaning in body
bags unless you cough up.

512
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,530
Thank you...

513
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,150
thank you.

514
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,450
Thank you.

515
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,710
God bless you.

516
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,000
her brain is shutting down
because of intercranial pressure.

517
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,230
Or her nerves are dying.

518
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,920
Because of the increased pressure.

519
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,000
She has a bleed in her brain.

520
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,920
- You said the ct showed--
- no tumors.

521
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,060
But if she has an avm
leading to a cerebral hemorrhage,

522
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,220
we could have missed it.

523
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,440
She needs a burr holeto relieve??

524
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,480
you want to drill in her brain because of
an invisible bleed the ct couldn't see?

525
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,330
We should do an lp to confirm
the presence of red blood cells.

526
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,900
And her brain herniates and
then she dies.

527
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,820
Right, better to kill herin the or.

528
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,230
Chase,what do you think?

529
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,570
Here's a cliffhanger.

530
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,490
I think it'd help to know what she has
before we start digging into her brain.

531
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,340
Might be betterto play it safe to start.

532
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,740
Do an lp.

533
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,450
Sex better be damn good.

534
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,340
Lotta apples, not many candy bars.

535
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,890
Any antibiotics?

536
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,030
Three caps of augmentin.

537
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,860
There are six patients.

538
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,990
Give them to peng.

539
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,590
He's allergic to penicillin.

540
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,680
The first aid kit has two epi pens.

541
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,010
if he has a severe reaction,

542
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,260
ten epi pens won't save him,
you take the pills.

543
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,330
He's worse.

544
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,120
He's a guy who doesn't speak english.

545
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,550
Give him the meds.

546
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,660
If it's not meningitis,

547
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,210
we're risking his life
and flushing meds down the toilet.

548
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,200
Then do an lp on him.

549
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,740
If it's clear,you win.

550
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,860
If it's cloudy,

551
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,990
he gets the augmentin and

552
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,940
we risk a reaction.

553
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,830
Sounds like a plan.

554
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,190
Oh,except for the part
where we don't have an lp needle.

555
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,510
Oh,and the shaking of the plane means

556
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,620
I'll probably pierce his spinal cord
and cripple him for life,

557
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,560
but,i mean,
it totally sounds like a plan.

558
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,990
You're right.

559
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,290
Let him die.Give me the meds.

560
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,690
Got it.

561
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,190
Damn.

562
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,990
- What is it?
- Shut up.

563
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,190
Don't get hysterical.

564
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,390
Just tell me what the hell it is.

565
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,890
House!

566
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,890
We should have turned back.

567
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,190
We should have turned back!

568
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,390
House!

569
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,790
Hold this.

570
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,190
Ladies and gentlemen,

571
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,990
we have a passenger with a confirmed
case of bacterial meningitis.

572
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,890
And even if we land as soon as possible,

573
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,290
the passenger will not survive.

574
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,590
It's very likely that some of you
have been infected as well.

575
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,790
As soon as you start feeling symptoms,

576
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,290
we need to isolate you
in the first class cabin.

577
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,390
Fever, rash, nausea,

578
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,590
and in the late stages...

579
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,390
tremor in the left hand.

580
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,690
I have that.

581
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,790
Oh, god.

582
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,590
No!

583
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,390
What do we do?

584
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,590
Break out the bubbly.

585
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,890
Yo! Listen up!

586
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,590
Bad news is you have an illness.

587
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,290
The good news is,it's not meningitis.

588
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,290
It's not fatal.

589
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,790
It's just embarrassing.

590
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,190
It's conversion disorder.

591
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,990
Or commonly known as mass hysteria.

592
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,390
It happens often in high anxiety
situations,especially to women.

593
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,290
I know it sounds sexist,

594
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,890
but science says you're weak and soft,
what can I do?

595
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,590
house, you're wrong.

596
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,490
Look at my hand.

597
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,290
Yeah,look at her hand.Shaking left hand.

598
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,890
What is that a symptom of?
Not meningitis.

599
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,790
It's basically a symptom of nothing.

600
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,890
put the idea into their heads
and watched it happen.

601
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,090
Same thing that peng cruelly did
with the puking and the rash.

602
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,390
The rash is in my head?

603
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,790
Your mind controls your body.

604
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,290
It thinks you're sick,
it makes you sick.

605
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,990
If--if you'll all just calm down,

606
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,490
your symptoms will soon go away.

607
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,790
And to facilitate this process,

608
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,790
your flight crew will move through the cabin
with a complimentary bar service.

609
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,290
Thank you and, as always,
have a pleasant flight.

610
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,490
- Still feel like puking?
- No.

611
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,790
How did you know?

612
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,290
Lp was negative.

613
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,190
I came up with an alternate theory
and I tested it.

614
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,790
Couldn't have done it without you.

615
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,490
Rage is a symptom of mass hysteria.

616
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,490
Just one more thing to clean up.

617
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,990
Peng set off the mass hysteria.

618
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,090
What set off peng?

619
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,890
He really is dying.

620
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,090
Yeah. And I haven't the faintest idea why.

621
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,190
What's extension pastoring?

622
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,890
It's when you're molested
by a priest's cousin.

623
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,390
Do we really need these three?

624
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,390
Worried they'll make you look bad?

625
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,990
Could be symptomatic of head trauma.

626
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,490
Cerebral infarction or
intercranial hemorrhage.Thoughts?

627
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,990
How long till we land?

628
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,190
Too long to wait.

629
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,190
His head's as smooth as a baby's bottom.

630
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,090
No bumps,so I think we
can rule out head trauma.

631
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,790
So you gotta choose between what's left.

632
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,290
Clog or a leak?

633
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,190
you're talking of toilet?

634
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,290
House.

635
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,290
Is this actually helpful?

636
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,890
Not so far.

637
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,590
What about syphilis?

638
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,190
First of all,he apparently speaks
a language that no one else speaks.

639
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,490
Which makes talking up the
ladies a little rough.

640
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,890
We're flying out of singapore.

641
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,890
If he has a credit card and a condom,
he can get anything he wants.

642
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,290
What?

643
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,090
Condoms.

644
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,190
He has focal limb paralysis.

645
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,590
His legs got paralyzed by a condom?

646
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,890
No, by cocaine
that was inside the condom,

647
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,890
and is now spreading
through his digestive tract.

648
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,690
You think he's a mule.

649
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,690
I think he's a jackass.

650
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,590
We're gonna have to operate.

651
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,290
Cool.

652
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,090
They're gonna kill her.

653
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,790
We were wrong.

654
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,590
Which means Foreman was right.

655
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,490
Maybe Foreman's right about us too.

656
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,590
Maybe we should just stop all this.

657
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,090
I mean, if it's affecting our jobs.

658
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,990
It's not affecting our jobs.

659
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,990
We had sex in a patient's bedroom.

660
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,390
A bedroom we were examining for toxins.

661
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,390
Yeah, our judgment's right on the mark.

662
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,090
All right, no more sex at patient's homes.

663
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,390
No more sex with cats watching.

664
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,890
Anywhere else you want
to cross off the list?

665
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,390
- The bowl.
- What?

666
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,090
Has she eaten since she's been here?

667
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,190
She's been sick since she's been here.

668
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,990
What if it's a symptom?

669
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,590
- Why would you think--
- the bowl was full.

670
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,690
you're gonna need to hold him down.

671
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,890
He's not gonna like this.

672
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,290
Do you really think he's a mule?

673
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,890
It fits the symptoms.

674
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,390
You sure he's not contagious?

675
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,190
Pretty much.

676
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,890
Can't be"pretty much" sure.

677
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,190
It means you're not sure.

678
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,490
Oh, aren't you clever?

679
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,690
Well,I know you're
"pretty much" unconscious,

680
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,990
but as it's been pointed out to me,

681
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,690
"pretty much" doesn't mean squat.

682
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,990
Okay, hold him tight.

683
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,090
The faster we do this,
the less likely he is to die of shock.

684
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,990
Tighter.

685
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,890
- Sorry.
- Do that again.

686
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,390
Ease off, then press down.

687
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,290
Pressure on his joints
relieves his pain.

688
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,490
Okay.

689
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,290
Wrong again.

690
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,290
Where's his wallet?

691
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,690
DANGER:PREMISES HAVE BEEN FUMIGATED WITH
METHYL BROMIDE NO ADMITTANCE FOR 72 HOURS

692
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,090
Scuba certification card.

693
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,890
- Big deal.I have one of these.
- Yeah.

694
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,190
Do you alsohave a receipt from
tekong's scubarental dated yesterday?

695
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,590
Tell the captain to drop as
low as he can under 5,000 feet.

696
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,090
- We're at 38,000.We can't--
- peng's got the bends.

697
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,190
He went diving yesterday,

698
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,890
and like an idiot,
he surfaced too quickly.

699
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,190
And like a bigger idiot,

700
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,590
he boarded a flight which is pressurized
to 8,000 feet above sea level.

701
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,290
Low pressure is killing him.

702
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,490
Tell the pilot to dive until we can
club baby seals out of the window.

703
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,790
And get him some oxygen.

704
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,390
Fifty years ago,it was one estate.

705
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,890
The two homes shared an electrical system.

706
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,290
Unfortunately the exterminator
didn't know that,

707
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,990
so when they fumigated next door,

708
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,790
the poison gas flowed through
the old pipe and into your house.

709
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,990
the scopolamine patch was
masking the effects of the poison.

710
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,590
You'll have to stay here
for a few more days,

711
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,590
but after that you should be fine.

712
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,890
I'm sorry about your cat.

713
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,990
And your hair.

714
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,290
For 12 years,
harrington never left the property.

715
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,390
I thought I was being
punished for going away,but

716
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,690
really...

717
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,790
I was being punished for coming home.

718
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,990
Thank you.

719
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,990
I saved your life.You owe me.

720
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,990
I wasn't sick.

721
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,490
But you didn't know that.
You owe me.

722
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,190
I know it now.

723
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,790
Your mind convinced your body to
get a rash,photophobia,and vomit.

724
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,490
How do you know it wouldn't have
shut down your cold,cold heart next?

725
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,190
I don't owe you.

726
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,990
You're mean.

727
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,990
That's how I compensate for being weak...

728
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,090
and soft.

729
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,190
I just wanted to say thank you.

730
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,690
you're extremely welcome.

731
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,190
And I'm in new york every monday.

732
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,490
Are you handicap accessible?

733
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,690
*Stitch in your knitted brow*

734
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,190
*and you don't know how*

735
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,790
hi, robin?

736
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,290
This is, um, uh,
dr. Wilson, f-Fran's doctor.

737
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,390
James.

738
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,790
It was a toxin.

739
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,590
We caught it on time
and she's gonna be fine.

740
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,990
Yeah, it is.

741
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,290
listen, I was just wondering if
you were coming back in again to visit.

742
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,090
- Nice catch.
- Thanks.

743
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,990
Think even house would be impressed.

744
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,390
I don't know about that.

745
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,090
Any idea how you want to celebrate?

746
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,990
What?

747
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,390
I want more.

748
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,490
I thought you were getting a
little worn out, but--

749
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,490
that's not what I meant.

750
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,090
I know.

751
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,690
I was just hoping you'd take the hint
and pretend you never said that.

752
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,090
I want this to be more than it is.

753
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,990
I thought we were clear.

754
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,990
In the beginning,
but you can't tell me you--

755
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,490
yes, i can.

756
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,390
And I don'T.

757
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,790
It was.Fun.That's it.

758
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,290
And now it's over.
