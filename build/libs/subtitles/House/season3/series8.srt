9
00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:11,688
we'll dance, eat cake and do
the rump shake it's time for Ralphy

10
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:12,926
Are you okay, man?

11
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:22,128
You okay?

1
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:26,268
Now I'm gonna kill you!

2
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:26,268
Uh, I need a refill.

3
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:42,429
- You've already had three.
- So what? They're free.

12
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:32,858
It's time for Ralphy--

13
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:41,803
Okay, all right.
Let's get you in the back. Come on.

14
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:43,701
It's gonna be okay, kids. Sorry!

8
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:03,880
let's sing, let's ride let's bling,
let's slide it's time for Ralphy

6
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:42,429
All right...

4
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:42,429
I got a birthday. Get it yourself.

5
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:42,429
No wonder he doesn't get any tips.

7
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:42,429
who's ready to sing the Ralphy's
rump us birthday rump shake?

15
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:55,717
Got a heartbeat.

16
00:00:55,912 --> 00:00:57,388
Jack? Jack?

17
00:00:57,635 --> 00:00:59,737
- I need you to step back.
- He's my brother.

18
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:00,982
Jack! Wake up!

19
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:04,201
Call your parents, tell them
to go to Princeton Plainsboro hospital.

20
00:01:04,218 --> 00:01:05,410
Our parents died.

21
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,967
He's all we've got.

22
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:16,565
Transcript: ydy.com - Synchro: jh26

23
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:52,093
I was not parked illegally.
I-I live here.

24
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:55,189
Love note from detective Tritter.

25
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,538
Heart attack.

26
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:05,571
His cath was clean and echo
showed no structural abnormalities.

27
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:09,028
Fatigue, night sweats,
weight loss preceded the heart attack.

28
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:12,406
18-year-old kid, suddenly
an orphan and a single father of two.

29
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:14,601
Party of five! Powerful stuff.

30
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:16,696
The O.C. of its day.

31
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:21,482
Stress explains everything
except the itchy feet.

32
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:23,694
Athlete's foot covers that.

33
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:26,034
Waiters work 12 hours
a day in old sneakers.

34
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,621
Hmm, good idea.

35
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:30,221
Ignore the symptoms. Makes our job easy.

36
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:33,314
I'm not ignoring a symptom.
I'm explaining a symptom.

37
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:36,881
kid's been hanging over a toilet,
despite antiemetic therapy.

38
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:41,048
Persistent vomiting could indicate
increased intracranial pressure, tumor--

39
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:43,753
Sure. Heart problems.
It's gotta be the brain.

40
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:46,574
Thank god there's a
neurologist in the room.

41
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:50,142
Right. It's the feet.
If only I were a podiatrist.

42
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:53,653
Probably caught an intestinal
virus from one of those feral kids

43
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:57,201
running around. Repeated vomiting
causes an electrolyte imbalance,

44
00:02:57,201 --> 00:03:00,719
which leads to an arrhythmia,
which leads to the heart attack.

45
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:02,054
And itchy feet.

46
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:03,861
Nope.

47
00:03:04,681 --> 00:03:06,428
That's it? Nope?

48
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,983
- I've said too much already.
- This isn't a game, House.

49
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:11,804
No, it's not. But it could be.

50
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:16,938
- What are you writing?
- Nothing.

51
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:20,653
- If you know the diagnosis, why don't--
- How are you gonna learn to swim

52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,305
unless I take off your floaties and
throw you into shark-infested waters?

53
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,511
You can’t know what's wrong
after a 30-second perusal of his file.

54
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:29,894
Apparently you can’t.

55
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,079
Now, what's a game without rules?

56
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,708
No, tag-backs, no biting.
You get one test each.

57
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,884
And the clock runs until lunch.

58
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:46,136
If I'm right, he'll still be alive.
If I'm wrong, this is a very cruel game.

59
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:52,488
You're late. I charge for the
time you were supposed to be here.

60
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:56,813
Tritter towed my car. He's
frozen my assets. He's on a crusade.

61
00:03:57,215 --> 00:04:00,541
You're a person of interest
in a narcotics investigation.

62
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,864
You're linked to their
suspect and his activities.

63
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:07,412
I'm not Pablo Escobar’s evil henchman
cruising into Miami in a cigarette boat.

64
00:04:07,523 --> 00:04:10,191
I'm a physician who prescribed
vicodin to a pain patient.

65
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:14,448
This police report you faxed me says
they found 600 pills in his apartment.

66
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:17,266
- You prescribed those?
- He's in chronic pain.

67
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,373
- This is obviously an abuse of power.
- Is that a yes or no?

68
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:23,077
Patients build up a
tolerance over the years.

69
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,865
Perfect motive for
him to forge those scrips.

70
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:30,550
- I still don't have an answer.
- What, are we, like, role playing?

71
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:32,689
Yeah. And you suck at it.

72
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,784
Which is really unfortunate, because

73
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,592
you’re pretending to be you.

74
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,228
I gotta get to court.

75
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:40,906
Michael  told me you could
help me get my car back.

76
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:44,634
Yeah, divorce lawyers usually know
the ins and outs of drug enforcement.

77
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,075
You want your car back, you're gonna
have to give the cops what they want.

78
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:51,736
Thanks. Usually people feel
helpless in these situations.

79
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:54,869
Dr. House is probably going to jail.

80
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:58,929
You keep on lying for him,
you'll go right along with him.

81
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:04,592
House was on this page when he got
that annoying” I’m such a genius" look.

82
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:06,446
- What's there?
- Patient history.

83
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:09,368
He's 18. Probably drinks,
smokes, does drugs.

84
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:11,450
How close am I?

85
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,088
Quit drugs when his parents died.
Quit smoking.

86
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:21,648
House didn't mock my viral idea.
He just said it was wrong.

87
00:05:22,646 --> 00:05:25,523
Which means he didn't want
to give reasons. Which means,

88
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:26,910
I must have been close.

89
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,854
I'm thinking bacterial.

90
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,147
I'm doing a blood culture.

91
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:35,953
- I am doing an MRI.
- It there was a tumor,

92
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:39,260
intracranial pressure could cause
his brain to herniate before lunch.

93
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:42,690
- Same thing with your stress test.
- Which is why I’m ditching it.

94
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:45,337
- What are you doing instead?
- Not telling.

95
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,255
Seriously--you playing his game?

96
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:50,549
We're all playing his game.
Might as well enjoy it.

97
00:05:51,713 --> 00:05:53,263
Anybody else sick at work?

98
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:56,948
I had a stomach ache before him.

99
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,766
This isn't your fault, Will.
Keep working.

100
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:01,758
My brother's in the hospital.

101
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:04,853
Mrs. Collier won't care
if I finish my homework.

102
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:08,016
Your brother cares if
you finish your homework.

103
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,948
Can I be your imaginary friend?

104
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,609
He's a doctor.

105
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:29,886
How are the feet? Still itch?

106
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:33,744
Is that important?

107
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,270
I don't know.

108
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:36,766
Is it?

109
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,566
What kinds of drugs you into?

110
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:43,615
You don't have to talk
about that right now.

111
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:46,164
No,  it's okay.
I don't keep secrets from them.

112
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,829
They know I did drugs
before our parents died.

113
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:49,924
Clever.

114
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:52,594
Admit the past. Deny the present.

115
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:57,541
I'm clean. I'm raising two kids. It'd
be pretty irresponsible, wouldn't it?

116
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:00,399
But confiding in an
eight-year-old is okay?

117
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:03,405
If I'm open with them,
then they'll be open with me.

118
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:04,496
Yeah.

119
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:07,890
Turning the other cheek's
a good strategy in boxing.

120
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:10,029
Kids don't lie because
they got trust issues.

121
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:12,378
They lie because they
got something to hide.

122
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:13,473
Look at him,

123
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:16,509
sitting there doing nothing,
and he's still lying.

124
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:17,777
We don't lie to Jack.

125
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:21,435
- Spelling test you failed and forgot
- No.

126
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,526
- Math test?
- No.

127
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:24,290
Fight with the kid sitting next to you?

128
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:25,740
He doesn't sit next to me.

129
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:32,540
- The other one's probably having sex.
- I am not!

130
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:35,302
Yet. When you start,
you're gonna lie about it.

131
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,426
- Colder.
- I'm not playing.

132
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:54,763
Keep very still for me, Jack.
This won't take long.

133
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,001
How much dope did you smoke?

134
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:02,535
- Does he have to be here?
- No. Ignore him.

135
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:06,552
-  It's not his lungs.
- I never said it was.

136
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:08,175
What about the cigarettes?

137
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:11,050
How did you quit? Gum, patch, hypnosis?

138
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:15,254
He went from two packs to nothing,
cold turkey.

139
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:18,554
Or we could just make small talk.

140
00:08:19,113 --> 00:08:23,460
You still seeing that nurse in pedes?
I just don't think she's right for you.

141
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:24,611
You need someone...

142
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:27,118
detached, calculating, ambitious.

143
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:29,648
You need yourself in a skirt.

144
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:32,383
Jack, he asked you a question.

145
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,157
I didn't really quit.

146
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,189
I just sort of lost taste for it.

147
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:40,389
Interesting. Sounds like
one of those symptom thingies.

148
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:44,657
He's still puking, and he
had a heart attack and itchy feet.

149
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,479
- It's not his lungs.
- I never said it was.

150
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:55,179
Ice cold.

151
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:04,360
I'm injecting ergonovine
to see if your heart attack

152
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,871
was caused by a spasm in
the vessels surrounding your heart.

153
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:10,542
Let me know if anything feels...

154
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:12,604
unusual.

155
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:18,862
If the problem's around my heart, why
did that other doctor look at my brain?

156
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:21,797
Yeah, why did that other
doctor look at his brain?

157
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:26,600
We're just trying to eliminate
as many possibilities as we can.

158
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,632
So because you think the spasm

159
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:32,568
caused his heart attack,
you're gonna induce another spasm.

160
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,328
Did you consent to this?

161
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,842
Everything's under control.

162
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:41,096
Tests are gonna identify which arteries
are affected so we can repair them.

163
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:44,955
Your meds don't seem to be
doing anything. So either you're wrong,

164
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:49,410
or his system hasn’t been
pushed enough to set anything off.

165
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:01,054
You wanna get back home, right?

166
00:10:01,063 --> 00:10:05,542
I mean, you're probably already falling
behind with the housework, the bills.

167
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:09,454
How many sick days do you think
you'll get before they replace you?

168
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,428
Heart rate's up, but nothing else.

169
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:17,123
They can't fire me if I'm sick.

170
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:20,095
Right, you’re irreplaceable.

171
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:23,937
Who else would they find
qualified to dance with a rodent?

172
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:25,751
How can you even support your family?

173
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:30,118
What happens when those kids grow out
of their clothes, when they get sick?

174
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:31,277
Still no spasm.

175
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,687
They'll take those
kids away from you, Jack.

176
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:39,293
Maybe I should bring them in here right
now so that you can kiss them good-bye.

177
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,662
Can't you see his heart is fine?!

178
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:45,203
Stop torturing him!
What kind of doctor are you?

179
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:51,083
Wonderful, thank you so much. Okay, bye.

180
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,850
- You're just getting here?
- Buses suck.

181
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:58,092
- Where's your car?
- It's a hostage.

182
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,753
Tritter wants me to
testify against House.

183
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:04,519
- You're not going to.
- Is that a question or an order?

184
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,072
Any sort of conviction
will cost House his license.

185
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,579
Which will cost this hospital.

186
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,133
Relax, I'm not gonna mess
with your precious resource.

187
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,863
I told my lawyer to
tell Tritter to go to hell.

188
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:15,965
Marco!

189
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:20,513
Why are all my prescriptions
getting bounced back?

190
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:22,806
Sorry, Dr.
Wilson. I was trying to call you.

191
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,703
- Where's your phone?
- In my car.

192
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:28,118
My patients, on the other hand,
are here and needed their medications.

193
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:31,642
I'm sorry, I can’t.
Your DEA number’s been suspended.

194
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,650
Why so sad?

195
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,452
There's still a chance
that Chase got it right.

196
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:45,388
Oh! That was suspenseful
for about two seconds.

197
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:49,113
Blood culture was negative for bacteria.

198
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:52,005
Positive for hepatitis A?

199
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:55,502
Hmm, I wonder who could
have ordered that extra test.

200
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:59,274
Must be somebody who
knew what persistent vomiting,

201
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:02,012
sudden distaste for nicotine
and itchy feet have in common.

202
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,832
Hep A doesn’t explain the heart attack.

203
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,843
No, but as Chase so deftly
pointed out earlier, puking does.

204
00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:10,035
And hep A explains the puking.

205
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:13,402
If this had been real
life instead of just a game...

206
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:20,477
The DEA just revoked
my prescription privileges.

207
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,988
Who's gonna prescribe my vicodin?

208
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:27,673
Yes, well, that’s why I'm here.
This is a disaster for you.

209
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:30,775
Relax.  Tritter's just getting desperate.

210
00:12:30,786 --> 00:12:33,861
He's got no real evidence.
He's trying to squeeze you into ratting.

211
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:36,332
I'm not gonna let
him squeeze my patients.

212
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,570
They'll be fine.

213
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:40,445
Most of your cancer
medicine sucks anyway.

214
00:12:42,788 --> 00:12:44,863
I'm gonna use your team
to do my prescribing

215
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,627
till this is straightened out.

216
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:51,322
Suddenly this doesn't
seem nearly as dramatic.

217
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,005
Go pump IVIG into the kid.
Cure him and get him out of here.

218
00:12:57,749 --> 00:12:58,836
Hep A?

219
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:01,256
No.

220
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,739
"Chase,” blood test for bacteria.

221
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:08,760
"Foreman, M.R.I." too stubborn to check
the lungs. Cameron, nice try. No spasm".

222
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,976
"But the princess sat and sat and sat".

223
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:20,441
Pretending not to listen,

224
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:27,483
pretending to write in her
journal with the flowers on it.

225
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:33,618
Pretending she didn't like stories about
eight-year-olds who save the world.

226
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,679
I'm 11.

227
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:36,817
Which is why you can
no longer save the world.

228
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,809
- I'm eight.
- Yeah.

229
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,928
We're all completely dependent on you.

230
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:43,250
- Mornin'!
- Mornin'.

231
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:44,586
Good news.

232
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:46,724
We can take you off the IVIG.

233
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:51,193
The hep A has cleared your system.
You'll be good to go by tomorrow.

234
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:54,831
How do you think I got it?

235
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,648
It could have been contaminated food.

236
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:59,118
It could have been from
cleaning bathrooms at work.

237
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,527
Or it could have been...

238
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:05,189
Don't worry. They've heard it all.

239
00:14:05,836 --> 00:14:07,385
Anilingus is a common way.

240
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,538
You should just tell
the people that you've dated

241
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:12,613
they should get themselves checked.

242
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:17,640
Don't worry, I've been too busy chasing
after these guys to go spelunking.

243
00:14:17,644 --> 00:14:18,731
You're gross.

244
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,117
I think.

245
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:24,646
- Does your arm hurt?
- Arm's fine, bro.

246
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:27,694
- Then why is it bleeding?
- It's not, it’s...

247
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:33,752
Raise your arm above your head.

248
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:36,146
Your ear.

249
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,381
And your nose.

250
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,468
High PT and PTT on Jack's
blood panel confirm a coagulopathy.

251
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:53,408
So...

252
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,159
we cure the hep A...

253
00:14:56,582 --> 00:14:59,350
and something else pops up. Interesting.

254
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:03,540
What infections cause DIC?

255
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,908
You okay?

256
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:10,927
I hurt my shoulder
playing fantasy football.

257
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:13,059
Shall we discuss what causes DIC,

258
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,453
or shall we just send the
kid back to his miserable life?

259
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:18,294
- He's not miserable.
- Right.

260
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:21,436
He's thrilled that his parents
are dead and his life is over.

261
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,084
The restaurant's probably teeming
with e.coli, eikenella, and strep.

262
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,143
Kids don't wash their hands
between the potty and the party, and--

263
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:31,149
Or it's a food-borne toxin.
Jack eats at that cesspool every day.

264
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:32,966
Jack's the only one who got sick.

265
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:35,222
Kid's got tattoos, piercings,

266
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:38,446
and probably some nasty
little girl loaned him the hep A.

267
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:40,875
Could have also given
him syphilis or gonorrhea.

268
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,034
- I need one of you.
- Take Cameron.

269
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,647
Your idea was dumb, anyway.

270
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:49,955
Chase, I need you to head back to
that cesspool and get me the kid's puke.

271
00:15:50,477 --> 00:15:54,708
Foreman, do an LP, and have Cameron
run down that potty/party theory.

272
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:56,653
Why don't I just test him?

273
00:15:58,547 --> 00:16:01,131
Let's not discuss this
in front of the help.

274
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:09,762
The amount of vomiting that kid did,

275
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,479
wouldn't be enough toxins left
in this system to show up in his blood.

276
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:17,370
Since he vomited into the
toilet here instead of on somebody,

277
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,533
that restaurant is our
only source of essential vomit.

278
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,926
And you couldn't say
that in front of Foreman?

279
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:25,600
No, I couldn't say
this in front of Foreman.

280
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,338
I need a refill.

281
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:31,779
Detective Tritter knows
about the scrips I wrote before.

282
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,596
Exactly. If you stop now,
it'll look suspicious.

283
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,504
- Does anyone fall for that argument?
- Write the scrip.

284
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,198
No.

285
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,079
One prescription isn't gonna make you--

286
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,268
we both know it’s not gonna be just one.

287
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,217
I'd rather lose my
job than lose my license.

288
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:05,375
Daniel Silvers, prostate cancer,
needs filgrastim, two-week supply.

289
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:11,634
Andrea  Donavan, breast cancer,
just needs her refill of her megestrol.

290
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:15,306
- You're not writing.
- You want me to write?

291
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,930
Well, you could phone them in.
But eventually,

292
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:21,497
yeah, probably somebody's
gonna want something written down.

293
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,480
- I haven't met these people.
- I have.

294
00:17:25,464 --> 00:17:28,276
- I've diagnosed them and everything.
- I know.

295
00:17:29,302 --> 00:17:32,098
I know, I'm not saying
I don't trust you.

296
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,510
Just my diagnosis.

297
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:35,873
These are gonna be my prescriptions, I--

298
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:37,917
They're my patients! My prescriptions.

299
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,015
My name!

300
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:43,871
That Tritter will read on the scrip.

301
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:49,488
He wants to make you miserable. You
don't think he’s gonna ask questions?

302
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:56,125
Is there anything Jack does that
no one else does? Any special duties?

303
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,765
No, we got lots of bussers.

304
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:01,443
What kind of cleaning
products do you use?

305
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,921
We got a bunch of kids running around
sticking everything in their mouths.

306
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,836
So we can't use anything toxic.

307
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:10,802
That's it.

308
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,012
Monday's trash.

309
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:22,947
So there's no one who can maybe...
help get the bags out?

310
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:24,359
Sorry, short-handed.

311
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:26,743
I can tip.

312
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:31,944
I'm pretty sure Jack's puke is in a blue
trash bag with the wrapped gifts. But

313
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:34,661
if you find spaghetti,
that's the wrong vomit.

314
00:18:44,793 --> 00:18:47,899
How much longer do I have
to stay on this medication?

315
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:49,977
I mean, I'm nauseous all the time.

316
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:53,317
Maybe I should go back on the tamoxifen.

317
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:56,527
You're doing so much better
on the anastrozole, Beth.

318
00:18:56,534 --> 00:19:00,439
- I'm reluctant to make a change.
- I can't play with my daughter.

319
00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:04,961
Or pick her up from school. I can
barely get up and tuck her in at night.

320
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,933
There's got to be something else.

321
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,206
Who is she?

322
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,552
Well, as you know,
this is a teaching hospital.

323
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:14,126
She's a student?

324
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:17,359
No, I'm a doctor.
I'm assisting Dr. Wilson today.

325
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:20,157
Why, do you think he
got my diagnosis wrong?

326
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,931
- No, I'm sure--
- No, no.

327
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:26,084
She's just consulting
regarding my prescriptions.

328
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,213
You think he got my meds wrong?

329
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:30,167
- No, it's just--
- No.

330
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:31,927
Then why is she here?

331
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:40,777
What are you doing now?

332
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:45,041
I'm gonna get a sample
of your brother's spinal fluid.

333
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,099
- Where's Will?
- School.

334
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,888
Is that gonna hurt?

335
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:55,075
It's gonna help us figure
out what's making him sick.

336
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:58,620
- Shouldn't you be in class too?
- Teacher work day.

337
00:19:58,726 --> 00:20:00,046
For you, but not Will?

338
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:02,753
Yeah, it didn't make sense to me either.

339
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:08,242
Can I help?

340
00:20:10,053 --> 00:20:14,136
Well, I guess it's quicker than
calling a nurse. And a truant officer.

341
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:18,625
Here, grab his shins.
Push his knees up towards his chest.

342
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:23,528
Now hold him there tight.

343
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:26,723
This all nurses do?

344
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:31,350
My boss doesn't trust
'em to do anything else.

345
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:39,570
Is he gonna die?

346
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,118
No.

347
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:45,751
No one's gonna die.

348
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,739
In the whole world, ever?

349
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,098
That's so great.

350
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,552
- Well, I meant--
- I know what you meant.

351
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:57,308
But I also know bad things do happen.

352
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,048
My dad always had a few
drinks when they went out.

353
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:05,752
Always said he’d be okay to drive.

354
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:08,551
Until he wasn’t.

355
00:21:13,712 --> 00:21:16,122
I would just like
some warning this time.

356
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:24,867
We're nowhere near anything
like that happening right now.

357
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:27,320
Okay?

358
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:32,511
Let's scoot him back over.

359
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:38,371
What was that?!

360
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:40,417
What'd you do?

361
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,734
- You broke his rib?
- I barely touched him.

362
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:46,576
Which means--

363
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:49,500
- Found it.
- Fix it.

364
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:54,106
Osteomyelitis. Means the
infection's spread to his bones.

365
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:57,657
Which means it's either
bacterial or viral, and that--

366
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:03,705
I hired you to take away the pain.
Is there some confusion?

367
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:07,557
You ever thought about using
your cane on the proper side?

368
00:22:07,563 --> 00:22:08,939
Yeah, that's the issue.

369
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,882
Friday night, my cane suddenly
noticed it was on the wrong side.

370
00:22:14,448 --> 00:22:16,738
- Can you score me some vicodin?
- No.

371
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:19,168
I did a needle aspiration
to confirm which--

372
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:20,838
How long till the cultures--

373
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:25,533
Why do you only do
that when I'm talking?

374
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:27,482
You gotta rest your shoulder.

375
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:31,608
And we're gonna get you
on some different equipment.

376
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:48,711
- Nice cane.
- If I know what you mean?

377
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:53,617
- Chase, you can stop doing that.
- I'm almost finished.

378
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:55,295
He's got osteomyelitis.

379
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,587
Means you're wrong
about food-borne toxins.

380
00:22:59,732 --> 00:23:00,821
And...

381
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,850
you can stop too. Syphilis.

382
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:07,885
- You sure?
- Read the printout.

383
00:23:12,702 --> 00:23:14,653
He's also positive for eikenella.

384
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:22,789
One of you two screwed up.

385
00:23:22,797 --> 00:23:24,175
- No.
- Not a chance.

386
00:23:27,284 --> 00:23:29,872
Or this kid is a lot
sicker than we thought.

387
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:31,826
Finish that test.

388
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,579
It should be impossible to
get two right answers to one question.

389
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:38,075
Is it okay to have three?

390
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:41,034
Apparently.

391
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:43,959
He's  positive for botulism too.

392
00:23:44,953 --> 00:23:46,044
So...

393
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:50,415
we knock down one infection
and three more pop up.

394
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:54,371
I think this game is rigged.

395
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:08,817
Jack? Somebody help!

396
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,719
We've managed to clear all
three infections out of his system.

397
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:14,322
But now he's having
seizures every few hours.

398
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:16,273
He's gotta be immuno-compromised.

399
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:19,705
No, white count was normal,
and he was negative for HIV.

400
00:24:19,711 --> 00:24:21,304
If he's not immuno-compromised,

401
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:23,480
why is he acting like
he's immuno-compromised?

402
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:24,906
What do the seizures tell us?

403
00:24:24,912 --> 00:24:27,967
Nothing, there were no structural
abnormalities on the CT,

404
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:31,247
non-focal neuro-exam,
no electrolyte imbalance, nothing.

405
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:36,152
What do unexplained seizures and
really sick 18-year-olds have in common?

406
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,764
You thinking trauma?

407
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:40,171
I'm thinking drugs.

408
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,259
He's an admitted user.

409
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:44,689
Drugs trashed his immune system.

410
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:46,958
Tox screen was clean.

411
00:24:47,263 --> 00:24:50,884
Clean tox screen means there’s
no drugs in his blood or urine.

412
00:24:51,071 --> 00:24:55,443
There could still be drugs trapped
in his fat cells from the good ol' days.

413
00:24:55,975 --> 00:24:58,974
If they're in his fat,
why would they be affecting him now?

414
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:03,177
A keen observer would notice that
he's had some digestive issues lately.

415
00:25:03,446 --> 00:25:04,992
His weight loss could have

416
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:08,827
burned off fat cells and released
the drugs back into his system.

417
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,971
There's no way to know. It's
impossible to test fat cells for drugs.

418
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:16,582
It's not impossible to
make him lose more weight.

419
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:20,957
You want us to starve him so
we can drive him into another seizure,

420
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,407
and maybe a heart attack,
just so we can run another tox screen?

421
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:25,502
That'd be cruel.

422
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:27,838
Just sweat it out of him.

423
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,148
I haven't touched a thing
since the night my parents died.

424
00:25:35,957 --> 00:25:38,194
Drugs stay in your system a long time.

425
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,210
I was high...

426
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:51,718
the night the cops came
to tell us what happened.

427
00:25:55,236 --> 00:25:58,108
You know the first thing
I did when they told me?

428
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:02,124
I laughed.

429
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,212
I'm not the person I was when they died.

430
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:11,284
I wish they could see that.

431
00:26:12,626 --> 00:26:16,131
Well, I'm sure they’re watching,
and I'm sure they’re proud.

432
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,599
That's what Will's guidance
counselor keeps telling him.

433
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:22,895
What do you tell him?

434
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:27,547
I tell him it's crap.

435
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:32,404
Our parents live on in our memories,
but they don't live on.

436
00:26:43,057 --> 00:26:44,142
Jack?

437
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:45,259
Hold him still!

438
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:47,859
- Don't break his arm.
- We'll fix it.

439
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,296
We need to get a sample.

440
00:26:53,841 --> 00:26:54,929
House.

441
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:56,850
Bad news.

442
00:26:57,512 --> 00:27:00,487
Look at you.
Couldn't have sent Cameron down here

443
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:03,928
to this air-conditioned
hallway to deliver the bad news?

444
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:07,831
Jack seized again, but his
blood was clean. Completely drug-free.

445
00:27:08,183 --> 00:27:12,249
So he just happened to have a seizure
at the exact time that we stuck him

446
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:14,458
- in a sauna?
- It's not a coincidence.

447
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:18,832
He's still seizing every few hours,
whether we stick him in a sauna or not.

448
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:20,041
Oh, my god!

449
00:27:21,198 --> 00:27:22,574
Why are you using that?

450
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,129
I've had it for years.

451
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:27,936
No, that's--

452
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:31,905
that's gonna make your shoulder hurt.
You need one of these.

453
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:34,322
He's a... doctor.

454
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:38,535
- Is he still infection-free?
- I'm sure not for long.

455
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,425
My point being that something other than
those infections caused these seizures.

456
00:27:42,432 --> 00:27:44,808
That means there’s something
in his head. Scan him.

457
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:45,903
We scanned him.

458
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:50,401
Well, that was then. This is not then.
Kid keeps changing. Scan him again.

459
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:51,780
Where is Cameron?

460
00:27:52,536 --> 00:27:54,889
I'm not writing you a scrip for vicodin.

461
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,961
I've only got two pills left.

462
00:27:58,092 --> 00:28:00,391
Cut 'em in half. Then you'll have four.

463
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:05,074
You're prescribing for Wilson. Wilson
prescribes for me. Write up a scrip.

464
00:28:05,462 --> 00:28:07,079
You know you have a problem.

465
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,324
Yeah, it's got a badge and everything.

466
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:12,346
- You're taking too much--
- Fine! You’re right.

467
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:14,108
What's the correct amount?

468
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:16,480
Write up a scrip for the correct amount.

469
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:19,028
No answer?

470
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:22,053
That's 'cause we're
having the wrong debate.

471
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,403
This has got nothing to do with
my problem and everything to do with you

472
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:28,613
avoiding a problem. You're afraid
that if you write me a prescription,

473
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:31,361
- you're gonna wind up like Wilson.
- Of course I am.

474
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:37,411
Tritter wants to win by giving pain.

475
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:41,063
Do you really want to be a part of that?

476
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,417
As a doctor, how do you do that?

477
00:28:52,256 --> 00:28:53,343
Here.

478
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,184
This'll tide you over.

479
00:28:55,431 --> 00:28:58,591
Keeps the edge off my PMS,
it will do wonders for you.

480
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:08,029
Why are you looking at my head again?

481
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,795
Seizures usually indicate
something neurological.

482
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:13,565
I'm not gonna get better.

483
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:16,259
Am I?

484
00:29:17,217 --> 00:29:19,055
We'll know more after the test.

485
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:24,400
I've gotta find out who
can take care of Will and Kama.

486
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,699
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

487
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:32,234
You'll be home, yelling at them and
kicking their butts before you know it.

488
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:45,873
This kid might be facing
a terminal disease,

489
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,370
and he's more worried
about his brother and sister.

490
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:49,521
Brain stem's clean.

491
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:53,381
- Nothing in the midbrain.
- What's that?

492
00:29:54,485 --> 00:29:56,781
The frontal lobe, upper-right quadrant.

493
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,852
I don't see anything.

494
00:29:59,446 --> 00:30:00,536
There.

495
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:03,019
It's tiny, but...

496
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:04,747
I think it's a tumor.

497
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:06,531
That size should be excisable.

498
00:30:07,615 --> 00:30:10,145
- Why didn't we see it earlier?
- Oh, god.

499
00:30:11,752 --> 00:30:13,646
Axial view, there's another one.

500
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,574
Bring up the next slice.

501
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,354
They're everywhere.

502
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:27,549
Jack's brain is riddled with tumors.

503
00:30:28,752 --> 00:30:30,240
You know what he's doing?

504
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:33,313
- Moaning?
- Setting up play dates.

505
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:35,682
Wow, what a guy! Theories?

506
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:38,765
The obvious one. Brain cancer
destroyed his immune system.

507
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:40,794
Left him wide open for these infections.

508
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,891
House...

509
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:43,143
you're pathetic.

510
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:47,296
You'll analyze anyone's faults,
hypocrisies, weaknesses.

511
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:49,161
But this kid's got some strength,

512
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:52,635
and all of a sudden there's no time
to talk about anything but the medicine.

513
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:55,627
He's teaching prepubescent
kids that truth matters,

514
00:30:55,637 --> 00:30:58,150
god does not, and life sucks.
I like him.

515
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,719
- Treatment?
- We need to start him on radiation.

516
00:31:01,722 --> 00:31:04,352
And destroy whatever's
left of his immune system.

517
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,561
And safe his life!

518
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,661
I know the notion of
self-sacrifice is foreign to you.

519
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,389
You wanna think he’s sacrificing
himself because if one person can do it,

520
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:17,543
then maybe the world isn’t the cold,
selfish place you know that it is.

521
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:21,318
Radiation could kill him. Alternatives?

522
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,046
There aren't any. We saw the tumors.

523
00:31:24,307 --> 00:31:26,770
We could choose to
say they aren't tumors.

524
00:31:27,282 --> 00:31:28,370
They're just pus.

525
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:31,168
Which would explain why
they weren't there yesterday.

526
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:34,977
It can't be an infection. He got IVIG,
broad spectrum antibiotics--

527
00:31:34,984 --> 00:31:38,113
Exactly. It creates
a perfect world for fungus.

528
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,466
Moves in,
gets married, has little fungi.

529
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:46,085
If you're wrong about the fungus, you're
wasting what little time he has left.

530
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:48,582
Not a big sacrifice. His life sucks.

531
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:53,877
So let's be right.
Go stick a needle in the kid's head.

532
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:57,666
If you suck out a liquid, then I'm
right, and we haven’t answered anything.

533
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:01,552
If you suck out a solid, you're right,
and no more worrying about play dates.

534
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:10,863
Okay, fine. I'll father your child.

535
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:14,825
First, you gotta write
me a vicodin prescription.

536
00:32:14,969 --> 00:32:18,404
- Just so I'd get through the foreplay.
- How many days you have left?

537
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:21,640
Ah, I could probably get
through maybe... next minute or so.

538
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:26,068
And your coming to me means
your lackeys actually stood up to you--

539
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:29,371
- I'm impressed.
- Yes, their cowardice is inspiring.

540
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:31,791
Well, you should be thanking them.

541
00:32:31,975 --> 00:32:34,288
If they caved,
it'd give the cops evidence

542
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:37,507
that you intimidated underlings
to feed your addiction.

543
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:39,905
I hate writing thank-you notes.

544
00:32:40,116 --> 00:32:43,101
Would it be weird if
I asked Cameron to write them?

545
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:44,644
You're hooking me up?

546
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:46,749
Unfortunately, if I cut you off,

547
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:50,006
it'd give the cops evidence that
you don't really need the pain meds.

548
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:53,640
I knew that cleavage was a smoke screen.
You're a genius.

549
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:59,122
- You can't lift your arm.
- You can't pee standing up.

550
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:00,217
Gimme.

551
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:01,572
You been doing physio?

552
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,299
Maybe you pulled--

553
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:05,833
Yeah, been training
for pants off dance off.

554
00:33:05,836 --> 00:33:06,720
Gimme the scrip.

555
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,902
Your shoulder problem isn’t physical.

556
00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:11,818
Well, we'll find out
if you ever give me the--

557
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,912
what's new? What’s different?

558
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:18,009
Any big changes in your life recently?
A fight with the wife, maybe?

559
00:33:18,578 --> 00:33:19,669
It's good.

560
00:33:20,513 --> 00:33:23,685
Means your shoulder’s a human being.
It's a start.

561
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,321
I'm right, right?

562
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,645
Yeah. Just not about me.

563
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:46,665
I was right, right?

564
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:49,808
They were abscesses from
a fungal infection. Aspergillus.

565
00:33:49,816 --> 00:33:51,592
But we still have no idea why.

566
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:54,825
Our kid's immune system
has a factory defect.

567
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:57,867
- It's genetic.
- It can't be genetic.

568
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:00,522
He'd have been getting
infections since he was an infant.

569
00:34:00,526 --> 00:34:02,031
Not if he grew up in a bubble.

570
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:05,151
Or if he grew up on Mars.
No germs there, either.

571
00:34:05,422 --> 00:34:07,233
I don't mean a literal bubble.

572
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:11,651
A sweet, suburban bubble where mommies
and daddies protect their children.

573
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,127
They die, bubble bursts.

574
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:17,073
Continuing emotional trauma
triggers a genetic illness.

575
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,628
Question is, which one?

576
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:22,863
The infections he's contracted
narrow down the possibilities.

577
00:34:23,318 --> 00:34:25,989
Hep A indicates a
problem with his B cells.

578
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,687
Bruton's agammaglobulinemia?

579
00:34:28,957 --> 00:34:31,886
- Eikenella.
- Points to a complement deficiency.

580
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:36,418
- I have a patient. I need--
- Not now!

581
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:39,239
- I'll go.
- You'll stay.

582
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,954
- Patient's dying.
- So is mine.

583
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,644
Not in the next hour.

584
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:46,619
What does the syphilis tell us?

585
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,058
What does it tell us?

586
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:54,980
It could mean chronic
granulomatous disease.

587
00:34:55,264 --> 00:34:59,461
And the aspergillus is a T-cell issue.
Common variable immunodeficiency.

588
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:04,006
Genetic testing's gonna take time.

589
00:35:04,217 --> 00:35:06,286
Given the rate he's
picking up infections--

590
00:35:06,293 --> 00:35:07,839
why don't we turn it into a race?

591
00:35:07,845 --> 00:35:09,840
Little late to be playing games with us.

592
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:13,190
- Not you guys. The infections.
- What infections?

593
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,404
The infections we’re gonna give him.

594
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,538
The only way to cure
me is to make me sicker?

595
00:35:22,682 --> 00:35:26,418
Each of the four possible genetic
conditions is most susceptible

596
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:29,467
to different types of infection.

597
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,257
What's that?

598
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:38,407
This is a cocktail of serratia,
meningococcus, cepacia, and rhinovirus.

599
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:42,965
Whichever germ gains the most
ground plants the flag of its leader,

600
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,598
gives us our answer.

601
00:35:45,264 --> 00:35:48,477
How are you gonna know
which one gains the most ground?

602
00:35:49,153 --> 00:35:50,988
Well, now, that’s the fun part.

603
00:35:51,363 --> 00:35:55,904
See, if the meningococus is king of the
hill, you get to have another seizure.

604
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:59,262
The serratia will shut down your lungs.
If it's cepacia,

605
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:03,441
you'll have a heart attack.
If it's the rhinovirus, you'll sneeze.

606
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,927
Can't all be dramatic. We good?

607
00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:12,452
- Hell, no.
- Well, the alternative is we guess.

608
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:14,975
And there's a three out of four chance

609
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:19,173
that your little brother and sister
will get to cry over another coffin.

610
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,268
Did you study fractions in school?

611
00:36:22,784 --> 00:36:23,868
We good?

612
00:36:40,043 --> 00:36:44,043
This test isn’t exactly FDA approved. So

613
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:47,039
let's just keep it
our little secret, okay?

614
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,607
Little orphan Annie and Oliver
Twist slept in our hallways last night.

615
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:05,159
Are they singing?

616
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:07,741
They're children. They need a guardian.

617
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:10,398
Couldn't find a babysitter.

618
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:12,858
On account of not being
able to make any phone calls,

619
00:38:12,878 --> 00:38:14,735
on account of not being able to breathe,

620
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:17,464
on account of his lungs
filling up with serratia.

621
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,596
He has chronicgranulomatous disease.

622
00:38:20,486 --> 00:38:22,220
Game over. Our work is done.

623
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:26,496
Then he's gonna keep getting sick.
You gotta call social services.

624
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:30,318
Bone marrow transplant would
reboot his whole immune system.

625
00:38:30,326 --> 00:38:33,481
He'll be healthy enough to
win miserable daddy of the year.

626
00:38:33,492 --> 00:38:35,604
So see if one of his kids is a match.

627
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,786
My kids are already testing his kids.

628
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:41,933
Will's a match.

629
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:43,863
You tested him?

630
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:45,882
I never consented--

631
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:48,077
It's just a blood draw.
There's no danger.

632
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,951
To the testing. What about the surgery?

633
00:38:49,972 --> 00:38:52,325
The risk for Will? It's next to nothing.

634
00:38:57,844 --> 00:39:00,716
What if I don't do it?
What are my other options?

635
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:05,595
Your immune system
can’t fight off the germs

636
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,193
we all come into contact with every day.

637
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:12,490
Now that we know, we can use
more targeted medications. But...

638
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:16,436
you'll still get sick all the time.

639
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:20,927
- You'll be in and out of hospitals--
- But I'll live.

640
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:29,054
Jack...

641
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:34,577
your lifespan will
be substantially shortened.

642
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:40,203
And you'll be too sick to care
for your brother and sister anymore.

643
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:42,478
You shouldn't have pressured him into--

644
00:39:42,486 --> 00:39:45,243
- There's no pressure.
- He's eight years old!

645
00:39:45,688 --> 00:39:47,961
You tell him his brother’s
dying unless he helps,

646
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,642
- what do you think he's gonna do?
- He wants to help you.

647
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:51,954
He has no idea.

648
00:39:53,076 --> 00:39:56,582
It's like you asked him to
let me play with one of his toys.

649
00:39:57,624 --> 00:40:00,240
This is surgery. He could die.

650
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:02,078
He'll be fine.

651
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:04,615
But you...

652
00:40:05,459 --> 00:40:09,538
you're gonna have a hard time
protecting him like this if you're dead.

653
00:40:14,024 --> 00:40:15,108
I'll do it.

654
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,011
When Will's 18,
and can decide for himself.

655
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:30,635
Noble.

656
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:32,281
Moronic.

657
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:35,986
It's a synonym.

658
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:39,922
Why can't you accept he
wants to protect his brother?

659
00:40:40,123 --> 00:40:42,880
Has to protect his brother.
He doesn't want to.

660
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:46,151
He wants to run screaming
from protecting his brother.

661
00:40:47,688 --> 00:40:48,831
You're a hypocrite.

662
00:40:52,486 --> 00:40:54,240
Evidence is everything.

663
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:57,590
Truth is all that matters.

664
00:40:58,632 --> 00:41:01,272
Except when it comes to people.

665
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:05,553
Everything we've learned
about this kid says you're wrong.

666
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:08,418
But you can't accept that.

667
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:11,263
It's easy to reject the diagnosis.

668
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:14,623
Not so easy to reject your misanthropy.

669
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,884
Because then you'd have
to give people a fighting chance.

670
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:20,952
And that...

671
00:41:21,742 --> 00:41:23,346
scares the crap out of you.

672
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:26,937
Okay.

673
00:41:29,992 --> 00:41:31,429
Let's get some evidence.

674
00:41:39,535 --> 00:41:40,739
It's your lucky day.

675
00:41:41,536 --> 00:41:45,044
I just found another donor
in the registry. A perfect match.

676
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:48,461
We can do the transplant,
no danger to the rug rat.

677
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:50,406
You just have to sign here.

678
00:41:53,585 --> 00:41:56,404
Unless there's another
reason you don't want it.

679
00:41:57,454 --> 00:41:58,943
There's a chance I'd die.

680
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:01,099
A chance you'll be cured.

681
00:42:02,826 --> 00:42:04,841
Maybe you don't want that, either.

682
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:09,580
Maybe hanging out in a hospital and
getting waited on hand and foot reminds

683
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:13,780
you of what life used to be like
before you were forced to play Mr. Mom.

684
00:42:14,306 --> 00:42:15,735
I don't like being sick.

685
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:18,720
But you don't want to be healthy either.

686
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:21,124
This is your way out.

687
00:42:21,766 --> 00:42:22,850
Guilt-free.

688
00:42:25,216 --> 00:42:27,108
I said I'd do it when Will's 18.

689
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,448
When he's able to take care to himself.
Without you.

690
00:42:32,604 --> 00:42:33,691
Jack...

691
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:36,259
your brother and sister need you.

692
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,619
I know! I know every second
of every day that they need me.

693
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,630
But I'm too young to be their dad!

694
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:53,693
Good for you.

695
00:43:01,652 --> 00:43:03,486
Don't pretend you’re surprised.

696
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:24,481
Wanna go throw stuff
at people off the balcony?

697
00:43:27,222 --> 00:43:28,956
Come on. Mail can wait.

698
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,758
I'm referring my patients
to other oncologists.

699
00:43:32,765 --> 00:43:34,354
I'm shutting down my practice.

700
00:43:34,371 --> 00:43:35,449
Oh, good!

701
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:37,671
‘Cause I was afraid you might overreact.

702
00:43:37,675 --> 00:43:39,616
I can't just ask my patients to wait

703
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:42,769
because Dr. Cameron's boss
won’t let her come out and play!

704
00:43:42,772 --> 00:43:45,992
- I kept you waiting for maybe an hour.
- Three hours!

705
00:43:46,966 --> 00:43:49,653
- Did anybody die?
- Not this time.

706
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:51,524
Cameron's available now.

707
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:53,476
Use her all you want.

708
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:56,672
Oh, so now's a better time
for me to have my life taken away?

709
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:59,778
- It fits into your schedule better?
- Oh, poor you.

710
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:03,727
- You think if you suffer loudly enough
- You committed a crime!

711
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,742
What do you want me to do,
turn myself in?

712
00:44:05,745 --> 00:44:08,146
Yes! Do something! Go in!

713
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:11,301
Show some remorse!
Tell Tritter you'll get some help!

714
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:12,519
I don't need help!

715
00:44:15,046 --> 00:44:16,422
House, get out of here.

716
00:44:18,086 --> 00:44:19,173
Get out of here.

717
00:44:21,597 --> 00:44:26,229
You are not gonna make me feel guilty
about what Tritter is doing... to us.

718
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,599
You already feel guilty.

719
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:32,280
Your mysterious shoulder pain

720
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,530
isn't coming from your cane.
It's coming from your conscience.

721
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,188
That used to be enough.

722
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:44,621
Despite all your smart-ass remarks,
I knew you gave a damn. This time...

723
00:44:47,927 --> 00:44:51,374
you were either gonna help
me through this, or you weren't.

724
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:53,332
And I got my answer.

725
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:13,102
Who's gonna drive me to school?

726
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:15,773
Help me with my homework?

727
00:45:17,252 --> 00:45:19,492
There'll be a mom where they take you.

728
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:22,622
A real mom.

729
00:45:23,411 --> 00:45:24,673
Someone who can cook.

730
00:45:30,638 --> 00:45:33,455
Don't worry.
I'll still be able to see you guys.

731
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,924
You said you’d make him better.

732
00:46:29,942 --> 00:46:31,033
I'm sorry.

733
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:47,721
Thank you for not telling them.

734
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,312
You're a good kid.

735
00:46:53,986 --> 00:46:55,422
Three months from now...

736
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:57,839
six months from now...

737
00:46:59,479 --> 00:47:00,911
you'll be visiting them.

738
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:03,649
And you won't be able to say good-bye.

739
00:47:04,794 --> 00:47:06,745
You're gonna know you screwed up.

740
00:47:08,857 --> 00:47:12,318
You'll take his bone marrow.
And you’ll take them back.

741
00:47:15,048 --> 00:47:17,562
And they'll be a burden and a pain.

742
00:47:19,908 --> 00:47:21,163
And your life will...

743
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,663
never be what it was supposed to be.

744
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:27,218
But you'll be proud of yourself.

745
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:31,673
Your parents...

746
00:47:33,336 --> 00:47:34,772
they'll be proud of you.

747
00:47:39,012 --> 00:47:40,096
I don't think so.

748
00:47:49,347 --> 00:47:50,891
It's what I wanna believe.
