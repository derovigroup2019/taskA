1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,800
Hajime!

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,810
Matte.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,130
She almost took my head off!

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,310
Your fault.
You didn't guard your left side.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,860
Hajime!

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,810
Matte!
Point.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Hajime!

8
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,850
Matte, matte, matte!

9
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,800
Matte, matte!

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,660
Stop, stop, stop!

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,330
Addie...
you're bleeding.

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,770
I never even hit her.

Season 3 Episode 22</font>

16
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,200
good morning.

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,780
This is funny.

18
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,640
- "People don't--"
- not done reading.Go away.

19
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,770
Most likely she coughed it up,

20
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,370
which would mean it's from her lungs.

21
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,940
Drugs, toxins, infection?

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,840
No fever, no elevated white count,
which rules out infection.

23
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,880
And the blood panels found no drugs, no toxins.

24
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,830
The bronchoscopy was pristine.
So much for the lungs.

25
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,340
- Good morning.
- Not yet.

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,070
So then the blood came from her stomach,

27
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,160
which would mean it's an ulcer or a gi bleed.

28
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,530
Er also ran an upper and lower gi.

29
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,990
No occult blood in her stool.

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,060
which means no ulcer or gi bleed.

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,650
Which means it's not from the stomach either,

32
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,210
which means it didn't come from anywhere.

33
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,920
You guys get to the point where the blood
didn't come from anywhere?

34
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,710
Rupture in her sinus cavity?
Drip through the back?

35
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,020
- Not that much blood.
- Trauma from karate?

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,560
No trauma.
Kicked the other guy's ass.

37
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,670
Now a good time?

38
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,020
If you can tell me how blood can mysteriously appear--

39
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,090
now.

40
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,430
This includes you.

41
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,890
What's going on?

42
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,650
Feel free to speculate amongst yourselves.

43
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,300
Are you sure?

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,550
- Yeah.
- Why?

45
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,040
He's afraid of turning into me.

46
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,490
Well, that's a good enough reason.
Sign here.

47
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,350
That's not promising.

48
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,330
Good luck.

49
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,260
- Thank you.
- That's it?

50
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,980
You're not gonna tell him that we're a family,

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,740
and families don't abandon each other?

52
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,430
- You want me to?
- No.

53
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,340
- Would it make any difference?
- No.

54
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,320
Good luck, Dr. Foreman.

55
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,190
So, where were we?

56
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,370
College sophomore coughing up blood.

57
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,030
Not the case, the speculation.

58
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,230
The palace intrigue, the rising self-doubts.

59
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,930
- Did Foreman get a promotion?
- I resigned.

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,900
What?

61
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,730
Personally, I can't believe I've had the same
three employees for three years.

62
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,630
The patient could have a heart problem.

63
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,510
Yes, life goes on.

64
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,290
Look at the eager beaver combing his hair.

65
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,390
Hyperdynamic heart could force
too much blood into her lungs.

66
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,700
She coughed up the overflow.

67
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,500
It wouldn't leave a trace in her lungs
because it's traveling through normal plumbing.

68
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,930
Foreman, go do a stress echo test to see if he's right.

69
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,400
Cameron, check out the dorm, and redo the er labs.

70
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,790
I'll get going on Foreman's farewell party.

71
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,830
Everybody good with a mermaid under the stars theme?

72
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,320
So why are you leaving?

73
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,250
Or is it just some sort of power play?

74
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,020
You can have my parking space and my locker.

75
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,300
Is it about house?

76
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,300
Let me get all sensitive and confide in you.

77
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,260
Addie, pedal harder.
We need your heart rate at 170.

78
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,190
Why wouldn't you want to tell me?

79
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,500
I don't like you.
Never have, never will.

80
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,480
You want me to share some more?

81
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,700
Even if you do hate me, if you found another job, you'd tell me.

82
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,170
If house did something to drive you out of here, you'd tell me.

83
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,810
The fact that you won't tell me means that whatever the real reason is...

84
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,700
you're ashamed of it.

85
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,490
guys...

86
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,350
I'm at 170.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,100
Pulmonary artery looks good.

88
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,700
It's not a heart problem.

89
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,960
- Are you cold?
- No.

90
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,300
- Scared?
- I'm okay.Why?

91
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,860
On your arm.

92
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,330
Addie has goose bumps.

93
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,240
Ooh...
no recovering from those babies.

94
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,590
You don't have goose bumps for no reason.

95
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,540
They're a reaction to the body thinking it's cold.

96
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,150
She wasn't cold-- her temperature was normal.

97
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,160
But her body thought it was, which means...

98
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,890
what, a brain problem?

99
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,170
A messed-up hypothalamus could cause goose bumps,

100
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,150
but they're not gonna cause her to cough up blood.

101
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,290
She has no neurological issues-- she had a shiver.

102
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,550
I think there's an infection.

103
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,300
We've ruled out infection
because no fever, no white count.

104
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,190
I think there's an infection.

105
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,800
Blood goes where it's needed.
An infection likes nice wet places--her lungs.

106
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,690
Start treatment.

107
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,040
All that cool stuff for bacterial,
fungal, and atypical infections.

108
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,730
Get a lung biopsy.

109
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,950
I want to see the little bugger up close.

110
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,580
- Why is Foreman quitting?
- He wants to breed llamas.

111
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,350
Interesting.

112
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,100
You're ashamed of the reason too.

113
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,870
No one writes tamoxifen like you.

114
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,260
Well, I use a G.

115
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,450
Foreman resigned.

116
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,940
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,190
- It's okay, no biggie.
- Right.

118
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,030
He give a reason?

119
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,120
He said he didn't want to end up like me.

120
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,630
I had a brilliant retort.

121
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,180
I can't remember what it was at the moment.

122
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,930
You don't want to end up like you.

123
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,420
Good point.
Can I resign?

124
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,180
What's up with that?

125
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,660
- With what?
- You yawned.

126
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,540
I just told you something interesting,
so you're not bored.

127
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,340
It's 11:00 in the morning,you're drinking coffee, so you're not tired.

128
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,240
I didn't yawn, so it's not a mirror-neuron reaction...

129
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,130
which leaves symptom.

130
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,630
Vasovagal issue.

131
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,360
- Maybe a heart problem.
- My heart's fine.I was up late

132
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,030
You're just deflecting having a conversation about Foreman.

133
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,740
I'm okay with Foreman leaving.

134
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,220
Either you're lying,
or you don't really think he's leaving.

135
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,090
Or you just jumped right to acceptance.

136
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,920
Sorry, I yawned because
I was trying to communicate boredom.

137
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,770
You could try bargaining with him--
give him a raise.

138
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,080
How much do you think it would cost
to make him want to be like me?

139
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,090
Thanks for the coffee.

140
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,150
She seems fine.

141
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,640
- She is fine.
- She coughed up blood.

142
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,470
- Past tense.
- She has diarrhea.

143
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,110
From the antibiotics for the infection.

144
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,260
Lung biopsy says she doesn't have an infection.

145
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,670
Well, then you screwed up the biopsy.

146
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,390
Or you're wrong about infection.

147
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,300
If I'm wrong,then so is her body,

148
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,960
'cause it obviously thinks she's got an infection,

149
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,690
or it wouldn't have gotten better from the antibiotics.

150
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,980
What is pandiculation symptomatic of?

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,070
Yawning's a symptom of fatigue or cholinergic excitation.

152
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,610
Does this have anything to do with Addie?

153
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,720
- Let's say yes.
- cerebral tumor, epilepsy.

154
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,410
Could also be a medication reaction to antidepressants,

155
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,510
or some meds for end-stage liver failure.

156
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,360
Let's say no.

157
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,710
You don't want to leave this job.

158
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,610
three years you've been here, you've never
once laughed at anything he's said.

159
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,590
Because I wasn't kissing his ass.

160
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,890
But now you are?
No.

161
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,070
Now you're nervous.

162
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,020
Uncomfortable about your decision.
It wasn't even that good a joke.

163
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,960
Oh, crap.

164
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,980
Most of your jokes are excellent.
I just meant in comparison.

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,760
Shut up.
I think she may not have an infection.

166
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,690
We better deal with her before she crashes.

167
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,260
- She can't breathe!
- Get off the bed.

168
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,820
We need a crash cart.

169
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,460
- What's happening?
- Let's get her down now.

170
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,660
The pressure's collapsing her lungs.
She's not getting any air.

171
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,310
Oh, my god!

172
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,970
she couldn't breathe because she had a pleural effusion.

173
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,430
Thoracentesis revealed low protein count.

174
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,230
Effusion was transudative, which means
she has cirrhosis of the liver,

175
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,440
or she's in heart failure.

176
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,830
Heart was fine,liver enzymes were normal.

177
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,780
There's something called
"blude" in the pleural effusion.

178
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,340
Oh, it's not "blude,"it's blood.

179
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,130
Ha--which is great.

180
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,540
Not for her, but for me.

181
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,020
Because it means I think it's an infection.

182
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,770
The labs indicated minute traces of blood.

183
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,130
You can't ignore the blood because
it's a minority, can you, Foreman?

184
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,530
if we count the traces of blood as significant,
the differential isn't just infection.

185
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,800
It could be lung cancer,breast cancer, lymphoma.

186
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,050
Great, go tell her she's got one of those.

187
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,940
Or you can tell her that we haven't given her
enough antibiotics for her infection.

188
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,260
Double the dose,and check her lungs.

189
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,210
We checked her lungs,they're clean.

190
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,160
On the outside.

191
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,620
she needs an arteriogram.

192
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,660
It's about my bowel movements.

193
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,680
What isn't these days?

194
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,440
- You sure you want to be here for this?
- We do everything together.

195
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,950
Of course.
The toilet can be a lonely place.

196
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,340
Drop your pants,I'll suit up.

197
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,510
- They float.
- Huh?

198
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,350
My bowel movements.

199
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,570
Honey says they're not supposed to.

200
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,520
I'm a nutritionist.

201
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,890
Yes, i could tell from the cool toe-loop sandals.

202
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,840
Thank you.

203
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,930
You're welcome.

204
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,530
And the natural-fiber clothing,I assume, means some kind of vegetarian denomination?

205
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,510
We're vegans.

206
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,900
At first I was a little concerned about the lack of protein, but

207
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,880
honey showed me you can get it from lots--

208
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,010
well, whatever floats your poop.

209
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,160
And you've been together how long?
Six months?

210
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,910
How'd you know?

211
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,610
Because after six months,poop love fades.

212
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,450
And if you'd been together shorter than that, then--

213
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,650
I'll explain right after this break.

214
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:07,680
Three ten-milligram pills of your finest amphetamines.

215
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,750
arteriogram was normal.

216
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,400
which means her lungs are fine.

217
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,350
what if the clear arteriogram significant?

218
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,040
It is significant.
It means there's no infection.

219
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,520
I think there's an infection.

220
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,660
infections don't come and go.People don't get better then worse in the same treatment.

221
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,510
Unless your body can't finish out the fight.

222
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,480
Maybe goes a couple of rounds,then gives up.

223
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,580
- Why would it give up?
- Maybe its name is Foreman.

224
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,980
Come on,where's that smile?

225
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,690
That laugh that makes the whole world sunny without contributing to global warming.

226
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,520
Maybe she's missing a protein.

227
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,500
Blood panel and enzymes show her proteins are normal.

228
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,040
You can't have tested for every protein.

229
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,850
I can think of at least one you can't test for at all.

230
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,530
Complement factor h deficiency.

231
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,230
If she has that,she's dead.

232
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,750
No way to fend off bacteria.

233
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,890
She'll get one infection after another until her body shuts down.

234
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,690
Maybe we can get ahead of the game.
Manage each symptom as it comes up.

235
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,490
It would give her five miserable years instead of six miserable months.

236
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,830
there's no diagnostic test for complement factor h deficiency.

237
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,600
So we isolate the cells that are yummiest for it.

238
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,020
Stick a needle in her eye.

239
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,340
You're cheating on honey.

240
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,960
What?!
No, I'm not.

241
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,370
Oh, yes, you are.

242
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,230
It's okay.

243
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,280
I get it.

244
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,170
Well, I was gonna say relax,but oddly enough you seem pretty relaxed already.

245
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,410
You're accomplished,you're funny.

246
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,990
Yocan have whatever you want--women are gonna--

247
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,410
he's not cheating with another woman.

248
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,780
He's cheating with another food group.

249
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,770
What?

250
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,770
His floaters float because they're full of fat.

251
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,030
Probably had a big cheese burger for lunch.

252
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,210
- You're eating flesh?
- It's just a hamburger.

253
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,910
- Not all the time.
- You're disgusting!

254
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,980
The soy cakes taste like cardboard.

255
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,010
Unsalted cardboard.

256
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,060
I'm accomplished.

257
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,460
I'm funny.

258
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,940
Can I...
have whatever I want?

259
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,630
Can we wait a second?

260
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,920
- What's wrong?
- I feel good.

261
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,330
Do you really need to put that needle--

262
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,990
you felt good yesterday, and then you almost suffocated.

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,690
And you know that that thing is in my eye?

264
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,330
We think it could be.

265
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,930
If we find it, our hope is that we can treat it.

266
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,740
- You hope?
- Mom.Don't hang on every word.

267
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,020
He said he hopes.
That means he doesn't know.

268
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,990
I just want to understand what's going on.

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,090
We won't know anything until we do the test.

270
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,990
Addie, this all looks really scary, but you'll feel nothing.Okay?

271
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,600
Okay.

272
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,760
You rang?

273
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,270
You called me.

274
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,070
I bought you an espresso.

275
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,950
You've been buying me coffee for a couple of
weeks, I thought I'd pay you back with one.

276
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,100
How did you walk with the
cane and the two coffees?

277
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,610
Why are you suspicious?

278
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,420
Because it's either that or accept the
fact that you've done something nice.

279
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,920
And then I have to deal with the horsemen
and the rain of fire and the end of days.

280
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,730
You think I spat in yours?

281
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,400
Or worse.

282
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,860
I stacked them.

283
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,520
What do you think of me hiring a
nutritionist instead of a neurologist?

284
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,800
They sound almost the same.

285
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,200
I take it you've met a hot nutritionist.

286
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,510
Don't cheapen this.

287
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,230
We had an in-depth conversation
about proteins and fats.

288
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,120
I was about to examine her
boyfriend's rectum.

289
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,810
You asked for a date while your
finger was in her boyfriend?

290
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,850
Got her number.

291
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,180
No,no. No way.

292
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,270
This is an employment application.

293
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,670
She doesn't want to go out with
you, she's looking for a job.

294
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,550
Oh,god,she's 26.

295
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,210
With the wisdom of a much younger woman.

296
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,190
Have you spoken to Foreman?

297
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,370
Several times.
We laugh-

298
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,530
you're gonna lose him.

299
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,110
And that will be depressing...

300
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,490
and will only make me appreciate
all the good things that I do have.

301
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,850
Macular biopsy was negative,
which means you're wrong.

302
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,990
There's no complement factor
h deficiency.

303
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,740
The most likely cause of altering blood
flow in the brain is a clot or a tumor.

304
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,290
We can rule out a clotting issue
because she has a bleeding issue.

305
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,940
Which means we should
be looking for a tumor.

306
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,560
I think there's an infection.

307
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,480
Just because the cells in
her eye aren't dead yet,

308
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,580
doesn't mean they're working.

309
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,850
So why did we do the test?

310
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,670
Because if it had been positive,
it would have proved I was right.

311
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,110
But negative doesn't prove you wrong.

312
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,270
That's the beauty of the test.

313
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,310
She needs an mri of her brain.

314
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,870
Absolutely.

315
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,190
As long as you're scanning, you
mind having a boo for an abscess,

316
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,440
or something caused by an infection?

317
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,640
I didn't expect house to beg me to stay,

318
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,280
but it seems like he's in
a better mood since I quit.

319
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,070
Nothing in the axial view.

320
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,610
You haven't asked me why I'm leaving.

321
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,130
I figured you'd tell
me when you wanted to.

322
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,800
I don't want to be like him.

323
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,710
You're not a jerk.

324
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,100
Thank you.

325
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,250
I mean,sometimes you are.

326
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,250
But I don't think we
can pin that on house.

327
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,730
And you're a better doctor than
when you came through the door.

328
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,960
I'm better at some
things,worse at others.

329
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,740
Again,not house's fault. It's a job.

330
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,510
You're supposed to take
the good, and leave the bad.

331
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,340
It's easier for you.

332
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,890
Why,because you think I
need to toughen up?

333
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,720
You think I'm weak?

334
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,910
Yeah.

335
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,500
See,I am a jerk. I've gotta
get out of here.

336
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,960
What's wrong,Addie?

337
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,980
My head hurts!

338
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,750
Brain's clean. No tumor and no abscess.

339
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,530
We're all wrong.

340
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,750
My head!

341
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,670
My head!

342
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,370
Grody!

343
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,510
Looks like massive tissue death.

344
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,690
Who cares-her head blew
up. How cool is that.

345
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,900
it's not pussy

346
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,770
meaning you don't
think it's an infection.

347
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,990
And you'd be right,
if you weren't wrong.

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
Here we go again.

349
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,400
She's got infections that
come and go,which means-

350
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,000
it means it has to be something else.

351
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,040
Good guess,but no.

352
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,170
It means either she's got a
leprechaun in her colon,

353
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,900
which is playing with the doggy door,

354
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,900
letting bacteria in and out.

355
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,230
Or she's got
complement factor h deficiency.

356
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,360
Are you enjoying this?

357
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,990
I'm saving a
woman's li-

358
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,780
I'm saving a woman's life!

359
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,440
Actually,I'm diagnosing her.

360
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,880
Technically I'm diagnosing her with
something that's gonna kill her,

361
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,590
but other than that
I am saving her life.

362
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,830
An autoimmune problem makes more sense.

363
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,800
You can't explain a
transudative pleural effusion

364
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,550
with giant cell arteritis.

365
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,270
You'd need three white boards
and 100 different-colored markers.

366
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,780
No,it's much more likely she
has an invisible protein

367
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,310
that allowed bacteria to
arbitrarily invade her lungs,

368
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,340
then arbitrarily invade her pleura,
then arbitrarily jump into her head.

369
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,100
If it's autoimmune,she can live.

370
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,200
But we have to give her steroids
now, before her heart ruptures.

371
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,510
If you're wrong and you give
her steroids, she dies now.

372
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,500
Foreman,you want a rundown on how it
feels to go with your gut and kill a person?

373
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,420
We can get into the
whole spiring out of control,

374
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,510
self-doubt,resigning thing.

375
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,910
Do it.

376
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,940
The worst that can happen is you quit.

377
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,210
Cameron,want to explain to the parents why
you'll be holding paddles while he's doing it?

378
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,870
Because if her heart goes
boom, it'll boom right away.

379
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,100
She really has to be awake for this?

380
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,070
If there's a problem, she
can tell us what she feels.

381
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,000
Relax.

382
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,460
We're scared.

383
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,990
I don't want you to be scared.

384
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,810
Then get better.

385
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,740
Okay,sweetie?

386
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,430
We love you.

387
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,090
I'm sorry.

388
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,540
Ready?

389
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,960
Ready.

390
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,720
My patient's about to
have a heart attack.

391
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,080
It's gonna be massive.

392
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,800
Oh,well,that's too bad 'cause I just got
tickets to a stroke on the third floor.

393
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,830
Have you had a conversation with Foreman?

394
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,090
Do me a favor.

395
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,510
You haven't... because then you
would have to confront your own emotions.

396
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,560
Is bile an emotion?

397
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,560
Because I could
definitely feel something here.

398
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,680
Get me some licorice.

399
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,620
This is gonna be the best
heart attack of all time.

400
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,220
Oh,it,wait,wait-

401
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,830
she's gonna shock her.

402
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,820
There's always tomorrow.

403
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,950
You wanted to see me?

404
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,100
Pretty sure the label is straight.

405
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,050
Are you really gonna leave?

406
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,680
Where are you going? You
lined up interviews yet?

407
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,500
I'm not sure.

408
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,560
You're pissed at house-I get it.
You're symbolicating killing him.

409
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,010
Symbolicating?What?

410
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,290
Symbolic-a-lating-gosh,that's
a hard word.

411
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Are you okay?

412
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,940
Hey,I'm not the one sym-
I'm not the one symb-

413
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,460
I'm not the one pretending to kill someone.
What would it take for you to stay? Is it money?

414
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,410
- He wants you to stay.
- He said that?

415
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,750
If I said he said that,would that
make a difference?

416
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,990
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Hello?

417
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,200
Ugh,I'm leaving now.

418
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,680
I'm late for a breast
thing. You know he wants you.

419
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,760
You know he's good;you
know he can make you good.

420
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,740
I don't know what I'm
saying. You don't-I don't-

421
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,130
you know what I'm saying and
you know I'm right. I gotta go.

422
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,890
Sorry it took me so
long to get down here.

423
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,670
I'm Dr. Wilson. I guess Dr.
Stein's gone. Don't worry about it.

424
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,220
I'll talk to him when we're done.

425
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,670
Dr. Stein said they're
probably calcium deposits.

426
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,880
Well,with your medical history
you don't want to take any chances.

427
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,340
I can't seem to put on my
gloves today. It's weird.

428
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,270
Okay,well... that's fine. One's
enough. Well,let's have a look.

429
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,270
You sure talk fast.

430
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,450
This is nothing. You should
see me when we're busy.

431
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,870
I just winked at you. I just-I've
never winked at a patient in my life.

432
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,180
I have no-I am so sorry. I
have no idea what I was thinking.

433
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,060
It's okay.

434
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,740
No,it's not. I was hitting on you.
I wasn't consciously hitting on you,

435
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,700
but what else could you think?

436
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,010
That you were being reassuring?

437
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,300
Yeah,that would make
sense. On the other hand,I-

438
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,310
I feel like my heart's gonna explode.

439
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,040
Are you okay?

440
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,310
I feel a little sweaty. Am I sweating?

441
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,750
Yeah.

442
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,980
Is something wrong?

443
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,790
I can't-i
can't-

444
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,750
I put on gloves to do a
breast exam-perfect. Sorry.

445
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,140
It's 185.

446
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,140
185.

447
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,700
185?

448
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,530
Excuse me,I have to go kill
someone.

449
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,350
You dosed me!

450
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,550
Yes,I did.

451
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,030
But only because you didn't
trust me, your best friend.

452
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,620
You could've killed me!

453
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,080
Amphetamines aren't gonna kill you.

454
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,160
You don't know my medical
history. I-I could've-

455
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,150
you could've given me a heart attack.

456
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,640
A heart attack is not gonna kill
you. You were in a hospital.

457
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,620
A- ha! You yawned.

458
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,230
A- ha...

459
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,500
you tried to kill me.

460
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,250
I put you on uppers,and
you still yawned.

461
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,710
Means it's a symptom
of being a big,fat liar.

462
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,110
Yawning is a side effect of
some anti-depressants-

463
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,350
apparently the ones you're on.

464
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,710
I'm not on
anti-depressants;I'm on speed.

465
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,490
That means it's a symptom of cerebral
tumor. You got six weeks to live.

466
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,590
Mr. Well-adjusted is as
messed up as the rest of us.

467
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,930
Why would you keep that a secret? Are you
ashamed of recognizing how pathetic your life is?

468
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,380
It's not a secret,house!
It's-it's-

469
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,370
it's personal!

470
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,390
How long has it been personal?

471
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,450
It's personal!

472
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,090
Yawning's recent, so either you just
started or you changed prescriptions.

473
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,380
This is why I take them.

474
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,030
They're anti-depressants.
Not anti-annoyance-ants.

475
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,030
You'd think this would
naturally come up in conversation.

476
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,250
Oh,don't act hurt. You don't care.

477
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,980
On one of those occasions when you're
pompously lecturing me on what to do to fix my life.

478
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,900
You wouldn't take them.

479
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,620
You'd rather od on vicodin or
stick electrodes in your head

480
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,550
because you could say you
did it to get high.

481
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,670
The only reason to take anti-depressants
is because you're depressed.

482
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,200
You have to admit that you're depressed.

483
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,280
Gimme.

484
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,910
- Are you gonna admit that
- nope.

485
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,510
I'm gonna prove that I'm not depressed.

486
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,650
Well,I can't give you my prescription.
You've got to meet with a psychiatrist.

487
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,450
You need a whole work-up.

488
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,930
Give me a vicodin so I don't stroke.

489
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,500
I... Wouldn't drink that.

490
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,130
My leg hurt,and I...

491
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,330
House.

492
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,300
Why didn't you pick up the
phone? We've been calling.

493
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,490
I was sleeping.

494
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,810
What did you do?

495
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,100
Nothing.

496
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,640
This is how regular people
look when you wake them up.

497
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,060
Chase was wrong.

498
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,260
Addie's kidneys shut down.

499
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,030
hemolytic uremic syndrome
shut down Addie's kidneys.

500
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,210
Peripheral smear of red
cells had schistocytes.

501
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,470
Huh.

502
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,590
Hus is usually caused by an
infection or a protein deficiency.

503
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,050
What a coincidence.

504
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,280
I know a patient with an infection
and a protein deficiency.

505
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,590
You think it's possible
there's a connection?

506
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,220
I want to hear you say
it,chase. It will please me.

507
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,190
Doesn't mean you're right. You predicted
cardiac arrest- instant cardiac arrest.

508
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,940
There were only two choices.

509
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,230
Since yours was wrong,mine
must've been right.

510
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,800
Either that or we missed the
leprechaun.

511
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,090
if you're right,there's
nothing to be done.

512
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,370
The steroid treatment we gave her means
when the next infection hits, it'll hit hard.

513
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,170
Liver failure,cardiac
arrest-

514
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,330
on the bright side,it
confirms my diagnosis.

515
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,680
Don't you see how
incredible this call was?

516
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,730
A protein deficiency.

517
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,480
Can't be tested,can't be seen.

518
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,580
I called it based on coughing blood.

519
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,620
You're happy about this.

520
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,090
She's going to die.

521
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,580
That's not my fault.

522
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,510
She's gonna die anyway.

523
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,030
But now,thanks to me,at
least she'll know why.

524
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,270
I'm sure you'll see that gratitude
in her eyes when you tell her.

525
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,690
I'm not telling her.

526
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,390
No one's telling her. Not
'til we're sure I'm right.

527
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,410
But we're gonna wait for her to stroke or have
a heart attack to confirm before we tell her.

528
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,140
Seems like the humane approach.

529
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,070
Her heart went into v-fib.

530
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,680
Brought her back.Barely.

531
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,690
Congratulations.
You have your confirmation.

532
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,790
What's her name?

533
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,360
- Who?The co-ed?
- Sure.

534
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,250
Dead sophomore girl?

535
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,610
- You know her father's name?
- Dad.Her mother's name is mommy.

536
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,740
Ben and jodie are about to lose their
only daughter,Addie.

537
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,300
You think they're gonna give a crap
if I know their names?

538
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:36,150
Five years from now when the father's looking at
photographs of his daughter graduating from high school

539
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,210
they're not gonna remember the nice black doctor who
called them by their first name.

540
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,700
You don't wanna quit.

541
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,670
- You saying you don't want me to quit?
- Didn't sound like I said that.

542
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,400
I'm saying that suddenly you're trying to turn
me into a kinder,gentler ass.

543
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,040
'Cause you know who you are.

544
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,280
And you figure if you can make me decent and caring,
then maybe there's a hope for you--

545
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:07,680
you are about to tell a girl she's dying.
And you think it's about you.

546
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,090
God,I hope I'm not you.

547
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,550
I'm sorry.

548
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,920
Addie,you're dying.

549
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,870
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

550
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:49,470
Your infections will get worse.
The toxins will spill into your blood.

551
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,790
- How long?
- Two days...Maybe less.

552
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,380
- You have a condition called-
- it doesn't matter.

553
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:04,070
- It's,um,a very rare protein deficiency-
-I don't want to hear it.

554
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,960
Okay.

555
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,440
It's what's killing you.
This is what's killing you.

556
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,500
You're not interested in what's killing you?

557
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,960
Will that make any difference?
Will I live any longer?

558
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,170
Please,could you just leave?

559
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,500
What's the point of living without curiosity?
Without craving the--

560
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:47,570
so i'm screwing up my last few hours
because I won't listen to you?

561
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,330
- Get out of here.
- It's--it's--it's like the...

562
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,510
- Dark matter in the universe.
- You're smiling.

563
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,250
No,I'm not.

564
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:04,880
You can only diagnose a problem by looking at what's
--missing.

565
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:13,250
Oh,god.I have to go.

566
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,640
Nineteen-year-old didn't want to hear the coolest
explanation of why she's gonna die.

567
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,980
Begged me to shut up.

568
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,180
If you can't shut up,at least talk quietly.

569
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,340
Amphetamine withdrawal's a bitch.
She thought that I was happy.

570
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,360
- You were happy.
- No,I was hazy.

571
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,940
I don't get hazy on vicodin or anything else
I throw down.

572
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,750
Which means I was throwing down something
I didn't know I was throwing down.

573
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,260
Which got me to wondering...
Why didn't you give me those happy pills?

574
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,830
- I told you;you gotta be checked out-
-no,you just didn't want me double dosing.

575
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,630
You dosed me!Those coffees--

576
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,690
they worked.You've been smiling. Relaxed...Happy.

577
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,800
A dying girl thought I was happy.

578
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,850
A moron thought I was happy.
Who the hell doesn't want to know why she's dying?

579
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,980
- House was happy.
- Hazy.

580
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,250
- Happy.
- Hazy!

581
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,430
Oh,right,a dying girl mistook hazy for happy.

582
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
Because dying people see happiness everywhere.

583
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,340
- She's miserable.
- She wasn't miserable.

584
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,640
Of course she was miserable.

585
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,660
- You just told her she-
- she's no different than she'd ever been.

586
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,040
She's no different than she'd ever been.

587
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,590
Oh,god.I gotta go.

588
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,280
I need a minute with your daughter.

589
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,920
- Dr.House,get out of here before-
- she's gonna live.

590
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,970
Does that help?Now get out.

591
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,730
- Are you jerking us around?
- Get out!

592
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,460
You...Have got leprechauns in ya.

593
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Depression manifests in lots of different ways.

594
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,810
Some people can't get out of bed all day.

595
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,980
Others have serial relationships and
become oncologists.

596
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,530
- I'm dying;I'm not depressed.
- Wrong and wrong.

597
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,810
You tried to kill yourself by throwing
down kitchen cleanser.

598
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,510
Now,most normal suicidal morons would've
just drank the stuff.

599
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,980
Burn the hell out of their mouth and throat.
Painful,but not deadly.

600
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,990
But being a college-educated,suicidal moron,

601
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,560
you wrapped it in gel caps or
gum which left no trace.

602
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,780
It burned a hole in your intestine.

603
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:57,220
But the body can repair almost anything...
Which is cool.

604
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,220
In your case,scar tissue closed up the hole.

605
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:04,500
But it also formed a bridge between a vein
and an artery.

606
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,230
Now,veins are supposed to help the intestine
flush bacteria away.

607
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,300
But the bridge allowed the bacteria entrance to
the artery where they got a free ride everywhere.

608
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,500
Can you fix me?

609
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,140
Surgery can fix the bridge.
Take about two hours.

610
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,530
Psychotherapy's gonna take you a little longer.

611
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,040
Why'd you do it?

612
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,360
I don't know.

613
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,500
I just...have never been happy.

614
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,820
Please don't tell my parents.

615
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,270
They'll blame themselves,
and it's not their fault.

616
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,860
Please,you can't tell them.

617
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:12,410
Technically,all you have to do is promise
me that you won't do it again.

618
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,080
Then legally,I can't tell them.

619
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,080
I promise.

620
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,280
Yeah.Sure.

621
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,190
- We can't thank you enough-
- your daughter tried to kill herself.

622
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,860
That's why she's here.

623
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,940
Legally,I'm supposed to keep that
between me and her.

624
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,410
Which makes sense.
She's obviously an adult.

625
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,830
Capable of her own well-reasoned decisions.

626
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,130
You're sure?

627
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:29,070
If she doesn't die in the next couple of hours...
Yeah,I'm right.

628
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,840
How could she hide this?

629
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,060
Everyone has secrets.

630
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,160
We'll take care of her.
Figure it out.

631
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,830
- Make her happy?
- Get her into therapy.

632
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,130
Might want to try some meds too.

633
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:04,100
Can we call you?
If we have any questions.

634
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,280
No.

635
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,510
- 'Sup?
- Nothing.

636
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,420
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

637
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,550
House's patient.

638
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,870
Yeah,the one that would've died if not for him.

639
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,720
- Subtle.
- Thanks.

640
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,520
You're really scared you'll turn into him.

641
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,640
Don't tell me I'm better than him.
Don't tell me take the good,leave the bad.

642
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,560
Cameron already tried.

643
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:46,700
I'm telling you there are worse things to turn into.

644
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,500
It's not worth it.

645
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,340
- I didn't think you were gonna show.
- Sorry.

646
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,540
Surgery went a little late.

647
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:25,190
So you really think I have all
the necessary qualifications?

648
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,330
I can't discuss this with a dry mouth.
What do you got there?

649
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,870
Peppermint tea.

650
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,280
I'm going to have a mug of peppermint tea,please.

651
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,080
This isn't a job interview,is it?

652
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,330
It's some kind of interview.

653
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,900
You're judging me,I'm judging you.

654
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,350
You have the upper hand.
I don't know anything about you.

655
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:00,820
I'm on anti-depressants 'cause a doctor
friend of mine thinks I'm miserable.

656
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:05,880
I don't like them.They make me hazy.
I eat meat.I like drugs.

657
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,910
And I'm not always faithful to the women I date.

658
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,460
You don't seem depressed.

659
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:17,680
You do realize you just skipped over
several deep character flaws

660
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:20,290
that most women would run screaming from.

661
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,350
- You told the truth.
- Yeah.

662
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,890
I don't always do that either.

663
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,370
Well,how miserable can you be saving lives,
sleeping around,and doing drugs?

664
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:36,380
Were you on the debating team in high school?

665
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:45,910
Also...I hate...Tea.

666
