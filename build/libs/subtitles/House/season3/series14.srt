1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,700
I'm okay,
let's just go home.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,900
You're getting checked out.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,200
I tripped on the ice.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,300
Eight other kids tripped.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,900
This is embarrassing.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,400
You said you were just gonna
hang with your friends.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,700
I turn around
and you're out there on the ice.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,100
I'm fine.

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,300
You don't know that.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,900
You fell.

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Awkwardly.

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,400
No, I didn't.

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,800
You don't know
how to fall.

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,900
I'm 16,
I've been falling a lot.

15
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,700
<i>I think I'm getting
the hang of it.</i>

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,000
And I checked.

17
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,500
And now the doctors
are gonna check.

18
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,400
You don't think
that you're overreacting?

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,300
I don't need you
to fix every boo-boo.

20
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,600
Then stop getting them.

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,900
I was just playing around
with my friends.

22
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,800
<i>I was having fun.</i>

23
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,600
You know you can't do that.

24
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,900
Oh, I can't have fun?

25
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,300
You know what I mean.

26
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,200
I'm gonna have a talk
with your friends

27
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,800
No!
and tell them that they need to stop...

28
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,400
No.

29
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,700
I don't want you
freaking them out.

30
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,900
Fine.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,900
Fine, we'll go
to the hospital,

32
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,200
but they're gonna tell you
that I'm fine.

33
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,900
and they're gonna tell you that
you don't need to worry about...

34
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,600
Mom!

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,700
Mom?

36
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,500
Mom.

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,700
Hello!

38
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,000
Mom, you gotta wake up.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,700
No one's coming.

40
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,700
Mom!

41
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,100
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

42
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,000
We got into an accident
along the canal road

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,400
just outside Kingston.

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,700
My mom's unconscious.

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,600
<i>Are you okay?</i>

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm fine.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,800
Mom.

48
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,700
Mom.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
HOUSE 314

52
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Where's Foreman?

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,800
He's down here somewhere.

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Somewhere.
Very helpful.

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,600
Do you have any idea
when he's getting out tonight?

56
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,800
Sometime.

57
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,300
I realize you can't predict,

58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,500
I just thought you might
be able to estimate.

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
It's Valentine's Day.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,700
I've planned
a surprise getaway.

61
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,600
Getaway.

62
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,900
Getaway.

63
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,600
Get away.

64
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,800
Is my mom okay?

65
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,400
She's gone to surgery.

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,700
<i>Foreman.</i>

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Your girlfriend
wants to know

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,700
if you're available
for Valentine's.

69
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,900
Act surprised.

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,900
What are you doing DOWN HERE?

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,900
There's a snowstorm.

72
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,100
E.R.'s short staffed.

73
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,100
We're all
supposed to be here.

74
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,600
<i>You're supposed
to be here.</i>

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,700
And you're an ass.
Act surprised.

76
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,500
This could sting a little.

77
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,600
Ow!

78
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,700
Can we hurry this up?

79
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,400
Make sure that... Take your time.

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,300
What's your name?

81
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,600
Hannah Morganthal.

82
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,200
You have CIPA,

83
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,500
<i>Hannah Morganthal.</i>

84
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
No, I don't.

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,100
<i>We have to do x-rays
to make sure</i>

86
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
you don't have
internal injuries.

87
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,800
<i>Blood tests to make sure
no infections.</i>

88
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,900
EEG for
neurological anomalies.

89
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,800
<i>And...</i>

90
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,300
biopsy a spinal nerve.

91
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,000
Whoa whoa whoa.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,500
Congenital insensitivity
to pain

93
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,800
<i>is one of
the rarest conditions on the planet.</i>

94
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,800
<i>There's only been about...</i>

95
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,500
<i>60 documented cases...</i>

96
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,400
Yeah, and I have
seven reasons

97
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,800
to think she's one of them.

98
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
She says she's not.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,500
That's reason number one.

100
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,000
<i>She knew what it was
without us telling her.</i>

101
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Two, she's still wet
from the snow,

102
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
but she's not shivering.
That's odd.

103
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,700
Unless she can't sweat
or feel hot and cold.

104
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,300
The ambulance was warm.

105
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,900
I want
to see my mother.

106
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,500
Three, scarring around
the lips and tongue.

107
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,000
<i>When she was a baby, she chew on herself
without feeling it.</i>

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,900
I fell through a window
when I was a kid.

109
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,700
Four, when you cleaned
the wound,

110
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,200
she flexed into the cleaner
instead of away from it.

111
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,000
It's hard to fake pain
when you've never felt it.

112
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,200
<i>Takes an imaginative leap,Ms. Morganthal.</i>

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,200
That's one of
them Jew names.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,100
Ashkenazis
are a higher risk group.

115
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,500
One the other hand,
she says she doesn't have it.

116
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,000
And she'd be dead by now
if she'd never been diagnosed.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,900
They killed our Lord.

118
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,500
You gonna trust them?

119
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,300
She wants
to see her mom.

120
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
If she admits
having CIPA,

121
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,500
she knows we're not
letting her go anywhere without a battery of tests.

122
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,900
You said
you had seven reasons.

123
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,800
I pulled a number
out of the air.

124
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,100
What, five isn't enough?

125
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,900
Five lame reasons aren't.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,100
I'm taking her
to see her mom as soon as--

127
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,100
I can hit her again
if six isn't enough.

128
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,400
Do the tests.

129
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,700
Need to bail on the E.R.

130
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,700
<i>I got a case.</i>

131
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,500
Why are you
wearing perfume?

132
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,100
Is this a real case or one of those
imaginary cases

133
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,600
that happen
when you're bored?

134
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,400
CIPA.

135
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,900
CIPA is a diagnosis.

136
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,000
Diagnoses happen
at the end of cases.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,300
She's got no idea
what's going on In her body.

138
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,800
There's gotta
be something wrong.

139
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,800
In other words, she could
be perfectly healthy,

140
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,100
<i>but you're curious
about someone</i>

141
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,800
<i>who can't feel pain
because you always feel pain.</i>

142
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,400
So you wanna go exploring.

143
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,700
She was
in a car accident.

144
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,800
She needs x-rays,
blood tests, EEG,

145
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
nerve biopsy.

146
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,100
I also note that,
althounow was coming down in sheets this morning,

147
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,500
you left your hat at home
and used ear muffs.

148
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,000
Do your tests
except for the--

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,200
So while everyone else
was just worrying

150
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
about getting in,
you were concerned with hat-head.

151
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,600
Blind dates are never
a good idea.

152
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
<i>Only reason to wear
a scarf like that</i>

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,900
is as a beacon
to identify you in a crowd.

154
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,600
Do your tests.
Except the nerve biopsy.

155
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
I need the nerve biopsy.
You'd risk
paralyzing her.

156
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
But it's neurological.

157
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
You have no evidence of that.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,700
She tripped.

159
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,600
Do you have any evidence
other than the fact

160
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,500
that a typically clumsy
CIPA patient

161
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,000
tripped on an icy day?

162
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,600
If the EEG
reveals a problem,

163
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,700
we can talk then.

164
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
You could have
left the scarf at home

165
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,100
and just told him you'd be
wearing a look of desperation.

166
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,300
Spiking on leads C3
and O2.

167
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,200
She could
be going into a seizure.
I'm fine

168
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,900
I think there's
a simpler explanation.

169
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,800
<i>You're not gonna ???</i>

170
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,100
I'm fine I wanna see my mom!

171
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
So sedate her.

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,200
She won't consent.

173
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,600
She's a teenager.

174
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
No dad,
mom's still in surgery.

175
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,400
What do you want us to do,
hold her down?

176
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,700
Only until you inject her
with a sedative.

177
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,900
Then you can let her go.

178
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,900
We tried.

179
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Seriously?

180
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,200
She's strong
and doesn't care.

181
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
We'd have broken something

182
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,500
<i>before we could get her
to sit still enough to inject her.</i>

183
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,100
So break her arm.
She won't mind.

184
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,400
You're cranky.

185
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,700
I'm in pain.

186
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Come on,
let's go break her arm.

187
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,600
Nurse Shortie,
your biz-nitch.

188
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,300
How long
you gonna waste her time?

189
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,000
So glad
we're walking somewhere.

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,100
Another 60 feet
and this conversation is over.

191
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,400
When you guys
are out of this program,

192
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,600
Cameron will find somebody,

193
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,500
Chase will find
eight somebodies,

194
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,600
and you'll be alone.

195
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,200
30 feet.

196
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,500
You'll date and you'll date.

197
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,200
But you're
the ultimate Darwinian.

198
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
You've got to fight
for everything.

199
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Anybody else
would just slow you down.
Yeah.

200
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,700
I'm still with her,
aren't I?

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,800
Yeah.

202
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,500
I can only imagine
it's because she hasn't given you an excuse
to break up

203
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,200
and you don't have the guts
to recognize your own reality.

204
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,300
I wanna see my mother!

205
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Hi again.

206
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,700
Not sure I can say this
without being condescending,

207
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,000
but then you'd get
the false impression

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,400
that I respect you,
so...you're a kid.

209
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,300
You're scared,
you're stalling.

210
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,300
Grow up.

211
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm not scared.
I'm never scared.

212
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,500
See?
How juvenile was that?

213
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,400
<i>You can't feel pain.</i>

214
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,000
Nothing left but pleasure.

215
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Why don't you tell me
how wonderful that is?

216
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
It sucks.

217
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,800
Better than being in pain
all the time.

218
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Get in the chair.

219
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,500
Every morning
I have to check my eyes

220
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,600
to make sure I didn't
scratch a cornea in my sleepmy

221
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,200
Oh, God, stop.

222
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,900
I'm in a pool of tears here.

223
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,100
I can't cry

224
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,300
Neither can I.

225
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,300
Every morning,

226
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,100
I check my eyes
for jaundice.

227
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,600
In case the Vicodin's
finally shot my liver.

228
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,900
I can't run anywhere
without examining all my toes for swelling.

229
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,200
I can't run.

230
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,900
Boys can't hold me
for too long because I can overheat.

231
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,600
Girls can't hold me
for too long

232
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,100
because I only
pay for an hour.

233
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,800
<i>(Hannah)
I need an alarm on my watch</i>

234
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,700
to remind me
to go to the bathroom.

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,700
You know how many
humiliating experiences before I thought of that?

236
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,500
The bathroom's
50 feet from my office.

237
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,900
Every drink of water,
I weigh the pros and cons.

238
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,100
After everything I do,
I self-check.

239
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,700
<i>Mouth, tongue, gums,
for cuts.</i>

240
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,400
Count teeth,
check temperature.

241
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,200
Fingers, toes, and joints
for swelling.

242
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,700
<i>Skin for bruises.</i>

243
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,900
I got shot.

244
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,200
I sat on the stove
when I was three.

245
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,800
Wanna see the coil marks?

246
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,400
Yeah.

247
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,300
You think I'm lying?

248
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,100
You think I just wanna
check out your tuchus,

249
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,600
as your people would say?

250
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,600
Get in the chair
and run the damn tests.

251
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,200
If she moves again,
give her nitrous.

252
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,500
You weren't shot
because of lege ain,you were shot
because you're a jerk.

253
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,200
Some think the two
are connected.

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,300
He didn't have to do that.

255
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,500
Yeah, he did.

256
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm sick?

257
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
No, you EEG was normal.

258
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,200
X-ray showed no breaks.

259
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Blood test
showed no infections.

260
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,700
Urine indicated no...

261
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,700
Hannah?

262
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,300
Call a code!

263
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh, God.

264
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,700
Need ice packs
and cooling blankets.

265
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,500
Got saline in there?

266
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,100
She's not flush,
she's not sweating.

267
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,200
You must be--
She has a temperature of 105.

268
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,200
Wow, she's actually sick.

269
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
We got her temperature
down below boiling.

270
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,900
Could be infection.

271
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,400
No, LP showed normal proteins
and no white blood cells.

272
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
High bilirubin.

273
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,600
Could be a liver problem.

274
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,700
Nope, transaminases
were normal.

275
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,900
Could be drugs. She's smoked pot
since she was 11.

276
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,700
No again.
Tox screen was clean.

277
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,100
We're doing this case
backwards.

278
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,700
We do the tests
and then she gets sick?

279
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,300
Maybe we did something
to her.

280
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,600
<i>Maybe she got sick
after the tests.</i>

281
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,900
We should re-run them.

282
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,800
And biopsy a spinal nerve.

283
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,400
You wanna risk paralysis because she's got
a fever?

284
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,400
I want to risk paralysis

285
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,300
because I don't know
what's causing t fever.

286
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,200
???
It's a fever!

287
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,600
In a CIPA patient.

288
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Obviously, things
are a little different in her upstairs wiring.

289
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,200
And have been
since the day she was born.
Yeah.

290
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,000
It's much more likely
that whatever it is

291
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,900
was cleverly waited in hiding

292
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,500
until you guys
were done testing.

293
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,300
Were are you going?

294
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,900
You're all
against this, right?

295
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,700
<i>And you're all gonna stand on principle
and refuse to do it, right?</i>

296
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,600
I'm going
to get Cuddy's approval.

297
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,000
<i>(Cameron)
How long are we gonna
keep Hannah in the dark about her mother?</i>

298
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,200
<i>(Chase)
Long as possible.</i>

299
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,900
Side airbag
should be standard.

300
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,600
I'm sure she'll agree.

301
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,700
<i>(Cameron)
She should know
her mother's situation.</i>

302
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,000
Breaking that news
is that surgeon's problem.

303
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
Any word from House?

304
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,500
No.

305
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,700
Maybe Cuddy will say no.

306
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,600
[laughs]
Cuddy never says no.

307
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
That's not true.

308
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,400
Nobody ever says no.

309
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,700
<i>We don't say no.</i>

310
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,900
You don't say no.

311
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,000
He'll come back,
he'll browbeat us,

312
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,300
he'll give us seven reasons,

313
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,400
and eventually we'll fold.

314
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
We all will,
not just me.

315
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,400
The only way we can avoid
biopsying this kid's spine

316
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
is to find the answer
some other way.

317
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,600
All the tests were negative.

318
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,700
We need a better history.

319
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,400
How much more paperwork
do you need?

320
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,300
We've got pediatric records,a few dozen E.R. records,

321
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,100
our own
admission questionnaire.

322
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
What's the first question?

323
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,800
Insurance coverage.

324
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,400
Okay, second question.

325
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,500
Just make your point.

326
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,800
Where does it hurt?

327
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
If we knew where it hurt, we could diagnose her.

328
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,800
You do know CIPA means
she can't feel pain.

329
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,700
No, CIPA means
she's insensitive to pain.

330
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,300
<i>She still has scattered
nerve fibers that could conduct pain,</i>

331
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,000
<i>but the signals don't make it to the brain.</i>

332
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,000
What if we give her
more pain signals?

333
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,500
<i>A lot more pain signals.</i>

334
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,100
Maybe some of them
will make it through.

335
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,200
You wanna torture her?
No.

336
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,400
<i>Yes. We do this
to anybody else, it's torture.</i>

337
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,000
Doing it to her
is no different than pricking her finger.

338
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,300
<i>We keep poking sharp sticks
into her,</i>

339
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
<i>eventually
we'll find the part that's already tender.</i>

340
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,500
So what does
a Dean of Medicine do?

341
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,200
Oh, can we please
not talk about that?

342
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,700
<i>I will
talk about anything else.</i>

343
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm just trying
to get away from work.

344
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,400
Metaphorically.

345
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,100
Because geographically, the coffee place
around the corner

346
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,900
from the hospital
probably isn't the furthest you could get.

347
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,300
Well, the snow.

348
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,900
Roads are clearing.

349
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,400
But it's a good place
to beat a retreat from.

350
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,700
You usually expect
your dates to go wrong?

351
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,000
Experience has taught me
to have an escape route.

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,400
Well, low expectations,
that's in my favor.

353
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,400
Whatever happens...

354
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,600
<i>I need you to understand</i>

355
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,100
that there are certain aspects
to my life

356
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,300
I'm no happy about.

357
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,100
I need the nerve biopsy.

358
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,500
And you had to come here
personally to tell me that.

359
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,300
And how did you even know
I was here?

360
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,300
I had to bring the file.

361
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,600
<i>This was the most noncommittal location
in walking distance.</i>

362
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,500
You left your car keys
on your desk.

363
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Greg House!

364
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,700
You two must have met
online.

365
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,400
Either that or you've got
a friend who secretly hates you.

366
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,000
Uh, Don Herrick.

367
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,700
Yeah, we connected through
singleballroomdancelovers.com

368
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,100
Why would he volunteer
that information?

369
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,300
Why would I hide it?

370
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,900
You didn't tell him
that anything he said

371
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,200
would be held against you.

372
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,100
So what line of work
are you in?

373
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,700
Oh, auto maintenance.

374
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,100
Changing oil and filters.

375
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,200
Great, my place overcharges.

376
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,000
Can't trust anything
you guys say.

377
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,400
Where're you located?

378
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,700
In 14 states.

379
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,500
I own Eastern Lube.

380
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,800
<i>Most CIPA complications and she's got a fever.</i>

381
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,900
LP? Urine?

382
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,600
Clean, normal.

383
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,400
Same with
the white blood cell count.

384
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,600
Cancer?

385
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,800
<i>Nothing on the scan.</i>

386
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,300
I think it's her nerves
messing with the temperature control.

387
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,600
Amyloid, sarcoid.

388
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,800
<i>There's a lot
of candidates.</i>

389
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,200
I want a biopsy.

390
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,300
Fine.

391
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,000
If that's what you need,
go get it.

392
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,800
He seems a lot nicer
than that one

393
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,700
from Wicca need a daddy figure
dot com.

394
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,700
One of these is warm,

395
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,400
the other is very hot.

396
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Start here,
move to the hot one.

397
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,800
<i>Just a few seconds.</i>

398
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,900
Then back.

399
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,400
We're gonna monitor
activity in your brain while you do it.

400
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,300
If you feel any response
to the heat,

401
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,700
<i>it could indicate
a vascular problem.</i>

402
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,000
How's my mom doing?

403
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,900
<i>(Chase)
She's okay.</i>

404
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,100
do you feel anything?

405
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,000
No.

406
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,000
What does okay mean?

407
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
She's still in surgery.

408
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,300
<i>They tell me
it's going okay.</i>

409
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,500
<i>You can
take your hand out.</i>

410
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
And you didn't
ask anything else?

411
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
Take your hand
out of the water.

412
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,400
What's going on
with my mother?

413
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,900
Hannah.

414
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,300
You just got
second degree burns.

415
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,600
I'll be fine.

416
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,600
What's going on
with my mother? Is she gonna die?

417
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,000
They said she's okay.

418
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,700
<i>Surgery this long
is typical when there are
internal injuries.</i>

419
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,000
Naloxone and kinase
proteins in.

420
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,700
And 27at's gonna
make me feel pain?

421
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,800
didn't feel anything
when you guys screwed this thing
into my head.

422
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
It'll repl'le missing chemicals
in your nerves.

423
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,200
Heighten sensitivity.

424
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
We'll be drilling
directly into your skull.

425
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,800
A response
could indicate sarcoma.

426
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,000
What does it feel like?

427
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,300
It...hurts.

428
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,800
Um...sorry.

429
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,700
Bone pain
is the worst there is.

430
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,400
<i>So you need to let know
as soon as you feel anything.</i>

431
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,800
She's ready.

432
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,300
<i>So what... I just sit here
while you guys drill a hole in me?</i>

433
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,900
You wanna talk?

434
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,200
Just you and your mom, huh?

435
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
You two
must be pretty close.

436
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,800
We were.
Until I got arrested.

437
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,900
The third time.

438
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,900
Drugs?
Fights.

439
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,800
You got an advantage.

440
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,100
Not really.
Never know when to stop.

441
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,800
You piss a lot of people off or are you just trying
to piss off your mom?

442
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,500
Those are pretty much
the only two choices you have.

443
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,700
Hannah?

444
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
<i>You want us to stop?</i>

445
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
<i>Stop the drill. Stop the drill.</i>

446
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,300
It's okay.

447
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,900
What'd you feel?

448
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,900
Where did you feel it?

449
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,000
Hannah, I need to know
how it hurt.

450
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,800
Hannah!

451
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,000
I am so tired of this.

452
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,200
Did you know
that the new nurse

453
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,400
from cardiology
is sleeping with

454
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,200
that weird lawyer
from the board?

455
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,000
The guy with 11 fingers?

456
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,600
He has 11 fingers?

457
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
How do you
not notice that?

458
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,200
The nurse
used to be a man.

459
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
She's not anymore?

460
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,100
But we can't
talk about that.

461
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,900
I thought we were.

462
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,000
We were supposed
to talk about that.

463
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
<i>I came here
to talk about that.</i>

464
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,300
But on the way up,
I ran into Cameron.

465
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,100
You've got
a CIPA patient.

466
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Mmm.

467
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,900
Tranny nurse
is more interesting.

468
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,300
Oh, it's way
more interesting.

469
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,600
But instead, I've gotta
be your damn conscience.

470
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,700
<i>I'm tired of being
your conscience.</i>

471
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,100
I don't enjoy being
your conscience.

472
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,000
<i>No one enjoys...
You're studying her.</i>

473
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,200
She's actually sick.

474
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Which you found out
after you took her on.

475
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,600
I was curious.

476
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,600
Since I'm not a cat,
that's not dangerous.

477
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,100
I don't think that metaphor
was designed to actually warn cats.

478
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,100
<i>You don't care
about her illness,</i>

479
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,400
<i> you care about CIPA.</i>

480
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,800
Which means your focus
is gonna be on getting your answers,

481
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,600
<i>not hers.</i>

482
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
Thank you.
Forewarned is forearmed.

483
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,800
What do you think
you're gonna figure out?

484
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,600
<i>You think her lack of pain
is somehow the answer to your pain.</i>

485
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,700
I think if you'd stop talking
to Cameron,

486
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,900
then right now,
we could be ranking nurses

487
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,600
in order of do-ability.

488
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,700
Need you.
What did the nerve
biopsy show?

489
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,300
Never did it.
Then do it.

490
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,700
<i>Can't.
Why?</i>

491
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,700
She's gonna jump off
the lobby balcony.

492
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,500
You think
I can catch her?

493
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,000
Get away from me!

494
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,400
I'm not gonna hurt you.

495
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Yes, you are.

496
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,000
You're just jealous
that I can do anything.

497
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,100
Hannah, you're having
a paranoid delusion.

498
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,200
I don't believe you.

499
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,100
Think she would

500
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
This is real.
You want me to be in pain.

501
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,900
You even said so.

502
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,900
If we wanted to hurt you,

503
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,100
<i>we'd let you jump.</i>

504
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,400
Just let me see my mother.

505
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,100
Fine, we'll take you
to her O.R. observation room.

506
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,300
I don't believe you!

507
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,200
Your mother is fine.

508
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,300
I just spoke
to her surgeon.

509
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,600
I don't believe you!

510
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,200
Hannah, what do you want
from us?

511
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
What do you want us
to do?

512
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,900
I can't feel my legs.

513
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,000
If you're trying to pull
the same stunt twice in ten minutes...

514
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,200
I'm not pretending.

515
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,800
???

516
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
WALK ???

517
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,500
Anything?

518
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,300
We're not
looking for pain.

519
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,500
Anything at all, pressure?

520
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,400
Nothing.

521
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,400
<i>You have
six br bones,</i>

522
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,700
a fever, a concussion,

523
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,600
erratic heart rhythms,

524
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,000
and a complete lack
of sensation below the waist.

525
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,300
I feel fine.

526
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,400
Is my mother
out of surgery yet?

527
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Not yet.

528
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
This is excellent.

529
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,800
The paranoia
seems to have dissipated.

530
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,900
But her vitals
keep getting worse.

531
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,300
She could be dead in hours.

532
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,900
But...if you're gonna die
a miserable, lingering death,

533
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,700
pain-free is the way
to do it.

534
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,600
You sure the fall
didn't cause the paralysis?

535
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,400
The paralysis
caused the fall.

536
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,200
<i>Spine's clean.</i>

537
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,800
No veritable fractures
or spinal cord compression.

538
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Even better.

539
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,100
The nuttiness and paralysis

540
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,500
<i>mean there's definitely
a neurological component.</i>

541
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,900
Could be a nerve disease.

542
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,500
<i>Which is why we need
to look at the nerve that you didn't biopsy.</i>

543
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,000
There are other tests...

544
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,900
HIV? Syphilis?

545
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,700
She's negative ???

546
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,000
<i>Vascular?
No.</i>

547
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,100
<i>ANA was negative.</i>

548
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,300
Cerebral clot?
No, MRI was...

549
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,300
Thyroid storm.

550
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,200
Makes sense, given her glucose reaction
was slow

551
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,300
<i>and potassium's down.</i>

552
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,600
Yeah.

553
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,900
I'll check
with an endocrinologist.

554
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200
Bennett's on call.

555
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Perfect.

556
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,200
No.

557
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,400
Need a consult.

558
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,500
I already okayed
your nerve biopsy.

559
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,100
Need an endocrinologist.

560
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,200
Bennett's on call.

561
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,100
Won't pick up.

562
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,600
His cell phone
must be broken.

563
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,800
Mine's working.

564
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,800
Had to give you the file.

565
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,200
I assume you're thinking
thyroid storm.

566
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,100
Have you done
a hormone panel?

567
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,400
Normal. TSH was on the low side.

568
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,000
Is that a cheery fire
I hear crackling nearby?

569
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
No.

570
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,000
What about CPK enzymes?

571
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Elevated.
275.

572
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,000
People light fires
for themselves.

573
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,100
But then
they don't deny it.

574
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,700
He's here.

575
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,200
CPK isn't high enough.

576
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,500
Potassium's
what you'd expect

577
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,300
because of
the bronchodilators.

578
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,700
Oh, my God!

579
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,900
You're not
wearing a bra.

580
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,300
It's not thyroid storm.

581
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,400
You just met him.

582
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,500
I like him.

583
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,000
And I like sex.

584
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,400
Do I need to stitch a letter
on my tops?

585
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,200
No.

586
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,000
But it might be worth
taking out an ad in the local papers.

587
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,400
Do you like me, House?

588
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,200
I was on the phone
with Bennett 15 minutes ago.

589
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,700
His cell phone's working.

590
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,100
You're M.O. is to avoid me
at all costs.

591
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,400
And suddenly,
you need my input on every move you make.

592
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,800
I can only assume
it's because I'm on a date.

593
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,900
When we met,
I noticed--

594
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,400
You noticed he was a Shriner
because the way he parted his hair.

595
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,600
You noticed he was
a mama's boy

596
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,100
because of the way
he blinked his left eye.

597
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,500
I'm not interested.
I'm not impressed.

598
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,900
There are only two reasons

599
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,800
anyone would want
to screw with me tonight.

600
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,100
Either they're an altruistic,

601
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,300
decent person who is worried
about my well being...

602
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,900
Or they want me FOR THEMSELVES

603
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,000
You left out
the third option.

604
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,000
Evil bastard who just wants
to mess with other people's happiness.

605
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,200
Good night, House.

606
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,200
We won't be bothered again.

607
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,300
It's late.

608
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,100
<i>I should go.
HMWhy?</i>

609
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,300
I part my hair on hae left
and I'm a Shriner.

610
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,200
You heard the conversation.

611
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm not interested in him.

612
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
I don't blame you.

613
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,700
I only said those things so that
he wouldn't come back.

614
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,900
I don't really
care about my job.

615
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
I do it well,
I provide a service.

616
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,700
But my goal was always
to make enough money

617
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,500
to do the things
I really like.

618
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,400
Music, travel...

619
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,100
I like those things too.

620
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,800
You like them, but they're not
really important to you.

621
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,400
I don't know
whether it's House,

622
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,200
your job, or if you just
thrive on conflict, but...

623
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,700
you should hear yourself
when you're talking to him.

624
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,700
Nothing else in the world
is going on.

625
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,000
You're focused,
confident, compelling.

626
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
Don't take this
the wrong way,

627
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,900
but I'd like
to go out with that woman.

628
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,600
I can get her
on the phone.

629
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,500
Where did you go?

630
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
She's getting worse.

631
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,000
???

632
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,400
Get me spinal nerve.

633
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,900
There are still
r tests.

634
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,200
She just said
the girl was getting worse.

635
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,500
You ???

636
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,900
We'll be risking infection,

637
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,300
maybe make
the paralysis worse.

638
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,500
It is worse.

639
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,700
We're making it worse
than worse.

640
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,600
Do the biopsy.

641
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,400
We could paralyze her
and get no useful information.

642
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,500
Do the biopsy.

643
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,800
If you're thinking
peripheral neuropathy,

644
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
we should a take a nerve
a little further away from the spine.

645
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,300
A little further
from the truth.

646
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,600
We're talking paralysis.

647
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,500
Good chance
the spine is relevant.

648
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
And if this thing
is progressive,

649
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,900
it'll kill her in hours.

650
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,400
Give me back my papers.

651
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,100
Is he asking
for a spinal nerve?

652
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,300
How did you know?

653
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,500
Give us a venute.

654
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,900
Did you know they recently
found a protein

655
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,800
that speeds up
nerve growth?

656
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,300
<i>Fascinating stuff.</i>

657
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,800
<i>If you put that protein
with the insulationfrom a spinal nee,</i>

658
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,700
you could grow your own
little garden.

659
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
If that spinal nerve...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

660
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,900
If it happened to come
from a person with CIPA,

661
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,600
I could grow
pain-free nerves

662
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,900
and graft them
into my own leg.

663
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,300
What an evil plan.

664
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,700
You'd have to be
on immunosuppressors for life.

665
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,800
Risking infection,
shorter life span...

666
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,700
Shorter.
But normal.

667
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,200
Usually jealousy
expresses itself

668
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,800
by trying to destroy
what someone has.

669
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,400
You're more ambitious.

670
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,600
You actually wanna
change medical fact to get this thing...

671
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,800
Medical fact
changes all the time.

672
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,300
You're risking
your patient's life.

673
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,100
That's how
medical fact changes.

674
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
A doctor risks--

675
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,800
To serve
their patient's health.

676
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Not their own.

677
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,900
This is medically justified.

678
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,000
Are you sure?

679
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,100
<i>Are you sure...</i>

680
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,800
that you're the right one
to be making this call?

681
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,800
Biopsy whatever nerve
you figure

682
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,400
you can safely get at.

683
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,100
GOd, Wilson's annoying.

684
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,000
(Cameron)
Past 3:00 AM
on Valentine's Day night.

685
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,700
I assume you
had a date with Wendy.

686
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
She'll survive.
She knows the deal.

687
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,800
You're lucky.

688
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,200
I know.

689
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,400
Someday, when thers time,

690
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I would like
to actually have a social life.

691
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Someday?

692
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,700
<i>Come on.If there's one thing
a good-looking woman</i>

693
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,800
can have when she wants,
it's a social life.

694
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,200
You mean a sex life.

695
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,900
There's nothing wrong
with a little companionship

696
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,100
'til the real thing
comes along.

697
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,300
I had the real thing.

698
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,000
Forgive me
if I don't want to settle.

699
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,600
Right.

700
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,700
What does that mean?

701
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,000
Nothing.

702
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,100
You think I didn't
have the real thing?

703
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,700
I have no idea
what you had.

704
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,200
And yet you're judging it.

705
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,700
It's late, I'm cranky.

706
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,300
<i>Sorry.</i>

707
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,700
You think
I didn't have the real thing.

708
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,100
How could you even know?

709
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,000
You married a dying man.

710
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,900
<i>You thought...</i>

711
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,400
six months, a year,
it'll be tough.

712
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,900
But then I'll recover
and I'll have the rest of my life.

713
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,500
<i>It's like willy-nilly
getting the flu</i>

714
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,000
or joining the Peace Corps.

715
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Short term.

716
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,900
Wow, you nailed it.

717
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,800
It's basically
like a wasted weekend.

718
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,100
The sacrifices you made
were huge.

719
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,800
<i>But they were at the height
of your love for him.</i>

720
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,800
A commitment
is only commitment

721
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,700
because it has
no expiration date.

722
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,500
<i>You stand next to someone</i>

723
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,300
and watch them floss
for 30 years,

724
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,600
like my parents have,

725
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,800
then ask for sacrifices.

726
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,500
That's how
you know the real thing.

727
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,200
Cameron...

728
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,800
I wasn't criticizing you.

729
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,700
People who avoid commitment
are people who know

730
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,300
what a big thing it is.

731
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,900
This isn't right.

732
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,200
CIPA can't cause
this much degenetion.

733
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,100
<i>(Chase)
A few nerve fibers
we teased out ofthe center</i>

734
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,500
have some insulation left.

735
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,100
But the insulation
around the bundles

736
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,100
has been stripped bare.

737
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
Means the damage must be
coming from the outside in.

738
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,600
Which means
it's secondary demyelination.

739
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,100
Which means the source
is somewhere else.

740
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,000
Which tells us
it's not a nerve disease,

741
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,700
it's something systemic that's affecting the nerves.

742
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,600
Which means
that we need to--

743
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,100
Where are you going?

744
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,600
Kid's mom is finally
out of surgery.

745
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,900
I'll be right back.

746
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So what?

747
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,500
Hannah should see her.

748
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,000
Yes, immediately after
we're done chatting

749
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,700
about saving her life.

750
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,900
Most likely
causes are metabolic.

751
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
They found brain swelling.

752
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,200
They're prepping her mother
for another surgery.

753
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,000
Again, so what?

754
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Get a nurse
to take the kid.

755
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,800
There are more than 60
different metabolic conditions

756
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,200
that could account
for what she's got.

757
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,500
There's only
three of you guys.

758
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,600
She's scared.

759
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,900
She should be.

760
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,800
She'll die if we don't
diagnose her.

761
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,200
So diagnose her.

762
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,400
Mom.

763
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,600
How bad is it?

764
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,700
Are u OK?

765
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,200
I'm okay, Mom.

766
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,300
I'll get better.
I always get better.

767
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,000
Are you checking yourself?
Your temperature?

768
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,800
Mom, could you
just let it go?

769
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,700
You shouldn't be worrying.

770
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,500
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

771
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,600
<i>I should have
seen that car coming.</i>

772
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,700
No.

773
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I did this to myself.
I screwed up.

774
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
You were right

775
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,100
You were right and I was wrong.

776
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
No.

777
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,800
No.

778
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,700
I...I shouldn't have
gone out on the ice.

779
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,200
<i>I shouldn't have
fallen down.</i>

780
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,400
And I shouldn't have
made you rush me

781
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,900
to an ER for the tenth time
this year.

782
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,800
Mom?

783
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,200
Mom?
You okay?

784
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,000
<i>We gonna have to take her
back to surgery.</i>

785
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,800
Hannah, your BP
is way up.

786
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,400
We need to get you
some rest.

787
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,500
My hand's wet.

788
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
You're crying.

789
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,900
I can't cry.

790
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,800
My head is killing me.

791
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,000
So what does the pain
tell us?

792
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,100
No tingling, no itching,
so we can rule out--

793
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,000
It tells us nothing.

794
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,900
It wasn't physical pain,
it was emotional.

795
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,100
Exactly.

796
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,500
What were they doing
when she got the headache?

797
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,600
Saying good-bye.

798
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,900
You said
they were arguing.

799
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
They weren't really arguing.

800
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,200
<i>She was just frustrated.</i>

801
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,700
What were they arguing about?

802
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,000
Whose fault it was.

803
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,700
Peripheral neuropathy,
fever,

804
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,500
and intermittent paranoia.

805
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,100
<i>Lots of metabolic conditions can explain those things.</i>

806
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,300
But what if we add guilt?

807
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,700
Guilt as a symptom?

808
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,200
Alzheimer's can
cause euphoria,

809
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
pain causes depression,

810
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,700
and B12 deficiency
causes guilt.

811
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,500
Along with
all that other stuff.

812
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,600
If she felt guilty,

813
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
she wouldn't be making
her mother's life miserable.

814
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,800
<i>She wouldn't be
getting in fights,</i>

815
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,700
<i>getting arrested...</i>

816
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,800
<i>Maybe she's fighting
because she feels guilty.</i>

817
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,400
<i>She's showing her mom
she can take stupid risks and still be safe.</i>

818
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,600
<i>Means mom can let go.</i>

819
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,900
<i>(Foreman)
Which is rational.</i>

820
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,000
If guilt is a symptom,

821
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
it's caused by the illness,

822
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,100
<i>not by a thought process.</i>

823
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,400
<i>And it would
have to be new.</i>

824
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,900
Couple years ago,
she was a model student.

825
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,000
<i>This is pointless.If the headache
was caused by guilt,</i>

826
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,400
<i>she has a B-12 deficiency.</i>

827
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,600
If it's just because
she was sad,

828
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,900
<i>it's meaningless. How the hell
do we test for that?</i>

829
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,800
<i>(House)
We don't.</i>

830
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,400
We give her
a shot of B12.

831
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,500
When she gets better,
I was right.

832
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,300
We already did.

833
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,100
ER gave her B12
when she was admitted.

834
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Part of a multi-vitamin
supplement.

835
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,100
Apparently,
she's just sad.

836
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,000
Why are you still here?

837
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Trying to get
a couple patients into a drug trial.

838
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,900
Paperwork's due tomorrow.

839
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,200
Why are you here?

840
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,300
Still haven't
figured out why...

841
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,900
No, I meant here.

842
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,900
In my office.

843
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,300
Just dumped
a cool B12 theory.

844
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,200
Moved on to leukemia.

845
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,200
Very pedestrian.

846
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,700
I'm not happy.

847
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
Her white blood cell count
was low.

848
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,300
But the one she's got...

849
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
A whole lot of eosinophils.

850
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,300
The immunoglobin E level's
borderline.

851
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,700
If you wanna be
100% sure,

852
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,800
check the bone marrow.

853
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,900
Team's doing
a biopsy right now.

854
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,100
So it turns out...

855
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,100
the weird lawyer...

856
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,100
knew that she used
to be a man.

857
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,400
And he's cool with that?

858
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,600
Turns out that
his previous girlfriend

859
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,100
also used to be a man.

860
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,800
Ho-ho!

861
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,700
Yeah.

862
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,900
<i>Is it possible
for you to just watch me eat?</i>

863
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,100
Or do you get
some primeval thrill

864
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,900
<i>out of beating
the other hunters to the food?</i>

865
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,700
See ya later.

866
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,700
You still haven't figured out
that I don't need sedation?

867
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,200
It's so you don't move
during the procedure.

868
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,600
Is that nitrous?

869
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,500
You trying to kill her?

870
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,900
You gave her nitrous
during the EEG.

871
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,600
That's what made this thing
rear its ugly head.

872
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,700
What thing?

873
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,000
B12 deficiency.

874
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,400
Are you having deja vu?
We've had this conversation.

875
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,500
She was given B12.
She didn't get better.

876
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,100
Because someone else
ate it.

877
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,000
<i>Get an abdominal MRI.</i>

878
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,800
What?

879
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,800
What are you doing?

880
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Don't touch me!

881
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,500
See, there she goes.

882
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,500
Another paranoid delusion.

883
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,000
<i>Come on. At the rate
she's going downhill,</i>

884
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,900
forget the MRI,
we need an O.R.

885
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,700
Leave me alone!

886
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,000
Occupied!

887
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,400
Her hernia can wait.

888
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,100
Help!
They're trying to kill me!

889
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,400
Okay, you can either believe
that we really are trying to kill her...

890
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,300
<i>Or you can assume
that she's suffering from a medical condition.</i>

891
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,000
<i>Seeing as this is a hospitaland we're all
dressed like doctors,</i>

892
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,900
and there are easier ways
to kill somebody...

893
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,100
Bev, help them.

894
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,600
Gonna need iodine,
scalpels number 10 and 15,

895
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,900
forceps,
and a largish salad bowl.

896
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,000
Okay, hold her down.

897
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,000
Come on, weenies,
she's in a cast.

898
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,900
Swab.

899
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,000
15.

900
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,000
You're not gonna
anesthetize her?

901
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,100
Relax, it's just
a magic trick.

902
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,100
She's faking it.

903
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,200
We're not falling for it
this time.

904
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,800
Okay, keep that retracted.

905
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,700
Forceps.

906
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,100
Lake fishing
can be fun.

907
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,800
It can bring the generations
together.

908
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,200
<i>But if you don't
cook that trout or perch well,</i>

909
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,600
you'll be giving
room and board to this fella.

910
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,900
And by free board, I mean
all the B12 you can take in.

911
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,700
I could have
one of ???

912
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,900
Not likely.

913
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,600
<i>You'd be in a lot of pain.</i>

914
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,600
It's gotta be
25 feet long.

915
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,500
Dammit.

916
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,700
World record's over 60.

917
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,300
Hannah. Wake up.

918
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,200
Somebody here to see you.

919
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,700
<i>She's got limited motion
on her left side.</i>

920
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,500
You might have to take care
of her for a while.

921
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,400
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

922
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,200
You don't feel it,

923
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,100
but you're about
to rip your stitches out.

924
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
Take care of yourself.

925
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,700
Then you can take care
of her.

926
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,200
You haven't gone home.

927
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,800
Sorry I screwed up
Valentine's Day.

928
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,600
<i>I'm dating a doctor.</i>

929
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,300
I'd be an idiot
to expect anything else.

930
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,200
I did get you a gift.

931
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
MGH.

932
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,700
Best teaching hospital
in Boston.

933
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,200
You wanna be
a nurse practitioner,

934
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,700
that's as good as it gets.

935
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,600
I made a few calls.

936
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,600
You're in ???

937
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,100
This is why you've been
helping me get

938
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,300
my surgical hours
for accreditation?

939
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,600
I thought you wanted...
Stupid.

940
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,600
You've got ten feet
of personal space around you.

941
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,400
<i>I step forward,
you step back.</i>

942
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,900
I've shared
a lot of things with you.

943
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,100
Which is why
you're breaking up with me.

944
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,300
You can't stand
to be close.

945
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,300
Wendy.

946
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,100
You think I'll stay with you
because you're angry with me?

947
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm upset.

948
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,700
Because I care.

949
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,500
Only you'd expect an argument
to be rational.

950
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,100
You and that
ass boss of yours.

951
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,300
You could ask her
for the spinal nerve.

952
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,100
She's got
no reason to give it.

953
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,400
She owes you.

954
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,300
The hospital
will send her a bill.

955
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm just saying.

956
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,000
If you wanna do it, do it
while her B12 is still low.

957
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,400
Guilt can be your friend.

958
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Breakfast?

959
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,600
Yeah.

960
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,400
Happy Valentine's Day.

961
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,600
A holiday that only
applies to people who are already paired up.

962
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,200
For everyone else,
it's Wednesday.

963
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,700
Thank you for that
dash of cold water.

964
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,200
Don't get me wrong,

965
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,500
I still think
true love's out there,

966
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,900
it's just very far away.

967
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,400
Possibly in another galaxy.

968
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,300
We may need to develop
faster than light travel

969
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,800
before we can make contact.

970
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,300
So I'm thinking
we should have sex.

971
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,700
That makes sense.

972
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,200
Despite the wisdom
of pop songs,

973
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,600
there's no point
in putting our lives on hold

974
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,100
'til love comes along.

975
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,100
We're both healthy
and busy people.

976
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,900
We work together,
so it's convenient.

977
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,700
Like microwave pizza?

978
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,900
And of all the people
I work with,

979
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,100
you're the one
I'm least likely to fall in love with.

980
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,700
Like microwave pizza.

981
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,100
The point here
is to make things simpler,

982
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,400
not more complicated.

983
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,600
Someday, there'll be time
to get serious about someone.

984
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,100
Meanwhile, we already
had sex once

985
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,200
and didn't get weird
about it.

986
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,500
I get it.
I get it.

987
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,000
So what if I'm offended
by your judgment?

988
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,800
Then you're not the man
I'm looking for.

989
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
