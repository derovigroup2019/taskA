1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,240
Mark.Mark!

2
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,690
Mark, would you pleaseask your father if he wants a burger?

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,700
I know, you're defendingthe free world.Please ask your dadif he wants a burger.

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,770
Dad.

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,640
dad.

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,010
Mom wants to knowif you want a burger.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,720
Mom, I don't knowwhat he wants.

8
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,720
You want a burger?

9
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,530
the guy drove his wheelchairinto a pool.House would love that.

10
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,210
He'll be bored.It's a great visual,but it's diagnostically boring.

11
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,150
What about post-hair-transplantaphasia guy?

12
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,990
Infection throwing clots.House'll shoot it downand call you an idiot.

13
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,570
Oh, well,I wouldn't want that.

14
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,170
What about yoga girl?

15
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,170
It has a good hook.

16
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,320
Should we lead with it?

17
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,860
His first day backhe might want to flex his sarcasm muscle.

18
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,180
Maybe we open with one of the weaker pitches.

19
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,690
You ran here?

20
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,610
It's just eight miles.

21
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,720
Why did you--

22
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,480
why does a dog lick its workplace-acceptable euphemismfor testicles?

23
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,880
Because he can.

24
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,250
What do you gotfor me, boss?

25
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,840
I thought you said you neededeight weeks of rehab.You should'vebeen back here--

26
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,200
if I'd come back sooner, then I'd only be ableto run six miles.I never would've made it in.

27
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,350
What do you got for me?

28
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,070
You're completelypain-free?

29
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,670
The ketamine treatmentcan wear off.

30
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,630
It's been two months.It's not wearing off.

31
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,540
What do you gotfor me?

32
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,930
-It can takeas long as--
-why are we havingthis discussion?

33
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,720
Nna hear me ank you again?Thank you, dr.Cuddy--

34
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,170
not justfor removing the bullet,

35
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,360
but thank you for putting me in a ketamine-induced coma and changing my life.

36
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,840
Happy?I am.

37
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,860
Middle-aged manhad a hair transplant about two months ago--

38
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,090
infection throwing clots.You're an idiot.

39
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,890
Except you're not an idiot.

40
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,890
And she's holding a filefor a 26-year-old female.

41
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,690
What do you really gotfor me?

42
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,670
Girl was doingan inverted yoga pose.Neck snapped.Paralyzed from the neck down.

43
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,520
Except the x-rays showno evidence of spinal injury.

44
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,570
And she's cute.

45
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,410
Oh, well played, sir.

46
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,650
What about stephen hawkingtrying to do the 500 butterfly?

47
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,830
Forget it.Brain cancer, brain surgery.

48
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,190
There's nothing left diagnose.I would takethe other one.

49
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,980
I'll take 'em both.

50
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,360
You don't thinkhe had brain cancer?

51
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,630
Course he had brain cancer.Even oncologists don't screw upfor eight years.

52
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,580
So if there's nodiagnostic issue, why are you takingthe case?

53
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,230
Treatment can be interesting.

54
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,870
-Not to you.
-I've changed.

55
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,980
-No, you haven'T.
-No, I haven'T.

56
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,330
So why are you takingthe case?

57
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,180
Guy tried to kill himselF.

58
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,600
The guy had cancer.He's a lump.

59
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,530
He hasn't been ableto touch his wife, speak to his kids.

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,610
He's been in that chairfor eight years.

61
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,520
His muscles have atrophied.Maybe I can help himwith the pain.

62
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,340
Isn't that enough of a reasonto want to help?

63
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Not for you.

64
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,980
-I've changed.\n-No, you haven'T.

65
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,450
Then why am I takingthis case?

66
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,090
Let's startwith the cute paraplegic.

67
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,030
Welcome back.

68
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,600
You look--

69
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,640
healthy.

70
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,160
Quad with no broken neck.Struck me as odd.

71
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,280
Uh, you could takea whole two minutes to ease into being back.

72
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,010
Wouldn't taken a whole monthto ease back.

73
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,640
But eight weeks isthe maximum rehab time for a gunshot woundto the stomach and neck.

74
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,830
So go.

75
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,350
We heard they neverfound the guy.There's no new leads?

76
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,500
What, you thinkhe might've shot this patient, too?That would explain her symptoms.

77
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,540
Could be M.S.

78
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,080
See?It's not so difficult.

79
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,640
It's not M.S.

80
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,600
She had no symptoms beforeshe climbed onto her head.

81
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,950
Unless she's been upside-downfor the last ten years, M.S.Ain't it.

82
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,900
Could be transverse myelitis,swelling in the disks choking off nerve function.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,300
mri was negative for that.

84
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,590
(?±?»??)

85
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,370
When did this turn into"what did you do over your summer vacation?

86
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,110
"it's a little weird to discuss the casewhile you're staring at your blood on the floor.

87
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,320
I asked cuddyto replace the carpet.

88
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,290
I like the carpet.

89
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,920
What did you doover the summer?

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,590
-I--
-redo the tests.

91
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,410
Let's see if the sourceof the problem is in the limbsor the spine.Do an emg.

92
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,130
Got a whole other quadto cover.

93
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,530
This guy's still got fluid in his lungs.

94
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,260
You don't think that'sfrom the pool he drank?

95
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,480
Get him an o-2 mask.His leg muscleshave atrophied.

96
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,650
Tendons have shortened from disuse, causing intense pain.

97
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,810
Tendon surgery will make himmore comfortable.

98
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,560
comfortable?

99
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,120
Scoot.

100
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,740
anks for being here.

101
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,330
not a problem.

102
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,190
My dad wouldn't kill himself.

103
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,150
You haven't spoken to himin over six years.

104
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,030
I know my dad.

105
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,970
Mark, the doctor'sjust trying to--

106
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,480
he wouldn't kill himself.

107
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,290
Fine.I'm wrong.

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,100
You obviously havea better understanding of this man who drooin front of your tv set 24 hours a day.

109
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,630
Dr.House.

110
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,670
he must have been confused.

111
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,120
All right?It must have beenan accident.

112
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,060
Hope it wasa suicide attempt.

113
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,400
If he was trying to kill himself, then he knows how miserable his life is.

114
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,900
It means there's stillsomething there to kill.

115
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,440
It means your dad'sstill there.

116
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,640
Sorry.Need you.

117
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,090
Thank you.

118
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,500
We were doing the emg,but we never got past the insertionof the conduction pin.

119
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,360
Did she just say"thank you"?

120
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,940
I loaned her some money.What went wrong?

121
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,320
Nothing went wrong.

122
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,330
If nothing went wrong,then something went right.

123
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,110
You're not gonna tell mewhy she thanked you?

124
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,530
You're not gonna tell mewhat went right?

125
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,370
You did somethingfor which she is grateful, and you're...

126
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,310
embarrassed?

127
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,220
For you.

128
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,950
She saw you coming up, thought you werea 14-year-old boy.I set her straight.

129
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,500
I am not telling youwhat went wrong.Or right.

130
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,130
Until you tell mewhy she said thank you.

131
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,420
Oh, you've got me.

132
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,550
You know I need to know.I am so gonna fold.

133
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,100
Except you're forgettingthere's one thing I can do now.

134
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,350
It's either thator a reflex response or--

135
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,710
what happened?

136
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,810
Okay.

137
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,060
This is dr.House.

138
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,640
-House, this is caren.
-Pleasure's all mine.What happened?

139
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,460
When we insertedthe conduction pin,she flinched.

140
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,600
She flinched!Did you hear?

141
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,800
Does that mean I'm getting better?

142
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,130
How big is a flinch?

143
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,470
Bigger than a twitch?Smaller than a spasm?

144
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,040
You smoke?

145
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,600
Socially.Not a lot.

146
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,210
You do yogaand you smoke?

147
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,640
I know.It's hypocritical.

148
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,380
Not at all.The world sees your legs.

149
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,470
No one's checking out your lungs.

150
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,620
-How would smoking--
-it wouldn'T.

151
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,930
I just needed a lighter.

152
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,040
House!

153
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,140
Oh, my god!

154
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,770
The case was lookingso promising.

155
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,950
Hey, I'm not faking.

156
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,310
You moved.Therefore, you can move.

157
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,310
Get this lunaticout of here before she bores again.

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
I'm not faking!

159
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,410
I heard youwere watching surgery with a patient's family.

160
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,660
Talking to a patient's family.

161
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,230
It's because of yourhallucination, isn't it?After you were shot.

162
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,760
You chose life.You decidedyou wanted meaning.

163
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,300
So you took a casewith no mystery.

164
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,590
Something any doctor could do.

165
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,900
A case with no upside except the satisfaction of helpinganother human being.

166
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,080
She thanked me.

167
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,450
And...you felt nothing.

168
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,450
I wasn't even surewhat I was supposed to feel.

169
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,850
It's like your leg.It's atrophied.

170
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,380
Keep working it.The feeling will come.

171
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,420
Sorry.

172
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,800
Need you.Again.

173
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,020
I told youto get rid of her.

174
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,720
It's a good thing we didn'T.Tightness in her chest.

175
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,570
She can't breathe.It could bea pleural effusion.

176
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,410
Right.

177
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,360
Either thator she's holding her breath like a four-year-old.

178
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,460
RelaX.

179
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,300
I'm not gonnaburn you again.

180
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,530
I'm going to stab you!

181
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,840
Look, either you're faking or you've gota pleural effusion.

182
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,430
That's a buildup of fluidaround the lungs,which is very serious,

183
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,930
and I'd have no choice but to stab you in the backwith this needle and suck all the fluidout of you.

184
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,930
-So.
-we should give her a local.

185
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,870
That would defeat the pointof me being nasty.

186
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,570
Ready?

187
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,740
-Down.
-She can't breathe if she's down.

188
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,610
-Down.
-She can't--

189
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,480
down, down, down!Come on!

190
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,010
That's nota pleural effusion.

191
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,320
The problem's in her heart.

192
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,280
Can't fake that.

193
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,190
I've had to relievethe pressure three times In the last two hours.

194
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,510
So either we figure out what's causing blood to build uparound her heart,

195
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,080
or I follow her aroundwith a needle for the rest of her life.

196
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,200
Echo was clean.No structural abnormalities.

197
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,520
Could be aninfectious process, tb.

198
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,490
Or vasculitis would alsoplain the effusion.

199
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,260
but not the paralysis.

200
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,580
Let's assumethat she wasn't faking it.

201
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,490
she moved.Therefore, she could move.

202
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,740
She wasn't paralyzed.

203
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,950
Doesn't mean she was faking.Could have been a delusion.

204
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,520
Either she was faking

205
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,260
and coincidentallygot a real cardiac problem at the exact same time, or it's a delusion.

206
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,480
And the fake paralysisis a real neurological symptom.

207
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,620
You thinking vascular tumorin her spine?

208
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,740
Her platelets are normal.

209
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,800
And she's been scannedup and down.It was all clean.

210
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,240
So open her up and find it.

211
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,840
so what do you want us to do?

212
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,680
Start at her neck and just keep cuttingdown her spine until we stumble on something?

213
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,210
That should work.

214
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,300
His heart rate'sa little high.

215
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,310
Should I be worried?

216
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,990
Probably just meanshe's still in discomfort from the surgery.

217
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm gonna up his morphinea little.

218
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,800
You've been so nice to us.

219
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,610
That's the job.

220
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,080
No, I mean,all the other doctors,

221
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,200
all they did was obsess on the cancer, the treatment, the damage.

222
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,680
Just trying to fix him.

223
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,480
You're the first doctor that's ever given a damnabout the quality of his life.

224
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,160
His heart rate'scome down.

225
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,770
Morphine worked.I was right.

226
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,960
What a touching moment.

227
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,980
That's whywe become doctors.

228
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,660
One of those rare momentswhen our hearts are warmed--

229
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,980
would you liketo get a drink?

230
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,920
Are you serious, or are you just tryingto change the subject?

231
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,140
No, I'm serious.

232
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,920
I drink.You drink.

233
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,060
We could do itat the same time.

234
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,310
At the same table.

235
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,590
Do you eat?

236
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,010
We could do that, too.

237
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,800
I mean, if the answer is no, that's cool, but--

238
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,290
no, it's just--

239
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,160
you're just comingoff the surgery, and you're not yourself yet.

240
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,970
And I work for you,and even though last year'S...

241
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,330
You're smiling.I'm saying no,and you're smiling.

242
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, don't take itpersonally.

243
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,150
It's just 'causeyou're full of crap.

244
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,220
You have no interestin going out with me.

245
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,400
Maybe you did...

246
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,400
when I couldn't walk.

247
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,430
When I was a sick puppy that you could nurtureback to health.

248
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,930
Now that I'm healthy,there's nothing in it for you.

249
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,590
You are not healY.

250
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,270
Cuddy wants to see you.

251
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:20,560
You've been back at work24 hours, and you're alreadyplaying hide-and-seek in a woman's spine.

252
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,390
Who won the pool?

253
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,650
There's no tumor.

254
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,170
Her platelets are normal.

255
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,040
-The scans didn't--
-what's the worstthat can happen?

256
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,780
I paralyze her.

257
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,300
She wouldn't even notice.

258
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,900
Her lawyers might.

259
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,970
You're not doing the surgery.And lower the morphineon your other patient.

260
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,870
Fine, I'll lower it.If you'll let me dothe surgery.

261
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,180
What?

262
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,110
You want to trade?

263
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,170
We're not swappin'a couple of goats for your helpputtin' up a barn.

264
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,740
You want something.I want something.

265
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,280
We compromise.It's the grownup wayto resolve our differences.

266
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,670
There alreadyis a mechanism for that.

267
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,880
It's called the employer-employee relationship.

268
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,930
I get what I want,and you don'T.

269
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,590
You tried to swap?

270
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,420
Ran a few more tests.

271
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,030
Came back negative.Surgery's on.

272
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,660
You really don'tgive a crap, do you?

273
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,870
Does that make me evil?

274
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,500
Yeah.

275
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,480
The girl's lifeis at stake.All we're talking aboutwith the guy is--

276
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,510
all we're talking aboutis the reason you took the case.To help someone.

277
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,510
-Too bad for them.
-Too bad for you.

278
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,000
The reason we crave meaning is becauseit makes us happy.

279
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,830
The first levelof happiness is--

280
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,090
I'm not going away.

281
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,790
the fifth level of happiness involves creation.

282
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,930
Changing lives.

283
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,630
the sixth level is heroin.The seventh level is you going away.

284
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,290
You're saving lives.Which is tantamountto creating lives.

285
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,380
But all you're takingaway from this is the game.

286
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,730
You don't have to listen to them thanking you.

287
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,650
You don't have to change the cases you take or even how you handle them.

288
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,000
You just have to know that you made a difference.

289
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,710
House, you're not--

290
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,120
I'm not an idiot.

291
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,280
house, leave her alone.

292
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,160
close her up.

293
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:28,980
Wanna know why?

294
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,790
The room's no longer sterile.

295
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,770
True, but that's notthe most interesting reason.

296
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,190
That is not a sexy big toe.

297
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,820
You would neverput that in your mouth.

298
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,140
-What the hellhas that got to do with--
-told youit was interesting.

299
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,710
It gets even better.

300
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,390
Scurvy?

301
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,990
Yeah.Drink.

302
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,600
Like what sailors getwhen they don't eat right?

303
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,620
Aye-aye.

304
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,230
Your arms and leg tissuesare choked with blood.

305
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,330
Makes it hard to move.Also damages your hairand toenails.

306
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,420
But I'm on this great diet.Lots of protein, lots of--

307
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,770
no vitamin C.

308
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,630
Now drink.

309
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,170
Well, thank you.

310
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,290
And thank dr.House.

311
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,200
Send him a note.

312
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,470
The nurse changedhis morphine.I thought you wereworried about the--

313
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,760
it's just post-opdiscomfort.He's ready to go home.

314
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,010
So he won't haveany pain?

315
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,720
Eventually.

316
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,420
Thank you.

317
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,850
Everything elsewill be the same.

318
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,270
Well, you took away his pain,and that--that changes a lot.

319
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,310
Why don't you put himin some sort of facility?

320
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,670
Someplace without a pool.

321
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,530
Yeah, I could dump him there.

322
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,740
Except...

323
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,770
he's my husband.

324
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,030
He's my son's father.

325
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,150
Right.

326
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,920
Kids need a dad.

327
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,800
Someone to play catch with,talk about girls.

328
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,320
Mark's learned that you don'thave to abandon someone--

329
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,760
get a dog.

330
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,970
I'm taking care of him for the same reasonyou helped us.

331
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,320
Some guy shot you,and you hallucinated?

332
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,250
I have a responsibility.

333
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,270
So he's just an anchor weighingyou and your family down.

334
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,940
Sapping your energy,wasting your life.That's the meaningyou take from this.

335
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,670
I want to take care of him.

336
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,420
You enjoy this.

337
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,460
I can't abandon him.

338
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,810
So you don't wantto take care of him.

339
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,940
Taking care of him doesn't fulfill you,make you happy.

340
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,580
But not taking care of himwould make you miserable.

341
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,420
Okay.

342
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,830
Here we go.

343
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,370
I don't need your help.I've done thisa million times.

344
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,930
Lay him back down.

345
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,560
Do that again.

346
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,170
Make that sound.

347
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,050
What was that?

348
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,600
That...

349
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,380
was talking.

350
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,030
you guysare lousy doctors.

351
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,920
You're in such a rush to make the patient feel better, you forgot to checkwhat was wrong.

352
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,650
Yoga girl walked out of heretwo hours ago.You fixed her.

353
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,350
Not her.The other guy.

354
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,040
He had brain canceR.They removed iteight years ago.

355
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,940
His condition's been the sameever since.

356
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,210
Until last night.He spoke.

357
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,090
What'd he say?

358
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,770
He...grunted?

359
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,340
You want us to dissect eight years of medical historywith grunting in the differential?

360
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,200
Sounds good.Call me when you're done.

361
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,440
You're fabricating a mysterybecause you're bored.

362
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,870
I am not bored.

363
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,620
Damn it.

364
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,310
You didn't tell the wifeit was only a grunt?

365
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,250
Of course not.

366
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,710
Because then she neverwould have consented to a bunch of dangerous tests.

367
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,710
I don't remember youbeing this bitchy.

368
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,080
The vicodin dulled it.In the sober light of day,I'm a buzz-kill.

369
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,460
You're giving false hope to a family that's been wrecked.

370
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,390
Don't torture them.

371
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,200
Let it go.Tell the wifeit was only a grunt.Tell her to go home.

372
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,730
I can't let her downlike that.

373
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,080
Pumped her upwith too much false hope.

374
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,520
Oh, I stuck that primo!

375
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,030
How rad am I?

376
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,220
2002, patient had dry eyes.

377
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,280
Dry eyes plus a grunt.

378
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,400
It all makes sense.

379
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,530
Could bea neurological issue.

380
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,390
I get hay fever,I put drops in my eyes.I don't goto a neurologist.

381
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,500
Dry eyes could indicatean autonomic dysfunction.

382
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,400
Goes on the board.

383
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,270
What about coughing?

384
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,220
Or boogers?Should we include boogers?

385
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,880
I'm happy we're doing this.

386
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,420
I'd much rather do this than lengthensome guy's tendon.

387
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,680
Patient's headachesincreased.

388
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,510
Doc scanned his head,found a tumor.

389
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,980
You like wasting your time?

390
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,980
-I'm learning.
-To do what?

391
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,620
Reconsider solved cases because you don't want to deal with the real world?

392
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,070
He's pushingwhere there's nothing.

393
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,330
Cameron, you arean excellent doctor.

394
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,950
You'll get lotsof tearful thank-yous from grateful patients.

395
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,970
Yeah, am I such a bitchfor wanting that?

396
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,720
Well, it's not a bad thing.But it's not why I'm here.

397
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,590
I took this fellowshipto learn from house.

398
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,340
He's teaching youto be a masochist.

399
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,390
Dry eyes goes on the board.

400
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,230
in eight years, the patient experienced 214 symptoms, many of them repeating.

401
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,760
Any patterns?

402
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,890
fever plus frequent urination could mean prostatitis.

403
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,860
Or a urinary tract infection.

404
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,880
-White count was normal.
-No infection.

405
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,460
if you add pain into the mix, fever,

406
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,460
frequent urination could indicate a kidney problem.

407
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,280
I like it.

408
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,290
No.Creatinine and bunwere both normal.

409
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,470
Not the kidney part.The pain part.

410
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,780
Abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal pancreatic cysts.

411
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,790
perfect.You've managed to pick the one symptom he never had.

412
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,150
Abdominal pain.

413
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,190
It's the first symptomon the board.Grunt.

414
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,580
Grunting isn't pathognomonic for abdominal pain.

415
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,290
No.

416
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,740
The traditionaldiagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm

417
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,670
and vibration of the larynx, leading to the audible sound.

418
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,150
"I have a painin my abdomen.

419
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,180
"richard's symptoms are culled from eight yearsof medical history.

420
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,930
They're not patterned.These are random, individual events over time.

421
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,190
Illnesses haveincubation periods.

422
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,960
Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.

423
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,330
his throat will collapse.

424
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,850
Muscle degenerationin his neck won't tolerate the scope.

425
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,990
It's an automatic trach.

426
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,890
You're talking about himlike he's an invalid.

427
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,150
We're insensitive.

428
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,710
Does he drool?Can he hold his neck straight?

429
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,330
Does he chokeon his food?

430
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,120
His neck's fine.His throat'snot gonna collapse.

431
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,170
Cameron, get consentfrom the wife.

432
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,470
Open.

433
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,840
I need you to swallow.

434
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,850
Sorry about that.

435
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,230
Here we go.

436
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,930
Passing through the loweresophageal sphincter,
into the antrum of the stomach.

437
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,900
There's the tail of the pancreas.

438
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,100
Looks clean.

439
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,330
Moving medially,the body and the headof
the pancreas look clean--

440
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,040
get it out.Get it out.

441
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,260
It's stuck.
I can't move it.

442
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,770
His throat's collapsed.

443
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,340
Vitals are all overthe place.
We're losing him.

444
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,450
I'm cutting.

445
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,330
We trached him,endoscopicallyremoved the probe,
and he's breathing again.

446
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,220
So,all in all,great idea.

447
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,430
Did you get a lookat the pancreas
before the world ended?

448
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,370
It was clean.

449
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,130
Which means,barring anything else,
meaning you,he can go home tomorrow.

450
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,400
This man nearly died.
How can you discharge him?

451
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,620
His throat collapsed becauseof what we predicted.

452
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,070
you stick something down someone's throat,
they gag.Spasm.

453
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,120
Which he did.
It took us a half an hourto get that thing out.

454
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,570
Except our patient's throatwas sedated.

455
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,530
Which means the brainshould have sent
a signal in not to do anything.

456
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,550
This could be cancer.

457
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,710
Or some bizarre neurodegeneration.
Even a new typeof vacular--

458
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,080
stop it.

459
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,530
You're enjoying this.

460
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,380
I find it interesting.

461
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,220
It's interestingonly if you're right.
If you're wrong,we're torturing this guy to amuse you.

462
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,700
Half hourto remove the probe?

463
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,440
House.

464
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,630
It's not a spasm.

465
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,840
His throat didn't collapse.
It locked down.

466
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,600
Brain is supposed to tell every muscle in
the body to relax and contract at the same time.

467
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,080
This muscle was onlycontracting,which means
a signal from thebrain was not getting through.

468
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,990
there are no lesions  his brain.
Nothing to interruptany orders.

469
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,460
All it takes is one wire down.

470
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,150
You have no evidenceof any wires down.

471
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,730
A few microtumorson the meninges,
suddenly you're chokingto death.

472
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,160
You wanna lookat the lining of his brain?

473
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,480
the amount of contrast material
you'd need to pump up there just to see--

474
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,280
he'll bleed into his brain.

475
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,090
- No,he won'T.
- Because that wouldn'tbe interesting.

476
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,680
You can get permissionthis time.

477
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,910
The brain is enclosedin a sack
called the meninges.

478
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,210
Does this meanthe cancer's back?

479
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,360
No,no,no,no.

480
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,610
House.

481
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,710
If we found cancer,

482
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,030
it wouldn't bethe original cancer.
It'd be new.

483
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,220
So what?More surgery?
More radiation?

484
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,690
Might not bethe worst thing.

485
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,690
If this isn'tjust ancient history,
maybe it's somethingwe can correct.

486
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,660
Might even get some brain function back.

487
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,960
He could get better?

488
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,620
No.

489
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,090
But understanding whatyou're
saying would be nice.

490
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,100
Maybe you can figure outways to communicate.

491
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,100
Thank god he spoketo you.

492
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,960
Mrs.McneiL.

493
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,730
The test to do this is very risky.

494
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,000
He could die.

495
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,390
He's already dead.

496
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,210
chase,  go slow

497
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,350
already injected into spinal canal

498
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,680
next stop is brain

499
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,280
contrast material entering into
the fourth ventricle.

500
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,500
No parietal bleeds.

501
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,300
Blood pressure's high.
But it's holding.

502
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,470
meninges are intact.
No bleeding.

503
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,250
Oh,god.

504
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,290
Foreman,get in here.

505
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,560
*******

506
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,940
you are lucky he didn't die

507
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,300
I'm lucky? he is the one who didn'y die

508
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,710
we told you he had haemorrhage

509
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,650
you told me he bleed into his brain
not out of his ear

510
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,240
gotta drop this

511
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,790
I'm missing something

512
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,870
we did a dangerous test
and something bad happened

513
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,820
that's all this is

514
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,980
give me tour of the brain Foreman

515
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,920
walk me through the scans
1998

516
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,070
what happened

517
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,600
*******

518
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,620
nothing

519
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,920
next
spec on the superior temporal region

520
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,850
It's regrowth, it's benign

521
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,690
*****

522
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,520
scar tissue from bioposy

523
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:10,790
House, every spec is not suspect
It's use of surgeon digging around his head

524
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,590
let him go

525
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,350
we do every blood test he's ever had

526
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,730
re-scan his head

527
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,400
no

528
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,420
he's in sick in suffering for 8 years
and I'm not gonna helping make it worse

529
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,880
I'm not gonna help you make interesting

530
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,020
That's okay.
Foreman's better at that stuffthan you are.

531
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,510
We need 5-millimeter cuts through
the occipitaland hypothalamic regions.

532
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,400
No.

533
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,310
How many millimeters?

534
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,450
I can help him.

535
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,140
This is it?
That's your argument?

536
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,950
Seems like a good one.

537
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,900
If I thought for a secondyou wanted
to help him,you'd have carte blanche.

538
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,070
You're doing thisbecause it's fun.

539
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,680
Does nobodyin this hospital have
anything betterto talk about than my motives?

540
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,300
My motives have nothing to dowith the case.

541
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,560
Your motives have everythingto
do with your judgment.

542
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,770
For the first time in years,
I've got no opiates in my body.

543
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,190
Now you question my judgment.

544
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:15,190
24 times a year you comestorming into my office,
spouting that you can help someone.

545
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,120
Only you never saythose words.

546
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,290
You say something like,

547
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,890
"his pancreas is gonna explodebecause
his brain is on fire."

548
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,630
You come here with medicine,
not with platitudes.

549
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,820
I didn't want to bore youwith the details.

550
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,320
There are no details.

551
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,960
You have a hunch.

552
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,470
House,you don't use hunches.

553
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,900
You always have reasons.

554
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,720
This hospital doesn't exist for your whims.
I'm sorry.

555
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,250
As of 7:00 A.M. Tomorrow morning,
I'm sending your patient home.

556
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,230
The answer is no.

557
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,890
Cuddy called 30 secondsafter you left
and said you'd tryan end around.

558
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,010
My leg hurt.

559
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,820
How bad?

560
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,860
Enough that I'mtelling you.

561
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,300
Did it go away?

562
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,040
Ached for a while.

563
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,590
First time I've felt anythingthere
since the surgery.

564
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,540
But it went away.

565
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,710
It was muscular.
There was some cramping.

566
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,980
What are you smiling about?

567
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,580
You're 40-somethingyears old. You've been
running god knows how many miles a day.

568
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,220
Fallen 100 tim off that skateboard,
and you're shocked to have some soreness?

569
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,790
Just give mea prescription.

570
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,150
For vicodin?

571
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:58,270
House,people getaching joints,cramps,
they put onan ice pack.They take some ibuprofen.

572
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,230
I know what the pangsof middle age feel like.

573
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,720
No,you don'T.

574
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,940
Because you've been stuffingvicodin every
five minutes since you turned middle-age.

575
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,530
The surgery didn't work.

576
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,080
Don't play me.

577
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,720
Oh,you thinkthis is a scam?

578
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,670
I think you want meto feel sorry for you and either
do the end around on cuddy or give you the drugs.

579
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,350
Either way,you get the highyou
think you need.

580
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,910
House,your surgery worked.
You're fine.

581
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,380
It's just gonna take timefor
it to feel good.

582
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:09,980
The circumventricular systemsenses cytokines
released in the early stagesof the immune response.

583
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,140
But cvos releases prostaglandinsthat
reset the hypothalamic set point upward,

584
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,750
unless it's countered by anti-pyretic therapy.

585
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,140
So yeah,his brainis on fire.

586
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,870
The suicide attempt was not a suicide attempt.

587
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,730
He drove that wheelchairinto the pool
because he couldn't regulatehis body temperature.

588
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,370
He had hypothalamicdysregulation.

589
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,540
And you discovered this...

590
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,950
when you stepped into the...

591
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,080
university pool?

592
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,630
Fountain.

593
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,950
- I can cure him.
- Cure him.

594
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:44,030
Even if the fountainproved anything,fixing
hypothalamicdysregulation isn't gonna regenerate brain.

595
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,450
No,but if the scar tissueon his hypothalamus

596
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,790
is restingagainst the pituitary,
the adrenals would shut down.

597
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,040
Addison's disease.

598
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,780
You didn't see anyscar tissue on his mri.
His ct scans--

599
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,320
- his brain is functional.
- His temperature's normal.

600
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,330
There is nothing wrong with his
hypothalamusor his pituitary.

601
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,100
I can make him walk.
I can make him talk.

602
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,270
This is a wild guess that came
to youbecause you were sweating.

603
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,130
Inject him with cortisol.

604
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,420
The guy'll have sexwith his wife again.
He'll hug his kid again.

605
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,070
Hopefully that'sthe combination he was using.

606
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,560
Be a shameif I cured a pedophile.

607
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,180
You're smiling.
That's a bad sign.

608
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,500
You're high.

609
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,670
I told you I haven't hadanything
in three months.

610
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,520
This is as highas you get.

611
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,310
A theory that ties your case up
in a neat little bow.

612
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,330
But you don't have a lickof
substantiating proof.

613
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,520
Your decisiondoesn't make any sense.

614
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,420
There is no risk to a cortisol injection.
If I'm wrong,big deal.

615
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,200
He goes home a vegetable,like he already is.
But if I'm right--

616
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,380
this is not about downsidesor
risk management.

617
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,220
It is a big deal for youto
understand the word no.

618
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,560
I'm sorry,house.

619
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,450
He's on his wayout of here.

620
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:27,450
Figured you'd beon your scooter racing down the
halls to stab the patient in the neckwith cortisol.

621
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,740
She was right to say no.

622
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,820
I had no objective reason to
thinkthat I was right.

623
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,790
Just needed the puzzle.

624
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,820
Hold on a sec.

625
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,040
Is everything all right?

626
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,880
Yeah,it's just somethingI forgot.

627
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,780
What's that?

628
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,920
This is cortisol.

629
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,280
And it's to fight infection.

630
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,050
Wanna hold onto that?

631
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,460
Put a bandage on it.

632
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,790
Let's see.
Is he okay?

633
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,780
Yes.

634
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,360
Can we go now?

635
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,000
You can go.

636
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,400
Excuse me.

637
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,390
Richard.
Richard.

638
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,070
Dad,you okay?

639
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,600
Richard?

640
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,870
Richard!
Richard!

641
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,020
Richard!

642
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:11,900
Richard.

643
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,020
You're standing.

644
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,440
Thank you.

645
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,160
he got up.

646
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,420
- I have to go tell house.
- No.

647
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:57,970
Cuddy.

648
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,840
You can't tell him.

649
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,870
I have to tell him.
He was right.

650
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,260
Why did you do it?

651
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,220
Why did you thinkhe might be right?

652
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,250
Because he's house.

653
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,960
Medically.
What made you thinkhe was right?

654
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,790
- Nothing.
- He got lucky.

655
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,800
That's all that happened.

656
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,540
Telling him nowas a good thing.

657
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,160
Because next time,he won't get lucky.
He'll kill someone.

658
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,170
Just becausehe was right doesn't
meanhe wasn't wrong.

659
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,950
I see him every day.

660
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,630
I can't just...

661
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,160
everybody lies.
