1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,400
Adam.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Eyes here.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,750
Follow my finger.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,480
Adam.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,670
Show me...

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,460
a bicycle.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,860
Eyes here.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,110
Adam.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,820
Show me a bicycle.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,510
No, buddy, that's a ball.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,460
Adam, look at me.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,260
Are you hungry?

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,220
Show me what you want for lunch.

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,340
Still Drawing those lines instead of looking at the cards.

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,250
More juice?

16
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,590
If he wants more juice, he has to ask for it.

17
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,640
Adam.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,170
Buddy, eyes here.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,390
He's tired, Dom.

20
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,090
Wouldn't be if we stuck to the schedule.

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,640
Show me the juice, buddy.

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,470
I think we've reached the point of diminishing returns.

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,970
He has to ask for it.

24
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,360
Adam.

25
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,660
He's choking.

26
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,490
That's impossible. It's mac and cheese.

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
House S03E04
Lines in the Sand

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,890
Ten-year-old boy, screams for his life for no reason.

29
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,820
He's autistic.

30
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,410
Severely autistic.

31
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,650
Can't talk, can't make eye contact.

32
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,990
Screaming's probably his way of communicating.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,380
And he went to three different doctors who all said just that.

34
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,630
Well, so clearly, that can't be the answer.

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,060
His brain can't filter information.

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,800
It's a constant assault on his senses.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,570
I'd scream too.

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,070
Or it's something medical sounding, like dysesthesia.

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,750
Parents are convinced that there's something wrong with their son.

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,160
Since when did we start believing parents?

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,940
Or anyone?

42
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,260
Where are we going?

43
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,020
Elevator.

44
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,600
Dad was on wall street, mom was a partner in an accounting firm.

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,010
When their son was diagnosed with autism, they both quit.

46
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,600
So they're overprotective and scared.

47
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,150
That's all the more reason to discount-- they study this kid.

48
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,170
Heard him scream a million times.

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,250
But in ten years of caring for him, this is the first time they've brought him to a hospital.

50
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,610
E.R. checked his throat. No obstructions, nothing.

51
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,000
Which means the only symptom was a scream, which is diagnostic of nothing.

52
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,010
Kid clutched his chest, B.P. was elevated.

53
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,070
Maybe there was chest pain.

54
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,010
E.R. said the heart was fine.

55
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,660
Don't be so quick to dismiss pain.

56
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,610
Where are we going?

57
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,940
Down.

58
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,790
Stool sample to check for parasites.

59
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,420
Blood culture to rule out infection.

60
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,070
And ana for lupus.

61
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,480
Because he screamed?

62
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,540
Could also be an environmental reaction.

63
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,400
An allergy.

64
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,960
Dust, wheat, pollen.

65
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,100
A toxin, or something he ate.
Check the house and run a lung ventilation scan.

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,690
Lungs are in the chest too, right?

67
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,620
I had a date last night.

68
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,270
She screamed.

69
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,160
Should we spend $100,000 testing her?

70
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,000
Of course not.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,860
This isn't a veterinary hospital.

72
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,070
Zing!

73
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,070
Look, if you don't think this kid is worth saving-- that's not what I'm saying.

74
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,800
Well, it's too bad.

75
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,800
It's a good point.

76
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,950
Kid's just a lump with tonsils.

77
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,500
You know what it's gonna be like ,trying to put an autistic kid into a nuclear scanner?

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,450
I don't envy you guys.

79
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,530
I want my old carpet back.

80
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,220
we're gonna have to do this later.

81
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,160
A kid...

82
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,970
in the clinic had an accident.

83
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,890
Generally, when people are on the-- I wanty old carpet back.

84
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,250
It was stained with blood.

85
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,500
Yeah, my blood.

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,980
Which makes the carpet part of me.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,050
I want it back.

88
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,190
I want to be buried with it.

89
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,280
You think you can get me to do anything you want, regardless of how stupid it is?

90
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,560
It's my office!

91
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,070
It's where I work. Where I think.

92
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:47,470
Where I save lives, allowing you to brag to rich people so they'll give you more money to spend on mris and low-cut tops.

93
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,060
I want it back the way it was.

94
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,730
It's identical to the old carpet.

95
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,160
Except without the hazardous biological waste.

96
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,340
I shall not return to my office until every patented durable micro fiber has been restored to its rightful place.

97
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,170
Inspiring.

98
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,830
You don't want to work in your office,work in the clinic.

99
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,360
You don't want to work in the clinic,go home.

100
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,940
And don't get paid.

101
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,830
Attica!

102
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,720
Attica?

103
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,800
He,uh,just needs to finish this level.

104
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,020
We only have the scanner up for the next half hour.

105
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,690
After that-- trust me.

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,210
You don't want to move him until he's finished.

107
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,630
Sooner we do this test,the sooner we can get you guys home.

108
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,570
Adam.

109
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,210
Do you think that-- that we--

110
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,230
Ten minutes,tops.

111
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,290
If he has a vascular disorder,he might not have that-- he might not have ten minutes?

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,770
I don't have ten minutes.

113
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,080
No,no,you don't-- want to do that--

114
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,000
Adam. Adam.

115
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,650
I used metamucil like the doctor told me and finally I was able to use the bathroom.

116
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,140
But I saw something in the toilet I couldn't identify.

117
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,230
I-I wrapped it in tissue paper --so you could take a look.

118
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,030
Couldn't you sedate him or something?

119
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,040
I could if I didn't want the test results to mean anything.

120
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,570
Painkillers, exercising.

121
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,010
We even did that puncture thing.

122
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,730
Nothing work then this morning, I get up, my back feels great.

123
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,180
I figured I'd betterget down here right away.

124
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,480
Big shocker-- Dad's depressed.

125
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,850
Save your time.

126
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,200
Ssris don't cause chest pain.

127
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,730
Every minute of every day is booked.

128
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,530
When he eats, sleeps, plays his handheld.

129
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,530
Not much of a life for them.

130
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,720
They chose to have a family.

131
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,500
You don't get to decide what your kid's gonna be like.

132
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,560
Nobody chooses this.

133
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,060
It's funny.

134
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,280
You get a normal kid, the parent works.

135
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:47,290
You get a special kid that costs more, they quit and turn the backyard into a therapy circuit.

136
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,790
Yes,if only you were handicapped.

137
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,630
All the good times you could've had with dad.

138
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,610
Hi, Dr. House.

139
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,870
Hello ,girl whose name I don't remember, but whose dad I treated, so I don't really know why she's here.

140
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,300
Ali.

141
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,920
Um, I think I caught what my dad has.

142
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,840
The rhino thing.

143
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,310
Right.

144
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,690
Does that hurt?

145
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,300
A little.

146
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,000
It's in my chest,too.

147
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,880
Of course it is.

148
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,680
Kinda had access through the shirt.

149
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,430
But... this'll work.

150
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,300
Feels good.

151
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,820
Exactly when did New Jersey run out of horny 17-year-old boys?

152
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,390
About five weeks ago.

153
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,910
It's been very lonely.

154
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,740
The ventilation scan was normal.

155
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,830
Time to send him home.

156
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,400
Can't leave right now.

157
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,530
Well, congratulations.

158
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,220
You are the proud owner of your very own rhino thing.

159
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,010
A rhinovirus-- you can't leave because she has a cold?

160
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,910
Can't leave because Cuddy says I can't leave.

161
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,280
All the tests are normal.

162
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,360
Okay, don't start with me.

163
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,890
We're backed up.

164
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,540
I know this is hard for all of us, but thanks to Dr. Cuddy,

165
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,670
I don't have an office.

166
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,670
So I have to work here.

167
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,300
What'd she do to your office?

168
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,090
It's unusable.

169
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,650
So whatever is bothering him, it wasn't his lungs.

170
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,580
What about the kid's house?

171
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,570
There were some pesticides and some alcohol, but the tox screen was negative.

172
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,990
Which means there's nothing physically wrong with this kid.

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,450
We already had that discussion.

174
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,790
We get a fecal smear?

175
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,570
Should we do this someplace else?

176
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,780
No, Cuddy says I have to work here.

177
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,890
No, I said you can work in your office or you had to work here.

178
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,390
And since I can't work in my office...

179
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,580
Is this your master plan?

180
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,480
Disrupt hospital business until I replace your carpet?

181
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,450
Devious.

182
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,330
Saw it in a James Bond movie.

183
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,640
Fecal smear!

184
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,720
- Talk to me.
- Get out of here.

185
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,490
- You'll put back my carpet?
- No.

186
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,310
Get out of here!

187
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,110
Fecal matter.

188
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,790
Is there a sample we can look at?

189
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,150
Parents have the smear kit.

190
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,580
The kid is constipated.

191
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,570
Do what you want.

192
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,890
Not replacing your carpet.

193
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,040
Go up his rear and get a smear.

194
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,750
Which reminds me, I kinda feel like a bagel.

195
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,180
Carpets.

196
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,100
We need a stool sample.

197
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,870
We should probably wait until he's finished playing that level, huh?

198
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,060
I actually think he's a bit better today.

199
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,700
He seems more like his old self.

200
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,770
It is possible that he was never sick.

201
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,960
I guess we, uh, could've overreacted.

202
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,990
So what makes fluid fill the lining of a kid's lungs?

203
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:19,860
Why are we in here?

204
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,930
Is this some sort of power play?

205
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,800
Yeah.

206
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,960
So you stuck your finger in the kid and gave him a pleural effusion.

207
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,100
You ever considered getting a manicure?

208
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,400
I took the stool sample after his lungs failed.

209
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,130
Or do you really have a problem with the carpeting?

210
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,200
Change sets you off-- I said it was a power play.

211
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,130
Someone answers "yes" to option A, you don't move on to option B.

212
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,710
If there's a pleural effusion, we have to rule out heart failure.

213
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,470
Why now?

214
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,060
Why a power play now?

215
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,910
I smelled weakness.

216
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,140
Get the kid an echocardiogram.

217
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,040
That's... funny.

218
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,380
It says "James Wilson." A strange typo.

219
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,620
If the fluid comes back an exudate, get him on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

220
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,530
Thank you for coming.

221
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,900
No problem.

222
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,010
Thought you wouldn't mind sharing offices for a while.

223
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,580
You share stories, feelings...

224
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,310
Toys.

225
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,030
You don't share offices.

226
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,530
That is so not zen.

227
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,900
It was a gift.

228
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,420
Some doctors get those.

229
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,770
So you want mornings or afternoons?

230
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:32,990
You couldn't make Cuddy miserable, so you're gonna make me miserable so I can make Cuddy miserable on your behalf?

231
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,810
Yeah.

232
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,860
What makes you think I can make her miserable?

233
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,060
Because you're good at that stuff.

234
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,130
Oh, I'm nothing compared to you.

235
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,410
Is there anything you'll throw out?

236
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,760
That's a gift from an 11-year-old patient of mine.

237
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,020
She and I both knew it was a piece of junk, and that's what made her laugh.

238
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:51,070
So you gotta keep it until she-- she already did.

239
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,280
Adam.

240
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,210
I need you to stay still, buddy.

241
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,660
it's okay, it's okay. I got him.

242
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,580
There we go.

243
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,150
Okay.

244
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,070
What?

245
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,480
What is it? Is his heart okay?

246
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,390
No.

247
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,510
Echo suggested a conduction abnormality.

248
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,020
EKG confirmed it.

249
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,280
Still doesn't explain the effusion.

250
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,380
The pleural fluid was an exudate.

251
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,430
We should be looking for something that explains both the heart and lung problems.

252
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,770
Infection, parasite, cancer.

253
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,090
Microbiology showed no organisms in the fluid, so forget infection.

254
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,880
It's not a power play.

255
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,540
Doing a differential in the clinic makes sense.

256
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,540
Piss Cuddy off.

257
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,720
Same thing with Wilson's office.

258
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,890
Works indirectly.

259
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,380
But now, we are in office space.

260
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,160
Because you don't want to be in your own office.

261
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,750
Which means this has nothing to do with Cuddy.

262
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,050
You really are obsessed with your carpets.

263
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,540
Which means-- What are you doing here?

264
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,170
I have this room booked from 2:00 to 3:00.

265
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Oh, 2:00 east coast time.

266
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,080
I thought you meant Pacific.

267
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,010
Which is...

268
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,640
Stupid of me, I guess.

269
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,270
What about parasites?

270
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,780
Stool sample was negative.

271
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,950
It's 2:00.

272
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,420
Oh, well, we should go, then.

273
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,820
That just leaves cancer.

274
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,980
Get a lung biopsy.

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,810
It took a half an hour to get the mask on the kid for the lung scan.

276
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,630
Oh, I'm sorry.

277
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,020
Was there somewhere you needed to be?

278
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,400
House.

279
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,410
Can we talk?

280
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,200
- Carpet?
- Never.

281
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,660
Nothing to talk about.

282
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,860
Your girlfriend called the clinic 15 times looking for you today.

283
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,920
Lot to discuss.

284
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,120
China patterns-- House.

285
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,290
She's a stalker.

286
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,220
Right.

287
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,870
Couldn't be that she finds me interesting.

288
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,770
Attractive.

289
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,860
Has to be that she's insane.

290
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,780
She's called you 15 times.

291
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,140
Your mother's not that interested in you.

292
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,190
Well, maybe I'd be better adjusted if she was.

293
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,340
- I'm notifying security.
- Is this about the carpet?

294
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,160
You think I'll back off if you block all my fun?

295
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,540
You better not be having fun.

296
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,350
I'm having fun.

297
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,320
I'm not having sex.

298
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
- She's dangerous.
- She's not dangerous.

299
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,910
She's pretty.

300
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,760
She's pretty.

301
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,080
Men are stupid.

302
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,040
I'm with you so far.

303
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,730
I'm notifying security.

304
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,430
Oh, give her a break.

305
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,830
She's not dangerous, she's...

306
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,340
insightful.

307
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,010
You can't stop our love!

308
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,760
Hey, you got a minute?

309
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,510
Yeah.

310
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,750
We have a ten-year-old with pleural effusion and conduction abnormality but no heart failure.

311
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,360
Was there a protein in the pleural fluid?

312
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,320
Yeah, that's why we're thinking cancer.

313
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,590
Non-hodgkin's, probably.

314
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,660
So we want to do a lung biopsy.

315
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,380
Lung biopsies usually come back negative.

316
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,500
So biopsy a lymph node under the arm.

317
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,960
That's probably something an oncologist should do, right?

318
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,200
There's nothing real tricky to it.

319
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,060
It's a biopsy.

320
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,710
Still, just to be safe, you mind?

321
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,900
For the love of god!

322
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,600
Can't somebody shut that kid up?

323
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,400
Some people are trying to work around here.

324
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,330
Why don't you show him a teddy bear or something?

325
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,250
Who are you?

326
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,150
Somebody you'll never send a a gift to.

327
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,330
This is Dr. House.

328
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,830
Your son's doctor.

329
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,760
High test, please.

330
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,670
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

331
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,160
Out of vicodin?

332
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,240
What are you doing?

333
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,300
Eating the red berries.

334
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,720
He trusted you.

335
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,030
No, that wasn't trust.

336
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,810
That was...

337
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,870
self-preservation.

338
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,580
No.

339
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,400
That was huge.

340
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,440
It was like a conversation.

341
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:25,530
A monk-- a monkey's afraid to eat the red berries until he sees another monkey eat them.

342
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,200
Monkey see, monkey do.

343
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,910
That's all it was.

344
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,350
Your kid's still just as messed up as when we admitted him.

345
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,320
That was sensitive.

346
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,330
You have pretty hair.

347
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,100
Hope is all those parents have going for them.

348
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,020
No, hope is what's making them miserable.

349
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,020
What they should do is get a cocker spaniel.

350
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,290
A dog would look them in the eye.

351
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,990
Wag his tail when he's happy.

352
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,760
Lick their face, show them love.

353
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,130
Is it so wrong for them to want to have a normal child?

354
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,120
It's normal to want to be normal.

355
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,170
Spoken likea true circle queen.

356
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,650
See, skinny, socially privileged white people get to draw this neat little circle.

357
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,500
And everyone inside the circle is normal.

358
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:27,760
Everyone outside the circle should be beaten, broken and reset so they can be brought into the circle.

359
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,290
Failing that, they should be institutionalized.

360
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,940
Or worse, pitied.

361
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,150
So it's wrong to feel sorry for this little boy?

362
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,360
Why would you feel sorry for someone who gets to opt out of the inane courteous formalities?

363
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,060
Which are utterly meaningless, insincere and therefore degrading?

364
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,550
This kid doesn't have to pretend to be interested in your back pain, or your excretions, or your grandma's itchy place.

365
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:54,610
Can you imagine how liberating it would be to live a life free of all the mind-numbing social niceties?

366
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,620
I don't pity this kid.

367
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,510
I envy him.

368
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,460
Uh, no cancer.

369
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,750
Because...

370
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,580
These aren't lymph cells.

371
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,290
Then what are they?

372
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,210
Liver cells.

373
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,280
Liver cells under his arm.

374
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,230
Wonder what he's got whereh is liver's supposed to be.

375
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,080
Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?

376
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,870
Make yourself at home.

377
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,920
So, you think maybe Grey's Anatomy got it all wrong?

378
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,580
Lymph system circulates fluid, not organ cells.

379
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,930
Cancer cells break into the lymphatic system all the time.

380
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,520
But we're not talking about cancer cells.

381
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,110
What's the difference between cancer cells and liver cells?

382
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,390
Why can one pass through walls but the other can't?

383
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,260
Cancer cells are damaged.

384
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,280
Lets them grow into blood vessels.

385
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,550
Go wherever they want.

386
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,040
So if the liver cells are damaged-- liver isn't damaged.

387
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,250
The tests were normal.

388
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,640
So if the liver cells are damaged, it's theoretically possible to pass into the lymphatic system.

389
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,760
Liver failure could also explain pleural effusion, even the heart issues.

390
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,960
Liver cells are fine.

391
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:28,580
He was immunized for hep A and B, and do you really think this kid is having unprotected sex or sharing needles?

392
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,030
Daddy does seem the type to use a rubber.

393
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,050
So it's not viral.

394
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,950
That just leaves "lotta-booze-irrhosis".

395
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,950
Our ten-year-old boy does not have a drinking problem or cirrhosis.

396
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,000
House, when we echoed his heart, we got a piece of his liver-- there was no scarring.

397
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,460
Cirrhosis explains the symptoms.

398
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,000
Heart problems, lungs-- look up "cirrhosis" in the dictionary.

399
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,130
It means "scarring".

400
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,580
Parents aren't doing or dosing this kid.

401
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,830
How would you know that?

402
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,050
Kid can't talk.

403
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,290
Why'd you think I took this case?

404
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,790
He's not gonna give away the ending.

405
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,330
They quit their jobs for him.

406
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,780
Yes, they are everything you'd want in a parent.

407
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,950
Unfortunately, their kid is nothing you'd want.

408
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,850
When a baby is born, it's perfect.

409
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,970
Little fingers, little toes.

410
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,140
Plump, perfect, pink.

411
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,260
And brimming with unbridled potential.

412
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,850
But then it's downhill.

413
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,300
Some hills steeper than others.

414
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,790
Parents get off on their kids' accomplishments-- (toy)Bend over and relax.

415
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,000
Cute.

416
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,940
They'll annoy you with trophy rooms and report cards.

417
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:34,390
Hell, they'll even show you a purple cow and tell you what a keen eye for color their kid has.

418
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,860
But this kid...

419
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,070
He doesn't smile, he doesn't hug them, he doesn't laugh.

420
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,440
His parents get nothing-- the right to brag that their kid picked orange juice out of a lineup.

421
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,120
So you figure they slip the kid a mickey so they don't have to deal.

422
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,240
Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis.

423
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,590
And don't try and pawn it off on Wilson-- he's gonna be busy with Cuddy.

424
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,810
My parents loved me unconditionally.

425
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,000
Get out of here.

426
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,210
Don't you think the restraining order's a little much?

427
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,050
He's not actually going to have sex with a 17-year-old patient.

428
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,050
I didn't think he was gonna ask me to dig a blood stained carpet out of a dumpster, either.

429
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,710
It might be easier in the long run.

430
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,740
Are we stopping here so House doesn't find us?

431
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,010
Unless you want to make out.

432
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,660
You want me to surrender to House's coup?

433
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,240
No, no, you proactively...

434
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,650
Give him what he wants.

435
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,580
I defeat him by surrendering to him.

436
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,990
He'll never see it coming.

437
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,660
Look, I'll pay for it myself.

438
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,790
What is it, a thousand bucks to carpet a room?

439
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,100
Actually, it's 400.

440
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,560
Oh-- Not doing it.

441
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,350
Liver biopsy?

442
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,440
They're doing it now.

443
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,560
How's it going?

444
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,030
Like a biopsy.

445
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,360
Needles, cells.

446
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,760
Screaming.

447
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,530
What'd you findin the stool sample?

448
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,890
You were too busy bothering Cuddy, but as discussed, it was negative for parasites.

449
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,170
Can we get out of here?

450
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,650
I didn't ask what you didn't find.

451
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,660
I asked what you did find in the stool sample.

452
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,350
Stool.

453
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,400
And traces of iron, zinc, calcium carbonate.

454
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,230
Can we leave?

455
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,040
What's the matter?

456
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,040
You afraid of the man?

457
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,950
Too late.

458
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,320
Leave my stuff alone!

459
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,560
You have a meeting with a Guggenheim in 15 minutes.

460
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,750
Wearing that?

461
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,820
I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna fire you.

462
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,090
- One.
- Calcium carbonate, that's an antidiarrheal, right?

463
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,790
- Two.
- You think that's significant?

464
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,730
You think hard poops is significant?

465
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,720
Two and a half?

466
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,180
Never threaten unless you're ready to deliver.

467
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,520
Makes you look weak.

468
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,930
Thank god you don't have children.

469
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,500
Dr. Cuddy.

470
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,070
Take a message.

471
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,700
Your patient is being rushed to cardiac ICU.

472
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,320
That's like the one thing that would get me outta here.

473
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,840
I'm sorry, you can't come in here now.

474
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,560
What's going on?

475
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,260
He's in v-fib.

476
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,910
Clear.

477
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,040
Charging.

478
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,890
Clear.

479
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,970
Charging.

480
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,850
Clear.

481
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,100
Charging.

482
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,070
Clear.

483
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,090
He's stable for the moment.

484
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,430
First-degree atrial ventricular block.

485
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,630
Okay.

486
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,720
What else do we know?

487
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,820
His liver's damaged, pleural effusion compromised his lung function.

488
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,090
biopsy was negative for cirrhosis.

489
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,620
Parents didn't poison their son.

490
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,660
It's not his liver, his heart, or his lungs.

491
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,360
It's the calcium carbonate in his stool.

492
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,310
Kid was constipated.

493
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,100
Parents probably just overdid it.

494
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,220
Or they didn't do it at all.

495
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,530
Calcium carbonate's also what's in chalk.

496
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,820
So he ate some chalk.

497
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,610
It isn't toxic-- Sure didn't cause the pleural effusion.

498
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,590
Forget the chalk.

499
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,770
You just said it was about the chalk.

500
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,830
Yes, and then I said, "forget the chalk".

501
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,600
You must be very confused.

502
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,220
This kid's got pica.

503
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,710
Take him to a buffet, he's gonna eat the table.

504
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,750
Or lead paint.

505
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,320
Level of lead in the blood was normal.

506
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,240
His tox screen was clean.

507
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,760
We're not looking for typical poisons.

508
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,920
We're looking for anything that he can put in his mouth.

509
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,840
Matches, spiders, bricks.

510
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,490
Pressure-treated wood used to contain arsenic.

511
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,820
Even better.

512
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,460
Hansel?

513
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,230
Get samples of the ginger bread house.

514
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,920
Bag everything.

515
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,310
You could get into a lot of trouble,being here.

516
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,910
I wanted to see you.

517
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,470
Yeah, I got that.

518
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,610
So did everyone else.

519
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,510
They think you're a stalker.

520
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,710
One could argue those people might be jealous of your attention.

521
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,130
Yes,I actually made that argument.

522
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,200
You going home?

523
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,920
That's the plan.

524
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,570
In Iceland, the age of consent is 14.

525
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,220
I'm surprised that tourism isn't a bigger industry up there.

526
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,420
So today I'm jailbait.

527
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,410
But in 22 weeks...

528
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,220
Anybody can do anything to me.

529
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,790
Will I be so different in 22 weeks?

530
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,080
22 weeks is enough for an embryo to grow arms and legs.

531
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,210
It's just a line.

532
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,690
An arbitrary line drawn by a bunch of sad, old men in robes.

533
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,730
Yeah.

534
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,000
Who cares what judges think?

535
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,820
Didn't think of youas a guy who followed rules just because they were rules.

536
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:13,080
You are... over ten years younger than me.

537
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,430
I said over.

538
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,680
Gotta go!

539
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,240
House.

540
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,510
Dr. Cuddy!

541
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,630
Do you happen to know the way to the Icelandic consulate?

542
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,620
This young woman, a stranger to me, was just asking directions.

543
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,460
Security was gonna call the police.

544
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,840
I don't want to do that to you.

545
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,730
Go home.

546
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,770
She needed a ride.

547
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,960
She got her on her own, she can get home on her own.

548
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,890
Now.

549
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:46,220
And if I see you on hospital grounds again, I will call the police.

550
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,160
After that look, I'm feeling a little frisky.

551
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,540
Looks like you're up.

552
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,820
I'm ovulating. Let's go.

553
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,110
The frisky, it went away.

554
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,080
House, this isn't a game.

555
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,600
If I leave her alone, can I have my carpet back?

556
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,050
No.

557
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,630
If I forget about my carpet, can I have her?

558
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,210
Jimsonweed.

559
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,920
Found a small patch of it in his backyard.

560
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,090
Jimsonweed contains atropine.

561
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,550
Poor man's acid.

562
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,130
Our kid's been tripping on Lucy in the sky with cubic zirconia.

563
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,540
Explains the pleural effusion, the heart arrhythmias.

564
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,510
Meeting here will do nothing to upset Cuddy.

565
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,720
I'm not trying to upset Cuddy.

566
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,190
I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with the patient.

567
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,260
Continue.

568
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:10,920
I'm done.

569
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,320
Jimsonweed doesn't explain the screaming.

570
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,270
You've obviously never had a bad trip.

571
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,680
I would've thought you'd try to accomplish two goals at once.

572
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,270
Why can't you be more like the other age-in appropriate girls who have a thing for me?

573
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,470
Just accept me for me.

574
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,280
Continue.

575
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,080
Treatment for jimsonweed od is physostigmine.

576
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,250
Kid's got heart issues.

577
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,320
The two don't mix.

578
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,700
We'd better make sure that's what he's got.

579
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,740
Serum from the lab in paterson is three days, minimum.

580
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,930
He won't survive three days.

581
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,600
What time does he wake up?

582
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,410
7:35 am.

583
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,440
Then what?

584
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,350
Walk me through it.

585
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,460
7:40 to 7:50, he goes to the toilet, washes his face.

586
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,320
What does this matter?

587
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,670
I'm trying to prove he ate the plant.

588
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,770
His schedule has nothing to do with jimsonweed.

589
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,870
There are two possibilities-- either the parents saw him eat the plant,

590
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,010
or the kid has unsupervised time and eats plants instead of playing with blocks.

591
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:02,200
Even if you find 15 minutes of free time outside, doesn't mean he spent it eating a bush.

592
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,160
So what do we do?

593
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:03,970
Nothing?

594
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,230
Wait for the kid to tell us?

595
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,730
What?

596
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,480
Where are you going?

597
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,400
To talk to him.

598
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,130
Ever see your son eat a bush?

599
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:27,870
I haven't.

600
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,360
I've only ever seen him eat what--

601
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,570
Adam, you ate something at your house.

602
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,360
Something that made you sick.

603
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,820
I need you to show me what you ate.

604
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,390
He can't answer you.

605
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,980
Neither can you.

606
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,930
This is your backyard.

607
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,420
You may know it as Mel's diner.

608
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,110
This is your sandbox.

609
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,020
Your jungle gym.

610
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,690
And under it is this.

611
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,010
I need to know if you ate this, Adam.

612
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,360
He doesn't know what you want.

613
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,130
Adam, you have to tell me.

614
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,600
Because if you don't...

615
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,210
It'll be game over.

616
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,340
- You'll be dead.
- What the hell are you doing?

617
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,370
Show me what you ate.

618
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,250
Adam.

619
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,620
Show me what you ate.

620
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Sandbox

621
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,640
- Adam?
- Honey?

622
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,450
Adam?

623
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,430
Come on in, brothers and sister!

624
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,560
Welcome to the house of the lord.

625
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,030
House, come on.

626
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:58,780
The chapel?

627
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,810
We have been blessed with the miracle of a new symptom.

628
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:09,220
Brother, can you testify as to why this poor child's eyeball rolled back into his head?

629
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,980
It's consistent with jimsonweed poisoning-- ocular paralysis.

630
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,580
Sorry.

631
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,350
The wicked shall deceive ye, because they have turned from the Lord and are idiots.

632
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,900
His ocular muscle didn't paralyze, it pirouetted.

633
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,720
M.S.

634
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,880
It is easier for a wise man to gain access to heaven

635
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,430
Will you stop doing that? Just say "not M.S".

636
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,370
A stroke.

637
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,590
Bleed in the brain.

638
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,960
We'd be seeing other symptoms besides a single eye misalignment.

639
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,630
Like a coma.

640
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,000
And you've already testified.

641
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,440
It's a tumor.

642
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,600
And all the imaging just missed it?

643
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,150
It's a microtumor.

644
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,450
Started in his lung, which caused the pleural effusion.

645
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:45,530
Then it metastasized to his liver, which made it slough cells.

646
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,950
And then went to his brain, behind the eye, which caused it to roll back into his head.

647
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,510
So he has three tumors and we missed all of them.

648
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,810
What's the opposite of a miracle?

649
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,660
I have a better chance of finding it now that I know exactly where to look.

650
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,020
So...

651
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,230
Unless you have a better idea, I'm gonna go CT his head.

652
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,830
And then, if--if I have to, remove his eye.

653
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:17,600
You remove this kid's eye, he's only gonna behalf as good at not making eye contact.

654
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,840
Hello?

655
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,890
Hello?

656
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,100
Hello?

657
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,280
I have sad news for you.

658
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,870
She doesn't love you.

659
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,640
You're ugly when you're jealous.

660
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,550
She showed up at my house last night.

661
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,530
Came on to me.

662
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,430
She's even more perfect than I thought.

663
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,770
House.

664
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,320
She's sick.

665
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,920
You say "sick", I say "freestylin'".

666
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,310
The girl will have sex with an invertebrate.

667
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:56,990
Come on.

668
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,850
You're not that bad.

669
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,580
She has a problem.

670
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
You're not doing her any favors by indulging her.

671
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,380
Why would you lie like this?

672
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,380
Do you not have room your heart for love?

673
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,690
You don't believe me.

674
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,540
I didn't believe the kids when they said that Susie was sleeping with Johnny.

675
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,940
I didn't believe them then, I don't believe them now.

676
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,040
I don't care that Susie married Johnny-- he's mine.

677
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,370
She has a mole on her right breast, just below the nipple.

678
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,550
No, she doesn't.

679
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,780
You've seen her breasts?

680
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,150
It was a medical exam.

681
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,300
I was listening to her heart.

682
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,640
It went, "Greg-House, Greg-House, Greg-House."

683
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,160
Fine, I'm lying.

684
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,400
But she did come back.

685
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,310
She's locked up in my office.

686
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,090
I was hoping you could talk to her.

687
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,910
Put an end to this.

688
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,260
Listen to me.

689
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,790
Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed with me?

690
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,670
Nine chances out of ten, we'd both wind up in a jail.

691
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,150
You're only saying that to make me go.

692
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,910
I'm saying it 'cause it's true.

693
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,990
Inside of us, we both know that you belong with Victor.

694
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,370
Is there a Victor in your class?

695
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:29,650
If you're not with someone your age, you'll regret it.

696
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,510
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon.

697
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,520
And for the rest of your life.

698
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,030
What about us?

699
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,780
We'll always have Fresno.

700
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,250
I'm no good at being noble,

701
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:51,220
but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of two little people dot amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

702
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,580
Someday you'll understand that.

703
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,320
Now, now.

704
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,220
Here's looking at you...

705
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,920
Damn.

706
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,490
Was there an earthquake when you were in Fresno?

707
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,520
What?

708
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,080
I ask all my girlfriends that.

709
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:22,400
Yeah, a little one.

710
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,410
Damn.

711
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,390
What?

712
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,360
What, what is it?

713
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,460
It's not love.

714
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,260
You have a spore in your brain.

715
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,180
Coccidioides immitis.

716
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,450
California's full of 'em.

717
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:38,400
They get an earthquake, they get released into the air, you breathe it in, you get a cold...

718
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,090
Turns into sinus congestion, aches, weakness...

719
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,350
Milky tears...

720
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,760
And sometimes...

721
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,040
A loss of inhibition and judgment.

722
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,670
Damn!

723
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,040
So...

724
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,090
loving you?

725
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,190
Wanting to have sex with you?

726
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,640
It was all just...

727
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,740
the spores talking?

728
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,170
You'll probably live.

729
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,740
Damn.

730
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,090
Hey!

731
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,100
Don't touch his eye.

732
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,640
This is an appendectomy.

733
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,780
Like i said, don't touch his eye.

734
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,490
Why isn't he in surgery?

735
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,540
Well, some emergency bumped him.

736
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,900
We've got another room in ten minutes.

737
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,630
You're not taking him in.

738
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,340
Kill the lights.

739
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,300
He was seeing them all the time.

740
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,700
What are you looking for?

741
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,290
And he was telling us what he was seeing.

742
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,880
Telling us exactly what was wrong with him.

743
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,740
Drawing them for us over and over again.

744
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,470
Nobody knew how to speak "autistic".

745
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,840
When I asked him what he ate, he even told me that.

746
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,680
What are you talking about?

747
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,630
What was he seeing?

748
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,110
Hello, my pretties.

749
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,860
It's not a tumor, Foreman.

750
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,790
It's worms.

751
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,760
Swimming in his eye.

752
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,570
Animal makes potty in the sandbox.

753
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,860
Boy plays in the sandbox, boy eats the sand.

754
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,830
You can probably tell where this is going by now.

755
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,510
Stool samples were negative for parasites.

756
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,470
Raccoon roundworms are not excreted by their human host.

757
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,860
Cameron tested the sand.

758
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,410
All of it?

759
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:46,260
Worms spread from his gut to the rest of his body.

760
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,320
They attacked his lungs.

761
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,760
That's what made him scream and caused the effusion.

762
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,430
They invade his liver, sending dead liver cells coursing through his system.

763
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:58,530
They attack his eyeand the muscles surrounding it, making his eyeball do a backflip.

764
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,270
Laser photocoagulation to fix the eye and a high dose of benzimidazole to kill the worms.

765
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,350
Wait a minute.

766
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,360
That's it?

767
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,450
H-he's gonna be okay?

768
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,090
Good news.

769
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,440
He's gonna be with you for a long, long time.

770
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,340
I'm going to read you something.

771
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:26,630
"Asperger's syndrome is a mild and rare form of autism".

772
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,760
"It is typically characterized by difficulty establishing friendshipsand playing with peers,

773
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:38,450
trouble accepting convential social rules, and they dislike any change in setting or routine."

774
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,080
Or broadloom.

775
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,250
It doesn't say that last part, but you get my point.

776
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,720
House doesn't have Asperger's.

777
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,770
The diagnosisis much simpler.

778
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,850
He's a jerk.

779
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,780
Why do you think he took this case?

780
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,520
Because he believes these parents?

781
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,720
Because he wants to help a young boy?

782
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,680
He sees himself in this kid.

783
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,080
And he's trying to help himself.

784
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,030
He doesn't want this.

785
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,930
He needs it.

786
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,380
You're not autistic.

787
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,930
You don't even have Asperger's.

788
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,310
You wish you did.

789
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,430
It would exempt you from the rules.

790
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,590
Give you freedom, absolve you of responsibility.

791
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,690
Let you date 17-year-olds.

792
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,240
But most important, it would mean that you're not just a jerk.

793
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:40,300
At what point does a person endlessly lecturing someone make him a jerk?

794
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,380
Your first tongue kiss...

795
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,870
An eight on the happiness scale.

796
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:57,100
Your child being snatched back from the brink of death...

797
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,930
That's a ten.

798
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,260
But they're clocking in at a very tepid 6.5,

799
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,500
because they know what they have to go back to.

800
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,030
Uh, listen...

801
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,990
Thanks.

802
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,710
You saved his life.

803
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,290
Yeah, I know.

804
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,790
See ya.

805
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,020
That was so good.

806
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,380
That was a ten.

807
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,640
All change is bad?

808
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,920
It's not true, you know.

809
