1
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,239
Yo, yo!

2
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,080
Turn that back on.
What the hell, Garcia?

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,005
Put it back on!

4
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:37,665
Don't look at me,
'cause you know I didn't do it.

5
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:38,833
All right?
Don't look at me.

6
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,609
Hey, you better have put
fresh batteries

7
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,006
in that thing,
like I told you.

8
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:44,111
I did, Sarge, right when you--
when you gave it to me, I-I did.

9
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,123
I put 'em in.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,725
Well, then, hit it
or something.

11
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:49,835
Otherwise, y'all are gonna
have to listen to me sing!

12
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:25,605
Here.

13
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:29,509
All right, don't panic.

14
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,215
Don't shoot us,

15
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:32,900
and don't die.

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,035
You got it, G?

17
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:59,030
Up and at 'em.

18
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,918
You're supposed to be
in clinic duty.

19
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:04,992
Yeah, like I can
sleep down there

20
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,693
with all the crying
and coughing.

21
00:02:08,064 --> 00:02:09,726
Here.
Ex-Marine.

22
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:11,551
Thinks he has
Gulf War Syndrome.

23
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:13,478
There's no such thing.

24
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:14,571
So he's been told.

25
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:17,502
It hasn't stopped
the unexplained fatigue, rashes,

26
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:18,476
and joint pain.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,919
And just so you know,
he's the nephew

28
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,421
of a benefactor
I owe a favor,

29
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:24,211
so you're gonna take this case
whether you like it or not.

30
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:26,364
Why wouldn't I want
to take the case?

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,309
The guy's tired and sore.

32
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:31,658
It's gonna be chapter one
in my--

33
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,206
Don't panic.

34
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:39,794
Don't shoot us,

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,276
and don't die.

36
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,011
You know him?

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,423
Never met him before
in my life.

38
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,827
Okay, well,
you're about to.

39
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:51,919
He's on his way here.

40
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,013
Get your ass up
and get your team together.

41
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:54,906
You have work to do.

42
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:23,846
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

43
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:35,241
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@MAOREN Sync:FRM@??·?</font>

44
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:41,782
That's amazing.

45
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:43,093
No, it's not.

46
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:45,029
It's not?

47
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:46,723
I can play the harmonica
with my nose,

48
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:49,002
make a penny come out
of a child's ear--

49
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:51,259
or any other orifice,
for that matter--

50
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:52,814
and, given the right
circumstances,

51
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:55,164
can bring two women
to simultaneous ecstasy.

52
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:56,434
The right circumstances be

53
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:59,032
their agreement to bill youyoon the

54
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,523
And what I absolutely
cannot do

55
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,936
is dream about someone
I've never seen before.

56
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:05,549
Well, just because
you don't understand it

57
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:06,772
doesn't mean
it can't happen.

58
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:08,006
True...

59
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:10,856
it can't happen
because it can't happen!

60
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:13,071
Well, maybe you didn't

61
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:15,281
dream about this guy
specifically.

62
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:18,989
Right, just some other guy
who looks exactly like him.

63
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,138
No, you imagined
some generic Marine,

64
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:23,143
then you placed his face
in the dream

65
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:24,277
after you saw the picture.

66
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:26,742
Sort of a coincidence
mixed with a little d?j?vu.

67
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:29,574
There's no record of him
ever coming into the clinic.

68
00:04:29,574 --> 00:04:31,779
So I must have seen him before
somewhere else.

69
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,439
Fine, you've known him
since Cub Scouts.

70
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,778
A more interesting question
isn't what you dreamed, but why?

71
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:39,721
I'm guessing
you're longing for either

72
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:41,421
a renewed relationship
with your dad...

73
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:45,401
or a new relationship
with one of the Village Peop

74
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:47,072
He wasthe Navy,
not the Marines.

75
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:48,699
I thought your dad
was in the Marines.

76
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:51,338
The guy
in the Village People.

77
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:54,818
Actually, he's only in the Navy
when they sing In the Navy.

78
00:04:54,818 --> 00:04:57,925
The rest of the time,
he's just in generic fatigues.

79
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,251
What?

80
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:02,644
You brought it up.

81
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:05,940
You didn't flush.

82
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,257
I didn't pee.

83
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:12,683
Male. 34.

84
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:15,279
Just got out of the Marines
after two years in Iraq.

85
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,988
Admitted complaining
of chronic fatigue,

86
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:20,198
joint pains,
intermittent rashes,

87
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:21,324
and sore throats.

88
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:23,856
Thinks he has
Gulf War Syndrome.

89
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,956
Why is he here
instead of the VA?

90
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:26,242
Because he has a rich uncle

91
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,062
Cuddy's
trying to avoid fellating

92
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,654
who doesn't buy
the VA's diagnosis

93
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:31,137
of "nothing's wrongatosis."

94
00:05:31,137 --> 00:05:32,502
The VA's right.

95
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:34,745
There's no such thing
as Gulf War Syndrome,

96
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:37,015
especially in veterans who've
never served in the Gulf War.

97
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:38,157
Different war, same place.

98
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:40,809
Whatever was tern 1990
is still there.

99
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:42,884
What's there can
send you home in a pine box,

100
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,184
but it can't get you sick three
months after you've gotten home.

101
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:49,277
What, so thousands of soldiers
are lying about their symptoms?

102
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:52,444
You send 700,000 people
on vacation to Hawaii,

103
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:53,691
some are gonna come back sick.

104
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:55,039
Doesn't mean it was
caused by snorkeling.

105
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,647
He's right.

106
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,763
The studies all show
the same pattern of symptoms

107
00:05:57,763 --> 00:05:59,559
in veterans who were sent to
the Gulf and those who weren't.

108
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,971
That's it?
You believe her but not me?

109
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:04,223
Stick to your guns, Chase.

110
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,745
Just 'cause there isn't
a sing unifying symptom

111
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:08,461
doesn't mean there isn't
something going on.

112
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:10,241
It could just affect
everyone differently.

113
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:12,391
You think this guy has
Gulf War Syndrome?

114
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:13,238
'Course not.

115
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:16,106
He's depressed, and he's looking
for a disability check.

116
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:18,116
Most likely because
he's just realized

117
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:20,668
that knowing how to
barter for sex in six languages

118
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:22,703
and open a beer bottle
with your eye socket

119
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:24,188
are not the most
marketable skills.

120
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:25,298
Why'd you take this case?

121
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:27,448
Because a good scientistTA
continually questions

122
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:29,373
his own theories
and assumptionsu

123
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:30,577
Cuddy's making him.

124
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:31,789
Now I'm making you.

125
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,471
Do a full physical.

126
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,132
Recheck his blood
for HIV, Hep C, malaria,

127
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:37,129
schistosomiasis,

128
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,469
and "T strain" A. baumannii

129
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:40,666
just to make sure
the VA's dotted their Is.

130
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,216
And find out every hospital
and clinic he's ever visited,

131
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:44,788
every city
he's ever lived in, and...

132
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,677
whether he's ever been
on TV.

133
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:49,047
TV?

134
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:51,321
Problem
could be neurological.

135
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:53,762
Everyone knows
TV rots your brain.

136
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:58,002
It's usually the worst
on my palms

137
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,207
and the bottoms of my feet.

138
00:07:00,372 --> 00:07:02,214
I get these
black dots all over.

139
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:03,951
I don't see anything.

140
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:05,022
It comes and goes.

141
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,371
You sure it's not
just scrapes and bruises?

142
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:10,939
I know the difference
between a rash and a bruise.

143
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,283
Sometimes it's harder
than you realize

144
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:14,443
to distinguish
between the two.

145
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:16,096
You obviously exercise.

146
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,862
My problems aren't caused
by my workouts.

147
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:19,449
But you do work out,

148
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,663
and by the look of you,
pretty strenuously.

149
00:07:21,663 --> 00:07:23,734
That's not usually
the case with patients

150
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,152
whose principal complaint is
chronic fatigue and joint pain.

151
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:27,558
I was in the Marines
for 12 years.

152
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,580
I'm used to doing PT
every day.

153
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,541
Just because I can push
through the pain

154
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,715
doesn't mean it's not there.

155
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:34,394
Listen, we're not saying
we don't believe you.

156
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:35,415
The hell you aren't.

157
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:37,315
We just need to be specific

158
00:07:37,315 --> 00:07:39,065
about what exactly
the problems are.

159
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:44,840
I sleep ten hours a night,
but I feel tired all the time.

160
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,039
I constantly get coughs,
rashes, sore throats.

161
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:49,748
My knees and hips feel like

162
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:51,234
someone poured sand
in my joints.

163
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:53,912
I get these weird tingling
sensations in my legs.

164
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:54,925
Sometimes, they're cold.

165
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:57,450
Other times,
feels like my blood is boiling.

166
00:07:58,287 --> 00:07:59,761
Specific enough?

167
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:04,875
Look, I don't care
what you guys call it--

168
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,639
Gulf War Syndrome,
Iraq Fever,

169
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,445
or jusorCrappy Sickness X.

170
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:11,542
I just want someone
to figure out what it is

171
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:12,456
so they can cure it.

172
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:16,246
Except for the supposed
pain in his joints,

173
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,009
none of the other symptoms
he's complaining about

174
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:18,936
are currently evident.

175
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:21,136
Besides low potassium
probably caused

176
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:23,063
by him over hydrating
after working out,

177
00:08:23,063 --> 00:08:24,403
his blood work's
all normal.

178
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,678
Low potassium could also
probably be caused

179
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:28,022
by the experiments
or vaccines

180
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:29,394
in anti-chemical
warfare pills

181
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:31,343
he was given before
he deployed to Iraq.

182
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,815
Not to mention the fact
that whole country's littered

183
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:35,415
with hundreds of tons
of radioactive shrapnel

184
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,093
from depleted
uranium munitions.

185
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:38,766
Did you go to medical school
in France?

186
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:40,565
There's no trace of uranium
in his urine.

187
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:42,905
And he was given the vaccines
and meds two years ago

188
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,606
without any allergic
or adverse reaction.

189
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:46,738
Has he ever done
any modeling?

190
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:48,461
We forgot to ask.

191
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:51,615
We should send his urine
to the University of Leicester.

192
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,876
There's a professor there
who's developed

193
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:54,554
a more advanced screening
technique for uranium.

194
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:56,711
If the levels are too low
for us to detect,

195
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:58,957
they're way too low
to cause any damage.

196
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,991
Where you goin'?

197
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,114
This way.

198
00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:05,685
Did you find out about
any television

199
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:06,874
or other media exposure?

200
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:07,897
Do you really care?

201
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:09,346
Or are you just trying
to waste hospital resources

202
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:11,218
to get back at Cuddy
for making you take the case?

203
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,472
Of course I care.

204
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:14,721
What a horrible thing
to say.

205
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,226
Do a LexisNexis search.
Get a copy of his credit report.

206
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:20,873
Before or after
we tell him to eat a banana

207
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:22,114
and discharge him
with a psych referral?

208
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:23,099
I say before.

209
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:25,912
And I say in-between,
give him a polysomnogram.

210
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:29,153
Sleep apnea can cause
chronic fatigue and paranoia.

211
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,726
Find out where he went
to summer camp.

212
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,866
Are you okay?

213
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:38,692
Yeah, it's just

214
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:40,258
a little too much coffee
this morning.

215
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:42,496
Were we...
walking you to the bathroom?

216
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,208
I wish.

217
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,391
Wilson was just in there.

218
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:49,294
These guys know
what I'm talking about.

219
00:09:53,577 --> 00:09:54,492
That's his third REM cycle,

220
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:55,785
and his breathing's
completely normal.

221
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:58,077
There's obviously nothing
wrong with his sleep pattern.

222
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,347
If it's not uranium,

223
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:00,874
it's gotta be some other
sort of toxin.

224
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:02,001
Or nothing at all.

225
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,755
You really think
there's something wrong,

226
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:05,151
or do you just want
Foreman to be wrong?

227
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:06,510
Bo.

228
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:08,879
Well, it's not
his sleep pattern.

229
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,354
If you really think
it's a toxin,

230
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:11,759
you can do a liver biopsy
in the morning.

231
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,180
We can't leave.

232
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,737
If we don't monitor
the whole test,

233
00:10:14,737 --> 00:10:15,988
House won't accept
thresults.

234
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:17,377
He'll just make us
do it over.

235
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:18,870
It doesn't take two doctors
to monitor

236
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,589
what's clearly gonna be
a normal polysomnogram.

237
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:24,054
Oh, so you want me
to stay?

238
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:25,532
You're the one who thought
there was something wrong.

239
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:27,628
I never said it was
a sleep disorder.

240
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,832
You wanna flip for it?

241
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,060
Just go.

242
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:34,582
Oh, come on.

243
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:36,596
Don't be a baby.

244
00:10:38,782 --> 00:10:41,847
Fine.
I'll stay.

245
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:49,396
You know what we could do.

246
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:56,250
Here?

247
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,950
Why not?

248
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,068
We're surrounded by
empty rooms with beds in them.

249
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:01,400
Yeah, and video cameras
too.

250
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,494
So we turn 'em off.

251
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:05,359
That's all I need is House
or Foreman walking in on us.

252
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,284
We have the keys.

253
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:10,692
No.
What if he wakes up?

254
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,119
All right.

255
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:18,360
Suit yourself.

256
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:38,982
Damn it!

257
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:26,061
Hello?

258
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:28,775
Is anybody out there?

259
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:32,894
I think there's
a problem in here!

260
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:37,535
What's wrong?

261
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:39,465
u mean, what's wrong?
You don't smell that?

262
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:41,797
Nothing smells, John.

263
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:44,394
Are you kidding me?
It's disgusting.

264
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:46,920
How long have you thought--
Wait.

265
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:49,536
Open your mouth.

266
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,402
Smell's not in the room.
It's in your mouth.

267
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:00,398
What's going on?

268
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:41,445
What?

269
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,899
You were wrong about
the "nothing's wrongatosis."

270
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:46,175
You can fake fatigue
and joint paint,

271
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,920
but you can't fake bacterial
vaginosis in your mouth.

272
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,989
Where's his mouth been?

273
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:51,976
Says he hasn't performed
oral sex on anyone

274
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:52,594
in over a year.

275
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:54,460
Selfish bastard.

276
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,410
Because he hasn't been
with anyone

277
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,216
since his last girlfriend
dumped him

278
00:13:58,216 --> 00:13:59,788
and after he deployed
to Iraq the second time.

279
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:01,044
Selfish bitch!

280
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:03,770
We've ruled out HIV,
diabetes,

281
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,619
and any other
endocrine abnormality.

282
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:08,075
Could be autoimmune; Sjoegren's
decreases salivary flow,

283
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:09,688
creates a hospitable home
for bacteria.

284
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:11,333
No, his eyes
and tear ducts are fine.

285
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,905
Who was his last
girlfriend?

286
00:14:13,535 --> 00:14:15,522
Yeah, we'll...
get right on that.

287
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,615
Chronic fatigue,
joint pain,

288
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:20,099
and opportunistic infection
spells cancer.

289
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,766
Probably lymphoma.

290
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:24,955
We should biopsy his tonsillar
and submandibular lymph nodes.

291
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:27,839
Right about cancer.
Wrong about lymphoma.

292
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,557
Unless you're simply
hiding the fact

293
00:14:29,557 --> 00:14:30,842
that his lymph nodes
are swollen.

294
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:33,425
Get Wilson to biopsy
his salivary glands.

295
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:34,657
He's got parotid cancer.

296
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:36,364
And see if you can
get to the truth

297
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:37,407
about who he's been dating.

298
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:39,075
No way a Marine goes aear

299
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,153
without getting some blood
on his bayonet.

300
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:43,495
It's not an STD.
You just said--

301
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:44,324
Just do it.

302
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:48,832
The antibiotics

303
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:50,316
should at least
relieve the infection,

304
00:14:50,316 --> 00:14:52,409
also reduce the odor
and taste in your mouth.

305
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:53,821
Not soon enough.

306
00:14:59,098 --> 00:14:59,617
All right.

307
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:01,551
You're gonna feel
a little burn.

308
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,826
You know,
I never even dipped.

309
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:06,007
Chewing tobacco.

310
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:08,788
Practically everyone
in my unit did but me.

311
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:11,498
I was so paranoid
about cancer.

312
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:14,549
Well, if it's parotid
cancer,

313
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:17,247
it's very treatable
if diagnosed early.

314
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:19,833
My mom had cancer.

315
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,096
Which is why I know
that diagnosing cancer early

316
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:23,991
means before there's
any serious symptoms.

317
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:32,275
Certainly tastes like a pretty
serious symptom, you know?

318
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,174
We'll know more
after the test.

319
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:38,256
If he was just trying
to mess with Cuddy

320
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:40,437
for wasting his time,
,this would have stopped

321
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:42,544
as soon as the patient started
exhibiting actual symptoms.

322
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:44,777
So the question is,
why is he wasting our time?

323
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,531
Or is he wasting
our time?

324
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:48,067
You think
he's got a medical reason

325
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,526
for asking for the guy's
credit report?

326
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:50,434
I don't.

327
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:53,164
Where were you two
when the guy woke up?

328
00:15:56,236 --> 00:15:57,297
Uh, we just--

329
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:58,846
stepped out for a second.

330
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:00,324
To do what?

331
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,651
To...get a coffee.

332
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:04,142
We'd been up
most of the night.

333
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:07,331
He's just pushing to make sure
we have a complete history.

334
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:08,712
Obviously,
we're missing something,

335
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:09,396
or we'd have the answer.

336
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:12,485
You didn't have any coffee
when you came back.

337
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,622
All right, already.
We confess cu caught us.

338
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:19,762
We snuck into one of the
sleep lab rooms to have sex.

339
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:20,973
We shouldn't have done it while
we were supposed to be working,

340
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:21,801
and we're sorry.

341
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:23,246
Now can we move on?

342
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:29,136
House'll do Wilson
before you do Chase.

343
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:32,421
No, you would do House
and Wilson

344
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:33,299
before I do Chase.

345
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,235
Now can we get back
to work?

346
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:37,098
She did me once.

347
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:39,526
She was stoned!

348
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,543
Biopsy's inconclusive.

349
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:55,684
I'm gonna do a sialogram
27ile we wait

350
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:57,020
for the results
from the additional blood work.

351
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,791
No hurry.

352
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,793
Probably nothing
we can do at this point anyway.

353
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:01,473
As long as the cancer
hasn't spread.

354
00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:02,904
He's spitting stink.

355
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:04,932
You should focus
on the living.

356
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,276
I need a prescription.

357
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,119
I just wrote you
a prescription.

358
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,423
For Vicodin.
I need alfuzosin.

359
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:13,962
No, you don't.

360
00:17:15,106 --> 00:17:16,580
Have you figured out
where you met your Marine?

361
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,009
What?

362
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:20,264
Oh, that.

363
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:21,995
Haven't really
thought about it.

364
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,520
I can't pee.

365
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,308
You can't remember him,
can you?

366
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:28,050
I can't pee.

367
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,808
So stop taking the Vicodin.

368
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,939
I wanna pee and
not be in pain.

369
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:33,104
Why don't you go to sleep?

370
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:35,235
I don't pee
when I'm asleep.

371
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:36,667
Maybe you'll dream
about him again.

372
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:37,726
Maybe he'll give you
an address.

373
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:39,969
I haven't peed
in three days.

374
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,012
I read that REM sleep

375
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:42,394
is the brain's way
of working out problems.

376
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,924
Very useful.
Did you hear what I just said?

377
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:46,706
Yeah, you lied
because you want to avoid

378
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:47,719
talking about your obsession.

379
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:49,040
I'm not obsessing.

380
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,473
Why don't you
just ask him?

381
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:52,279
I haven't peed
in three days!

382
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,292
You'd be dead.

383
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:55,192
I'm not counting
intermittent drips.

384
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:56,664
You'd be in agony.

385
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:59,009
I passed agony yesterday
around 4:00.

386
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,110
His mother, brother,
uncle, and best friend

387
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,442
all confirm he hasn't
had a date in over a year.

388
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:23,209
Which means
it not an STD.

389
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:25,858
If you come up with something
medically relevant, page me.

390
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:34,657
What did you want me
to tell him, the truth?

391
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:38,102
No. You didn't have
to be so convincing.

392
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:40,139
Don't worry.
I'll make it up to you.

393
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:43,578
This is getting
out of control.

394
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:45,317
Don't pout.

395
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:47,913
Our patient woke up
with an infection

396
00:18:47,913 --> 00:18:49,389
while we were getting
our ros off.

397
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:52,757
Do you want to stop?

398
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,631
No.

399
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:57,619
But, uh, I don't want
to get caught either.

400
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:58,795
You think I do?

401
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:01,159
You certainly
didn't go out of your way

402
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:03,068
to keep the volume down
when we were in the sleep lab.

403
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:04,438
I couldn't help that.

404
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:08,439
Why would I
wanna get caught?

405
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,232
Maybe you wanna give House
a reason to be jealous.

406
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:15,006
I'm over House.

407
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:17,848
All this is
is uncomplicated sex.

408
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:19,067
Don't try to make it
more than that.

409
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:20,915
I'm not doing it
at work anymore.

410
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:23,232
Fine.

411
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,585
Wanna go grab some lunch?

412
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:42,245
I think the in
is the way to go.

413
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:44,537
We haven't had a condom
break t, thank God,

414
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:46,105
but it's bound to happen.

415
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:47,852
Especially the way
we've been doing it.

416
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:50,852
On a bed of nails?

417
00:19:50,852 --> 00:19:52,974
No. He's not kinky.

418
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,301
He's just...

419
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:55,898
insatiable.

420
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:58,464
I can barely make it to any
of my morning classes.

421
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,912
You smoke?

422
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,046
No way.

423
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:05,048
Stop it!

424
00:20:05,048 --> 00:20:06,576
Sorry.

425
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:11,191
Any history of hypertension,

426
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:12,620
blood clots, strokes?

427
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,734
Nope. Besides my OCD,
I'm fit as a fiddle.

428
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,610
You have OCD?

429
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,734
Duh. Can't you tell?

430
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:23,060
Any other compulsions

431
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,281
besides drinking
massive amounts of water?

432
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:26,984
No, that's it,
thank God.

433
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:29,252
My therapist says
it could be a lot worse.

434
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:30,841
You get up in the middle
of the night to drink?

435
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:32,855
Yeah, every couple
of hours.

436
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:35,715
Well, then your therapist
is an idiot.

437
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:37,927
Unconscious people
don't have OCD.

438
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:40,707
They can, however,
have diabetes insipidus.

439
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:43,696
That's impossible.
I eat candy all the time.

440
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:45,030
Different kind
of diabetes.

441
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,126
This kind is caused
by a banged-up pituitary.

442
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:49,339
You're obviously more
of a lover than a fighter.

443
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:51,030
I'm guessing either
a car accident

444
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,382
or...you cracked your skull
on the bal tce beam.

445
00:20:56,161 --> 00:20:56,995
How'd you know?

446
00:20:56,995 --> 00:20:59,120
Easy.
Nice ass, no boo,

447
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,387
You got palms
like a longshoreman.

448
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:03,659
Wait here.
You need a CAT scan.

449
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:04,666
Oh, my God.

450
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,350
Don't worry,
just means you'll be taking

451
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,067
two hormone supplements
d of one.

452
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,750
Okay, this time you're
gonna feel a little pressure.

453
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,714
We're injecting
the contrast material.

454
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,080
Could you turn up
the music?

455
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,941
Sure.

456
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,641
Looks pretty good
so far.

457
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,358
Still can't hear it
that well.

458
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,098
Can you hear it now?

459
00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:42,339
John?

460
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:45,680
John!

461
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:48,487
John, can you hear me?

462
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:56,534
Still no...relief?

463
00:21:56,534 --> 00:21:59,793
I got relief.
Just got no pee.

464
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,218
If the pills didn't work,
you may need a catheter.

465
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:05,226
You didn't come here
to talk to me about my pee.

466
00:22:05,226 --> 00:22:06,437
What's going on?

467
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:09,341
He's got cancer,
all right.

468
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:11,593
But it's not
in his salivary glands.

469
00:22:11,593 --> 00:22:12,680
It's in his brain.

470
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:14,881
And it's bad.

471
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:18,052
At least six tumors,
maybe more.

472
00:22:19,186 --> 00:22:21,296
He lost his hearing.

473
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:23,141
His sight's
probably next.

474
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,111
Death is probably next.

475
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:29,823
No way he could have

476
00:22:29,823 --> 00:22:31,029
grown all these in a week.

477
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:32,012
They can't be older.

478
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:33,570
The VA couldn't
have missed all these.

479
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,286
Maybe they didn't miss them,
just mixed 'em up.

480
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:38,811
Switched his films with
another patient's by mistake.

481
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:39,824
Maybe.

482
00:22:40,977 --> 00:22:42,804
But it means some poor sap's

483
00:22:42,804 --> 00:22:44,928
getting his melon sliced
at the VA for no reason.

484
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,671
And this poor sergeant's
gonna be dead

485
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:47,580
by the end of the week.

486
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:50,308
Where have you two been?

487
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:50,913
Lunch.

488
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:52,357
Why, what happened?

489
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,036
Wilson's found
some fast-growing,

490
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:57,110
elusive, or magic
brain tumors.

491
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,347
What'd you find?

492
00:22:58,347 --> 00:23:01,042
Nothing.
He's telling the truth.

493
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:02,293
About what?

494
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:03,419
About everything.

495
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,232
Where he's lived,
who he's dated.

496
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:08,204
Besides forgetting to mention
his dad's shin splits,

497
00:23:08,204 --> 00:23:09,447
his granddad's nose bleeds

498
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:11,174
and to return
a few rented DVDs,

499
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:12,682
everything he's told us
has checked out.

500
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,281
You have them
researching your dream?

501
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:18,068
No. I have them
researching my patient.

502
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:20,042
You had a dream
about a patient?

503
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:23,207
This poor guy's brain
is riddled with tumors,

504
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:24,947
and you're checking
his credit report?

505
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:30,365
Come on.
I need you guys.

506
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:32,055
Where are you going?

507
00:23:32,836 --> 00:23:33,578
To do my job.

508
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,865
He's not your patient.

509
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:37,613
He is now.
Go home and go to sleep.

510
00:23:37,613 --> 00:23:40,056
Maybe you'll dream the cure
to late-stage brain cancer.

511
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:50,410
How is he?

512
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:52,402
He's dead.

513
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,724
Oh...God.

514
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,394
At least, he will be
in a few days.

515
00:23:58,413 --> 00:23:59,586
The question is why?

516
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:03,341
The only explanation is that
the VA hospital screwed up.

517
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,187
There was definitely
no mix-up.

518
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:06,171
I hathem recheck.

519
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:07,080
Yes.

520
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,309
Why would
a government agency

521
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:11,144
lie to cover up a mistake

522
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:13,287
that might have ht hed
the death of a guy

523
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,194
they'd been trying to kill
for the last two years anyway?

524
00:24:15,194 --> 00:24:16,063
They didn't lie.

525
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,657
Did you just take
two Vicodin?

526
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:22,229
No. It was an antidepressant.

527
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:23,761
I was told to take two

528
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:24,839
every time
you walked into the room.

529
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,233
The VA scan
of his brain.

530
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:31,245
No tumors.

531
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:35,240
Yes, this is proof positive
that someone

532
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,983
didn't have tumors
in their brain.

533
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:39,349
You see that bright spot
below his left orbit?

534
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:40,954
That is a titanium pin

535
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:42,922
your patient had inserted 
20 years ago.

536
00:24:42,922 --> 00:24:45,237
Unless you think the VA
happened to

537
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:47,649
mix up his scans with someone
who had the exact same pin,

538
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:49,160
they didn't screw up.

539
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,171
You paged us?

540
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:59,324
Why didn't you send his urine
to Leicester like I told you?

541
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:01,242
Because
you told me not to.

542
00:25:02,441 --> 00:25:04,021
Why did you choose that moment
to listen to me?

543
00:25:04,021 --> 00:25:06,601
You think depleted uranium

544
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:07,800
might have something to do
with his tumors?

545
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,939
Radiation's the only thing

546
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:10,123
GIat would make
tumors grow that fast.

547
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:11,655
High doses of radiation.

548
00:25:11,655 --> 00:25:14,384
Even if he ate depleted uranium
bullets for breakfast,

549
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:15,999
he still would have been
exposed to less radiation

550
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:17,241
than we've given him
in the last two days.

551
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:18,197
Do it anyway.

552
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:20,785
And you,
call his uncle back.

553
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,312
Find out if he ever
brought his nephew

554
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:25,277
to any hospital parties
or fundraisers.

555
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:27,605
No. Not until
you give me a reason.

556
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:30,380
Because...I'm your boss.

557
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,502
A rational reason.

558
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:33,147
Or at least admit
that you don't have one.

559
00:25:33,147 --> 00:25:35,876
I've got a full bladder,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

560
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:38,504
But you are, apparently,
afraid of discoverinscthing

561
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:39,965
you can't rationally
explain.

562
00:25:39,965 --> 00:25:40,603
Shut up!

563
00:25:41,995 --> 00:25:43,148
Do what you're told.

564
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:47,276
Cuddy and Wilson may not have
to listen to me, but you do.

565
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:54,694
What the hell
was that all about?

566
00:25:54,694 --> 00:25:55,668
I don't care.

567
00:25:55,668 --> 00:25:57,220
Which is why I didn't
feel the need

568
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,663
to ask him
eight personal questions.

569
00:25:58,663 --> 00:26:00,076
I'm over him.

570
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:04,538
Just making
an observation.

571
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:10,315
All right, ready
whenever you are.

572
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:11,424
I'm ready.

573
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:15,931
Wait a minute.

574
00:26:15,931 --> 00:26:17,243
Zoom in.

575
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,499
I don't see it.

576
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:22,667
You sure you got
the right coordinates?

577
00:26:23,903 --> 00:26:25,499
Yeah, she's in
the right place.

578
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:30,194
Go 10 millimeters above
the AC-PC line on the Z access.

579
00:26:30,194 --> 00:26:32,086
Ten mil above AC-PC on Z.

580
00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:36,386
It's not there anymore.

581
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,048
Are you sure you got
the gantry angle right?

582
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:39,012
Yeah, I'm sure.

583
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:40,715
It's not there.

584
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:44,610
It disappeared.

585
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,917
Six tumors
don't just disappear.

586
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,570
Unless they were never
there to begin with.

587
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,649
The VA didn't screw up.

588
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:51,958
Maybe someone else did.

589
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,993
Maybe it was
Dr. Self-Righteous.

590
00:26:53,993 --> 00:26:56,878
I saw the tumors.
There was no mix-up.

591
00:26:56,878 --> 00:26:57,384
Maybe there's
something wrong

592
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:58,917
with the portable imager
in the O.R.

593
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,427
Something that would cause it

594
00:27:00,427 --> 00:27:01,808
to show brain tissue
in perfect detail

595
00:27:01,808 --> 00:27:03,477
but completely miss
neoplastic tissue?

596
00:27:04,662 --> 00:27:06,722
Then they were never tumors
to begin with.

597
00:27:06,722 --> 00:27:08,086
I told you, I saw--

598
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:09,995
I know, you saw something
that looked like tumors.

599
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,721
We all did.
We were all wrong.

600
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:13,659
Well, maybe
he doesn't have cancer.

601
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:14,935
Maybe he has a brain infection

602
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:16,291
that's causing
multiple abscesses.

603
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,664
That miraculously healed.

604
00:27:17,664 --> 00:27:19,871
No, they were healed by the
antibiotics we're giving him

605
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,218
for the vaginosis
in his mouth.

606
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:23,551
If it's an infection, why didn't
it show up in his blood work?

607
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:26,470
I don't know. Yet.

608
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:29,052
Dr. Wilson,
we have a problem.

609
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:31,117
What did you do?!

610
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,289
I can't feel my legs!

611
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:34,611
I can't feel
my legs!

612
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,771
What'd you guys do?
John.

613
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:37,487
John, calm down.
We didn't even operate.

614
00:27:37,487 --> 00:27:38,805
Could it be a residual
effect of--

615
00:27:38,805 --> 00:27:39,954
I can't move my legs!

616
00:27:39,954 --> 00:27:40,935
It's not the anesthesia.

617
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:44,052
John, John, we're gonna figure
out what's wrong with you.

618
00:27:44,052 --> 00:27:45,681
First we need to know
one thing--

619
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:50,068
Have you ever appeared
in any pornos?

620
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:55,144
Chronic fatigue.
Sore throats.

621
00:27:55,144 --> 00:27:57,015
Rashes.
Putrid discharge in the mouth.

622
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:58,755
Multiple abscesses
in the brain.

623
00:27:58,755 --> 00:27:59,677
Hearing loss.

624
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,867
And last, but not least,

625
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:02,768
lower limb paralysis.

626
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:05,230
He's certainly given us
plenty of clues.

627
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,833
It's gotta be
some sort of infection.

628
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:09,971
That's miraculously
improving in his brain

629
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:11,565
but getting worse
in his ears and legs?

630
00:28:12,264 --> 00:28:13,853
Could be an infection
and cancer.

631
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:17,181
Neoplastic Syndrome
could depress his immune system

632
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:18,356
and cause the other symptoms.

633
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:18,842
Mm-hmm.

634
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:19,802
You're basing this theory

635
00:28:19,802 --> 00:28:20,882
on the negative biopsy,

636
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,574
the lymph nodes
that aren't swollen,

637
00:28:22,574 --> 00:28:25,067
or the tumors that were
never there to begin with?

638
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:26,031
And what are you

639
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:28,173
gonna base your theory on--
his favorite restaurants?

640
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:30,255
I was right.

641
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:32,540
He's excreting depleted
uranium in his urine.

642
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,781
We should start him
on an IV infusion

643
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:37,267
of isotonic sodium
bicarbonate.

644
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:38,418
It's not depleted uranium.

645
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:39,704
You're the one--

646
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:41,092
Who asked for the test
when we were thinking cancer.

647
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:41,862
We no longer are.

648
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:44,572
Depleted uranium doesn't
just cause cells to mutate.

649
00:28:44,572 --> 00:28:45,708
It can cause cell death
as well.

650
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:46,807
Not spinal cord cells.

651
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:49,547
At least, not until the dose
is high enough

652
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:51,142
to kill all his other
cells first.

653
00:28:51,142 --> 00:28:52,791
So you're sayinghe radioactive
uranium in his urine

654
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:53,896
is irrelevant.

655
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,098
The sun's radioactive.

656
00:28:57,098 --> 00:28:58,368
The earth
is radioactive.

657
00:28:58,368 --> 00:28:59,783
This hospital is filled
with radiation.

658
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:01,991
The issue is not
where it is

659
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:02,934
but how much there is

660
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:04,840
and what damage
that amount could cause

661
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,228
in someone's spinal cord.

662
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:08,815
And as I already
stated quite clearly--

663
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:10,330
Got it.
We're all idiots.

664
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,264
What's your theory?

665
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:12,876
Gimme your keys.

666
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,792
Why?

667
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:15,471
You ever tried
riding a motorcycle

668
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:16,720
with a distended bladder?

669
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:20,802
Keep him on
antibiotics.

670
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,137
Check his hearing
and paralysis every hour.

671
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,773
So you basically
want us to do nothing.

672
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:27,201
No, I basically
wanna do nothing.

673
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:28,701
I want you to keep him
on antibiotics

674
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:31,137
and check his hearing
and paralysis every hour.

675
00:29:32,634 --> 00:29:33,895
Wait, you can't
go home now.

676
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:35,860
Actually,
I have to go home now.

677
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,258
It's two days
past my bedtime.

678
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:40,193
House, he needs your help.

679
00:29:40,193 --> 00:29:41,395
And I need sleep.

680
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:43,394
Hey, it's the brain's way

681
00:29:43,394 --> 00:29:44,982
of working out problems

682
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:47,293
that the conscious mind can't
solve during the day, remember?

683
00:30:00,187 --> 00:30:02,572
No. Nothing.

684
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,503
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

685
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:15,115
No, we're not.

686
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,799
We should start treatment
for the uranium toxicity

687
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,462
like you said.

688
00:30:18,462 --> 00:30:19,714
But House--
Isn't here.

689
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,600
If House wanted to be
involved in the case--

690
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,586
If he wanted us to start
this treatment,

691
00:30:30,586 --> 00:30:32,255
he would have told us to do it
the last time you brought it up.

692
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:34,250
You have a better idea?
No.

693
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,087
Then we're going
with Chase's.

694
00:32:23,957 --> 00:32:25,619
Tell him not to get
the lines tangled.

695
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:27,136
The infusion is slow.

696
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,412
We can't have
any kinks in the line.

697
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:29,888
I went to medical school too.

698
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:37,495
Keep your arms on your body,
above your heart.

699
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,318
I can't feel mt stomach!

700
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:47,057
I don't feel that.

701
00:32:48,108 --> 00:32:49,457
I don't feel anything!

702
00:32:49,457 --> 00:32:50,997
Paralysis is ascending.

703
00:32:50,997 --> 00:32:52,958
If it keeps going, we're gonna
need a respirator.

704
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,123
What?
What are you saying?

705
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:55,153
Can you breathe?

706
00:32:57,873 --> 00:32:59,992
No.

707
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:02,296
Not yet.

708
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,151
--accident on the Garden
State Parkway southbound

709
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:53,100
at exit 91...
So, where were we?

710
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:55,547
You have
a nice night?

711
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:56,450
No.

712
00:33:58,264 --> 00:34:00,338
The paralysis
is ascending.

713
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,879
The last check, it was
nearly to his diaphragm.

714
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:04,050
Tells us something.

715
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,172
Means it's getting worse.

716
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:06,586
Worse is something.

717
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,630
Also tells us
it's not the uranium.

718
00:34:09,941 --> 00:34:12,047
Did we think it was?

719
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:14,901
We started him
on sodium bicarb

720
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:16,595
to try to flush the uranium
out of his system.

721
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:19,105
Great. Now the fact that he's
getting worse tells us nothing.

722
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:21,094
Never thought it was
uranium.

723
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:23,882
For all we know, the uranium
treatment is what's making him--

724
00:34:23,882 --> 00:34:26,039
A sodium bicarb infusion
wouldn't have any effect on--

725
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:26,613
On what?

726
00:34:27,306 --> 00:34:29,248
Kind of hard to say what
it wouldn't have an effect on

727
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,637
if you've no idea
what's there to affect.

728
00:34:30,637 --> 00:34:31,792
We had to do
something.

729
00:34:31,792 --> 00:34:32,588
Well, next time...

730
00:34:32,588 --> 00:34:34,423
go with something
that has a chance of working.

731
00:34:34,423 --> 00:34:35,492
Like what?

732
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:37,584
You come up with
some brilliant idea

733
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:39,237
while you're warm and cozy
in your bed at home?

734
00:34:39,237 --> 00:34:40,289
We need more information.

735
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,534
How much more information
could you possibly want?

736
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:44,691
We have a medical history
going all the way back

737
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:45,930
to his great-grandparents.

738
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,854
A non-medical history going--
It's not enough.

739
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:50,265
It's all
we're gonna get.

740
00:34:53,744 --> 00:34:54,622
Wanna bet?

741
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,144
Who approved
a sodium bicarb infusion?

742
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,323
Don't look at me.
I was home in bed.

743
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:06,180
What's wrong?

744
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,546
He's unconscious.

745
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:09,141
His skin has lost
all color,

746
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,115
and his BP and hematocrit
are plunging.

747
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:12,376
He was only on
the sodium bicarb--

748
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,296
He's bleeding out.
He can't be bleeding out.

749
00:35:14,296 --> 00:35:15,254
There's no blood
in the bed.

750
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:16,649
Fine, he's bleeding in.

751
00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:18,474
There's no sign of bruising
or internal hemorrhaging.

752
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:19,933
Paralysis must have
reached his diaphragm.

753
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:21,660
He's not able
to oxygenate his blood.

754
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,368
He's not able to oxygenate
his blood

755
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:24,636
because he doesn't
have any left.

756
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:25,827
There's no evidence--

757
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:27,274
It's the only thing
that would explain--

758
00:35:27,274 --> 00:35:28,464
There's no reason
for blood loss.

759
00:35:28,464 --> 00:35:29,604
There has to be a reason.

760
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:32,068
He needs a transfusion.
Get me 4 units of O negative.

761
00:35:32,068 --> 00:35:34,096
Stat!
Let's elevate his feet.

762
00:35:35,015 --> 00:35:36,495
He doesn't need
a transfusion.

763
00:35:36,495 --> 00:35:38,395
Nobody asked you.

764
00:35:38,395 --> 00:35:40,296
In fact,
why are you even here?

765
00:35:40,296 --> 00:35:42,085
Because, obviously,
you need my help.

766
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:42,982
Get out.

767
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:45,596
House, his blood
obviously didn't

768
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:46,252
just vanish into--

769
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:49,654
What the hell is this?

770
00:35:50,923 --> 00:35:52,646
Somebody must have spilled
something.

771
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:54,571
Somebody else should be
getting me 4 units...

772
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,275
What the hell is that?

773
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,581
It's a urine catheter
collection bag

774
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:05,137
with a rip in it--
what the hell does it look like?

775
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:11,631
What?

776
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,203
It's just urine.
It's sterile.

777
00:36:17,535 --> 00:36:18,748
No one's getting me blood.

778
00:36:18,748 --> 00:36:20,531
Why isn't anybody
getting me blood?

779
00:36:20,531 --> 00:36:21,566
You're bleeding.

780
00:36:23,124 --> 00:36:25,274
House, are you all right?

781
00:36:28,893 --> 00:36:30,394
Why are you even here?

782
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:33,443
I'm always here.

783
00:36:35,455 --> 00:36:36,389
No, you're not.

784
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:38,993
There's a reason.

785
00:36:38,993 --> 00:36:40,432
There has to be.

786
00:37:14,617 --> 00:37:16,321
--incident on
the Garden State Parkway...

787
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:16,835
So.

788
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,070
Where were we?

789
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:20,667
You have a nice night?

790
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:22,614
Yes, I did, thank you.

791
00:37:22,614 --> 00:37:24,459
I'm guessing
better than our tient,

792
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:27,381
probably due to his BP
and hematocrit plunging.

793
00:37:28,628 --> 00:37:29,250
How'd you know?

794
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:41,291
The answer was staring
right at us the whole time,

795
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,512
as plain as the nose
on our faces.

796
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,277
Or the nose
on his face.

797
00:37:45,277 --> 00:37:47,449
What's going on?
What'd he say?

798
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:49,712
No hairs,
and cauterization scars.

799
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:51,604
Which means?

800
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,441
He had it cauterized.

801
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:55,772
How could you know that?

802
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:57,274
Just makes sense.

803
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:59,061
Undoubtedly done to stop

804
00:37:59,061 --> 00:38:00,710
the same childhood
nosebleeds

805
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,873
that plagued
his grandfather.

806
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:03,947
Undoubtedly, because
they were both born

807
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:06,313
with Hereditary Hemorrhagic
Telangiectasia.

808
00:38:06,313 --> 00:38:07,268
What's he saying?

809
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:09,052
I'm saying you've got
a genetic disease

810
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:10,655
that's destroying
your capillaries.

811
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,899
That no one in his family's

812
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:13,303
ever been diagnosed
with before?

813
00:38:13,303 --> 00:38:15,835
Not surprising, since the most
common initial symptoms--

814
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,195
skin rashes and nose bleeds--

815
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,575
are often written off
as the result

816
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:20,683
or minor trauma
or dry weather.

817
00:38:20,683 --> 00:38:22,224
But they can also be
the result

818
00:38:22,224 --> 00:38:24,481
of his arteries and veins
merging together.

819
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:26,283
He obviously has AVMs.

820
00:38:26,283 --> 00:38:28,081
<i>AVM near the spine
caused the paralysis.</i>

821
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:31,311
AVM in his lungs prevented
his blood from being filtered.

822
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,219
Dirty blood
caused the joint pain,

823
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:35,932
fatigue, and the infections
in his mouth and brain.

824
00:38:35,932 --> 00:38:38,411
Nothing that a few surgeries
won't clear up.

825
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:41,181
Get MR angiograms
of the aforementioned.

826
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:43,395
The Marines
weren't hiding anything.g.

827
00:38:43,395 --> 00:38:44,032
He was.

828
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,788
Or at least
he forgot to mention

829
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:47,378
his bloody tissue issue.

830
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:52,073
What's going on?
What'd he say?

831
00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:59,334
Oh, looks like
solving the case

832
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:00,539
solved your other problem.

833
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:02,057
There is no medicine
like happiness.

834
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:04,001
Except maybe laughter.

835
00:39:04,807 --> 00:39:07,318
Or rubber tubes
shoved up your urethra.

836
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:09,715
You cathed yourself?

837
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,201
It's actually not that bad

838
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:13,253
after the first, I don't know,
nine or ten inches.

839
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,175
Cath relieved the spasm.
I'm as good as new.

840
00:39:16,175 --> 00:39:17,616
Of course.

841
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:19,668
Just a minor spasm
in a muscle you've been using

842
00:39:19,668 --> 00:39:22,146
multiple times a day
without any problem

843
00:39:22,146 --> 00:39:23,366
for the past 45 years.

844
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,603
Not a major side effect
caused by the over-use

845
00:39:26,603 --> 00:39:29,071
of a particular narcotic
pain killer.

846
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:30,605
Yeah, that was
my thought too.

847
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:31,674
So...

848
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:35,356
no reason to think about
cutting back on your use

849
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:36,633
of that particular pill.

850
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:37,502
Thank God.

851
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:40,052
Actually, it was a triple
dose of the good stuff

852
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:41,802
that allowed me
to finally get some sleep

853
00:39:41,802 --> 00:39:42,936
and solve the case.

854
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:46,150
Pills made all my dreams
come true.

855
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,941
You really got the answer
in your sleep?

856
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:50,464
Got one in my sleep.

857
00:39:50,464 --> 00:39:52,252
The other one
I got in the shower.

858
00:39:59,806 --> 00:40:00,717
I've been thinking
about you.

859
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:03,759
You lied.

860
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,019
I didn't lie.

861
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:09,781
I simply chose not to share
completely irrelevant facts.

862
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:11,364
Like the fact
that you lied.

863
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:14,175
No wonder I couldn't
place his face.

864
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:17,721
You were practically swallowing
it on the dance floor.

865
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:18,646
I was not.

866
00:40:18,646 --> 00:40:20,020
Talk about the cool uncle.

867
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,073
He donates the money, and
the nephew gets the write-off.

868
00:40:24,103 --> 00:40:25,141
And, of course,
by write-off,

869
00:40:25,141 --> 00:40:26,817
I mean he gets to put
your ankles--

870
00:40:26,817 --> 00:40:28,629
This is exactly
why I didn't mention

871
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:30,401
our one date
over two years ago.

872
00:40:32,134 --> 00:40:32,860
Because of my T-shirt.

873
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:36,160
Because you are
an obnoxious ass.

874
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,571
Because you would have
spent the whole time--

875
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:39,583
That's very smart.

876
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,175
'Cause this way,
I spent my whole time

877
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:42,714
completely focused
on the patient.

878
00:40:42,714 --> 00:40:44,807
How did you even
remember him?

879
00:40:44,807 --> 00:40:46,364
We were only at that party
for, like, ten minutes.

880
00:40:46,364 --> 00:40:47,866
Is this some new
health plan?

881
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:49,609
You service
the Dean of Medicine,

882
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:50,982
and you get free health care
for a year?

883
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:54,654
Why are you smiling?

884
00:40:55,392 --> 00:40:58,349
You remembered him
because he made out with me.

885
00:41:00,673 --> 00:41:01,267
I'm good with faces.

886
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:03,934
So, this plan,
is it open to anyone?

887
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:04,970
Is there a co-pay?

888
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,200
You're lousy with faces.

889
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,971
Don't make this
about me.

890
00:41:07,971 --> 00:41:09,030
This is your humiliation.

891
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:11,548
So how much for
private room coverage?

892
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:13,711
Get over me.

893
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:17,306
Gimme a break.
You hired me--

894
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:18,388
'Cause you're a good doctor

895
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:19,908
who couldn't get himself hired
at a blood bank,

896
00:41:19,908 --> 00:41:21,003
so I got you cheap.

897
00:41:21,003 --> 00:41:23,270
You gave me everything
I asked for,

898
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,289
because one night I gave you
everything you--

899
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:28,179
Stop staring at my ass
when you think I'm not looking,

900
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:31,027
showing up at restaurants
where I happen to be on a date,

901
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:33,393
and fantasizing about me
in the shower.

902
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:35,923
That ship sailed
long ago, House.

903
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:37,996
Get over it.

904
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:41,875
If you're still
referring to your ass,

905
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,961
I think
"that super-tanker sailed"

906
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:45,604
would be the more
precise metaphor.

907
00:42:20,143 --> 00:42:21,137
Sorry.

908
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:23,247
I was looking
for an extra-large trash can.

909
00:42:30,832 --> 00:42:32,205
Since when does he
clean anything up?

910
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:53,987
