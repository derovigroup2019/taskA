1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,960
I can't do this button.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,490
Oh, you almost got it.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,110
Almost got it.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,380
The sound...

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,240
of the people talking.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,200
Hmm?

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,970
- It's a flat.
- Is it? Well.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,200
Look how smart you are, huh?

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,770
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,930
Thank you.

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,560
I am proud to introduce my son to you, Patrick Obyedkov.

12
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,010
25 years ago, patrick was in the fourth grade.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,980
A good student, played little league.

14
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,650
And then there was the accident.

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,380
And here we are...

16
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,750
Raising money for people with similar neurological disabilities.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,710
I hope you enjoy the concert.

18
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,110
Are you all set?

19
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,030
All set.

20
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,750
He's never missed a note.

21
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,740
Something's wrong.

22
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,530
Patrick, what is it?

23
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,290
My hand, it hurts.

24
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,050
Let me see it.

25
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,950
Oh, papa!

26
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,900
<font color=#FFFF00>House M.D.
Season 3 Episode 15 "Half Wit"</font>

27
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,280
"Good Morning, Read now. XO Yoyo Mama.

28
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,100
What's the emergency?

29
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,480
35-year-old savant, dystonia in his left hand.

30
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,060
He paged us at 5:00 in the morning for that?

31
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,360
I'm going back to bed. Dystonia's not life-threatening.

32
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,160
Clonazepam will take care of it.

33
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,890
He's already on clonazepam.

34
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,220
For seizures he has from a bus accident when he was ten.

35
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,460
Then we treat with benztropine.

36
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,320
What's up?

37
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,900
35-year-old savant, dystonia.

38
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,190
I'm going back to bed.

39
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,390
Where are you going?

40
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,580
Bathroom. It can wait.

41
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,160
There is no case, House.

42
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,210
Even if dystonia was some big medical mystery,

43
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,260
it's not this time.

44
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,910
You're not intrigued as to how a perfectly healthy

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,340
ten-year-old boy with no prior musical training

46
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,530
gets into an accident on his way to school,

47
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,570
can suddenly play the piano?

48
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,520
Do we have to solve a 25-year-old case before breakfast?

49
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,330
You two shower together?

50
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,990
No! Double negative, it's a yes.

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,680
Savantism is just one of those things.

52
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,820
It's inexplicable.

53
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,970
Just because it's inexplicited, doesn't mean it's inexplicable.

54
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,110
I want new labs.

55
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,980
CBC with platelets, CH panel, thyroid and adrenal function tests.

56
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,940
For what?

57
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,650
I don't know.

58
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Raise your left hand.

59
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,810
That's your right hand.

60
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
What are you looking for?

61
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,950
Just wanna make sure whatever happened doesn't happen again.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,650
Push up. Push up.

63
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,040
He repeats what people say.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,700
It's a compensation mechanism.

65
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,990
He knows he's supposed to say something,

66
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,480
so he repeats what he just heard.

67
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,100
That's good, shows he's engaged.

68
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,490
Spine's okay.

69
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,540
All right.

70
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,060
Now stick out your tongue like this, copy me.

71
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,230
You have a big tongue.

72
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,090
I know, it's funny, but copy me.

73
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,750
There was construction on Radcliff.

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,220
So I had to get out of the car and, and walk in high heels for over a mile.

75
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,490
Radcliff?

76
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,300
What was the cross street?

77
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,300
Does it matter?

78
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,780
I don't know, I'm not the one who brought it up.

79
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,640
Tie this off.

80
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,070
Nice and tight.

81
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,150
Does this have anything to do with my foot?

82
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,820
You have a blister.

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,350
You don't waste a doctor's time with a blister.

84
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,040
You waste a doctor's time with more important things.

85
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,710
Like the sewer that's being vented out of your mouth.

86
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,220
My breath?

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,460
If you could stop doing that, we'd all be grateful.

88
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,850
I can't stop breathing.

89
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,190
- No, but you could stop puking.
- I don't--

90
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,800
Your lips say, "no," your gnarly fingers say, "blegh!"

91
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,990
It's good to go.

92
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,650
It's a shame.

93
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,940
You do look cute that thin.

94
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,270
Motor cortex looks good.

95
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Everything checks out.

96
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,420
What tests did you run?

97
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,350
Full battery of neurological--

98
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,450
I need this blood checked for cholesterol and glucose levels.

99
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,300
Patient had a foot problem.

100
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,590
Different patient.

101
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,880
There was no one else in there.

102
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,080
You're using the wrong equipment.

103
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,480
Dr. Foreman, I thought we were being discharged.

104
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,100
I'm Dr. House.

105
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,780
On the off chance that Dr. Foreman didn't mention it,

106
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,900
I have something of a gift too.

107
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,250
Come on.

108
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,790
- Your turn.
- My turn.

109
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,520
Does this have anythingto do with his hand?

110
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,280
It might. Okay, Patrick, close your eyes.

111
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,610
What's this?

112
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,780
- D, g flat, a flat, b, c-
- Yeah, all right, all right.

113
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,870
He's good.

114
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,190
Can we let him go?

115
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,720
He's great.

116
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,480
He's staying.

117
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,340
Call radiology.

118
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,590
I need a functional MRI of his brain.

119
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,790
FMRI's not gonna show trauma.

120
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,740
I'm not looking for trauma.

121
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,560
I wanna see the music.

122
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,230
See the music.

123
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,660
Well, that's dull.

124
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,920
You think FMRI's gonna show a big arrow

125
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,970
pointing to a flashing sign saying "savantism"?

126
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,500
Would be hugely helpful.

127
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Somehow, he's been rewired as a music specialist.

128
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,560
I wanna know how that happens.

129
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,460
He has access to parts of the brain that you don't.

130
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,370
His brain's doing nothing.

131
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,280
It looks like any jerk listening.

132
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,000
He's not a savant at listening.

133
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,140
He's a savant at playing.

134
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,090
Well, listening and playing are two different neurological processes.

135
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,510
Turn off the music.

136
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,790
Patrick, I want you to pretend that your leg is a piano.

137
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,790
My leg's not a piano.

138
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,550
I know, that's why I said "pretend".

139
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,880
The kid's a moron.

140
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,600
Keep your head still, use your fingers.

141
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,580
Wow. Cool, huh?

142
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,390
His heart rate rose.

143
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,580
Emotional response?

144
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,850
Then why is there no activity in the limbic system?

145
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,130
Unless there's a problem with his heart.

146
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,610
Do an echo to confirm.

147
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,400
- Then scrub up.
- He's gonna need surgery.

148
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,400
Wasn't dystonia.

149
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,250
He's got a heart condition that caused the arteries in his arm to constrict.

150
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,250
Do you have any idea why House would want to go to Boston?

151
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,830
The chowder?

152
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,780
Plane tickets, this Friday.

153
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,570
I opened his mail.

154
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,710
I heard there's an opening at Harvard for division chief, infectious disease.

155
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,660
Well, ambition's not one of his more prominent traits.

156
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,180
- Although...
- what?

157
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,440
Well, he was testing blood in the clinic.

158
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,390
Don't think it was a patient's blood.

159
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,730
Why, it was green?

160
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,010
No, he was checking for routine stuff.

161
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,960
Makes sense if he's lookingfor basic medical clearance for employment.

162
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,240
I'm going home.

163
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,240
No, you're not.

164
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,240
He could show up any minute.

165
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,740
Not with a savant to obsess about.

166
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,640
I'll take in here.

167
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,690
Bedroom's down the hall.

168
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,740
You've been here?

169
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,260
Where else would the bedroom be?

170
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,310
Come with?

171
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,300
You're scared of him catching us breaking into his home,

172
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,490
but you're not scared of him catching us doing it in his bed?

173
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,780
If I'm gonna get fired anyway...

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,780
almost at the heart.

175
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,690
No bleeding.

176
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,600
And...done.

177
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,710
Heart rate's 160, it's accelerating.

178
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,610
He's at 210.

179
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,140
He's in supraventricular tachycardia.

180
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,600
Paddles!

181
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,740
Charging.

182
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,310
Clear!

183
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,640
We're wasting our time!

184
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,020
His high school yearbook.

185
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,550
Unless you think he's going to Boston to attend a high school reunion,

186
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,500
put it back and let's get out of here before he comes home.

187
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,080
He's not smiling.

188
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,940
I wonder if he has teeth.

189
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,290
What's the area code for Boston?

190
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,130
617, why?

191
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,470
Massachusetts general. May I help you?

192
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,860
Did you think you could steal Dr. House without a fight?

193
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,240
Steal him for what?

194
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,250
Quit jerking me around, I know he's coming out there.

195
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,390
We're not looking to hire him.

196
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
He's called you six times in the last month.

197
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,880
We're not looking to hire him.

198
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,020
You think if you keep repeating it, I'll start believing you?

199
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,000
Dr.Cuddy, there's nothing else I can say.

200
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,480
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,530
Well, if he's not coming there for a job interview,

202
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,860
he's either coming to your hospital for

203
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,580
a social visitor because he's a patient.

204
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,290
Is it a social visit, Dr.Medick?

205
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,360
I can't stand House.

206
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,740
Neither can Dr.Kupersmith.

207
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,580
What's up?

208
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,290
Do you know a Dr.Kuper Smith in Boston?

209
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,530
Yeah, he's an oncologist.

210
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,490
What's up?

211
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,960
What's his subspecialty?

212
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,920
Brain cancer.

213
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,730
What's going on?

214
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,700
He doesn't look sick.

215
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,230
He should have symptoms.

216
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,900
Blurred vision, headaches, confusion, clumsiness.

217
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,830
Depends on how far along the cancer is, what kind, how aggressive.

218
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,540
He didn't tell you.

219
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,730
House is House.

220
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,210
He's no different than anyone else with cancer.

221
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,260
Once you tell, then every conversation is about that.

222
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
Cardiac arrest means we were wrong.

223
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,210
There was a heart problem.

224
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,640
But no vasoconstriction!

225
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,550
The heart problem couldn't have caused the hand problem.

226
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,210
Unless the bleed happened suddenly.

227
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,600
Less blood to the brain explains the dystonia,

228
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,630
less blood to the heart explains the heart attack.

229
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,250
Scope him above and below.

230
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,770
If that doesn't work, gut him.

231
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,770
You can't sedate him?

232
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,060
There's a risk his throat could collapse.

233
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,400
You look mad, pop.

234
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,390
No. No, I'm not mad, I promise you.

235
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,420
It's just that, um, the doctor has to do something

236
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,330
to you and it's, and it's gonna hurt.

237
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,330
Hurt me?

238
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,480
Why hurt me?

239
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,630
Make you better.

240
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,470
What's wrong with me?

241
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,760
Well, they don't know.

242
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,850
Patrick, don't you worry, everything is gonna be great.

243
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,280
All right, here we go, Patrick.

244
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,380
You wanna hurt me.

245
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,170
Okay, open. Like this.

246
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,940
You just look at me.

247
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,320
And everythingis gonna be okay.

248
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,880
Look at me. Patrick, over here.

249
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,230
Yep, it's okay.

250
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,660
It's okay, really.

251
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,990
Dr.Wilson! Wilson!

252
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,800
I just spoke to Cuddy, she can't confirm whether

253
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,610
House is applying for a job in Boston.

254
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,200
Yeah, I'm late for a--

255
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,490
If I have to look for work,

256
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,310
I have a right to know.

257
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,900
That's pretty.

258
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,990
I wrote this when I was in junior high school.

259
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,370
I could never figure out what came next.

260
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,980
Then dimwit came up with this.

261
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,210
It's good.

262
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,030
It's perfect.

263
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,500
I could set up a tower on the roof during a lightning storm.

264
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,070
Help you switch brains with your patient.

265
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,040
Then you would be the brilliant pianist

266
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,940
and he would be the doctor hiding brain cancer from his friend.

267
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,080
It's nothing.

268
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,460
You need to talka bout it.

269
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,450
You need to talka bout it.

270
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,880
At least let me look at your medical file.

271
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,270
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

272
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,320
Who else knows?

273
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,320
No one.

274
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,520
And cancer isn't nothing.

275
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,890
Sorry, didn't mean to offend your specialty.

276
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,180
Why didn't you come to me?

277
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,050
Stein's good.

278
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,480
Stein's in Africa for the next six months.

279
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,190
He's given meat least six months.

280
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,620
I'll go to Boston, I'll get the treatment.

281
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,680
Everything'll be fine.

282
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,450
No need to talka bout it.

283
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,020
You're right, surgeon found a bleed behind the kidney

284
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,440
in the retroperitoneal cavity, but no reason for it.

285
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,110
No cancer, no ruptured arteries...

286
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,070
so bleeding explains the symptoms,

287
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,500
but we've got no explanation for the bleeding.

288
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,650
And while they were closing him up,

289
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,170
Patrick had a grand mal seizure,

290
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,050
which makes no sense, since he's on an anti-convulsant medication.

291
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,240
You told him.

292
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,100
No, I didn't.

293
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,500
I...only told Cameron.

294
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,440
Okay. You guys have cleverly deduced that I have cancer.

295
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,640
You have no right to know.

296
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,970
You have no business knowing.

297
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,370
We'd like to run some blood tests.

298
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,990
As soon as you work up our patient, who is not me!

299
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,990
We just want to make sure you weren't misdiagnosed.

300
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,640
I wasn't, let's move on.

301
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,690
We're just asking for a couple of vials.

302
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,280
- No!
- Why not?

303
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,610
Okay, we're going to proceed as if I'm perfectly healthy.

304
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,470
How can we do that if we know you're not?

305
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,630
You don't know anything!

306
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,060
Except, hopefully, how a patient on

307
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,540
anti-convulsant medication has a seizure.

308
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,730
Anti-seizure meds don't prevent seizures,

309
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,980
they just make them manageable.

310
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,430
According to the surgeon's report,

311
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,050
this one wasn't even close to manageable.

312
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,380
Means the question isn't why is he having seizures,

313
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,890
it's why are his seizures getting worse?

314
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,270
What's changed?

315
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,420
His brain, it's gotten worse.

316
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,520
So we make it even worser.

317
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,150
We take him off anti-convulsant medication.

318
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,390
He'll seize even more.

319
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,490
Multiple seizures can seriously damage a brain.

320
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,200
Dude can't button his shirt.

321
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,950
How much more damaged we really talking about?

322
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,670
Stronger seizures will light up different parts of

323
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,050
the brain which will indicate which parts are damaged.

324
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,580
Once he gets worse, do a PET scan.

325
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,880
PET scan done?

326
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,450
No. You come for my feelings?

327
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,590
'Cause I left them in my other pants.

328
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,080
This is a letter of recommendation.

329
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,130
I'm applying for a job at Penn.

330
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,890
Thank you for writing your own.

331
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,090
I'm sure my thoughts are beautifully phrased.

332
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,160
Thank you for signing it.

333
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,490
Saves me having to fake your signature.

334
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,900
Stay away from weiss.

335
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,010
He cries with his patients.

336
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,680
Holds their hands as they die.

337
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,590
He won't like you.

338
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,350
Your new found nonchalance in the face of cancer.

339
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,100
I thought you'd find it appealing.

340
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,960
20 seconds.

341
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,110
Pretty good.

342
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,970
For what?

343
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,210
Time it took you to go from hard-ass to human being.

344
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,110
You really wanna leave?

345
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,970
If you're not here, there's not much point in staying.

346
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,870
I'm not dead yet.

347
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,030
What are you doing?

348
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,220
I know this must be a turn-on for you.

349
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,540
Little whorishto kiss and stab.

350
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,830
You kissed back.

351
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,350
I didn't want you to die without knowing the feeling.

352
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,000
Actually, no woman should die without knowing the feeling.

353
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,010
All we need is a few drops of your blood.

354
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,830
Foreman and Chase's lips are not gonna get

355
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,020
so close now that I know your plan.

356
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,110
There's a nurse downstairs about to risk his job

357
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,780
to steal the blood you drew from yourself yes--

358
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,270
I'm patient number 020406.

359
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,130
In the record room under the name Luke N.Laura.

360
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,560
There's a whole vial of blood there.

361
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,560
Along with CT scans, MRIs, CSF--everything you need.

362
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,360
If you need a sperm sample, come back without the needle.

363
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,750
Six centimeter mass in his dorsal midbrain,

364
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,940
extending into the temporal lobe.

365
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,800
That's inoperable.

366
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,040
What kind of time does he have?

367
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,990
He's got a year.

368
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,930
Nurse! Nurse!

369
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,590
There's a consent from Boston for the cancer drug trial.

370
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,970
Any description of the process of previous trials?

371
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,070
Yep. Any chance it'd work?

372
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,650
No. It's not even designed to work.

373
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,450
Why would he--

374
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,540
It's designed to treat depression in terminal cancer patients.

375
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,220
He doesn't seem depressed.

376
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,050
Okay, let's assume that I am dying.

377
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,460
Which I specifically told you not to assume.

378
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,030
Could we at least assume that'm not dying tomorrow?

379
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,650
Whereas this kid, PET revealed several more hot spots,

380
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,800
but they're non-specific.

381
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,610
How can you focus on him?

382
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,780
It's the only way I can cope.

383
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,830
Pet also showed a left brain that's working hard.

384
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,740
Harder than the right?

385
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,510
Wouldn't be worth mentioning otherwise.

386
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,400
Bleeding in the brain.

387
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,980
Blood would irritate the lining, might cause the seizures to get worse.

388
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,500
Yes, he needs an angiogram to look at the vasculature inside his brain.

389
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,810
We'll get right on it, as soon as we're finished here.

390
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,130
Don't get up. I got it.

391
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,040
You're busy. Continue.

392
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,700
You know what my team is doing right now?

393
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,340
No.

394
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,390
They're trying to figure out what's wrong with me.

395
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,540
What's wrong with you?

396
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,110
Thanks for asking.

397
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,840
They found out that I'm dying.

398
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,370
That's sad.

399
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,280
Everyone's dying.

400
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,140
That's sad.

401
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,810
Meteor lands on my head tomorrow, it's all academic.

402
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,760
I told them to leave me alone, but did they?

403
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,100
D-did they?

404
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,910
No, that one was rhetorical.

405
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh. No, they did not.

406
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,850
What the hell were you before you hit your head?

407
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,570
Hell is a bad word.

408
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,470
So's ass and bitch.

409
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,440
I could probably rattle off 50 much more complicated and disgusting ones,

410
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,730
but then your dad would get pissed at me.

411
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,450
Do you like your life?

412
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,310
What life?

413
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,170
Your life.

414
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,360
Playing the piano, going on tour.

415
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,510
Scoring girls left and right.

416
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,180
I don't like girls.

417
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,370
Boys. Whatever gets you off.

418
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,510
I like the piano.

419
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,820
What's wrong?

420
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,630
Dr.Peter Hayes?

421
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,870
This is Eric Foreman at Princeton Plainsboro.

422
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,730
You're doing a signal transduction inhibitor clinical trial.

423
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,210
What kind of results have you been--

424
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,920
Transduction inhibitors are a decade away.

425
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,920
Bye, Pete!

426
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,490
They've got another trial going on at Duke.

427
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,630
15% extend their lives beyond five years.

428
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,920
If you're positive for protein phf--

429
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,690
stop trying to save me.

430
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,590
I'm fine.

431
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,340
MRA confirms small collections of blood

432
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,100
throughout the white matter of Patrick's right hemisphere.

433
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,810
Mind if we chat about that for a few moments?

434
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,520
Either trauma, an aneurysm, cancer, or autoimmune disease.

435
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,530
We need a biopsy to figure out which it is.

436
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,900
His eeg was non-specific.

437
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,950
Where are you gonna biopsy?

438
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,950
Everywhere.

439
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,190
Sure, just put on a blindfold and play piano in the tail on the brain.

440
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,150
He's bleeding into his brain.

441
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,110
He's dying.

442
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,770
You can't just randomly stab the temporal lobe

443
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,300
and hope you hit the right spot.

444
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,160
Well, I'm only gonna take little tiny pieces.

445
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:29,960
Until what?

446
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,220
Till I find the problem.

447
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,230
Or you kill him.

448
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,850
No, I'll keep going even if I kill him.

449
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,320
Then he's screwed.

450
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,370
Thanks for the chat.

451
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,220
What if we do the EEG from inside his brain?

452
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,650
I'm actually a little insulted.

453
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,130
You were supposed to spend the last hour worrying about me.

454
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,420
It's risky and invasive.

455
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,610
But that's why god invented the long consent form.

456
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,310
Can you get to why this is a brilliant idea?

457
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,640
External EEG could get confused if there are multiple structural abnormalities.

458
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,590
If we perform the EEG inside the skull, it could show us where to biopsy.

459
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,170
Brilliant.

460
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,070
Go. Do.

461
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,550
I'd also like to talk to you about--

462
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,750
This is gonna be personal, isn't it?

463
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,420
Yeah.

464
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,730
We use a small drill to get inside the skull.

465
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,770
There's bleeding inside?

466
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,250
Yes.

467
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,690
As long as we have 12 holes,

468
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,340
we can surgically implant the electrodes

469
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,480
under the meninges against the brain.

470
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,650
And it's either cancer or autoimmune disease?

471
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,580
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

472
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,200
Which one is better?

473
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,050
Neither.

474
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,010
Hey. Where do we cut?

475
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,580
We don't.

476
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,730
I need to say something.

477
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,890
- Something personal.
- Yeah.

478
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,320
And I can't leave because you've got something interesting in that file.

479
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,180
Sorry.

480
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,790
You're an arrogant ass who makes it impossible for anyone to like him,

481
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,560
by punishing people who don't deserve--

482
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,840
Can get to the "but" part of this speech?

483
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,750
But I like you.

484
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,990
No, you don't.

485
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,780
You're just reacting to the perception of my death.

486
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,350
You need to put things in order.

487
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,250
- Fear of guilt-
- Would you shut up?

488
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
See? I annoy you.

489
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,770
Now are you gonna give me the results, or are you gonna...

490
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,380
Intracranial EEG showed no electrical abnormalities.

491
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,580
Which means it's autoimmune.

492
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:38,960
No, it also showed his entire right hemisphere is brain dead.

493
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,630
So...while you guys were worrying about me,

494
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,010
half this kid's brain died.

495
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,550
The only solace you should take from this is the fact that it didn't.

496
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,670
Garden variety EEG sucks compared to the in-brain variety,

497
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,200
but it's not gonna miss brain death.

498
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,200
He's gotten worse.

499
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,210
Not that much worse.

500
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,520
Respiration is depressed, seizures are increasing,

501
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,670
one every five minutes.

502
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,030
It's not that much worse.

503
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,750
He can still talk,and he's left-handed,

504
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,430
which means speech is in the right side.

505
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,840
You don't know how Patrick's brain reorganized itself 25 years ago.

506
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,930
What if the right side is just a little dead.

507
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,650
Maybe he still has random neurons firing.

508
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,750
You're just looking for a puzzle to distract you from your own situation.

509
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,490
You're right. He's dead. Let's go home.

510
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,440
What'd you find out?

511
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,580
It's going to be ok?

512
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,700
- I'm sor-
- Yes!

513
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,310
What's this?

514
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,460
Piano.

515
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,540
What's this?

516
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,060
He's obviously lost use--

517
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,110
Shut up.

518
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,790
Music is a global process.

519
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,180
Can't play the piano with half a brain.

520
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,220
What's it mean?

521
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,750
It means the right side of his brain has always sucked.

522
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,180
It means it's not relevant to what's going on now.

523
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,610
Wow, then it's autoimmune.

524
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,140
Yeah. Question is, what do we do about it?

525
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,480
Most likely ones we can fix.

526
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,970
Polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu, or sarcoid.

527
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,680
I'll start treatment.

528
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,930
Not what I was talking about, but yeah.

529
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,450
You do that.

530
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,200
Your turn?

531
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,630
Do you have to do that?

532
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,890
You mean cheapen everyone's attempt at a human moment

533
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,030
by identifying the real calculations that go into it?

534
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,950
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

535
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,620
I'm sorry you're dying.

536
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,480
I'm gonna hug you.

537
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,100
Anything to say?

538
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,020
Well, if you're considering grabbing my ass, don't start anything...

539
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,170
You can't finish.

540
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,600
Well, as long as we're just standing here, do you mind if we work?

541
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,730
How's the kid's treatment going?

542
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,110
Are you crying?

543
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,440
No. Respiration rate's up.

544
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,690
Seizures are calming down. It's all good.

545
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,310
Not for what I'm gonna do next.

546
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,030
But there is no next.

547
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,100
He's gonna be fine.

548
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,490
Only if he wants to remain a four-year-old who wets his bed.

549
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,150
There's nothing else for him.

550
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,110
There's better.

551
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,780
Thanks for the hug.

552
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,890
It's the middle of the night.

553
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,510
You knew I'd be asleep.

554
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,750
Phone would've woken you up just as much.

555
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,110
And I can't see what you're wearing on the phone.

556
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:20,490
My patient with the 55 IQ has Takayasu syndrome.

557
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,630
Very uncommon.

558
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,970
Happens mostlyin Asian women.

559
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,640
Takayasu is manageable with steroids, which you already know.

560
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,640
So I assume you're here for something else.

561
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,790
My patient also has significant seizure problems.

562
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,360
Also manageable with anti-convulsant medication.

563
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,940
Yes, and if he kept takinghis anti-convulsant medication,

564
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,800
he could go back on tour and play the piano.

565
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:46,370
But...a hemispherectomy would completely

566
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,400
stop the right brain seizure activity

567
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,310
and he would no longer need to take his anti-convulsant medication.

568
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,010
You wanna remove half his brain.

569
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,020
The right half, it would be irresponsible to remove the left.

570
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,590
You don't remove half a brainand gain function.

571
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,210
Not my brain.

572
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,560
But his? Who knows?

573
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,810
Look, let's say that I'm the left side of Patrick's brain.

574
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,050
I'm quick-witted, I'm charming, I'm great looking.

575
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,430
You're the right side of his brain.

576
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,670
You're useless, old, damaged.

577
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,110
We go to a bar for a drink.

578
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,800
Now, I have the mad skills to be scoring all the hot babes,

579
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,510
but instead I'm spending my time wiping drool off your chin

580
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,420
and making sure you don't eat the table cloth.

581
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,420
What's the father wanna do?

582
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,280
I don't know.

583
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,280
So go wake him up.

584
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,320
House. I'm so sorry.

585
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,630
Forgot I was dying, huh?

586
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,630
I'm here if you need me.

587
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,390
I need you.

588
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,550
One small feel for man.

589
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,790
One giant ass for mankind.

590
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,970
Thanks.

591
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,450
Good luck in Boston.

592
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,460
Call the make a wish foundation.

593
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,490
Dr.Foreman was just here.

594
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,640
Seizures have most completely gone away.

595
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,640
Says we might be able to go home in the next day or two.

596
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,640
Thank you so much.

597
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,540
I think we should remove the right side of your son's brain.

598
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,640
I thought you fixed him.

599
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,070
Does he look fixed?

600
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,420
Right side of his brain was keeping him walking straight.

601
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,540
Other than that, it's been dead weight ever since the accident.

602
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,880
If we remove it, seizures would stop completely.

603
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,310
But the seizures are hardly noticeable.

604
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,550
They don't bother Patrick.

605
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,760
But without the seizures,

606
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,280
the left side would have a chance to actually function.

607
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,640
It could learn to do new things.

608
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,930
Only bummer...he'd never play the piano again.

609
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,410
No, the piano is everything.

610
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,610
I'm not saying he'd ever work for NASA,

611
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,770
but flipping burgers isn't out of the question.

612
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,430
Well, I don't mind taking care of him so he can play the piano.

613
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,720
No, you're actually lucky.

614
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,340
You don't have to watch your kid grow up.

615
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,920
You don't have to let go.

616
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,010
You trying to make this about me?

617
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,970
I love my son!

618
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,400
Just the way he is.

619
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,550
He's a monkey grinder at the circus.

620
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,770
- He's worked hard to get where he-
- So does the monkey.

621
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,000
The piano is a neurological accident.

622
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,020
He has a gift.

623
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,930
I'm offering him a life.

624
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,350
It's up to you.

625
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,140
I've isolated the cancer proteins in House's csf.

626
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,100
'Bout time.

627
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,100
We can't let him goto Boston if he qualifies for the Duke trial.

628
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,820
You wanna do it?

629
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,080
Damn.

630
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,140
He's negative for protein phf.

631
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,110
He doesn't qualify.

632
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,290
What's that?

633
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,210
That shouldn't be there.

634
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,540
Patrick.

635
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,390
Hello, papa.

636
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,720
Patrick, I have a question for you.

637
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,700
Yes?

638
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,240
Are you happy?

639
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,700
Are you happy?

640
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,110
House, open up!

641
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,300
Open up, it's important!

642
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,720
I've got a flight in three hours.

643
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,580
You don't have cancer.

644
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,390
There was abnormal presence of IGG and IGM indicating--

645
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,920
I don't have neurosyphilis. My MRI showed nothing-

646
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:49,830
It's a gumma in your brain.

647
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,170
It's very rare not to be in the liver,

648
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,030
and I'm really glad we never slept together--

649
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,650
You would've used a condom.

650
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,750
And I don't have syphilis.

651
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,610
- My VDRL was negative-
- we did an FTA antibody test,

652
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,430
the VDRL was a false negative.

653
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,720
You're not going to die!

654
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,290
All you need is iv antibiotics!

655
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,050
Did you send these results to mass general?

656
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,110
- Of course.
- You idiots.

657
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,210
We just told you you're not gonna die.

658
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,260
You should be making out with Cameron.

659
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,550
You knew it wasn't cancer?

660
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,170
I was sure it was cancer.

661
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,170
Then why aren't you celebrating?

662
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,320
Because it wasn't my damn file!

663
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,310
You faked cancer?

664
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,980
The real patient is in the Wither spoon wing.

665
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,370
Feel free to tell his wife that he's not gonna die,

666
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,760
but he is cheating on her.

667
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,240
Why would you want us to think that you--

668
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,530
I didn't!

669
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,100
I wanted the guys in Boston to think that I had cancer.

670
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,820
I wanted the guys who were gonna implant a cool drug right

671
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,390
into the pleasure center of my brain to think that I had cancer.

672
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,460
You faked cancer to get high?

673
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm going to bed.

674
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,130
You're right.

675
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,310
I don't like you.

676
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,550
Sure, now that I'm not dying.

677
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,190
I heard Patrick's hemispherectomy went well.

678
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,460
He survived the surgery.

679
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,710
He's unconscious.

680
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,490
How depressed are you?

681
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,210
I'm not depressed.

682
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,490
You faked cancer.

683
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,350
It was an outpatient procedure.

684
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,450
I was curious.

685
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,310
Are you curious about heroin?

686
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,400
Not since last year's Christmas party.

687
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,070
I know this goes against your nature, but can we not make too much of this?

688
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,980
You made people think that you were going to die.

689
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,220
I didn't make them!

690
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,660
I tried to hide it.

691
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,560
But you idiots needed to get into my business.

692
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,890
I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why are you laughing?

693
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,660
It's ironic.

694
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,690
I'm sure I'll regret asking,but why--

695
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,400
Depression in cancer patients is not as common as you think.

696
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,400
It's not the dying that gets to people.

697
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,790
It's the dying alone.

698
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,320
The patients with family, with friends, they tend to do okay.

699
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,700
You don't have cancer.

700
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,330
You do have people who give a damn.

701
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,950
So what do you do?

702
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:42,500
You fake the cancer, then push the people who care away.

703
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,450
Because they're boring.

704
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,310
Go home to your hotel room and laugh at that irony.

705
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,540
Start small, House.

706
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,070
Take a chance.

707
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,620
Maybe something that doesn't involve sticking stuff in your brain.

708
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,340
Pizza with a friend.

709
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,650
A movie.

710
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,510
Something.

711
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,580
Follow my finger.

712
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,100
Do you know your name?

713
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,140
His speech center was on the right side.

714
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,250
It'll be a while before he's talking.

715
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:44,580
He hasn't really done anything except to stare off into the distance.

716
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,960
He'll take some time to...

717
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,730
