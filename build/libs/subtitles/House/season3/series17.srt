1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,410
Hey

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,060
You got this all thing wrong

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,860
just rock star's supposed to be late

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,520
not the rock star photographer

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,830
sorry,it's morning sickness, touch the belly

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,970
It's first time I am being asked

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,620
come on, it's good luck

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,110
Hit the kinos behind the drop.

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,050
So what do you think?

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,810
Uh,I think people aren't gonna get it.

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,960
Oh,come on.

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,110
All-american rejects.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,970
Juxtaposing a classic image of americana
with modern pop culture,you.

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,300
Oh,yeah,
everyone loves a good juxtaposition.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,510
My fans were born in the '90s.

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,910
You know what? You do this picture,
you'll gain 40 years fans.

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,860
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,280
Love the rockwell thing.

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,260
I thought so.

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,710
Okay,kill the house lights,
let's go.

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,640
Hang on.

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,300
Hey,who's in charge of the backdrop?

23
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,460
- Naomi?
- Yeah?

24
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,070
What's wrong with it?

25
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,620
Well,the words are completely jumbled.

26
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,570
What?

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,720
- You can read that?
- Of course.

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,220
You okay?

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,950
No.Oh,god.

30
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,120
I--I could be having a--a--
what's--what's the mnemonic?

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,680
Uh...F...f is for face.

32
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,630
Is my smile crooked?

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,670
What are you doing?

34
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,910
A...a is for arms.Arms...

35
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,470
You should really sit down.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,670
Can somebody get her some water?

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,150
S is...s is speech.

38
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm slurring...

39
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,820
I'm slurring? Huh?

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,240
oh,f-a-s-T.

41
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,520
T is time.

42
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,220
Hurry,somebody,uh...

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,100
call 911,
tell them I'm having a stroke!

47
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,370
Hi,I'm dr. House.

48
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,390
My boss says you're important.

49
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,290
Personally, I don't get what's so hard
about making scarlett johansson look pretty.

50
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,040
Arms out in front of you.

51
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,440
Your palms up,
like you're holding a pizza.

52
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,160
Close your eyes.

53
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,800
It's so easy,
you should consider a career change.

54
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,500
Probably make a lot more money.

55
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,310
Dr. Mackman tell you the clot was clear?

56
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,420
Yes.

57
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,760
And he said that you and the fetus are fine.

58
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,790
Yeah.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,510
He didn't mention your pronator drift.

60
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,050
What's that mean?

61
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,460
It means mackman is an idiot.

62
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,930
May I?

63
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,120
Yeah.

64
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,490
So.

65
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,730
You take thousands of photos of someone,

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,880
but only one has to look good.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,480
Kind a the opposite of my business.

68
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,840
It's not about looking good.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,050
People are always hiding things.

70
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,420
I just keep shooting until
I can see what's really inside them.

71
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,320
My eyes okay?

72
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,870
Eyes are gorgeous.

73
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,050
Vessels don't look so hot.

74
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,930
Micro aneurysms predict further strokes.

75
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,970
This is gonna happen again?

76
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,790
Unless I can figure out
the underlying cause.

77
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,440
Puff up your cheeks.

78
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,990
You should be able to
keep the air in.

79
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,670
It means there's weakness
around the mouth.

80
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,650
So where'd you learn
to self-diagnose a stroke?

81
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,350
Oh,my,uh,baby's biological father
is a neurologist.

82
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,180
He once told me the fast mnemonic
could save my life one day,so...

83
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,760
interesting pet name.

84
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,170
Most people go with
"husband" or "pookie" .

85
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,670
He's gay.

86
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,740
Just a sperm donor.

87
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,900
So when you--

88
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,370
you turned him for a night?

89
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,400
Just straight for one date?

90
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,070
Okay.

91
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,560
He took a magazine
and a cup into my bathroom.

92
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,100
Man after my own heart.

93
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,890
Different magazine,obviously.

94
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,020
I'm rescinding mackman's discharge order.

95
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,390
My lackeys will be in to do some tests,
take some more blood,

96
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,330
and empty your catheter bag.

97
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,030
Not a moment you'll want to cherish.

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,210
This is definitely different.

99
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,630
it looks almost like...

100
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,630
he's caring.

101
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,650
Find anything else
in the patient's folder?

102
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,690
Like a diagnosis?

103
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,080
Urinalysis revealed excessive protein
and red blood cells.

104
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,280
Chem panel showed a creatinine level
over 2.5,so.

105
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,490
First she strokes,now her kidneys
are shutting down--why?

106
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,380
Ultrasound showed
no tumors or stones,

107
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,190
no signs of fetal distress,
no urinary tract obstructions.

108
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,930
Bp is fine,no preeclampsia.

109
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,410
Any of you guys
ever been to the galapagos?

110
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,740
Was our patient there?

111
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,510
Dengue fever,avian pox,even west nile.

112
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,780
No,I'm looking for a vacation spot.

113
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,080
That mean we get vacation?

114
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,680
How would that differ from
your current status?

115
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,160
you're gonna do what,relax?

116
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,410
Visiting family.

117
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,880
My uncle's a giant turtle.

118
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,930
What if the kidney failure came first?

119
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,400
Kidneys could've caused the stroke,
not the other way around.

120
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,660
Kidneys don't often get stuck
in the brain.

121
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,090
I'm saying it threw a clot.

122
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,120
Early symptoms of kidney failure
are nausea, vomiting,ankle swelling.

123
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,810
She could've mistaken it
for morning sickness.

124
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,150
Heart's way more likely to
throw a clot than the kidney.

125
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,280
Echo was normal.

126
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,330
History indicates no sign
of cardiac problems.

127
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,610
No,but if one were to read
the history closely,

128
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,000
one would notice that
she had six cases of strep.

129
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,050
in her throat. That's the one
about ten inches above the heart.

130
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,840
Let me rephrase.

131
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,900
Six cases of untreated strep.

132
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,480
She was prescribed antibiotics.

133
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,580
No one takes them all.

134
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,920
They stop when they start feeling better.

135
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,860
All strep is untreated strep.

136
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,490
What happens when strep goes untreated?

137
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,750
It leads to rheumatic fever.

138
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,220
Which leads to...cameron?

139
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,490
Mitral valve stenosis.

140
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,620
Which is a thickening
in the valve of the...kidney?

141
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,050
No. Kidney doesn't have a mitral valve.

142
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,010
We'll go look at the heart.

143
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,780
It'll be easy to find.

144
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,330
It's the big red pumping thing about
ten inches below her throat.

145
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,820
That was weird.

146
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,340
He was the way he always is.

147
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,540
Which is weird.

148
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,580
Very still,emma.

149
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,720
- Sorry.
- No problem.

150
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,460
He caught us with your hand up my shirt.

151
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,890
He's gotta have a reaction to that.

152
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,650
You think that's what the vacation is?

153
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,990
Yes. The pain of losing you
is obviously forcing him away.

154
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,530
coronal slice appears normal.

155
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,720
There's no way house
just lets this slide.

156
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,250
He's gotta be planning something.

157
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,520
Maybe he just doesn't give a crap.

158
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,950
Sagittal slice is clean.

159
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,540
You think he just stumbled
into that closet?

160
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,900
He knew we were there,
and he wanted us to know that he knew.

161
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,550
Or you wanted him to know,
now he does,

162
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,970
and you're annoyed
because he doesn't care.

163
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,490
Right there.

164
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,970
Transaxial slice,
calcified mitral valve.

165
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,310
Barely.
That's n big enough to throw a clot.

166
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,720
Obviously it is,because it did.

167
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,230
House was right.

168
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,470
A valve in your heart is narrowed.

169
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,920
It caused the clot
which led to your stroke,

170
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,700
and the reduced circulation
caused the problems with your kidneys.

171
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,650
And this'll fix it?

172
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,550
The balloon will force the valve back open.

173
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,960
And you'll be fine.

174
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,800
can I do this without a sedative?

175
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,710
It's very mild,
there really is no risk to the fetus.

176
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,380
we'll monitor
your baby's heart rate separately.

177
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,120
We won't allow it to decrease
anywhere near dangerous levels.

178
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,930
Thank you.

179
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,480
You're both gonna be fine.

180
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,720
Go ahead,dr. Cameron.

181
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,110
Listen to that heartbeat.

182
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,830
It sounds so...

183
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,990
start threading the catheter.

184
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,070
No,I don't want a layover in frankfurt,
taipei,singapore,or london,ontario.

185
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,770
That's why I asked for a direct flight
to phnom penh.

186
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,560
How hard is it to not land?

187
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,240
Does it matter what I answer?

188
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,940
Then fine,I'd be delighted to hold.
What's new?

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,650
Can you tell cuddy to stop interfering?

190
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,840
It's her job. What's new?

191
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,570
Good news is emma's heart is fixed.

192
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,730
Bad news is it's not her underlying problem.

193
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,760
Her kidney'sare still failing.

194
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,880
you're vacationing in cambodia?

195
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,440
You gonna unwind in the killing fields?

196
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,000
Nope,gonna catch me a fish this big.

197
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,560
Mekong giant catfish,
weighs over 600 pounds.

198
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,000
Aren't those catfish critically endangered?

199
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,970
That's why it's my last chance
to catch one.

200
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,450
All of our operators are...

201
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,070
if the mitral valve had been properly fixed,

202
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,140
the kidney should be getting better.

203
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,780
Which leads us to the conclusion
that you screwed up the procedure.

204
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,590
Or you screwed up the diagnosis.

205
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,210
The mitral valve thickening
was so insignificant,

206
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,540
it probably wasn't the cause
of the kidneys or the stroke.

207
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,740
Probably never would've been a problem.

208
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,490
She needs dialysis,
and we need a new theory.

209
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,470
there are only a few possibilities.

210
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,660
Patient's pregnant,
could be preeclampsia.

211
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,930
We eliminated it before--

212
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,580
check for proteinuria and low platelets--
whaelse?

213
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,030
Hypoperfusion,the fetusis basically
a parasite stealing nutrients,minerals,blood.

214
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,050
Put her on telemetry.

215
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,530
or the pregnancy's irrelevant.

216
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,460
Could be infection,sepsis,hus/ttp.

217
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,530
a cholesterol embolism is just as likely.

218
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,990
Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down
and clog up the small vessels in the kidneys.

219
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,200
Get a smear and ultrasound her vessels for plaque.

220
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,890
That's it,has to be one of those five.

221
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,140
You know what would be even better?

222
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,370
If we could narrow it all the way down to one.

223
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,480
Thank you for holding.

224
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,890
We are experiencing extremely high call volume.

225
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,440
Thank you for your patience.

226
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,740
She's 0 for 5.

227
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,850
Either the differential was wrong,

228
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
or she's faking it.

229
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,520
Kidney failure has to be precipitated--

230
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,350
by one of the five we've already ruled out.

231
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,850
The body only has so many ways
of screwing with the kidneys.

232
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,720
The labs must be wrong.

233
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,160
We did the labs.No one else had access.

234
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,090
That's not quite true.

235
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,950
You put all your patients through this
many tests,or just the important ones?

236
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,310
We wanted to explore all the possibilities.

237
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,330
And?

238
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,020
We've eliminated all the possibilities.

239
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,220
You telling me I'm dying
and you have no idea why?

240
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,370
Your body is functioning properly.

241
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,770
So why my kidney is failing

242
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,880
the other body isn'T.

243
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,200
There's something wrong with the fetus.

244
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,700
welcome to the world
of maternal mirror syndrome.

245
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,540
Mom's body is like
an intricate german metro system.

246
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,410
All the trains run on time.

247
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,800
When she gets pregnant,
it's like a new station opening in dusseldorf.

248
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,490
Bunch of rookies running things,
bound to be mistakes.

249
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,750
Kids play on the tracks,
get electrocuted.

250
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,040
Before you know it,
trains are backed up all the way to berlin,

251
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,670
and you got a bunch of
angry germans with nowhere to go.

252
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,490
And we all know that ain't good
for the jews.

253
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,850
Who are the jews in this metaphor?

254
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,860
A few things can happen
to a fetus in distress.

255
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,150
It can become a miscarriage,
still birth,very sick baby,

256
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,760
or,on rare occasion, a time bomb
that kills mom while it's dying.

257
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,850
Good news is,we fix the fetus,
mom gets better.

258
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,130
It's the diagnostic equivalent
of a two-for-one sale.

259
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,370
I've read the outcome of mirror syndrome
is almost always unfavorable.

260
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,950
Unfavorable...
is that doctor speak for dead baby?

261
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,310
You think she'll be less upset
if you phrase it nicely?

262
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,440
we can tell her the truth,
that she'll be fine

263
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,290
as soon as we diagnose a person
who weighs about one pound.

264
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,940
Can't touch it, can't ask where it hurts,
can't see it.

265
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,030
If only there existed giant machines
that could look through human skin.

266
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,750
Mirror syndrome has a limited number
of known causes.

267
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,760
Tachyarrhythmia,fetal anemia,
placental chorioangioma--

268
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,540
all of which are fixable.

269
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,400
Which would be un-unfavorable,right?

270
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,610
Could also be trisomy 13,
ebstein's anomaly,

271
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,130
an aneurysm of galen's vein--

272
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,460
then dr. Storm cloud rained
all over the differential

273
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,880
and killed the beautiful little baby.

274
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,930
Heart's easiest to see,easiest to fix,
so let's start tre.

275
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,680
When you did mom's mri,
did you get a look at the fetus' heart?

276
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,320
It was in the range,but blurry.

277
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,230
The fetus was moving all over the place.

278
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,410
So we need another scan.

279
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,740
Yeah,we'll just ask the fetus to lie very,
very still.

280
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,790
No need.

281
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,630
I'm going to paralyze it.

282
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,710
You want to paralyze emma sloan's baby?

283
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,910
Let me guess.Cameron?

284
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,090
Cameron and chase both had their concerns.

285
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,660
No,cameron had concerns.

286
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,850
Chase just agreed with her

287
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,710
because  he didn't want to lose
his all-access pass to her love rug.

288
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,230
They're sleeping together?

289
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,750
If by sleeping together you mean
having sex in the janitor's closet.

290
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,940
Here?

291
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,460
No,the janitor's closet at
the local high school.

292
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,150
Go,tigercats!

293
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,780
Do you have one of those camera phones?

294
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,290
'Cause I got a my space account.

295
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,590
I will deal with them
after I deal with you.

296
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,300
Oh,come on,let's gossip some more.

297
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,870
I'm sure she's into bondage.

298
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,290
Paralyzing a one-pound baby risks damaging--

299
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,910
not paralyzing the thing risks
not getting a clean mri of its heart.

300
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,980
Which we need to save its life,

301
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,150
which we need to do to save emma's life.

302
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,330
You're gonna need to get her consent.

303
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,870
That shouldn't be too hard.

304
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,550
Sign here or you and your baby both die.

305
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,340
I'm going with you.

306
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,050
Oh,good.

307
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,580
You said sedation was risky.
This sounds insane.

308
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,590
The injection goes into the umbilical cord.

309
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,450
The baby won't feel a thing.

310
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,850
Fetus.

311
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,490
I'm lowering expectations.

312
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,520
It works here and on dates.

313
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,270
The benefits outweigh the risks,

314
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,110
and the paralytic will
wear off in an hour,okay?

315
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,450
Must be easier to hear you might die
than your baby might die.

316
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,720
But if there's anyone
I would trust to save my baby,

317
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,860
it would be dr. House.

318
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,170
Fetus.

319
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,300
Hold this.

320
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,250
Dr. Cameron. The mri results back?

321
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,970
The fetus' heart is structurally sound.

322
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,080
The problem's with the bladder.
It's four times normal size.

323
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,180
Let me see.

324
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,690
Bladder's so engorged,it's taking up
the whole torso, squeezing all the other organs.

325
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,300
There's no room for the lungs to develop.

326
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,030
The baby has a lower urinary tract obstruction.

327
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,900
We can fix that by inserting a shunt.

328
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,690
I'll give emma the news.

329
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,040
Are you...taking over the case?

330
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,220
House won't care.

331
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,880
He has his diagnosis.

332
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,420
Dr. Cameron.

333
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,910
Dating chase...

334
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,860
can only end in one of two ways.

335
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,750
House told you?

336
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,150
You get married and live happily ever after,

337
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,090
or somebody gets hurt
and you two can't work together,

338
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,410
and I have to fire somebody.

339
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,770
I would hate to see my personal life
become such a burden to you.

340
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,300
I'm telling you this for your own good.

341
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,890
Well,I assume you're gonna have this
same conversation with chase for his own good.

342
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,920
Chase isn't the one
that's gonna get hurt here.

343
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,180
There's only room for one.

344
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,510
Though I could scooch over.

345
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,670
My social life is my social life.

346
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,040
Couldn't agree more.

347
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,610
What goes on in the privacy of a janitor's
closet is nobody's business except??

348
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,370
she told me to end it.
Is that what you want?

349
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,260
I was actually hoping
she'd fire one of you.

350
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,280
What are you doing?

351
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,070
Trying to avoid altitude sickness.

352
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,730
Couldn't score a direct flight to cambodia,

353
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,340
so I've decided to scale argentina's
infamous mount aconcagua.

354
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,250
Perfect,except for the fact that you can't walk.

355
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,400
There's a tribe of mocovi indians
who actually carry the elders??

356
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,870
you're insane.

357
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,820
I'm an insane genius.

358
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,990
Set the chamber to low pressure
instead of high.

359
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,970
Thinner air builds upextra red blood cells,
creates new capillaries.

360
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,060
Few more days in here,
I can save myself six weeks in base camp.

361
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,580
Where's my mri?

362
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,670
There's a blockage in the urinary tract.

363
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,840
Simple terms,your baby can't pee.

364
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,490
His bladder is swollen
and it's crushing his lungs.

365
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,810
Well,can you fix it?

366
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,410
We can insert a small tube in the baby's bladder

367
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,410
that makes the urine come out straight through
his belly for the duration of the pregnancy.

368
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,000
The bladder decompresses,

369
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,900
and the lungs will be able to develop normally.

370
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,060
When the baby gets better,you should get better.

371
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,480
First we just have to do a test to determine

372
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,760
whether the baby's kidneys
are functioning properly.

373
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,440
A-and what if they're not?

374
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,850
If they're already too damaged,

375
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,190
then there's really nothing we can do.

376
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,550
If this doesn't work out,
you can always try again.

377
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,170
I miscarried twice when I was married.

378
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,600
After the divorce,I tried in vitro,
like,four times before this.

379
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,270
I'm 42.

380
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,000
Maybe it's,uh,just not meant to be.

381
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,660
What are you doing?

382
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,640
Well,you're trying to be me,
so I thought I'd try to be you.

383
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,100
You don't have the cleavage for it.

384
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,900
But I havea much tighter ass.

385
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,820
You think every day
should be naked thursday,

386
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,550
or is that an oxymoron?

387
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,970
Let me see the results of the bladder tap.

388
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,390
They aren't back yet.

389
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,230
They're gonna be inconclusive.

390
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,920
You think my diagnosisis wrong?

391
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,560
Fetus doesn't pee,
amniotic fluid should be low.

392
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,770
Mom's level is fine.

393
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,940
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

394
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,840
Could just mean we caught
the obstruction early.

395
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,730
Either way,your tests
will be inconclusive.

396
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,700
The urine you collected has been
sitting in that fetus' bladder for weeks.

397
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,420
And as my pappy always said,
"stale pee is useless pee".

398
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,100
Fine,then I'll do another tap.

399
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,580
Just as useless.

400
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,810
Old urine drops down from the kidney right
after the first tap 'cause it's all backed up.

401
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,340
Bladder tap number three
will give you the freshest pee,

402
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,380
and it's when you'll find out
if this fetus has even a fighting chance.

403
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,430
Thank you.

404
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,660
I'll run two more taps.

405
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,640
Since when does the dean of medicine
run bladder taps?

406
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,040
She's an important patient.

407
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,790
Because she takes pictures?

408
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
Or because she's you?

409
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,860
A woman in her 40s.

410
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,180
Single.

411
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,190
Using a turkey baster as
a last gasp at motherhood.

412
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,540
And you wanna make sure she succeeds,

413
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,270
so you'll still have hope.

414
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,000
Can't be a good doctor
if you're not objective.

415
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,290
It's your file.

416
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,330
I don't want it.

417
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,300
Then why did you just say all that stuff?

418
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,820
To humiliate you.

419
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,050
- You're taking the case back.
- I don't want it.

420
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,170
Your diagnosis is right.
I wanna go on vacation.

421
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,980
You can go on vacation
after you've cured her.

422
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,440
good news.

423
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,480
The fetus' urinehad appropriate levels
of protein and electrolytes,

424
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,270
so his kidneys aren't damaged.

425
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,660
We're gonna put the shunt in,

426
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,530
your baby's lungs should
have more room to grow,

427
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,280
and your symptoms should go away.

428
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,010
But he'll still need surgery
after he's born?

429
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,800
That's when we'll remove
the blockage in the ureter.

430
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,510
You'll be the only mother on the planet

431
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,210
who appreciates the value of a wet diaper.

432
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,990
Hey,could you hand me that?

433
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,260
I'm keeping a visual memory book
of this entire surreal process,

434
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,150
and this is the best part
of the story so far.

435
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,300
- Yeah,sure.
- Thanks.

436
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,770
When did you take this?

437
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,680
Oh,she did the second bladder tap.

438
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,470
You should keep it.

439
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,060
Oh,I see her all day at work,
I don't need it.

440
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,340
Maybe you wanna see her after work.

441
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,280
I'm right,right?

442
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,700
I saw the way you look at her.

443
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,200
Thanks.

444
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,810
Shunt is in the right position.

445
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,110
The bladder's starting to decompress.

446
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,450
No infection.

447
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,120
Did house say anything else?
About us?

448
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,040
I thought you didn't care
about his reaction.

449
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,890
Trying to make him jealous?

450
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,510
I like my job.

451
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,490
He can't fire you just
because we're together.

452
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,350
We're not together,
and house can do whatever he wants.

453
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,330
How's my baby?

454
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,480
Doing just fine,emma.
So are you.

455
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,250
My stomach is killing me.

456
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,600
That's not her stomach.

457
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,260
Can you open your eyes,emma?

458
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,650
I just need to take a look.

459
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,050
What is it?

460
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,520
Emma's jaundiced.

461
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,820
Her liver's shutting dowN.

462
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,080
Figures.

463
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,870
I just booked my trip
to johnston strait.

464
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,560
I thought you were climbing mount
whatever in argentina.

465
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,280
Apparently I'd have to live with
the mocovi indians for 20 years

466
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,560
before they'd consider me an elder.

467
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,040
Decided to go kayaking with orca instead.

468
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,540
- No legs required.
- Can't leave yet.

469
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,250
Liver failure puts her case back
in the unsolved pile.

470
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,690
Increased ast,alt,
and her bilirubin's off the charts.

471
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,200
Even fetuses lie.

472
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,940
We diagnosed a lower urinary tract obstruction
because we saw one.

473
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,060
What if that's not the whole story?

474
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,500
What if the little bugger is hiding something?

475
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,570
Real reason for the mirror syndrome.

476
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,160
Have we looked under its bed?

477
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Have we checked its diary?

478
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,250
If it's not gu,it could be the heart.

479
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,450
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

480
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,190
- There were no structural problems.
- Lungs.

481
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,500
We won't be able to get a good look
until they develop. It'll be weeks.

482
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,360
He's not gonna last weeks.

483
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,460
What do you wanna do?

484
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,030
Maternal mirror syndrome
has one surefire cure.

485
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,390
Deliver the fetus.

486
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,190
That's not viable at 21 weeks.
You'lll the baby.

487
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,080
Fetus.

488
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,420
Semantics make you feel better?
Pretend it's not a person?

489
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,510
Can it play catch?

490
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,470
Can it eat?

491
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,210
Can it take pretty pictures?

492
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,770
Who wants to tell her?

493
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,110
the swollen bladder
was not the only problem.

494
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,470
We can't leave it inside you.
We have to terminate.

495
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,710
Well,can't you deliver him?

496
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,880
Put him on a respiratory machine till--
till you figure out what's wrong.

497
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,010
We can.

498
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,930
It won't matter.

499
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,450
The fetus is still at least two weeks
away from being viable.

500
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,590
Oh,well,I'll suffer through this
for two more weeks,then.

501
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,840
You're on dialysis for your kidneys.

502
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,330
Your kidneys can wait.

503
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,230
They don't make dialysis for your liver.

504
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,490
You're not gonna make it two more days.

505
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,650
I'm not gonna let you kill my baby.

506
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,130
It's killing you.

507
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,610
I'm not having an abortion.

508
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,450
It's not a baby.

509
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,830
It's...a tumor.

510
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,440
I understand dying for a cause,

511
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,640
sacrificing your life
so your child might live.

512
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,490
But that's not the choice here.

513
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,670
Either it dies,or you both die.

514
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,590
Or you fix him,and we both live.

515
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,450
I can't fix it.

516
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,410
I'm scheduling a d and C.

517
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,070
I won't consent.

518
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,000
So i guess you have two days
to figure it out.

519
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,010
Her kidneys are almost irreparable.

520
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,760
She's developed severe dic.

521
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,440
You have to force her to terminate.

522
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,070
Did you give corticosteroids to
speed the baby's lung development?

523
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,540
No,I dropped an anvilon its chest
to prevent lung development.

524
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,320
I'm trying to extinguish
the human race one fetus at a time.

525
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,190
Give the lungs more time to expand
so you can see inside them,

526
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,400
see if they're the problem.

527
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,440
My real patient is dying.
Very quickly.

528
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,370
Like,I wouldn't advise her to
buy any green bananas.

529
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,360
The fetus is nothing more than
a parasite at this point.

530
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,920
Removing it is an instant cure.

531
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,480
You're not gonna get emma
to see it that way.

532
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,920
She's probably already named the baby.

533
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,990
Read him books,
had conversations with him.

534
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,110
You get it.

535
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,150
She'll listen to you.

536
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,280
No.

537
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,150
You let this woman refuse to terminate,

538
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,250
you're helping her commit suicide.

539
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,640
As her doctor,
my recommendation is against suicide.

540
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,210
If the baby had a doctor,

541
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,010
I think she would recommend exhausting
all possibilities before taking its life.

542
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,090
Then she'd be an idiot.

543
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,720
Too bad she's your boss.

544
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,770
What if our original assumption is wrong?

545
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,150
It isn'T.

546
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,030
If we assume
she doesn't have mirror syndrome,

547
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,460
then terminating her pregnancy
isn't gonna help her liver at all.

548
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,610
We eliminated all other possibilities.

549
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,080
The fetus is hydropic and in distress.

550
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,670
Emma's kidneys and liver are failing.

551
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,700
The diagnosis is solid.

552
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,300
The ass-kisser won't agree with you.

553
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,280
You must be even wronger than I thought.

554
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,180
Fine.

555
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,210
Let's assume
she had mirror syndrome,

556
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,210
but we fixed it when
we fixed the baby's bladder.

557
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,180
That means that her failing liver
would be completely unrelated.

558
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,300
If it is,we can fix it.

559
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,780
And we don't have to terminate.

560
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:21,070
So her theory is that our patient's
liver problems were just a giant coincidence.

561
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,490
It's nota surprising coincidence.

562
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,670
Pregnant women can develop liver problems.

563
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,520
If this is the case,

564
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,050
we can actually do something here.

565
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,250
Don't you guys think
that's worth exploring?

566
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,550
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
would have the same symptoms.

567
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,530
Thank you.

568
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,560
Brown-noser.

569
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,490
Viral hepatitis,hellp syndrome.

570
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,670
Oh,look,sticking up for your girlfriend.

571
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,530
Who says chivalry's dead?

572
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,100
He's not joking?

573
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,450
Be patient.

574
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,800
She's going through all of us,
she'll get that jungle fever eventually.

575
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,060
I'm not going through anyone.

576
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,470
You love him?

577
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,250
This can probably wait until
after you biopsy emma's liver,right?

578
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,370
we can't,her platelets are too low.

579
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,520
Once we pierce her liver,

580
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,120
it'll be next to impossible
to stop the bleeding.

581
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,650
Come in from above.

582
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,550
Instead of going straight
in through her abdomen,

583
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,280
go in through the veins in her neck.

584
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,090
Transjugular hepatic biopsy.

585
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,150
If the liver starts to bleed,

586
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,240
it'll bleed right back into her own veins.

587
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,380
Why don't you start your vacation now?

588
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,330
Threading the guide wire through
the right internal jugular vein.

589
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,610
So...

590
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,720
the sleep lab?

591
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,990
You and cameron not sleeping.

592
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,860
How serious is it?

593
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,800
It's nothing.

594
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,070
She's only doing it to make house jealous.

595
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,380
Then why are you doing it?

596
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,450
Are you kidding?

597
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,060
Approaching the inferior vena cava.

598
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,550
Slow down.

599
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,670
You better not hurt her.

600
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,740
- She already has a big brother.
- She does?

601
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,060
You obviously care very deeply about her.

602
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,340
I'm not protecting her,
I'm protecting myself.

603
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,280
A heartbroken,lovesick cameron...

604
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,720
would be even more unbearable
than she is now.

605
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,300
You're through the hepatic vein.

606
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,610
Firing the needle.

607
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,390
Heart rate and bp spiking.

608
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,370
Get that out of her.

609
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,880
Fetus' heart rate just dropped to 50.

610
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,110
We've got contractions.

611
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,200
Pre-term labor.

612
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,920
Start a terbutaline drip.

613
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,060
We were able to control the
pre-term labor with tocolytics.

614
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,060
The contraction shave subsided for now.

615
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,730
And the liver biopsy was negative.

616
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,120
This is definitely mirror syndrome.

617
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,320
Her baby's doing this to her.

618
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,390
We're out of options.

619
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,990
Did the biopsy cause the pre-term labor
or did it happen on its own?

620
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,940
It doesn't make a difference.

621
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,780
Pre-term labor can be a new symptom.

622
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,680
New information gives us new theories.

623
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,610
Isn't that how it works?

624
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,690
Not in this case.

625
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,790
Her body's trying to do
what you refuse to.

626
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,290
Get the baby out and save itself.

627
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,490
Patient's transaminases are
ten times normal.

628
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,490
Her liver's on the verge of
shutting down completely.

629
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,490
A torch test could--

630
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,690
we don't have time for more tests.

631
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,990
We have to terminate or she'll die.

632
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,390
Then let's work faster.

633
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,190
Medicine doesn't work faster
just because you hope real hard.

634
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,490
But it could help to see
what the baby's been hiding.

635
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,390
The only organ we haven't been
able to look inside is its lungs.

636
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,490
The problem must be in there.

637
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,690
We haven't been able to see inside
because they're under developed.

638
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,590
We've already got her on
corticosteroids,

639
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,690
- but it'll take weeks for them--
- then let's drown them in corticosteroids.

640
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,590
Multiple courses,
speed up their development.

641
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,690
Giving the baby more than one course
will suppress adrenal gland function.

642
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,190
Have long-term adverse
effects on fetal organ development.

643
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,090
- Worse than death?
- emma's already on tocolytics.

644
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,090
The combination could put
her into pulmonary edema.

645
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,590
You'll just kill her faster.

646
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,090
It's the only chance we have to
see inside those lungs.

647
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,690
We're just gonna have to make the baby
better faster than we make emma worse.

648
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,090
Come on, this is the kind of
thing house does every day!

649
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,890
House thought we should
terminate six hours ago.

650
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,890
I'll do it myself.

651
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,690
Anybody gonna stop her?

652
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,790
Stopping the madness is her job.

653
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,490
Somebody's gotta be cuddy's cuddy.

654
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,690
Nurse!

655
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,790
- Pulmonary edema?
- Who tattled?

656
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,790
Doesn't matter.

657
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,990
There's a reason we don't give
multiple courses of corticosteroids.

658
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,290
Gee, thanks.

659
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,890
It's time to terminate.

660
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,190
That's not what she wants.

661
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,390
Look at her.

662
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,490
She didn't want to be
an incubator for a dead baby,

663
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,690
but that's what you've done.

664
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,590
Either get me a laryngoscope or get out.

665
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,590
you were right.

666
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,190
You were all right.

667
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,890
Now the mom's lungs are shutting down.

668
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,790
She's dying faster than
the baby's lungs are developing.

669
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,790
I had to stop the corticosteroids.

670
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,390
Have you spoken to the family?

671
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,090
The only family she's got is that baby.

672
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,690
Well, he's biased.

673
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,790
What do you think house would do?

674
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,690
House wants to terminate.

675
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,490
I mean if he didn'T.

676
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,290
If he shared my position,
what do you think he would do?

677
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,690
He wouldn't share your pain.

678
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,590
He'd be objective.

679
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,790
Right.

680
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,090
He would prioritize his problems.

681
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,890
He'd terminate.

682
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,790
He wouldn't be afraid of
screwing with her lungs

683
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,790
if there was a bigger issue.

684
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,890
There is no bigger issue.
She needs her lungs.

685
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,290
Not right now.

686
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,190
She's already on a respirator.

687
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,390
The machine is breathing for her.

688
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,390
I can do whatever I want to her lungs.

689
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,090
If you're playing catch in the living room
and you break your mother's vase,

690
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,490
you may as well keep playing catch.

691
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,790
The vase is already broken.

692
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,590
Yeah, except that room can't
breathe without that vase.

693
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,390
I'm putting her back on corticosteroids.

694
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,590
- It worked.
- What worked?

695
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,590
I got the baby's lungs to expand.

696
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,290
- We should be able--
- cab's on its way.

697
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,790
I have to finish packing.

698
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,190
I have a whole new appreciation
for what you do.

699
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,490
How hard it is to believe
when everyone around you

700
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,790
is telling you that you're wrong.

701
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,590
Helps to know they're idiots.

702
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,690
Do you think I'm an idiot?

703
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,490
You're not objective.

704
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,190
But you're not an idiot.

705
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,290
These lungs are still two weeks
away from being viable.

706
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,090
But big enough for a diagnosis.

707
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,890
These tissue buds are new.

708
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,190
Could indicate bronchopulmonary
sequestration or diaphragmatic eventration.

709
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,890
I was thinking bronchogenetic
cyst or bronchial atresia.

710
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,090
Could be lung lesions,ccam.

711
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,090
What about--

712
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,790
move.

713
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,490
I thought you started your vacation.

714
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,890
Somebody had to save
our boss' rotundus ass.

715
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,990
Latest mri of the sloan fetus.

716
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,790
Small buds in the lungs could indicate--

717
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,890
thanks,
got that multiple choice all worked out.

718
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,190
Question is,how do we pick between
a, b, c, d and none of the above?

719
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,590
Portable mri's in her room.

720
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,690
We could get a current image--

721
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,990
fetal lungs are so tiny,
an mri won't give us the details we need.

722
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,190
What would we do if
this patient were not just a tadpole?

723
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,490
Say it was an actual person.

724
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,990
He...is a person.

725
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,790
Thanks for playing along.

726
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,390
Pretend it's a one-pound adult.

727
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,090
Forget the mom,forget the womb,
the placenta.

728
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,890
How would we get a better
look at what's in the lungs?

729
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,190
Transe sophageal echo.

730
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,690
Can't access its esophagus.

731
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,390
High-resolution ct could
give us a clearer??

732
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,790
too much radiation for a
one-pound person.

733
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,290
You can't just shoot
everything down,chase.

734
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,190
You're not me.Collaborate.

735
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,390
A ventilation perfusion scan
would be next.

736
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,490
How do we get a fetus to breathe
in a radioactive isotope?

737
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,190
Idiot.

738
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,590
If it were really a person
and we had no other options,

739
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,190
we'd do an exploratory surgery.

740
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,190
Cut into its chest and have
a look around.

741
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,390
Let's do that.

742
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,090
You're the one who insists
we treat it like a person.

743
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,490
I'll put it back when I'm done.

744
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,090
Me again.

745
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,690
Your friendly neighborhood belly-squirter.

746
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,290
We're gonna doopen fetal surgery.

747
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,490
We open the uterus,
cut out the fetus so we can look around.

748
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,690
I know you can't talk,so

749
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,890
I need you to look petrified
if you consent.

750
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,090
The umbilical cord won't be cut.

751
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,890
During surgery,

752
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,990
your body will basically serve
as the baby's heart-lung machine.

753
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,590
We find what's wrong and we fix it.

754
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,590
If we can.

755
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,090
Don't lower expectations
if you want them to do something.

756
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,390
She should know what she's facing.

757
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,690
This is incredibly dangerous.

758
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,990
It risks both your lives.

759
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,590
The only reason why we're suggesting it

760
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,190
is because there's nothing else we can do.

761
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,690
You all here for the fetal surgery?

762
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,190
We are way over capacity.

763
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,190
Mind each other's personal space.

764
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,490
There are sharp implements in the room.

765
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,890
Like this one.

766
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,190
uterus is fully exposed.

767
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,090
And we're in.

768
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,290
Start draining the amniotic fluid.

769
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,790
Have you never sucked beer
out the bottom of a keg?

770
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,290
- Where'd you go to college?
- Gimme that.

771
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,790
Affix the pulse ox to the palm.

772
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,490
House.

773
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,690
Sorry.

774
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,590
I just realized I forgot to tivo alien.

775
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,990
fetal heart rate good,
stats are stable.

776
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,190
Position him for the incision.

777
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,490
all right,
I see three well-defined lesions.

778
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,790
It's definitely ccam.

779
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,790
I should be able to resect them.

780
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,190
It's the mom.She's in v-fib.

781
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,190
Charging.

782
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,190
Clear!

783
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,190
I'm clear.

784
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,590
Looks like asystole,
paddling's not gonna do anything.

785
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,390
It's fine v-fib!I'm going again.

786
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,290
Clear!

787
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,490
We're gonna lose them both.Clamp.

788
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,490
The surgery's not doing this to her,
the fetus is.

789
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,190
Step away,house,I'm going again.

790
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,590
The only way to save her is to
cut away the anchor holding her down.

791
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,790
You keep going,
you're gonna get electrocuted.

792
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,690
clear!

793
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,090
Going again.Clear!

794
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,990
Heart rate's returning to normal.

795
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,990
Continue with the lobectomy.

796
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,490
So my kidneys,
liver,and lungs are all fine?

797
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,090
Just like that?

798
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,690
Just like that.

799
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,390
That's amazing.

800
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,390
What's amazing is how blond
your baby's hair is.

801
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,890
My baby?

802
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,790
You know,the thing in your belly
that tried to kill you.

803
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,390
You've never called him a baby before.

804
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,990
Any pain?

805
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,590
Nothing I can't deal with.

806
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,290
You can only get out of bed to pee,
poo,or shower.

807
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,090
And absolutely no sex,
so stop flirting with me.

808
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,290
Sorry.

809
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,490
So this really worked?He'll be...

810
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,290
normal?

811
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,590
if you call being born twice normal.

812
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,890
Hey, thank you.

813
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,390
Don't thank me.

814
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,290
I would a killed the kid.

815
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,990
Wanna grab a bite?

816
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,090
In a minute.

817
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,490
Emma asked me to bring up her camera.

818
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,990
I'll walk you.

819
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,390
When'd she take this picture of you?

820
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,790
You look so...

821
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,690
I'm smiling.

822
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,090
I have a nice smile.

823
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,790
No, I've never seen you like this.

824
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,290
She got you to...

825
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,990
glow.

826
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,890
What were you doing?

827
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,390
What'd she say to you?

828
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,090
I always glow.

829
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,290
House.

830
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,490
Need you to take a look at something.

831
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,990
- I'm off the clock.
- Just open it.

832
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,990
First class ticket to vancouver island.

833
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,090
Shoot! It's the wrong envelope.

834
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,690
- I think it's great.
- Yeah?

835
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,790
Who doesn't like canadians?

836
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,590
It's big.You're--
you're trying to have a life.

837
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,490
You're trying to enjoy yourself.

838
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,290
You didn't need to apologize.

839
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,890
I'm not, I told you why I'm--

840
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,990
you screwed up.

841
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,190
I saved a life.I saved two lives.

842
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,690
You let your maternal instinct
get the best of you

843
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,890
and nearly killed two people.

844
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,690
Case like this,you terminate,
mom lives 10 times out of 10.

845
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,790
You do what you did,mom and
baby both die 9.9 times out of 10.

846
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,790
Sometimes .1 is bigger than 9.9.

847
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,090
No, it's smaller.

848
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,790
Exactly 9.8 smaller.

849
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,890
Always is,always will be.

850
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,390
Well, not for emma.

851
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,290
And not for her son.

852
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,990
Now go away.

853
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,990
And be happy.

854
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,590
*Are you alright?*

855
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,190
*All of a sudden you went away*

856
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,690
*are you alright?*

857
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,590
*I hope you come back around some day*

858
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,990
*are you alright?*

859
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,890
*I haven't seen you in a real long time*

860
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,990
*are you alright?*

861
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,890
*Could you give me some kind of sign?*

862
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,490
*Are you alright?*

863
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,790
*Are you sleeping through the night?*

864
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,590
Do you have someone to hold you tight?

865
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,890
*Do you have someone to hang out with?*

866
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,690
*Do you have someone to hug and kiss you?*

867
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,590
*Hug and kiss you hug and kiss you*

868
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,490
*are you alright?*

869
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,890
*Hey*
