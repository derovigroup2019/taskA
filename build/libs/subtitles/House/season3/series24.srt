1
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,130
Coming up to 50 feet.

2
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:13,691
Roger that.

3
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:16,349
We're light on fuel.
Two minutes to bingo.

4
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:21,048
Come on, Fisher.
We got places to go, people to see.

5
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:22,994
- Workin' on it!
- So I?e heard.

6
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:24,474
What's taking so long?

7
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:32,114
Let go of the suitcase!

8
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:44,656
- You're gonna have to hold onto me!
- <i>Es de mi esposa, no puedo!</i>

9
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:47,334
Sir, whatever it is, it's not worth it!

10
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:49,756
We're at bingo fuel, sir.

11
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:51,257
You hear that, Fisher? Bingo.

12
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:53,636
Either reel him in or
we're leaving you both here.

13
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,587
Roger that, sir.

14
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,379
- Ditch the damn luggage!
- <i>Yo lo puedo aguantar, esta bien.</i>

15
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:13,981
Marina.

16
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:19,853
<i>Mi amor.</i>

17
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:21,644
<i>?estas bien?</i>

18
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:29,749
<i>Mi esposa esta enferma. Sus
expedientes medicos estaban enla maleta.</i>

19
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:32,456
Tell him if he's so worried
about his wife's clothes,

20
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:34,007
he should have stayed in Cuba!

21
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:37,936
<i>Oye, tenemos que regresar. Dr. House
necesita ver sus expedientes medicos.</i>

22
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:41,201
He says it wasn't her clothes.
It was her medical records.

23
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:43,292
Says she's sick and needs to go home.

24
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:46,597
No home. House.

25
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:48,487
I need to see Dr. House.

26
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:58,548
Transcript: swsub.com
Sync: jh26

27
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:59,243
You don't answer your phone anymore.

28
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:01,794
I'm world-famous now.
Press won't leave me alone.

29
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,085
- It's Cuddy.
- I know.

30
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:04,578
If it was the press, i'd be answering.

31
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,879
And since you're not
taking her calls, I am.

32
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:09,089
Your patient's been waiting for hours.

33
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,901
- She didn't book an appointment.
- No, she risked her life.

34
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:14,666
You don't reach terra firma,
you don't get any milk or honey.

35
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,297
The woman has ten different
things wrong with her,

36
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:20,369
including pains all over her body.

37
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:26,256
Admittedly, not as interesting
as staring uselessly at Foreman.

38
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:29,631
You know, I find the
good-bye party fascinating.

39
00:04:30,342 --> 00:04:33,125
Isn't it kind of insulting if
you celebrate when someone leaves you?

40
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:35,071
- What are you gonna do to keep him?
- Nothing.

41
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:36,372
He really is gonna leave.

42
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,579
You know that, right?

43
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,865
- Yeah.
- So what are you gonna do?

44
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,622
There isn't anything I can do.

45
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:44,175
He doesn't want more money,
better working conditions.

46
00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:45,926
He doesn't even want a better job.

47
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:48,014
He wants to not be me.

48
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,381
Because he thinks you're a cold-hearted
bastard without any regard for anyone

49
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:52,832
but yourself.
- He's right.

50
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:55,846
You need to show him
that you really do care.

51
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:57,331
Don't.

52
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:01,093
Foreman's not the only
chocolate-covered cherry in the box.

53
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,340
House, you play a guitar
you got in ninth grade.

54
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:06,326
Eighth.

55
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:10,255
You're living in the same apartment for
15 years. You drive a 10-year-old car.

56
00:05:10,256 --> 00:05:11,756
You are not good with change.

57
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,783
That used to be true, but I changed.

58
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:18,671
He's not afraid to be you.
He's afraid to be who he thinks you are.

59
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:26,724
Rheumatic fever would
explain the skin rash.

60
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,543
What about the double
vision or bloody urine?

61
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:29,995
They were lost at sea for three days.

62
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,072
Severe dehydration
causes kidney problems.

63
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:35,124
- And the double vision?
- Concussion during the shipwreck.

64
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:39,417
It all fits as long as each symptom
started when you think it started.

65
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:43,782
This would be a lot easier
if we had her medical records.

66
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:45,687
Any of you certified deep-sea divers?

67
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,166
She's from a dirt poor
country in the tropics.

68
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:51,147
Infectious disease and parasites
are the most likely cause

69
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:53,044
of unexplained pain,
fever, and skin rash.

70
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:54,545
We might as well start there.

71
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:58,294
If there's one thing Castro knows,
it's how to look great in green.

72
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:00,507
And if there are
two things castro knows,

73
00:06:00,508 --> 00:06:03,108
it's how to look great
in green and train doctors.

74
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:06,906
Even without the medical records, we can
assume she was drowned in antibiotics

75
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:08,807
before she risked drowning to see me.

76
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:10,701
So what doesn't Castro know?

77
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,537
How to lay his hands on
high-tech scanning equipment.

78
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:16,138
The pain, double vision
point us towards the head.

79
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,460
Cameron, get an MRI.
See what's cookin' in the old cabeza.

80
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:24,831
- Chase, check out the husband.
- Why? He hasn't complained of any pain.

81
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:28,082
Basic math... Take all her symptoms,
subtract his sea symptoms.

82
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:30,497
The remainder equals
her original symptoms.

83
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:49,436
Are you in any pain?

84
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:51,841
No. I'm just sunburned.

85
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Any blurred vision?

86
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:56,822
No.

87
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:58,591
So my wife...

88
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,359
She is with Dr. House?

89
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:03,238
She's with another doctor
who is part of Dr. House's team.

90
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:06,694
No, she's supposed to see Dr. House.
We have permission.

91
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,828
This is the way it works with Dr. House.

92
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,780
- I came a thousand miles to see him.
- He doesn't care.

93
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:15,055
I'm sorry, but that's who he is.

94
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:17,700
That's who you risked your life to see.

95
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,880
And you made the right choice.

96
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,121
Any other metal?

97
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:30,045
Must have been difficult on the boat.

98
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,241
When the storm came, yes, very much.

99
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:36,015
I pray while my husband, he, um...

100
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,351
?como se dice?

101
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:40,953
Uh, with the paddles?

102
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,049
- You were on a boat without a motor?
- No, no.

103
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:47,062
We start with the motor.
But it break on the first night.

104
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:52,406
My husband, he can fix anything.

105
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:55,941
A washing machine, a car.

106
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:57,852
A computer.

107
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:00,860
But that stupid motor...

108
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:03,899
And me.

109
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:06,422
These two he cannot fix.

110
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:08,497
He got you to us.

111
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,083
He never gave up.

112
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:15,161
No matter what happen,
he kept saying to me,

113
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:17,743
"don't worry.

114
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,783
"we will make it.

115
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:23,393
I'll take care of you."

116
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:27,614
That's Esteban.

117
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,136
He refuses to worry or pray.

118
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:37,421
He believe if you don't have one,
you don't need the other.

119
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:45,068
Husband has a pulled
muscle in his shoulder,

120
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:47,093
but no other pains or double vision.

121
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:50,747
Does have a fever, fungal rash,
a cough, and elevated bilirubin.

122
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,264
Foreman's not going anywhere.

123
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,298
He said that to you?

124
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:59,159
He doesn't really want to leave.
And you don't really want to let him.

125
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,978
You'll cave,
just like you did with Cameron.

126
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:04,561
Foreman's not as easy as Cameron.
But, of course, who is?

127
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:07,446
I'm in the room.

128
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:10,360
He may not want a date,
but he does want something.

129
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:12,286
Maybe it's something I can't offer.

130
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:14,294
- Then you'll just lie.
- He'd see through it.

131
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:16,995
Maybe. Or maybe he'll
just see what he wants to see.

132
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,621
She has MS. Explains the pain,
fatigue, double vision, kidney problems.

133
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:28,604
The kidney problems aren't connected.
Her husband has the same issues.

134
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:31,714
It is possible for 2 people to have the
same symptom for 2 different reasons.

135
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:34,234
If we're gonna take that approach,
then we might just throw out

136
00:09:34,235 --> 00:09:36,263
everything we got from
the husband and start over.

137
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:38,570
We could do that,
or we could do something productive.

138
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:41,471
Start her on interferon for the MS,
see if she improves.

139
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:46,035
I do like being productive.

140
00:09:47,705 --> 00:09:48,779
Well done. Do it.

141
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:55,823
Well done? Is that what you
think he wants, a pat on the head?

142
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,220
Go do your job.

143
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,042
She does not have MS.

144
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:13,231
I know it's not a pleasant
diagnosis to hear, but...

145
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:15,532
No, the doctors in
Cuba would have found MS.

146
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:18,863
What's that?

147
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,037
It's all right. Pulse-ox just came off.

148
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,847
- Marina, you can't...
- It hurts.

149
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:28,244
The pain is getting worse.

150
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:30,968
Your treatment isn't
working because it's not MS!

151
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,158
Does this hurt?

152
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,711
Either Foreman's way stronger
than he thinks he is, or...

153
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:46,550
Seriously, or...

154
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,372
She's too young for
osteoporosis that severe.

155
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:51,619
And too old for osteogenesis imperfecta.

156
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,964
- Which leaves bone cancer.
- Cancer's a long shot.

157
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:57,170
Why? Because metastatic tumors
don't explain the abnormal MRI,

158
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:59,765
kidney damage,
cotton mouth, double vision?

159
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,721
- Oh, wait, they do.
- Infection could do all that too.

160
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:03,761
It's not an infection.

161
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:06,113
Because you know the nonexistent
medical records confirm

162
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:09,216
that the brilliant doctors
in Cuba treated her for infection?

163
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:11,667
Or because you're trying
to kiss up to Foreman.

164
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:14,895
Because an infection
would cause a fever,

165
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,235
and the brilliant doctors who work

166
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:19,124
in my office have already crossed
that off the list because the husband.

167
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,033
You're the one who said

168
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:23,070
it's possible for 2 people to have the
same symptom for 2 different reasons.

169
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:24,137
And you're the one who said

170
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:27,231
if we do that, we might as well throw
out everything we got from the husband.

171
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:29,696
Right, and then you said
we should do something productive,

172
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:32,390
like breaking her arm?
- Foreman didn't break her arm.

173
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:34,777
- Of course he didn't.
- Cancer did.

174
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:37,628
Put her in a pet scan.
See what else is breaking.

175
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:42,469
This isn't gonna work. He's not a moron.

176
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:45,166
You can't just agree with
everything he says for two days

177
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:48,534
and hope he forgets the last
three years and how much he hates you.

178
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:51,496
Anything else?

179
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,929
When you get the results
of the pet scan, let me know.

180
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:26,387
I don't really care if
Foreman stays or goes, but...

181
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:27,439
You're fired.

182
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:35,899
What, because I- I yelled at you?

183
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:37,826
Because you've been here the longest,

184
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:39,881
you've learned all you can,

185
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:42,336
or you haven't learned anything at all.

186
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:44,095
Either way,

187
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:45,818
it's time for a change.

188
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:55,686
Fine.

189
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:15,063
No tumors in her arm.
Synovial membrane's working fine.

190
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,471
No hotspots, no bone cancer. Maybe
we should be looking for something else.

191
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:24,606
Is it raining out?

192
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,239
- House fired me.
- What?

193
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:29,332
Because you yelled at him?

194
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:32,045
"Time for a change,"
was the official explanation.

195
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:33,589
It makes no sense.

196
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,899
- Since when does House make sense?
- He always makes sense.

197
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,450
- He's angry.
- Yes, it's all about you, Foreman.

198
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:41,708
He's upset you're leaving,
so he fires Chase.

199
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:42,659
Excuse me.

200
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:44,818
By the humerus.

201
00:13:45,348 --> 00:13:46,398
She's got a hotspot.

202
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:22,669
- Why'd you fire Chase?
- Sure thing.

203
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,755
First, you tell me the
results of the pet scan.

204
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:27,346
- Did you fire him for me?
- Would you stay if I did?

205
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:28,780
You asked him to fire Chase?

206
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:29,805
- No!
- Yes.

207
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,340
You're frustrated with Foreman,
so you lash out, kick the dog?

208
00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:36,303
He's not gone five minutes,
and the name-calling starts.

209
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,152
- What's on the pet scan?
- Why'd you fire Chase?

210
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:41,903
- Do you know what's on the pet scan?
- You two, out.

211
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:45,322
Whoa, wait. What's on the pet scan?

212
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,472
You can't dump your entire department

213
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,089
just because you don't
know how to deal with an issue.

214
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,740
Yes, they are all irreplaceable.

215
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:54,667
If only this country
had figured out a way

216
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:56,556
to somehow teach people
to interpret pet scans.

217
00:14:56,557 --> 00:14:58,733
What the hell's wrong with you?
You fired Chase?

218
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:01,030
I don't suppose you know
what's on my patient's pet scan.

219
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:03,282
I told you to show
Foreman you have a heart.

220
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,414
How does that translate
into you being a bastard?

221
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:06,149
So that's a no.

222
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,850
Pick up the phone and
tell Chase you made a mistake.

223
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:10,106
Un-fire him.

224
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:19,411
If you know what's on the pet scan,
call me back.

225
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:22,635
- Cut the crap.
- Chase is a good doctor.

226
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:24,445
Sorry, you're in the wrong room.

227
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:26,764
My name on the door.
My team, my decisions.

228
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:29,259
My building, my floor, my people.

229
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:32,587
Hold that reprimand.

230
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,218
Dr. Chase.

231
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:37,698
How are ya?

232
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:40,767
Thank you.

233
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:43,137
You are indispensable.

234
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:46,622
You're still fired.

235
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:48,011
Sorry.

236
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:50,228
That was awkward.

237
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:54,132
Pet scan revealed a blood clot
in my patient's arm, which means...

238
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:55,338
Good-bye.

239
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:59,139
Still got two people working for me.
I gotta get one of them to do my job.

240
00:16:02,403 --> 00:16:05,899
A clot means a heart problem.
We have to do an emergency angiogram.

241
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,050
How do you know she has a blood clot?

242
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,401
Pet scan can't determine
that with certainty.

243
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,991
You have no better idea of what's wrong
with her than when we first got here?

244
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:16,233
- We've ruled out MS.
- I told you it wasn't MS.

245
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:19,154
- Where's Dr. House?
- Dr. House has left for the night.

246
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:23,005
He'll be here in the morning to review
the results if you sign the consent.

247
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:30,975
But,

248
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:32,905
you know...

249
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:34,985
You could call him at home.

250
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:37,831
He doesn't always pick up.

251
00:16:38,183 --> 00:16:39,133
So keep calling.

252
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,534
Thank you.

253
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:51,704
Dr. House, it's Esteban Hernandez again.

254
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:55,893
As soon as you get home,
it's very important you call me.

255
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:06,054
Hello, yes, Dr. House.
It's Esteban Hernandez.

256
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:08,952
As soon as you get home,
if you can please call me.

257
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:16,143
- Catheter's in her femoral artery.
- Why are you telling me that?

258
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:20,018
- Because you're assisting.
- Do I look like I? assisting?

259
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:23,286
I had nothing to do
with Chase's termination.

260
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,813
Is everything okay?

261
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:27,316
You're doing fine, Marina.

262
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:29,916
The dye will take a minute
to work its way through your system.

263
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,166
Why would you tell him
you're leaving cause he's a jerk?

264
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,315
Because it's the truth.

265
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:37,272
Did you give an angry
cuban my home number?

266
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,873
Why would you do that?

267
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:40,994
You're not turning into House.
You're worse than him.

268
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:42,073
Let me get this straight.

269
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:45,641
Instead of picking up the phone and
talking to a patient for five minutes,

270
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:47,642
you gave up on sleep and drove in here.

271
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,080
My chest.

272
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:52,208
She's in v-tach.

273
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,039
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

274
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:56,751
You must have hit something.
Did you nick an artery?

275
00:17:57,111 --> 00:17:58,061
She has no pulse.

276
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,400
It hurts.

277
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,640
She has no pulse, but she's talking.

278
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:08,996
Cough.

279
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:11,163
Cough again.

280
00:18:11,526 --> 00:18:14,509
Keep coughing. It'll push blood
into your head, keep you conscious.

281
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,774
Push 1 milligram epinephrine.

282
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:16,738
Will...

283
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,016
That...

284
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:19,632
Help?

285
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,904
No. But it is amazingly cool.

286
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:24,866
We need to get her on bypass...

287
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,649
We need to keep her here.
If this is a clot,

288
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,162
then the force of bypass will
blow it into her brain, kill her.

289
00:18:29,163 --> 00:18:32,114
If we continue CPR, she'll lose blood
flow, which will cause brain damage.

290
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:34,880
What caused the heart to stop?
Let's assume it wasn't human error.

291
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,548
I didn't nick an artery.
It just stopped.

292
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:37,501
I said, let's assume.

293
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:39,432
The only other option
is electrical instability.

294
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:40,729
No ST segment changes.

295
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:43,455
We need to tell the husband.

296
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,806
Tell him what?
We have no idea what happened.

297
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:52,419
Keep going till I figure this out.

298
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:02,182
Jeez, at 47 I hope my colon
looks better than this guy's.

299
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,541
Isolating the first transverse.

300
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,868
Help! I'm trapped inside a monitor!

301
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:15,226
Not a good time, House.

302
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:19,065
My patient lost her heartbeat during
a routine cardiac catheterization, so...

303
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:21,066
- Human error.
- It's not human error.

304
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,490
Electrical instability?

305
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:24,794
Pre-procedure EKG was normal.
No syncope.

306
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:25,961
Ischemia?

307
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,864
Foreman said no ST segment changes.

308
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,089
Human error is the
only other possible...

309
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,311
It's not human error.

310
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:34,714
Of course it's human error. You don't
want Foreman to have made a mistake,

311
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,174
because then you'd have to mock him.

312
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,726
And that would put a crimp
in your brilliant plan of keeping him

313
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:40,727
by having a breakdown and firing Chase.

314
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,335
Did you just spit on a monitor?
You know I can't see you.

315
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:48,211
Human error would
not explain her symptoms.

316
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,075
You mean her heart stopping?

317
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,053
And her foot pain, her back pain.

318
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:56,454
House, I? busy. You have a team.
Run your differential with them.

319
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,725
Foreman and Cameron are doing CPR.

320
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,681
Then you shouldn't have fired Chase.

321
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,189
Change is fun, huh?

322
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:09,204
Five, six, seven, eight.

323
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:10,298
Go.

324
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:12,835
Someone's gotta talk to the husband.

325
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,028
He thought this whole thing
was gonna last 45 minutes.

326
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,990
Half an hour more of this,
nothing to talk about.

327
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:19,638
We won't be able to bring her back.
We've gotta get her on bypass.

328
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:21,345
House still isn't answering his phone.

329
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,530
You, get in here.

330
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:25,134
Go.

331
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:30,839
Excuse me, my wife was supposed
to be back an hour ago...

332
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:33,204
As soon as we know anything,
we'll call you.

333
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:34,481
Thank you.

334
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:44,873
Human behavior finals will also get
into clinical presentations of mania.

335
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:49,425
And... We'll touch on Stanislas
Dehaene's pet scans...

336
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:50,717
Excuse me, professor.

337
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:54,168
House, when we're
done with our rounds...

338
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:55,585
My patient has no heartbeat.

339
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:58,991
Stopped when we inserted a
catheter during a routine angiogram.

340
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:03,398
Anyone tells me why her heart
stopped gets an A in Dr. Cuddy's class.

341
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:05,788
Anyone.

342
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:07,628
Human error?

343
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:09,750
Yeah, I? polling
first-year medical students

344
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:11,751
'cause I hadn't considered human error.

345
00:21:11,758 --> 00:21:12,708
Marfan syndrome.

346
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:16,018
Structural abnormalities would
show up on the echo. You get a C.

347
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:17,299
Yeah?

348
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,058
- Botox injections.
- F.

349
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,195
If the injection was tainted
with live botulism, it'd fit.

350
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:24,732
B+. Unfortunately,

351
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:27,889
she missed her last botox appointment
due to a boating accident.

352
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,290
- But send me your resume.
- House, time's up.

353
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:33,450
Good lord. You smell like musk ox.

354
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,170
Either our patient goes on bypass,
or I call time of death.

355
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,287
- Your patient isn't already on bypass?
- I was worried about a clot.

356
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:40,728
- How long?
- Three hours.

357
00:21:40,903 --> 00:21:42,801
House. Bypass. Now.

358
00:21:58,809 --> 00:21:59,759
Clear the hall!

359
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:05,056
Dr. Foreman! My wife...

360
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:06,407
What has happened?

361
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,366
Her heart stopped.
We have to get her on bypass.

362
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:09,667
He needs to wait outside.

363
00:22:27,605 --> 00:22:28,555
Dr. House.

364
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:29,969
You can vacuum later.

365
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:33,441
I am not the janitor.
I am Esteban Hernandez.

366
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:35,014
What happened to my wife?

367
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,473
Her heart stopped.

368
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:41,569
- Wh-why did her heart stop?
- If I knew that, I? be coming to you.

369
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,456
Tell me where you take her.
Tell me what is happen to her.

370
00:22:44,457 --> 00:22:45,407
Happening.

371
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:47,339
It's the present participle.

372
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:51,996
Not a particularly interesting form
of speech. Kinda like this conversation.

373
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:53,912
But I-I risk my life to see you.

374
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:55,621
I look you up. You fix people.

375
00:22:55,813 --> 00:22:58,606
When everyone else gives up, you don't.
And now you...

376
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:00,623
Insult me? Ignore my wife?

377
00:23:01,094 --> 00:23:02,044
Helps my process.

378
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:05,131
You do not ignore my wife, okay?
She's everything to me.

379
00:23:05,173 --> 00:23:07,173
Well, then you do not ignore your wife.

380
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:09,688
You just sit here.
You don't talk to people.

381
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:13,362
How do you fix something
if you don't look at it?

382
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,573
Turn on the bypass, please.

383
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:32,243
Good.

384
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:33,968
Good distal flow.

385
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:38,397
- Need to look at the heart.
- Why?

386
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,041
I can't find my wallet.
Pick it up. Turn it over.

387
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:43,242
I don't see anything physically
wrong with her heart.

388
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:46,929
- Hearts don't stop for no reason.
- Okay, take your look.

389
00:23:51,535 --> 00:23:52,735
You see anything wrong?

390
00:23:56,429 --> 00:23:57,579
Give her a jump-start.

391
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:03,985
Clear.

392
00:24:11,026 --> 00:24:11,976
And again.

393
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:19,153
Again.

394
00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:22,227
Yeah. Seventh time is the charm. Sorry.

395
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:25,792
I'll keep her on bypass till her
husband has a chance to say good-bye.

396
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:28,759
I'm not telling her husband anything
until I can tell him why his wife...

397
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,845
It doesn't matter.
Her heart can't start.

398
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:32,896
She's dead.

399
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,440
I got you something.

400
00:25:00,362 --> 00:25:01,312
I'll miss you.

401
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:04,292
I know you won't miss me, but...

402
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:07,811
I just thought it would
be nice for you to have that.

403
00:25:10,835 --> 00:25:12,200
I will miss you.

404
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,451
Can I have a hug too?

405
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:23,680
Surgeon found nothing.
Can't start her heart.

406
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,623
What a thoughtful gift.

407
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,053
Nice reminder of intellectual theft
to hang at your new place of employment.

408
00:25:31,054 --> 00:25:34,565
You two can go. Say hi to Chase for me.
You're wearing lipstick.

409
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:38,583
We can stay.
We can run another differential.

410
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:40,908
You two have no theories
about why the heart stopped,

411
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:42,343
which means I don't need you... Go.

412
00:25:42,344 --> 00:25:45,089
It's too late for theories.
We need to tell the husband.

413
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,551
- Tell him what?
- That it's over.

414
00:25:46,552 --> 00:25:48,602
- Why?
- Because her heart won't start.

415
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:52,424
How can we tell him there's no hope
if we don't know why there's no hope?

416
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,326
He's not gonna pull
the plug on his wife.

417
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:56,740
He risked his life to get her to me.

418
00:25:56,741 --> 00:25:58,478
If he pulls the plug,
it means he's failed.

419
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:00,445
If he pulls the plug,
it means you failed.

420
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:01,796
And you're okay with that?

421
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:05,411
Go.

422
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:25,915
You look great.

423
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:29,033
You know House firing
you has nothing to do with you.

424
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:30,617
The why doesn't matter.

425
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:32,024
Foreman'll end up staying.

426
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:34,656
House'll call you,
probably yell at you for not showing up.

427
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:35,672
It's... It's okay.

428
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,470
He's right.

429
00:26:38,937 --> 00:26:40,199
It's time for a change.

430
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:43,158
You were right too.

431
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,766
The whole "It's tuesday,
I- I like you" was...

432
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:48,724
It was silly.

433
00:26:50,823 --> 00:26:53,830
Don't give me that look.
Don't feel sorry for me.

434
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:57,427
Getting this job was the best
thing that has ever happened to me.

435
00:26:58,078 --> 00:26:59,978
Everything about it. And losing it...

436
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:03,380
Well, I think it's...

437
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:06,962
Gonna be... good too.

438
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:10,834
I'll miss you.

439
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:14,859
You got time for a drink or something?

440
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:17,275
I think I should go.

441
00:27:20,258 --> 00:27:21,208
Yeah.

442
00:27:52,822 --> 00:27:53,772
How's it going?

443
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,861
The way the security
light hits your legs...

444
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,140
Looks good.

445
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:04,803
Thank you.

446
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:12,187
If you're here to yell at me about the
Foreman/Chase situation, it can wait.

447
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:15,818
When do you plan on telling the husband
it's time to say good-bye to his wife?

448
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,169
Haven't put a clock on it.

449
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:22,281
Other than your curiosity, do you
have any reason to keep her on bypass?

450
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:25,176
Patient's husband prefers her not dead.

451
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:27,768
Or you want a storybook
ending for the young man

452
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:29,534
who crossed the ocean for his wife.

453
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,768
This is not an act. I don't care.

454
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:32,830
Then pull the plug.

455
00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:35,221
What if I can fix it,
but I just don't know it yet?

456
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:37,200
- I know you care.
- I don't care.

457
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:40,196
I really don't care.

458
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:43,775
My motives are pure.

459
00:28:45,104 --> 00:28:48,120
If we do an autopsy and we see, oops...

460
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:53,753
If i'd thought of that crazy idea,
we could have saved her,

461
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:57,537
then the husband might be upset.

462
00:28:57,805 --> 00:28:59,205
You've done all you can do.

463
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:01,398
It's time to let go.

464
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:23,085
I was told you didn't believe in God.

465
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,790
I don't.

466
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:29,542
I promised my wife I?l
do everything I can to fix her.

467
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,757
If I don't pray,
then I don't do everything.

468
00:29:37,717 --> 00:29:38,667
It's not working.

469
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:41,218
She's not coming back.

470
00:29:42,924 --> 00:29:45,834
If you want to say good-bye,
you can come down to the ICU,

471
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:47,585
and then I?l take her off bypass.

472
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:53,849
I'm sorry. I should have...

473
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,309
I am so sorry.

474
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,610
When you turn the machine off,

475
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:13,282
that's it?

476
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:15,857
Yeah.

477
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,786
- Right now is her brain working?
- Probably.

478
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:23,875
Just not her heart.

479
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,544
She seems like she's just sleeping.

480
00:30:26,545 --> 00:30:27,545
She's not sleeping.

481
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,666
We double-checked.

482
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:27,702
Her heart.

483
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,300
It beats.

484
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:32,429
No. It's residual flow from the bypass.

485
00:31:33,428 --> 00:31:34,478
No, I-I can feel it.

486
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,469
Look.

487
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:55,289
That is her heart, no?

488
00:31:56,404 --> 00:31:59,962
P wave, QRS, T wave.
It's a normal normal.

489
00:32:06,082 --> 00:32:07,187
Holy crap.

490
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:09,825
Is this heaven?

491
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:12,952
No. It's New Jersey.

492
00:32:13,674 --> 00:32:14,924
God send you back to me.

493
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,749
It's a miracle.

494
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,733
- It's impossible.
- Apparently not.

495
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:35,248
Live hearts don't stop for no reason.

496
00:32:35,905 --> 00:32:37,855
Dead hearts don't start for no reason.

497
00:32:38,032 --> 00:32:39,103
Apparently, they do.

498
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:43,389
She's three hours off bypass
and still stable. And the pain is gone.

499
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:44,867
No, it's not.

500
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:47,295
You think she's lying
about feeling better?

501
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,903
Just 'cause it's not there
now doesn't mean it's gone.

502
00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:52,451
Just because it was there
before doesn't mean it's coming back.

503
00:32:52,452 --> 00:32:53,752
Chase was probably right.

504
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:56,667
She had some sort of tropical
infection that cleared

505
00:32:56,668 --> 00:32:58,874
when we put her on
antibiotics during the bypass.

506
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,125
Antibiotics did not
bring her back to life.

507
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:05,265
Other than a miracle, it's
the only explanation for her symptoms.

508
00:33:06,012 --> 00:33:08,962
How come God gets credit
whenever something good happens?

509
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:11,899
Where was he when her heart stopped?

510
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:16,719
What if it wasn't human error?

511
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:23,085
What if it was God's error?
A congenital defect

512
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:27,497
in an artery making it
susceptible to inflammation.

513
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,214
We need to do another angiogram.

514
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:33,277
We've looked at her heart a hundred
different ways. There was no evidence...

515
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,034
The time we looked inside,
we stopped before we could see anything.

516
00:33:36,035 --> 00:33:37,035
Because it stopped.

517
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,061
Good news.

518
00:33:51,984 --> 00:33:53,884
We think we know what the problem is.

519
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,316
You mean was.

520
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:57,585
Hey, it's my first language, not yours.

521
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:01,121
If she wants to outlive Castro,
we need to fix her heart.

522
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:02,536
?qui quiere?

523
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:04,923
In case no one's filled you in,
today is monday,

524
00:34:04,924 --> 00:34:06,883
which means you've been dead for a day.

525
00:34:06,884 --> 00:34:09,834
When that kind of symptom comes back,
it can get serious.

526
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:13,836
I need to do another angiogram.

527
00:34:13,837 --> 00:34:16,793
Wait. Wasn't that what
caused her heart to stop before?

528
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:18,163
No. God caused that.

529
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,336
He's all-powerful, you know.

530
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:21,562
Si. Lo es.

531
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:26,056
He was watching over us in the ocean.
And he's watching over us now.

532
00:34:26,249 --> 00:34:29,705
Your rescuers didn't have wings.
They had a helicopter.

533
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:30,904
Esteban prayed.

534
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:33,893
You know how many little
boys are praying for jet packs?

535
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:35,801
How many priests are praying for...

536
00:34:37,927 --> 00:34:39,255
Well, that one actually works.

537
00:34:39,256 --> 00:34:40,743
You didn't bring me back to him.

538
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:43,718
And I? not gonna take you away
from him. But if we don't do this test,

539
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,669
God will.

540
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:46,801
You said there was no chance,

541
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:49,228
no hope, which means...

542
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:51,979
Which means I was wrong.
But I? wrong all the time.

543
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:54,628
My mistakes don't prove there's a God.

544
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:58,122
You came a long way to see me.

545
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,080
You gonna put her life
in God's hands or in mine?

546
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,116
Ready?

547
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:19,205
I'd better not see you praying!

548
00:35:19,692 --> 00:35:22,142
I don't wanna have to
fight for credit on this.

549
00:35:23,283 --> 00:35:26,955
Exiting the femoral,
entering the aortic arch.

550
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:28,201
This is where...

551
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,511
Where we stopped to
have a picnic last week.

552
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,168
- Her blood pressure's rising.
- Mine's rising too.

553
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:35,469
Of course,
I am doing battle with the deity.

554
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:38,624
In the heart.

555
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:42,302
Injecting the dye.

556
00:35:46,158 --> 00:35:49,599
Right coronary flow's unobstructed.
Left coronary flow looks normal.

557
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,652
Looks like you're wrong.

558
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:54,598
Either I? right,
or this test is about to go very bad.

559
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:01,955
What's that?

560
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,956
She has one, two,

561
00:36:08,843 --> 00:36:09,980
a third ostium.

562
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,630
How many is she supposed to have?

563
00:36:13,443 --> 00:36:14,393
Dos.

564
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:16,890
All the third one's doing
is causing inflammation,

565
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:19,576
throwing off clots,
getting in the way of the angiogram.

566
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,160
No human would screw up that big.
Don't worry.

567
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:25,607
Just one more surgery,
and you'll be fine.

568
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:27,615
Thank God.

569
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:29,856
Don't make me slap you.

570
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:47,504
It's tuesday.

571
00:36:51,802 --> 00:36:53,832
No, it's monday.

572
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:56,743
I know. I just...

573
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:00,567
I didn't feel like waiting.

574
00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:16,053
I hear you got another
satisfied customer.

575
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:19,970
One more,
and I get a set of steak knives.

576
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:27,825
Well... This is it.

577
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,784
I appreciate the
opportunity you gave me.

578
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,850
Didn't do it for you.

579
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,039
Thought you were the
best guy for the job.

580
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:40,846
Thanks. I guess.

581
00:37:41,782 --> 00:37:43,432
Which is why I want you to stay.

582
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,208
You're an important part of the team.

583
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:51,289
I need you.

584
00:37:56,337 --> 00:37:57,287
I know.

585
00:37:59,137 --> 00:38:00,237
But I don't need you.

586
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:02,565
And I definitely don't want to be you...

587
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,760
You're miserable.

588
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:07,743
I just solved a case by predicting
a never-before-seen heart defect.

589
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:09,826
Case you couldn't solve.

590
00:38:10,152 --> 00:38:12,402
Case you gave up on.
I couldn't be happier.

591
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:15,717
For two minutes,
maybe, until the next case comes along,

592
00:38:15,984 --> 00:38:18,034
until you're jonesing for your next fix.

593
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:20,746
This woman talks while
in full cardiac arrest,

594
00:38:20,874 --> 00:38:23,423
and you're more excited about
the talking than the heart dying.

595
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:26,228
- The two were connected.
- I don't want to solve cases.

596
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:29,237
- I want to save lives.
- Do you think she cares?

597
00:38:30,371 --> 00:38:33,330
You think the husband cares?
You think the children she can now have

598
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:35,681
because of me are gonna
care why I saved her?

599
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:37,388
- I care.
- About yourself.

600
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:39,188
About your own ego.

601
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:43,526
You're the selfish bastard, not me.
Which is why you took so much pleasure

602
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:46,245
drawing out this little good-bye
of yours for the last three weeks.

603
00:38:46,246 --> 00:38:47,988
It wasn't for me. It wasn't for anyone.

604
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:49,639
Sure as hell didn't help anyone.

605
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,680
Nice try.

606
00:39:09,854 --> 00:39:11,192
Nice tries are worthless.

607
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,676
You now have a bigger office than I do.

608
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:43,128
Why don't you go enjoy it?

609
00:39:46,712 --> 00:39:48,025
Better be naked pictures.

610
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:50,408
My resignation letter.

611
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:00,754
I've gotten all I can from this job.

612
00:40:03,343 --> 00:40:04,793
What do you expect me to do?

613
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:08,525
Break down and apologize?
Beg Chase to come back?

614
00:40:09,214 --> 00:40:10,164
No.

615
00:40:11,013 --> 00:40:12,963
I expect you to do what you always do.

616
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:14,923
I expect you to make a joke and go on.

617
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,519
I expect you to be just fine.

618
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,720
I'll miss you.

619
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:38,526
Genuine american cigars.

620
00:40:39,669 --> 00:40:42,892
You guys can't get them in Cuba.
100% healthy.

621
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,250
Shouldn't you go home?

622
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:47,318
Patient follow-up. Very important.

623
00:40:51,822 --> 00:40:53,722
She looks great. Like she's sleeping.

624
00:40:56,084 --> 00:40:57,034
She is sleeping.

625
00:40:57,492 --> 00:40:58,442
I double-check.

626
00:41:01,547 --> 00:41:02,497
So...

627
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:03,975
They all quit.

628
00:41:04,924 --> 00:41:05,874
Two of them quit.

629
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,248
I fired the third.

630
00:41:07,594 --> 00:41:09,394
It's very hard to lose your people.

631
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Must be very upset.

632
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:14,208
Yeah, I must be.

633
00:41:15,912 --> 00:41:16,862
But you're not?

634
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:19,841
I don't think I am.

635
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:23,838
I think I?...

636
00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:26,005
Okay.

637
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:28,513
What are you going to do?

638
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:31,691
God only knows.
