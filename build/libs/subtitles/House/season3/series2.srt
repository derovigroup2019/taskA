1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,368
Mom!

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,344
- I'm thirsty.
- I just gave you water.

3
00:00:09,752 --> 00:00:10,702
I want juice.

4
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:11,949
It's bedtime.

5
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:14,726
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

6
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:36,399
Mom!

7
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:40,347
What do you want, Clance?

8
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,429
Hi, Dad.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,790
Go to bed.

10
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:46,963
- Can I turn the TV on?
- TV is only for the daytime.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,576
I'll keep the volume down.
I just like the light.

12
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:50,826
Go to bed.

13
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:52,594
Dad, what if...

14
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:56,691
What if they come to get me again?

15
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:01,062
Nobody is coming to get you. OK?

16
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:02,732
Go to bed. Now.

17
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:37,852
Come on, Clancy.

18
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,292
It's time to get up.

19
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:49,232
- I guess he's already up.
- That's a first.

20
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:53,082
I-I will,
uh, I'll see if he needs breakfast.

21
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:58,230
Hey, Clance, you hungry?

22
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:03,962
Hon, he's not down here.

23
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:06,392
You sure?

24
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:08,661
Clancy?

25
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:19,170
Clancy?

26
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:24,960
Where are you?

27
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:29,611
- Sweetie, are you hiding?
- Clancy?

28
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:31,233
Where is he?

29
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:40,101
You're gonna be in big
trouble when I find you.

30
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:43,831
Honey, come out right now,
wherever you are. This is not funny.

31
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
House S03E02
Cane and Able

32
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,262
Where's the sweat and the B.O.?

33
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:52,272
You've taken such pride
in bathing us all in your musk.

34
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:55,171
- Showered at home.
- And yet you're earlier than usual.

35
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:57,110
Is this an intervention?

36
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:00,141
It's a little late,
since I'm not using drugs anymore.

37
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:02,140
I am, however, still hooked on phonics.

38
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:05,631
If you did your morning run and showered
at home, you'd be later than usual.

39
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:07,132
Thought of you in the shower.

40
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:08,363
How's your leg?

41
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:10,481
You seem to be favoring your left side.

42
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:12,591
I was hanging down my
right pant leg yesterday.

43
00:06:12,597 --> 00:06:15,651
- Makes all the difference in the world.
- You've taken the stairs every day.

44
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:18,750
- Did I need a restraining order?
- You slack on your rehab,

45
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:21,521
the muscle will weaken.
And your leg will hurt again.

46
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:26,872
Looks like the Ketamine
treatment might not stick.

47
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:30,390
Or maybe we've made him depressed
because we're lying to him.

48
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,352
- Telling him he got that case wrong.
- We didn't hurt him. The pain isn't...

49
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:36,171
He gets depressed, he stops exercising.

50
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:38,322
He stops exercising,
the muscle atrophies.

51
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:40,321
The muscle atrophies, the pain returns.

52
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:44,440
Maybe he stopped exercising because the
giant hole in his leg actually hurts.

53
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:46,273
The Ketamine could work perfectly

54
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:49,900
and he would still be back
on his cane popping Vicodin again.

55
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:51,902
You can't tell him.

56
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:54,550
He got lucky. There was no medical...

57
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:55,731
He was right.

58
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:59,052
We tell him he was right,
and we're feeding his addiction.

59
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:01,593
Without Vicodin,
he's only got one to focus on.

60
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:05,192
- Well, he's not gonna O.D. on puzzles.
- No, it's not gonna hurt him.

61
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:08,833
But he could just as easily
have killed that patient.

62
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:14,513
We have a tiny window of time here where
House may be healthy enough to change.

63
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:15,823
And based on that limp,

64
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:17,932
the window's closing fast.

65
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:25,513
Kid is a product of an
in vitro fertilization pregnancy.

66
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:27,240
Had all his vaccinations.

67
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:30,870
Fractured his right ulna at age three,
chicken pox at age five...

68
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:32,821
Did he ever get his feelings hurt?

69
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:36,060
I'll need to know that too.

70
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:39,970
You are 0 for 1 since you came back.
We just wanna make sure...

71
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:43,590
Rectal bleeding plus alien abduction
fantasies, most likely sexual abuse.

72
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:46,110
Penetration causes the bleed,
trauma causes the fantasy.

73
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:49,741
E. R. ran a rape kit, found no evidence
of tearing, semen, or pubic hairs.

74
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:51,502
I think we should talk to the kid.

75
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,000
Why?

76
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:54,963
In case he's telling the truth?

77
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:57,971
You're a believer, aren't you?

78
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:01,921
I'm just not arrogant enough to
think that of the 50 billion galaxies,

79
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:06,233
100 billion stars per galaxy and ten
million billion planets in the universe,

80
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:08,053
that we're the only ones with life.

81
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:09,023
No. But

82
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:12,162
I'm guessing we're the only ones who like
shoving things through our backdoors.

83
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:15,082
There is new research indicating
a link between neurological problems

84
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:16,731
- and bleeding disorders.
- Perfect.

85
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:19,141
Especially if there
were neurological problems.

86
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,901
What part of hallucinating
an alien abduction isn't neurological?

87
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:25,112
- It wasn't a hallucination.
- What?

88
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:28,303
- You think the kid...
- Is having nightmares.

89
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:32,610
Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything
other than wanting to sleep with mommy.

90
00:08:32,617 --> 00:08:35,203
Which just leaves us with one symptom,
the bloody tuchus.

91
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:38,493
Which can easily be explained by a G.
I. problem or a bleeding disorder.

92
00:08:38,495 --> 00:08:41,423
Check his coags with a PT,
PTT, and bleeding time.

93
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:45,182
Prep him for endoscopies
from above and below.

94
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:53,521
Gonna make a tiny nick
in your forearm, okay?

95
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,761
Then I'm gonna time how long
it takes for you to stop bleeding.

96
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:02,342
This is gonna sting a little,
so you might want to look the other way.

97
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:11,201
Are those windows locked?

98
00:09:11,547 --> 00:09:14,892
Those windows don't even open.
They're just here to let sunshine in.

99
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:16,662
Good. 'Cause they know I'm here.

100
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:17,992
Clancy...

101
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:20,462
don't bother the doctor with this stuff.

102
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,711
No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?

103
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:25,663
They put a chip in my neck
so they can keep track of me.

104
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:27,633
I  can feel it back there.

105
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:30,591
Clancy, you know there
is nothing back there.

106
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:32,270
-  There is.
- Let me see.

107
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:33,862
Lean forwards.

108
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:37,533
And they have this other thing.
And they put it...

109
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:40,010
in between these two ribs.
Always on this side.

110
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:42,930
And then they move it around my insides.

111
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:45,711
- It hurts.
- You know what, Clancy?

112
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:49,231
I think I might have
found the chip back there.

113
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:51,143
And I think I might
be able to get it out.

114
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:52,241
-  Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

115
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:57,272
Okay, lean forwards.

116
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,172
Now hold very still, okay?

117
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:04,721
Got it.

118
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:10,031
I'm seven... not three.

119
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:12,142
All you did was pinch my neck.

120
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:17,300
Sorry.

121
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:21,310
His alien abduction story,
the level of detail is...

122
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:24,011
I don't know where he gets it from.

123
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:26,832
The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi,
he doesn't read comic books.

124
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:29,233
Great. You do any of that
medical stuff we talked about?

125
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:31,190
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.

126
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,960
So, it's a simple bleeding disorder.

127
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,013
No. Blood tests were all normal.
And he clotted in six minutes.

128
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:39,401
So it's a simple bleeding
disorder and you screwed up the test.

129
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,312
I didn't screw up the test.

130
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:43,392
So it's a U.F.O.

131
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:46,232
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.

132
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:50,091
Either you screwed up the test or
I screwed up my analysis of this case.

133
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,310
If you screwed up,
I don't have to cry myself to sleep.

134
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:56,202
It's a simple bleeding disorder.
Foreman, redo the test.

135
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:58,892
How could I screw up
a simple bleeding time test?

136
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:02,562
Maybe you were abducted and lost time.

137
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:12,782
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.

138
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:14,653
You're sure?

139
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:17,251
I had to stop the bleeding
myself after 25 minutes.

140
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:21,900
So you're saying Chase did screw up.

141
00:11:23,888 --> 00:11:25,600
Or Foreman screwed up.

142
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:28,813
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.

143
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:30,382
Oh, snap.

144
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,216
Foreman's playin' the dozens. You're at
a huge cultural disadvantage here, Chase.

145
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:36,256
Take a couple minutes
to think of a witty retort.

146
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:38,214
So we have contradicting
bleeding time tests.

147
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:41,462
If we run labs to check his clotting fac-
tors, we can confirm which one's right.

148
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:42,792
Yeah, testing. Nice idea.

149
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,700
Way better than trying to
guess which doctor's incompetent.

150
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:47,452
Looks better in the paperwork too.

151
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:48,453
Hey, Foreman,

152
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:53,051
your mama's so fat, when her beeper
goes off, people think she's backing up.

153
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:06,453
Where's Clancy?

154
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:08,053
He's asleep. He's...

155
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,070
House!

156
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,202
Clancy's gone missing.

157
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:18,133
Oh, no!

158
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:22,133
You take Alpha Centauri,
Foreman can look on Tatooine,

159
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,960
and Cameron can set up
an intergalactic checkpoint.

160
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,713
Let's pray he hasn't gone into
hyperdrive. We'll never catch him.

161
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:37,812
Clancy?

162
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:42,500
I had to go where there are no windows so
I could get the chip out like you said.

163
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:43,451
God.

164
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:48,472
- I can feel it, I just can't grab it.
- Clancy, stop! There is no chip.

165
00:12:51,597 --> 00:12:54,740
We're gonna clean you up and
we're gonna go back to your room.

166
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:57,331
You can't do things like this.

167
00:12:58,037 --> 00:12:58,980
Your parents--

168
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,000
Results came back.
The lab cannot identify the metal.

169
00:13:23,798 --> 00:13:26,000
Said it might not even be terrestrial.

170
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:28,500
- Really?
- No, you idiot, it's titanium.

171
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:30,840
Like from a surgical pin.

172
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:34,752
Like the kind the kid had inserted
into his broken arm four years ago.

173
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:37,792
- Nice medical history.
- That pin was removed six months after.

174
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:39,990
So a little piece
broke off during removal.

175
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:43,770
Titanium is used to build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.

176
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:45,563
Tell that to guys on the Kursk.

177
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,112
And how exactly did it get
from his arm to the back of his neck?

178
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,840
Body attacks any foreign object.

179
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:54,832
Inflammatory reaction could erode it
into a vein, fragment gets a free ride.

180
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:57,260
To his lungs, maybe. Not his neck.

181
00:13:57,585 --> 00:14:00,131
Yeah, an alien chip makes more sense.

182
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,912
The real mystery is that
you didn't actually screw up.

183
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:06,122
You okay?

184
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:08,582
Fine. Tripped.

185
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:13,571
Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck
and apparently didn't bleed to death.

186
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,363
- Now, that's weird.
- He clotted on his own?

187
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:17,581
Sure did.

188
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:21,993
So first there was no bleeding disorder,
then there was, now there is not again.

189
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:25,110
- Which is impossible.
- Or Foreman screwed up.

190
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:27,931
Two out of three tests
agree with my findings.

191
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:30,681
Well, lucky for us,
the fourth test will be the charm.

192
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,192
So you're just gonna keep cutting him?
Until what?

193
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:39,582
This test is different.

194
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:43,961
We draw some blood and see if
any clotting factors are low or missing.

195
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:45,822
But why haven't the other tests--

196
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:49,241
We've got three results that haven't been
consistent. One of them must be wrong.

197
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:50,200
Or two of them.

198
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:56,012
Is it possible the problem isn't
his blood? It's just psychological.

199
00:14:57,365 --> 00:15:01,181
- I mean, he almost killed himself.
- He wasn't trying to hurt himself.

200
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:05,392
No... he was just looking
for an alien tracking device.

201
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:10,180
I have time for one more.

202
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,313
Don't blame you for spending
extra time down here.

203
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:16,571
Heard the artist formerly
known as gimp is back upstairs.

204
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:18,551
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.

205
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,200
She's busy. I'll take it.

206
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:25,842
Oh, my God. You're...

207
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:27,692
How...

208
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:29,151
You're okay.

209
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:31,372
Have we met?

210
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:33,130
I was one of your doctors.

211
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:36,081
You were in a vegetative
state when you left here last week.

212
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:37,371
Addison's disease.

213
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:43,051
All I needed was cortisol
and my brain turned on like a switch.

214
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:45,202
- This is amazing.
- Surprised

215
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:48,132
- you didn't know.
- How would I know?

216
00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:49,950
Not quite my old self yet.

217
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:54,381
- Baby steps, the doctors tell me.
- With rehab, you'll do great.

218
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:56,381
What hospital did you go to?

219
00:15:56,595 --> 00:15:59,280
- How would I...
- I wanna have sex with my wife.

220
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:01,822
And I was hoping that maybe...

221
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:03,850
- You could...
- Viagra?

222
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:08,033
- You're here for Viagra?
- A bucketful would be nice.

223
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:12,532
Dr. Cuddy.

224
00:16:20,998 --> 00:16:24,230
- It's completely unethical.
- He was reckless with a patient.

225
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,242
- He was right.
- But he didn't know that.

226
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:28,443
He needs at least
some glimmer of humility.

227
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,201
Why does he need that?
Because other people have that?

228
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:33,631
Why does he need
to be like other people?

229
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:36,282
- He needs to be less reckless.
- Well, you did it.

230
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:40,242
He's dismissing symptoms, looking
for easy solutions. He's in pain.

231
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:42,643
- How much pain?
- Why?

232
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,732
You know this is affecting him,
don't you?

233
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:53,220
Telling him that he got his last case
right won't do anything to help him.

234
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:55,820
- It'll make him less depressed.
- Which might not help his leg.

235
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,101
But you don't know.

236
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:00,050
Just let me run a PET scan

237
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,153
on  his parietal thalamic
area to see if it's sensing pain.

238
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:07,423
If it is, the Ketamine isn't working any-
more and he's headed for a huge crash.

239
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:10,140
If it's not, the leg pain is my fault

240
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,450
and I will tell him the truth.

241
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:20,040
Too tight?

242
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:24,010
- My parents think I'm crazy.
- No, they don't.

243
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:26,202
They're just worried about you,
that's all.

244
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,211
I'm not weird.

245
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:30,651
It's just that weird
things keep happening to me.

246
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:31,973
Slight pinch.

247
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:36,393
If you make me better,

248
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:39,041
do you think the aliens
will leave me alone?

249
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:41,961
I don't think they're gonna
be bothering you for much longer.

250
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:43,461
- You lying again?
- No.

251
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,251
We figure this out,
everything's gonna be okay.

252
00:17:57,628 --> 00:17:58,571
You still with us?

253
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:11,051
Pulmonary edema,
stage two hypertensive crisis.

254
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:12,890
- What is happening?
- Wait outside.

255
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:15,932
Get him oxygen. Start him on
an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.

256
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,881
Get them outside!

257
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:20,773
He's in ICU.
Systolic is hovering around 170.

258
00:18:21,157 --> 00:18:24,870
I left instructions to lower it slowly so
we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.

259
00:18:24,877 --> 00:18:28,060
The trade-off being that leaving his
blood pressure that high risks stroke,

260
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,673
- M. I., and blindness.
- I'm open to suggestions.

261
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:32,212
Solve the case.

262
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,691
- Kidneys could explain...
- Kidneys are clean.

263
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:38,811
Tell me he's a mutant/human hybrid.

264
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:42,422
It is a bleeding disorder. Clancy
tested positive for Von Willebrand's.

265
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:45,073
I didn't screw up.

266
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:48,223
How could he clot on his
own two out of three times?

267
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:53,450
- Maybe he cheated.
- Right.

268
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:56,160
Kids always cheat on
their bleeding time tests.

269
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:59,113
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.

270
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:03,151
I have no idea what you meant, but
I could smell what the Rock was cooking.

271
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:06,410
I meant he's clotting right
now and he's in hypertensive crisis.

272
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:08,141
Maybe the two are related.

273
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:10,920
What if he was hypertensive
the other two times that he clotted?

274
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:13,591
Hypertensive crisis can
activate clotting factors.

275
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:17,060
Someone low on Von Willebrands
could theoretically clot.

276
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:20,230
And the first time Clancy clotted,
he was all worked up recounting

277
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:22,901
his alien abduction.
He could have easily been hypertensive.

278
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:26,282
I know I get worked up when I cut micro-
chip tracking implants out of my neck.

279
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,843
- Sounds like a cheat to me.
- Yeah, we get it.

280
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:32,270
Okay, what's the differential
for seven-year-old boys

281
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:34,270
suffering multiple hypertensive crises?

282
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,951
We think the problem
is in your son's heart.

283
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,551
We need to do a procedure
called a transesophegeal echo.

284
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:46,702
Okay, and that will fix his heart?

285
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:49,312
That will tell us where the problem is.
Hopefully.

286
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:51,071
Then we can fix him.

287
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:01,332
Listen...

288
00:20:02,196 --> 00:20:04,242
this isn't really part of my job, but...

289
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:07,501
he's worried that you think he's crazy.

290
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:09,420
Well, isn't he?

291
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:14,033
There are still plenty of other
explanations for what's going on.

292
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:16,970
It's important he
knows you believe in him.

293
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,563
Even if you don't.

294
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,051
It's clean. His heart isn't the problem.

295
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:30,550
Why don't I have a hi-def in my office?

296
00:20:30,828 --> 00:20:31,972
I'm a department head.

297
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:35,251
- There are no structural defects.
- Valves are intact.

298
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:39,103
Tissue characterization is impossible
when the pixels are the size of Legos.

299
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:43,662
See, this is what I'm talking about.

300
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,391
Foreman, you gotta
steal this thing for me.

301
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:48,093
Let me ring up one of the homies.

302
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:50,893
The clearer the image, the
clearer it is that there are no masses,

303
00:20:50,908 --> 00:20:53,902
no clots, no tears.
The problem's got to be somewhere else.

304
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:57,471
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

305
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:06,251
You're wrong, House.

306
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:10,022
Think he'll make us break
into the IMAX before he admits it?

307
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:11,500
- There.
- Where?

308
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:14,132
Right there. Left side. No movement.

309
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:17,591
Well, don't freeze it.

310
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:22,282
Something's not moving. How do you see
something not move if nothing's moving?

311
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:23,483
I need a laser pointer.

312
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:26,472
- We don't have a laser pointer.
- Well, why not?

313
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:29,710
Who's gonna take us seriously
if we don't have a laser pointer?

314
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:31,081
Right...

315
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:32,892
here.

316
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:36,951
A few thousand myocytes
not beating with the rest.

317
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:38,553
So you found an arrhythmia.

318
00:21:39,387 --> 00:21:41,780
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhythmia.

319
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:44,160
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.

320
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:47,761
Go get me those myocytes.
I want to talk to them in my office.

321
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:53,402
How's the kid doing?

322
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,090
Heart nearly exploded.

323
00:21:57,175 --> 00:21:58,321
Still beating, though.

324
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,152
Most of it anyway.

325
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,760
Why do they bother putting
age restrictions on these things

326
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:07,211
when all you have to
do is click "Yes, I am 18"?

327
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:09,633
Even a 17-year-old can figure that out.

328
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:12,182
What's going on with the leg?

329
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:15,673
First tell me what's
going on with the boobs.

330
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:18,022
- If you're feeling pain...
- They're firmer.

331
00:22:18,466 --> 00:22:19,810
It's called an underwire.

332
00:22:20,946 --> 00:22:23,953
- I wanna get a PET scan of your brain.
- I think it's hormones.

333
00:22:23,955 --> 00:22:26,443
As long as there's no increased
activity in the thalamus--

334
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:29,422
Looks to me like those puppies
are going into the dairy business.

335
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:33,380
Then the pain can be good.
It could be muscle regenerating.

336
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:37,361
After you work out, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the Ketamine failed.

337
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:39,163
Guess I should be saying mazel tov.

338
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:42,163
- Who gets to pass out the cigars?
- I'm not pregnant.

339
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:43,873
I need to get a PET scan of your brain.

340
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:45,442
Boy or girl? You got a name picked out?

341
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,162
- I'm not pregnant.
- My leg doesn't hurt.

342
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:48,931
- You're in denial.
- No, I'm not!

343
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:51,003
Oh, you got me.

344
00:22:58,498 --> 00:23:00,691
If I thought that
my leg was deteriorating,

345
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:04,221
Don't you think I'd want
to take steps to prevent that?

346
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:07,722
Okay.

347
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:12,152
Gotta go.

348
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:25,560
Here's Clancy's DNA.

349
00:23:27,587 --> 00:23:30,882
And here's the DNA from that
piece of his heart we just biopsied.

350
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:37,641
That is impossible.

351
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:42,472
- Run it again.
- We already did.

352
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:44,720
And once more after that.

353
00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:50,130
The genes from Clancy's myocytes don't
match the genes from the rest of his body.

354
00:23:51,415 --> 00:23:52,591
Alien DNA.

355
00:24:00,015 --> 00:24:02,360
Anybody watch any X-Files
that inspired an explanation?

356
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:07,600
There are ways DNA can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.

357
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,253
That much sun, he'd be
dying with a healthy bronze glow.

358
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:13,650
Nitrous acid or ethidium
bromide exposure.

359
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:15,980
First daddy was a rapist,
now he's a chemist.

360
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:18,613
Various species of fungus
have been proven mutagenic.

361
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:22,762
Not unless the kid's been eating barrels
of celery or living in Indonesia or both.

362
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,900
- Is your leg hurting?
- Is that question helping?

363
00:24:24,915 --> 00:24:26,321
- You're leaning.
- You're sitting.

364
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,103
- You're evading.
- My head's hurting.

365
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:31,631
Please,  someone give me a plausible,

366
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:34,862
terrestrial explanation
for this kid's alien DNA.

367
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:38,250
We could search his home for toxins,
fungals, and radiation.

368
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:39,791
Who cares what caused it?

369
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:41,411
A kid comes in with a strep,

370
00:24:41,425 --> 00:24:44,890
we don't conduct a search to see which
classmate he got it from, we cure it.

371
00:24:44,898 --> 00:24:47,653
We know he's got this inside him.
Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.

372
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:49,910
Where do we cut?
Chances are it's not just in his heart.

373
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:51,261
We got lucky with the heart.

374
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:54,260
Myocytes contract,
we could see that these weren't working.

375
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:57,702
I don't know how the hell
we're gonna find it anywhere else.

376
00:24:59,938 --> 00:25:03,231
What if we take the heart cells
with the bad DNA and we tag them?

377
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:07,671
Can you phrase that
in the form of a metaphor?

378
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:09,671
It's the same way we search for cancer.

379
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:12,953
The bad DNA creates a unique protein
on the surface of the affected cells.

380
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:15,662
We create an antibody that
recognizes only that protein.

381
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:19,311
We flush it throughout his system
and the similar cells light up like...

382
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:21,083
lightbulbs.

383
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:24,761
Okay. Let's do that.

384
00:25:36,475 --> 00:25:38,920
- You have to tell him.
- He said he wasn't in any pain.

385
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,882
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.

386
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:43,923
- We need another plan.
- Don't talk about it that way.

387
00:25:43,928 --> 00:25:44,872
What way?

388
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:46,510
Plan.

389
00:25:46,707 --> 00:25:48,550
Sounds like we're
conspiring against him.

390
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:50,332
- I'm gonna tell him.
- No, you're not.

391
00:25:50,338 --> 00:25:52,490
Then come up with
a cunning plan and fast.

392
00:25:57,785 --> 00:26:00,431
She's not nearly as delightful
as she thinks she is.

393
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:03,521
What's this machine do?

394
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:06,343
It makes a lot of noise.

395
00:26:07,305 --> 00:26:10,063
And it's gonna help us
figure out what's wrong with you.

396
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,710
You think House has lost a step?

397
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:13,232
He's fine.

398
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:16,692
There,

399
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:19,550
a clump of affected cells
in the bone marrow of the femur.

400
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:21,301
Explains the intermittent
bleeding disorder.

401
00:26:21,308 --> 00:26:24,921
'Cause I don't need to subject myself
to House's torture if there's no upside.

402
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:26,541
I'm telling you, he's fine.

403
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:31,980
We missed some affected
cells in his heart.

404
00:26:31,986 --> 00:26:34,230
Explains the continuing
hypertensive issues.

405
00:26:34,355 --> 00:26:37,251
You said the last case really threw him.
And now suddenly...

406
00:26:37,258 --> 00:26:38,202
I was wrong.

407
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,053
So you changed your mind.

408
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:41,882
Why?

409
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:45,860
His brilliant ideas on
this case have all been yours.

410
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,051
There's the reason
for him needing glasses.

411
00:26:49,378 --> 00:26:52,273
Apparently it's a symptom.
Means the condition predates--

412
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:54,702
You don't change your
mind without a reason.

413
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:56,083
What do you know?

414
00:26:58,876 --> 00:26:59,823
House...

415
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:02,851
didn't blow the last case.

416
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:06,640
Cuddy cured the guy using House's idea.

417
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:10,553
Cuddy and Wilson are trying
to teach him some humility.

418
00:27:14,037 --> 00:27:17,082
Scan is complete. Three hot spots,
but nothing in his brain.

419
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:19,433
House's original theory was right.

420
00:27:20,187 --> 00:27:21,463
It is not neurological.

421
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:24,831
Is he gonna be able to walk?

422
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:27,411
His leg should be
functional after some rehab.

423
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:32,481
Functional? What does that mean?
He's be able to walk but not run?

424
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:33,892
He'll have a limp?

425
00:27:34,187 --> 00:27:36,651
If everything goes well,
he'll walk, he'll run.

426
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:39,162
He'll probably be even
stronger than he is now.

427
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:43,871
When we close him up,
we'll move over to his other leg.

428
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:47,223
Snake a catheter up through
the femoral artery and into his heart.

429
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:52,473
Once the affected areas are removed,
his normal tissue will set back in

430
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:55,952
and do its job. He should have no
more problems with his blood pressure.

431
00:27:55,955 --> 00:27:59,601
After confirming those areas are clear,
we'll start the final procedure.

432
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:02,373
I'm gonna insert a
needle through the pupil

433
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:04,833
and get rid of the abnormal
cells in the retina.

434
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:15,521
Close your right eye.

435
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:17,583
Can you see my face?

436
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:19,563
Yeah. It's clear.

437
00:28:19,817 --> 00:28:22,211
You can throw away your glasses.
We got it all.

438
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:23,930
Get some sleep.

439
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,102
You're going home tomorrow.

440
00:28:27,195 --> 00:28:28,141
Thank you.

441
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,621
You wanna go for a run?

442
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:44,900
What do you want?

443
00:28:45,466 --> 00:28:46,410
I want you to run.

444
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:54,093
When did you become an enabler?

445
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,460
I'm enabling you to exercise.

446
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:59,522
Vicodin blocks the pain,
you get through your rehab.

447
00:28:59,525 --> 00:29:01,832
Muscle strength increases,
and pain decreases.

448
00:29:01,848 --> 00:29:05,290
I'd rather not become dependent
on pain pills to get through my day.

449
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:10,001
You're just like any other patient.

450
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:13,340
Running away from knowledge
that won't make you happy.

451
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:15,332
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.

452
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:18,323
You're scared the Ketamine
treatment's wearing off.

453
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:19,520
That it was just a....

454
00:29:19,828 --> 00:29:21,572
torturous window to the good life.

455
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:23,901
What part of poop didn't you understand?

456
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:26,842
How can you be so sure
it isn't just a sore muscle?

457
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,211
It's my leg.

458
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,863
We've known each other a long time.

459
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,400
You're not always right, House.

460
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:38,570
You've proven that lately.

461
00:31:17,148 --> 00:31:19,900
- What's happening to him?
- He's seizing. I need clonazepam.

462
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:20,883
I thought you got it all!

463
00:31:20,886 --> 00:31:22,830
Yeah, yell at me. That'll fix the kid.

464
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,233
Obviously we missed some foreign tissue.
There's something still in him.

465
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:33,831
The hallucinations and seizures
indicate problems in the temporal lobe.

466
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:36,173
Sorry, House, it is neurological.

467
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:38,411
Looks like you were wrong, again.

468
00:31:38,486 --> 00:31:39,733
We didn't miss anything.

469
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,043
The brain scan was completely clean.

470
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:49,981
Our tag must not have penetrated
the blood brain barrier.

471
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:53,862
Don't use an IV this time,
get it right into the brain.

472
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:05,142
No cells are lighting up.

473
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:06,730
His brain is clean.

474
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:08,901
It is not neurological.

475
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:14,611
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.

476
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:16,122
His scan was clean twice.

477
00:32:16,876 --> 00:32:18,101
It's not there.

478
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:24,093
What if it is there,
but didn't show up on the scan?

479
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:26,493
What if the tag just
doesn't work in his brain?

480
00:32:26,716 --> 00:32:30,121
Brain cells are structurally different.
They express a different protein.

481
00:32:30,127 --> 00:32:32,030
So how do we find it?

482
00:32:36,805 --> 00:32:37,800
Where are we going?

483
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:39,881
I am going to think.

484
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:18,021
Send the kid home.

485
00:33:19,176 --> 00:33:20,122
What do you mean?

486
00:33:20,987 --> 00:33:24,080
Make sure his blood pressure
is stabilized and send him home.

487
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:28,372
- Like nothing ever happened?
- We cured his bleeding disorder

488
00:33:29,597 --> 00:33:31,961
and removed all the
damaged cells we could find.

489
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,593
We don't know that we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.

490
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,282
Maybe these symptoms come
and go like the blood disorder.

491
00:33:37,297 --> 00:33:39,841
It's more probable that
his remaining symptoms are

492
00:33:41,177 --> 00:33:42,121
just a nightmare.

493
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:43,983
He had a convulsion.

494
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:46,053
Maybe epilepsy, maybe psychological.

495
00:33:46,518 --> 00:33:47,461
Maybe nothing.

496
00:33:48,265 --> 00:33:49,663
If the kid gets sick again,

497
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:53,641
that'll give us another clue and we'll
start searching again. If he doesn't,

498
00:33:54,077 --> 00:33:55,023
it doesn't matter.

499
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:57,183
Send him home.

500
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:06,130
House!

501
00:34:09,785 --> 00:34:11,532
You're just giving up on this kid?

502
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:15,010
You gotta know when to stop.

503
00:34:15,415 --> 00:34:16,662
You don't stop.

504
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:20,691
You never stop, you just keep on going
until you come up with something so

505
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:22,933
insane that it's usually right.

506
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:24,971
Except on my last case.

507
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:27,533
Don't be pathetic.

508
00:34:28,305 --> 00:34:29,713
Just forget the last case.

509
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:33,491
This kid obviously has
something wrong with him.

510
00:34:35,348 --> 00:34:38,392
When did you develop such
strong opinions about my patients?

511
00:34:38,998 --> 00:34:41,251
Last week you were convinced
that my patient wasn't sick.

512
00:34:41,256 --> 00:34:44,451
- Now you're convinced this one is.
- This one is a young boy.

513
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:46,103
His parents are desperate.

514
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:50,520
Just get together with your team,
spend a few extra hours...

515
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:54,320
Well, I guess we could amputate his left
leg. It's where we found most of it.

516
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:56,693
Maybe we should just remove
his affected eye completely.

517
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:59,393
If you have reason to
believe that that might help...

518
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,892
I'm not gonna start
lopping off body parts.

519
00:35:03,418 --> 00:35:05,932
But it's interesting that
you give me the green light.

520
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:07,582
I just want you to do something.

521
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:11,073
You've been overly
supportive this entire week.

522
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:14,812
Well, either you're hormonal
or you're guilt-ridden.

523
00:35:15,886 --> 00:35:18,252
And it's too early in the
pregnancy for this to be hormonal.

524
00:35:18,255 --> 00:35:20,800
- I'm not pregnant.
- Then what did you do wrong?

525
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:30,523
He had Addison's.

526
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:33,482
Your last patient. You were right.

527
00:35:35,997 --> 00:35:39,703
I gave him one shot of cortisol
and he woke up like Rip Van Winkle.

528
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:46,742
Oh, your mommy's in such trouble.

529
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,420
She's such a liar.

530
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:52,423
That's why you don't have a daddy.
That's why she had to...

531
00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:02,103
How does one person...

532
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,181
end up with two different sets of DNA?

533
00:36:06,238 --> 00:36:09,132
- We've been through this.
- Our assumptions are faulty.

534
00:36:09,348 --> 00:36:12,400
We've confirmed two different
sets of DNA. We re-ran the sequence.

535
00:36:12,408 --> 00:36:16,102
I didn't say the lab work was faulty,
I said our assumptions were faulty.

536
00:36:16,115 --> 00:36:17,410
We assumed he's a person.

537
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:19,082
Of course.

538
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:21,793
The aliens didn't just visit him,
they replaced him.

539
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:23,423
You're being silly.

540
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,890
What if he's not a person?
What if he's two persons?

541
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,172
- I'm not getting the metaphor.
- No metaphor.

542
00:36:29,177 --> 00:36:32,340
Chase said the mom used
in vitro fertilization, right?

543
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:35,691
- Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.
- Kid was right all along.

544
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:37,342
He was implanted with something.

545
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:41,230
Back when he was young. I mean,
really young. Like 12 cells young.

546
00:36:41,648 --> 00:36:43,990
In vitro increases
the likelihood of twinning.

547
00:36:44,165 --> 00:36:45,540
But he doesn't have a twin.

548
00:36:45,545 --> 00:36:46,641
Not walking around...

549
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,253
But in vitro fertilization
costs around 25 grand a pop.

550
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:53,910
So doctors implant two to six embryos
to make sure you get your money's worth.

551
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:57,510
The problem is, there's not always
enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.

552
00:36:57,668 --> 00:37:00,031
Two brothers get stuck sharing,
but there's no bunk beds.

553
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:02,830
So they cuddle up to keep
warm and they never untangle.

554
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,470
He's two people in one.

555
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:08,912
It's called chimerism.

556
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,031
Unfortunately, his brother's...

557
00:37:13,617 --> 00:37:15,662
like a bad doubles partner.

558
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:18,891
The guy just takes up space,
gets in the way.

559
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:23,290
Clancy's body thinks he's gonna put
away the easy winners, his brother just

560
00:37:23,397 --> 00:37:25,341
keeps swatting the balls into the net.

561
00:37:26,186 --> 00:37:27,780
We gotta get him off the court.

562
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:32,991
So does that mean that you can
find the bad cells in his brain or not?

563
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:36,773
Sure, abandon the metaphor. Fine.

564
00:37:38,886 --> 00:37:41,980
Clancy thinks differently
than his brother because he thinks.

565
00:37:42,998 --> 00:37:44,743
If we induce an alien abduction...

566
00:37:44,856 --> 00:37:46,621
Wait, what the hell
are you talking about?

567
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:49,663
The foreign DNA has got to
be in the portion of your son's brain

568
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,810
that makes him believe
that he's being abducted.

569
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:54,490
If we stimulate those
neurons with an electric probe,

570
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:56,991
we can trick your son's
brain into hallucinating.

571
00:37:57,095 --> 00:37:58,791
Your son's neurons will light up,

572
00:37:58,836 --> 00:38:01,110
and his brother's
cells will remain dark.

573
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:03,722
Those are the ones we cut out.

574
00:38:04,046 --> 00:38:05,843
You're talking about brain surgery.

575
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,732
I'm talking about really
cool brain surgery.

576
00:38:09,545 --> 00:38:10,891
One of your sons will die.

577
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,740
But the taller one won't
be so annoying anymore.

578
00:38:15,516 --> 00:38:18,121
- So I have a twin?
- Not really.

579
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:19,762
What's on the card?

580
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:21,122
Light bulb.

581
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:22,371
Start us out at ten.

582
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:29,770
I'm not doing that.

583
00:38:30,145 --> 00:38:31,652
It was all me, kid. Sorry.

584
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:33,292
You're in motor function.

585
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:35,152
Try two centimeters back.

586
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,271
- He lives inside me.
- Sort of.

587
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:43,093
That tickles. Stop tickling my feet.

588
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:45,472
You're in sensory. Getting closer.

589
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:48,603
- What do you see on this one?
- Moon and stars.

590
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:51,882
So...

591
00:38:52,306 --> 00:38:53,613
I am kind of weird?

592
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:55,872
We're all kind of weird.

593
00:39:00,095 --> 00:39:01,080
No!

594
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:03,841
- Clancy?
- We got something.

595
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:05,492
- What do you see?
- The light.

596
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:06,821
Here they come.

597
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:08,281
I think.

598
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:11,883
Brain waves indicate mild hallucination.
Neurons are lighting up.

599
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:13,833
- Any dark spots?
- Area's too fuzzy.

600
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,870
Hallucination isn't strong enough.

601
00:39:15,877 --> 00:39:16,821
Turn up the juice.

602
00:39:19,177 --> 00:39:22,280
His blood pressure's already
at 160 over 110. Any higher and...

603
00:39:22,285 --> 00:39:24,771
Riding the short bus
is better than not breathing.

604
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:25,722
Take us to 100.

605
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,250
Area's still too fuzzy
to make any kind of distinction.

606
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:35,263
Crank it up higher.

607
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:37,733
You've already exceeded
the pre-set maximum.

608
00:39:38,036 --> 00:39:39,332
Next step's brain damage.

609
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,163
They're gonna get you.

610
00:39:49,558 --> 00:39:51,252
They're coming through the walls.

611
00:39:51,377 --> 00:39:53,222
They're gonna take you, torture you.

612
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:55,850
You'll never see your parents again.

613
00:40:18,348 --> 00:40:19,291
Clancy,

614
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:21,383
can you hear me?

615
00:40:22,907 --> 00:40:23,950
Clancy?

616
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:30,602
You got them.

617
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:38,090
We got 'em all.

618
00:40:39,197 --> 00:40:40,413
Close him up.

619
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,303
Everything's gonna be normal again.

620
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,190
You believe what Cuddy tried to pull?

621
00:40:58,815 --> 00:40:59,853
What now?

622
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:01,572
She lied to me.

623
00:41:02,188 --> 00:41:05,541
She cured my patient with my diagnosis,
then she lied to me about it.

624
00:41:06,118 --> 00:41:08,511
- That doesn't sound like her.
- You're right.

625
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:11,931
Does sound like you, though.

626
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:18,391
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?

627
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:22,071
Nothing that your body language
isn't telling me right now.

628
00:41:25,098 --> 00:41:26,311
So what was the plan?

629
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,450
I'd feel so humbled

630
00:41:30,525 --> 00:41:31,871
by missing a case that I'd

631
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:36,231
re-evaluate my entire life, question
the nature of truth and goodness,

632
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,660
- and become Cameron?
- Something like that.

633
00:41:40,258 --> 00:41:42,053
More that if we told you the truth,

634
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:46,330
that you'd solved a case based
on absolutely no medical proof,

635
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,632
you'd think you were God.

636
00:41:50,678 --> 00:41:53,532
And I was worried your wings would melt.

637
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:58,491
God doesn't limp.

638
10:00:00,000 --> 10:00:01,000
