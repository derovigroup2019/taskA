1
00:00:11,938 --> 00:00:14,038
You're not gonna make this easy,
are you?

2
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:17,489
Unfortunately,
as much as I admire your spirit...

3
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:22,416
Ca ne change rien.

4
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:37,686
Subject anesthetized with
0.5 cc's of sodium pentobarbital.

5
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:41,061
Transfected with human
hepatic cancer cells,

6
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,692
underwent six rounds of
intra-abdominal treatment with ES-22.

7
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:52,146
Vertical incision
through the rectus sheath

8
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:54,434
opens the abdominal cavity.

9
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:58,586
Incision extended into the-thorax.

10
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:08,412
Liver appears normal in color.
No apparent scarring or...

11
00:01:10,832 --> 00:01:11,789
Damn it!

12
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,033
Cancerous tumor still
present on the right lobe.

13
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:21,013
1.12 centimeters in diameter.

14
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:22,973
No reduction.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
House S03E03
Informed Consent

16
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:40,893
71 years old,
cancer research specialist.

17
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,401
Minor tremors,

18
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:46,743
localized melanoma removed two years
ago, cataracts. And he can't breathe.

19
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,000
Also, disregard the facial lacerations.

20
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:51,800
They're creepy,
but unfortunately irrelevant.

21
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:54,331
Don't you want to know why?

22
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:55,363
You have your cane.

23
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:57,650
No, why the lacerations are creepy.

24
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:01,110
He was about to dissect one
of his lab rats when he collapsed.

25
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:04,963
The little vermin seized the day, so
to speak, and went medieval on his ass.

26
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:10,070
- What? My fly open?
- So the pain's returned.

27
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:12,583
There was no pain, he was unconscious.

28
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm guessing because
he wasn't able to breathe.

29
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:17,563
- We're talking about you.
- Obviously. I'm obviously not.

30
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:20,761
What is it with you people?
I don't use the cane, you're shocked.

31
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:22,702
- I use the cane...
- We're just concerned.

32
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:24,813
About the wrong person. I can breathe.

33
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:27,000
Ezra Powell,
on the other hand, is gonna die.

34
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,711
- The Ezra Powell?
- Researcher?

35
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:31,890
- The guy who wrote that textbook?
- Not that textbook, the textbook.

36
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:34,193
Wait. There's actually
another doctor you admire?

37
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:35,932
I admire lots of doctors.

38
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:39,982
Of course, most of them look a lot
better in knee socks than Ezra Powell,

39
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,591
but seeing as they can all breathe...

40
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,802
Oxygenation is through the floor,
and lungs are full of fluid.

41
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:46,902
Gotta be his heart.
Could be amyloidosis.

42
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,742
Or his lungs, probably from years
of inhaling toxic chemicals in his lab.

43
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:54,490
- Not the lungs, chest x-ray's clean.
- So's his EKG, it's not his heart.

44
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:55,600
We're being too nice!

45
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,321
Outside the hospital, he can't breathe,
inside the hospital, he can.

46
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:03,542
Because we help. At least,
enough to screw with our test results.

47
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:06,442
Source of the problem's
either in his heart or his lungs.

48
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:08,962
So all we gotta do is stop helping.

49
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:11,571
Put a little pressure on him,
and see which gives out first.

50
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:14,160
At 71, we get his heart
or lungs to give out,

51
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:15,852
we might not get 'em to give in again.

52
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,770
That's why we're gonna
do it in a hospital.

53
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:20,473
Put him on an incline treadmill,
and do a stress EKG.

54
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:24,480
So much for the admiration.

55
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,013
Let's get you started.

56
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:29,363
I'll turn your oxygen up.

57
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:35,350
I-I worked with Williams on the

58
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:37,773
first protocol for this machine.

59
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,643
Everyone still uses it.

60
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:40,971
Except for Williams.

61
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:42,823
He died four years ago.

62
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:44,581
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:46,443
He was 84.

64
00:04:46,806 --> 00:04:47,933
He died parasailing.

65
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:51,451
He was always an idiot.

66
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:55,250
You okay?

67
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:59,132
Hang in there, you know
the protocol's only a few minutes.

68
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:02,123
His heart rate's flat.

69
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:04,481
We don't get it past 130,
we're not gonna see anything.

70
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:07,283
And if he falls and breaks a hip,
we're not gonna see anything either.

71
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:09,711
Except an increase in
our malpractice insurance.

72
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:14,640
I figured House might
go back to the pills, but

73
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:17,972
if he's using his cane,
he's right back to where he was before.

74
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:18,950
Maybe even worse.

75
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:21,950
Luckily, he'll handle it in a stoic,
grown-up fashion.

76
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,850
He'd never take it out on us.

77
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:30,390
I can't.

78
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:32,340
I've-- I gotta stop.

79
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:34,391
Just a little longer.

80
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:42,543
Heart rate's only 90,
I'm gonna increase the incline.

81
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:46,972
I  gotta stop.

82
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:48,253
I- I've gotta get off.

83
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:50,890
You're doing great,
just a little faster, okay?

84
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:52,441
I-- I don't need a cheerleader,

85
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:53,740
I need oxygen.

86
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:56,791
Stop. This isn't working.

87
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,790
His heart rate barely got above 90.

88
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:07,561
He can't breathe,
there's too much fluid in his lungs.

89
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,513
Really?

90
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:11,441
He's got fluid in his lungs?
Whatever are we gonna do?

91
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:12,572
Oh, yeah, now I remember.

92
00:06:12,577 --> 00:06:15,370
Put him on a treadmill, and
run him like one of his rats on a wheel.

93
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,772
He can't run, he can hardly walk.

94
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:18,480
That's 'cause he's
not trying hard enough.

95
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:19,973
If he was, his heart rate would go up.

96
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:22,970
Exercising with a lungful of
your own bodily fluids tends to hurt.

97
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,953
They don't call it
a stress test for nothing.

98
00:06:24,956 --> 00:06:26,610
- Do it again.
- He's drowning!

99
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:29,770
Then pull him out of the pool,
and do it again.

100
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:38,370
I'm assuming this isn't
your idea of a long-term solution.

101
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:42,000
We need to get rid of the fluid in your
lungs so you'll be able to do the test.

102
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:43,861
To see if it's my heart or my lungs.

103
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:45,120
Exactly.

104
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:46,510
My money's on both.

105
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:50,781
I've been in and out of
the hospital for the past year.

106
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:52,932
I'm old, I'm sick.

107
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:54,992
I'm getting older, and sicker.

108
00:06:55,556 --> 00:06:58,192
Not a very interesting
differential, but--

109
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:01,503
I'm in.

110
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:13,512
You don't need a $400 handbag.

111
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:16,532
It's kinda hard to check your throat
when you're flapping your gums around.

112
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,481
Oh, sorry.

113
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:19,233
But it's for the fall formal.

114
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:23,230
He doesn't care if it's
for the presidential inauguration.

115
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:25,643
But I'm using Marissa's old dress.
It's free.

116
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,600
Yeah, you know what else is free?

117
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:31,070
Roof over your head, the food you eat,
your phone, your computer.

118
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:32,813
How long have you been congested?

119
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:34,842
A week, ever since
we got back from Fresno.

120
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:37,442
Fresno? That's in France, right?
See the Parthenon?

121
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:39,620
Uh, California.

122
00:07:40,656 --> 00:07:43,302
I've got no appetite,
I'm aching all over, I'm weak.

123
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:45,202
- Does that hurt?
- Oh, yeah.

124
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,463
Does his voice always have
that unattractive nasal tone?

125
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:51,712
Totally.

126
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:55,290
I'm gonna take that giggle as a no.

127
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:58,131
Fever,  aches,
weakness, loss of appetite.

128
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,401
Been having any anal
sex with IV drug users lately?

129
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:03,012
Of  course not, I'm married.

130
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:06,052
- Do you think he might've been--
- No!

131
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:08,741
It's probably a rhinovirus.

132
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,101
What's that?

133
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:11,431
Cold.

134
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:13,852
Take this four times a day,

135
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:15,992
and stay off airplanes.

136
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:17,642
They're flying cesspools.

137
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,480
You dropped something.

138
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,991
If there's anything else
you can think of, please call.

139
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:32,352
Yes?

140
00:08:32,357 --> 00:08:33,772
He's too old and weak.

141
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:47,233
Yeah, this is way, way better.
This'll work.

142
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:49,303
Please, just try.

143
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,513
There are 20 words to describe

144
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,399
chest pain.

145
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,463
Burning,

146
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:55,413
squeezing,

147
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:56,853
stabbing, tearing.

148
00:08:57,748 --> 00:08:59,363
Each one diagnostically useful.

149
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:03,002
For that, you have to thank Dr.
Powell's textbook.

150
00:09:03,597 --> 00:09:07,391
But there are no words to describe
degrees of what he's feeling right now--

151
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:08,552
shortness of breath.

152
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:12,492
If he had worked on those issues,
there would be.

153
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,971
'Cause he would never have
given up until he had an answer.

154
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:16,980
This isn't working.

155
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,383
Dr. House.

156
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:23,782
Please don't get up.

157
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:25,412
I'm sure you're very busy,

158
00:09:25,555 --> 00:09:28,151
so I'm just gonna try
and speed things up a little.

159
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:30,602
Is that epi? That's not the protocol.

160
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:33,552
No, the protocol is what
you tried to do and failed...

161
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:34,991
each time.

162
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:42,001
Up over 100.
Now we're getting somewhere.

163
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:43,240
How's it look, Foreman?

164
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:44,311
No EKG changes.

165
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:48,480
- Then we push harder.
- House, you're gonna kill him.

166
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:49,430
No, he's right!

167
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:50,883
Let him do it.

168
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:54,140
See? That's why he doesn't
have to wear knee socks.

169
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:55,091
He can't breathe.

170
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:00,893
130.

171
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:02,431
That's our magic number.

172
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:04,963
Nothing here. Foreman?

173
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,120
Still no sign of blockages.

174
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,251
Which means it's not the heart.

175
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,661
So it must be the lungs.

176
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:14,741
See? Wasn't so hard, was it?

177
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:20,272
No! Just give me the
rest of the epinephrine.

178
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,721
Test is over,
it's okay, we're gonna stabilize you.

179
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:23,673
No!

180
00:10:24,726 --> 00:10:26,542
No, just let me die.

181
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,213
- You're not gonna die.
- Yes, I am.

182
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:31,851
We'll find a treatment.

183
00:10:33,185 --> 00:10:35,062
I don't wanna live like this.

184
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:38,070
Please.

185
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:39,621
I'm begging you.

186
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:42,763
Kill me.

187
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:52,131
He says no more tests, he wants to
die and he wants us to help him do it.

188
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:55,630
And I want to play a little game I like
to call block my spike with misty may.

189
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:58,012
He's thought this through,
it's not an impulsive decision.

190
00:10:58,018 --> 00:10:59,861
Neither is mine. He's depressed.

191
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:01,681
He'll feel much better
after we cure him.

192
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:03,303
He's seen all the tests we've seen.

193
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:06,582
Even if we figure out what's causing the
lung damage, it's too late to reverse it.

194
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:08,622
You can't know that without
knowing what's wrong.

195
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,733
- It's his call.
- So, what do we do?

196
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,211
Put a plastic bag over
his head and get it over with?

197
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:15,571
No, we give him a
syringe full of morphine.

198
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:20,442
Every doctor I've ever
practiced with has done it.

199
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,211
They don't want to, they don't like to,
but that's the way it is.

200
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,170
I haven't, I won't.

201
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,193
I couldn't do it either.

202
00:11:26,195 --> 00:11:28,253
You just said we should
respect his decision.

203
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:30,701
Respect it doesn't
necessarily mean we honor it.

204
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:32,670
Right. It just means we talk about it.

205
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:37,232
At some point, "do no harm" has to
mean allowing nature to take its course,

206
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:39,002
not stubbornly standing
in the way of it.

207
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:42,691
Sticking a metal syringe into a plastic
IV line and pumping in a lethal dose

208
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:45,241
of morphine is not letting
nature take its course.

209
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,040
Not according to
the state of New Jersey.

210
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:49,892
So it's better we allow him
to slowly suffocate in his own plasma?

211
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:52,953
Whose side are you on, senator?
First respect his wishes,

212
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,373
then invade Iraq, then get
the troops home... make up your mind.

213
00:11:57,757 --> 00:12:00,043
Certainly a lot of interesting
things to consider.

214
00:12:00,046 --> 00:12:02,183
Stress EKG rules out the heart.

215
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:04,541
Which means something's gotta
be attacking his lungs.

216
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:06,600
Mycoplasma or strep pneumo.

217
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:09,352
The problem is,
it's too late to do anything about it.

218
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:13,461
- We could try levofloxacin.
- Coming up with a new treatment

219
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:16,930
isn't gonna do us any good unless
we convince him it's worth trying.

220
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:17,882
Come on,

221
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,353
he's old, sick, tiny.

222
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:22,700
We can do whatever we want to him.

223
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:33,933
What happened?

224
00:12:34,348 --> 00:12:35,293
I don't know.

225
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,601
He must've fallen out of
bed and got the nasal cannula

226
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:41,823
- wrapped around his neck somehow.
- Ezra, what are you doing?

227
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:44,552
I don't want to live hooked to machines.

228
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:46,860
Too we-- too weak to wipe my own ass.

229
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:50,250
Why would you want to wipe your own ass,
when you could have someone do it for you?

230
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:51,600
You're wasting your time.

231
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:54,142
There must be other patients
you could actually help.

232
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:57,540
No, all services rendered
on a first come, first served basis.

233
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:00,620
I won't consent to any more tests.

234
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:04,563
And if anyone tries
to so much as touch me,

235
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:07,271
I'll press charges for assault.

236
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:11,422
Okay, well, you heard the man.

237
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:13,332
He  wants everyone to leave him alone.

238
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:14,761
Why don't you go first?

239
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,612
Get out!

240
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:27,901
You came to me.

241
00:13:28,377 --> 00:13:29,473
I didn't come to you.

242
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:32,850
I figured you'd have the
guts to do what had to be done

243
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:34,523
if it came to that.

244
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:38,360
We're nowhere near that.
It's time to test your lungs.

245
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:44,951
Breathe.

246
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,022
You're gonna have to exhale sometime.

247
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:49,140
- Stop!
- House, you're hurting him.

248
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:50,451
And you're hurting me.

249
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:55,892
Fine.

250
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,382
You don't want to help us,
we don't help you.

251
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:02,821
Your lungs slowly fill with fluid.

252
00:14:03,238 --> 00:14:05,582
You gasp to catch every breath,
but never can.

253
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:08,152
Every breath is petrifying.

254
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:10,252
It'll be slow,

255
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:11,860
painful,

256
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,323
torturous.

257
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:16,763
We don't choose our birth.

258
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:19,443
And we don't choose our death.

259
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,013
What if you could?

260
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:25,360
How 'bout we make a deal?

261
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:27,983
You give me one more day.

262
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:32,260
If I don't find out exactly
what's wrong with you by then,

263
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:34,872
I'll help you die.

264
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:36,433
House.

265
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:38,673
24 hours.

266
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,591
C'mon, it's not gonna kill you.

267
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:53,612
Old guy, lungs, fluid, go.

268
00:14:53,837 --> 00:14:56,030
- You cannot help him kill himself.
- Of course I can,

269
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:57,483
Chase says we do it all the time.

270
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:59,492
- Cuddy's not gonna let you.
- Enough!

271
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:01,693
You don't want me to kill him, fine.

272
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:03,831
Here's a big shock.
I don't want to kill him either.

273
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:06,662
How  do I not kill him?
By you guys doing your job.

274
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:09,983
We have 24 hours to figure
out what's wrong with him.

275
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:12,243
Tick-tock, tick-tock!

276
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:14,972
I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia.
Should be bacteria in his blood.

277
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:17,840
- That's gonna take longer than 24h.
- Not if I spin down the sample.

278
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:20,793
Separate off the buffy coat,
then gram stain for bacteria.

279
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,822
Great, do an amylase, d-dimer,
c-reactive peptide, get a urine,

280
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:27,312
and do a bronchial
sputum while you're at it.

281
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:29,790
You, check his home and
lab for radiation and toxins.

282
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,740
- And do a bone marrow biopsy.
- All of that in 24 hours?

283
00:15:32,786 --> 00:15:36,080
Nah, whatever you don't get done,
you can finish at the autopsy.

284
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,540
You guys look like crap.

285
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,642
- What do you got?
- Purple dye on my fingers.

286
00:16:57,697 --> 00:17:00,240
- What'd the bone marrow biopsy show?
- Don't have the results.

287
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:02,251
What?
What have you been doing all night?

288
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,153
Jell-o shots and wild sex, what else?

289
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:06,221
There's no bacteria
in the blood cultures.

290
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:08,622
We still have some cooking,
but so far nothing.

291
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:09,671
Nothing in the urine.

292
00:17:09,677 --> 00:17:12,971
The lab was clean enough to
do surgery in because, well, they do.

293
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:16,020
There was no sign of viruses
or fleas on any of the rats.

294
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:17,193
Yeah?

295
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:19,981
Who?

296
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:22,451
Well, tell her to call a clinic.

297
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:26,013
Then tell her to leave a message,
and I'll get back to her.

298
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,312
Then tell her to leave
a personal message.

299
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:30,703
- Who's that?
- Your prot?g??

300
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:32,373
What are these?

301
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:34,602
Dictation tapes, he records everything.

302
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:35,261
Why?

303
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:38,531
- Because he's a diligent researcher?
- Or he's losing his memory.

304
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:39,932
Lot of people dictate their notes.

305
00:17:39,948 --> 00:17:42,511
Yes, we could assume that,
and we'd have nothing.

306
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,053
Or we could assume it's a symptom,
in which case,

307
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:47,353
whatever's in his lungs
is also in his brain.

308
00:17:47,787 --> 00:17:49,753
Unless you got something more promising.

309
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:53,192
- I'll go get an MRI of his head.
- Keep testing until you find something.

310
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,392
I'm going to my office
to rest for a while.

311
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:01,193
It's been a long time
since I took an anatomy class,

312
00:18:01,838 --> 00:18:05,530
but I'm pretty sure you're moving
farther and farther away from my lungs.

313
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:08,510
Running out of places to look,
aren't you?

314
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:10,581
Doesn't mean we're gonna stop looking.

315
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:12,831
Mm, no, not for six more hours.

316
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:14,633
- You want us to fail?
- No.

317
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:17,002
But you will.

318
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:28,840
No abnormal nuclei means no leukemia.

319
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:32,120
- He a drinker?
- Not according to the history.

320
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:33,452
Which means, yes, he drinks,

321
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,373
which gives us a nice, mundane
explanation for the acellularity.

322
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,463
Or he's telling the truth. Which
means fungus is still on the table.

323
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:42,113
But your entire view of
human nature gets destroyed.

324
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,402
Six of one, half a dozen of the other.

325
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,220
Bad news fast.
Good news, you can take your time.

326
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,993
Head's clean, you were wrong,
his faculties are intact.

327
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:52,941
Too bad.

328
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,830
If his brain was addled, we wouldn't
have to listen to anything he says.

329
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:57,192
Hand me the 10% KOH.

330
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,292
It's 4:00, we have nothing to tell him.

331
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:02,233
Then we have no reason to talk to him.
Still haven't ruled out fungus.

332
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:04,531
Yep, we have, no bugs, no hyphae.

333
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:08,723
Okay,

334
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:10,333
next procedure.

335
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:11,581
We sneak in,

336
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:13,023
turn back the clock.

337
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:19,782
Whole team.

338
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:22,960
- Must be bad news.
- Nope.

339
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:26,971
Bone marrow biopsy
revealed multiple myeloma.

340
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:30,903
It's not good news,
but there are some treatments.

341
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:33,631
- We have to draw some blood.
- What about my breathing?

342
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:37,852
Associated hyperviscosity syndrome gummed
up the blood vessels in your lungs.

343
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:41,283
Dr. Chase said my calcium is normal.

344
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:43,481
Mm, we call him Dr. Idiot.

345
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:46,202
There's no M protein in my urine.

346
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:47,641
Odd presentation.

347
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:52,230
So odd that Dr. Cameron doesn't--
doesn't believe it either.

348
00:19:57,627 --> 00:20:00,771
- Just give me 12 more hours.
- We had a deal. No more tests.

349
00:20:02,437 --> 00:20:03,382
Fair enough.

350
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:05,191
Gimme six more hours.

351
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:09,662
Listen, there is no evidence
that you are terminal.

352
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:11,250
You a man of your word or not?

353
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:13,350
No, as a matter of fact, I'm not.

354
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:14,420
Fine.

355
00:20:14,826 --> 00:20:15,770
Then discharge me.

356
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:19,920
My lungs will slowly fill with fluid.

357
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:23,102
I'll gasp to catch every breath.

358
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,881
But never can.

359
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:27,203
Every breath will be petrifying.

360
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:28,521
It'll be slow,

361
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:29,690
painful,

362
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:30,652
torturous.

363
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,112
You're  really gonna
let me die like that?

364
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,802
- Where you going?
- Nowhere!

365
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:37,731
Everybody who can walk
should get outta here.

366
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,403
- You can't do that.
- Can't do what?

367
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:45,390
Administer a prescription painkiller
to a patient who's in pain?

368
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:46,753
Go.

369
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:49,481
Make sure somebody sees
you downstairs in the cafeteria.

370
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:50,730
I can't let you do this.

371
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:55,112
Either I die in pain, or I just die.

372
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:56,603
That's

373
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:58,473
what the argument is here.

374
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:01,213
No, it's about whether you die,
or we murder you.

375
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:05,093
What's gonna happen here is that someone
is getting a buttload of morphine.

376
00:22:05,796 --> 00:22:07,791
I'm not sure exactly who at this point.

377
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:26,290
I can't be a part of this.

378
00:22:51,726 --> 00:22:52,672
Thank you.

379
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,443
I always wondered

380
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:00,193
exactly what was on the other side.

381
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:03,631
Nothing.

382
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:39,362
What are you doing?

383
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:41,500
Getting a laryngoscope.

384
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:48,062
- Don't just stand there, help.
- But you told him--

385
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:50,662
It was something I like to call a lie.
Bad, I know.

386
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:53,093
But it's way further
down the list than murder.

387
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:02,572
He's unconscious,

388
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:04,252
no more whining.

389
00:24:05,935 --> 00:24:06,922
Keep testing him.

390
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:11,330
Go get a ventilator.

391
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,660
I can't do this all night.

392
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:22,190
We can legally assume

393
00:24:22,197 --> 00:24:25,552
that he'd consent to whatever a
reasonable person would consent to.

394
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:29,233
And a reasonable person
would obviously consent

395
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:33,001
to being put in a coma against their
will just to satisfy your curiosity.

396
00:24:33,645 --> 00:24:35,190
I try to kill him, you're mad.

397
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:37,071
I don't kill him, you're mad.

398
00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:40,023
- All he wanted was some dignity.
- Were you in that room with him?

399
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:43,083
Was he wearing a tux while
he was choking on his own plasma?

400
00:24:43,408 --> 00:24:45,950
Keep doing the tests.
Take your time, do it right.

401
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:48,332
Go.

402
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:49,281
Get to work.

403
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:51,732
Wait!

404
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:59,533
Cameron, why'd you do these cuts
so far down on this MRI of his head?

405
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:01,491
I wanted to get his
brain stem and his c-spine,

406
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:03,353
make sure his diaphragm
wasn't paralyzed.

407
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:06,153
You also caught the top of his lungs.
There's scarring.

408
00:25:09,518 --> 00:25:12,223
You do know that you can't
really pierce me with your stares?

409
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:15,600
Lung scarring, along with the bad bone
marrow, points to an autoimmune disease.

410
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:17,801
- Could be pulmonary fibrosis.
- Or lupus.

411
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:19,913
He can kill himself
after we get him better.

412
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,852
Start him on an IVIG for the lupus,
and get a colonoscopy.

413
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,300
Lupus could be hiding there.

414
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:32,703
I can't do this.

415
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,060
Drama queen.

416
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:41,123
Descending colon's clean.

417
00:25:42,948 --> 00:25:44,193
Moving into the sigmoid.

418
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:48,311
Sure could use a little
more help around here.

419
00:25:48,457 --> 00:25:50,043
She's doing what she believes in.

420
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:53,741
Yeah, if she was acting on principle,
she'd be in here trying to stop us.

421
00:25:53,745 --> 00:25:56,521
All she's doing is running away
from the principle so she won't have

422
00:25:56,526 --> 00:25:59,480
- to feel uncomfortable facing it.
- And if you were acting on principle,

423
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:02,763
you would've called the cops when
you thought House was killing the guy.

424
00:26:02,926 --> 00:26:04,102
You better hurry up.

425
00:26:04,507 --> 00:26:05,450
Why?

426
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,350
I don't think she's gonna have
a problem deciding what to tell Cuddy.

427
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,772
O? sats 89 and dropping.

428
00:26:20,557 --> 00:26:23,110
I thought you were only supposed
to put on a pound a week during

429
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,291
- your last trimester.
- I'm not pregnant.

430
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:28,391
I heard about your little
stunt with Dr. Powell.

431
00:26:29,018 --> 00:26:32,040
Not really a stunt.
More of a trick, a ruse, a hoodwink.

432
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:33,352
- A lie.
- Okay.

433
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:35,793
Lying is sometimes good, right?

434
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:39,892
Like when you're trying to teach someone
a lesson about humility or something.

435
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,433
All I'm trying to do is save his life.

436
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:44,503
He's not gonna learn anything. I just
thought the same principle might apply.

437
00:26:44,507 --> 00:26:45,462
It does.

438
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:47,752
I could've just let him die.

439
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,941
Not gonna get sued
for keeping him alive.

440
00:26:49,947 --> 00:26:50,892
Well, we could.

441
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:53,142
We completely disregarded his wishes.

442
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:55,242
Do you want me to disagree with you?

443
00:26:55,368 --> 00:26:57,442
- Want me to yell at you?
- It is comforting.

444
00:26:57,445 --> 00:27:00,190
We're doctors.
We treat patients, we don't kill them.

445
00:27:02,117 --> 00:27:03,603
How right you are, Dr. Cuddy!

446
00:27:03,608 --> 00:27:06,703
We also don't pad our bills,
swipe samples from the pharmacy,

447
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:09,740
or fantasize about the teenage
daughters of our patients either.

448
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:12,431
True, better be true, and you're a pig.

449
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:16,562
I'm sorry about your leg.

450
00:27:17,477 --> 00:27:20,420
Yeah, we really should spend
some time talking about that.

451
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:23,823
The IVIG made him worse.
O? sats plummeted.

452
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:26,793
So we know it's not lupus.

453
00:27:27,718 --> 00:27:28,862
What else could it be?

454
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:30,600
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

455
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,421
Gonna need an open
lung biopsy to confirm.

456
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:37,222
So now we're gonna operate on the guy?

457
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:40,652
Unless you've invented a new
way of doing an open lung biopsy.

458
00:27:44,728 --> 00:27:46,812
When you searched Dr. Powell's office,

459
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:50,650
did you find a copy of the january
1967 Massachusetts medical journal?

460
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:51,833
Why?

461
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:54,133
I just figured,
if you're not doing any work,

462
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:56,471
you might like something
to pass the time.

463
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:57,781
Centerfold's a killer.

464
00:28:13,135 --> 00:28:14,082
How's your leg?

465
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:15,251
It hurts.

466
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,883
It's gonna keep on hurting.
You're gonna keep on asking?

467
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:18,840
How's Ezra Powell?

468
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,193
Resting comfortably.

469
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:24,613
Hmm, that's not what Cameron says.

470
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:27,080
I hate practicing
medicine in high school.

471
00:28:27,086 --> 00:28:30,731
He's not asking you to help him
kill himself. He's just asking for help.

472
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:33,860
- The disease will kill him.
- I know what he was asking for.

473
00:28:33,868 --> 00:28:36,043
- I just said no.
- You've done it before.

474
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:36,991
Plenty of times.

475
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,151
To patients that I knew were terminal.

476
00:28:39,357 --> 00:28:42,051
Oh, give me a break. This
has nothing to do with saving a life.

477
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,200
You just can't bear the
thought of a patient dying

478
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,120
before you've been
able to figure out why.

479
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:49,231
If we're gonna keep refusing
to cure patients just to rein in my ego,

480
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:52,071
then we might start to have a
little problem with patient recruitment.

481
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:54,723
Worried about meeting
your one patient a week quota?

482
00:28:55,657 --> 00:28:56,903
I'm a cripple, remember?

483
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,182
Accommodations must be made.

484
00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:10,423
Wedge of left lobe isolated

485
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:12,280
and removed.

486
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:15,510
Clamp.

487
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:21,190
Why'd you have me look up that article?

488
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:22,512
Didn't you find it interesting?

489
00:29:22,518 --> 00:29:25,502
He injected newborn babies
with radioactive agents just to see

490
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:27,903
- if they had urethral reflux.
- He was curious.

491
00:29:27,907 --> 00:29:30,380
He didn't even tell their
parents he was doing an experiment.

492
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:32,491
He wasn't doing anything
his peers weren't doing.

493
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:34,451
His peers at Tuskegee and Willowbrook?

494
00:29:34,715 --> 00:29:36,961
He ignored the rights
of a few to save many.

495
00:29:37,628 --> 00:29:39,270
So you're okay with what he did.

496
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:40,773
Doesn't matter what I think.

497
00:29:41,305 --> 00:29:43,151
It's what you think that's relevant.

498
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:47,362
Because if I think less of him,
I'll help you more?

499
00:29:50,337 --> 00:29:51,282
You're wrong.

500
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:55,210
The fact that a patient did
bad things doesn't change anything.

501
00:29:55,215 --> 00:29:58,113
He still deserves to have
some control over his own body.

502
00:29:58,137 --> 00:30:00,592
If he had control of his own body,
he'd be dead.

503
00:30:00,737 --> 00:30:03,902
Some control. We can withhold
treatment without killing him.

504
00:30:04,157 --> 00:30:05,283
No, you can't!

505
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:10,082
You either help him live, or you help
him die. You can't have it both ways.

506
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,623
I guess it's not IPF.

507
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:23,522
Or maybe he'll die right now,
and make everything easy for all of us.

508
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:30,251
- Heart rate's fast.
- BP's low.

509
00:30:33,516 --> 00:30:36,371
No breath sounds on the right side.
He's dropped his right lung.

510
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:39,123
Air's building up in his chest,
compressing his heart.

511
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:54,483
- Heart rate's decreasing.
- BP's stabilizing.

512
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:16,253
What are you doing?

513
00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:26,372
Withdraws from pain stimuli
on the left side, but not the right.

514
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:29,193
Those are just reflex arcs.
He's under anesthesia.

515
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,983
Or he's lost sensation in some places.

516
00:31:32,227 --> 00:31:34,742
Or the hypoxia from
the arrest stunned his CNS.

517
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:37,782
Only one way to tell.
Do somatosensory evoked potentials.

518
00:31:37,787 --> 00:31:39,733
We can't do that while he's in a coma.

519
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,012
Only two ways to tell. Get a hammer
and check his deep tendon reflexes.

520
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:47,163
Won't work. He needs muscle
relaxants to be on the ventilator.

521
00:31:47,368 --> 00:31:49,910
Only one more way to tell.
Pupillary reflexes.

522
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:51,622
All that tests is the brainstem.

523
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:53,412
See, I was right. Only one way to tell.

524
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:55,210
Do somatosensory evoked potentials.

525
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:57,483
I just said we can't
do that while he's in a coma.

526
00:31:57,488 --> 00:31:58,433
So wake him up.

527
00:32:13,187 --> 00:32:15,560
Don't go towards the light.

528
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:19,292
You'll fall and break your hip.

529
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:45,432
What's happening?

530
00:32:49,497 --> 00:32:50,640
You took a little nap.

531
00:32:52,578 --> 00:32:53,523
I know

532
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:55,640
I told you I didn't want--

533
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,721
Sorry, a little deaf in one ear.

534
00:32:58,616 --> 00:33:00,361
Your bone marrow was hypocellular.

535
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:03,612
Ruled out lupus and pulmonary fibrosis.

536
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:06,721
But it looks like it could
be attacking your nerves.

537
00:33:07,266 --> 00:33:08,460
So this is all a waste.

538
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:10,863
Huge failure.

539
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:13,843
Impossible.

540
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:15,983
You're Gregory House.

541
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:18,913
We need to attach some
sensors to your skin.

542
00:33:19,068 --> 00:33:21,703
- No.
- Look, we can't do what you want.

543
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:24,760
We've assigned a nurse to
watch you so you can't do it either.

544
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:26,561
So you might as well
just let us do the test.

545
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:29,882
- No, I want to be discharged.
- You can't be discharged.

546
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:32,643
- You've got two chest tubes in.
- Then take them out.

547
00:33:32,648 --> 00:33:36,131
Oh, get over yourself.
The ventilator puffed up your lungs.

548
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:39,131
You'll be fine for a few hours.
Just let us run the tests.

549
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:43,110
Okay.

550
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,842
But first, let's clean you up a little.

551
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:52,191
Does that feel nice?

552
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:54,550
- What are you trying to prove?
- Just cleaning him up.

553
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:55,750
What does it look like?

554
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,961
Pay no attention to
the man behind the curtain.

555
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:04,511
Get out!

556
00:34:05,447 --> 00:34:06,812
Okay, I'm going already.

557
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:09,232
Can't you see I'm a cripple?

558
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:14,302
- Okay, so you got me curious.
- I was right.

559
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:17,240
Whatever is attacking his
lungs is attacking his nerves.

560
00:34:17,248 --> 00:34:18,992
You got that by splashing
ice water on him?

561
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:23,000
No sensation in the left leg, abdomen,
right arm. Technology's overrated.

562
00:34:23,305 --> 00:34:25,863
That means the clean MRI of
his brain means it's just affecting

563
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:27,733
- the peripheral nerves.
- And bone marrow.

564
00:34:27,737 --> 00:34:29,542
Kawasaki's would explain
the kidney failure.

565
00:34:29,548 --> 00:34:31,442
- Or lymphoma.
- Or sarcoidosis.

566
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:33,960
All potentially treatable.
Question is which.

567
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:37,230
We need to catch the
little bastards in the act.

568
00:34:37,926 --> 00:34:39,773
- What's the largest organ?
- Skin.

569
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,113
We need to get a piece.

570
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:43,133
Sure, we'll just

571
00:34:43,195 --> 00:34:46,990
wait until he leaves his room without
his skin, sneak in, and take a piece.

572
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:50,500
I want you to get a
skin sample for a biopsy.

573
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,361
And I want to get a foot
massage from Johnny Damon.

574
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:57,383
Kawasaki's disease, lymphoma,
and sarcoidosis are all treatable.

575
00:34:57,605 --> 00:35:01,151
And it could be 100 other things
that aren't treatable. You've no idea.

576
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:02,111
But you do.

577
00:35:02,785 --> 00:35:03,723
You know everything.

578
00:35:03,738 --> 00:35:05,640
- I didn't say that I--
- Exactly!

579
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:09,130
You can't decide if we're
helping or hurting him.

580
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:10,393
If he's good or bad.

581
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,473
Or if you want paper,
plastic, or a burlap sack.

582
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:16,821
Do your damn job.

583
00:35:19,848 --> 00:35:21,143
I'm not gonna lie to him.

584
00:35:25,908 --> 00:35:27,073
Fine, tell the truth.

585
00:35:28,017 --> 00:35:29,511
Just get me a pound of flesh.

586
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:38,920
What do you want?

587
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,881
House wants to biopsy your skin.
He sent me to get it.

588
00:35:42,338 --> 00:35:43,333
Ah, and you agreed.

589
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:47,343
I had nothing to do with putting you in
a coma, or any of the subsequent tests.

590
00:35:47,347 --> 00:35:48,542
Which brings us to now.

591
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,641
I read some of your articles.

592
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:52,691
There were a lot of them.

593
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,611
1967 Massachusetts medical journal.

594
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,721
You radiated babies, just like that.
No forms, no questions, nothing.

595
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:05,310
Who knows how many cancers you caused?

596
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:07,040
I don't know.

597
00:36:07,925 --> 00:36:10,321
What I do know is we
discovered techniques that

598
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:14,511
prevent fatal kidney failures
in hundreds of thousands of other kids.

599
00:36:15,486 --> 00:36:17,982
- You're not sorry.
- I don't regret what I did.

600
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:19,982
Informed consent,

601
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:21,261
patient rights

602
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:23,072
holds back research.

603
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:30,422
What the hell are you doing?

604
00:36:30,575 --> 00:36:32,972
Informed consent is
holding back our diagnosis.

605
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:35,451
Good for you.

606
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:39,250
Finally standing up for something.

607
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:42,080
Acting on what you believe.

608
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:48,993
Dr. House?

609
00:36:49,797 --> 00:36:50,741
How are you?

610
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:54,592
- Not as good as you think I am.
- Don't worry, I'm not stalking you.

611
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:57,560
My dad just lost his medicine. He had
to come back for another prescription.

612
00:36:57,566 --> 00:36:58,511
Yeah, right.

613
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:00,863
He's moving it on the street, isn't he?

614
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:02,673
Yeah, my dad, the meth kingpin.

615
00:37:06,047 --> 00:37:08,142
Why haven't you returned
any of my calls?

616
00:37:10,298 --> 00:37:11,241
I plan to.

617
00:37:11,985 --> 00:37:13,080
In a couple of years.

618
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,343
I was just calling to say thank you,

619
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:19,870
and to tell you how impressed I was. You
diagnosed my dad by just looking at him.

620
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,103
Felt his glands too.

621
00:37:24,078 --> 00:37:25,670
Oh, there's my dad. I gotta go.

622
00:37:27,387 --> 00:37:28,870
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, and

623
00:37:29,695 --> 00:37:32,563
you really don't have to wait
a couple years to return my calls.

624
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:33,512
Just six months.

625
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:34,931
Till I turn 18.

626
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:48,833
It's not Kawasaki's either. What's next?

627
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:51,752
- Congo red.
- Amyloidosis?

628
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:54,240
What the hell else
would I mean by Congo red?

629
00:37:54,245 --> 00:37:55,210
It's not on the list.

630
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:56,942
There's no reason
for it to be on the list.

631
00:37:56,945 --> 00:38:00,060
An abnormal protein is building
up inside the cells of his body,

632
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:02,602
shutting down his organs, one by one.
Explains everything,

633
00:38:02,608 --> 00:38:05,303
the infiltrates on the x-ray,
the bone marrow, kidney failure.

634
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:08,642
We rejected amyloidosis because it
didn't fit the first symptom we found.

635
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:10,193
- It would affect his heart.
- It did.

636
00:38:10,197 --> 00:38:13,291
- It wasn't on the stress test.
- We didn't push him hard enough.

637
00:38:13,297 --> 00:38:14,843
Add the stain, let's find out.

638
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:18,323
Congo red added.

639
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:21,982
Change the polarization
of the light already.

640
00:38:30,168 --> 00:38:32,002
That means it should be treatable.

641
00:38:32,715 --> 00:38:35,161
- How the hell did you pull that out of
- Not out of mine.

642
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,360
I had a muse.

643
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,250
Oh, god.

644
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:43,403
Protein type AA.

645
00:39:02,055 --> 00:39:04,090
- Dr. House--
- You have amyloidosis.

646
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:08,331
It's in your lungs,
kidneys, bone marrow, and brain.

647
00:39:11,008 --> 00:39:12,501
Why should I believe you now?

648
00:39:17,748 --> 00:39:18,692
If I was lying,

649
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:21,323
I wouldn't tell you the subtype is AA.

650
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:24,440
It's terminal.

651
00:39:27,396 --> 00:39:28,443
Congratulations.

652
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:32,662
You got your answer.

653
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:53,422
Fresno by night.

654
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,820
Six months and counting.

655
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:08,892
Ezra Powell passed away last night.

656
00:41:09,356 --> 00:41:11,453
But I'm sure you
already knew about that.

657
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:13,463
Nope. I just got in.

658
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:17,953
The nurse charted at 2:00 AM he was
stable. Breathing labored, but regular.

659
00:41:18,257 --> 00:41:20,003
Then at 2:30, he suddenly stopped.

660
00:41:20,305 --> 00:41:21,801
You know anything about that?

661
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:22,790
If I did,

662
00:41:23,385 --> 00:41:24,930
would you really want to know?

663
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:39,800
I'm proud of you.
