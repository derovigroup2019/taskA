1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,595
Ladies and gentlemen,
step around, gather around.

2
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:05,701
Let me show you a way to make a little
easy money. Understand what I'm sayin'?

3
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:08,687
These are the blacks, don't follow them.
Follow the Queen... know why?

4
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:11,561
'Cause she's red, and that
means she is hot! Find the Queen.

5
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:13,805
The first of the day is free to play.
Who wants to play?

6
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,894
You look interested, my man.
You want to step on up?

7
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,200
Come on, now, who wants to play?
What about you, sweetie?

8
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:21,001
You're cute, come on up.
Cute girls win money all day.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,140
You look lucky, now.

10
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:25,083
Follow the Queen, here we go.
Follow the Queen, follow the Queen.

11
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:27,477
She ain't no Helen Mirren,
but this Queen is for you.

12
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:29,448
Which one is it?
Which one is it?

13
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:31,829
- It's right there.
- Right there?

14
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,637
Beginner's luck.
I'll tell you what, takes a woman

15
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:38,790
to know a woman, takes a lady
to find a Queen.

16
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,784
There you go...

17
00:00:41,222 --> 00:00:42,174
Want to double up?

18
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:46,105
We gonna chance it, we gonna chance it.

19
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:48,921
All right, here we go.
All you gotta do is find your Queen.

20
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:51,351
You will not win again.
You will not win again.

21
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:53,333
All right, here we go...
find your Queen.

22
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:55,083
Find your Queen.
Where is she?

23
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:57,124
Boom...
can you find her?

24
00:00:57,353 --> 00:00:59,095
- Right there.
- This one?

25
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,696
Oh, my gosh, she is killin' me.

26
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,236
She is taking all my rent.

27
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:05,499
Anybody else want to get behind
the good-luck girl?

28
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:06,509
I can do it.

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,082
You can do it?
You're next.

30
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,717
Give me a chance to get my money back

31
00:01:09,718 --> 00:01:11,641
or I'm gonna be out
here sleeping on the street.

32
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:14,244
Ready? This is the last time.
I'm not messin' no more.

33
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:16,807
You're taking all my money, girl.
Here we go.

34
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:19,991
This is your last chance.
Follow the Queen, follow the Queen.

35
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:21,633
Where's she at?
I'll show you one time.

36
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,420
There she is, boom, boom, boom.

37
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:24,814
Pick a card.

38
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,233
Uh, I can't decide.

39
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,829
What do you mean?
Just pick a card, just make a decision.

40
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,801
I can't decide.

41
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,390
Any card will do.
Left, right, center?

42
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:36,030
I don't... I don't know.

43
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:37,973
- Do you want the right?!
- I don't know.

44
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:40,139
The left?
The center?

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,090
I don't know. I...

46
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:42,999
Move out the way,
let somebody else play then.

47
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:45,505
I can't decide.
I... I can't.

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,533
- You want to flip a coin for it?
- What's wrong with me?

50
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,115
Scariest 30 seconds of my life.

51
00:02:30,913 --> 00:02:32,113
I couldn't do anything.

52
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:34,504
It's like I couldn't
move inside my head.

53
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:38,876
It's called abulia, the inability
to make a decision or exercise will.

54
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:40,804
Is it gonna happen again?

55
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,134
It's part of a T. I.A....

56
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:43,619
a Transient Ischemic Attack.

57
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,925
Blood was cut off to a
section of your frontal lobe.

58
00:02:45,926 --> 00:02:47,363
Is that like a stroke or something?

59
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:48,314
A little.

60
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:51,289
What drugs have you taken recently?

61
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:53,154
No drugs.

62
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,246
Toxins are another possibility.

63
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:57,878
You might have been exposed
to something at work, for instance.

64
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,438
No real job right now.

65
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:03,355
Exposure can build up over
time and lie dormant for a while.

66
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:04,910
What was your last job?

67
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:05,834
Pet store.

68
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:06,785
Exotic pets?

69
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:08,127
Tropical fish.

70
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:09,495
And before that?

71
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:10,614
Unemployment.

72
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,665
And before that I sold
subscriptions on the phone.

73
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,250
And before that, unemployment.

74
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:23,387
Before that I worked at Jeans Gone Wild.

75
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:25,518
Before that, unemployment.

76
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:28,613
Before that, I walked dogs.

77
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,500
And before that...

78
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:34,827
Loss of free will.

79
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:36,583
I like it.

80
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:39,581
Maybe we can get Thomas
Aquinas in for a consult.

81
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:41,765
What caused the T.I.A.?

82
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:44,032
Arteries are clear.
No sign of a clot.

83
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,153
Could've dissolved.
Most likely came from her heart.

84
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:47,334
We should do a bubble study.

85
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:49,833
Clots are unlikely in a
29-year-old who's not on the pill.

86
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,866
It's probably a vaso-spasm
caused by drugs.

87
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:52,817
I don't think so.

88
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,492
She goes from job to job.

89
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:56,504
Maybe there's come kind of A. D. here.

90
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,594
Help us pinpoint where
the neurological...

91
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:00,990
She goes from job to job
because she's a scam artist.

92
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,325
She works just long enough
to qualify for unemployment,

93
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,212
then gets fired and gets high.

94
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,979
I still don't think it's drugs.

95
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:08,620
Did you check for infection?

96
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:11,104
LP showed nothing.
No fever, white blood count is normal.

97
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:12,355
Could be toxic exposure.

98
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:14,467
You're the one always
saying it must be drugs.

99
00:04:14,468 --> 00:04:16,598
You figure he's a minority,
she must be stoned?

100
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,032
- You know that's not what I...
- She seems like a nice girl.

101
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,057
You haven't met her!

102
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:23,562
She was pregnant at 15, dropped out of
high school. She's a real overachiever.

103
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,747
Come on, cut her some slack...
her baby died of SIDS.

104
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:28,936
This isn't some romantic story
about a nice girl scarred by tragedy.

105
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:31,305
She's a drug-using scam
artist scarred by tragedy.

106
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:33,933
On the other hand,
her tox-screen just came back.

107
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,014
She's clean.

108
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,368
You're wasting my time.

109
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:37,319
He's waste...

110
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,425
Second ex-Mrs. Wilson want money?

111
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:47,266
I am no longer paying alimony.

112
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:50,327
She wanted her independence,
so she got her Realtor's license.

113
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:52,236
Market's doing badly, she wants money.

114
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:54,937
The market's doing badly,
she's moving into a condo.

115
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:55,743
She wants...

116
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:57,194
She wants me to take Hector.

117
00:04:58,793 --> 00:04:59,743
Pool boy?

118
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:01,513
Dog.

119
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,019
No longer interested.

120
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,470
We got him on our honeymoon.

121
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,240
So I'm, like, the other parent.

122
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:08,439
But I can't take him.

123
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,242
My hotel doesn't allow dogs.

124
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:11,741
Besides, I'm always here.

125
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,595
I asked Cuddy to a play Thursday.

126
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,502
Oh, you... okay.

127
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,817
She said she was busy.

128
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:23,084
And you didn't believe her, so

129
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:26,116
you bribed a janitor,
broke into her computer,

130
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,025
checked her appointments...
- I asked her as a test.

131
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,279
What would you have
learned if she'd said yes?

132
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,330
A lot about bondage.

133
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:34,881
She's busy for me, but not for you.

134
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:38,232
She's not interested in the playquaplay,
she's interested in you.

135
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:42,225
No, I'm not getting sucked
into the vortex of your insanity again.

136
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:45,277
Don't pass me notes in class,
don't tell me to ask her to the prom.

137
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,783
You cannot see her socially.

138
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:47,957
You're leading her on.

139
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,058
I'll consider that,
after I take her to the Hockney exhibit.

140
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:53,275
On Thursday.

141
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:54,863
See, she is busy.

142
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,810
It's not a date.

143
00:05:57,985 --> 00:05:59,085
She enjoyed the play.

144
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:00,773
I enjoyed her enjoying the play.

145
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:01,914
The woman works hard.

146
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:03,315
It's nice to see her relax.

147
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:08,023
So all this enjoying
is an act of charity?

148
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,327
I'm keeping the receipts
for tax purposes.

149
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,356
What's life without the
ability to make stupid choices?

150
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:20,858
She needs her free will.

151
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:24,339
Find out why her brain froze before she
can't decide to take her next breath.

152
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,479
You find the toxins,
you run the bubble study.

153
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,336
You won't find anything,
but I'll get the office to myself.

154
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:31,686
There's a lot of porn
piling up on the internet.

155
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:32,937
Doesn't download itself.

156
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:37,849
Eric... Eric!

157
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,790
Hello, Mr. Foreman.

158
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:42,517
Dr. Chase, how are you?

159
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:43,412
Good.

160
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:44,663
You're lucky you caught us...

161
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:45,814
I'll meet you outside.

162
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,140
Hey, Dad.

163
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:51,105
Uh, I've gotta go.

164
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,561
Why are you here?

165
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:53,702
Everything okay?

166
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:55,603
Good as ever.

167
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:58,362
We're staying at
a hotel down the street.

168
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:00,121
You didn't bring Mom with you?

169
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:02,609
It's gonna be her 60th
birthday in a few days.

170
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:04,764
I know...
we talked about it on the phone.

171
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:06,415
You said you couldn't come home.

172
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:08,484
You didn't have to come.

173
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:11,229
You haven't been home in eight years.

174
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,561
She should see you...

175
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,822
while she still knows who you are.

176
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:23,320
Dad, I've talked to her on the phone.

177
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:27,689
She only knows who I am... sometimes.

178
00:07:28,705 --> 00:07:29,655
Sometimes...

179
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:32,599
is important.

180
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:37,034
So what's up with your dad?

181
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:38,738
Didn't know he was gonna be in town?

182
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:39,689
No.

183
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:44,933
A building this old,
there could be toxic exposure anywhere.

184
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:48,181
Asbestos, mold, the coloring
agents in the old wallpaper.

185
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:50,598
Or it could be drugs.

186
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:52,332
I thought we ruled out...

187
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,886
Clean tox-screen means
drugs didn't cause the T.I.A.

188
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:58,819
Drugs can be laced
with toxic substances.

189
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,079
Arsenic, rat poison.

190
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,134
The drugs wash out of her system,
the toxins stick around.

191
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:05,203
Exposure could come
about any number of ways.

192
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:07,416
There's no reason to assume
it was through drug use.

193
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,367
Absolutely, except for the crack pipe.

194
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:12,232
I'll test her blood
for arsenic and rat poison.

195
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,489
Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

196
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:17,681
Your dad asked you out for dinner?

197
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,615
I'll do the tests.

198
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:22,534
You're stuck with your family.

199
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:27,348
You like Hockney?

200
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,275
You heard about that.

201
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,828
The pop stuff or
the Venezuelan pictures?

202
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,183
That's a trick question.

203
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:38,749
Yes, but you have
no idea how it's a trick.

204
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:40,497
I like art.

205
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:41,698
I'm open to new things.

206
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:42,702
What's the problem?

207
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,104
You're going to a gallery to see
Venezuelan pictures that don't exist,

208
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:47,453
but you won't go to a play with me.

209
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:48,104
Why?

210
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:50,911
House, why is my social
life suddenly red hot?

211
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:54,174
One minute I'm mushing
along with the huskies, as usual,

212
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:55,885
and suddenly it's global warming.

213
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:58,685
You think you saw somebody
else pick up a toy from the sandbox,

214
00:08:58,686 --> 00:08:59,986
and suddenly you want it.

215
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,466
Is that why you said no?

216
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:06,260
Maybe I just want a friend,
and I thought Wilson was a safe choice.

217
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:08,304
I'm not safe?

218
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,062
Cool.

219
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:14,554
James Wilson is never the safe choice.

220
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:17,032
We're going to a gallery,
we're not getting married.

221
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,233
Sure, you say that now.

222
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:20,562
He always marries 'em in the end.

223
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,330
Is that Eric?

224
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:35,826
Eric!

225
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:37,096
Oho ho ho.

226
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:40,310
Oh, baby, baby.

227
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:45,232
I wanted to find that picture
I took at your high school graduation.

228
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:46,233
I had it re-framed.

229
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:49,219
It's in one of these suitcases,
but I don't know...

230
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:50,924
You could show it to me later.

231
00:09:57,942 --> 00:10:00,143
Your father wants to
know if you've been praying.

232
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:02,996
You don't have to just
come out with it like that.

233
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,203
But I only want to know if you're happy.

234
00:10:05,528 --> 00:10:06,859
Sure, I'm okay.

235
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,631
You like it here, you have friends?

236
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:10,553
Yeah, everything's great, Mom.

237
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,809
That's why I brought
the picture for you.

238
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,460
I remember when you were little,

239
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,735
you liked to look in the back
of the math book because you knew

240
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:19,621
even though it made no sense then,

241
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,587
by the end of the year,
you'd understand it all.

242
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,112
That's why you brought the picture?

243
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:28,624
You wanted to look ahead
to see how far you'd go.

244
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,330
Now you're a grown man,
I thought you might like to look back

245
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,457
to see how far you've come.

246
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,643
It all makes sense now, doesn't it?

247
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:45,235
That isn't mine.

248
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,711
It was in your closet.

249
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:50,304
It belongs to this guy
who used to live with me.

250
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:53,788
You might want to let him
know he's got arsenic poisoning.

251
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:57,491
We should get a sample of
his hair so we can see the extent...

252
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:58,442
But I don't do...

253
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,070
I don't do drugs.

254
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:12,438
Get a crash cart in here!

255
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,439
Respiratory arrest!

256
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,338
Are you sure it isn't from the arsenic?

257
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,671
Dr. Foreman said I was poisoned.

258
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,279
Your hair showed only a trace amount.

259
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,173
Not enough to damage
your lungs like this.

260
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:27,724
We need you to stay still now.

261
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,314
Six-millimeter cuts
starting at the apices.

262
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,883
Also, I just wanted to let you know,
should you change your mind,

263
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:37,894
I'll be available.

264
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,908
Aren't you getting
tired of hearing me say it?

265
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:45,387
I have no intention of going
out with you, of having sex with you...

266
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:47,397
of doing anything with you except work.

267
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:49,752
We don't have to make
a big deal about it.

268
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:51,403
I just thought I'd let you know.

269
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,836
I've decided Tuesdays
would be a good day to do that.

270
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:57,802
You did not suddenly
fall in love with me.

271
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,940
You were looking for something,
and I happened to be...

272
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:02,455
It's fine.

273
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:05,118
No need to go on about it.

274
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:09,585
I'm dancing through the lung bases.

275
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:13,055
- We need to put this behind this.
- Understood.

276
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,289
But you keep bringing it up.

277
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,090
You're the one who's still talking.

278
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,875
Look, I'm not demanding
anything from you.

279
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:20,375
I'm not following you home.

280
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,820
I've got no expectations.

281
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:25,589
A gentle, polite reminder
once a week is hardly stalking.

282
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:32,236
There's a mass...

283
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:34,108
just outside the lingular.

284
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,816
Biopsy shows there are white blood
cells in the walls of the blood vessels.

285
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:43,091
They're not supposed
to get past the bouncers.

286
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:45,112
It's gotta be autoimmune...
something lymphocytic.

287
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:47,041
The white blood cells
are attacking her own body.

288
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:48,984
Only question is
what kind of autoimmune?

289
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:50,142
It doesn't matter what kind.

290
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:51,593
It always matters what kind.

291
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,116
Treatment's always steroids.

292
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:54,517
Treatment is always boring.

293
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:55,501
Diagnosis...

294
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:57,604
Okay, it's affecting
the larger blood vessels.

295
00:12:57,605 --> 00:12:59,106
It's gotta be Giant Cell arteritis.

296
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:00,427
I'll start her on steroids.

297
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:02,230
It's affecting the
smaller blood vessels.

298
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:03,567
Gotta be lupus vasculitis.

299
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:04,920
I'll start her on steroids.

300
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:05,713
It's affecting...

301
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:06,686
Yeah, got it.

302
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:08,797
Start her on steroids.

303
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:09,957
Good idea.

304
00:13:12,163 --> 00:13:13,401
Told you it was boring.

305
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:15,631
I gotta go out.

306
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:16,651
Why?

307
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:17,793
Wilson's got a date.

308
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:22,515
It's got 15-foot ceilings,
it's an open floor plan.

309
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:26,475
You know, I can't believe you called me.

310
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:27,913
Hey, I need a condo.

311
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:32,389
Didn't you and Wilson have
your first date around here?

312
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:36,304
Wow, you rember where
our first date was?

313
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:38,685
I didn't think you
were paying attention.

314
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:39,636
Really?

315
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:40,923
He's my best friend.

316
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:43,133
Our first date was in Boston.

317
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,305
Oh.

318
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:46,965
Not quite as close
to here as I rembered.

319
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,639
But we're not here to talk about him.

320
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,590
Absolutely not.

321
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,135
Wait'll you see the kitchen.

322
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:55,269
All-granite countertops.

323
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,049
Since I wasn't paying attention
back then, what was it like dating him?

324
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:03,137
So this is Hockney?

325
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:04,325
No.

326
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:06,171
I don't know what happened.

327
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:08,207
I'm sure you don't.

328
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:13,368
I never knew your
tastes were so eclectic.

329
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:16,877
Oh, the Hockney exhibit
finished on April 20th.

330
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,270
I thought it was May 20th.

331
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:19,784
Okay, my bad.

332
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,560
This is not somewhere
I'd bring someone on a date.

333
00:14:25,352 --> 00:14:27,585
N- not that this is a date, obviously.

334
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:31,428
I was just thinking...

335
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:34,929
he's doing landscapes
on multiple canvases now, and

336
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:39,028
they're kinda peaceful.
And you're always so busy.

337
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,590
I don't think I've ever
seen you embarrassed before.

338
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,485
Oh, it was never adate.

339
00:14:46,874 --> 00:14:51,317
I was coming off a bad relationship,
and he said we could go out as friends.

340
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:54,179
You know,
just go see plays, go to a museum.

341
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,637
I didn't think you liked Trenton.

342
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:57,588
Love it.

343
00:14:57,777 --> 00:15:01,414
So he'd say it's not a date,
but then he'd jump you.

344
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:02,472
Oh, no, he meant it.

345
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,829
James Wilson, carefully calibrating
his level of protectiveness for your

346
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,750
individual needs.

347
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,026
Did you just compare Wilson to a tampon?

348
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,366
No.

349
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:15,357
It was very endearing.

350
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,379
He really just wanted to be a friend.

351
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:19,056
So I jumped him.

352
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,699
The bedroom's through here.

353
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:25,419
That's such a bad idea.

354
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:29,645
There is no way that won't
cause damage to the large intestine.

355
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,951
Are you keeping us here to torture me?

356
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:37,834
Is that a bicycle pump?

357
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:38,995
That's what I'm saying.

358
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:40,896
It's like walking into a sticky trap.

359
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,650
Once you're the focus of
all that attention, it's addictive.

360
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:47,137
This unit's kitchen
has got a chef's oven.

361
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:48,778
I cook a lot.

362
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:49,822
Go on.

363
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,423
It's the emotional stuff
that really sucks you in.

364
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:56,171
He's just so "knight
in shining armor," you know?

365
00:15:56,897 --> 00:16:00,500
Always there to support you,
until one day he's not.

366
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,159
But by then, you're hooked.

367
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:07,896
Hey, do you think that you
could talk to him about taking the dog?

368
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:11,444
He's the only one that
Hector really gets along with.

369
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,419
Hey, we're here to talk real estate,
not Wilson.

370
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:21,663
So you're saying if you'd actually had
sex before you connected emotionally,

371
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:25,007
you'd have gotten over him.
- Oh, yeah. It seems weird, right?

372
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:29,551
'Cause sex with James was fantastic.

373
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:33,454
Nobody works harder to
give a woman what she wants.

374
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,239
It's got six burners.

375
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:39,245
The chef's oven.

376
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:40,513
Right.

377
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,191
How you feeling?

378
00:16:50,598 --> 00:16:51,948
That wasn't my crack pipe.

379
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:53,011
You told me.

380
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:53,962
Are you tired?

381
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:56,439
I just took a hit off it a couple times.

382
00:16:57,614 --> 00:16:59,564
What's wrong with having a little fun?

383
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,765
Your personal life
is none of my business.

384
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,113
You don't like me, though, do you?

385
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:07,364
That's your imagination.

386
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,343
I've seen every kind of drug abuse.

387
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:12,094
No offense, but you don't
even stand out in the pack.

388
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:15,336
I'm betting you got money
the same place you got attitude.

389
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:19,648
You know, people who quit drinking,
and people who lose weight,

390
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:22,226
they think they're better
than the people that couldn't.

391
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:24,245
And because you got out of the projects,

392
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:29,719
you think that anybody
who didn't is weak and stupid.

393
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:30,886
I'm not judging you.

394
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,084
Take a breath.

395
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,270
The only difference between me and
you is that I made some bad decisions,

396
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:38,099
and you made some good ones.

397
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,682
You make bad decisions
every day of your life.

398
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:42,806
Stop doing drugs, stop having fun.

399
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:44,681
Go back to school and get your GED.

400
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:46,532
Yeah, where's the money coming from?

401
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:49,007
The system's not set
up for people like me.

402
00:17:50,354 --> 00:17:51,604
What are you staring at?

403
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:53,219
Your eyes.

404
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:57,957
There's yellow in the sclera.

405
00:17:58,852 --> 00:17:59,902
Her liver's failing.

406
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:03,162
Without a transplant,
she'll be dead in the next 48 hours.

407
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:04,908
We should increase
her immunosuppressants,

408
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:07,168
and target more specifically,
add methotrexate.

409
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,463
Let's do more of what's not working.
This is not an autoimmune disease.

410
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,459
Her white blood cells are attacking
her body. That's autoimmune.

411
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,260
First brain, then lungs, now liver.

412
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:17,324
All getting worse and all in two days.

413
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:18,573
It's moving too fast.

414
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:20,661
It's gotta be cancer.

415
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:22,503
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis.

416
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:26,014
It's rare even by our standards,
but it fits her symptoms.

417
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:27,693
Explains why the
steroids aren't working.

418
00:18:27,694 --> 00:18:30,297
- Poor fingernail growth.
- A lot of people have bad fingernails.

419
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:32,763
A lot of people don't have
three organ systems shutting down.

420
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:34,946
Her blood vessels are
taking this thing everywhere.

421
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,547
She needs total body radiation.

422
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:38,362
We can't do anything
until we can confirm...

423
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:41,617
Running those immuno-chemistries could
take a week. She'll be dead by the time.

424
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:43,141
That doesn't make radiation any safer.

425
00:18:43,142 --> 00:18:45,800
Okay, suppose Chase
and Cameron are right.

426
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:48,348
Suppose it's an autoimmune disease.

427
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,360
What's the biggest danger
of total body radiation?

428
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:52,987
It suppresses the immune system,

429
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:55,988
which is what we're trying
to do with the steroids anyway.

430
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:59,715
I don't usually put out on
my first date, but I've gotta say

431
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:01,182
that is a rad move.

432
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:02,743
Get her consent.

433
00:19:02,963 --> 00:19:04,013
Start the radiation.

434
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:08,696
The patient is not too thrilled with me.

435
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:09,797
I'll get her consent.

436
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:14,697
Foreman's got a personality issue,
soyou'regonna step in?

437
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:16,762
A patient doesn't like Foreman.

438
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:18,123
I'm interested.

439
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:27,022
Fatigue, hair loss, possibility
of damage to the lungs, infertility.

440
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,755
All possible side effects of radiation.

441
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,090
Why don't you like Dr. Foreman?

442
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,248
He thinks he's better than he is.

443
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:39,793
How good is he?

444
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:41,089
I don't know.

445
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,197
Can we get back to what's wrong with me?

446
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:46,462
There's a small possibility
of leukemia sometime in the future.

447
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,230
Hardly worth mentioning.

448
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,162
You can't say that he
thinks he's better than he is

449
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:52,863
if you don't know how good he is.

450
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:55,969
No one's as good as he thinks he is.

451
00:19:56,174 --> 00:19:57,124
I am.

452
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:58,986
You might also get cataracts.

453
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:00,618
Sign here.

454
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:03,039
I don't know.

455
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:06,062
You're telling me how dangerous this is.

456
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:07,263
We're saving your life.

457
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:08,889
We're that good.

458
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:10,739
Sign there.

459
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:14,007
I can't decide.

460
00:20:16,643 --> 00:20:19,295
Would you rather a pencil or a pen?

461
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,957
Who's the better James Bond,
Sean Connery or Daniel Craig?

462
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,728
Now, see, that's not even a decision.

463
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,829
It's happening again.

464
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,170
I can't...

465
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:34,993
I can't...

466
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:36,094
I... can't...

467
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,491
Up her blood thinners
and get her down to radiology.

468
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:04,547
The attack will be over in 20 minutes.

469
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:06,326
Then she'll want to sign this.

470
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:19,156
Bonnie called last night
to talk about the dog.

471
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,374
Your name came up.

472
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:25,082
Good Lord, how do you still have teeth?

473
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,580
She's the worst Realtor in New Jersey.

474
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:29,961
What is this, escalation?

475
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:32,595
I go out with Cuddy,
you hook up with my ex?

476
00:21:32,882 --> 00:21:35,029
I don't even know what
that's designed to do.

477
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,980
You're an addict.

478
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:38,453
I'm saving you from yourself.

479
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,713
By condo shopping?
Thank you.

480
00:21:41,314 --> 00:21:43,374
If I can figure out
where you keep going wrong,

481
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,248
then I can nip this
Cuddy thing in the bud

482
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:47,599
before she becomes
the fourth ex-Mrs. Wilson.

483
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:51,070
Yes, I was worried there
was no way to stop that train.

484
00:21:51,212 --> 00:21:52,862
You have to have sex with Cuddy.

485
00:21:55,193 --> 00:21:57,333
Wait... to stop the train?

486
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:02,916
Bonnie said I'm bad in bed?

487
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:04,379
Huh?

488
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:09,657
Yeah, she also said that if she'd
slept with you before she liked you,

489
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:12,639
then it would have made it easier
to handle when you turned into the sorry

490
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,040
bastard who left her alone.

491
00:22:18,953 --> 00:22:21,422
I told her you were wasting her time,
by the way.

492
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,073
You think that's gonna stop her?

493
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,430
The woman's the worst
Realtor in New Jersey.

494
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:28,861
How do you feel?

495
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:30,027
Weak.

496
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:30,978
Sleeping a lot.

497
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:32,593
That's normal after radiation.

498
00:22:32,994 --> 00:22:33,944
Deep breath.

499
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:37,074
A little queasy too.

500
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:41,376
When I feel sick to my stomach,
I always want vanilla ice cream.

501
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:42,824
It's soothing.

502
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:44,724
It's best to stick with liquids for now.

503
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:45,675
Shh.

504
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,230
I'm getting a murmur.

505
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:51,872
Oh, my arm.

506
00:22:52,131 --> 00:22:53,081
It's hurting me!

507
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:53,977
Take it off!

508
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:54,928
Take it off!

509
00:22:58,637 --> 00:22:59,751
Oh, my God, oh, my...

510
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:08,088
Pain is the issue.

511
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:12,665
Just the pressure of the BP
cuff was enough to start her screaming.

512
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:13,616
That's not cancer.

513
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:15,455
It sounds like...

514
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:19,482
Sounds like she's septic.

515
00:23:23,357 --> 00:23:24,957
A lot of things can cause pain.

516
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:26,696
How much pain?

517
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,741
Too much.

518
00:23:32,716 --> 00:23:33,666
It's not cancer.

519
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,329
It's not autoimmune.

520
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:39,113
It's an infection and
we fried her immune system.

521
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:41,561
But she had no fever, LP was clear.

522
00:23:43,348 --> 00:23:45,652
Do an echo to confirm it's in the heart.

523
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:52,188
And then I'll tell our
patient that we just killed her.

524
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:55,369
I'll tell her.

525
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,967
You haven't been
returning my phone calls.

526
00:24:09,787 --> 00:24:11,263
- I'm busy.
- Well...

527
00:24:11,337 --> 00:24:14,543
But if you have half an hour
a little later this afternoon,

528
00:24:14,544 --> 00:24:17,021
I just found this unit
ten minutes from here.

529
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:20,805
- It hasn't been on the market yet.
- I'm off the market for condos.

530
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,128
James was right?

531
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:27,117
I never had the teeniest
chance of selling you anything.

532
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:28,318
Of course he was right.

533
00:24:29,012 --> 00:24:32,330
Wilson doesn't stop giving good
advice just 'cause you're divorced.

534
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:35,331
He's compulsive about remaing
on good terms with his exes.

535
00:24:42,212 --> 00:24:44,712
Do you want to know
why I named that dog Hector?

536
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,105
No, let's keep it a mystery.

537
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:50,338
Because even when he was a puppy, he was
the worst-tempered dog we'd ever seen.

538
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,249
He was supposed to be house trained.

539
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,308
He'd pee on the carpet every morning.

540
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,725
When we had people over,
he had to nip at their ankles.

541
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:02,145
"Hector does go rug" is
an anagram for Dr. Greg House.

542
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:04,467
That's how early in
the marriage I resented you.

543
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:05,369
Wow.

544
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,250
Did I ever waste money
on that place setting.

545
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:10,520
James at least had the decency
to feel guilty when he hurt me.

546
00:25:10,613 --> 00:25:11,963
Whereas I didn't hurt you.

547
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,559
I didn't even marry you, cleverly
hoping to avoid moments like this one.

548
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,410
You always needed him,
and he was always there for you!

549
00:25:18,546 --> 00:25:20,591
If you keep yelling,
I think you'll owe me sex.

550
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:23,500
You knew he had a wife waiting
at home... you didn't care.

551
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:26,701
I'm not saying you broke up
the marriage, but you didn't help.

552
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:34,918
First, "Hector does
go rug" is a lame anagram.

553
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,764
You want a better one for Gregory House?

554
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:38,253
"Huge ego, sorry."

555
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:39,873
Second, find a new career.

556
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:43,194
You're never gonna sell anybody
if you let them control the agenda.

557
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:45,384
Third, I don't owe you anything...
I'm not Wilson.

558
00:25:45,385 --> 00:25:48,235
I'm not gonna buy a condo
just to make you feel better.

559
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:58,274
You okay?

560
00:25:58,629 --> 00:25:59,579
Yeah.

561
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,671
Tell me how to do this.

562
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:04,368
House says people thank you after...

563
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:05,319
It's not typical.

564
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:09,453
I already killed this woman.

565
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:13,237
All I can do now is
not make any more mistakes.

566
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:21,337
First of all,
stop thinking you can minimize the hurt.

567
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:24,324
A lot of people are
afraid of the word "dying."

568
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:27,199
If you pussyfoot around it,
she is not gonna read your mind.

569
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,839
Okay.

570
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,790
No, it's not.

571
00:26:29,257 --> 00:26:33,110
When you look in her face, you're
gonna feel the instinct to temporize.

572
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:34,534
Crush it.

573
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:35,809
Yeah.

574
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,545
Then wait.

575
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:39,898
Give her time to process the news.

576
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:43,913
Let her know you'll be
with her through all of it.

577
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:48,423
Wait till she's done thinking,
till she meets your eyes again.

578
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:51,719
Then, if you feel it's appropriate,
you can touch her.

579
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:53,976
Maybe put your hand
on her arm like this.

580
00:26:55,521 --> 00:26:58,521
Let her know she's still
connected to another human being.

581
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,758
You've got this down to a science.

582
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:03,535
You're freaking out.

583
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:04,442
I told you...

584
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:05,693
Give her what she needs.

585
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:08,815
What she doesn't need is
a doctor who's not there with her

586
00:27:08,816 --> 00:27:10,397
because he made the wrong call.

587
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,950
You are freaking out.

588
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:13,387
You should be freaking out.

589
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:16,379
I won't let her see it.

590
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,170
Let her see it.

591
00:27:28,192 --> 00:27:29,142
Hey.

592
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:30,988
How come no mask?

593
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:34,994
We think...

594
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,810
you have an infection.

595
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,007
Didn't the radiation work?

596
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,091
It didn't do what it was supposed to do.

597
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:48,975
You're dying.

598
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:51,259
What...

599
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:54,831
you mean, like,
things are bad, and someday I'm gonna...

600
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:57,335
How much time?

601
00:27:59,764 --> 00:28:00,719
How much time?

602
00:28:01,406 --> 00:28:02,556
We can't know exactly.

603
00:28:02,705 --> 00:28:03,655
A year?

604
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,666
Less than a year?

605
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:08,502
Less than 24 hours.

606
00:28:10,226 --> 00:28:11,226
I don't understand.

607
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:13,075
Why are you saying this to me?

608
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:14,276
You trying to scare me?

609
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,593
Why would you do that?

610
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:17,673
I'm sorry, it's true.

611
00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:20,266
How bad is this cancer?

612
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:22,408
Yesterday you thought I had a chance.

613
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:24,308
You don't have cancer.

614
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:28,077
You came in with an infection.

615
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:30,380
We didn't catch it.

616
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:31,581
What kind of infection?

617
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:33,057
Doesn't matter.

618
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:37,413
The radiation was the
worst thing we could've done.

619
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:41,768
We destroyed the part of
your body that was fighting it off.

620
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:43,405
It spread to your heart.

621
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:44,736
Then give me drugs.

622
00:28:45,316 --> 00:28:46,916
They have drugs for infections.

623
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:49,124
Antibiotics work with the immune system.

624
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:52,485
But your immune system is
nonexistent because of the radiation.

625
00:28:52,486 --> 00:28:55,279
If it's my heart,
you can get me a new heart.

626
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:58,201
People have heart
transplants all the time.

627
00:28:58,428 --> 00:28:59,378
It wouldn't help.

628
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:03,041
The infection is everywhere.

629
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,818
There's nothing anybody can do.

630
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:21,833
I'm so sorry.

631
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:29,721
We've called your grandparents.

632
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:33,628
Get the hell away from me!

633
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:35,302
Get out!

634
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,432
Get out!

635
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:16,811
I think it's broken.

636
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:20,409
Nothing like a melodramatic
gesture to solve everything.

637
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,338
We were wrong too.

638
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:22,818
Steroids wouldn't have helped her.

639
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:23,969
I didn't not help her.

640
00:30:23,984 --> 00:30:25,534
I actually pulled the trigger.

641
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,798
There's nothing left for you to do.

642
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:31,059
- One of us could go home with...
- You're trying to make me feel better.

643
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,028
Yeah.

644
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,145
I killed a woman.
Don't you think it's appropriate

645
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:36,609
that I feel like crap
for at least a little while?

646
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,010
It won't help her.

647
00:30:42,553 --> 00:30:43,503
Where is he?

648
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:44,609
He went to the ICU.

649
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:51,832
What are you doing?

650
00:30:52,714 --> 00:30:54,114
Prepping for an aspiration.

651
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,906
We still don't know what infection...

652
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:58,177
- It's not gonna help her.
- It's not gonna hurt her.

653
00:30:58,229 --> 00:31:00,367
- Well, it is, but it's not gonna...
- No.

654
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:04,077
It's just gonna take a few minutes.
Grab a piece of an abscess, some pus.

655
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:05,218
You really don't care.

656
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:07,267
You really don't care
why she's gonna be dead.

657
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:08,441
She's gonna be dead because...

658
00:31:08,442 --> 00:31:09,392
What?!

659
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:13,225
What did we screw up, what did we miss?

660
00:31:16,012 --> 00:31:16,962
I need to know.

661
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:19,695
You'll have to wait.

662
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:30,888
We're moving her back to her room.

663
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,019
Patients who've had total
body radiation have to stay in ICU.

664
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,397
ICU isn't gonna help her.

665
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:37,436
Let's give her some privacy.

666
00:31:49,727 --> 00:31:50,972
What do you want?

667
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,101
Want to see if I'm dying on schedule?

668
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,801
Or do you want me to
tell you it's all right...

669
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:00,892
I'm okay with it?

670
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:03,325
I'd like your forgiveness.

671
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,990
I don't expect it.

672
00:32:06,412 --> 00:32:11,713
Good, 'cause this isn't like you ran
your cart into mine at the supermarket.

673
00:32:12,654 --> 00:32:13,604
No.

674
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,741
Your grandparents haven't arrived yet.

675
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:22,093
If they don't make it on time, is there
anything you would like me to tell them?

676
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,139
I never really knew them.

677
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:28,460
You got any friends you want me to call?

678
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:31,618
It's the middle of the night.

679
00:32:32,658 --> 00:32:36,091
They're not the kind of friends
you ask to help you move, never mind

680
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:37,187
watch you die.

681
00:32:40,801 --> 00:32:41,821
I never did much.

682
00:32:43,358 --> 00:32:44,711
No kid to leave behind.

683
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:50,076
When I go,
the world's not gonna be any different.

684
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,793
Kind of a relief for you, huh?

685
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,331
You were right...

686
00:33:37,284 --> 00:33:38,234
about me.

687
00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:40,029
Yeah, which time?

688
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:42,639
I, uh...

689
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:46,913
I had a problem with you.

690
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:51,961
But you were wrong too.

691
00:33:54,054 --> 00:33:55,554
I've made some bad decisions.

692
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,696
Stole cars, robbed houses.

693
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:01,892
Killed a woman.

694
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:08,617
But then I got another chance.

695
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:13,557
I left home, went to college,
entered a whole other world.

696
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:18,330
But some part of me I can't get rid of
always thinks

697
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:20,949
if I'm not the smartest,

698
00:34:21,496 --> 00:34:25,117
if I'm not the first, everywhere I go,

699
00:34:26,573 --> 00:34:28,936
they'll figure out I'm
not supposed to be here.

700
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:32,119
They'll send me back.

701
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:35,163
You know that's not gonna happen.

702
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,609
You're out.

703
00:34:36,937 --> 00:34:38,318
I'll never be out of there.

704
00:34:41,983 --> 00:34:45,348
When I came home that last
Christmas I was in college, 

705
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:47,491
it was like

706
00:34:48,246 --> 00:34:49,242
the rooms

707
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:51,933
felt so small.

708
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,713
I was suffocating.

709
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:59,187
But when I was standing
on the stoop saying good-bye,

710
00:35:00,952 --> 00:35:02,489
my mom put her arms around me.

711
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,570
That was...

712
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:11,428
that was the last
time I ever felt at home.

713
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,692
I only put distance...

714
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,850
between you and me because
I know there isn't any.

715
00:35:27,808 --> 00:35:29,331
You were right about me too.

716
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,112
That stuff about the system
being against people like me.

717
00:35:38,026 --> 00:35:38,976
I know it's crap.

718
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:43,576
I mean, it's true, but it's also crap.

719
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:48,750
I just wasn't ready to try again.

720
00:35:50,512 --> 00:35:55,726
But I always thought I was young,
I had time.

721
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:13,262
Aren't you ever gonna leave?

722
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,206
No.

723
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:51,431
Yeah?

724
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:53,255
Time of death 3:35.

725
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:55,701
Do whatever you want.

726
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:27,046
You wanna go get drunk?

727
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:29,038
No, thanks.

728
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:30,889
I've got paperwork.

729
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:36,998
Listen, I don't...

730
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:38,989
I don't know what I believe,

731
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:43,459
but sometimes I need to think there's
something out there paying attention.

732
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:49,206
So when I can't talk to anybody, I talk
to God and pretend somebody's listening.

733
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:53,203
We were all wrong, you know?

734
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,790
Even House was wrong.

735
00:37:58,512 --> 00:37:59,462
I know.

736
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,834
I got your consent.

737
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:51,446
Her bra hook.

738
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:53,923
What?

739
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:56,613
She scratched herself with her bra hook.

740
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,621
That's how the infection got in.

741
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:11,423
Staph aureus.

742
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:15,738
She died from a simple staph infection?

743
00:39:17,678 --> 00:39:19,570
That and some bad decisions.

744
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:28,986
I'll be outside.

745
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:45,185
Go home,

746
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,565
have a few drinks,
go to sleep, get up tomorrow,

747
00:39:49,462 --> 00:39:50,576
and do it all over,

748
00:39:51,257 --> 00:39:52,282
only better.

749
00:39:54,717 --> 00:39:59,979
If you need absolution,
go to a priest or give alms to the poor.

750
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:03,277
Whatever ritual comforts you.

751
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,300
I killed her.

752
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:07,776
Yeah, me too.

753
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:12,438
This wasn't, "Oh, I should
have thought of that idea sooner.

754
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:15,117
"This wasn't messing up a dosage.

755
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:18,456
We see a disease rushing
down on someone like a train,

756
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:20,961
we can't always get them out of the way.

757
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,650
This wasn't that.

758
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:26,811
No.

759
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,182
And you'll do it again.

760
00:40:33,135 --> 00:40:39,423
For a lot of doctors, this
would be a once in a lifetime mistake.

761
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:42,937
But we're not a lot of doctors.

762
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:47,181
We must've saved more patients
than the guy down the street.

763
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,934
A few of the ones that he'd save
by doing what everyone else does,

764
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:52,073
we will lose.

765
00:40:53,446 --> 00:40:54,896
So you're giving me numbers.

766
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,536
'Cause they don't lie.

767
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,724
I can't forgive you, Foreman...

768
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:04,341
because there's nothing to forgive.

769
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:25,221
What did you tell him?

770
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:26,929
That guilt is irrelevant.

771
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:29,474
You want to get something to eat?

772
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:30,919
Can't.

773
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:32,791
Got a dog waiting at home.

774
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:48,383
What's wrong?

775
00:41:52,008 --> 00:41:53,308
I did something bad, Mom.

776
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:57,244
I hurt somebody.

777
00:41:57,847 --> 00:41:59,015
It wasn't your fault.

778
00:42:02,315 --> 00:42:03,265
It was.

779
00:42:03,635 --> 00:42:05,689
Then I forgive you.

780
00:42:06,253 --> 00:42:07,203
I forgive you.

781
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,410
I can see from your face...

782
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,730
you'd never hurt anybody on purpose.

783
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:30,532
Do you know who I am, Mom?

784
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,470
It's Eric.

785
00:42:37,812 --> 00:42:38,802
Of course.

786
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,397
My little boy's name is Eric.
