1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,750
Here you go.

2
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:08,677
That fried crap will kill you.

3
00:00:10,022 --> 00:00:10,972
See?

4
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,379
Time to make the donuts.

5
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,408
Hands in the air! Right now!

6
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:28,262
- Get up! Move out here, let's go!
- Move it!

7
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:31,234
Purses and wallets on the counter!
Right now!

8
00:00:31,358 --> 00:00:33,608
Your watches, your jewelry.
Take it all off!

9
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:40,176
Get the girl, get the girl.

10
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,167
We're moving to the back room. Let's go!

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,383
- Let's go!
- Move it!

12
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:45,741
Go on!

13
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:46,693
Not you.

14
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:49,710
No, no. She's staying right here.

15
00:00:50,273 --> 00:00:52,267
- You're not gonna do this.
- Whoa, kid.

16
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:58,378
No, no. Jeremy, please.
Just do what they say. Please.

17
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:00,099
Okay, okay.

18
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:01,597
Move!

19
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:15,099
Son of a bitch! You thought
I was gonna let you hurt my wife?

20
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:17,838
Hey, mister!

21
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:19,348
Your wife.

22
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:21,540
What did he do to her?

23
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:23,328
Nothing.

24
00:01:29,912 --> 00:01:30,857
Tracy!

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,500
House S03E05
Fools for Love

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,557
20-year-old,
married African American female.

27
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,757
Couldn't breathe.
Anaphylaxis-like throat swelling.

28
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:12,327
Children?

29
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,908
- You think pregnancy would explain
- It explains the marriage.

30
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,556
Who the hell gets married at 20?

31
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,008
I'm guessing people in love.

32
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,055
Show me a 20 year-old who's not in love.

33
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:23,288
You get married at 20, you're gonna be
shocked at who you're living with at 30.

34
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:25,408
It's not allergies,
negative on all the skin tests.

35
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,396
Four days on antihistamines
and steroids--

36
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:28,825
- Who's he talking to?
- What?

37
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,777
It's got an ass.

38
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,806
Technically, that makes it a "who."

39
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:35,287
New nurse in peeds. Wendy something.

40
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,436
Swelling just started to go down--

41
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,418
- Seen her here before?
- Couple times.

42
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,935
I tried following her home,
but she gave me the slip.

43
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,397
Swelling's--

44
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:50,515
Think that's funny,

45
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,578
ask him about the time
he sabotaged my cane.

46
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:56,518
Are you serious?

47
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:58,567
There was a point to it.

48
00:02:58,741 --> 00:02:59,898
Wendy, this is House.

49
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:03,875
Something about not getting too "uppity"
with normal folks who walk good.

50
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:07,526
You're everything I'd heard.

51
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:08,596
Nice to meet you.

52
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:15,245
Why so rude?

53
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,526
You've sprinted through
three bad marriages

54
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,595
into an affair with a dying patient.
Now a naughty nurse?

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,746
How many more failed relationships

56
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,655
are we both gonna have to deal
with before you learn to love yourself?

57
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,047
And I mean that in the literal way.

58
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,437
It's amazing how you can
not only know it's a relationship,

59
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,286
but that it's a bad relationship
based on nothing but...

60
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:35,266
- Nothing.
- I know you.

61
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,826
I'm not with her. Not even trying.

62
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:40,716
You're lying to me.

63
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,267
That's interesting.

64
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:44,227
Well, as long as it's interesting.

65
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:49,608
Swelling is--

66
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:50,897
Why is she hanging out here?

67
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:53,086
Anyone interested in what
happened with the swelling?

68
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:54,806
She's in peeds. It's the next wing over.

69
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:57,047
If you're wondering if
Wilson's dating her, ask Wilson.

70
00:03:57,052 --> 00:04:00,106
Clearly he did. And Wilson denied it.
And House doesn't believe it.

71
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,287
It's gotta hurt. That's why it pays
to have more than one friend, House.

72
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:05,438
If he's not hitting that,
why is she here?

73
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:07,798
Because I'm hitting
that and it's totally hot.

74
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,495
Swelling took four days to resolve.

75
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,688
Patient has unexplained,
intense abdominal pains.

76
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:13,767
So explain them.

77
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:16,655
Wake me when they've done
an exploratory laparotomy.

78
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:18,358
Anybody know her? Know her story?

79
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:19,378
Up and at 'em.

80
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:21,097
They did a laparotomy.

81
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:24,118
Liver, bowel,
gallbladder, appendix-- all clean.

82
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,098
Belly pain plus throat swelling.

83
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,227
She was in some sort of assault, right?

84
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:30,027
Simple neck trauma.

85
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:32,505
No one touched her neck, and
if they did, it'd resolve by now.

86
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:34,525
Didn't need to touch her.
Some guy coughed on her?

87
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:36,337
He's in jail and
he's completely healthy,

88
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,338
except for the broken head
he got from the beating he took.

89
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,766
There's pot

90
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:44,805
on her tox screen. Salmonella from
the pot would explain the stomach pains.

91
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,648
It's a stretch. She'd have a fever.

92
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:49,248
She's on steroids for the swelling,
therefore no fever.

93
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:50,805
And the smoking explains the throat.

94
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:52,757
Sorry, take it back. That's a stretch.

95
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:53,826
Got a better idea?

96
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:56,797
Then stretch away.

97
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,915
Start her on fluoroquinolone
for the salmonella.

98
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:11,645
I was waiting two hours out there.

99
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:15,536
Fascinating. Have you considered
a career as a memoirist?

100
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:17,648
Let's see it.

101
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:21,178
You don't introduce yourself?

102
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,408
Sorry, I thought you were waiting two
hours, didn't know you wanted to chat.

103
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,805
Hi, I'm Greg.
How about that local sports team?

104
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,985
It's not an infection.

105
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:34,958
- How can you tell without--
- You want me to touch you?

106
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,218
It's your private place.

107
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:39,435
You're chewing nicotine gum,
which causes dehydration,

108
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:40,836
which causes wear and tear.

109
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:43,586
Try a lubricant.
Or foreplay if you're cheap.

110
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:46,785
Just take a swab
and get it tested, okay?

111
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,687
Sorry.

112
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:51,237
I already met this month's quota
of useless tests for stubborn idiots.

113
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,755
You're rude.

114
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,107
Wow, you're like a

115
00:05:58,272 --> 00:05:59,518
detective, or something.

116
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:00,977
And you're smart.

117
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,967
And you're funny.

118
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:04,895
But you are bitter,

119
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:06,368
and you're lonely.

120
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:08,238
So you treat

121
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,957
everyone around like they're idiots.

122
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:13,147
And you get away with it,

123
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:15,427
'cause of your cane.

124
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:17,437
Please stop.

125
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,136
It's hard to write through
the haze of bitter tears.

126
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,695
But you're not actually
getting away with it.

127
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,157
Last nurse you made fun of,

128
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:27,318
she probably slipped
some crap into your coffee.

129
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:30,597
Nah, I asked for de-crappinated coffee.

130
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:37,845
Treat people like jerks,

131
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,977
you get treated like a jerk.

132
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,177
Thank you.

133
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,216
Bend over.

134
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:10,438
You kidding me?

135
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:12,577
If you have an infection,
you'd have a fever.

136
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,765
You're chewing nicotine gum which
messes with the weather in your mouth,

137
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:17,417
so I need to vacation elsewhere.

138
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,477
And wait till I put the thermometer in.

139
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,818
You break it, you bought it.

140
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:43,315
Leaving early today.

141
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:50,016
You ever get that thing where
you're sure you forgot something,

142
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:51,916
but you can't figure out what?

143
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:55,095
Guess it can't be that important.

144
00:07:56,578 --> 00:08:00,081
Salmonella is a bacterial infection
that you can get from pot plants.

145
00:08:00,302 --> 00:08:01,349
Causes stomach pain.

146
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,631
And my throat?

147
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:05,637
The thinking is it's an inflammatory
reaction to the smoking.

148
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:08,338
How much'd you need to smoke
for your throat to go nuts like that?

149
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:10,836
- Most cases, a lot.
- We don't smoke a lot.

150
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:12,986
Let's just start the treatment.

151
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:14,635
Think we're liars as well as druggies?

152
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:17,417
Actually, I'm wondering if you'd
mind getting her a cup of ice chips.

153
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:19,468
You're not gonna get
any different answer from her.

154
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,898
No, no. He can stay.

155
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:24,798
No offense, but this place is scary.
I feel better when he's around.

156
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,948
- Tracy, I need to talk to you.
- We don't do a lot of drugs.

157
00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:30,655
I need to know your answers
aren't being pressured.

158
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:34,617
Look, if you think the antibiotics are
a good idea, you can give them to me.

159
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,658
Okay.

160
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,556
Worst case scenario,
it'll help us rule out a few things.

161
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:43,335
He's a good guy. He just has
a hard time holding in his emotions.

162
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:45,226
You don't have to apologize for me.

163
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,967
That mean you're gonna
do it for yourself?

164
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:48,566
I got nothing to apologize for.

165
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:50,028
He's young.

166
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,068
Itchy.

167
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,415
Allergic reaction
to the fluoroquinolone.

168
00:08:57,423 --> 00:08:59,188
We should switch to
a different antibiotic.

169
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,135
Why?

170
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,028
We can't treat the salmonella unless--

171
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:02,975
Salmonella?

172
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,388
That was a total stretch.

173
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,156
Man, why does that sound so familiar?

174
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:07,976
You think it's 'cause
I said it an hour ago?

175
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,376
Then it was a dumb thing to say.
Now it's smart.

176
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,707
She's got the rash,

177
00:09:11,763 --> 00:09:14,576
so we know she's unusually
susceptible to allergic reactions.

178
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,597
So that's what brought her in. Probably
the peanut butter in her sandwich.

179
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,056
Stick test was negative for peanuts.

180
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,807
That's because you foolishly
tested her while she was lying down.

181
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,555
Exercise-based anaphylaxis?
I think that requires exercise.

182
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,717
When her throat closed,
they'd just got done eating.

183
00:09:26,723 --> 00:09:29,286
- Not even competitive eating.
- And getting robbed.

184
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,796
Always gets my heart rate up.

185
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:34,397
Give her the same food she ate at the
diner and stick her on the treadmill.

186
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:36,918
Better yet, put a gun to her head,
threaten to rape her.

187
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:39,128
You don't think I'm
gonna get a response?

188
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:40,077
No.

189
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:41,845
You're on. 50 bucks.

190
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,686
I'm not betting on a patient's--

191
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,877
100 bucks. If you say so.

192
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:57,007
Tracy, I'm increasing
the speed a little.

193
00:09:57,353 --> 00:09:58,897
My stomach really hurts.

194
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:04,117
Jeremy! You out there? Talk to me!

195
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,186
You're doing great.

196
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:06,547
Isn't this enough?

197
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:08,568
I'm not getting any
allergic response yet.

198
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,668
Come on. Shut it off.

199
00:10:09,673 --> 00:10:12,865
We don't complete the test, my boss will
just come down here and do it himself.

200
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:13,856
You do not want that.

201
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:15,627
She's in pain. Look at her.

202
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:17,588
I don't want to have
to ask you to leave.

203
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,177
Ask me to leave?
Are you kidding me?

204
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,777
This is my wife. You guys aren't
helping her. You're hurting her.

205
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:24,848
What? You guys have all this equipment
in here and you're not doing anything.

206
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:26,595
You guys can't figure out what's--

207
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:29,085
Ow, it hurts!

208
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:30,197
Where?

209
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,145
In my stomach.

210
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:32,385
And my chest.

211
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:37,167
It's Foreman. Get me a wheel chair.

212
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:43,967
He's as sick as she is now.

213
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,415
Told you it would work.

214
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,965
Worked on the wrong patient.

215
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,427
We could spend all
day arguing right or wrong.

216
00:10:49,872 --> 00:10:51,015
Give me the 100 bucks.

217
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,067
We didn't bet.

218
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:55,086
We could spend all day
arguing whether we bet or not.

219
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,237
Give me the 100 bucks.

220
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,188
Come on, Foreman. Pay up, he won.

221
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:02,328
Or we could just never finish the DDX.

222
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:06,375
Husband's test showed no MI.

223
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,827
No aortic dissection.
It's not his heart.

224
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,398
It's just non-specific
chest and abdominal pain.

225
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,447
So,

226
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:13,696
psychosomatic?

227
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:15,136
Panic attack?

228
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:18,775
Pain persisted after
he got lorazepam and morphine.

229
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:20,527
Whose locker is that?

230
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:22,518
Mine.

231
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,066
Chest, stomach, throat.

232
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:26,478
What does it all mean?

233
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:28,978
- We're in the nurses' locker room.
- I know that.

234
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:34,126
Oh. That is so annoying.

235
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:37,478
Wilson's girlfriend's left
her stuff in my locker again.

236
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:40,487
Great, I hadn't committed
any felonies yet today.

237
00:11:40,923 --> 00:11:42,625
Relax. You know who they're gonna blame.

238
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:44,978
House, you wanna mess with Wilson,
no problem.

239
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,677
But you got no reason to screw around--

240
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:50,096
- Can we get back to the medicine?
- Okay. Why assume one disease?

241
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:51,478
His chest, her throat.

242
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:55,016
So it's just a coincidence that
they both got crippling stomach pains.

243
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:57,816
Wow, they really are a great couple.
So much in common.

244
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:01,777
One blue shoe.
What do you think that means?

245
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:04,428
It means you're insane.
Wilson's not dating her.

246
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,528
- You feeling luckier?
- It doesn't matter what I answer.

247
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:08,757
200, it is.

248
00:12:08,972 --> 00:12:12,418
If they're married and caught
the same disease, then it means they--

249
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,247
Brochure to a jazz festival
in the Poconos this weekend.

250
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:20,115
Wilson likes jazz. Foreman, pay the man.

251
00:12:20,882 --> 00:12:24,017
Four, five, six novels. No music.

252
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:26,466
- What does that mean?
- She's literate.

253
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:29,376
It means she spends her leisure
time reading, not listening.

254
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:32,626
She'd only wanna go watch jazz
if the other person wanted to go.

255
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,655
She has a martyr complex.
Issues of inferiority.

256
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,538
Married couple. Same disease.

257
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:40,467
They either got it from each other,
or in the same place.

258
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:41,948
Infectious or environmental.

259
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:46,268
All we have to do is check out
parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi,

260
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:48,445
prions, radiation, toxins, chemicals,

261
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:50,387
or it's Internet porn related.

262
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:54,038
I'll check the Internet.
You guys cover the rest of the stuff.

263
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:02,458
If they can live here without killing
each other, they must really be in love.

264
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:03,408
It's tiny.

265
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:06,406
How come it's taking
you so long to search it?

266
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,418
Box of condoms in his jacket.

267
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:12,986
I know you're poor now,
but buy your own.

268
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:13,938
She's on the pill.

269
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:16,147
Why would he need condoms?

270
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:18,595
No,

271
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,065
- put that back.
- Why?

272
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:23,508
We show that to House, he'll
just call the guy a cheating bastard.

273
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,657
- Look how he is with Wilson.
- He'd be right. Could be an STD.

274
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:30,195
One that doesn't give them
any symptoms in their sexual organs?

275
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,158
- They never mentioned anything.
- Maybe they're embarrassed.

276
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:34,216
What else could it be?

277
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:37,377
You think they just like the sexy
feel of latex against their genitals?

278
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,688
Maybe the wife just
wants to be extra cautious.

279
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:42,056
Come on, you really believe that?

280
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,126
- Yeah.
- Good.

281
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,968
Then I'm sure you'll have
no problem convincing House.

282
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,086
That cheating bastard.

283
00:13:51,243 --> 00:13:52,857
- He loves her.
- Right.

284
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:55,886
I bet he told you that
she's the love of his life.

285
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:57,136
People lie, I get it.

286
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,258
But they don't go up against two armed
gunmen to save someone unless they rea--

287
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:04,878
There's a reason that we
don't let kids vote or drink,

288
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:06,295
or work in the salt mines.

289
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,576
They're idiots.

290
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:12,325
20-yo fall in and out of love more often
than they change their oil filters,

291
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,868
- which they should do more often.
- Sorry.

292
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,407
Ridiculous of me to draw a conclusion
based on actually observing them.

293
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:21,345
Should have just depended on
your misanthropic view of human nature.

294
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:23,298
Gonorrhea explains all their symptoms.

295
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:25,546
Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome
for her belly pain,

296
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:28,767
costochondritis and bladder infection
for his chest and abdominal pain.

297
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:29,717
Good.

298
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:33,208
Now go rub their lying,
cheating privates with a cotton swab.

299
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,078
Why would you want to look at her?

300
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,678
Is this because of the condoms?

301
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,396
You found them in his jacket,
figured he was hiding something from me.

302
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,397
I thought I was pregnant last month.
Kind of freaked me out.

303
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:51,996
I'm way too young to have kids.

304
00:14:52,873 --> 00:14:54,918
So you just wanted to be extra cautious.

305
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:57,808
Wish one of us had figured that out,
stuck to his guns.

306
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,695
We're still gonna check you both.

307
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,616
She's the only girlfriend I've ever had.
She's the love of--

308
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:04,696
- Please don't say it.
- I can't say I love my wife?

309
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,325
- We're still gonna test you.
- What is it, I'm white?

310
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,335
Yeah, that's it.

311
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:11,716
Jeremy, I wish you would stop it.
You're really embarrassing.

312
00:15:11,723 --> 00:15:14,555
Everybody thinks they're so liberal,
but I see how they look at us.

313
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:15,518
White and black.

314
00:15:15,863 --> 00:15:16,966
Especially black.

315
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:20,028
I'm sorry, Trace, but it's true.

316
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,538
Great. Prove us all wrong.

317
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,765
No scarring, no purulent discharge,
and the NAATs were negative.

318
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:29,845
They don't have an STD.

319
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,095
What's that you say? You got
a problem with interracial couples?

320
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,648
Thank you, Chase. No.

321
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:36,745
Any of your shorties ever been whities?

322
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:39,345
Not sure I understand your ghetto slang,
Dr. House.

323
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:41,797
How many black women have you dated,
by the way?

324
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,645
I don't care about color. As long as
they can help me breed a superior race.

325
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,986
Yeah, my exes have usually
been black. So what?

326
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,807
It's not a racial thing. It's cultural.
I have more in common with them.

327
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:55,805
Like I assume you only
date emotionally stunted bigots.

328
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,507
Sorry, you're right.
That kind of prejudice is totally fine.

329
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,357
The abdominal pain is getting worse.
We've had to up their morphine twice.

330
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,616
Take the wife off the steroids.
If she spikes a fever,

331
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:09,335
we'll know it's an infection.
If she doesn't, it's environmental.

332
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,155
He got off easy.

333
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:20,095
I almost gave him a colonoscopy.

334
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,635
That was one of the stupidest
things you have ever done,

335
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,485
and there is heavy competition for--

336
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:26,237
What are you doing?

337
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:28,488
Hmm, only ate half your breakfast.

338
00:16:28,651 --> 00:16:30,687
Feeling a little sick this morning?

339
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:32,908
I'm not pregnant. They burnt my omelet.

340
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:36,068
- You need to apologize to this guy.
- I'm a man of principle.

341
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:38,916
I don't care how much time
and money it costs you to defend me.

342
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:40,127
He wants to kill you.

343
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,608
No empty coffee cups.
Off the caffeine. Good for baby.

344
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:46,576
Cups are in the other wastebasket,
baby's in your mind.

345
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:49,025
You can berate patients all you want--

346
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,177
Shoving objects into
their rectums is assault.

347
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:54,038
Pay attention to me.

348
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:57,628
Sorry, that would make
it harder to ignore you.

349
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,437
Can't ignore that rapidly expanding
first trimester ass, though.

350
00:17:01,443 --> 00:17:03,736
Sometimes an ass is just an ass.

351
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,587
You are not always right, House.

352
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,087
Apologize to the guy.

353
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,007
- What are you doing here?
- Stay away from my son.

354
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,075
How did you find us?

355
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:31,445
Stay away from that girl.

356
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,028
Leave him alone!

357
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:40,956
What happened?

358
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:42,406
She's dreaming. She started yelling.

359
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,896
You're breaking Jeremy's arm!

360
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,818
- No one's hurting him.
- Baby, it's me. It's Jeremy.

361
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,985
Tracy, Tracy.

362
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,245
She's okay.

363
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,146
Baby, it was just a bad dream.
Everything's okay.

364
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:55,346
Tracy.

365
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:57,536
Tracy?

366
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,397
It was an acute delirium.

367
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:10,955
Well, she's talking, right?

368
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,776
I mean, she's coming out of it.

369
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,088
She's not really talking.
Just making sounds.

370
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:17,476
Okay, when is she gonna come out?

371
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:18,546
Jeremy...

372
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:20,577
She's in a coma.

373
00:18:28,614 --> 00:18:30,258
So her vitals are pretty stable.

374
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:33,339
But her response to
stimuli is getting weaker,

375
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:35,717
which means the coma is getting worse.

376
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,470
Her brain is slowly shutting down.

377
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:39,340
Can I see her?

378
00:18:40,103 --> 00:18:43,399
We're getting some more images
to check for masses or infections.

379
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:46,828
I'll increase your morphine.

380
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:49,178
Her hallucination.

381
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,667
If you knew what it was,

382
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:54,368
would that make any difference?

383
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:56,527
Medically, I mean.

384
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:58,277
Not usually.

385
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:00,829
Some cases, the form of a hallucination

386
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:03,480
can tell us what part
of the brain is being hit.

387
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:05,659
I think it was about my dad.

388
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,140
Your...

389
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:08,959
your dad was breaking your arm?

390
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:11,478
He was a

391
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:12,947
drunk,

392
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:14,518
pill-popping racist.

393
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:18,339
He caught me sneaking
into her house when we were 13.

394
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:19,987
She lived next door.

395
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:24,649
He broke my arm and threatened her.

396
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:27,939
We ran off when we were 16.

397
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:30,670
You still in touch with him?

398
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:33,870
Killed himself a couple of years ago.

399
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:41,360
It's not medical, I just
thought blacks were the racist ones.

400
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,898
Some generalized edema throughout.

401
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:54,799
And areas of increased signal here,
here, here, and here.

402
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:55,990
Damn.

403
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:57,250
All over her brain stem.

404
00:19:57,632 --> 00:20:00,377
Could be plaques,
maybe hyperdensities from the edema.

405
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:01,828
Or tumors or anything.

406
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:05,860
We add brain involvement to the chest,
stomach, throat. What do we got?

407
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:09,027
Didn't spike a fever when we took off
the steroids, so it's not an infection.

408
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:10,937
Leaving environmental. What flavor?

409
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:12,589
Environmental doesn't make sense either.

410
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:14,430
If it's a toxin,
we'd see it in their livers.

411
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:16,329
None of the neighbors are sick,
no co-workers--

412
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:17,277
They both got it.

413
00:20:17,664 --> 00:20:20,467
Means infection or environmental,
and since it's not an infection...

414
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:22,117
What if they didn't both get it?

415
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:25,850
Maybe we got our basic assumption wrong,
and it's two different diseases.

416
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:26,799
Maybe we didn't

417
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:29,170
and it's sarcoidosis.

418
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:31,747
Sarcoidosis isn't
infectious or environmental.

419
00:20:31,904 --> 00:20:34,298
Tell that to the clusters
of sarcoidosis cases.

420
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,778
Fire fighters and residents
of pine tar forests?

421
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:41,188
I did see these two putting
out that blaze in the Pine Barrens.

422
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:45,689
If sarcoidosis has two environmental
causes, it has environmental causes.

423
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:47,870
We just don't know all of them yet.

424
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:49,109
Husband's chest.

425
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:53,070
He has slightly enlarged
hilar lymph nodes.

426
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:56,600
Sarcoidosis explains
almost all of their symptoms.

427
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,039
Including her getting
worse off the steroids.

428
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:02,278
- Doesn't explain his throat swelling.
- That's what "almost" means.

429
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:04,568
90% of sarcoidosis
cases have lung scarring.

430
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,398
- Oh, 90?
- Oh, "almost."

431
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:09,648
Fine.

432
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:12,910
Consult a specialist.

433
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:25,538
If this is more dating advice...

434
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:26,620
Love to gossip,

435
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:28,028
but I got work to do.

436
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:30,209
This sarcoidosis?

437
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:35,089
It's pretty non-specific.

438
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:36,558
Could be granulomas,

439
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:38,647
could be plaques.

440
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:40,077
What's this?

441
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:43,710
You stole Wendy's personnel file?

442
00:21:43,973 --> 00:21:44,919
In a way,

443
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:47,699
aren't we all guilty
of bribing the janitor

444
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:49,278
to take her file and give it to me?

445
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:52,218
Yes, I take my share of the blame.
But society's--

446
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:53,928
First of all, I'm not dating her.

447
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:55,349
She is so wrong for you.

448
00:21:56,344 --> 00:21:59,989
You know, she filed a form so the
hospital would take extra withholding.

449
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:01,298
Who does that?

450
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:03,897
She's much too cautious for me.
Point taken. I'll--

451
00:22:04,512 --> 00:22:08,110
I'll start dating her, so I can break
up with her and start dating a stripper.

452
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:11,047
You're a miserable jerk
who can't stand to be alone.

453
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:13,368
I didn't try to break up your marriages.

454
00:22:13,384 --> 00:22:14,469
You did that yourself.

455
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:17,770
My marriages were so crappy,
I was spending all my time with you.

456
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:20,229
Your real fear is me
having a good relationship.

457
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:21,977
Yes. It keeps me up at night.

458
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:23,810
That, and the Loch Ness monster,

459
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:26,800
global warming,
evolution, and other fictional concepts.

460
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:31,199
Although, big romantic weekend
in the Poconos could change everything.

461
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:36,629
You don't mean...

462
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:37,709
No.

463
00:22:38,895 --> 00:22:40,490
I don't think it's sarcoidosis.

464
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:47,200
He says it's sarcoidosis.

465
00:22:47,944 --> 00:22:49,540
Start them both on methotrexate

466
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:52,210
- And if you're wrong?
- If Wilson's wrong...

467
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:55,239
We'll biopsy her just to be sure.

468
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:56,400
Her brain stem?

469
00:22:56,845 --> 00:22:59,237
Brain damage is not only possible,
it's likely.

470
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,800
Good point.
Let's biopsy something safer. Like

471
00:23:02,285 --> 00:23:03,228
her shoes.

472
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:06,869
The husband,

473
00:23:07,115 --> 00:23:08,458
he'd have to give consent.

474
00:23:08,843 --> 00:23:10,267
- He can't right now.
- Why?

475
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:11,958
This guy write with his stomach?

476
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:13,509
He has a conflict of interest.

477
00:23:13,665 --> 00:23:16,600
It's not his brain we're cutting open.
But he still gets all the benefit.

478
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,079
- He'd do it just to save himself.
- Or save her.

479
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:22,199
- She's the love of his life, remember?
- He never said that.

480
00:23:22,205 --> 00:23:23,747
She needs a guardian ad litem.

481
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:25,419
I can't let you do this.

482
00:23:25,515 --> 00:23:26,777
How are you gonna stop me?

483
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:27,729
Call Cuddy?

484
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:30,978
- Cameron's right. There's a conflict.
- No, there isn't.

485
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:33,797
Not unless one of them wants
to die a horrible, painful death.

486
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,557
I'm sure the guardian
will figure that out.

487
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:36,729
In a couple days.

488
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:39,260
Will the guardian convince
the disease to hold off

489
00:23:39,263 --> 00:23:42,160
eating her brain so we can
get the legalities worked out?

490
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:45,258
I just don't want some plaintiff's
lawyer owning my hospital.

491
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:46,278
Legalities help.

492
00:23:47,214 --> 00:23:49,520
Speaking of which,
did you get your thermometer back yet?

493
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:50,717
Oh, we had a nice chat.

494
00:23:51,245 --> 00:23:52,740
Did you know he's a Rotarian?

495
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:55,898
Listen, she'll die without the biopsy.

496
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:58,999
I need to cover the hospital's ass.

497
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,579
You're too biased.

498
00:24:00,955 --> 00:24:03,347
I send you in there,
you'll steamroll over him.

499
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:06,589
Something goes wrong, he'll
sue us for not disclosing the risks.

500
00:24:06,594 --> 00:24:08,489
Then have Wilson talk to the husband.

501
00:24:08,495 --> 00:24:11,389
Wilson kills people left and right,
no one ever sues him.

502
00:24:12,804 --> 00:24:15,348
Fine. But only if you
apologize to the clinic guy.

503
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:16,337
Nah.

504
00:24:16,345 --> 00:24:18,168
Probably better to
just let that couple die.

505
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:19,619
I don't care if you mean it,

506
00:24:19,782 --> 00:24:20,727
just do it.

507
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,878
Unfortunately,
we don't see any way around a biopsy.

508
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:29,480
We'll do all we can
to minimize any damage.

509
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:30,747
No.

510
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:33,507
The methotrexate isn't
showing any effects yet.

511
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:35,778
- You could both be--
- She's brilliant.

512
00:24:36,905 --> 00:24:39,260
All As in college
while working full time.

513
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:42,928
- I can't do that to her.
- And if you both die?

514
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:44,938
You think she'd want that?

515
00:24:47,643 --> 00:24:48,709
Do it on me instead.

516
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,270
- It's not in your brain.
- It will be.

517
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:53,869
It's the same disease, right?
Do it then.

518
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:57,458
She could die before
you show the symptoms.

519
00:24:57,934 --> 00:24:59,169
Then stop treating me.

520
00:25:02,874 --> 00:25:03,877
Great job.

521
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:05,779
Why didn't you just
shoot him in the head?

522
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:08,269
That gives me an idea.
You know what could save this couple?

523
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:10,158
- Lots of misdirected sarcasm.
- They're dead.

524
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:12,807
Yelling at you might prevent
you from screwing up like this again.

525
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:15,317
- I didn't. I did my job.
- Your job was to get me the biopsy.

526
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:17,270
It was to present the patient
with his options.

527
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:20,460
Two options: biopsy or no biopsy.
He chose a third, no treatment.

528
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:22,350
- How do you even do that?
- Remember when

529
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:25,639
you used to just weave elaborate
conspiracy theories about my love life?

530
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,117
Those were such good times.

531
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:32,870
How much morphine is the husband on?

532
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:35,967
We can't increase it anymore.
His respirations are depressed.

533
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,097
Increase it?
Drugs cloud people's judgment.

534
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,107
Cold turkey the sucker.

535
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,347
Uh... no.

536
00:25:45,342 --> 00:25:46,288
Good point.

537
00:25:58,363 --> 00:25:59,868
Did I ask you guys to follow me?

538
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:01,647
No. Which made us nervous.

539
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:04,968
He'll catch on if he notices
he's off the morphine drip.

540
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,369
Shoot him up with one
of these puppies instead.

541
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:08,908
No.

542
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:10,618
You do understand
it's not really a puppy.

543
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:12,927
- It's naloxone.
- An opiate-blocker?

544
00:26:13,473 --> 00:26:15,308
He'll feel like he's
swallowing a bonfire.

545
00:26:15,314 --> 00:26:16,997
That's pretty unethical even for you.

546
00:26:17,003 --> 00:26:18,960
How is that unethical?
It'll lead to a diagnosis.

547
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:21,150
It's leading to the torture of
the husband on the off-chance

548
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:22,847
he'll allow a procedure
on another person.

549
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:25,090
Which will lead to a diagnosis.
Didn't I just say that?

550
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:25,937
Give it up.

551
00:26:25,943 --> 00:26:28,839
Foreman and Cameron are too ethical,
and I'm too scared of getting sued.

552
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:29,788
Fine.

553
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm just gonna...

554
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,470
find some place safe to hide this.

555
00:26:32,494 --> 00:26:34,018
So I won't be tempted to use it.

556
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,417
You're not doing it either.

557
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:37,960
What, are you gonna run for it?

558
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:40,800
If they die now,

559
00:26:41,753 --> 00:26:44,697
they'll never be able to
grow old and tired of each other.

560
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:55,519
We can't baby-sit House all day.

561
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,020
I'll tell Cuddy to
put a nurse by his room.

562
00:26:58,263 --> 00:26:59,207
Damn it.

563
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:03,719
Atropine?

564
00:27:03,992 --> 00:27:04,988
What happened to--?

565
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:08,047
He knew we'd stop him.

566
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:10,159
He stuck both of them in his pocket.

567
00:27:11,323 --> 00:27:12,867
That's actually pretty clever.

568
00:27:16,654 --> 00:27:18,698
Guess I can't use that trick again, huh?

569
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:20,467
Oh, my stomach!

570
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:25,229
It was a pretty smart plan, Jerry.

571
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:26,640
But I'm on to you.

572
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:29,538
There's only one good
reason to kill the biopsy.

573
00:27:29,622 --> 00:27:32,810
You poisoned your wife, and
you don't want the coppers to get wise.

574
00:27:32,812 --> 00:27:33,760
No!

575
00:27:34,224 --> 00:27:36,209
Oh, all right. Then you're just a moron.

576
00:27:36,212 --> 00:27:37,157
Biopsy me.

577
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:40,287
Only if this thing hits your brain,
you moron.

578
00:27:40,924 --> 00:27:43,170
And I can't stress
that "moron" part enough.

579
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:44,577
You're killing your wife.

580
00:27:44,604 --> 00:27:46,000
She is the love of my life.

581
00:27:47,644 --> 00:27:50,220
Careful--once she's dead
and you're on wife number two,

582
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,608
you're gonna feel real
guilty about saying that.

583
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,324
Feel that?

584
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,424
Get used to it.

585
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,393
- Pain's gonna get a lot worse.
- No, it won't.

586
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,614
Morphine just isn't working
right now for some reason.

587
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,134
I'm putting you on a tranquilizer
in the meantime. It'll work again soon.

588
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,085
Wanna bet?

589
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,005
I don't care about the pain.

590
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:09,753
I need to be in pain,

591
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:13,024
because I have to get worse.
Means you can do the biopsy on me.

592
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:16,083
Dude, she's in a coma.
Who are you trying to impress?

593
00:28:16,818 --> 00:28:18,005
I'd die for her.

594
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,366
Give up.

595
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,715
Or we can wait for him
to get all grown-up and cynical.

596
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:30,545
I was just gonna call you.

597
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:33,096
I need a court order
to biopsy this woman's brain.

598
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,644
Speaking of litigation...

599
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,543
Michael Tritter.

600
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:39,986
You know Dr. House.

601
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,593
You guys can talk here.

602
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,793
I don't want to sue you.

603
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,214
Good.

604
00:28:51,221 --> 00:28:52,916
I wanna beat the crap out of you.

605
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:54,376
Less good.

606
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:55,565
And I'll tell you why.

607
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,264
You're a bully.

608
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:01,495
And

609
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:03,274
bullies, they don't back down.

610
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,236
Until they run into
someone stronger and meaner.

611
00:29:07,338 --> 00:29:08,834
But you'll accept an apology.

612
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,525
Yes.

613
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,536
Not really a recipe for sincerity.

614
00:29:13,578 --> 00:29:15,124
I'm not looking for sincerity.

615
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:16,584
I'm looking for humiliation.

616
00:29:17,248 --> 00:29:18,454
Something that will make you

617
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,304
think twice before you
treat the next patient like crap.

618
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:24,025
Here's what's gonna happen.

619
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:26,294
You go brag to your friends

620
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:29,013
about how you made the big
nasty doctor poop in his pants.

621
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:32,264
I get Cuddy off my back by
telling her that I humiliated myself.

622
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,463
Here's the catch:

623
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,506
We're both gonna be lying.

624
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:38,505
I'm not apologizing.

625
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,305
If anything,
you deserved a bigger thermometer.

626
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:53,026
- What's wrong?
- Jeremy's worse.

627
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,356
Then that's what's right.

628
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:57,465
Cut the stubborn jerk's
head open and take a slice.

629
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:01,465
It's not his brain. Lactic acid's
up to 39. His intestines are rotting.

630
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,934
This isn't sarcoidosis.

631
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:05,225
Well, he'll get his wish.

632
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:07,935
He's dying.

633
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,785
It's just not in a way
that's gonna help his wife.

634
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,940
Coma's worse.
She's losing response to stimuli.

635
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:18,558
He's vomiting blood,
and his lactic acid's 45.

636
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:20,738
- He's gotta have ischemic bowel.
- So what?

637
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:23,990
Well, let's see, lack of blood
flow is causing his guts to die,

638
00:30:23,993 --> 00:30:25,249
which will cause him to die,

639
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:28,110
unless we cut out a few feet of
small intestine and reattach the ends--

640
00:30:28,113 --> 00:30:29,561
I don't know. Seems worth a mention.

641
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:31,471
Why does he have it?
What does it tell us?

642
00:30:31,474 --> 00:30:32,621
Small cell vasculitis?

643
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:34,260
Good, now let's hear it again,

644
00:30:34,263 --> 00:30:36,791
but this time with a more
environmental or infectious feeling.

645
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:40,239
Or, like I said before, it might
not be environmental or infectious.

646
00:30:40,435 --> 00:30:42,329
He has vasculitis. She has porphyria.

647
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:44,909
Belly pain plus hallucinations:
classic symptoms.

648
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:46,450
Could even cause a coma.

649
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:49,291
Fine.

650
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:51,089
Start her on hematin for porphyria.

651
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:52,290
What about him?

652
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:54,878
Take out the dead bowel.
That's all we can do.

653
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:55,938
And biopsy it.

654
00:30:55,944 --> 00:30:58,270
If Foreman's right, it might save him.
If Foreman's wrong,

655
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:00,068
dead bowel might save both of them.

656
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:06,739
Bowel's not dead.

657
00:31:06,943 --> 00:31:10,898
Unless he's been tossing down frosty
cans of lactic acid, the bowel is dead.

658
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:13,159
What we're looking
for is a reason it's dead.

659
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,109
Bowel's not dead.

660
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:16,301
Just general swelling and edema.

661
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,948
High lactate was probably from stress.

662
00:31:19,134 --> 00:31:22,230
We just sliced him open from
chest to pubic bone for nothing.

663
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:25,671
Nothing is something.

664
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:28,071
Forget the ischemia.

665
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:30,048
Add the edema and swelling.

666
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:31,878
Probably from cutting him open.

667
00:31:31,944 --> 00:31:33,241
Probably, not definitely.

668
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:36,720
Okay, back to the beginning.
What did we talk about?

669
00:31:36,743 --> 00:31:38,240
Anything. I wanna hear it all again.

670
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:40,150
Allergies. Doesn't fit at all now.

671
00:31:40,513 --> 00:31:42,329
STDs--maybe we got the wrong one.

672
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:43,981
What about syphilis?

673
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:46,361
- Neurological symptoms--
- He wasn't cheating on her.

674
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,700
Yeah, yeah, "love of his life."

675
00:31:47,814 --> 00:31:49,318
Don't you have to wait until he's dead

676
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,271
- before you make that determination?
- She's his only girlfriend ever.

677
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:55,378
They grew up next door,
they ran off together as teenagers.

678
00:31:56,094 --> 00:31:58,878
Sarcoidosis--we only ruled it
out 'cause we thought he had ischemic--

679
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,831
- Why did they run off?
- What difference does--

680
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,909
Kids talk about running off.
How many do it?

681
00:32:02,914 --> 00:32:03,918
What was the reason?

682
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:06,830
They were trying to escape his evil,
pill-popping, racist dad.

683
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:08,030
You would've liked him.

684
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:10,829
- We should do another biopsy--
- How do you know the dad was racist?

685
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:14,289
He beat up his son for dating
a black girl. I extrapolated from that.

686
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:15,641
You see racism everywhere.

687
00:32:17,053 --> 00:32:19,199
Maybe he just didn't
like this black girl.

688
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:21,500
It's not sarcoid.
We would have seen granulomas in his--

689
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,670
She has pretty eyes.

690
00:32:27,003 --> 00:32:27,989
Forget infectious.

691
00:32:29,025 --> 00:32:30,119
Forget environmental.

692
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:34,560
Defective DNA is keeping
them from making a critical protein.

693
00:32:35,236 --> 00:32:36,480
Hence the fluid buildup.

694
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,731
It's the throat,
stomach, chest and brain.

695
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:42,570
- Angioedema?
- Hereditary angioedema.

696
00:32:43,654 --> 00:32:45,100
Symptoms fit perfectly.

697
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:47,440
It's an incredibly rare disease.

698
00:32:47,854 --> 00:32:49,409
They both would have to have a parent--

699
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:51,899
Is it a coincidence that
your sister has great hair?

700
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:54,971
Or that these two have green eyes?

701
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:58,489
You're not saying...

702
00:32:58,855 --> 00:32:59,689
They're not

703
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:00,691
brother and sister.

704
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:02,750
Ew. God, no.

705
00:33:03,095 --> 00:33:04,088
That would be sick.

706
00:33:05,146 --> 00:33:06,390
Half-brother and sister.

707
00:33:07,323 --> 00:33:08,269
Different moms.

708
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,649
Dad must have had
an affair with her mom.

709
00:33:12,415 --> 00:33:14,620
That's why he flipped out
when the kids started dating.

710
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:16,718
He had it himself.
Probably why the pills.

711
00:33:16,723 --> 00:33:17,809
We don't know for sure.

712
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:20,691
Testing for HAE or paternity
is gonna take a day.

713
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:22,621
She doesn't have a day.

714
00:33:22,945 --> 00:33:24,790
Start treating and see what happens.

715
00:33:33,174 --> 00:33:34,119
Any change?

716
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,691
Her response to stimuli
is still just as weak.

717
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:38,910
I almost hope she stays in a coma.

718
00:33:40,055 --> 00:33:41,061
That's sweet, Cameron.

719
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:43,048
I'd like to avoid shattering
both of their lives.

720
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:44,848
You don't think dying will do that?

721
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:53,391
It's just her oximeter.

722
00:33:58,996 --> 00:33:59,940
Tracy.

723
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:02,298
Tracy.

724
00:34:05,606 --> 00:34:06,551
She's awake.

725
00:34:11,825 --> 00:34:12,931
Oh, God, baby.

726
00:34:14,445 --> 00:34:15,538
It's gonna be okay.

727
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:22,120
Awesome!

728
00:34:22,404 --> 00:34:23,338
Can I tell them?

729
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:26,088
We've obviously got to
let them know what's wrong. But

730
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:29,118
the cause, the brother-sister thing...

731
00:34:29,973 --> 00:34:30,920
Good plan.

732
00:34:31,214 --> 00:34:32,870
You just got to keep them away from...

733
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:36,259
doctors, the Internet,
and anyone who's not a total moron.

734
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:38,311
Tell them.

735
00:34:38,353 --> 00:34:40,720
Yesterday,
he was willing to die to save her.

736
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:42,980
We've got to give them time to recover.

737
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:44,778
He might be a little vexed

738
00:34:44,986 --> 00:34:47,720
that you kept letting him hump
his sister in the meantime.

739
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:48,949
Tell them.

740
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:53,109
Unless their dad was also
the product of an incestuous union,

741
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:55,700
the chances of serious
complications are minimal.

742
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,470
Noble of you to take that risk.

743
00:34:58,323 --> 00:35:00,191
Tell them or I will.

744
00:35:03,746 --> 00:35:05,588
So we just need to take these pills.

745
00:35:06,144 --> 00:35:07,088
Twice a day.

746
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:09,781
Angioedema's very treatable.
You'll be fine.

747
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:11,831
So, what?

748
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:13,808
We, like, caught this from each other?

749
00:35:14,294 --> 00:35:15,240
No.

750
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:17,369
It's a condition you both always had.

751
00:35:18,456 --> 00:35:21,650
The onset of symptoms are
sometimes caused by stress or trauma.

752
00:35:21,874 --> 00:35:24,468
- The incident at the diner.
- So we got it as kids?

753
00:35:25,214 --> 00:35:26,158
It's, um...

754
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,391
It's a genetic disease. It's not--

755
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:35,601
There's no good reason two
unrelated people would get it.

756
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:40,560
We think you guys
should take a DNA test.

757
00:35:43,765 --> 00:35:45,718
How can we be related?

758
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:51,760
We think you have the same dad.

759
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:56,701
We don't know for sure
until we do the tests.

760
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:57,728
Oh, God.

761
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:06,890
- Your father...
- No.

762
00:36:07,564 --> 00:36:09,198
No. This can't-- this can't be true.

763
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:10,149
Yeah, yeah--

764
00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:12,381
Jer, Jer, I'm lighter--

765
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,841
You know,
I'm lighter than both my parents.

766
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:18,321
And our eyes. Everyone always
talks about how we have the same eyes.

767
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:21,058
You're not really siblings.

768
00:36:25,034 --> 00:36:26,579
We have the same father!

769
00:36:28,123 --> 00:36:29,071
You didn't

770
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,491
fight in the backseat on car trips.
You didn't

771
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:34,191
change each other's diapers.
You guys just...

772
00:36:35,075 --> 00:36:36,771
met and fell in love.

773
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:41,228
The--the way you feel-- that...

774
00:36:42,454 --> 00:36:43,400
hasn't changed.

775
00:37:12,945 --> 00:37:16,389
Hey Foreman, can you wear the beeper
for a couple of hours this weekend?

776
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:17,338
What?

777
00:37:17,823 --> 00:37:19,721
We just destroyed two people's lives.

778
00:37:19,735 --> 00:37:21,460
I'm not allowed to run errands anymore?

779
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:23,360
I'd like to see some
sign that it affects you,

780
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:25,428
or that you recognize
it affects other people.

781
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:27,121
So are you gonna wear the beeper or not?

782
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:28,070
Sorry, I can't.

783
00:37:30,156 --> 00:37:31,548
You just want to punish me.

784
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:34,181
I'm busy.

785
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:35,988
With what?

786
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:38,081
I'm going out of town.

787
00:37:41,073 --> 00:37:42,121
Where are you going?

788
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:46,148
Foreman...

789
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:49,391
You're not missing a blue shoe, are you?

790
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:56,101
Come--

791
00:37:57,033 --> 00:37:59,579
You can't bet when you
know the answer beforehand.

792
00:37:59,994 --> 00:38:03,111
We could spend all day arguing
whether you can bet when you know

793
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:05,411
the answer beforehand.
Give me the 200 bucks.

794
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:22,178
What?

795
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:41,008
You okay?

796
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:42,920
I was just wondering.

797
00:38:43,593 --> 00:38:44,691
You really like jazz?

798
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:46,358
I love it.

799
00:38:47,955 --> 00:38:48,899
Are you lying?

800
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:51,768
I'm lying.

801
00:38:55,173 --> 00:38:56,719
I want to spend time with you.

802
00:38:57,744 --> 00:38:58,789
Is that so terrible?

803
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:01,490
No.

804
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:08,481
Maybe we shouldn't walk out together.

805
00:39:09,156 --> 00:39:10,400
People see us leaving...

806
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:12,460
They gotta find out sometime.

807
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:21,530
Let me just meet you at your place.

808
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:35,330
She got her own room.

809
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,238
She just...

810
00:39:40,174 --> 00:39:41,320
needs some time alone.

811
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:50,268
You want me to hang out here a bit?

812
00:41:24,135 --> 00:41:26,568
If you've come to return
the thermometer, don't bother.

813
00:41:26,573 --> 00:41:27,531
I've moved on.

814
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,480
If you'd actually read my chart,

815
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,969
you'd have known that I'm a cop.

816
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:34,318
You were going 40

817
00:41:34,955 --> 00:41:36,051
in a 25 zone.

818
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,808
Oh, come on.

819
00:41:39,284 --> 00:41:42,308
This isn't because I was speeding.
This is because I'm Latino.

820
00:41:42,315 --> 00:41:44,461
License,
registration, proof of insurance.

821
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:47,891
Sorry. Cool jacket.
Only pockets for important stuff.

822
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:49,250
That's a shame.

823
00:41:51,214 --> 00:41:52,388
50 buck ticket.

824
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:54,958
Is that your way of beating me up?

825
00:41:55,275 --> 00:41:57,578
Or is that just the price
for sticking something in you?

826
00:41:57,584 --> 00:41:59,278
You took a pill while you were...

827
00:41:59,356 --> 00:42:03,141
examining a patient.
That's serious addictive behavior.

828
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:08,521
I'm betting that you're
holding right now.

829
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:12,420
I wasn't weaving, I'm not drunk.

830
00:42:12,914 --> 00:42:15,161
- You've got no reason to--
- Pupils dilated.

831
00:42:16,003 --> 00:42:18,501
Appeared to be under
the influence of a narcotic.

832
00:42:18,906 --> 00:42:22,699
Would you mind turning around, please,
putting your hands behind your head?

833
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:25,450
Does that polite crap
ever work on people?

834
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:29,358
Most people...

835
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,849
realize there's only one answer.

836
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:42,790
You got a prescription?

837
00:42:42,806 --> 00:42:44,890
I'm a cripple who works in a hospital.

838
00:42:45,256 --> 00:42:47,229
You don't think I can
get a valid prescription?

839
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:48,938
Arrogant son of a bitch like you?

840
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:50,731
I bet you didn't bother.

841
00:42:51,745 --> 00:42:53,171
You are under arrest...

842
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:55,379
for possession...

843
00:42:56,606 --> 00:42:57,549
of narcotics.

844
00:42:58,555 --> 00:43:00,400
You have the right to remain silent,

845
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,641
which you should take advantage
of for once in your life.

846
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,080
If you give up the
right to remain silent,

847
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,730
anything you say can and
will be used against you...

848
10:00:00,000 --> 10:00:01,000
