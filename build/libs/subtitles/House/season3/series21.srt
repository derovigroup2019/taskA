1
00:00:01,763 --> 00:00:03,755
Try not to be scared
when you see him, okay?

2
00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:05,006
Mom, I've seen him sick.

3
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:06,718
I'm not scared.

4
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:08,162
This time's different.

5
00:00:08,202 --> 00:00:10,781
The doctors gave him an extra
course of radiation and chemo...

6
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:11,732
I know.

7
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:15,076
And you understand how
proud we are of you, right?

8
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:17,966
Gloves, mask.

9
00:00:58,137 --> 00:01:01,637
Matty. You said you wanted to
see your brother before the procedure.

10
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:04,334
I know I look like an alien,

11
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:07,018
but I promise not to eat your brain.

12
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,365
When this is done, will you
be able to play out back with me?

13
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:16,546
I'll rip anything you
put near the strike zone.

14
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:20,394
Let your brother rest up
while we take some of your marrow.

15
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:30,618
You don't need to
be in an isolation room,

16
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,919
but I pulled some strings so
you'd be next door to your brother.

17
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:35,657
How many games will I miss?

18
00:01:35,683 --> 00:01:37,147
You only have
to be here overnight,

19
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:39,167
but you do have to take
it easy for a little bit.

20
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:41,380
- I already missed two.
- I know. It's okay.

21
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:46,148
Must've been a drag. We just had to make
sure you weren't exposed to any bugs.

22
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:50,149
Cause your healthy bone marrow is what's
gonna cure your brother's leukemia...

24
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,159
Come on.

25
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:30,008
He sneezed. Maybe it's just an allergy.

26
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:32,984
Not with an enlarged spleen and a fever.

27
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:35,775
He's got one of 10,000
possible infections.

28
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:39,530
Even if it's just the common cold, I
do the transplant, he kills his brother.

29
00:03:39,531 --> 00:03:40,534
How long do we have?

30
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:42,523
Radiation obliterated his immune system.

31
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:44,446
Even in a clean room, he's got...

32
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,951
four, maybe five days left.

33
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:50,226
No way we can solve this that fast.
You need to find another donor.

34
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:53,560
They're African-American. It makes it
nearly impossible to find a full match.

35
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:57,061
Tell me about it. I can't even
find the one I've got working for me.

36
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:58,039
Where's Foreman?

37
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,078
Nothing like a dead patient to
send you back to your choir boy roots.

38
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:14,722
You're not gonna believe what happened.

39
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:17,046
Wilson just killed
a kid the same way you did.

40
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:19,876
- He's not dead.
- Five days are gonna fly by.

41
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:22,141
He didn't look both
ways before he nuked.

42
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:25,286
You done talking to
your imaginary friend?

43
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:27,191
'Cause I thought maybe
you could do your job.

44
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:30,427
We should start the donor brother
on broad spectrum antibiotics.

45
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:33,278
Great idea, if you're looking
to save exactly one kid.

46
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:36,782
Broad spec will take at least
a week to work. We need narrow spec.

47
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:39,364
- How old is Hector?
- Our patient's name is Matty.

48
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:41,293
- His brother's Nick.
- Hector's my dog.

49
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:44,157
- He's about 17.
- 17? That's like...

50
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,744
119 in human years.
Why is he still alive?

51
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:50,645
Five days minus 20 seconds
talking about Wilson's dog.

52
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:54,407
We need to start testing. Stool
samples for parasites, antibody tests...

53
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:56,531
Blood panel was negative
for all the usual suspects.

54
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:58,560
That's 'cause the
infection is too small.

55
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:01,378
We start testing now, it's like
looking for a needle in a haystack.

56
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,379
We draw blood, odds are
we're just gonna come up with hay.

57
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:05,882
We need to grow more needles.

58
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,609
Okay, that probably
needs further explanation.

59
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:14,643
We make the donor kid sicker.

60
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:17,500
We freeze him, we soak him,
break down his immune system.

61
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:20,974
Suddenly we're looking at some needle
a camel can pass through the eye of.

62
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:23,985
Making him sicker risks spreading
the infection all throughout his body.

63
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:25,427
True, but who cares?

64
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:28,353
Once we know what the infection is,
we'll know exactly how to treat it.

65
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:30,007
As long as he isn't dead yet,
we're cool.

66
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:31,695
We should do what we normally do...

67
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:33,925
go to the kid's house,
check for sources of infection.

68
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:34,876
Waste of time.

69
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:38,082
You think it's in the house.
I know it's in the patient.

70
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,533
Safer than intentionally
making the kid sicker.

71
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:42,992
Fine. Go.

72
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,497
So exactly how sick
are you gonna make Matty?

73
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:55,631
He could get quite ill.

74
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:58,875
This certainly won't be a pleasant
experience for anyone, but it's our...

75
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:01,376
Ever get caught in the
rain without an umbrella?

76
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:03,754
That's all we're talking about here...
sign the form.

77
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:07,609
It's a little more complicated than
that. We'll also be doing leukopheresis.

78
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,767
We run Matty's blood through a machine
that filters out his white blood cells.

79
00:06:10,768 --> 00:06:13,379
But without his white cells,
how can he get better in time?

80
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,187
We'll pump the white blood cells
back as soon as we have a diagnosis.

81
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:19,204
Then we should be able to cure the
infection in time to do the transplant.

82
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:23,175
- But you can't guarantee?
- We're not GM. No recalls, no rebates.

83
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,469
Any more questions while
your son's life slips away?

84
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,593
- You really think we should do this?
- Yes.

85
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:38,275
Sorry. Your patient. You tell them.

86
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:44,767
This is your family.
It needs to be your decision.

87
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:55,928
All you had to do was say, "Yes, I do."

88
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:58,953
God knows that's a phrase you've
used often enough in your life.

89
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:02,054
It was a mistake every time.
Give it a break. They said yes.

90
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,949
That's not enough for you. You
need them to feel good about saying yes.

91
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,309
I treat patients for months,
maybe years, not weeks like you.

92
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,689
I'm taller.

93
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,504
If they don't trust me,
I can't do my job.

94
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:14,387
The only value of that
trust is you can manipulate them.

95
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:15,770
You should write greeting cards.

96
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:18,407
Giving parents the chance to
make a bad choice was a bad choice.

97
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:19,998
At least it would've been their choice.

98
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:22,149
One they'd regret
at their son's funeral.

99
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,583
Kitchen and bathrooms were immaculate.

100
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:28,070
Whatever the kid's got,
he didn't get here.

101
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:31,821
No, whatever the kid got, he didn't
get from the kitchen or the bathroom.

102
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:34,157
- Nobody cleans swing sets.
- Yeah.

103
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:37,659
Because their kid's ten and
hasn't used it since he was six.

104
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,460
You obviously think your time could
be better spent. Why'd you come along?

105
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,656
I feel bad about
what happened last week.

106
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:45,607
I'm handling it.

107
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,751
You think the family's gonna sue?

108
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:49,941
She only had her grandparents
and they weren't close.

109
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,742
Well, that's good. For you, I mean.

110
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:55,017
A lawsuit makes it even
harder to put behind you.

111
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:56,373
You put yours behind you?

112
00:07:58,065 --> 00:07:59,015
No.

113
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:04,088
When I woke up this morning I,

114
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:07,714
I couldn't remember what
she was wearing when I admitted her.

115
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:08,581
Memories fade.

116
00:08:08,582 --> 00:08:11,687
I killed her a week ago and I can't
remember what color top she was wearing.

117
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:14,738
I was grateful when I could
wake up not thinking about her.

118
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:16,655
I'm not like you.

119
00:08:16,794 --> 00:08:20,363
Your patient died because you were
distracted over the death of your dad.

120
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:21,864
I made a calculated decision.

121
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:26,272
You acted like a human being.
I acted like...

122
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:28,812
House.

123
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,020
It could be mucor or
strongyloides in this dirt.

124
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,412
No pulmonary symptoms.

125
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:46,823
He's setting well, breathing easily.

126
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:08,515
Mom, I'm freezing.

127
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,607
How long... do I have to...

128
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:18,101
Matty, we found an old
water pump in your backyard.

129
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:20,883
- You ever drink from it?
- Yeah, it was gross.

130
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:23,489
We gotta test for Mycobacteria,
leptospirosis.

131
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,890
- When did you drink the water?
- Last summer?

132
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,893
You sure? You haven't
even taken a sip to cool off?

133
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:33,211
It was really gross.

134
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:37,136
My shoulder's bugging me.
Does that matter?

135
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:39,837
It could.
Did you do anything to hurt it?

136
00:09:40,138 --> 00:09:43,438
Just threw the ball around
the other day. For a couple of hours.

137
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:47,015
It's probably just a muscle ache.
Let us know if it gets worse.

138
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:54,176
So soreness and stuff,
that's not 'cause I'm sick?

139
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,191
Is something else bugging you?

140
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:00,754
Sort of.

141
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:06,193
- He has acute scrotum.
- Adorable.

142
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:08,324
Please, I thought you were dignified.

143
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,705
Come on, how am I not
supposed to make that joke?

144
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,295
The best thing about
big honkin' gonads...

145
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:15,979
well, one of the best things...

146
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,541
is there's only a few
infections that could cause it.

147
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:22,417
Do urinalysis and cultures for E.
Coli, Klebsiella, TB and brucella,

148
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:25,399
blood tests for enteroviruses
and adenoviruses.

149
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:29,096
Hopefully, the needles have grown
as fast as his sack, and we can find it.

150
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:30,797
Can Chase and Cameron cover that?

151
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:34,177
Mind if I ask why?

152
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,634
I want to recheck the National
Marrow Registry for an alternate donor.

153
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:41,896
- In case we're wrong?
- It's been known to happen.

154
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:44,881
Fine. Go.

155
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:52,948
Negative for E. Coli and TB.

156
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:56,056
Why is House taking it easy on Foreman?

157
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:57,294
He deserves a break.

158
00:10:57,295 --> 00:11:00,222
Yeah, House is all about
giving breaks to people in need.

159
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,317
No on Klebsiella.

160
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:05,515
And it's Tuesday.

161
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:09,935
It's got nothing to do with
Foreman or House. It's just...

162
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,819
it's the day I remind you I like you,
and I want us to be together.

163
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:17,072
Thank you. I'd forgotten.

164
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:23,078
No on brucella and
both viral antibodies.

165
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:25,873
You're really gonna
do this every Tuesday?

166
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:26,901
You take the day off,

167
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:28,984
I'll pick it up on Wednesday.

168
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:32,579
What if we're looking
for the wrong thing?

169
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,963
These are the only infections
that cause swollen testicles.

170
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:37,722
Why don't you just say it 4 times now
and leave me alone for a month?

171
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:38,988
What if it's not an infection?

172
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,770
His temperature's through the roof,
there's mucus pouring out of him.

173
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:42,867
I know he has an infection,

174
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,250
but what if it didn't directly
cause the scrotum issue?

175
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:46,201
What if it just...

176
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:49,163
caused the thing that
caused the scrotum issue?

177
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:51,784
CKMB is elevated.

178
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:55,694
Slightly. There's nothing wrong with...

179
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:57,086
Indicates cardiac injury.

180
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,303
We stuck him in that room,

181
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,030
put his stupid little runny
nose infection into hyper drive.

182
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:05,531
What if it went to his heart?

183
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,098
Pulmonary valve looks clean.

184
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:13,957
Wait. Stop.

185
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:16,271
Mitral valve. There's a growth.

186
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:21,195
He'll need a month of
antibiotics to clear that.

187
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,770
His brother only has four days to live.

188
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:32,542
The infection in Matty's mitral
valve rules him out as a donor.

189
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,451
- This is perfect.
- We drove the infection into his heart.

190
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:38,602
Okay. Perfect is too strong a word.
But it's very, very good.

191
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:41,207
Now we know where the infection is.

192
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:45,113
All we gotta do is remove the valve,
I.D. the infection, target and destroy.

193
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,689
Remove the valve?
He'll be fine on antibiotics.

194
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:49,232
He doesn't need open heart surgery.

195
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:52,094
He'll be heartbroken on
account of his dead brother.

196
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:56,096
Either way, he's got a dead brother.
The infection isn't just in the valve.

197
00:12:56,097 --> 00:12:59,541
Even with targeted medication, there's
no way we can clear his system in time.

198
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:02,046
We don't have to.
Enough to clear his marrow.

199
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,607
After the surgery,
you harvest the marrow,

200
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:07,694
marinate it in the targeted antibiotic,
simmer and serve.

201
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:11,093
- It could work.
- It's insane.

202
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:14,554
- It is better than a dead brother.
- I'm running this by Cuddy.

203
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:18,131
Fine. Go. In fact, let's all go.

204
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:24,362
This surgery is dangerous
and life-altering.

205
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,470
And clearly not in the
interest of our patient.

206
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:29,504
- It is if he likes his brother.
- We have a conflict of interests.

207
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:31,613
- The parents don't.
- Of course they do.

208
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:34,555
They already sacrificed Matty's
health to benefit his brother once.

209
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:36,217
They made his cold worse.

210
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,673
We screwed up his heart
valve by making his cold worse.

211
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:40,419
Do you have anything
to add to this debate?

212
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,920
Wilson's right, Foreman's wrong,

213
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,371
your shirt is way
too revealing for the office.

214
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,051
What do you want me to do?

215
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:51,802
We should call Child Services and
have them appoint a guardian for Matty.

216
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:53,076
No.

217
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:57,106
Go explain the choices to the parents.
And don't let House bully them.

218
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:03,654
Did you really think
I was gonna do that?

219
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:05,305
- I didn't.
- Then why did you let him...

220
00:14:05,306 --> 00:14:06,687
Tried to cut him some slack.

221
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:07,862
Nice of you.

222
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:10,512
I think he's got the yips.

223
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,200
Steve Blass, Scott Norwood, David Duval

224
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:16,007
all got the yips.

225
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:20,174
Great athletes. Lost their confidence,
and immediately started sucking.

226
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:23,046
And you're...
giving him time to work through it?

227
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,171
Four days and then he's fired.

228
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,419
You don't get better from the yips.

229
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:35,429
Open-heart surgery?

230
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:40,163
If you want both kids to live,
it's the only choice.

231
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,046
Due to the valve replacement,

232
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,215
Matty will have to be on blood
thinners to prevent potential clots.

233
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:46,616
- For how long?
- Forever.

234
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:50,456
He couldn't participate in contact
sport because of the risk of hemorrhage.

235
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:53,349
What about the Marrow Registry?
Maybe they'll find a match.

236
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,400
Maybe they'll ride it here on a unicorn.

237
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:58,599
I'm afraid finding a viable
new donor isn't something we can

238
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:00,395
realistically depend on.

239
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:07,582
Either we cripple one
son or kill the other.

240
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:09,496
He won't be able to play baseball.

241
00:15:10,836 --> 00:15:12,686
But that doesn't make him a cripple.

242
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,405
What should we do?

243
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:28,358
You should protect your family
as a whole. You should do the surgery.

244
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:34,070
- That was awesome!
- Shut up.

245
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:35,947
I gotta start pretending to care.

246
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:37,786
I did exactly what
Cuddy told us not to do.

247
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:40,166
No, you didn't. You did exactly
what she told me not to do.

248
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,767
You're completely in the clear.

249
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,392
You've gotta be kidding me.
You're actually upset.

250
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:46,683
You just said what you believed.

251
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,957
I also believe in patients
making their own choices.

252
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,164
Because it lessens your
guilt if things go wrong.

253
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:54,234
You're not protecting their choices.
You're soothing your conscience.

254
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:58,185
By that logic, a sociopath would make
the best patient advocate in the world.

255
00:15:58,955 --> 00:15:59,990
Am I blushing?

256
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,102
- You ready?
- Yeah.

257
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:13,228
Thanks.

258
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,174
You'd do the same for me.

259
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,701
Don't worry. You're gonna be fine.

260
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:30,695
Think I'll be better in
time to pitch in the playoffs?

261
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:32,188
Maybe next season.

262
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:39,255
We should have told him.

263
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:42,839
He loves his brother. But if he
understood what we were asking of him...

264
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,476
He loves his brother
more than he loves baseball.

265
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:46,872
You did the right thing.

266
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:50,119
Putting any part of
this decision on him...

267
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:52,784
it's impossible for
you guys to deal with this.

268
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:55,731
How's a ten-year-old supposed to do it?

269
00:17:11,884 --> 00:17:12,834
Canula in place.

270
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:17,176
Sutures are holding.

271
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,124
We're all set to go.

272
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,828
Switch him over to bypass.

273
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,490
- Yeah.
- I didn't do the surgery.

274
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:10,065
You woke me up to
tell me that you're lazy.

275
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,439
We biopsied a piece
before we started cutting.

276
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,890
I'm tired. Get to the point.

277
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:16,903
We didn't replace the valve
because the growth was fibrous tissue.

278
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:18,004
It wasn't infectious.

279
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,349
- We gotta be wrong about...
- Oh, God.

280
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,265
What? You know what's wrong with Matty?

281
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:23,276
I think Hector's...

282
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:25,050
committed suicide.

283
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:27,546
- What are you talking about?
- He took some pills.

284
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:30,335
- Is he alive?
- He ate half my stash.

285
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:32,628
Of course he's...

286
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:41,270
He's stoned.

287
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:43,602
I'll be right in.

288
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:51,334
We cut all the way
into this kid's heart,

289
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:54,687
and all we got was this lousy,
noninfectious fibrous tissue.

290
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:56,289
How did we miss this?

291
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:57,658
Matty had a fever.

292
00:18:57,815 --> 00:18:59,873
He got sicker when we
suppressed his immune system.

293
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:01,190
That all points to infection.

294
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:02,141
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

295
00:19:02,627 --> 00:19:03,577
Not our fault.

296
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:04,927
Fibrous tissue.

297
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:08,789
Something is turning his
healthy heart valve to gristle.

298
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:11,836
Fibrous tissue,
enlarged spleen... fever...

299
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:13,721
could mean autoimmune.

300
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,608
Autoimmune diseases aren't passed along
in bone marrow. He can still donate.

301
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:23,209
- We confirm, I do the surgery.
- Lupus and Bechet's are our best bet.

302
00:19:23,381 --> 00:19:26,481
- Do an ANA and a pathergy test.
- Or it could be infection.

303
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:28,902
My memory's not what it used to be,

304
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:31,353
but didn't we just rule
that out 8 seconds ago?

305
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:33,267
Just because it's not
what screwed up his valve

306
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:35,043
doesn't mean it's not in his system.

307
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,090
It has the obvious advantage
of making us right all along.

308
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:40,651
A little disadvantage
of making big brother dead.

309
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:42,533
That's your argument? Better outcome?

310
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:43,484
It fits.

311
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:46,661
The family has one kid with
leukemia and one with autoimmune.

312
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,529
Wouldn't stand next
to them in a rainstorm.

313
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,367
That's your argument...
it sucks for them?

314
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:52,618
It fits, and we can
still help big brother.

315
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:55,376
National Marrow Registry came
up with a four out of six donor...

316
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:57,887
Six out of six is two better
than four out of six, right?

317
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,488
I mean, I know two is so small,

318
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:02,297
but since it means that he's
gonna get graft versus host disease,

319
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:05,498
the marrow will attack his
body and he'll die a painful death.

320
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:08,947
Find out what autoimmune it is.

321
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:19,457
Is this autoimmune better
or worse than a new heart valve?

322
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,327
It depends on which autoimmune it is.

323
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:23,163
With early detection,
most are manageable.

324
00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:24,614
How long will the testing take?

325
00:20:24,615 --> 00:20:26,155
That's the other good thing about this.

326
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:28,191
There's literally thousands
of possible infections

327
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:30,243
but only a handful
of autoimmune conditions.

328
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:31,997
We'll have the answer in a few hours.

329
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:32,948
Hey, Doctor?

330
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:37,475
Is this bad?

331
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:47,632
Wanna catch a movie?

332
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,682
- It's 1:00 in the morning.
- I know a place.

333
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,911
Although I wouldn't recommend
wearing those shoes.

334
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:57,298
How, exactly,
does a dog unscrew a bottle of pills?

335
00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:58,882
Is that a riddle?

336
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:01,916
- It requires an opposable thumb.
- I must have left it off.

337
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:02,867
On the floor?

338
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:04,722
I think he hopped up
on the bathroom counter.

339
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:05,673
He has arthritis.

340
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,649
- Not me this time.
- No, it's your damn dog!

341
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,378
He chews everything!

342
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:18,311
I was missing a file.
Found paper in his stool.

343
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:21,523
An original Sun Record
78 Elvis recording... gone.

344
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:23,932
Who the hell chews vinyl?
He's vindictive.

345
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,155
And he's had a good, long life.
It's his time.

346
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,899
Are you okay?

347
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,957
I just tripped over
Wilson's self-righteousness.

348
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:34,929
What do you got?

349
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,460
Matty's negative for everything.
It's not autoimmune.

350
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:39,861
So we're back to infection.

351
00:21:39,943 --> 00:21:43,247
Nick's starting to deteriorate fast.
He's got bruising all over his arms.

352
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:46,278
Capillaries are leaking blood.
If it happens in his brain, he's dead.

353
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,729
We've got to go with
the four out of six donor.

354
00:21:48,993 --> 00:21:51,943
Did I mention my concerns
about four being less than six?

355
00:21:52,818 --> 00:21:55,118
Wilson's first wife
ignored a similar issue.

356
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:57,782
Of course, that time,
it was only fatal to their marriage.

357
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,785
It's either that or we start
randomly testing Matty for infections.

358
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,786
- I know you hate the word random.
- Do it alphabetically.

359
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:05,952
We're not doing that damn transplant.

360
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,376
Where's Foreman?

361
00:22:08,545 --> 00:22:11,125
We found a donor.
It's not an ideal match.

362
00:22:11,757 --> 00:22:14,157
But four out of six
still gives Nick a chance.

363
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:24,007
A partial match transplant
is extremely dangerous.

364
00:22:24,074 --> 00:22:25,215
Dr. Foreman explained.

365
00:22:25,216 --> 00:22:29,258
He also explain what sort of
pain your son will experience if he gets

366
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,522
graft versus host disease?
- Yes.

367
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:35,128
Apparently, he didn't explain it
vividly enough. Let me give it a whack.

368
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:37,391
He also explained
that if we did nothing,

369
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:39,954
Nick could start
bleeding into his brain.

370
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:44,145
Matty is a perfect match. Just give
us a little more time to figure out...

371
00:22:44,207 --> 00:22:47,205
- How much time?
- Dr. House is the best diagnostician...

372
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,676
How much time?

373
00:22:50,774 --> 00:22:51,724
I don't know.

374
00:22:51,952 --> 00:22:56,417
And Nick can start bleeding
into this brain without any warning.

375
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,363
Yes, but the chances of
complications from a mismatch...

376
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:00,864
My boys have suffered enough.

377
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:02,743
Get Matty better.

378
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:07,242
And give Nick the transplant
from the new donor.

379
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,825
- Foreman screwed us.
- No! You screwed us.

380
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:20,881
What is the point in
being able to control people

381
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:22,425
if you won't actually do it?

382
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,764
It's like training a dog
and then letting him go on your rug.

383
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:26,732
Which, by the way...

384
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:29,015
Once Foreman got his mitts on them,
there was no way...

385
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:31,949
You don't explain chances
and probabilities. You lie to them.

386
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:35,544
You tell them Foreman's a moron... which
isn't even much of a lie right now.

387
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:38,050
- You got to talk to him.
- I got no problem with what he did.

388
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:40,266
He undercut us and he may
have cost that kid his life!

389
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:43,879
He did what he thought was right.
You, on the other hand, sucked out.

390
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:45,310
When the decision really mattered,

391
00:23:45,311 --> 00:23:47,344
you didn't have the guts
to tell them what to do.

392
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:51,295
If that kid dies, it's because Foreman
was wrong and because you're a coward.

393
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:27,642
Oh, goodness! I've left my door open.

394
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:32,585
My poor dog must have run
away and been hit by a car or truck.

395
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:34,657
Or train.

396
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:36,610
Or an anvil.

397
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:49,381
Thank God... you're still here.

398
00:24:50,814 --> 00:24:51,797
He's still here!

399
00:24:56,532 --> 00:24:57,494
Where's my stereo?

400
00:25:25,312 --> 00:25:26,262
How you feeling?

401
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:28,053
A little itchy.

402
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:31,363
It's weird, huh?

403
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:36,415
You still have no idea what's wrong with
me, but those meds will make me better.

404
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:40,903
We put you on a variety of medications
that'll fight all kinds of infections.

405
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:45,312
But Nick...
you know exactly what's wrong with him,

406
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:48,319
but maybe he's gonna die anyway.

407
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:52,049
- Hopefully, the new marrow will...
- I can't go in there, can I?

408
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:58,276
Your infection would kill him.

409
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,967
So I won't be able to be with him...

410
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:04,239
when he dies?

411
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,530
You'll be able to be
with him when he gets better.

412
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:14,944
- What's wrong?
- It really itches.

413
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:25,255
Hello?

414
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:39,091
Why am I meeting you here?

415
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:41,326
You're paying for my new cane.

416
00:26:41,898 --> 00:26:42,848
It was your dog.

417
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:46,198
So that's it.
You call me a coward, life goes on...

418
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:48,118
Apparently. You showed up.

419
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:56,225
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:00,738
Okay.

421
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,531
You're pathetic.
I didn't actually mean that.

422
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:09,043
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

423
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,644
- To infinity.
- Yes, you did.

424
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,131
- You're pathetic.
- Yeah.

425
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:15,288
When?

426
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,700
What did the lab say?

427
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:28,325
Why don't you buy your cane in a medical
supply store like a normal cripple?

428
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:29,637
Fewer bitchin' choices.

429
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:31,627
Okay.

430
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:34,806
- What do you got in bitchin'?
- Right this way.

431
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:36,697
That was Cameron.

432
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,548
The kid that wasn't all
that sick is now all that sick.

433
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,181
He's bleeding out of his ears.

434
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:42,432
- Blood counts?
- Down.

435
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:47,111
- Schistocytes on the smear?
- His body's not making new blood cells.

436
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:48,811
His bone marrow's crashing.

437
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:50,473
This is one of our top sellers.

438
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:54,341
It's a little too Marilyn
Manson in a retirement home.

439
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,890
- Meds are suppressing his bone marrow.
- Or the infection's doing it.

440
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:01,462
Very cool.

441
00:28:01,568 --> 00:28:04,282
Genuine bull penis
stretched over a metal rod.

442
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:08,772
Penis canes are murder.

443
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:13,819
- Let me see the one on the end.
- You got it.

444
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:17,658
You need to stop Matty's meds.
The marrow rebounds, it's the meds.

445
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:20,716
- If it doesn't, it's an infection.
- And if it's the infection?

446
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:23,117
Maybe I was wrong about
which kid's gonna die.

447
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:30,866
Bitchin'.

448
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,710
Flames.

449
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,320
Makes it look like I'm going fast.

450
00:28:55,955 --> 00:28:57,255
Now, how's our dying kid?

451
00:28:57,256 --> 00:28:59,421
Nick's developed blisters
all over his feet and legs.

452
00:28:59,422 --> 00:29:01,372
He's got grade four graft versus host.

453
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,409
Increase his dosage
of methylprednisolone.

454
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,960
Already did. It's not working.

455
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:07,356
Feeling guilty?

456
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,411
- I did the right thing.
- Always a comfort.

457
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:16,093
- Okay, what's the other kid's status?
- We're done with Nick?

458
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,649
God is done with Nick.
We know what he has.

459
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,830
We know how to treat it.
We're doing it. It's not working.

460
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:23,179
Life is for the living.

461
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,926
Matty's been off his
meds for a few hours,

462
00:29:24,927 --> 00:29:26,554
but his blood count's still tanking.

463
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:28,894
It means the meds aren't to blame.
It's the infection.

464
00:29:28,895 --> 00:29:32,845
If we don't get this under control, his
blood will literally turn into water.

465
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:39,101
Cultures still aren't growing anything.

466
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:39,926
Why not?

467
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:43,690
Because you did the right thing.
Convinced the parents to treat the kid.

468
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,679
All you did was yank
the weed out of the ground.

469
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,230
It's roots are still
killing your beautiful lawn.

470
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:51,880
We just can't see it. And if we
can't, we don't know what it is.

471
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:54,481
And if we don't know what it is,
we can't kill it.

472
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:58,266
You gotta wait for
it to grow back again.

473
00:29:59,184 --> 00:30:00,973
Now his soil is arid.

474
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:04,942
So he and his brother
will be dead by the time...

475
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:15,357
What if the dandelion
was in fertile soil?

476
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:19,621
What if we take the roots
from Matty and put them in Nick?

477
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:21,922
Turn the kid into a petri dish.
Only better.

478
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:23,945
A petri dish can't
tell you when it hurts.

479
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:26,256
You want to give him
his brother's infection?

480
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,965
The very thing we've been trying
to avoid since the brother sneezed?

481
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:31,667
- Leukemia kid's got no defenses.
- Which is why he'll die.

482
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:34,368
But before he does,
the infection will spread, fast.

483
00:30:34,808 --> 00:30:38,058
Fast enough to tell us what it is.
In time to save his brother.

484
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:45,338
Do you see any other way?

485
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:51,348
The infection is decimating
Matty's bone marrow.

486
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,320
But...

487
00:30:53,474 --> 00:30:55,301
if we give that marrow to Nick,

488
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,793
his symptoms could
let us diagnose Matty.

489
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:01,146
- But it'll kill Nick.
- Yes.

490
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:03,248
You're...

491
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:06,451
you're saying we should
kill one son to save the other?

492
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:08,670
- Nick is gonna die either way.
- You don't know that!

493
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:10,164
I mean, he's in pain right now, but...

494
00:31:10,165 --> 00:31:13,016
Nick's graft versus host
is not responding to medication.

495
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,257
It can change.

496
00:31:15,615 --> 00:31:17,929
May... maybe he'll... he'll rally.

497
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:21,158
My Nick is a fighter.

498
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:23,876
Graft versus host is not
gonna go away because of Nick's

499
00:31:23,877 --> 00:31:25,600
sunny smile and positive outlook.

500
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:29,347
Nick has survived three
reoccurrences of his leukemia.

501
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:31,647
He's being torn apart
from the inside out.

502
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:34,419
His pain's gonna get
worse and worse until he dies.

503
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,783
You're just dragging it out.

504
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:40,068
You have only one decision to make...

505
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,649
to leave here with one dead son or two.

506
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:51,416
Tell them.

507
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:57,374
You should let us do this.

508
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,050
No.

509
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,409
We're not giving up on Nick.

510
00:32:17,506 --> 00:32:18,456
Not!

511
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,359
Patients' parents apparently
don't want to be parents anymore.

512
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:39,214
You're a sneaky bastard.
Any ideas how we get around this?

513
00:32:39,911 --> 00:32:41,613
- Court order?
- That's hardly sneaky.

514
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:43,902
We can still save Matty. Run more tests.

515
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:46,101
Find out what infection
is destroying his marrow.

516
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:49,120
10,000 possible infections.
At least 20 minutes per test.

517
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:51,099
Take you approximately eight years.

518
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:54,713
Actually, four months, assuming
the last one I test is the right one.

519
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:57,618
If it's the first,
it'll take me approximately 20 minutes.

520
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:59,077
He's right. It's worth a shot.

521
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:02,854
He's timid. Testing blindly
is not gonna save this kid.

522
00:33:03,002 --> 00:33:04,552
But standing around here will.

523
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:37,691
Wow, he sure is hurting.

524
00:33:38,005 --> 00:33:40,189
Nurses say he maxed
out on his pain meds.

525
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,820
If I had a nickel for
every time I heard that...

526
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:49,703
Pharmacy's on the ground floor.

527
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:53,622
I'm gonna go get you some
more pain medication, okay?

528
00:33:53,623 --> 00:33:54,573
Thank you.

529
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,410
It's not gonna help.

530
00:34:15,608 --> 00:34:16,558
You're dying.

531
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,739
Nothing's gonna change that.

532
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:20,773
Drugs'll just make you go easier.

533
00:34:21,855 --> 00:34:22,805
I know.

534
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:25,876
14 years on the planet.

535
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,330
Most of them spent suffering.

536
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,701
Dying before you even got to...

537
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:33,899
drive a car,

538
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,053
take off a girl's bra,

539
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:37,906
drink a beer.

540
00:34:39,676 --> 00:34:41,976
Believe me,
there's plenty you haven't done.

541
00:34:43,028 --> 00:34:43,978
Really good stuff.

542
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:49,651
Must make it hard to believe in...

543
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:51,398
God or...

544
00:34:52,364 --> 00:34:53,314
fairness,

545
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:54,794
a larger purpose.

546
00:34:58,885 --> 00:35:01,235
But your life doesn't
have to be meaningless.

547
00:35:02,126 --> 00:35:03,635
You can save your brother.

548
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:08,821
How?

549
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,715
- Negative for CMV.
- Negative for amoebas.

550
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:18,725
- House called you timid.
- He's called me a lot worse.

551
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:20,733
To him, there is nothing worse.

552
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,390
He's gonna fire you.

553
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:24,111
Even if we run a hundred tests,

554
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,739
that only gives us a 1%
chance of saving these kids.

555
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,972
Better than zero.
You don't care if you get fired?

556
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:29,852
I don't know,

557
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:33,019
there's got to be a way to better
our odds from 99% chance of death.

558
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,016
You gotta know.

559
00:35:34,017 --> 00:35:36,550
It's not food-borne, because
no one else in the family is sick.

560
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,343
Either you care about
your job or you don't.

561
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,056
Matty's the only one who drank
from that water pump in the backyard,

562
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:42,835
but we eliminated
Pseudomonas and cholera.

563
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:45,408
If you care, you fight to keep it.
If you don't, you quit.

564
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:48,972
I thought they lived in the suburbs.

565
00:35:49,935 --> 00:35:51,253
They do. Why?

566
00:35:51,431 --> 00:35:52,731
They've got a water pump?

567
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,629
- Please, I wanna do it.
- No, Nicky.

568
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,364
It's not your decision.

569
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:05,315
I'm dying.

570
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:08,248
There's nothing that's
gonna change that.

571
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:11,065
Don't say that, okay?

572
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:12,978
You can't give up.

573
00:36:14,023 --> 00:36:15,473
It's time for me to go, Dad.

574
00:36:17,752 --> 00:36:18,802
You gotta let me go.

575
00:36:22,573 --> 00:36:23,523
No.

576
00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:27,965
Please, son.

577
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:31,332
I can't!

578
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:38,234
Let me do it for Matty.

579
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,783
Let me do it for you guys...

580
00:36:43,728 --> 00:36:44,878
so you won't be alone.

581
00:36:55,678 --> 00:36:58,522
- Are you sure?
- No. But he is.

582
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:06,281
- Get Nick back to the clean room.
- The parents agreed to infect him.

583
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:09,718
We figured out what's wrong
with Matty... histoplasmosis.

584
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,177
Well, what is that?
I mean, why did it...

585
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:14,195
Fungal infection.
Grows in chicken feces.

586
00:37:14,196 --> 00:37:16,363
The dirt that Matty used
to build his pitcher's mound

587
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:18,059
must have sat under a chicken coop.

588
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,810
Your whole neighborhood
was built on top of farmland.

589
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:22,552
We didn't test for
it earlier because we...

590
00:37:22,553 --> 00:37:23,503
Can you fix him?

591
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:27,657
Full course of amphotericin,
and he should be fine.

592
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:32,882
And Nick? I mean,
can you clean Matty's marrow,

593
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:36,400
just like you were talking
about doing it, but do it fast and...

594
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:37,501
and get it into Nick?

595
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:40,573
I'm sorry.

596
00:37:40,689 --> 00:37:44,589
The reason Matty is so sick is because
the infection's attacking his marrow.

597
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:49,218
He doesn't have enough left to safely
take from him and give to his brother.

598
00:37:57,184 --> 00:37:58,634
I'm going to get better now?

599
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:00,419
That's it?

600
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:01,882
That's it.

601
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:03,509
And what about Nick?

602
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:13,217
Your brother was willing
to risk his life to save you.

603
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,009
Are you willing to do that for him?

604
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:20,826
I can't sedate you. You're too sick.

605
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:02,121
Please, please stop.

606
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,092
Please, please. You're done, right?

607
00:39:05,894 --> 00:39:07,802
Sorry. I need a lot more.

608
00:39:09,553 --> 00:39:11,482
No. Stop! Stop!

609
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,527
How much heat are you
taking from the parents?

610
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,861
They're calming down.
I think it has something to do with

611
00:39:26,862 --> 00:39:29,176
both their kids being alive,
awake, and eating.

612
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:31,538
The marrow transplant took.

613
00:39:33,647 --> 00:39:34,797
Welcome back, Foreman.

614
00:39:34,974 --> 00:39:37,256
- You should talk to him.
- And tell him how proud I am?

615
00:39:37,257 --> 00:39:39,576
Hey, if you're ashamed of him,
you can tell him that.

616
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:43,538
Pride and shame only apply to people we
have a vested interest in,

617
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,867
not employees.

618
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,572
How many hours a day do
you have to spend with someone

619
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:49,973
before they're basically family?
- Good point.

620
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:53,587
But first, I gotta tell Cameron and
Chase that they're violating God's will.

621
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:57,329
I'm just asking you to have
an adult conversation to let him know...

622
00:39:57,492 --> 00:39:59,522
That he did a good job? He knows it.

623
00:40:00,546 --> 00:40:02,705
Adults don't need adult conversations.

624
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:05,029
Just like I don't
need this conversation.

625
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:07,209
Have you killed Hector yet?

626
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:08,538
Obviously not.

627
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:12,422
He's quiet. He's...

628
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:15,702
Is that my stethoscope?

629
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:18,633
Bad dog!

630
00:40:22,013 --> 00:40:22,963
Listen...

631
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:27,328
Bonnie joined her homeowners
association and staged a coup.

632
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:29,677
Pets are now allowed.

633
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:36,582
If you want to keep him, she wants
a new puppy anyway. She'll understand.

634
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:38,632
Why would I want to keep him?

635
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:40,185
You're sure.

636
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,970
Come on, boy.

637
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,121
Accidents happen.

638
00:41:01,284 --> 00:41:02,234
Candy?

639
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,469
Good boy.

640
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,180
Good boy.

641
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:51,631
You did good.

642
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:55,578
I did what you would have.

643
00:41:57,838 --> 00:41:58,788
Well...

644
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:00,336
maybe I'm biased, but...

645
00:42:00,346 --> 00:42:03,146
- I tortured the kid.
- Because you knew it was right.

646
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:06,361
You knew you were saving his brother.

647
00:42:07,537 --> 00:42:08,487
I know.

648
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:11,247
I don't like that I know.

649
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,008
I hate that I can listen
to a kid screaming in pain

650
00:42:16,137 --> 00:42:19,887
and not even take a moment to question
whether I'm doing the right thing.

651
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:23,435
I hate that in order
to be like you as a doctor,

652
00:42:24,268 --> 00:42:26,268
I have to be like you as a human being.

653
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,095
I don't want to turn into you.

654
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,040
You're not.

655
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,430
You've been like me since
you were eight years old.

656
00:42:44,465 --> 00:42:46,315
You'll save more people than I will.

657
00:42:48,406 --> 00:42:50,144
But I'll settle for killing less.

658
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:53,978
Consider this my two weeks' notice.
