00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Host: www.CsSubs.org - Thanks Guys

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,010
You okay?

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,340
Yeah, I just got clipped with a beam.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,970
What the hell do you two think you were doing?

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,340
We thought we heard someone in there.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,120
You never go in without authorization.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,180
Captain, this is all me.Amy just followed me in.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,150
So torching your ass last year wasn't enough, huh?

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,750
You need to stop trying to prove how 
tough you are before you get yourself killed.

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,200
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,820
Go have the paramedics look you over.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,000
Come on, derek, let's get this 
ladder to the second story.

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,430
Let's go.

16
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,310
Derek!

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,240
Derek!

18
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,700
Derek!

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,350
What's happening?

20
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,920
I'M...freezing.

21
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,310
I'm fine.

22
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,860
Er docs don't think so.

23
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,320
Your temperature's been going up 
and down like a roller coaster.

24
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,580
How old are these skin grafts?

25
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,220
Last one was about six months ago.

26
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,880
Gonna run some tests,and we'll get 
a consult with dr. House.

27
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,180
I'll be fine. 

28
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,800
You'll be doing what the doctors say.
Got it?

29
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,500
I'll check in later.

30
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,020
Hey.

31
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,280
The way you covered for me last night.

32
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,590
He's my brother.

33
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,880
I know how to eat it from him.

34
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,670
I'm gonna stop after my shift, okay?

35
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,650
Yeah.

36
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,100
Okay.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,050
So where is this dr. House?

38
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,300
Speaking engagement.

39
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,850
Not guilty.

40
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,170
And on the charge of gaining control of 

41
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,070
said medication by fraud, how do you plead?

42
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,900
Not guilty.

43
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,850
Very well.

44
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,710
Preliminary hearing is set for 
the 19th at 10:00 am,

45
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,680
at which time I'll determine whether 

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,810
there's enough evidence to proceed to trial.

47
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,860
Next case on the calendar,people V. Williams
charged assault for second degree 

48
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,230
You're gonna go talk to him?

49
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,130
I was just gonna ask him where he gets his hair cut.

50
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,040
They have your signature in a prescription log,

51
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
a security camera video,

52
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,260
and a pharmacist's sworn statement saying 

53
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,130
you stole the dead guy's pills.

54
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,060
You're already looking at ten years.

55
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,290
You want to add witness intimidating charge?

56
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,740
Go ahead.

57
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,480
Ask him about his hair.

58
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,050
He suffered third degree burns over 
54% of his body a year ago 

59
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,770
and arrived in the er last night 
disoriented and shivering.

60
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,330
For 12 hours his temperature was
bouncing between 96 and 102.

61
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,440
Why don't you contest the search 
of the pharmacy records?

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,400
Yeah, you could argue it violated 
doctor-patient confidentiality.

63
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,060
Except he wasn't the patient or the doctor.

64
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,840
He was the guy who stole from 
the patient and the doctor.

65
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,010
This was the third time he had been 
disoriented in the last two weeks.

66
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,080
Running into smoke-filled burning buildings 
can be a bit disorienting.

67
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,140
Fortunately, I have the cure.

68
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,200
Stop doing it.

69
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,410
He's not in a burning building anymore,
and he's still shivering.

70
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,020
A hypothalamic tumor could cause 
a vacillating temperature.

71
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,160
So could er nurses who are too busy to notice

72
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,210
that a patient likes both hot coffee and cold sodas.

73
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,250
He tested negative for hep c,tb, hiv, 
lyme,and his tox screen's clean.

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,320
In case you hadn't noticed,
not exactly in the mood to dance.

75
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,960
I'm not asking you to dance.
I asking you to do your job.

76
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,050
Ekg showed arrhythmia.

77
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,110
Probably just a mild heart attack.

78
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,400
No chest pain.

79
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,900
And smoke inhalation already 
explains the arrhythmia.

80
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,930
The guy was in the burn unit for six months 
and had multiple surgeries.

81
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,580
Could be a hospital-acquired infection.
Maybe mrsa

82
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,000
Works for me.

83
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,860
Draw blood cultures.Start him on antibiotics.

84
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,540
Vancomycin plus broad gram negative coverage.

85
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,130
If you called to see the design 
for my prison tats,they're still in r&D.

86
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,580
You need to talk to tritter.

87
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,330
Not according to my lawyer.

88
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,390
Your lawyer isn't gonna be able to get the da 
to the drop the case.Tritter caN.

89
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,460
Yeah, you know what else tritter can do?

90
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,480
You are not impressing anyone.

91
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,510
You may call yourself principled,

92
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,460
but what you really are is stubborn,adolescent idiot.

93
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,790
- This isn't his fault. 
- I'm not the one--

94
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,070
you used the rectal thermometer on him.

95
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,870
You insulted him instead of apologizing.

96
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,730
You flaunted your drug use in his face.

97
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,860
And you refused to accept a deal--

98
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,190
I accepted the deaL.

99
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,160
Not until after you stole a dead guy's pills.

100
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,660
Allegedly.

101
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,730
Tritter has been opening doors 
for you every step of the way, 

102
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,740
and you keep slamming them shut.

103
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,430
There are no more openings to give, house.

104
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,700
If you want to stay out of prison,
you gotta make one for yourself.

105
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,370
It's vicodin.

106
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,190
You function better on it.

107
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,750
Talk to him.

108
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,480
Mrsa's a bacteria that often 
infects hospital patients.

109
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,340
The burns on your chest and arm exposed 
raw flesh that made youa wide open target.

110
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,810
But the antibiotics will take care of it, right?

111
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,580
Depends on what strainit is.

112
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,590
We'll know more once weget the results 
back from these cultures.

113
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,740
So this...

114
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,310
mrsa thing...

115
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,760
would it make everything look blue?

116
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,190
He's seeing blue.

117
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,770
Who'd you get the scrip from?

118
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,370
Cuddy.

119
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,260
You want to know what I gave her?

120
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,250
Mrsa wouldn't change his ocular palette.

121
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,380
Heavy metal poisoning could cause 
vision changes,particularly thallium.

122
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,240
If it was thallium,he'd be losing his hair.

123
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,960
So maybe it's menopause.

124
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,970
He's 28 years old.

125
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,070
Yes, his age is the reason it's weird 
that a man has menopause.

126
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,320
Male menopause.

127
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,290
High estrogen,low testosterone.

128
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,830
Explains the temperature swings,disorientation.

129
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,670
Endocrinologically similar to female menopause

130
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,840
but without the vaginas and mah-jongg tiles.

131
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,070
Male menopause doesn't explain the blue vision.

132
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,550
The blue vision isn't a symptom, 
it's a side effect of viagra.

133
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,040
It's right there on the label.

134
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,620
Which I have no reason to have read 
except that I'm a doctor.

135
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,710
He's not taking viagra.

136
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,540
You mean he didn't tell you he was taking viagra.

137
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,370
I don't care how sick he is, trust me.

138
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,820
He still thinks he's got a shot.

139
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,300
Menopause causes temperature swings, limpness.

140
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,720
Limpness causes pills,pills cause the blues.

141
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,060
He's presenting no other signs of premature aging.

142
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,230
Aging's not the only cause.

143
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,100
You said that's he got burns on 54% of his body.

144
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,550
Sure it's not 55%?

145
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,420
Burns to his genitals could cause testicular trauma.

146
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,300
Which in turn could cause?

147
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,930
Run a hormone panel.

148
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,970
Comes back positive,pump him full 
of testosterone and send him home.

149
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,880
And stop following me.

150
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,130
Thank god my parents are dead.

151
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,380
If the old man had heard I had menopause
I'd never live it down.

152
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,950
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

153
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,360
Once these testosterone pellets dissolve
your system will be back to normal.

154
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,350
Yeah, but till then I'm an old lady.

155
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,120
Okay to come in?

156
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,070
It's not mrsa.

157
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,740
He's not being isolated anymore.

158
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,830
Anyone not in a white coat is welcome.

159
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,250
You're looking better.
How you feeling?

160
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,690
I'm good.

161
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,860
Turns out I got some hormone thing.

162
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,930
They're fixing it right now.

163
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,700
You okay?

164
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,890
Yeah, I think so.I just--uhh!

165
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,030
Derek, you in pain?

166
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,310
You need to get these out.

167
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,630
- Hold on.What's wrong? 
- Get these out.

168
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,430
- What's going on? 
- Looks like an allergic reaction.

169
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,380
Derek, hold on, 
we're gonna get you something to stop it.

170
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,860
- No, just take 'em out! 
- You gotta calm down.

171
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,780
Get 'em out!Derek!

172
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,940
Derek, let her go!

173
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,340
Derek, let her go!

174
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,730
I need two milligrams iv lorazepam stat!

175
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,410
Get 'em out!

176
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,730
Complaint department's across the hall.

177
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,540
I'm busy.

178
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,750
Can I just assume that you told me 
how unfair I'm being and--

179
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,580
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,690
You could throw a dart at all 
the adjectives between arrogant 

181
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,690
and unhinged and I'm sure 
you'd hit one that describes me.

182
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,890
There's a reason I operate that way.

183
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,660
I live in pain.

184
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,940
Pain that on good days is merely intolerable,

185
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,900
but on bad ones will suck 
the life force right out of you.

186
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,150
Doesn't mean that I've handled this right.

187
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,340
Actually...means I was wrong.

188
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,600
Thank you.

189
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,050
I know that couldn't have been...

190
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,730
easy for you to say.

191
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,700
Even if you don't mean a word of it.

192
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,220
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,120
You can hook me up to a damn polygraph.

194
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,800
And I'm sure you'd pass.

195
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,920
The thing is, I've never been interested 
in what you have to say.

196
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,990
All I care about is what you do.

197
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,010
I'll see you at the hearing.

198
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,150
it wasn't the medicine.

199
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,950
Contamination and allergy tests 
both came back negative.

200
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,440
There was nothing to suggest a pulmonary embolism.

201
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,670
And his ekg showed the expected tachycardia 
from the exertion of the attack.

202
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,560
And I'm fine by the way,thanks for asking.

203
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,040
aggression comes on that fast
it's gotta have a neurologic basis.

204
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,980
We should do a ctfor a frontal lobe tumor 
and an lp for meningitis.

205
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,080
Great.

206
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,870
Have at it.

207
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,490
That's it?

208
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,640
No challenging our theory?
No tearing us down?

209
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,120
No need.

210
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,960
You've got it under control.

211
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,950
Where are you going?

212
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,730
Upstairs this time.

213
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,020
To do what?

214
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,640
Check myself into rehab.

215
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,310
did tritter offer you another deal?

216
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,880
Nope.This is all me.

217
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,250
So, no slaps on the back,encouraging words?

218
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,400
We're just trying to understand what this is.

219
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,300
I hope it's me detoxing.

220
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,690
Otherwise I soiled a perfectly good pair 
of underwear last night for nothing.

221
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,340
So this is for real?

222
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,870
It's not just a show for tritter?

223
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,760
Absolutely it's a show for tritter.

224
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,240
And the judge.

225
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,670
Unfortunately,unless it's real,
there is no show.

226
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,580
Hey, if it doesn't help my case,then at least 

227
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,520
I can go to prison with heightened senses.

228
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,700
All the better to enjoy my strolls around the yard.

229
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,760
Time's up.Group's starting.

230
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,150
Gonna need to check that stuff.

231
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,590
When I lead the big patient rebellion,
voldemort here is first to go.

232
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,330
Ct was normal.No frontal lobe tumor.

233
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,300
Lp was negativefor meningitis.
We're back to square one.

234
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,400
What about something vascular?

235
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,960
Polyarterit is nodosa?

236
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,110
Brain lesions would've shown up on the ct 

237
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,770
legionnaire's explains the chills and temperature.

238
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,560
Altered mental status causes the aggression.

239
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,510
We would've seen respiratory problems.

240
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,660
We're throwing darts.

241
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,210
We need to go to house.

242
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,800
We need to deal with this ourselves.

243
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,320
He can make the time.
Derek's still his patient.

244
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,570
The man's life as he knows it could be over.

245
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,300
I think you of all people would 
want to cut him some slack.

246
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,930
We're treating a man who runs into 
burning buildings for perfect strangers.

247
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,780
He didn't ask for what's happening to him.

248
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,270
House did everything to himself.

249
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,710
He's been cut more than enough slack.

250
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,890
Right now, house has more important 
things to deal with.

251
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,950
It was the first time I'd seen him in months.

252
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,760
I guess I was hoping he'd put his arms 
around me and tell me he understood.

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,990
But he said he wasn't ready to forgive me.

254
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,730
he may never be ready.

255
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,630
You're doing the only thing you can do.

256
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,030
You're trying.

257
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,700
How about you, greg?

258
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,900
You thought about how to fix things 
with people in your life?

259
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,450
No need.

260
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,730
People in my life have no expectations of me.

261
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,820
Makes all our lives easier.

262
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,290
Apparently not.

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,160
- The first step in recovery--
- is admitting I have a problem.

264
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,110
I've obviously done that,or I wouldn't be here.

265
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,620
I've even embraced step two.

266
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,770
I've accepted that there is a higher power.

267
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,930
Maybe not a god perse,
but that andre the giant guyw as powerful.

268
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,310
Where I start to butt up 
against it is step three

269
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,200
surrendering my will to this higher power.

270
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,070
I'm sure andre's ghost has my back 
and all,but my free will?

271
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,370
I never leave home without it.

272
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,950
Kind of like your pills.

273
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,400
If you could do this on your own,
I assume you wouldn't be here.

274
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,340
True.

275
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,060
Everybody lies.

276
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,160
His tox screen.

277
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,330
It's been clean every time.

278
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,490
Exactly.

279
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,950
It shouldn't bE.He's had extensive skin grafts
which hurt like hell.

280
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,520
Not everybody's house.People can handle 
pain without medication.

281
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,870
But they do have pain.

282
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,870
This guy's worried about losing his job
so he's hiding the pain.

283
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,230
We find out where the pain is
maybe we find out where the problem is.

284
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,900
Or he doesn't feel pain.

285
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,630
Either way,it's something.

286
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,140
When?

287
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,020
Two minutes ago.Pulse is 137.
Respiration 42.

288
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,550
He was fine.He was just telling me a joke.

289
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,530
Get her out of here.

290
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,480
No fluid in his lungs.

291
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,420
O2 set's 85.He's hypoxic.
We're gonna have to intubate.

292
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,590
It's not his lungs.
He's got marked s-t elevation.

293
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,190
He's having a heart attack.

294
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,880
Pick a color.

295
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,860
Medication time.

296
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,500
You are a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day.

297
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,590
He's stable.

298
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,910
Won't stay that way.

299
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,550
His blood tests show troponins and ckmb up.

300
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,380
Chase was right.He was hiding chest pain.

301
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,360
He's been having a whole series of heart attacks.

302
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,390
Heart attacks can't cause you to 
reach out and choke someone.

303
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,630
Lack of oxygen to the brain causes disorientation.

304
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,290
Increased adrenaline causes rage.

305
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,280
More important question is,
what caused the attacks?

306
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,910
Where you going?

307
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,460
To see house.

308
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,130
We have a 28-year-old with clean arteries,

309
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,450
no valvular abnormalities having multiple attacks.

310
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,900
I'm not gonna wait for chase to 
give us another breakthrough.

311
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,370
Maybe we should go.

312
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,110
We don't have an answer yet.

313
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,400
I'm fine by the way,thanks for asking.

314
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,990
Whoever came up with buprenorphine to 
wean off vicodin should be shot.

315
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,810
Then stabbed in the eye.

316
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,090
Think someone needs to adjust my meds!

317
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,430
The heart shows no signs of inflammation or

318
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,460
the cause of the heart attacks isn't internal.

319
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,450
It must be external,something environmental.

320
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,430
None of the attacks happened in the same place.

321
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,460
Still must be something in common.

322
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,180
First one happenedin an apartment building fire.

323
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,950
Fire, water, smoke,oxygen masks.

324
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,500
And the second and third ones happened here.

325
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,940
There's no fire,no water, no smoke.

326
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,160
His clothes are all different.
He'd been cleaned.

327
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,690
That's the what'S.How about the who's?

328
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,020
His partner amy was at all three attacks, 
but--anyone else?

329
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,140
People don't cause heart attacks.

330
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,670
Well, you should be worried about proving me wrong.

331
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,500
amy?

332
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,900
Would you come with me, please?

333
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,430
Anything new on my brother?

334
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,490
We're not quite sure yet.
Could you come with me?

335
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,650
Yeah.

336
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,680
What's this all about?

337
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,480
I don't know.

338
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,570
They wanted to talk to us together.

339
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,000
Derek!

340
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,770
House was right.

341
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,300
I don't get it.

342
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,050
How can I be causing his heart attacks?

343
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,400
You may be carrying an agent that triggered them.

344
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,730
It could be anything.
Mold spores,poisonous plant residue,

345
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,440
something you picked up at a fire site.

346
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,190
Until we identy the agent,
we can't allow you near derek.

347
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,170
I can't believe that I'm doing this to him.

348
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,270
You can't blame yourself for this.

349
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,700
You know how he got those skin grafts?

350
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,250
He was trapped in a fire.

351
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,760
We were clearing rooms in an office building fire,

352
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,250
and the ceiling collapsed.

353
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,510
And it cut me off from the rest of the group.

354
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,480
And I kept yelling that I was fine,

355
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,140
but derek refused to wait for 
the team to clear the debris, 

356
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,310
so he took off looking for another access point.

357
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,060
He got caught in a back draft.

358
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,750
He almost died because of me once.

359
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,750
And now it's happening again.

360
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,060
You're not my mom.

361
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,380
You don't have to keep checking up on me.

362
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,200
How you doing?

363
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,910
Not bad.

364
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,220
Considering I've just learned 
I'm completely powerless 

365
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,370
see this big fancy wing?

366
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,060
It was built because this program works.

367
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,450
Faulty logic.

368
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:16,680
This big fancy wing exists because 
some people with money think that it works.

369
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,270
They want to believe they can buy a better world.

370
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,920
This is nothing short of idealized despair.

371
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,790
Let other people wallow in it.

372
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,470
I don't even know what that means.

373
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,600
None of this means anything.

374
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,670
It's just nonsensicals logans and platitudes.

375
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,290
Meaning takes time.It takes work.

376
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,250
What do you think I've been doing?

377
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,220
You've been here for two days.

378
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,490
Talk about wallowing in it.

379
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,650
We all get it.

380
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,510
We know how much pain you have.

381
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,860
You're here to deal with that 
and get on with your life.

382
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,040
Right.

383
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,090
I should have an affair with a dying patient 
and move into a hotel.

384
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,990
You're a coward, house.

385
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,800
You find fault in everybody,because 
you're afraid to look at yourself.

386
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,340
Thanks.

387
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,410
I was running short on platitudes.

388
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,080
You can leave now.

389
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,410
We tested amy for about a dozen different agents,

390
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,850
but they all came back negative.

391
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,450
So she's not causing the attacks.

392
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,310
Derek...are you in love with her?

393
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,850
What does that have to do with anything?

394
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,650
Amy told me how you got those skin grafts.

395
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,500
And the way you're always watching out for her.

396
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,400
And I see the way you look at her.

397
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,110
Have you told her how you feel?

398
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,820
She has a six-year-old daughter.

399
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,340
Women with daughters can still fall in love.

400
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,380
I know.

401
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,890
Because she did.With my brother.

402
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,350
They're engaged.

403
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,030
broken heart syndrome.

404
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,370
He's in love,and it's killing him.

405
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,180
Thought that only happened to 80-year-old widows.

406
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,410
Thanks to his menopause and estrogen level 
he basically is an old woman.

407
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,800
Bhs is an acute physical response 
to an emotional experience.

408
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,020
Stress triggers a flood of catecholamines

409
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,450
that's a plain old stress cardiomyopathy
not a heart attack.

410
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,060
But if you're too worried about losing your job

411
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,140
to get it treated,they can devolve 
into full-on heart attacks.

412
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,960
You think it's a coincidence this 
started when amy got engaged?

413
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,430
No, I don'T.

414
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:34,140
But now that you know the why
what are you gonna do to stop the how?

415
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,240
We already put him on beta blockers 
and nitroglycerine,no effect.

416
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,750
We need to put him on anti-depressants.

417
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,820
Not if you're right.

418
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,740
Anti-depressants would inhibit 
his autonomic nervous system

419
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,630
which would only speed up the heart attacks.

420
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,470
We could trypropyl thiouracil.

421
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,980
Slow down his metabolic rate.

422
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,050
Thyroid effect would only weaken the heart.

423
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,620
The only other optionis blood thinners.

424
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,480
This is not a fat guy with plaque-filled 
arteries and a swollen heart.

425
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
He's a guy whose brain is trying to his heart.

426
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,590
So buy him a girlfriend.Make him happy.

427
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,060
That might make you happy.

428
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,150
The only thing that'll make him happy is amy.

429
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,020
So keep him away from her.

430
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,330
He has a myocardial infarction every time 
she walks in the room.

431
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,060
What do you think will happen to his heart 
when we tell him he can never see her again?

432
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,580
he needs a shrink.

433
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,620
Chase's idea is as good as any.

434
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,100
Because short of fryingh is brain 
and wiping amy out,

435
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,610
he's screwed.

436
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,900
We need cuddy.

437
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,160
Why?

438
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,670
So you can tell her why you need to 
fry a guy's brain.

439
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,840
The guy's heart isn't working
and you want to shock his brain.

440
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,980
Electroshock therapy is the only way 
to erase his memories of amy

441
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,140
and stop the brain's chemical attack on the heart.

442
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,750
This is 1940.The problem can be 
controlled with anti-depressants.

443
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,770
Cameron?

444
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,400
Anti-depressants would inhibit his 
autonomic nervous system,speed up the attacks.

445
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,840
Lmno, ptu, blood thinners,none of 
them will solve this problem.

446
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,290
The man's got a real-life harlequin romance in his head.

447
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,820
We're gonna pull out the 1940 playbook.

448
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,620
Bilateral electrodes,
high stimulus sine-wave intensity,

449
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,900
turning that dial all the way to 11.

450
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,490
It's basic brain chemistry.

451
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,200
We interrupt protein synthesis,
altering the neuro transmitter system.

452
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,600
End results: No memories,no amy,no problem.

453
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,740
Go ahead.

454
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,120
You heard the lady.Go plug him in.

455
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,530
Am I really that pathetic?

456
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,930
What are you talking about?

457
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,450
If I had pitche delectroshock therapy 

458
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,360
as a cure for broken heart syndrome any other time,

459
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,640
you'd have dug in and maybe try 
a hundred other useless things first.

460
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,910
So either you're actually beginning to trust me,

461
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,870
or you just feel sorry for me.

462
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,210
You presented a reasonable argument.

463
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,970
You were clear-headed and non-impulsive about it.

464
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,100
Never once used the word "moron."

465
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,660
The rehab's working, house.

466
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,040
you'll still be able to perform routine 
functions like walking, talking,tying your shoes.

467
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,450
The treatment targets the anterior cingulate cortex.

468
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,560
It should only affect your experiential memories.

469
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,690
So my parents?My childhood?

470
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,330
If this works,you won't remember them.

471
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,340
Or your fire fighting training.

472
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,350
And amy.

473
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,050
Are you okay with that?

474
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,590
I wouldn't miss her,right?

475
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,130
Tell amy how you feel
because if she loves you

476
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,670
no.I won't do that to her.

477
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,320
Or to my brother.

478
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,500
You're effectively killing 
who you are just to keep this secret.

479
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,640
She doesn't love me.

480
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,520
Caterpillar?

481
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,860
Lower intestine  with ulcerative colitis.

482
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,440
You crash art therapy classes 
just for the adrenaline rush?

483
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,170
Cuddy wouldn't get off the phone 

484
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,780
until I promised I'd come and see for myself.

485
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,610
I gotta admit,this move I did not expect.

486
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,550
Well, don't tell anyone,but the photos of 
smiling people in the brochure

487
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,230
is just marketing.

488
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,210
Well, you're obviously making an effort.

489
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,800
So i suppose the next step is for me to...

490
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,800
talk to the da.

491
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,560
Which you have no intention of doing.

492
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,080
No.

493
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,310
So words mean nothing,actions mean nothing.
What the hell is left?

494
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,300
You son of a bitch!

495
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,250
What about your words?Your actions?

496
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,880
"Gotta get house cleaned up.

497
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,620
Gotta get him to show some humility."

498
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,900
But when it comes to actually doing something,

499
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,420
you've proved that all you care about

500
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,480
is bitch-slapping a guy 
who refused to kiss your ass.

501
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,770
You ever trust an addict?

502
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,610
You ever give one the benefit of the doubt?

503
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,920
How many times did it work out for you

504
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,140
yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

505
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:49,760
So you were screwed over by your wife,
your mother, your partner.

506
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,440
But you keep sending them christmas cards

507
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,080
while you take it out on everyone else.

508
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,760
No more christmas cards.

509
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,190
No, I learned...

510
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,900
people like you...

511
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,000
even your actions lie.

512
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm scared.

513
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,680
I know.

514
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,800
I'm gonna give you a muscle relaxant 
so your body doesn't convulse.

515
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,320
Count backwards from ten.

516
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,130
10...

517
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,010
9...

518
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,950
8...

519
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,930
7...

520
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,010
go.

521
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,870
what's your name?

522
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,560
Derek.

523
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,810
Heart sounds good.

524
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,810
Do you know what city we're in?

525
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,610
No.

526
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,700
Would you be okay with a couple of visitors?

527
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,750
Derek, it's--it's me.Brock.

528
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,560
I'm your brother,and when you get out of here
you'll be staying with me.

529
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,140
I'm amy.

530
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,680
I'm your friend.

531
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,370
I'm sorry.

532
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,990
But I don't remember either of you.

533
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,790
we've give him four rounds of electroshock.

534
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,230
The charge made his voice a little higher,
but the ekg and bpare good.

535
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,820
Good.

536
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,630
We're gonna give him his last round in the morning,

537
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,780
then be in court for your hearing.

538
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,220
Thanks.

539
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,010
I'm gonna stay here.

540
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,360
Monitor derek.

541
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,400
Thanks for the update.

542
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,370
My next condolence callis arriving.

543
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,350
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

544
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
I got you something.

545
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,550
Nice.

546
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,400
I figured it might help make a 
good impression on the judge.

547
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,890
It's not that nice.

548
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,960
I had no business blaming you for any of this.

549
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,020
I know you were just trying to help me.

550
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:39,410
Protect me.That's what friends do.

551
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,980
Is this an apology?

552
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,670
Part of the program.

553
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,070
You don't like it,I can stop.

554
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,190
Not at all.

555
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:54,650
It's just so...unfamiliar.

556
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,040
Please, keep going.

557
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,330
He looks lost.

558
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,780
It's gonna take him a while.

559
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,830
Brock's pulling a double shift.

560
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,640
He can't stand to see him this way.

561
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,060
Derek's gonna need him, amy.

562
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,320
I know the timing isn't great 
with a wedding coming up.

563
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,550
What wedding?

564
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,890
Yours.You and brock.

565
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,650
We're not getting married.

566
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,090
We don't even date.

567
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,750
Why would you think we're getting married?

568
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,740
When you first offered dr. House the chance 
to check into drug rehab,how did he respond?

569
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,920
He told me to get ou tof his office.

570
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,070
I warned him that...

571
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,400
he could end up in prison and 
lose his medical license.

572
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,850
If he was concerned,he didn't show it.

573
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,980
so you continued your investigation.

574
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,950
Yes, which is what lead me to the hospital pharmacy.

575
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,780
Turn it off.

576
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,860
I thought I told you never to call me 
when I'm on trial.

577
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,690
The memories were false.
We fried his brain for nothing.

578
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,670
Whatever was killing him before is still there.

579
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,700
We did an mri.

580
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,160
There's a slight hypoperfusion 
in the anterior cortex.

581
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,600
What did you find when you checked the pharmacy log?

582
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,150
Hold on, mr. Vickers.

583
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,480
Thanks, your honor.Hard to hear.

584
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,930
Did you test for clotting time and lv function?

585
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,090
I believe this is a medical emergency,your honor.

586
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,660
His blood's normal,and his heart's 
pumping it up to the brain.

587
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,100
But it's not all getting there.

588
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,450
Something's obstructing the blood flow.

589
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,930
Dr. House, you were given adequate notice 
to make arrangements for your patients.

590
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,890
There's no hyper intensity to suggest 
a foreign body near the region.

591
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,280
And no signs of infection 
or vascular malformation.

592
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,750
- It's lower down. 
- Dr. House, hang up.

593
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,410
- The cytology on the lp doesn't suggest a tumor. 
- Now!

594
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,920
Hang on a second.

595
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,600
Does your voice always get that high 
and annoying when you're angry?

596
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,760
Do you want to go to jail?

597
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,930
No thank you.

598
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,640
Set him up for a selective vertebral angiography.

599
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,040
I'm on my way.

600
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,120
Dr. House--

601
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,110
house, sit down!

602
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,740
Why?I'm bored.

603
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,340
There's nothing I can say or do that's 
gonna make a difference here.

604
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,850
If you leave this room,
I will find you in contempt.

605
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,170
Get a recess.

606
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,130
Are you out of your mind?

607
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,640
They said they wanted me there,
but I don't think they liked me.

608
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,020
His voice isn't high because of the electrical charges.

609
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,990
It's another symptom of menopause.

610
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,310
His system keeps getting hit by women's issues.

611
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,880
So let's follow the pattern.

612
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:43,050
What might obstruct the blood flow 
that's more common in women than men?

613
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,230
Is the catheter in?

614
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,180
go back to court.

615
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,260
We'll let you know the results.

616
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,360
Shut up and wire him.

617
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:53,150
Center the image on the interpeduncular cistern.

618
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,120
Keep it moving at 30 frames per second.

619
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,860
If you think the arteries are narrowing,

620
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,440
we're gonna need still shots,
which we can do without you.

621
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,610
The problem is not how wide the road is.

622
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,230
There's a guy with a squeegee on the sidewalk

623
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,130
flagging cars, that's what's causing the slow down.

624
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,780
We find him,we find the problem.

625
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,030
He's wired.

626
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,520
- Go. 
- Injecting the dye.

627
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,640
Blood's in the capillaries.

628
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,430
There.

629
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,800
Mr. Squeegee.

630
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:26,200
Spinal meningioma pushing on the 
nerves to the vocal chords.

631
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,600
Creates the voice change.

632
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,190
And that nerve just happens to live right near 

633
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,700
the meningeal branch of the vertebral artery.

634
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,100
Obstructs the blood flow to the brain.

635
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,150
Brain malfunctions,creating false memories.

636
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,690
Memories cause love.

637
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,450
Love kills.

638
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,210
And we didn't completely screw up.

639
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,170
Cleaning the slate bought us time 
to find the real problem.

640
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,670
On the other hand,if we'd been better,
we wouldn't have needed the time.

641
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,560
Schedule him for surgery.
Dig that thing out.

642
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,100
He can start enjoying real misery 
instead of the fake stuff.

643
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,410
House.

644
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,180
I just heard that you apologized to wilson.

645
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,920
Detoxing.

646
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,770
I didn't know what I was saying.

647
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,360
Excuse me.

648
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,750
I have to go to jail.

649
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,120
What is your position at princeton-plains boro?

650
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,240
Chief administrator and dean of medicine.

651
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,150
and you're responsible for oversight of the pharmacy?

652
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,210
Yes.

653
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,650
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

654
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,860
I hope you don't mind that 
we continued on without you.

655
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,200
I said I was sorry.

656
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,430
There's no need to be sarcastic.

657
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,030
What is this?

658
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,940
That's our prescription sign-out log 
from december 24.

659
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,170
Does that appear to be dr. House's signature?

660
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,830
- Yes.
- What has he signed for?

661
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,330
a prescription for oxycodone in 
the name of patient larry zebalusky.

662
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,720
- And did those pills ever reach that patient? 
- No.

663
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,560
- Why?  
- He was already dead.

664
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,350
And dr. House knew this.

665
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,530
Yes.

666
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,160
so...

667
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,500
dr. House had no legal or medical basis 
for acquiring that oxycodone?

668
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,330
Dr. Cuddy?

669
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,050
He never got the pills.

670
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,210
It's his signature.

671
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,960
The log is strictly controlled.

672
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,220
Dr. House did pick up a prescription,
but it wasn't for oxycodone.

673
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,200
It says oxycodone.

674
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:43,050
- You testified it was-- 
- I know.But it wasn't oxycodone.

675
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,570
Dr. Wilson informed me that dr.House already tried

676
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,630
to steal the pain medication of this patient,

677
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,930
which made clear to me that dr. House was in

678
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,910
a particularly vulnerable and desperate state.

679
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,940
So I went to the pharmacy and I swapped bottles.

680
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,260
Dr. House only got a bottle with placebos.

681
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,400
I understand your impulse to 
protect a valued colleague.

682
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,870
I have it right here on the inventory report

683
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,930
your honor, she's lyinG.
She's obviously forged that report.

684
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,330
In light of this evidence...

685
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,500
if this is real, why didn't she mention it earlier?

686
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,350
I move to dismiss this case.

687
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,750
There is other evidence,your honor.

688
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,040
Everyone shut up and sit down.

689
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:21,370
Dr. Cuddy, why are you only now 
coming forward with this?

690
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,060
I guess I never expected it to go this far.

691
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,390
The witness is excused.

692
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,530
Your honor, you can't serisly believe--

693
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,990
dr. House, please stand.

694
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:42,320
My suspicion is your boss--

695
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,320
my suspicion is you have better friends 
than you deserve.

696
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,810
Rules and laws apply to everyone.

697
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,840
You are not as special as you think.

698
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,530
But detective tritter chose to make you so.

699
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,030
Detective,I don't know exactly what's going on here,

700
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:07,000
but I am sure that this man is 
not flooding the streets with cocaine.

701
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,720
I'm also certain that,knowing dr. House,

702
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,910
he must've done something to set you off.

703
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,140
But you're gonna have to live with it.

704
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:20,470
Given dr. Cuddy's testimony,I'm not going to 
allow this to proceed to jury.

705
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,020
Case dismissed.

706
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,250
Court is adjourned. 

707
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,720
Dr house, you're still guilty of 
contempt for that little walkout earlier.

708
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,370
You'll be spending the night in jail,

709
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,640
and after that, you're going right back to your rehab.

710
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,460
Bailiff, take dr. House into custody.

711
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,290
Dr. House.

712
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,360
So should I be looking for you in the shadows?

713
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,890
Flinch every time a car backfires?

714
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,380
Good luck.

715
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,050
I hope i'm wrong about you.

716
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,680
we got the meningioma.

717
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,350
Your brain should start generating 
real memories again.

718
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,780
What do I do when I get out?

719
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,230
You have people who love you.

720
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,250
They'll take care of you.

721
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,800
You start over.

722
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,930
surprised to see you're not spooning 
your way through the walls.

723
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,570
So, what do you say?

724
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,030
How about a conjugal visit to celebrate?

725
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,090
There's nothing to celebrate, house.

726
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,450
You made me perjure myself.

727
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,870
Fabricate evidence.

728
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,430
You make everyone around you worse for being there.

729
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:13,190
The only bright spot is that 
now I own your ass.

730
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,210
When you get out of rehab
you're gonna be pulling double clinic duty,

731
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,250
giving lectures to students helping me find donors,

732
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,760
and pretty much anything else I ask.

733
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,450
You got it?

734
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,790
Your buprenorphine.

735
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,570
You get these from the pharmacy of from voldemort?

736
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,690
Voldemort.Why, what difference does it--

737
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,040
That's vicodin.

738
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,770
He's been slipping you vicodin?

739
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:57,780
No!

740
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,670
He'd be risking his minimum wage job to do that.

741
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,130
The whole time?

742
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,350
My higher power said it was okay.

743
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,180
Nothing's changed?

744
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,800
Nothing's changed.

745
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,780
The apology.

746
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,500
You didn't need to do that to make this work.

747
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,040
Believe what you want.

748
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,020
Good night, house.

749
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,180
I'll see you tomorrow.

750
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,410
Good night, wilson.
