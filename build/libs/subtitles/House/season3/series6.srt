1
00:00:00,076 --> 00:00:04,492
So, you got a Green Beret,
a Navy SEAL, and a sister from Brooklyn.

2
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:07,549
The General hands each
of them a gun and says,

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:09,081
"Your spouse is seated
next door in a room in a chair.

4
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:10,694
"In order to pass this test,
you must go inside and kill them."

5
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:12,120
Immediately, the Green Beret says,

6
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,838
"No, sir, I could never kill my wife.
I just can't do it."

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,006
General looks at him and says,
"You know what?

8
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,157
"You ain't got what it takes.
Take your wife and go on home."

9
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:23,134
Navy SEAL then heads in.
Five minutes later, comes out--

10
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:24,560
Tears strolling down his face.

11
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:26,724
"I tried, I tried, I tried!
I just can't do it.

12
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,133
"She looked so beautiful in the chair.
I can't do it."

13
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,984
General looks at him and says,
"You know what?

14
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,531
"You ain't got what it takes."

15
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:35,522
Finally, sister from Brooklyn
strolls in with a swagger.

16
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,931
Shots rang out! There's banging.
There's screaming. It's going crazy!

17
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:41,852
Suddenly, everything goes silent.

18
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:45,542
General says,
"Well, what the hell happened  inside?"

19
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,982
Sister from Brooklyn screams back,

20
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:50,940
"The damn gun had blanks in it! So I
had to beat him to death with my bare--"

21
00:00:52,697 --> 00:00:53,640
What the hell?

22
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:55,593
A little bit of warning
would've been nice!

23
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:58,223
Sound of a saw cutting a hole
in a wall wasn't warning enough?

24
00:00:58,227 --> 00:00:59,170
Bite me!

25
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:10,322
What, are you kidding me?

26
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:12,140
Tub-o-goo there has
gotta be over six bills.

27
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:14,211
You ain't gonna lift
him with a couple of blankets.

28
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:15,600
You got a better idea, Einstein?

29
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:16,892
Yeah, just roll him off.

30
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:19,960
He's already dead.
It ain't like he's gonna feel it.

31
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:21,463
How the hell does a guy get that big?

32
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:24,562
If we roll him off, he's likely to go
through the floor and take us with him.

33
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:26,382
Ready? All right, one, two-- Lift!

34
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:30,513
Come on, man.

35
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,780
- Me? You're the kielbasa king.
- Wasn't me.

36
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,150
Whoa, wasn't me either.

37
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:40,303
Don't look at me.

38
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:46,020
Please tell me dead guys can fart.

39
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:48,191
Of course. Dead bodies
are full of all sorts of gases.

40
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:51,222
But a dead body can't tighten the
sphincter. You need one to make a fart.

41
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:54,371
- No, you need a loose sphincter.
- Did you check his femoral?

42
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:55,473
No.

43
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:56,772
He peed all over himself.

44
00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:59,832
Look, I've heard dead bodies moan,
groan, hiss--

45
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:01,833
I've even seen them
sit straight up on a gurney.

46
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:03,050
Trust me. His skin's cold.

47
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,251
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
He's not breathing.

48
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:07,013
- He's got a pulse! - No way.

49
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:08,611
Get me an ambu bag and EKG.

50
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,942
It's thready, but it's there.
Let's get him in the basket. Ready?

51
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:13,642
One, two, lift!

53
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:49,981
46-year-old guy in a coma.

54
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:52,731
Doesn't appear to be anything
wrong with him except for the fact

55
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:55,852
that he weighs over 600 pounds.
What time does he usually get in?

56
00:02:55,855 --> 00:02:57,503
Any time between 8:00 and 10:00.

57
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:59,283
- Did you say 600? - At least.

58
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:01,443
Biggest scale we
got only goes up to 350.

59
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:03,703
But this guy's waistline
is over seven feet.

60
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:06,803
Which means he's a diabetic
with blood thicker than pancake batter.

61
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,653
No mystery there, or much we can do.

62
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:09,770
Blood sugar's normal.

63
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:13,323
Cholesterol's lower than mine.
Tox screen's clean. No sign of trauma.

64
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,001
Sure there wasn't a mix-up at the lab?

65
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:15,952
Three times?

66
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:18,452
It's almost 11:00. Where is House?

67
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:00,592
Excusez-moi, garcon!

68
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:04,140
Hello?!

69
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:06,762
It's 11:00.

70
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:11,593
Which means my friend is ready for his
sponge bath. And I shouldn't be here.

71
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:15,310
Hey, Gomer Pyle!

72
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:18,021
I know you can hear me.

73
00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:29,903
I think you mean Barney Fife.

74
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:33,180
So many great idiot
icons to choose from.

75
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,413
You need time to think of some more?

76
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:39,560
-  Either arraign me or let me go.
- No problem.

77
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:41,122
Which do you prefer?

78
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:53,381
What took you so long?

79
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:56,132
Sorry, I didn't have 15
grand in my loose change jar.

80
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,002
What the hell did you do?

81
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,260
Nothing.

82
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:02,413
The motorcycle was impounded.
That explains the speeding, DUI,

83
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,960
and driving without a license.

84
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:05,352
The fact that you're you

85
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,953
explains the illegal possession
of narcotics. And resisting arrest.

86
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:12,650
Where's your car?

87
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,031
What happened?

88
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:17,882
Some idiot cop with crotch rot obviously
thought that I didn't treat him

89
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,172
with the deference due
to a man of his stature.

90
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:21,671
He trumped up a traffic stop.

91
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:23,902
Next thing I know,
I'm sharing a cage with a guy

92
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,102
who thinks that showers are
the way the devil gets inside you.

93
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:29,650
- Does Cuddy know?
- Everything she needs to.

94
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:33,413
- I'm innocent. - Till proven guilty.

95
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:36,431
Guy wanted to punish me.
He did it. It's over.

96
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:38,171
Better get yourself a lawyer.

97
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:39,120
Already got one.

98
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:41,942
You know what they say about
the lawyer who has himself as a client?

99
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:43,373
Same thing they say about the doctor

100
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:46,420
who lends 15 grand to a friend
he knows can't pay him back.

101
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:48,080
Relax, you'll get it.

102
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:49,982
Where am I gonna take off to?

103
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:57,542
Does Salma Hayek
live in Mexico or Spain?

104
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:03,123
There's nothing abnormal in
the EEG or in the neurological exam.

105
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:04,722
I'm guessing it's food related.

106
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:08,400
Improperly prepared puffer fish
can have toxins that could cause a coma

107
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:10,451
and might not show up on the tox screen.

108
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:13,830
- Where do you think he is?
- He's probably at the track.

109
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:16,180
If he was there he'd tell us
so we don't have to page him.

110
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:18,850
If it was a puffer fish,
he'd be dead in six to eight hours tops.

111
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,352
He's been in a coma at least 24.

112
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:23,363
The guy didn't get to 600
pounds eating a load of sushi.

113
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:25,101
What if he was in a motorcycle accident?

114
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:27,701
Explains the coma.
But how did he get back in bed?

115
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,950
Oh-- Cameron's talking about House.

116
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,642
- You ever see how he drives?
- No. We haven't.

117
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:34,891
But I have seen how many
pills he's been popping lately.

118
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:37,410
I wouldn't be surprised if
he's in a coma somewhere himself.

119
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,460
If I am, this is one lame hallucination.

120
00:06:39,628 --> 00:06:40,551
What happened to you?

121
00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:44,011
If you ever end up in a bar with
the Cambridge Women's Heavyweight Eight,

122
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:46,863
do not accept an offer
of an upside down kamikaze shot.

123
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:48,791
- We have a case.
- Fat guy in a coma, I know.

124
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:49,891
- Cuddy found you?- No,

125
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:52,992
but the wall between Wilson's office
and this one is thinner than you think.

126
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:55,960
Which means we need to stop talking
about what a pathetic loser he is.

127
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:58,360
Start treating Jabba
for Pickwickian Syndrome.

128
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:02,530
His 96 double Zs are probably putting
pressure on his chest, suffocating him.

129
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,313
- CO2 and oxygen stats are normal.
- For you and me.

130
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:07,053
What's normal for a hippopotamus?

131
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,541
Get a detailed medical history.

132
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:09,891
From who? He was brought in alone.

133
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,343
And I doubt a guy who weighs 600
pounds bothers with annual physicals.

134
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:15,190
Talk  to the neighbors. Search the house.

135
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:17,991
Let's see what else Shamu's
been up to besides eating.

136
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,373
This conversation is over

137
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:23,823
because I have officially run
out of clever things to call the guy.

138
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:35,090
It's hard to believe you can even attach
this much flesh to a human skeleton.

139
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:37,661
I wouldn't exactly call this attached.

140
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:41,110
This is ridiculous. A person
shouldn't be able to eat themselves

141
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:43,082
into oblivion and
then just expect everyone

142
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:44,833
to pull out the stops to fix everything.

143
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:47,720
What are we supposed to do?
Refuse treatment to anyone who's obese?

144
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:50,024
Come on, gimme a break.
The guy's not obese.

145
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,133
He's not even morbidly obese.
He's suicidal.

146
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,074
People who attempt suicide get treated.

147
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,010
Plenty  of noncompliant diabetics don't.

148
00:07:57,015 --> 00:08:00,562
We don't give drug addicts dialysis.
Or alcoholics liver transplants.

149
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:02,321
What is your problem?

150
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:05,020
You get beat up by a
gang of fat kids when you were

151
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:08,010
- in grade school or something?
- Yeah, I'm the one with the problem.

152
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:13,091
So, um, I think his bedroom's through
there. And kitchen's to the left.

153
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:15,983
Have you seen any changes
in his personality?

154
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,793
Any trouble with memory or balance?

155
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,563
No, but I really don't
see him that often.

156
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:22,920
He's not unfriendly or anything.

157
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,180
I guess he just likes
to keep to himself.

158
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:28,763
I think he only gave me a spare
set of keys because I gave him mine.

159
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:31,640
What?

160
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:32,460
Nothing.

161
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:35,163
Just reminds me of someone
I know who is unfriendly.

162
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,050
Does George have a job?

163
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:39,512
He has a headhunting
business he runs from home.

164
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:41,723
Occasionally he'll
interview people here. But

165
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,471
he does most of it over the phone.

166
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:47,580
He loves to cook.

167
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:49,712
And eat, obviously.

168
00:08:50,337 --> 00:08:52,573
Four-course gourmet
meals almost every night.

169
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:53,882
Sometimes for lunch too.

170
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:57,023
Do you know if he ever uses
any unpasteurized cheese or wild game?

171
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:57,970
I'm not sure.

172
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:01,200
He gets all his groceries delivered
from that market down on Alden.

173
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,200
They probably know.

174
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:05,820
He have any friends?

175
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:06,782
No,

176
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:09,153
I mean-- Sometimes women do come by.

177
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:11,330
Young, attractive--

178
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,883
Never the same one twice,
if you know what I mean.

179
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:14,612
I see.

180
00:09:14,616 --> 00:09:17,862
There can't be many women
who'd want to be with a guy like him.

181
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,013
It's usually worst in the morning.

182
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:28,462
Especially if I've slept on my arm.

183
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:31,562
If I sleep on my back or
with my arms out, I'm usually okay.

184
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:36,220
So your arm only hurts after
you lie on top of it all night.

185
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:37,600
Yeah.

186
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:40,510
Well, have you thought about,

187
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:41,522
I don't know--

188
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:42,471
Not doing that?

189
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:45,542
Yeah, but it's how I sleep.
That's how I've always slept.

190
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:47,423
- Well, there's always surgery.
- To do what?

191
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:49,011
Clean out some cartilage or something?

192
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:52,343
You're not sleeping on some cartilage.
You're sleeping on your arm.

193
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:56,113
- You want to remove my arm?
- Well, it is your left.

194
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:57,401
A guy's gotta sleep.

195
00:09:58,508 --> 00:09:59,633
Are you insane?

196
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:12,522
I see spending a night
in jail hasn't humbled you a bit.

197
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:14,821
While following my
every move is flattering,

198
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:17,433
a single rose on my doorstep
each morning would be

199
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,561
more enticing.

200
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:20,472
Just bringing your boss up to speed.

201
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:22,771
Which I guess you didn't
feel was necessary.

202
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:25,230
You gonna add that
to my list of charges?

203
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:28,382
People who are innocent tend
not to try to hide their arrest.

204
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:32,000
Is that based on your years
of experience arresting innocent people?

205
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:36,501
The way you're going at that gum,

206
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:38,923
it's obviously not
having the desired effect.

207
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:39,891
You're the addict.

208
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:42,282
You're gonna be back
on the butts in a month.

209
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:46,183
You're just taking out your frustration
on me because my meds actually work.

210
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:48,542
Why don't you quit while you're ahead,

211
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:49,243
before you end up

212
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:52,493
as a security guard working
the night shift at some strip mall?

213
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:55,850
I think working around a bunch of nurses

214
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:58,852
has given you a false sense
of your ability to intimidate.

215
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:08,750
Who's that?

216
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:14,150
Apparently Cuddy's widened her sperm
donor search to include Neanderthals.

217
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:17,060
Cuddy's looking for a sperm donor?

218
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:19,080
It's a joke.

219
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,612
Like Cuddy would ever want a kid.

220
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:23,083
Or a kid would ever want Cuddy.

221
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:24,582
Hello? That's why it's funny.

222
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:26,903
Why are you guys here?

223
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:28,320
It's not Pickwick's.

224
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:30,803
Intubation and steroids
have had no effect.

225
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:33,782
Except maybe to cause whatever it
is to get worse. He's got a fever now.

226
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:34,842
What'd you find out?

227
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:37,813
That you and George have the same
taste in home furnishings and women.

228
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:39,613
Danish modern and Russian gymnasts?

229
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:42,853
Pianos and prostitutes. We should
do an LP, look for neurosyphilis.

230
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:44,750
- It's not syphilis. - How do you know?

231
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:47,000
Because you get STDs
from people you trust.

232
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:49,323
People you don't feel the
need to protect yourself from.

233
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,962
Whatever he has is connected to his gut.
Not what's below it.

234
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:53,512
MRI his brain, look for clots.

235
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:56,400
Weight limit on the
MRI machine is 450 pounds.

236
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:59,201
- So do a CT.- Limit's 350.

237
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:01,213
Then just start treatment.

238
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:02,533
We give him blood thinners and

239
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:05,042
the coma's caused by a bleed
instead of a clot, we'd kill him.

240
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:07,990
Either start treatment,
or start building a stronger MRI.

241
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:11,052
Whatever you do, do it fast.
The longer he stays in a coma,

242
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:13,202
the less likely it
is he'll ever wake up.

243
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:17,592
There's no way.

244
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:21,222
His head's the only part
that we have to get in the machine.

245
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:22,642
If we can just get him on the table.

246
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:24,573
We get him on the table,
we break the table.

247
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:27,043
We break the table,
hospital's out a million dollars.

248
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,100
And we're out of our jobs.

249
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:30,290
The weight limit's obviously
just an estimation.

250
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:32,512
It's not like it can
hold 450 pounds fine--

251
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:34,501
it'll instantly collapse under 451.

252
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:37,932
He's not 1 pound over,
he's 150 pounds over.

253
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:41,931
I  don't care. He still deserves the
same standard of care as anyone else.

254
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:44,651
And you believe the machine
will stand on principle?

255
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:51,660
You guys gonna help or not?

256
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,260
- How much does this guy weigh? - 440.

257
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:59,222
- Looks like a lot more than that.
- It's because he's lying down.

258
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:01,492
You guys ready? One, two, three--

259
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:19,351
Here.

260
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:20,441
What's this?

261
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:22,870
I made some calls for you.

262
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:25,611
The guy's the best criminal
attorney in Princeton.

263
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:26,912
Thanks, but I don't need it.

264
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,753
I assume you told Inspector Clouseau

265
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:30,703
that I have a valid
prescription for the Vicodin.

266
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,441
Yeah, and I assume you did as well.
Did it make a difference?

267
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,393
The guy's pissed.

268
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:37,653
And with the DEA now treating
pain doctors like Columbian--

269
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:40,080
I'm not a pain doctor.
I'm a pain patient.

270
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:42,681
Tell it to your lawyer.

271
00:13:57,345 --> 00:14:00,453
No midline shifts,
no bleeds, clots, infarcts.

272
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,213
I don't see any edema either.

273
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:03,470
So what do we do now?

274
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,012
An LP.

275
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:08,111
Even if it's not an STD, a fever
points toward some sort of infection.

276
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,973
I'm not sure we can
do an LP on a guy his size.

277
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:17,852
What? You have to be able to palpate
the spine to know where to go.

278
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,610
We could use fluoroscopy to guide us.

279
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:21,501
He's still gotta be
able to bring his knees up

280
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,570
and bend forward in
order to open a space--

281
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:29,191
George, it's all right.
You're in a hospital.

282
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:30,540
Calm down, man! Calm down!

283
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:32,043
Get him out already!

284
00:14:32,046 --> 00:14:32,993
I'm trying.

285
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:38,783
We're gonna get you out.

286
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,741
We still have no idea why
he was in the coma to begin with.

287
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:49,692
Or why he woke up.

288
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,063
It was probably just
some sort of head trauma.

289
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,900
And we missed the swelling because...

290
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:56,690
Well, his head's already swollen.

291
00:14:56,986 --> 00:14:59,140
A bump on the noggin
doesn't explain the fever.

292
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:02,013
An infection made worse by the steroids
we gave him for Pickwick's does.

293
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,712
He's not worse. He's better.

294
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,501
We just replaced the last MRI you broke.

295
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:10,321
Referring to the fund-raising
funbags by the royal "we" now?

296
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,192
Let  me explain cause and effect to you.

297
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:15,091
I specifically told them
to skip the boring testing part

298
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:16,790
and jump right to
the dangerous treatment.

299
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:19,362
You blow stuff up,
makes my life miserable.

300
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:21,842
Makes me need to make
your life miserable.

301
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:23,593
He's telling the truth.

302
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:32,013
Kids these days. Got no respect
for other people's property.

303
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,712
Repairmen cost less than lawyers.

304
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:37,541
Morbid  obesity is a
legally defined disability.

305
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:40,650
Which means if we'd denied access
to the MRI, he could've sued us for

306
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:42,902
discrimination as well as malpractice.

307
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:44,463
This was your idea?

308
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:46,132
Yeah.

309
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,891
Looks like Cameron's gonna be
having a lot more ideas in the future.

310
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:02,760
Who knew that being bloated
and bitchy could actually come in handy?

311
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:03,430
Shut up.

312
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:05,923
- What if it is hormones?
- It's not hormones.

313
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,253
I'm talking about George.

314
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,893
Acute adrenal insufficiency
could cause a temporary coma.

315
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:12,681
A glandular problem would cause
his temperature to be low, not high.

316
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:14,920
- Maybe the fever's not related.
- If it's not related,

317
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:17,803
- there's nothing to talk about.
- We should do an ACTH stimulation test

318
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,983
and check his skin
for acanthosis nigricans.

319
00:16:19,988 --> 00:16:22,721
Or the fever is related
and so are the prostitutes.

320
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,123
We should do a full STD panel
and check his genitals for chancres.

321
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:29,651
We should do nothing. Just keep
him a couple of days for observation.

322
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:30,783
If it doesn't get any worse,

323
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:33,833
it was probably just a hematoma
that dissipated on its own.

324
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,380
Or we do all of the above.

325
00:16:37,616 --> 00:16:41,060
You check his belly for patches.
You check underneath it for sores.

326
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:42,371
And you...

327
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:44,581
Just sit on your ass.

328
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:54,151
Acanthosis nigricans is
a hyperpigmentation of the skin.

329
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:57,261
It usually indicates some
sort of hormonal imbalance.

330
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:59,071
There's nothing wrong with my hormones.

331
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:02,370
It's the first thing every
doctor I've ever gone to has checked.

332
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:05,441
Then it's the blood pressure.
Then it's gotta be diabetes.

333
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:08,390
They all figure there's
gotta be something wrong with me.

334
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,970
You having any problems
with your vision?

335
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:13,871
No, I have nystagmus.
I've had it since birth. I'm fine.

336
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:17,312
You're not. You were in a coma for two
days. There's something wrong with you.

337
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:21,141
Was something wrong with me.
Now I'm better. Now I'd like to go home.

338
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:23,790
A coma's not like a stomach ache.

339
00:17:23,796 --> 00:17:26,330
You can't just shrug it off
and hope it's not anything serious.

340
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,813
My company places a
lot of insurance executives.

341
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:31,822
There are over 300,000
deaths caused each year

342
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:36,350
by medical mistakes and
hospital-associated infections.

343
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:38,282
I'll come in for tests.

344
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:41,890
There are over 400,000 deaths
caused by obesity-related illnesses.

345
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:45,160
CDC says those figures
are a gross overestimation.

346
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:48,680
George, you ever notice you
don't see a lot of obese old men?

347
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:50,660
If I'm gonna have a heart attack,

348
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:52,751
I would rather it be caused

349
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:56,561
by a perfect pan-roasted Ris de Veau

350
00:17:57,366 --> 00:18:01,593
than running 26 miles for no reason
other than to brag that I can do it.

351
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:05,673
Or to have a MRI machine
break in the middle of a procedure!

352
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,412
We're sorry about that.

353
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:10,040
It was the only way to rule
out a stroke or brain hemorrhage.

354
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,191
And now that you have,

355
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:13,253
when can I go?

356
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:23,481
It's probably her mom.

357
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:25,221
I bet she's huge.

358
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:27,270
She's from the Midwest.

359
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:31,042
- Since when do you eat beets?
- Since I was five.

360
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:34,203
And who are we talking about? You know,
just in case you need me to chime in.

361
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,813
And tell you're a lunatic at some point.

362
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:36,980
Cameron-- she's lying,

363
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:39,203
destroying hospital equipment,

364
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:40,391
telling Cuddy off.

365
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:43,193
I gotta find out where
she got the fat scratch fever.

366
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:45,551
Yeah, you definitely better
get to the bottom of that.

367
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,333
I heard Cuddy gave
you the name of a lawyer.

368
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,593
Or it could just be pity.

369
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:50,893
She feels guilty about
being born beautiful.

370
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:53,781
So she overcompensates
by being nice to ugly people.

371
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:55,941
It would explain why she
gets along so well with you.

372
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:58,653
From what I hear,
the patient reminds her of you, not me.

373
00:18:58,657 --> 00:18:59,603
Call the lawyer.

374
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:02,053
Cameron sees a clump
of dirt and she thinks of me.

375
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:04,361
Or a lump of something else.
You're a lunatic.

376
00:19:04,365 --> 00:19:05,313
Call the lawyer.

377
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:11,041
- Very mature. - You started it.

378
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:14,300
Skin exam and ACTH stimulation
test were both normal.

379
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,382
He has nystagmus, but it's congenital.

380
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:17,963
No way it's related to the coma.

381
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:21,180
You say no way, I say...
Yeah, no way.

382
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,811
Blood and urine were negative
for chlamydia, herpes, and syphilis.

383
00:19:23,815 --> 00:19:25,682
Looks like we got ourselves a mystery.

384
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:26,630
Not for long.

385
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:28,162
He wants to be discharged.

386
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:28,842
Oh, sure.

387
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:30,292
Places to go, people to eat.

388
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:33,070
He insists the chance of dying
from a hospital-acquired infection

389
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:35,272
is greater than him dying
from whatever caused his coma.

390
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:39,232
Did you tell him that statistics
also say that he's a big fat idiot?

391
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,323
Yeah, I did.

392
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:43,421
He's not backing down. He says if we
don't discharge him, he'll leave A.M.A.

393
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:46,352
Selectively rational,
stubborn, uncooperative--

394
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:48,413
Maybe you ought to check his leg.

395
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,951
You see what he did there?

396
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:53,562
The patient's like me.

397
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:55,593
The patient's three mes.

398
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:57,391
If I were him...

399
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,621
Maybe it's not such a mystery after all.

400
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:15,241
Enjoying your Salisbury steak?

401
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:18,892
Putting chopped parsley in a hamburger
does not a Salisbury steak make.

402
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:21,800
You must be Dr. House.

403
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:25,380
And you must be full of baloney.

404
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:29,122
- A lot of it. - Ha! Right, fat joke!

405
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:30,731
Always fun.

406
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:33,172
The only people you
can still make fun of.

407
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:34,121
And Christians.

408
00:20:34,758 --> 00:20:35,850
Oh, and black people.

409
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,032
No one in their right
mind comes out of a coma

410
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:41,591
and immediately asks to
go home with an unknown condition.

411
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:43,763
Which means you're either
not in your right mind,

412
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,980
or it's not an unknown condition.
So, what is it?

413
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:47,321
You tried to off yourself?

414
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:49,520
You figure I'm fat, therefore

415
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,361
I hate myself.

416
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:53,700
Yeah, that's a huge leap of logic.

417
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,170
I don't want to die.

418
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:57,671
I just don't want to be here.

419
00:20:57,677 --> 00:20:59,792
Then it's a condition
you've already had diagnosed.

420
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:02,053
Or it's something you know
you've inherited. Let's see.

421
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:05,472
Your stomach has deep-seated feelings
of abandonment written all over it,

422
00:21:05,475 --> 00:21:07,223
which points towards sexual abuse.

423
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:09,191
Although a fear of hospitals...

424
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:12,642
that points to a more specific
traumatic event. So I'm gonna say

425
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:16,022
your mom,
in the hospital, with a candlestick.

426
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:19,313
By candlestick, of course,
I mean inherited OTC deficiency.

427
00:21:19,656 --> 00:21:22,930
My parents are both alive
and well and living in Boca Raton.

428
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:26,452
- Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis?
- I have no idea what that is.

429
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,663
- Leukoencephalopathy. - Will you stop?

430
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,703
If I knew what was wrong,
I would tell you.

431
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:34,322
I'm not an imbecile.

432
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,022
And I'm not miserable.

433
00:21:37,966 --> 00:21:39,012
I'm just overweight.

434
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:46,400
What?

435
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:47,640
When?

436
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:50,911
To be continued.

437
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,910
What are you doing here?

438
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:19,782
Executing a search of the premises.

439
00:22:20,286 --> 00:22:22,232
When you--uh, when you got bailed out,

440
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:25,852
before we could get
a judge to approve this.

441
00:22:27,425 --> 00:22:29,693
I almost didn't bother.

442
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:31,823
I thought for sure you'd come

443
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:34,043
straight home and throw everything out.

444
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:35,582
Rookie mistake.

445
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,242
Never underestimate
the stupidity of an addict.

446
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:40,890
There's gotta be

447
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,742
over 600 Vicodin in here. Which most
DAs would say proves intent to traffic.

448
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:49,061
Even if all you really intended was

449
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:52,370
simply to be wasted 24/7
while practicing medicine.

450
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,561
In case you hadn't noticed,
those are prescription bottles.

451
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:57,900
I'm not an expert on linguistics per se,

452
00:22:58,768 --> 00:23:01,080
but I think that means
they were prescribed.

453
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:07,602
All these were legally prescribed
to a man who's in constant pain

454
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,213
but never misses a day of work?

455
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:11,710
Ever occur to you that's
why I don't miss a day?

456
00:23:11,847 --> 00:23:12,793
Yeah.

457
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,503
Yeah, it crossed my mind.

458
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:15,763
Among other things like

459
00:23:16,257 --> 00:23:19,391
what an unprofessional,
unethical, arrogant ass you are.

460
00:23:21,686 --> 00:23:25,082
Because if you're unprofessional
in one area, it only makes sense.

461
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:29,220
Now, maybe just a few of these

462
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:32,082
are in someone else's name.

463
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:34,722
Forged prescription or...

464
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:36,601
Just

465
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:39,483
swiped from the pharmacy
when nobody's looking...

466
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:43,052
Oh, but, well,

467
00:23:43,987 --> 00:23:45,081
you wouldn't do that.

468
00:23:45,628 --> 00:23:46,572
Right?

469
00:23:53,776 --> 00:23:54,722
Send him home.

470
00:23:54,995 --> 00:23:56,443
Why, you think he's healthy?

471
00:23:56,795 --> 00:23:57,742
Either I'm right,

472
00:23:57,995 --> 00:24:01,042
and he knows what's wrong and
he's just too stubborn to admit it.

473
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:02,890
Or I was right, and it's Pickwick's.

474
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:05,262
The treatment just had a delayed effect.

475
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:07,123
You don't have delayed
effects to oxygen.

476
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:08,770
And Pickwick's doesn't
explain the fever.

477
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:12,111
Being engulfed in an electric blanket
of blubber could explain the fever.

478
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,631
Yesterday, you insisted we
keep him here because of the fever.

479
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:16,383
We have no idea what's
wrong with the guy.

480
00:24:16,385 --> 00:24:18,663
For all we know,
he could be dead in 12 hours.

481
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,291
He does not want our help.

482
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:22,843
Which means he doesn't want your help.

483
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:25,442
He's obviously just rationalizing.
And so are you.

484
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:28,080
You would never give up
this easy if you weren't so busy

485
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:30,133
dealing with your own personal problems.

486
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:32,033
Send him home.

487
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:34,623
What did you tell that cop?

488
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:37,223
- Nothing. - Nothing as in nothing?

489
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:39,210
Or as in nothing that'd
cause him to think

490
00:24:39,217 --> 00:24:40,853
that I have a stash at my apartment?

491
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:44,010
He called to see if I prescribed
the pills. I said yes. That's all.

492
00:24:44,018 --> 00:24:45,723
- Obviously not. - What happened?

493
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:48,451
He searched my house.
Found a buttload of pills.

494
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:51,901
Guy's gotta be prepared for a rainy day.

495
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:54,283
Last I checked, pharmacies
were still open when it rained.

496
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:56,953
And because I never know when
you're gonna be in one of your moods

497
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:58,913
- and cut me off. - Oh, it's my fault?

498
00:24:59,135 --> 00:25:00,832
I'm not the one who talked to the cop.

499
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:03,833
Well, I'm not the one who
put a thermometer in his rectum.

500
00:25:03,915 --> 00:25:06,763
So stop yelling at me and
start talking to your lawyer.

501
00:25:11,158 --> 00:25:12,940
Is there someone who can check on you?

502
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:16,030
Oh, don't worry. There's
gonna be a whole crew of carpenters

503
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:18,403
in my bedroom for
the next week at least.

504
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:23,372
You know, there's an Overeaters
Anonymous meeting here at the hospital.

505
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:27,021
If I wanted to jump out
of airplanes or climb Mt. Everest,

506
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:29,973
would you be telling me
to go to Daredevils Anonymous?

507
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:32,202
I would be worried about you,
just like I am now.

508
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:33,151
Don't be.

509
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:34,653
I enjoy food.

510
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:38,923
I like cooking it. I like looking at it.
I like smelling it.

511
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:41,133
And I especially like eating it.

512
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:45,790
Whatever happens is gonna happen.

513
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:50,400
Ultimately,
it's all out of our control anyway.

514
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:52,810
Why doesn't that philosophy
apply to medical mistakes

515
00:25:52,825 --> 00:25:54,973
and hospital-acquired
infections as well?

516
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:59,663
I'm a complicated man, Dr. Cameron.

517
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,150
But don't worry.

518
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:04,481
I plan on staying
that way for a long time.

519
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:06,233
Wait, let us take
you all the way outside.

520
00:26:06,236 --> 00:26:07,182
I'm fine.

521
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,692
It doesn't matter. It's hospital rules.

522
00:26:09,828 --> 00:26:12,720
Oh, screw the rules.
I've been on my back for four days.

523
00:26:13,045 --> 00:26:14,430
I need the exercise, right?

524
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:16,590
George, come on,
let us just take you to the taxi.

525
00:26:16,596 --> 00:26:20,443
Don't worry. I may not be able
to climb Everest, but I can walk, okay?

526
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:22,391
- George-- - Enough already.

527
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:31,952
George, are you all right?

528
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:38,690
George? You all right?

529
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:40,282
George?

530
00:26:48,576 --> 00:26:51,973
Disorientation and loss of
balance could mean a neurofibromatosis.

531
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:53,822
Where's Chase?

532
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:56,951
Don't know. Haven't seen him since you
told him to sit on his ass yesterday.

533
00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:57,900
Interesting.

534
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:00,841
NF-2 is also inherited.
Which means I was right.

535
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:02,192
You kept saying it was Pickwick's.

536
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,070
Between the first and
the second Pickwick's,

537
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:05,101
I said it was inherited.

538
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:07,061
Whatever. NF-2 doesn't explain fever.

539
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:09,091
I think we should focus
on the coma and the fever.

540
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:11,492
Why? The disorientation and
loss of balance are more recent.

541
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:12,961
The coma was the most severe symptom.

542
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,600
But he's not in a coma anymore.
And he is disoriented.

543
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,780
No, he's not.

544
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:21,522
We have a rather large piece
of tempered glass that begs to differ.

545
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:23,961
I just mean it's not connected.

546
00:27:24,357 --> 00:27:25,401
You don't know that.

547
00:27:25,815 --> 00:27:26,761
Yeah, I do.

548
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:29,403
- How could you possibly know--
- Because I did it.

549
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:36,022
I didn't think he should
be discharged, so I

550
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,030
gave him three grams of phenytoin.

551
00:27:39,496 --> 00:27:41,212
I wasn't gonna just let him leave.

552
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:43,682
But you were okay with him
crashing through a glass wall?

553
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:46,510
I tried to keep him in the wheelchair,
but he's tough to stop.

554
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:47,681
Nice audible, Peyton.

555
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:51,131
So what do we do now?

556
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:54,020
Discharge report says
he didn't eat his breakfast.

557
00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:57,262
Humpty Dumpty didn't get to
be the size of all the King's horses

558
00:27:57,268 --> 00:27:59,242
by skipping the most
important meal of the day.

559
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:01,993
What causes coma,
fever, and loss of appetite?

560
00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:04,450
It can't be Chagas.
He's never been outside the country.

561
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:05,502
But his stomach has.

562
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:08,040
The food we eat no longer
comes from America's heartland.

563
00:28:08,047 --> 00:28:10,743
It comes from South America's
deforested jungle land

564
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:13,412
where lettuce now grows
and lettuce pickers now poop.

565
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:15,793
Get a sample of his
CSF before the little bugs

566
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:18,123
that are now feasting on
his brain move on to dessert.

567
00:28:18,126 --> 00:28:19,421
How are we gonna do that?

568
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:21,243
He's too big to do an LP.

569
00:28:22,227 --> 00:28:23,721
So go straight to the source.

570
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,741
You want to drill a hole in my head?

571
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:29,912
It's the only way.

572
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:32,832
It's got to be something
other than a parasite.

573
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:37,450
I buy my produce at the best
market in town. And I always wash it.

574
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:39,632
Leafy vegetables can
suck contaminated water

575
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,290
through their roots
right into the plant.

576
00:28:41,297 --> 00:28:44,952
You could've washed them in chlorine
and it still wouldn't have mattered.

577
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:47,012
Then other people would be sick as well.

578
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:50,043
Parasites could've
been on only a few items.

579
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:52,233
Or maybe they just didn't
eat as much as you did.

580
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:54,291
It's always about my weight, isn't it?

581
00:28:55,155 --> 00:28:57,751
Why can't you people
come up with one theory--

582
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:59,223
Because this one fits, George.

583
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:02,912
It explains your coma,
your fever, your loss of appetite.

584
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:09,433
And the...

585
00:29:10,136 --> 00:29:11,161
disorientation?

586
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:13,391
It's all explained.

587
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:16,142
And if we don't treat it
while it's still in the acute stage,

588
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:17,110
it'll be too late.

589
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:20,552
It could go on to infect your heart,
intestines, esophagus...

590
00:29:27,005 --> 00:29:28,852
This is what I get for eating salad.

591
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:37,610
Suction.

592
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:39,970
Aspirator.

593
00:29:49,338 --> 00:29:50,282
Your turn.

594
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:53,831
Irrigation.

595
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:56,100
Sponge.

596
00:29:56,525 --> 00:29:59,321
- What-- What did you do?
- Nothing. Why, what's wrong?

597
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:01,030
I can't see.

598
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:02,613
Your vision's blurry or you've lost it?

599
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:04,460
I didn't lose it! You took it from me!

600
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:06,263
- George, calm down. - I can't see!

601
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:07,522
Give me some lorazepam!

602
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:09,851
- What did you do to me! - Hold still!

603
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:11,853
You're gonna rip your head on the halo!

604
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,951
There's no inflammation in the
optic nerve, and his retina's intact.

605
00:30:16,956 --> 00:30:19,582
The blindness has to have been
caused by something in his brain.

606
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:21,651
And, not surprisingly,
there was no sign of Chagas

607
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:23,400
or any other parasites in his CSF.

608
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:27,172
So we ruled out his parents,
prostitutes, the arugula.

609
00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:29,892
- Means either--
- I took the sample from the prefrontal.

610
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,893
I was never anywhere
near his visual cortex.

611
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:36,071
- Or you missed a tumor on the MRI.
- Not a chance. The MRI was clean.

612
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:37,493
You mind?

613
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,031
- Where are you going?
- To get a $400 butt plug.

614
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:42,931
- What about George?
- He's gonna have to get his own.

615
00:30:43,117 --> 00:30:44,061
Come on, let's see

616
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:47,011
if we can get this thing figured
out by the time we get to the elevator.

617
00:30:47,017 --> 00:30:47,961
It could be MS.

618
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:50,123
It would explain the coma,
the blindness,

619
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:51,433
loss of balance, and the fever.

620
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,621
Could also explain his
lack of concern for his health.

621
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:56,542
- MS can cause excessive cheerfulness.
- Yeah, he's a delight.

622
00:30:56,545 --> 00:30:59,012
You don't get to MS with
coma as the first symptom.

623
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:00,760
Blindness plus coma says diabetes.

624
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:02,992
- Just in time. - No--

625
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:05,691
Blood sugar, urine dipstick,
and hemoglobin A1-C are normal.

626
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:07,140
Were normal when you tested.

627
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,493
He's been in and out of a coma.

628
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:10,131
Whatever's going on
is waxing and waning,

629
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:13,733
unlike his pant size, which only waxes.
Which also points to diabetes.

630
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:17,283
Test him again. This time,
add a glucose tolerance test and an HEC.

631
00:31:17,346 --> 00:31:18,842
We already have a CSF sample.

632
00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:21,732
We might as well check it
for proteins and rule out MS first.

633
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:24,280
Agreed, except for the
part about doing it first.

634
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:25,340
Where are you going?

635
00:31:25,347 --> 00:31:28,002
The butt plug was my way
of saying mind your own business.

636
00:31:28,008 --> 00:31:29,150
Apparently too subtle.

637
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,603
George, all it is is sugar water.
I promise.

638
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:35,652
Just because I'm overweight
doesn't make me diabetic.

639
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:37,671
You tested me. Everybody's tested me.

640
00:31:37,787 --> 00:31:39,683
Sometimes the blood sugar
levels can fluctuate,

641
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:41,080
make it difficult to diagnose.

642
00:31:41,085 --> 00:31:44,420
You stuck a needle in my brain
and ten seconds later I was blind!

643
00:31:44,425 --> 00:31:46,173
How's that difficult to diagnose?!

644
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,691
Who the hell knows what
else you guys have done to me!

645
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,920
- I should've never come here!
- You didn't come here.

646
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:53,722
You were brought here because
you were in a coma and barely alive.

647
00:31:53,726 --> 00:31:57,072
We didn't do that to you.
You need to let us figure out what did.

648
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,461
For someone who insists
he enjoys life as much as you do,

649
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:04,352
you certainly don't seem
willing to do much to prolong it.

650
00:32:04,385 --> 00:32:07,573
Yeah, because I don't agree
with the brilliant doctors,

651
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:09,541
suddenly I'm suicidal.

652
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,020
Refusing to cooperate with
us does not make you suicidal.

653
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:13,173
It makes you an idiot.

654
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:15,891
You think we want to
see you blind or in a coma?

655
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:20,831
I've been fat all my life.

656
00:32:22,178 --> 00:32:24,402
I've only been sick
for the past few days.

657
00:32:26,568 --> 00:32:30,952
You look for a disease that has nothing
to do with my size, and I will help you.

658
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:34,062
Otherwise,

659
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:36,280
leave me alone.

660
00:32:39,568 --> 00:32:40,510
Speeding,

661
00:32:41,895 --> 00:32:42,840
DUI,

662
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:44,450
reckless driving,

663
00:32:44,987 --> 00:32:45,932
resisting arrest,

664
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:48,351
possession of a Class Three narcotic--

665
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:51,001
Now it looks like they've
added another possession

666
00:32:51,006 --> 00:32:53,000
with intent to traffic charges as well.

667
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:57,122
They found some pills at your house.

668
00:32:57,126 --> 00:32:59,070
All of which I had a prescription for.

669
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,812
- That's a lot of pills.
- I'm in a lot of pain.

670
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:03,791
This is all because some...

671
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:06,852
cop came into the clinic.
I was rude to him.

672
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:08,753
This is his way of getting back at me.

673
00:33:08,757 --> 00:33:09,883
You've made it pretty easy.

674
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:12,351
His insane reaction to a simple

675
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:14,283
rectal thermometer reading

676
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:18,000
probably says a lot more about
his mother than it says about me.

677
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,603
I'm inclined to think
your particular charm...

678
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:26,332
may not be immediately
appreciated by a jury.

679
00:33:26,758 --> 00:33:28,523
I'm not interested in a plea bargain.

680
00:33:28,526 --> 00:33:30,570
It's your best bet to make this go away.

681
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:33,072
There is no "this." There's a "him."

682
00:33:33,977 --> 00:33:36,733
The only thing I'm guilty
of is humiliating a bully.

683
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:38,631
I wasn't speeding. I wasn't impaired.

684
00:33:38,636 --> 00:33:41,442
I didn't resist. And I certainly
was not distributing narcotics

685
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:44,142
to anyone but myself because
I need those narcotics.

686
00:33:45,318 --> 00:33:46,361
Five grand retainer.

687
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:50,453
If we end up going to trial, it'll be
another thirty due before the first day.

688
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:51,770
My hourly is $450.

689
00:33:52,626 --> 00:33:53,573
That work for you?

690
00:33:58,257 --> 00:33:59,551
What did your lawyer say?

691
00:34:00,947 --> 00:34:03,662
I looked up "butt plug" in
a legal dictionary. What did he say?

692
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:05,502
That a smile like mine can't lose.

693
00:34:06,896 --> 00:34:08,963
- What did the tests say?
- You're right about MS.

694
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:10,811
No myelin basic proteins in his CSF.

695
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:11,761
What about diabetes?

696
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:14,431
Don't know. He says we only think
it's that because of his weight.

697
00:34:14,438 --> 00:34:15,582
Won't let us test him.

698
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:35,492
So, you would rather be a blind
invalid than admit the fact that maybe

699
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:37,791
you might have a little
problem with overeating.

700
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:40,842
By a little problem, of course, I mean
you've eaten yourself half to death.

701
00:34:40,857 --> 00:34:43,161
And you would rather let
me die than consider the fact

702
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:46,461
that whatever is wrong with
me has nothing to do with my weight.

703
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,513
I go where the symptoms tell me to go.

704
00:34:49,136 --> 00:34:52,033
Right now, they're asking why this
stuff is the first thing you've ever

705
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:54,912
- refused to swallow.
- I am not diabetic.

706
00:34:55,355 --> 00:34:58,903
Grocery stores giving away medical
degrees with the free turkeys now?

707
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:00,163
The sooner you drink this,

708
00:35:00,168 --> 00:35:02,562
the sooner I get to go waste
my time with something else.

709
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,811
Get the hell off of me!

710
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:05,932
No dessert until you finish your dinner.

711
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:09,612
- Help me!
- George, just drink it.

712
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:10,643
Nurse!

713
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:13,453
Get this jackass off of me!

714
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,041
What the hell is going on?

715
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,040
Just trying to force a horse to--

716
00:35:19,188 --> 00:35:20,132
Let go.

717
00:35:41,945 --> 00:35:42,890
What's going on?

718
00:35:43,438 --> 00:35:44,683
Get X-rays of his hands.

719
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:49,371
Then bronc him, do a sputum cytology and
check his CSF for anti-Hu antibodies.

720
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,630
How are we gonna get him to do all that?
We can't even get him to drink a bottle.

721
00:35:52,636 --> 00:35:55,263
Tell him that lung cancer
is in no way connected to obesity.

722
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:57,463
You don't think he'll
realize we're lying?

723
00:35:57,595 --> 00:35:59,480
You're not. Lung cancer's got nothing--

724
00:35:59,488 --> 00:36:03,132
- I meant about him having lung cancer.
- You didn't notice his fingers?

725
00:36:04,238 --> 00:36:06,772
- I noticed they were fat.
- You should've pissed him off.

726
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:09,040
He would've grabbed you.
And you would've felt the bones.

727
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:10,991
They're not just fat, they're clubbed.

728
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:45,410
George?

729
00:36:48,095 --> 00:36:49,040
It's me.

730
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:55,102
Your tests were positive.

731
00:36:57,157 --> 00:36:59,053
You have a small cell lung carcinoma.

732
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:02,090
It caused a paraneoplastic
neurologic syndrome,

733
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:04,443
which in turn caused
your blindness and coma.

734
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:07,851
The cancer's metastasized
to your lymph nodes.

735
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:12,570
It's inoperable. But there
are radiation treatments available.

736
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:18,291
It might give you a few more months.

737
00:37:23,095 --> 00:37:24,072
I never smoked.

738
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:39,571
C'est la vie.

739
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:17,871
You were right.

740
00:38:20,188 --> 00:38:21,081
So was he.

741
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:22,332
He said, "C'est la vie."

742
00:38:22,796 --> 00:38:23,990
He's a complicated man.

743
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,282
What about you?

744
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:28,200
What are you gonna
do about your problem?

745
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:30,153
Nothing. Just got a call from my lawyer.

746
00:38:30,155 --> 00:38:32,351
He gave the DA copies
of my prescriptions.

747
00:38:32,428 --> 00:38:34,282
As soon as they confirm
they're bona fides,

748
00:38:34,286 --> 00:38:37,151
they're gonna drop the possession,
DUI, and resisting arrest.

749
00:38:37,158 --> 00:38:40,093
As soon as I pay my $85 speeding
ticket and the impound fine,

750
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:42,343
- I get my bike back.
- I guess that's good.

751
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:43,923
- You guess? - No, it's good.

752
00:38:46,795 --> 00:38:49,041
You get to keep going
like you always have.

753
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:52,923
All right, I give up.

754
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:55,780
Who was it? Who in your
family had the weight problem?

755
00:38:55,787 --> 00:38:57,450
You think I can only
care about a patient

756
00:38:57,455 --> 00:38:59,731
if I know someone else who's
been through the same thing?

757
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:03,260
You care for everybody. You only
lie and stand up to Cuddy for a few.

758
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:05,531
You lie for everybody
and only care about a few.

759
00:39:05,536 --> 00:39:07,032
You're avoiding the question.

760
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:08,892
I like damaged people, remember?

761
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,340
Explains everything I do.

762
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:13,012
Almost everything.

763
00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:17,061
Wasn't you, was it?

764
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:20,791
- Does it matter?
- No, but it'd be interesting.

765
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:24,440
Sorry to disappoint you. Sometimes
the answers just aren't that simple.

766
00:39:30,528 --> 00:39:31,972
I know he can be a real ass.

767
00:39:32,377 --> 00:39:34,822
And he has no problem
lying when it serves him.

768
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:37,871
But he's not lying about the pain.
He needs the medication,

769
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,412
which is why I prescribed it.

770
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:40,870
All of it.

771
00:39:40,965 --> 00:39:41,912
I see

772
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:43,702
a lot of cases where

773
00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:46,941
people who have real injuries

774
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:49,023
end up getting addicted.

775
00:39:50,795 --> 00:39:51,740
And then, well...

776
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:53,573
Things kind of

777
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:55,480
spiral out of control.

778
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:58,352
And lives get ruined.
And not just their own.

779
00:40:02,558 --> 00:40:04,550
Uh, I don't know what else to tell you.

780
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,161
- What about these? - This is getting--

781
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:21,561
If it's got my name on it,
it's a legit scrip.

782
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:22,562
- You sure? - Yeah.

783
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:25,493
Because the signatures on these

784
00:40:25,865 --> 00:40:28,611
look a little different
than the signatures on those.

785
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,953
- You look surprised. - No, I'm just--

786
00:40:41,828 --> 00:40:45,023
I haven't thought about it.
I do sign my name differently sometimes.

787
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:52,493
- Are you sure? - Yeah,

788
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,460
I just-- I guess I get
bored signing it the same way.

789
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:58,062
You know what they say
about doctors' handwriting.

790
00:40:58,756 --> 00:40:59,700
I'm gonna give you

791
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:02,143
a moment...

792
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:04,272
to reconsider

793
00:41:05,366 --> 00:41:06,310
that answer.

794
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:08,303
Because if you are,

795
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:09,740
for some reason,

796
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:11,182
mistaken...

797
00:41:13,456 --> 00:41:14,481
we will find out.

798
00:41:15,658 --> 00:41:17,400
And that will not be good for you.

799
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:19,682
Or Dr. House.

800
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:23,972
I am sure. Absolutely.

801
00:41:28,188 --> 00:41:29,133
All right.

802
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,320
I guess that's it then.

803
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,083
- Thank you for your help.
- Okay, no problem.
