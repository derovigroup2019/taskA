1
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:16,527
All right, stand here.

2
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,089
You're just tall enough.

3
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,680
I- I don't-

4
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:26,343
I don't think I am.

5
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,565
It just goes around. There's
nothing to be scared of, all right?

6
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,214
I didn't say I was scared.

7
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:35,226
It'll be fun. Come on. When I was a kid,
this was my favorite thing ever.

8
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,636
I don't like rides.

9
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:39,591
All right, all right.

10
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:44,150
I just-I thought it'd be fun.
I shouldn't be making you do this.

11
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:47,976
Let's go home. We can have fun at home.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,997
No, Daddy, wait.

13
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,529
The ride does look like fun.

14
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:11,263
Oh, this is awesome!

15
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:31,131
Alice, are you all right?

16
00:01:33,137 --> 00:01:34,231
Honey, you all right?

17
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:36,921
Alice!

18
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:38,282
Alice, are you okay?

19
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:46,403
Transcript: FRM - Synchro: jh26

20
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:13,702
Nothing happened.

21
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:15,062
Something happened.

22
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,561
It was a little kiddie ride.

23
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:19,371
She hates those rides. I don't
understand why you insist on making-

24
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:21,831
Okay, I appreciate the
fullness of your answers, but

25
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:25,483
I just wanted to know if she
had any history of abdominal problems.

26
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:26,431
- No.
- No.

27
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:29,931
The admitting doctor
noted no family history of-

28
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:31,951
I have an aunt with Crohn's Disease.

29
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:33,322
You didn't mention that?

30
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:37,052
I forgot what it was called. Your aunt
has got a million things wrong with her.

31
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,653
If you paid attention for five minutes-

32
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,942
I doubt it's Crohn's.
She has none of the other symptoms.

33
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:43,620
You're alone with her for eight hours,
she ends up in the hospital.

34
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:47,273
I'm wondering if we can focus on
answering the questions, Mrs. Hartmann.

35
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,310
I'm not Mrs. Hartmann. We're divorced.

36
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:52,530
I suspected.

37
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:57,111
And your past generosity
made me think of you.

38
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,111
We're half a million
dollars from our goal.

39
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:03,161
Of course, this is a naming
opportunity for your foundation.

40
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,050
Is-is there a problem?

41
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:11,613
There's something on your face.

42
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:15,960
It's, uh-

43
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:21,652
Excuse me.

44
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:30,741
I'm sitting in there
hoping it's a sniper

45
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:33,752
because at least then the
sociopath isn't my employee.

46
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:37,210
This baby won me second
place in the clinic's weekly

47
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,710
"weirdest thing pulled
out of an orifice" contest.

48
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:42,501
I am this close to putting
a new lab in Oncology.

49
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:45,151
You do not want to
know what came in first.

50
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:47,162
- House.
- Rhymes with "fucchini."

51
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:48,992
Give me his pills.

52
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,700
- Where's my prescription?
- No more free floating prescriptions.

53
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:00,350
Princeton PD has already
forced Wilson to shut down.

54
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:03,360
A cop says boo, Wilson shuts down.

55
00:04:03,556 --> 00:04:07,890
Every doctor in this place is afraid
to make a move without covering his ass.

56
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:10,761
Do you think maybe you're
shouting at the wrong person?

57
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,852
Tritter's obviously out to get me.
He doesn't care-

58
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:15,013
- Your forged prescriptions!
- Allegedly.

59
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:18,360
Your pain has become my pain.

60
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:21,653
From now on you get reasonable
doses at reasonable times.

61
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,522
But I hurt in an unreasonable way.

62
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:26,480
- Then dip into your secret stash.
- Tritter took it.

63
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,810
Then move onto your secret secret stash.

64
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:29,540
I ran out.

65
00:04:29,546 --> 00:04:31,940
Then move onto your
secret secret secret stash.

66
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:45,900
Parents say she's not on any med.

67
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:48,952
If the pancreatitis wasn't set
off by drugs, and she hasn't been sick,

68
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,653
that leaves trauma or
some kind of structural defect.

69
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:52,643
Put up the CT.

70
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:58,582
- What's that density there?
- Shadow. Looks normal to me.

71
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:01,633
- We got a referral from-
- Excuse me.

72
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:08,381
You stash your drugs
in a Lupus textbook.

73
00:05:08,787 --> 00:05:09,731
It's never Lupus.

74
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:12,522
Who's got gallstones,
and why do we care?

75
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:14,661
- Gallstones?
- Biliary duct is dilated.

76
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:16,701
Probably from a stone lodged in it.

77
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,643
Must've caused a nasty
case of pancreatitis.

78
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:20,931
She's six.
Six-year-olds don't get gallstones.

79
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:22,580
So she didn't have pancreatitis.

80
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:24,571
Your theory is an invisible gallstone?

81
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:27,293
His theory correctly
predicted pancreatitis.

82
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,002
You might want to wait until
he actually tells us his theory

83
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:32,011
before you start kissing
his theory's ass.

84
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:33,210
My theory is...

85
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:35,570
vanishing gallstone.

86
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:39,352
She had it, and it passed.
Those things travel in packs.

87
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:42,620
The rest of them are probably hiding out
in her gall bladder. Do an ultrasound.

88
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:46,072
If I'm right, we'll take out
the organ so we can analyze the stones.

89
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:55,232
I wasn't kissing his ass.

90
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:58,712
It must've just looked that way from
our angle. You on your knees,

91
00:05:58,727 --> 00:05:59,593
House bending over.

92
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,071
He predicted the pancreatitis.

93
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,613
- It's his dad's fault.
- My dad was an ass.

94
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:06,073
But you did everything he wanted you to,
and in return

95
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:09,013
- you got everything you wanted.
- Yeah, it's that simple.

96
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,062
The strategy worked.

97
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:13,062
Dad got him a cushy job.
Paid for his cushy life.

98
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:15,052
Cut me out of his cushy will.

99
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:17,243
I told you.

100
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:19,101
It's just his nature.

101
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:21,073
Poor guy's hardwired to kiss ass.

102
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:22,371
House was right.

103
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:23,951
Gallstones.

104
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:28,591
I didn't know a kid
could get gallstones.

105
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:31,762
It's unusual. That's why
we need to see what's causing it.

106
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:35,140
We'd like to remove Alice's
gallbladder and analyze the stones.

107
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,143
- Sure.
- No.

108
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,652
- Just 'cause I said sure?
- I am capable of my own thoughts.

109
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:40,973
It's a simple procedure.
The gallbladder isn't essential-

110
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:43,153
If the doctor thinks we should do it,
we should, Edie.

111
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:45,111
You think maybe we
should get a second opinion

112
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:46,962
before we start removing
our child's organs?

113
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:01,141
That's an effective
use of taxpayers' money.

114
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,282
I'm actually off this week.

115
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,763
I'm guessing you don't have a family.

116
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:09,333
Most people have enough going on
in their lives that they don't have

117
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:10,731
to personalize every slight.

118
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:11,881
This isn't personal.

119
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:13,812
Not anymore.

120
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:16,122
My head of oncology had to shut down.

121
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:20,212
My entire staff are afraid to
make a move without covering their ass.

122
00:07:20,497 --> 00:07:22,592
I think you're angry
at the wrong person.

123
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:26,823
You think Dr. Wilson deserved
to have his assets seized?

124
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,813
- His entire practice ruined?
- No.

125
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:32,160
So you just don't care?

126
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:36,951
This is how I get what I want.

127
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,350
I put pressure on people.

128
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,682
And if it doesn't work on Wilson,

129
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,080
it'll work on you.

130
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:47,103
You punish the innocent.

131
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:49,210
None of you are innocent.

132
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:51,043
Not one of you.

133
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:55,170
Not one of you has told me the truth.
about Dr. House.

134
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:57,871
The pills allow him
to cope with the pain.

135
00:07:57,997 --> 00:08:01,683
No, the pills distort reality.

136
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:02,843
He is an addict.

137
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:05,910
He's not out robbing a liquor store or-

138
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:07,272
No, he's treating people.

139
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:12,301
He needs to find a different
way to cope before he kills somebody.

140
00:08:12,948 --> 00:08:14,543
If he hasn't done that already.

141
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:17,390
If you're right,
he has a medical problem.

142
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:20,500
It should be dealt
with by doctors, not by-

143
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:24,630
Well, it's not being dealt with
by doctors. Doctors are covering it up.

144
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:29,696
The whole point of
the criminal justice system

145
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,537
is to make things right
when everything else fails.

146
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:36,119
With all due respect...

147
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:39,411
you have failed.

148
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:54,231
Sorry. Didn't know you
wanted your kid dead. Although,

149
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,413
for a couple of G's I
could still make it happen.

150
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,641
- Who the hell are you?
- I am complete stranger

151
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:02,342
who apparently cares more about
whether your kid dies than you do.

152
00:09:02,348 --> 00:09:04,843
- You're Dr. House.
- You've seen my stage show.

153
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,263
She's not dying. She has pancreatitis.

154
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:09,721
Once you've treated that,
I'm taking her home.

155
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:11,180
And do what, burn sage?

156
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:12,651
I want you to do the surgery.

157
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:15,160
My father had gallstones.
They were totally harmless.

158
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:18,191
Alice had one bad one, but it passed.
For all we know this is over.

159
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,403
And for all we know she
could get sick again tomorrow.

160
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:23,203
Then I'll take her to her pediatrician.
She's six, Rob.

161
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,373
She shouldn't have unnecessary surgery.

162
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:27,630
Or a moron for a mom,
but what can you do?

163
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:31,522
You're the doctor. I'm the mother.

164
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,211
I outrank you. Live with t.

165
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:42,502
I've read the file.
You've got 15 minutes.

166
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,243
It's like people like
this who killed Copernicus.

167
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:47,052
- Galileo.
- Either way.

168
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:49,010
And they just locked Galileo up.

169
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,830
They killed his spirit.
Nobody likes a showoff.

170
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:55,080
Luckily, Alice Hartmann has
a dad who's willing to see reason.

171
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:57,901
Reason as defined by
slavishly deferring to you.

172
00:09:58,185 --> 00:09:59,083
Their doctor.

173
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:01,923
Your Honor, I've had no
opportunity to consult my attorney.

174
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:02,893
There's no time.

175
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:05,771
- All I want is a second opinion before
- No time!

176
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:08,962
Your testimony is their child will die

177
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,472
if I don't grant this motion right now.

178
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:12,531
Am I under oath?

179
00:10:12,868 --> 00:10:13,870
Let's say yes.

180
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:16,851
My testimony is that
this child might

181
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,693
die if you don't grant
this motion right now.

182
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:20,690
Literally no time for a second opinion.

183
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:22,400
Wouldn't be as good
as the first opinion.

184
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:25,611
- Dr. Cuddy, what do you think?
- She's not a specialist in this area.

185
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:26,911
Her opinion is worthless.

186
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:29,390
Dr. Cuddy,
what do you think of Dr. House?

187
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,421
Is he as big a jerk as I think he is?

188
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:33,903
Bigger.

189
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:36,503
But he knows what he's talking about.

190
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:06,512
Got a page.

191
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:08,111
She's complaining about her stitches.

192
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,281
Nurse just said that's
completely normal. Did you get

193
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:12,530
- the test results for the gallstones?
- Any minute now.

194
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,903
No time for a second opinion
but the test takes three-

195
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:15,853
My skin hurts.

196
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:19,793
I know I no longer have
the right to demand it,

197
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:21,791
- but could you please take a look?
- Sure.

198
00:11:21,795 --> 00:11:24,271
She's pissed, now she's just
looking for things to go wrong.

199
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:28,191
You're right, I'm so petty I hope
she dies so it vindicates my opinion.

200
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:34,783
I didn't mean that, sweetie.
Mommy was being sarcastic.

201
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,750
She's a few years away from
grasping sarcasm, don't you think?

202
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:38,703
Guys.

203
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:51,882
I already gave you that number.

204
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:55,481
Simple surgical procedure turns
a little girl into The English Patient.

205
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:56,433
What gives?

206
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:58,792
Must be allergic to something
we used in the surgery.

207
00:11:58,796 --> 00:11:59,742
C ameron.

208
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:02,151
C- a-m-e-r-o-n.

209
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:06,311
This is my office. I'm talking.
There are people here who work for me.

210
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,050
They're not listening.
Explain this to me.

211
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:09,352
Tritter froze my account.

212
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:12,561
They're checking theirs.
I'm on hold with a lawyer.

213
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:16,370
Call Wilson's lawyer. He'll tell
you exactly how and why you're screwed.

214
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:18,093
This kid has no history of allergies.

215
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:20,571
You've gotta talk to Tritter.
You gotta make this go away.

216
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:23,301
Yeah, great plan.
The man's obviously open to reason.

217
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:25,381
Well, here's the plan. We do nothing.

218
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:28,330
We wile away the time
diagnosing the patient.

219
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:31,321
The stones were calcium bilirubinante,
pigment stones.

220
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:32,803
Which are non-conclusive.

221
00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:36,071
Kid presented with low-grade fever,
mild anemia.

222
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,752
That plus the stones
indicate bacterial infection.

223
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,380
Bacterial infections
don't cause a vesicular rash.

224
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:45,861
And doing nothing is not a plan.
It's specifically a lack of a plan.

225
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:48,921
We cut into her belly. Bad boys escape.

226
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:53,170
They swarm over, colonize the wounds,
and... ka-plow! Vesicular rash.

227
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:56,682
Allergic reaction is 100% more
likely with or without a history.

228
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:59,570
Fever and anemia could've
been symptoms of pancreatitis.

229
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:01,263
Hello?

230
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:03,880
Thank you for your help.

231
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:06,290
They froze my accounts.

232
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:08,802
- Thank you for your help?
- It's not her fault.

233
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:10,793
He hasn't gotten to mine yet.

234
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:14,451
I'm gonna withdraw and much as
I can as fast as I can. Lunch is on me.

235
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:17,132
Do a scratch test. Check for allergies.

236
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:20,552
When it comes up negative,
start broad-spectrum antibiotics.

237
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:25,840
Bullies bully. They don't
get a reaction, they lose interest.

238
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:30,252
No go do what I ask before
I stick your heads in toilets.

239
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:40,622
- How'd Otter get here?
- Daddy got him last night.

240
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:43,922
It was at the dry cleaner.
They close at 6:00. How'd you get it?

241
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:47,540
I drove over there. I knocked
for about ten minutes. And then I

242
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:49,391
I begged.

243
00:13:57,805 --> 00:13:59,831
How about some ice cream
for when this is through?

244
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,350
- My tummy hurts.
- Ginger ale?

245
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:05,050
Yeah?

246
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,892
- I'll take over.
- Be right back.

247
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,801
He's already been really good at
the big romantic gestures, but ask him

248
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:21,882
to do the dishes or show
up for a meal on time or drive her-

249
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:22,942
Almost done here.

250
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,922
- What are you doing here?
- I work here.

251
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:46,372
Passively-aggressively
you gave up your practice.

252
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,423
I have clinic hours.

253
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:50,462
Now, you're passively-aggressively
spreading peanut butter

254
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:52,213
with a big sign around your neck saying,

255
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:54,623
"Wilson doesn't have enough
cash for the cafeteria."

256
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,433
You know, before Lenny
Bruce died of a drug overdose...

257
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:02,193
If you're gonna confront me
with everyone who ever abused narcotics,

258
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:04,173
I think I'm gonna have
to get something to read.

259
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:05,872
...he was arrested
on obscenity charges.

260
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:07,823
He went through a series
of arrests and trials

261
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:09,981
because he just couldn't
stop challenging the police.

262
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:12,562
He became obsessed with
his own legal problem.

263
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:17,062
And his act turned into long,
humorless rants about fascist cops

264
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:18,703
and the violation of his rights.

265
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:21,451
I get it, I get it.
I need to change my nightclub act.

266
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:22,590
You think more props?

267
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:26,071
House, scratch test is getting results.
A lot of results.

268
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:45,901
How could she be allergic to everything?

269
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:47,060
She can't be.

270
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:49,603
It has to be an infection.

271
00:15:49,888 --> 00:15:52,823
You see a positive allergy
test and decide it's infection?

272
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,271
The bacteria got into
the scratches in her back.

273
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:57,750
Infections radiate.
That shape of this isn't-

274
00:15:57,878 --> 00:15:59,922
- Eat this.
- I don't feel like eating.

275
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:02,032
- It'll make you better.
- A sandwich?

276
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:04,062
- Magic sandwich.
- There's no such thing-

277
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,763
Just take a damn bite, okay, kid?

278
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,211
Amazing how she didn't
go into anaphylactic shock.

279
00:16:27,306 --> 00:16:29,001
That's diagnostically ridiculous.

280
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:31,373
Right, she's allergic
to everything except peanuts.

281
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:35,023
If she is allergic, antibiotics
could cause a massive systemic reaction.

282
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:37,151
If she's allergic, but she's not.

283
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:43,010
Chase, you're right. The shape indicates
allergy. The tests indicate allergy.

284
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:44,921
Just because she's
not allergic to peanuts

285
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:46,900
doesn't mean she's not
allergic to lidoca?ne or-

286
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:51,100
Chase, hang the bag!
You can grow a backbone tomorrow.

287
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:54,260
No, I'm not giving my daughter
drugs that could shut her system down.

288
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,211
You know what else shuts down systems?

289
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:57,870
Death.

290
00:16:58,657 --> 00:16:59,601
Sorry.

291
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:01,421
I can't let you do this.

292
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:08,081
Luckily, Alice Hartmann has a mom

293
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:10,412
who is willing to see reason.

294
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:12,172
You were in here yesterday

295
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:14,921
telling me her father's
guardianship was best for her.

296
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:18,322
I honestly figured I'd
get a different judge today.

297
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:22,740
- You agree with Dr. House now.
- Now my kid actually is sick.

298
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:25,151
- She was sick yesterday.
- Her pediatrician doesn't know

299
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:27,002
what's wrong with her,
says House is the best.

300
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,930
She loses guardianship.
Then, House is a hero.

301
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:32,761
- It's got nothing to do with me deci-
- Hey, zip it! I've heard enough.

302
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,263
- This lawyering thing is easy.
- You shut up too.

303
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:39,383
Arguing over every decision
is a waste of her time and mine.

304
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:43,491
Since her parents can't or won't agree,

305
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:47,750
I'm awarding temporary
guardianship to a doctor

306
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:51,871
who will place the health
of the child above all else.

307
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,421
I don't think Dr. House is capable-

308
00:17:53,426 --> 00:17:54,893
- Dr. Cuddy.
- Yes, Your Honor.

309
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:56,871
No, I was finishing my sentence.

310
00:17:58,567 --> 00:17:59,751
The kid's all yours.

311
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:04,552
3:00. Give me the pills.

312
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:08,312
I don't even know this kid. How am I
supposed to decide what's best for her?

313
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:11,542
Fine, I'll choose. I'm gonna
side with the angry doctor's opinion.

314
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,501
Give me my pills.

315
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:15,832
We're not gonna go broad-spectrum. If
there's any chance that she's allergic-

316
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:17,693
- There is no chance.
- Of course there's one.

317
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,373
- I'm appealing.
- No, you're not.

318
00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:21,593
If you think it's bacterial,
pick one antibiotic.

319
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:23,620
Not gonna be enough.
We need to go broad-spectrum.

320
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,303
It kills bugs. That's what you want.

321
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:28,032
We'll go with metronidazole.

322
00:18:32,397 --> 00:18:34,791
You don't have to testify
he's broken any laws.

323
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:36,912
Though I'm sure you could.

324
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,353
Just how many pills he takes in a day.

325
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:42,752
Because I'm fairly confident
I can prove that he didn't, uh,

326
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:46,453
have that many legitimate prescriptions.

327
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:50,442
I really hope no one dies while
I'm sitting here not talking to you.

328
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,363
I- I had a, uh-

329
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:57,830
I had a buddy at Trenton PD

330
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,552
do some digging.

331
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:03,043
Your brother locked up for drugs.

332
00:19:03,786 --> 00:19:05,082
Your own flesh and blood,

333
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,141
and you don't even visit.

334
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:10,301
But your boss practices
medicine on drugs,

335
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:14,150
time to start lying to the cops.

336
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:18,262
If I run out for coffee, will
I get back before you make your point?

337
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:21,360
You, um, you testify...

338
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:26,113
I can make sure that
Marcus goes free on parole

339
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:29,460
in less than two months.

340
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:33,903
My brother and I...

341
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:37,842
We grew up in the same home.

342
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:41,353
But...

343
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:44,172
I made something of myself.

344
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:46,722
He didn't.

345
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:48,781
Dr. Foreman, the way you talk,

346
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:52,521
you'd think you never
committed any crimes yourself.

347
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:57,781
You and Dr.
House. You are both cold bastards.

348
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:00,511
You don't give a
damn about your brother,

349
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:02,300
and you can't stand House.

350
00:20:05,346 --> 00:20:09,441
But I do expect you to take this deal

351
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:13,061
because you hate hypocrisy more.

352
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:16,372
House has had a thousand chances.

353
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:17,673
You had two chances.

354
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,212
Why is your brother stuck at one?

355
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:30,310
Well, if she was allergic to this
antibiotic, we would've seen it by now.

356
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,222
I think we are out of
the woods as far as that goes.

357
00:20:34,758 --> 00:20:36,700
Guess they occasionally get one right.

358
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:39,451
You're gonna be glib about this?

359
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,693
- You almost killed her.
- I made a choice.

360
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:44,641
The same choice you made yesterday.
Only when I make it, I'm an imbecile.

361
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:46,551
Every decision you
have made has been wrong.

362
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:48,572
When this over,
I'm suing for sole custody.

363
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,711
Because I trusted
doctors when you didn't?

364
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:53,180
Because it's not just
about the past two days.

365
00:20:53,437 --> 00:20:56,211
Like you have the hotline on
what's best for Alice. She loves me.

366
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:59,293
She never does her homework when she's
with you. She never brushes her hair-

367
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:02,492
Her heart's racing. Pressure's rising.
The two of you, get out.

368
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:05,571
I'm her mother. You can't just-

369
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:07,952
You fight. She has an anxiety attack.

370
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,760
The two of you are making her worse.

371
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:13,002
Get out and don't come back.

372
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,241
How's the kid doing?

373
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:23,231
Much better as of about two hours ago.

374
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:24,853
You got any money for lunch?

375
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,663
If you like parsley and croutons.

376
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,880
Tritter finally froze my accounts.

377
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:30,283
- Really?
- You surprised?

378
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:31,261
Why wouldn't he?

379
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:34,570
I figured if he was singling you out,
you must've done something different.

380
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:35,571
What, like talking?

381
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:38,820
Yeah, and now that he's frozen
your accounts, you probably will.

382
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,360
You need the cash, right?

383
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:42,153
He doesn't freeze my accounts,
I'm guilty.

384
00:21:42,156 --> 00:21:44,151
He does freeze my accounts, I'm guilty.

385
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:46,531
Is Alice having some procedure done?

386
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:48,530
- She's fine. She's resting.
- Where?

387
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:50,093
In her room,
where you're not supposed

388
00:21:50,097 --> 00:21:52,151
I was just at the window.
There's no one in there.

389
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:53,853
Her backpack wasn't there either.

390
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:56,191
You don't think her father could've-

391
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:57,142
Call security.

392
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:10,441
- Get a gurney.
- She's stiff. She can't move.

393
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:13,472
I don't know what happened.
I mean, she seemed fine.

394
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:16,692
Help her, please.

395
00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:25,912
On the plus side,
she could medal in luge.

396
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:28,910
Muscle rigidity is almost
exclusively neurological.

397
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,312
Neuroaxonal dystrophy.
She's the right age.

398
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:34,220
Except that her liver's starting
to shut down. No dystrophy would-

399
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,871
M etronidazole.
Great idea. Let's not go broad-spectrum.

400
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:40,253
Let's not take any chances
of actually curing her.

401
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:41,800
House, can you focus on the case?

402
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:43,532
No! Because I'm in pain.

403
00:22:43,725 --> 00:22:46,213
Because you think that compromise
is the answer to everything.

404
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:47,290
I need more pills.

405
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:50,023
Muscle rigidity plus liver
involvement means Wilson's.

406
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:52,333
No, no corneal ring. No mental changes.

407
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:53,553
Then what?

408
00:22:58,006 --> 00:22:59,292
I need more pills!

409
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:03,160
- No, you are on a reasonable-
- What the hell does "reasonable" mean?

410
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:09,223
Keep it quiet.

411
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:12,900
Her B.P. reacts to stress,
and yelling is not gonna-

412
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:16,571
If you think that I'm not in pain,

413
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:19,351
then don't give me anything.
Keep me away from the aspirin.

414
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:22,073
But If I'm in a buttload of pain,
I need a buttload of pills.

415
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:25,133
Fine. You need more pills.
You're not getting them.

416
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:27,211
You can have all the aspirin you want.

417
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:37,612
I say we draw straws.
Loser drives down to Trenton,

418
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:39,323
scores him an eight-ball.

419
00:23:42,426 --> 00:23:44,403
- Which one of you gave her an aspirin?
- What?

420
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:45,881
Her symptoms fit Reye's Syndrome,

421
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:48,582
which doesn't make any
sense unless she took aspirin.

422
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:49,153
Rob?

423
00:23:49,157 --> 00:23:51,462
No way. She's a kid.
I've read the 800 warning labels.

424
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:53,550
I'm not even angry.
I just want her to be okay.

425
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:56,292
She's lying. She's angry.
Because you kidnapped her kid.

426
00:23:56,298 --> 00:23:58,041
She'll be angrier if the kid dies.

427
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,580
- I didn't.
- One aspirin

428
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:02,243
combined with a pre-existing
infection is all it takes

429
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:03,941
- to set off an attack.
- I'm not lying.

430
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:06,291
Well, sure,
you've certainly earned our trust.

431
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:08,720
Where was Alice the
night before she came in?

432
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:12,442
With me. Well, at my house. I went out.
She stayed with a babysitter.

433
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:14,373
- Where were you?
- None of your business.

434
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,573
You hired someone that
might've poisoned our daughter.

435
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:21,092
- She's 15. She's very responsible.
- Is she a 15-year-old pharmacist?

436
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:24,323
Or just some kid from down the
street who needed 20 bucks for lip gloss

437
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:25,673
and couple of Tiger Beats?

438
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:30,060
Put your kid on charcoal hemoperfusion.

439
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:31,982
Shouldn't we see what
the babysitter has to say?

440
00:24:31,986 --> 00:24:34,723
I know what she's gonna say.
She's gonna lie to save her business.

441
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:35,670
I need more pills.

442
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:46,262
We are gonna use this
machine to clean your blood.

443
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:49,863
It goes out of you and through
a filter like the filter in a fish tank.

444
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:52,870
It's kind of cool actually.

445
00:24:58,367 --> 00:24:59,311
I'm scared.

446
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:04,580
It won't hurt.

447
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:06,871
It takes a while,

448
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,403
so it'll be boring.

449
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:09,602
But it won't hurt.

450
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,772
It's gonna make you better.

451
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:17,280
They hate each other, don't they?

452
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:20,063
We're never gonna be together again.

453
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:24,270
Well, you never know.

454
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:36,581
You gonna break out the rubber hoses,
the bright lights?

455
00:25:36,597 --> 00:25:39,550
I'm not gonna testify just
because I have to borrow lunch money.

456
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:40,461
I know.

457
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:42,042
Women don't give up guys that

458
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:44,080
they're in love with.

459
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:46,080
I'm not in love with House.

460
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,452
The guy is unhinged and unethical.

461
00:25:49,897 --> 00:25:52,242
Does what he wants
with no concern for others.

462
00:25:52,445 --> 00:25:53,540
But you stand by him.

463
00:25:54,057 --> 00:25:55,952
It can't just be loyalty and respect.

464
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:57,563
No.

465
00:25:57,568 --> 00:25:59,713
I'm a girl,
so I must be in love with him.

466
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:01,493
Not because you're a girl.

467
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,602
Because ten years ago

468
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:08,360
you got an "A" in calculus
until you ratted yourself out.

469
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,561
Showed your professor
a mistake he missed.

470
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:16,920
- Because you married a man-
- Don't go there.

471
00:26:18,157 --> 00:26:20,650
You used to be someone
who did the right thing.

472
00:26:23,238 --> 00:26:24,381
House has changed you.

473
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,732
Do you think it's
all been for the better?

474
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:41,780
How's it going?

475
00:26:41,898 --> 00:26:43,492
- Boring.
- Told you.

476
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:47,102
So far, so good. Just like five
minutes ago, ten minutes before that.

477
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:48,792
What's the matter?

478
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:57,173
She must've thrown a clot.

479
00:26:57,178 --> 00:26:59,473
Let's get her out of here.
I'll call the O.R.

480
00:27:00,388 --> 00:27:01,731
You said it wouldn't hurt!

481
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:14,193
- Found it.
- She's burning up.

482
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:16,382
- Give me a sec.
- Foreman, she is on fire.

483
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,822
- Almost there.
- Get me some cooling blankets now.

484
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:19,770
Right away.

485
00:27:20,127 --> 00:27:22,191
Every time we touch this kid,
something goes wrong.

486
00:27:22,197 --> 00:27:24,002
Bad mojo is not a diagnosis.

487
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:28,002
You really had to flash
your private stash in front of me?

488
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:31,722
You find it easier to
lie for me if it's more subtle?

489
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:32,970
Fine.

490
00:27:37,896 --> 00:27:41,493
Your told your associates
that I had frozen your accounts.

491
00:27:42,137 --> 00:27:43,590
- Yes.
- Smart lie.

492
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:48,573
You figured they'd think there was
a reason that you'd been singled out.

493
00:27:48,578 --> 00:27:49,522
Like that

494
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:52,520
you had agreed to testify against House.

495
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,783
Yeah, I assume that's why you did it.

496
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:58,131
You have a reputation

497
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:00,901
as a bit of an opportunist.

498
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:03,431
You already gave your boss
up once from what I've heard.

499
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:06,450
To save my job.
He goes down now, I lose my job.

500
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:09,580
You lose your job, you fin another one.
You get fired...

501
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:12,991
Chances don't look so hot.

502
00:28:13,337 --> 00:28:16,080
- Why would he fire to me?
- Because you rolled on him.

503
00:28:16,086 --> 00:28:18,480
- I haven't rolled on him.
- I think you will.

504
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,770
And he's gonna think you already did.

505
00:28:20,776 --> 00:28:25,153
As far as he knows, my accounts
are frozen just like everyone else's.

506
00:28:25,295 --> 00:28:29,071
In 24 hours, all three of you
will have access to your accounts again.

507
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:30,682
- Why would you-
- See,

508
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:32,762
if I was looking at this

509
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:35,630
as an outsider,

510
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:37,352
I would say

511
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,363
it was because Detective Tritter had

512
00:28:40,747 --> 00:28:43,700
what appeared to be a very
pleasant lunch with Dr. Chase.

513
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:53,383
Yeah.

514
00:28:56,407 --> 00:28:57,353
The two of them

515
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,263
appeared to be

516
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,721
working together.

517
00:29:07,258 --> 00:29:09,621
How the hell are there
no ice packs in the O.R.?

518
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,831
Clot's out. Ice packs aren't gonna hold
her for long. Where are the blankets?

519
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:15,630
In the E.R., they're dealing
with a four-car collision.

520
00:29:15,658 --> 00:29:18,350
We need to cool this kid
down before her brain melts.

521
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:23,693
What are you doing?

522
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:28,743
She got a major dose of heparin
to thin her blood for the procedure.

523
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:30,473
Could've induced thrombocytopenia.

524
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:34,033
That's unlikely. The charcoal
would've absorbed a lot of the heparin.

525
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:35,591
She's been anemic.

526
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:39,851
- Could be a primary blood disorder.
- Or we never cured the infection.

527
00:29:39,857 --> 00:29:41,613
Are you saying she never had Reye's?

528
00:29:41,617 --> 00:29:43,841
We just put that little
girl through excruciating pain.

529
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,393
The pain wasn't House's fault.
Even if the clot was a reaction

530
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:50,091
- to what we gave her we still had-
- I don't need you to cover my ass!

531
00:29:50,568 --> 00:29:51,912
What I need is my Vicodin!

532
00:29:52,276 --> 00:29:55,153
Two pills every six hours.
Like I'm on an allowance.

533
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:58,362
She's a given a cop leverage
over medical decisions.

534
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:01,860
What the hell? Why don't we
get a plumber in here, ask his opinion?

535
00:30:02,335 --> 00:30:05,180
Hey, Cuddy, you know any
rodeo clowns who can weigh in-

536
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:11,282
Where the hell is she?

537
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:18,683
Look at her arm.

538
00:30:20,968 --> 00:30:23,582
- I told you it was an infection.
- We fixed the infection.

539
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,213
Well, apparently not.
I asked you for broad-spectrum.

540
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,871
You put her on the bare minimum.

541
00:30:27,968 --> 00:30:31,412
It's a good thing you failed
to become a mom because you suck at it.

542
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,820
What's good about this rash?

543
00:30:55,017 --> 00:30:56,391
Good guesses, but no.

544
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:00,461
It's on parts of her
body that we haven't touched.

545
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:03,733
She's got a fever of 103.
She's in and out of consciousness.

546
00:31:04,305 --> 00:31:07,952
But it's not a reaction to anything
we did. Her mojo is off the table.

547
00:31:08,315 --> 00:31:09,260
Which means?

548
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:13,092
Oh, so close!

549
00:31:14,477 --> 00:31:17,292
Means that thanks to
Cuddy's candy-ass approach

550
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:19,961
broad-spectrum antibiotics
are no longer an option.

551
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:22,883
This thing has grown horns and fangs.

552
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:27,573
We gotta figure out what species it is.
Go in with a spear to the heart.

553
00:31:31,075 --> 00:31:32,472
Okay, you guys are sulking.

554
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:36,771
I don't really care why, but apparently
I can't do my job without finding out.

555
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:40,633
- Tritter released our bank accounts.
- Horrible, horrible news.

556
00:31:41,437 --> 00:31:43,430
Wow, I'm glad we didn't let that fester.

557
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,743
If she did have Reye's, then it
could be varicella. They're associated.

558
00:31:46,746 --> 00:31:49,341
He released our money.
You do know what that means.

559
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:51,200
The correct question is

560
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:54,261
"how could it be varicella
given that she's not itchy?"

561
00:31:54,268 --> 00:31:56,591
Rickettisal pox causes rash,
fever, and muscle pain.

562
00:31:56,596 --> 00:31:59,832
Pain, not paralysis. Rocky Mountain
spotted fever on the other hand.

563
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,490
Rash, fever, anemia, paralysis.

564
00:32:01,726 --> 00:32:04,483
- And I didn't say anything to Tritter.
- Neither did I.

565
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:07,040
Maybe he wants us to
think that one of us talked.

566
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,961
- It worked.
- You were with him.

567
00:32:08,966 --> 00:32:11,811
- We were all with him.
- We weren't laughing with him.

568
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:13,020
Maybe he just gave up.

569
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,690
Start the kid on chloramphenicol
for Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

570
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:21,863
- Can we talk?
- Nope.

571
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,450
- I really think-
- Either you screwed me

572
00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:27,381
and you want absolution,
or you didn't and you want applause.

573
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:28,931
Either way I'm not interested.

574
00:32:42,146 --> 00:32:43,091
Busy.

575
00:32:47,385 --> 00:32:48,333
You okay?

576
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:49,643
Yeah, sure.

577
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:52,090
What I meant by "are you okay?" is

578
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:54,090
what the hell did House do?

579
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:55,691
- Nothing.
- What did he say?

580
00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:59,903
I've seen House be rude a thousand
times, usually to achieve something.

581
00:33:00,085 --> 00:33:03,693
I have never seen him
be mean just because he can.

582
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:05,201
Seriously?

583
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:11,180
- What did he say?
- Nothing. Doesn't matter.

584
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,203
Well, I've seen House be
rude to you a thousand times,

585
00:33:14,418 --> 00:33:15,972
but I've never seen it get to you.

586
00:33:15,975 --> 00:33:16,920
People think

587
00:33:17,648 --> 00:33:19,873
House has no inner censor.

588
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,483
But the fact is he holds himself back,

589
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:24,531
because when he wants to hurt, he knows

590
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:26,691
just where to poke a sharp stick.

591
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:33,672
I have been trying to get pregnant,
and House knew.

592
00:33:34,538 --> 00:33:36,381
He told me I would fail as a mother.

593
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:40,923
And you're this upset
because you think he's right?

594
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,841
I've had three separate implantations.
The first two never took.

595
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,983
The last one I lost.

596
00:33:49,387 --> 00:33:50,332
I'm sorry.

597
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:51,803
You didn't fail.

598
00:33:52,538 --> 00:33:53,981
Those where physical events.

599
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,400
A little girl is...

600
00:33:57,747 --> 00:33:59,552
scared and in pain.

601
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:05,411
I was awkward,
terrified of doing the wrong thing.

602
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:08,443
- That's normal. That's-
- I didn't hug her.

603
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:13,130
I didn't even reach out and hold her
hand. I told her it was gonna be okay.

604
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:14,871
She needed reassurance.

605
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:17,302
I told her her folks
might get back together.

606
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:25,941
When I see people with their kids,
it's so natural.

607
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,933
It's like they have an instruction
book imprinted on their genes.

608
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:31,533
Maybe I just didn't get a copy.

609
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:34,451
Maybe my wanting
to be a mother is like a

610
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:38,792
tone deaf person wanting to sing
opera or a paraplegic who wants to-

611
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:46,510
Well, I see what you mean
about House poking in the right spot.

612
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:14,063
Chloramphenicol isn't working.

613
00:35:18,168 --> 00:35:21,311
- What dose did you give her?
- Yeah, maybe Chase screwed up.

614
00:35:23,095 --> 00:35:25,640
We always end up there.
Just getting a jump on it.

615
00:35:26,196 --> 00:35:27,142
I doubled her up.

616
00:35:28,728 --> 00:35:30,193
The infection's morphed.

617
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:34,810
- It's moved into her muscle sheath.
- Necrotizing faciitis?

618
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:37,140
That's impervious to drugs.

619
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,021
The only treatment...

620
00:35:39,636 --> 00:35:41,382
is to cut away the infected area.

621
00:35:43,078 --> 00:35:45,460
- So we amputate.
- Arm and leg?

622
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:49,621
We can't cut a six-year-old kid
in half without a confirmed diagnosis.

623
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:54,033
Moves too quickly and we waited too
long. We don't have time for a culture.

624
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:58,060
We can at least observe her for a few
hours. Confirm the rash is spreading.

625
00:35:58,065 --> 00:35:59,911
It spreads, she dies.

626
00:36:00,315 --> 00:36:02,391
You're talking about crippling her.

627
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:04,461
We're not even certain
this was an infection.

628
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:09,123
Right! She's six! She's cute!
She can't have flesh-eating bacteria!

629
00:36:09,675 --> 00:36:10,753
It's just wrong!

630
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:13,170
Let's cure her with
sunshine and puppies.

631
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:17,161
Cute kids die of terrible illnesses.
Innocent doctors go to jail.

632
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:20,972
And it because cowards like you
won't stand up and do what's required.

633
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,123
You can sit around and moan
about who's the bigger weakling.

634
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,461
I'm gonna go do my job.

635
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:47,730
What kind of quality of
life will she have without-

636
00:36:47,736 --> 00:36:48,930
Great thing about life.

637
00:36:49,865 --> 00:36:50,911
It's got qualities.

638
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:53,911
And if we can't agree?

639
00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:57,631
I don't know.

640
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:01,842
He's yelled at us before.

641
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,972
Because he thought our theories
were dumb. Not because our theories

642
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:07,393
- were sending him to jail.
- He's going through withdrawal.

643
00:38:07,405 --> 00:38:08,881
Could be causing mild paranoia.

644
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,922
It'll pass,
we just have to suffer thought it.

645
00:38:10,928 --> 00:38:12,191
We never ruled out allergy.

646
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:14,162
We gave her drugs.
She had no negative reaction.

647
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:16,320
We cut open her belly.
She got a rash on her belly.

648
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:19,001
We did a scratch test on her back.
She got a rash on her back.

649
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,692
I know House ruled out mojo,
but it can't be a coincidence-

650
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,340
Too late to be playing
differential games, isn't it?

651
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:26,741
Get that thing away from me.
I don't want to get burned.

652
00:38:26,758 --> 00:38:28,751
Laser pointers don't burn you, genius.

653
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,610
- Skin, no. Retina, yes.
- You don't trust my aim?

654
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:33,613
Maybe you should cover any sensitive-

655
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:40,003
He was wrong about the puppies.

656
00:38:45,395 --> 00:38:46,340
House,

657
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:49,871
you gotta stop the surgery.
She doesn't have necrotizing faciitis.

658
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:50,683
Oh, good.

659
00:38:50,685 --> 00:38:54,090
She's got erythropoietic protoporphyria.
She's allergic to light.

660
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,190
It's genetic,
either parent could've carried it.

661
00:38:56,196 --> 00:38:58,430
I know what it is.
Infection fits better.

662
00:38:58,438 --> 00:39:01,401
She gets worse every time
she goes under surgical lights.

663
00:39:01,587 --> 00:39:03,933
- Dad takes her outside-
- Liver's shot too.

664
00:39:04,356 --> 00:39:06,803
- She swallow a flashlight?
- Stop the surgery.

665
00:39:07,018 --> 00:39:09,162
- Get the hell out of my way.
- No, I'm-

666
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:17,612
Light damages the blood cells.

667
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,683
The damaged blood cells
contain protoporphyrin.

668
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:23,143
The protoporphyrin
builds up in the liver.

669
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:26,803
That's why the liver's shutting down.

670
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:55,532
Stop.

671
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:04,523
How can she be allergic to light?
She's never had this problem before.

672
00:40:04,525 --> 00:40:06,471
The negative reaction starts at birth.

673
00:40:07,015 --> 00:40:09,111
It reaches critical
mass around this age.

674
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:13,350
Her blood cells create
chemicals in reaction to light.

675
00:40:13,905 --> 00:40:17,301
When they reach the liver,
it tries to filter out the bad cells.

676
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:19,691
The chemicals damage the liver,

677
00:40:20,278 --> 00:40:22,110
and one byproduct is gallstones.

678
00:40:23,407 --> 00:40:25,151
So she'll just keep getting worse?

679
00:40:25,877 --> 00:40:27,493
EP can be managed.

680
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,822
We'll give her beta-carotene.
She's gonna need special light bulbs

681
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:34,082
and filters on the windows. She's
probably gonna need to be home schooled.

682
00:40:34,088 --> 00:40:35,581
Her life will be complicated,

683
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:37,523
but she will live.

684
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:40,090
How do you get something like this?

685
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:42,113
- It's genetic.
- So one of us...

686
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:48,920
Both of you must be carriers.

687
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,771
She's gonna want to see
you when she wakes up. So...

688
00:40:57,197 --> 00:40:58,143
don't screw it up.

689
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:28,233
So, what's new?

690
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:33,810
- House missed one.
- That's happened before.

691
00:41:33,818 --> 00:41:35,410
He nearly maimed a little girl.

692
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:37,681
I got it right.

693
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:40,601
And I told him, and it didn't matter.

694
00:41:44,256 --> 00:41:47,692
Chase, you solved one. You helped a
patient. That better be enough for you.

695
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:50,501
Beckett was gonna call his
play "Waiting for House's Approval" but

696
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,753
decided it was too grim.

697
00:41:51,996 --> 00:41:52,941
Trust me.

698
00:41:54,037 --> 00:41:55,280
I'm not waiting anymore.

699
00:42:36,796 --> 00:42:38,960
I'm gonna need 30 pieces of silver.

700
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:49,460
