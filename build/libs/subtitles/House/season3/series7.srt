1
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,870
What are you doing down here?

2
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,110
I thought you usually
had lunch with coma guy.

3
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,070
This is vegetative state guy.
Better company.

4
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,550
Hey, tell him about those sherpas
you dropped acid within st.Patrick's cathedral.

5
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,140
You stole my prescription pad,
and you forged my name.

6
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,800
- What did you tell the cop?
- I lied.

7
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,390
They'd have put you away for ten years.

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,650
After they took your license
to practice medicine.

9
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,190
- So everything's good, then.
- I lied to the cops.

10
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,850
There is no case unless they can prove that either
I gotthe drugs illegally or I sold them illegally.

11
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,110
I didn't do the second.
You lied about the first. Game over.

12
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,850
Yeah.
Tritter's just playing.

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,550
He's gonna seehow clever you are
and then just walk away.

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,490
The important thing is that you keep
prescribing the same amount of drugs to me,

15
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,960
or it'll look suspicious.

16
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,100
Here's another way to look at it.

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,740
Having forced me to lie to the police,
your first concern is securing your drug connection.

18
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,460
Joining my father for lunch?

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,360
I should've called ahead for a table.

20
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,640
- Dr. House was just--
- enjoying a reuben.

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,160
It's okay.

22
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,080
After ten years, anything that'll
get doctorsin the same room as--

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,510
- what are you doing?
- Nothing.

24
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,890
What are you doing?

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,040
Chips?

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,650
Wanna see something really cool?

27
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,820
I saw you leaving last tuesday.

28
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,740
Practically tripped over two guys on your way out,
but you had no problem opening doors.

29
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,780
It's called akinetopsia.

30
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,760
You can't see things when they move.

31
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,310
And since you haven't been hit by a bus,
I assume that it's intermittent.

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,140
It's probably accompaniedby seizures,which made me
think that I could set one off by flashing them

33
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,070
god, I love this family!

37
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,930
I can see fine now.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,770
I've had seizures before.

39
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,460
Most of the time, they're small.

40
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,570
Doctors ran me through all the tests.

41
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,140
Couldn't find anything.

42
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,410
Any history of epilepsy in your family?

43
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,530
The only things I know that
run in my family are a lot of chutzpah

44
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,680
and the ability to sleep for ten years.

45
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,300
Although i'm not really an expert.

46
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,930
Dad never really liked my mother's side of the family,
and after she died and he came here,

47
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,200
I was raised by a guardian.

48
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,690
I wouldn't even know
how to get in touch with him.

49
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,420
How 'bout your father's side of the family?

50
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,850
Any relatives we could speak with?

51
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,570
My father was an only child.

52
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,990
And my grandparents are dead.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,110
Well, who did you put down as the person
the hospital should contact in an emergency?

54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,960
- I left it blank.
- there's gotta be someone.A friend?

55
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,090
Oh, plenty of friends.
Just...

56
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,310
no one that would care if I was here.

57
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,980
Say, do you mind passing me my backpack?

58
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,690
Hair of the dog.

59
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,250
- could be infection.
- or a brain tumor.

60
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,200
Says he had a ct.

61
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,580
What's wrong with the
simplest explanation?Trauma.

62
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,910
He didn't report any injuries.

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,060
He didn't report
being an alcoholic, either.

64
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,480
Drinking equals falling down,
equals trauma, equals

65
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,930
maybe it's inherited.

66
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,860
How would you jump to
genetics from his eeg?

67
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,450
All you've got are some
vaguely epileptiform waves.

68
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,670
It's not his eeg.
It's his father'S.

69
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,830
When it comes to cortical seizures,
like father, like son.

70
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,900
Small seizures aren't unheard of
in a patient in a vegetative state.

71
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,560
Similarities are interesting, though.

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,130
What caused the vegetative state?

73
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,130
His house burned down.

74
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,660
Went back into get his wife.

75
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,530
Firefighters found him unconscious
three feet from the bedroom, asphyxiated.

76
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,280
Not an inherited condition.

77
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,110
Test his dna.

78
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,630
Start with a drenomyeloneuropathy.

79
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,240
Check out the home.

80
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,060
- He has a single bed.
- They still make single beds?

81
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,480
Could mean he just doesn't have sex--
though there were condoms in the apartment.

82
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,240
House asked you to check out the home for toxins.

83
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,940
No mold, no leaks, no pets.

84
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,140
mri and lp are both inconclusive.
Infection's still possible.

85
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,770
- Tumor's less likely, but--
- dna?

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,210
Adrenomyeloneuropathy test was negative.

87
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,760
Dna test again.Try unverricht-lundborg
and late-onset lafora'S.

88
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,390
genetic tests take forever.

89
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,290
You can't just keep testing for every
inherited condition you think it might be.

90
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,090
Well, not me.I'll be leaving early.
But you guys can.

91
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,070
You said no one's been sick,
but what about delivery people,repair guy?

92
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,010
I wouldn't know.
I work from home.

93
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,970
Haven't been to the office
in over a month.

94
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,430
- visitors?
- Haven't had any.

95
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,790
The only person I've seen in the last week
was the pizza delivery guy.

96
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,330
And he looked pretty healthy.

97
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,720
There's gotta be someone you're close to.

98
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,550
Actually, the person I see most oftenis my father.

99
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:16,580
He's asleep,so he can't stop me.

100
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,870
- What is it?
- Just feeling a little nauseous.

101
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,130
- I--I think his liver's failing.
- Oh, god.

102
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,560
Does--does that mean that I'm--

103
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,700
I need a central line kit.
Two units of packed red blood cells,type o negative.

104
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,090
He's unconscious and heading for a coma.

105
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,400
He's at a four on the rlas scale.

106
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,540
Stop all treatment.

107
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,060
You think this is a reaction to our meds?

108
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,320
Well, they're obviously not helping.

109
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,360
Given the fact that he's an alcoholic,there's a good chance
his liver wasn't so hot when he came in.

110
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,810
Anti-seizure drugs could have
just pushed him over the edge.

111
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,270
We take him off those meds,
what do we put him on?

112
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,740
I was hoping you'd know.

113
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,130
May be academic,
but I just started him on dialysis.

114
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,310
Kidney and liver failure.

115
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,940
Not too many people
come back from that.

116
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,150
trauma's out of the picture.
It could still be infection.

117
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,220
- Or neurological.
- Or genetic.

118
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,990
We needa better history.

119
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,510
did you miss the part
where the patient lost consciousness?

120
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,520
L-dopa?

121
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,730
You're not waking kyle.

122
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,870
You're waking his father.

123
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,020
I commend your observational skills.

124
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,520
You have no reason to think any amount
of drugs will wake a man from a coma.

125
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,420
Vegetative state.
Much easier.

126
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,740
This guy's no terry schiavo.

127
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,270
His brain's all there.He moves around.
His muscles have barely atrophied.

128
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,500
Just waitingfor a fairytale kiss.

129
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,730
After I do that,
stick a needle in him.

130
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,190
The amount of amphetamines alone
would be dangerous,

131
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,430
besides whatever the hell else
you've got in there.

132
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,610
There are reports out of south africa

133
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,090
about a pill that would temporarily revive
someone in a vegetative state.

134
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,510
We've all seen awakenings.
Made me cry.

135
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,880
I wanna cry.

136
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,550
put the syringe down.

137
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,220
I can out-draw you, mysterious stranger.

138
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,460
We don't experiment on helpless patients.

139
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,900
Be reasonable.
There's no way this is gonna work.

140
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,590
Even if you woke him,
it would only be for a few hours.

141
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,030
A day, two at the most.
You're risking his life.

142
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,880
I'm risking getting sued.
That's the only objection here.

143
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,670
You'll be torturing him.
And his family.

144
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,040
Good news for legal.
The only family he's gotis upstairs dying.

145
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,210
Hey!

146
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,180
I want this patient monitored
for the next 24 hours.

147
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,350
I want someonewith him at all times
to make sure you didn't kill him.

148
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,410
I want your ass in my office--

149
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,000
god.I'm starving.

150
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,230
I could really go for a steak.

151
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,590
do you know your name?

152
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,470
You know where you are?

153
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,120
Gabriel wozniak.
I don't know the name of this hospital.

154
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,370
- How much are three and five?
- Eight.

155
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:21,030
Also known as 1/2 of 16,1/4 of 32,
two to the third power.

156
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,300
Coolest thing ever.

157
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,450
- Any history of seizurein your family?
- No.

158
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,530
- Liver disease?
- No.

159
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,220
How long have I been here?

160
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,930
I--I got the feeling it's,
um,been a long time.

161
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,940
interesting.If your internal clock
kept ticking,how deep does that awareness go?

162
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,460
Pick up scraps of conversations?

163
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,950
You have the vague sense that the hospital
administrator dresses like a trollop?

164
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,390
Or that the new star wars movies
were a disappointment?

165
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,220
I know my wife is dead.

166
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,520
I don't know how longit's been.

167
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,220
Ten years.

168
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,070
What's the last thingyou remember?

169
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,440
The fire.

170
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,350
My wife was in the bedroom.
She had takena sleeping pill.I got...

171
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,600
kyle out.
Went back in for her.

172
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,200
- I knew I didn't make it.
- I'm sorry.

173
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,030
What about your wife's side of the family?
Any history of seizures there?

174
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,190
Your son kyleis a patient here.

175
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,600
I'm afraid his conditionis serious.

176
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,560
He may be dying.

177
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,000
No seizure issues on my wife's side, either.

178
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,820
What about that steak?
Nobody ever answered me.

179
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,980
Rumor in the cafeteria was
caustic guy was waking up coma guy.

180
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,270
Technically,vegetative state guy
was woken by...

181
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,310
- yeah, caustic guy.
- So what happened?

182
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,550
Gotta get him a steak before I can
ask himany more questions.

183
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,040
He doesn't want to talkabout his son?

184
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,980
Didn't seem to emotionally register
that his son is sick.

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,920
Brain issue? He was asphyxiated,
spent ten years as asparagus.

186
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,130
- Who knows what damageis in there?
- It's possible.

187
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,310
'Course, there's alwaysthe simple explanation.

188
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,270
Maybe he just doesn't like his son.

189
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,790
Only in your world would that be simple.

190
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,390
The delusion that fathering a child
installs a permanent geyser of unconditional love--

191
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,600
maybe your father's feelings
were conditional.Not everyone's--

192
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,570
yes, well, of course,that would play
into yourromantic vision of human--

193
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,390
in terms you would understand,we have an
evolutionary incentiveto sacrifice for our offspring.

194
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,310
Our tribe,our friends.
Keep them safe.

195
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,010
Except for all the people who don'T.

196
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,500
Everything is conditional.

197
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,080
You just can't always anticipate the conditions.

198
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,530
Mind if we talk for a few minutes?

199
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,950
How many pills would you say
dr. House takes a day?

200
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,500
I'm uncomfortable setting a number.

201
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,530
Mm, try.

202
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,730
Six.

203
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,350
A day.

204
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,840
Has he ever had you...

205
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,900
write prescriptions for him?

206
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,230
No.What is ityou want me to say?

207
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,600
That he takes too many pills
and is a danger to the hospital?

208
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,600
Or he takes too few
because he's selling them on the side?

209
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,900
Either one is ridiculous.

210
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,370
- I meant the former.
- You're wrong.

211
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,030
Can I ask whatdr. House has done
to deserve your loyalty?

212
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,300
He's not knownas a great boss.
He's not even much of a friend.

213
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,430
I mean, look how he left
dr. Wilson holding the bag.

214
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,180
It's odd.
You don't know about that.

215
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,820
You defend him, and he won't even
tell you what's happening in his life.

216
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,970
- I was paged.
- Saw you with a cop.

217
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,790
What'd he want?

218
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:22,280
How many pills does house take,did I
ever write him a prescription,that sort of stuff.

219
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,390
- I told him six.
- A day,or in a mouthful?

220
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,120
I was just hoping you guys
would stay consistent with--

221
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,300
- he wants to talkto us, too?
- You're next.

222
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,990
We've gotta tell house what's going on.

223
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,930
- Tritter says no.
- Then no it is.

224
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,050
Cops have a thousand ways
to make life difficult for you.

225
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,380
Quick, what's the kid's status?

226
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,750
I gotta get back to our sleeper
before he goes looking for the orgasmatron.

227
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,440
See, if that were rhetorical,

228
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,130
it would mean that I could just turn around
and leave now.Which I'm not doing.

229
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,020
From which you should deduce--

230
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,470
he's off all drugs except the antibiotics.

231
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,470
His liver's just managing to hang in there.

232
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,140
He's still sliding into coma.

233
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,510
Your barber sucks.

234
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,390
Hey.

235
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,810
Coma diet.
I could makea fortune.

236
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,700
Vegetative state diet.

237
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,470
- Who gave you your clothes?
- Dr. Cuddy.

238
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,100
I guess I'll needall new ones anyway.
Everything went in the fire.

239
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,600
Ah, don't worry about it.

240
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,620
We use recyclable clothes now.
Wear them once, then eat them.

241
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,080
Your son's measles vaccination.

242
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,810
Do you remember if he had it
and what type it was?

243
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,120
Man, you're a piece of work,you know that?

244
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,030
You weren't gonna tell me,were you?

245
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,030
I don't need new clothes.
Dr. Cuddy says my body will adjust to the drugs.

246
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,310
That I'll be a vegetable againby tomorrow.

247
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,120
If I'm really lucky,the day after.

248
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,640
Yeah.

249
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,870
If I got a day to live,I'm not gonna spend it
in a hospital roombeing grilled.

250
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,410
come on, where you gonna go?

251
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,680
Your house burned down.Your wife's dead.
Business was sold off.

252
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,350
The only thing you have left
is down the hall heading for a liver biopsy.

253
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,850
Used to be this little,
um,hole in the wall.

254
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,970
Run by a guy named gian carlo.

255
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,230
Made the best hoagies in the world.

256
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,400
Real italian rolls.
Prosciutto. Provolone.

257
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,440
How far is atlantic city from here?

258
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,960
You have one day to live.
And you want a sandwich.

259
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,990
- People on death row get a last meal.
- State provides it.

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,830
Who's providing for you?
You got a car? Money?

261
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,150
You're negotiating with me.

262
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,320
Take out another hundred for me.

263
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,870
And I need your car.

264
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,610
I'm not doing you any favors.

265
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,190
You'll get it back tomorrow.
Two days, max.
Road trip.

266
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,370
This is like trying to control the weather,
but I'd prefer it if you didn't eat in the car.

267
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,610
- I just had it detailed.
- I drive.

268
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,010
- Oh, the hell he does.
- Sure.

269
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,900
Aside from the fact he just woke upfrom a
vegetative state,the guy doesn't have a licensE.

270
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,680
How 'bout this?
Cops stop us, we lie.

271
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,550
You know how to do that.
Chips.

272
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,140
It's all the drugs
pumping through his system.

273
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,880
Right now, his reflexes
are better than dale earn hardt jr.'S.

274
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,220
Hey, what's this?
It says, "ipp-odd."

275
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,010
I'm coming.

276
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,930
so let's talk about toxic exposure.

277
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,380
what was wrong with the old colors?
I trusted brown.

278
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,570
Do the purple ones
have chocolate inside?

279
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,660
Raspberry cocaine.

280
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,010
This house that burned down.
Where was it?

281
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,490
Moorestown, new jersey.

282
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,230
Listen, I really need to know about the candy
because I'm allergicto berries.

283
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,740
- You didn't mention that.
- Is it significant?

284
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,910
No.

285
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,210
So where else did you live?
List everywhere,including vacations.

286
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,050
Start with when your wife got pregnant.

287
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,610
We lived in jersey.
Then we moved to jersey.From there, jersey.

288
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,510
What are you waiting to hear?

289
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,080
About the little cottage in the amazon
with the mosquitoes and the lead paint all over the walls?

290
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,430
Yes.

291
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,030
You know what?

292
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,250
I didn't let you come along so you could
suck all the fun out of my one day of life.

293
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,330
Well, you're outta luck,
'cause that's totally why I'm here.

294
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,270
Okay.
Rule change.

295
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,560
Person with the money makes the rules.

296
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,600
Or in this case,the person who's friends
with the person with the money makes the rules.

297
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,600
Well, you want answers
more than I want money.

298
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,230
All right, so here's the game.
Ask whatever you want.

299
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,000
But for every question I answer,
you have to answer one first.

300
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,280
And why would you care about
anything I have to say?

301
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,050
The day before I died,
I was a successful man.

302
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,670
I had a factory with over 200 employees.

303
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,640
People listened when I talked.
I liked power.

304
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:19,690
Now the only power I have left
is the power to annoy you.

305
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,600
Took wilson's assistant for coffee.

306
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,290
- Why?
- Something tritter said.

307
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:35,820
She told me the police think that house stole
wilson's prescription pad and forged his name.

308
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,480
You...believe it?

309
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,240
- Do you?
- Oh, absolutely.I do.

310
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm just checking
how naive you are.

311
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,610
He's not gonna steal his best friend's pad,j
eopardize his career.

312
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,010
Until his best friend says no to him.

313
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,100
house is a junkie.

314
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,360
Junkies do whatever they
have to do to get what they need.

315
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,630
Kyle's down to a three on the rlas scale.

316
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,230
He's only showing localized response.

317
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,490
I'll call house.
Tell him we're gonna need an answer soon.

318
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:11,540
Get in your right lane for 295.
And pass me the twizzlers.

319
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,680
- I'm curious.
- No, you're not.

320
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,480
Why would a man's first instinct be
to drive away from the only family he's got?

321
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,910
No!This is no time for you to do your thing.

322
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,260
We don't care about his state of mind.
We don't care if he's happy.

323
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,300
This factory of yours.
What did you make?

324
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,140
- So ask me a question.
- I'm thinking.

325
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,860
Only six left, by the way.

326
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,620
So sign my name.
You don't need a doctor.You need a pen.

327
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,940
What is upwith you two?

328
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,290
Wilson lied to the bulls
to keep me out of the big house.

329
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,310
- Are you out of your mind?
- Well, who's he gonna tell?

330
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,920
By tomorrow night,he's gonna
bea mindless stalk of celery.

331
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,630
Since I answered that one,
by the way,my turn.

332
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,040
- What did you make in your factory?
- Luxury boats.

333
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,270
- Have you ever been in love?
- Wow.

334
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,450
Going right for the closets
with the embarrassing stuff.

335
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,190
Good move.Yes.
Describe the boats.

336
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:12,950
35- to 65-foot hulls.Twin engines,parquet floors
in the galleys,staterooms with queen beds.

337
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,790
- How'd you meet?
- She shot me.

338
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,210
These boats.I assume you used
mildew-resistant painton the hulls?

339
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,710
Naturally.
Shot you?

340
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,960
Paintball.
Doctors versus lawyers.

341
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,070
- You ever take your son to the factory?
- Sure.

342
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,810
He used to run all over the place,
but it was perfectly safe.

343
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,460
Ever love anybody else?

344
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,940
No more questions.
I got my answer.

345
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,740
While dad's in the office,
son's watching them spray-paint.

346
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,500
And what kid wears a mask?

347
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,360
Mercury specifically targets
the central nervous system.

348
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,540
Are you sayingthis was my fault?

349
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,830
Mercury poisoning explains the seizures.

350
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,970
The liver is likea big soup strainer.

351
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,430
Soup runs through.
Chicken dumplings stay.

352
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,810
For soup, read blood.
For chicken dumplings--

353
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,940
I get it, I get it.
Mercury.

354
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,790
Sits more or less idle until your kid
pours tequila shooters into his liver.

355
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,240
When the liver goes,takes out the kidneys.
Explains everything.

356
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,610
Yeah, it's me.Foreman, draw blood.
Test for mercury poisoning.

357
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,750
Chase.Start heavy metal chelation
while we're waiting for results.

358
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,650
Chase isn't here.
I'll start the--

359
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,400
where is he?

360
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,490
The lab.

361
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,970
- How many pills does he take a day?
- It's hard to say.

362
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:34,380
Pain levels vary over time.
Could be six, eight, ten.

363
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,440
Ever write any prescriptions for him?

364
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,120
- Yes.
- Why? Did he tell you to?

365
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,750
He asked me to.

366
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:55,430
Medicine...attracts people
who are attracted to power.

367
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,370
I know how he hates when he is defied by a patient.

368
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,150
I doubt he handles defiance
from his staff any better.

369
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,130
Now, you correct meif I'm wrong.

370
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,630
But I don't think dr. House asks for anything.

371
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,890
I think he takes it.

372
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:21,330
And I think that you are stuck lying
to the police to cover up something...

373
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,070
you didn't want to do.

374
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,090
we have been up and down st.James
like a monopoly car.

375
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,770
It's not here.
Giancarlo has left the building.

376
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,360
We could still turn around
and go back to princeton.

377
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,720
No!We've come this far.
I'm getting the hoagie.

378
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,680
If your son does have mercury poisoning,
there's a good chance he'll respond to the chelation.

379
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,760
You might be able to have
a few minutes with him before you lapse.

380
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,690
Why are you so concerned about me?

381
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,360
Deep inside, wilson believes that
if he cares enough,he'll never have to die.

382
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,600
- Your behavior isn't normal.
- And you would know normal.

383
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:14,650
What could he have done that you won't forgive
after ten years,when this is your last chance?

384
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,370
My son is what he is.

385
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,600
His mother's side?
All drunken losers.

386
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,610
He's gone the same way.

387
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,770
House told you that drinking
had damaged your son's liver.

388
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,060
I just said that.

389
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,580
But you didn't hear him say that
till after we left the hospital.

390
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,120
So why did you leave?

391
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,590
maybe your son takes after your side.

392
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,650
- Seizures and an allergy to emotional connections.
- Okay, okay, okay.Enough.

393
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,110
We're in atlantic city,
and my time's not up yet.

394
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,960
We'll find a hotel with a casino.

395
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,720
Bp's starting to drop.

396
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,790
O2-sat's down to 70.

397
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,790
0.3 milligrams of epi in.

398
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,610
What are you trying to do?
Make him bleed faster?

399
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,060
Check the pulse.

400
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,700
It's not his liver.

401
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,760
It's the heart.

402
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,310
I understand he's a french chef,
but I'm sure he can handle this.

403
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,390
We need a 12-inch italian roll,
oregano vinegar--

404
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,280
no.Not balsamic vinegar.
Oregano vinegar.

405
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,640
Quid pro quo, clarice.
Game's still on.

406
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,920
I thought the answer was mercury poisoning.

407
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,030
What other questions would you care about?

408
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,530
If you each had one day to live,
you'd lookfor one last meal,

409
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,860
and house would lookfor
one last answer.

410
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,410
No, can you just send
the ingredients up here?

411
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,450
And I'll make it myself.

412
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,920
Last ten years.
How much awareness did you have?

413
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,140
I don't know.
I knew it wasn'tthe next day.

414
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:59,100
I--I knew that--
I recognized your voice.

415
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,060
How often were you in my room?

416
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,670
No.You're wasting a question.

417
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,340
I have a better one.

418
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,860
- Why steal my pad?
- oh, my god.You're right.

419
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,700
I'm an addict.
Thanks for opening my eyes.

420
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,950
No, I mean, why my pad?

421
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,090
Foreman, cameron, and chase's pads
are just as convenient.

422
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,140
But their association with you
is involuntary.They're employees.

423
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,060
I associate with you through choice.

424
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,510
And any relationship that involves choice
you have to seehow far you can push before it breaks.

425
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,030
This is easy.

426
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,320
You ask the questions,answer them,
and make tasty snacks.

427
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,280
Let's go try the casino.

428
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,340
And one day,our friendship will break.

429
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,700
And that'll just prove your theory
that relationships are conditional,

430
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,480
and you don't need
human connection,or deserve it,

431
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,700
or whatever goes on in that
rat maze of your brain.

432
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,060
Sorry.If I'd known
he was gonna be this annoying,

433
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,810
I would've stolen dr. Cameron's pad
and dr. Foreman's car.

434
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,960
At least she appreciates my brooding melancholy.

435
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,920
House's house of whining.
State your complaint.

436
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,780
- Patient's bp just dropped like a stone.
- Do an echo.

437
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,450
- Mercury isn't likely to damage--
- it didn'T.

438
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,900
Mercury test was negative.

439
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,350
Do an echo.

440
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,510
I was wrong.
Your son's still dying.

441
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,810
I need to go over every relative
you ever had again.

442
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,910
This time, forget their diseases.
Just tell me how they died.

443
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,810
We don't have time to take turns.

444
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,230
Gimme the answers.
You get a big one at the end.

445
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,580
You go for whatever you want.
Destroy my privacy,my dignity.

446
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,310
- your grandmother?
- Heat exhaustioN. Fourth of july picnic.

447
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,790
The woman was 92.

448
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:48,140
Does anyone in the kitchen know the hoagie shop
that used to be on st.James place?

449
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,340
Your sister-in-lawwith the diabetes.

450
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,430
- As far as you know,is she still alive?
- She's not.

451
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,120
Killed in a traffic accident
driving homefrom a phillies game.

452
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,960
I'm sure a lot of beer was consumed.
Phillies lost.

453
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,410
- Your father?
- Old age.Heart finally gave out.

454
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,460
- Your wife's father?
- Hit-and-run.

455
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,910
Walking the incontinent dog.

456
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,620
Uh, hi.
Do you guys deliver?

457
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,840
Let me put it this way.If you deliver,
there'll be a $100 tip in it for you.

458
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,580
Excellent!
Victory.

459
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,260
Ha, ha, the night isfinally going my way.

460
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,260
Wilson, toss me a soda.

461
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,360
Shall we go somewhereto talk?

462
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:43,230
House is an ass.
But he obviously needs pain medication.

463
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,140
How much pain one person feels
is not a call the government should be making.

464
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,220
So you think I'm a bureaucrat with a badge
following some arbitrary guideline.

465
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,240
- Yeah.I do.
- Oh.

466
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,610
So you're saying I should...
just trust him.Do you?

467
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,990
- You're not qualified to make that--
- I'm not sure you are,either.

468
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:07,080
I've been a cop for 20 years,and not a day
goes by that someone doesn't try to

469
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,450
sell me someself-serving story.

470
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,460
If you had my job,you'd know.

471
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,440
Everybody lies.

472
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,250
Think you've run out of relatives.

473
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,240
So.
It's my turn.

474
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Why did you become a doctor?

475
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,150
That's the big question?

476
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:40,070
I gave you complete license to humiliate me,
and that's the best you can do?

477
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,230
Well, okay.Let's discuss
the wonder of the human body.

478
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,070
No, no, no.
You're a curious guy.

479
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,920
You like to figure things out.
Why not go into research?

480
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:54,150
Why work with people when you...
obviously hate people?

481
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,240
Oedipal fixation.

482
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,980
I was seeking my mother's love,and she thought
that ben casey was just the dreamiest--

483
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,940
okay, fine.You don't think you'll need
any more answers from me?

484
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,640
Give me a hard time.

485
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:20,360
When I was 14,my father was stationed in japan.

486
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,620
I went rock climbing with this kid from school.

487
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,030
He fell, he got injured,
and I had to bring him to the hospital.

488
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,330
We came in through the wrong entrance
and passed this guy in the hall.

489
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,420
It was a janitor.

490
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,280
My friend came down with an infection
and the doctors didn't know what to do.

491
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:47,390
So they brought in...
the janitor.

492
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,670
He was a doctor.

493
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,560
And a buraku.

494
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,150
One of japan's untouchables.

495
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:03,540
His ancestors had been
slaughterers,gravediggers.

496
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,450
And this guy,he knew that
he wasn't accepted by the staff.

497
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,980
Didn't even try.
He didn't dress well.

498
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,840
He didn't pretend to be one of them.

499
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:19,930
The people that ran that place,
they didn't think that he had anything they wanted.

500
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,260
Except when they needed him.

501
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,270
Because he was right.

502
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,280
Which meant that nothing else mattered.

503
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,890
And they had to listen to him.

504
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,490
Thank you.

505
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,650
Need 20 milligram sof diazepam in a syringe.

506
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,950
Heart beat's irregularand accelerating.

507
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,570
- It's at 200.
- He's gonna crash.

508
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,100
- Allergic reactionto the diazepam?
- Better hope so.

509
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,270
It's either that,or his heart's done.

510
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,100
What happened on the night of the fire?

511
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,610
Yeah, I'm sure it's a
stressful emotional question.

512
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,630
Suck it up.

513
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:32,960
My wife had takena sleeping pill
and gone to bed.It was christmas eve.

514
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:38,920
I let kyle pop corn in the fireplace.
He managed to...

515
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,810
knock loose some tinder.

516
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,700
Wrapping paper caught on fire.

517
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,780
Spread.So fast.
I got kyle out.

518
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,080
And when I went back in for--

519
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,640
you're a disappointment.

520
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,710
You act as though
you don't need anybody.

521
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,990
You--you just blame your son
for what happened.

522
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,860
I don't blame him.
He was a 12-year-old boy.

523
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,970
You don't blame a kid for an accident.

524
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,910
Then what are we doing here?
Why aren't you with him?

525
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,780
Because it wouldn't matter!

526
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,850
I failed to keep my family safe!

527
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,450
I couldn't stop the fire.
I couldn't save my wife!

528
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,340
Now you want meto stick around watching
while I fail to save my son.

529
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,400
Thank you so much for waking me up.

530
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,740
How did your son dislodge the tinder?

531
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,130
He dropped the popcorn tray.

532
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,350
He had been complaining it was too heavy.
I should've listened.

533
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,870
And the hit-and-run.
Walking the pissy dog.

534
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,220
- That happen at night?
- I think so, yeah.Why?

535
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,360
Car accident after the phillies lost.
Night game?

536
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,110
Ragged red fiber.
It's an inherited condition.

537
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:05,210
Dropping things, muscle weakness.
Poor night vision.

538
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,240
Makes people seem uncoordinated,
accident-prone,careless.

539
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,650
It's transmittedin mitochondrial dna.

540
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,650
So it only passes through the mother.

541
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,980
Your wife's family weren't drunks.
They were sick.

542
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,540
- It wouldn't have affected his liver.
- The kid is a drunk.

543
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,970
He thinks that he killed his mother
and turned his father into a vegetable.

544
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,550
You know, I might have a few shots myself.

545
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,510
- Foreman.
- Test his dna for ragged rediber.

546
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,170
- It's not gonna--
- here's a thought.

547
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,250
Why don't we not assume that the test
is negative until we actually do it?

548
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,600
House.
The kid has severe cardiomyopathy.

549
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,990
Alcoholic.
No shot at a transplant.

550
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,600
So yeah, maybe you figured out why.
Good for you, but...

551
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,000
he's gonna die anyway.

552
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,490
I want to give kyle my heart.

553
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:28,300
This thing--whatever it is--
you said he gets it from the mother.My heart's fine.

554
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,780
And it could go on being fine
for the rest of your life.

555
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,880
yeah.It's not like
he's gonna do anything with it.

556
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,340
Well, you woke him up once.

557
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,340
Maybe someone will come up
with some other answer.

558
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,020
We've both seen breakthroughs
no one expected.

559
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,250
And ragged red fiber's treatable,
but not curable.

560
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,650
Even if he gets your heart,
there's no guarantee.

561
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,560
He's my kid.

562
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,920
No.Did you really expect
a different answer?

563
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,880
We have arranged transplants before
when a patient is near death.

564
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,480
Except he isn't near death.

565
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,250
He's saying,"kill me
and cut out my heart."

566
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,830
Are you out of your mind?

567
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,060
Fine.
I'll think of something else.

568
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,360
I'm sorry.

569
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:35,120
Wilson.
Get out.

570
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,080
No.

571
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,990
You've lied to the cops enough for me.

572
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,660
Maybe I don't wanna
push this till it breaks.

573
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,660
Pills are the simplest.

574
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:25,320
Hanging has less chance of damaging the heart.

575
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,270
I'm okay with pain.

576
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,650
Strangulation is better than breaking your neck.

577
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,880
Which means this'll be slow.

578
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,260
I wouldn't get to see him
even if we got in the car right now

579
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:48,500
and broke the speed limit driving back,would I?

580
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,510
No.

581
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,260
Tell him-

582
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,300
I don't knowwhat to tell him.

583
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,720
Think it's my turn to ask a question, isn't it?

584
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,370
I don't think so.

585
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,720
'Cause you just asked me that thing
about the speed limit.

586
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,860
What do you wanna know?

587
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,570
If if you could hear one thing
from your father,what would it be?

588
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,470
- It wouldn't help you.
- Try me.

589
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,170
I'd want him to say...

590
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:48,840
"You were right.
You did the right thing."

591
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,480
Yeah.
It doesn't help.

592
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,660
- Hi.
- Hi.

593
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,930
- I'm dr. Wilson.
- I'm mrs. Schaeffer.

594
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,500
I'm from princeton.

595
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:25,240
My husband and i and our
three children live in philadelphia.

596
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:32,880
So, uh...
do you like to swing?

597
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,050
No.

598
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:40,260
Well, if you change your mind,I'm in--

599
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,650
house.House!
Is it room 622? 642?

600
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,290
- 622.
- 622.

601
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,630
Yeah.

602
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,210
- Alibi.
- I figured.

603
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,460
They found an open bottle
of aspirin by the body.

604
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,620
Lucky he had a headache.

605
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,510
Reduced trauma to the heart in transit.

606
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,620
Lucky.

607
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,620
That can't be all.

608
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,910
Well, you got a heart out of it.

609
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,020
How many organs do you want from the guy?

610
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,380
I mean,my father must have said something.

611
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,000
He couldn't just--he must have given you
some kind of a message for me.

612
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:51,580
He said you were right.
You did the right thing.

613
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,690
Right about what?

614
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,270
What does that mean?

615
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:06,160
How would I know?
He's your dad.

616
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,140
You know what I found
interesting about this case?

617
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,640
That it proved that people can love unconditionally,
and you can tell yourselfit's not true,

618
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,940
but you'll just end up in a hotel room
in atlantic city asking someone to cut your heart out?

619
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,940
The hoagie.

620
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,200
You thought this guy was emotionally
confused and that the hoagiewas just a mask

621
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,070
to hide his real feelingstowards his son.

622
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,750
It was.

623
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,550
Did you know tritter was talking
to your team while we were away?

624
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,000
Yeah.

625
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,690
And yet you moved heaven and earth
to get him that mask with mustard and prosciutto.

626
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,570
- Which one of them told you?
- All of them.

627
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,870
Which means that none of them
said anythingI have to worry about.

628
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,420
Back to the hoagie.

629
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,560
You think that my addiction's out of hand.

630
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,210
Your need to be needed is so strong

631
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,220
that you'll give people what they want,
what they need,what they think they need.

632
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,400
I don't think my enablingis anything
you should be complaining about.

633
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:14,840
Yes, my nameis dr. James wilson.
Accot number 835687.

634
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,790
The atm says I've got zero--

635
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,140
what does that mean--a hold?

636
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,300
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.

637
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:36,280
My accounts have been frozen
as part of a police investigation.

638
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,460
They can't keep your money forever.

639
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,330
No, they can keep it till I agree
to help send you to prison for ten yearS.

640
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,200
You're getting dinner.
