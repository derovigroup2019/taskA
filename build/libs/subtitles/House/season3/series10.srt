00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,780
*Gifts I'm preparin'for some christmas sharin'*

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,700
*but I pause because*

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,730
*hang in my stockin'I can hear the knockin'*

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,540
*'zat you, santa claus*

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,530
*sure is dark outnot the slighest spark out*

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,310
*pardon my clackin' jaws*

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,360
*who's there, who is ituh, stoppin' for a visit*

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,850
*'zat you, santa claus*

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,390
- merry christmas.
- And a happy go to hell.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,380
What's he doing here?
Is he with you?

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,080
Detective tritter and I...
we worked out a deal.

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,020
Already got a lawyer.
Get out of my office.

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,850
I told him I didn'twrite those prescriptions.

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,170
I spoke with the da.

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,750
He agreed to two monthsin a rehab facility
in exchangefor a guilty plea.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,330
Get out of my office.

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,900
- No jail time.
- Right.

18
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,810
I should get locked upin some place I don't belong

19
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,330
in order to avoidgetting locked up
in some other placeI don't belong.

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,540
I got you on forgeryand fraud.

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,200
- Enough drugs--
- no sanctionsto the medical board.

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,080
And you get your car backand your bank accounts
and your precioustumor-ridden patients.

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,950
I did this to help you.

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,400
Next christmas,buy me a sweater.
You punched outan employee.

25
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,930
You nearly cuta little girl in half
because you weretoo strung out--

26
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,510
I was in pain!

27
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,030
You need to believethat I've got a problem
so that your betrayal hasthe illusion of nobility.

28
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,460
- But you just selfishly--
- knock it off.

29
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,360
Look, I don't carewhy dr. Wilsonis doing this.

30
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,120
And right now, it makesno difference to you either.

31
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,850
You need to dealwith the realityof your current situation.

32
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,960
You want to stand on principle,you end up in a cell.

33
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,370
And you end up neverpracticing medicine again.

34
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,230
So you've got two choices.
Your principlesor your life.

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,210
Get out of my office.

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,910
The da put a clockon the deal.

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,430
You've got three daysto decide.

41
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,090
house!
Just give me a minute.

42
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,890
- You're afraidof the pain.
- You're not?

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,740
You can still havepain meds in rehab.

44
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,970
- Tramadol, gabapentin--
- those don't work.

45
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,140
They will once you'reweaned off the vodin.

46
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,170
Look, there's jesus.
Better go tell the romans.

47
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,000
Fine, run to cuddy.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,510
You don't think she'sgonna support me on this?

49
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,340
Well, the stitches arehealing nicely.
There's no signof infection.

50
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,330
Whoa.

51
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,310
Sorry.

52
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,950
Just need herfor a tiny moment.
Small favor.

53
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,700
Pills.

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,780
- Who's the wit?
- Doctor.

55
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,730
Don't worry.
I'll be firing him soon.

56
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,900
Wait in my office.

57
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,860
Incision looks just bigenough for a chest tube.
Collapsed lung?

58
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,820
Someone mistake youfor a pinata?

59
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,330
Delightful.Usually we just get
the elf jokes this time of year.

60
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,770
No on trauma.
Negative ppd.

61
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,680
What flavor dwarfsare you guys?

62
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,080
My daughter and I both havecartilage hair hypoplasia.

63
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,830
Think you can make a punout of that?

64
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,360
Yes, but I don't wantto be insensitive.

65
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,230
She's got a bit ofa short fuse, doesn't she?

66
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,140
It's a bleb.
Wait in my office.

67
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,190
Bleb's not a diagnosis.
It's an evasion.

68
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,560
We'll schedule an mrito make sure.

69
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,230
But a certain number ofese cases are idiopathic.

70
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,930
Let me translate thatinto tolkien for you guys.

71
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,060
Means dr. Cuddy'sgot no idea why your
daughter's lung suddenly popped like a balloon.

72
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,400
You think you do?

73
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,960
Give me her chart.
And my pills.

74
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,170
Santa needs us.

75
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,990
Did you get thatlooked at?

76
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,700
- I'm fine.
- Great.

77
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,380
I just admitted a cartilagehair hypoplasia dwarf.

78
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,920
- 15 years old--
- what are you gonna do?

79
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,950
I thought I'd getyour theories,mock them,
then embrace my own.The usual.

80
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,250
Wilson told us he ratted.

81
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,190
Your choice of verb,I take it.

82
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,840
It's appropriate.He betrayed you.
And you shouldtake the deal.

83
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,800
Unexplained lung collapseand anemia.
Cuddy thinksit's idiopathic.

84
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,790
"Cuddy" and "idiop" beingthe relevant partsof that sentence.

85
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,130
Well, I'd say tb, but cuddy'salready ruled it out.

86
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,550
Then you'd be just as bigan "idiop" as her.
Don't you peopleknow your dwarves?

87
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,570
There are over 200varieties of dwarfism,
each with differentmedical complications.

88
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,300
You can't expect us to beintimately
familiarwith all of them.

89
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,980
- The sick dwarvessure expect you to.
- Cartilage hairhypoplasia.

90
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,840
- They have compromisesimmune systems.
- Gold star for cameron.

91
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,640
For extra credit,explain to the special needssection the class

92
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,080
why our patient's negativetb test is irrelevant.

93
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,480
A pdd involves plantinga fragment of tb under the skin
to see if the immunesystem recognizes it.

94
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,590
Because of a compromisedimmune system,
our patient could have tbbut not recognize it.

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,850
The little peoplelove you.

96
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,660
Let's go see a dwarfabout a gallium scan.

97
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,920
Gallium isa radioactive isotope.

98
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,810
It travelsthrough your veinsallowing us to seeany bright spotsthat mightindicate infection.

99
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,150
I'm 4'1".
That's 1.5 canesin metric.

100
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,260
You don't look a dayover four feet.

101
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,270
- I saw in the file thather dad was normal-sized.
- It's average-sized.

102
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,740
Compared to you,I'm sure it was huge.

103
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,200
So did he have a fetish,or did he just
fall in lovewith your long-legged soul?

104
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,790
He grew up in the circus.
Said I reminded him of home.

105
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,090
Seems like you're the onewith the fetish.

106
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,820
I'm certainly curiousabout the logistics.

107
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,760
- Did you stand on a table?
- House.

108
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,940
- Pretty much he'd flatand spin me.
- Mom!

109
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,600
so, abigail,you want to hop upon the table for me?

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,570
- That's gonna be tough.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,730
Uh, let me give youa boost.

112
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,410
stop treating herlike she's five.

113
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,600
Just bring over a stooland let her climb up herself.

114
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,400
Mom, it's okay.

115
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,620
I was just tryingto be helpful.

116
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,840
She also hates jews.

117
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,150
I've dealt with worse.Being different,
you getused to people's idiocy.

118
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,220
Still beats the hell outof actually being an idiot.

119
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,330
What?

120
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,030
Care to go for a spin?

121
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,500
What the hellwere you thinking?

122
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:44,180
You didn't thinkratting outthis hospital's
best doctor meritedchecking withyour boss first?

123
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,240
I didn't rat him out.
I got him a deal.

124
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,520
Which he'll never take.

125
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,160
- He will if we--
- how long have youknown house?

126
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,210
Did you think he'dsuddenly become reasonable?

127
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,380
I made the deal.
It's done.

128
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,270
You can either keepyelling at me,
or you can help meavoid a complete disaster.

129
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,740
It already is gonna bea complete disaster.

130
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,560
He's not gonna take the deal.
He's gonna go to jail.

131
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,020
Because he's a child.
He's too stubborn.

132
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,470
When a child misbehaves,what do you do?

133
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,330
You take awaysomething he loves.

134
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,800
We can't take awayhis vicodin.

135
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,600
Not only will he be in pain,
he'll start to detox.

136
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,580
We tell him the only wayto get
the pills backis to take the deal.

137
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,070
- He won't be ableto function.
- That's the point.

138
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,990
You gonna explain thatto his patient?

139
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,240
What choice do we have?

140
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,130
Gallium scan shows nobright spots of any kind.

141
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,090
Means it's not tbor any other infection.

142
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,130
There's no bright spotsbecause the whole thing'stoo bright.

143
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,030
Except for the liver.

144
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,170
The tech overexposedthe image a bit,but it's nothing.

145
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,040
- The liver looks fine.
- Could be lung cancer.

146
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,490
Tumor causesstructural damage.
Lung caves inon itself.Also explainsthe anemia.

147
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,310
Doesn't explain the liverproblem, though.

148
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,670
Her lung collapsed.
There is no liver problem.

149
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,270
You guys look at the liveron this thing?

150
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,150
- There's no liver problem.
- Seriously,look at the liver.

151
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,120
- There's nothing there.
- Why not?

152
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,410
Because there'snothing wrong.

153
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,010
Every organ in the scanis lit uplike a 100-watt bulb.

154
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,740
Except for her liver, whichis hovering around 60 watts.

155
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,180
And not one of them good60-watters,
but an energy--

156
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,000
you're saying her liver'sshutting down
because the lightingis off?

157
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,440
You just don't want a cancer diagnosis
because then you'd have to deal with wilson.

158
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,210
Lung cancer isa lame diagnosis.
Avoiding wilson isan added bonus.

159
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,880
House, we need to talk.

160
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,920
Not taking the deal.
Glad we talked.

161
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,090
Ultrasound her liver.

162
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,280
- Sit down.
- Stand up.

163
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,360
- Your turn.
- House, you're offthe case.

164
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,760
Your treatment privilegesare suspended
until you accepttritter's deal.

165
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,690
Well, I'm obviouslynot gonna take the deal
just so I can have the funof treating a dwarf.

166
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,260
So i assume there'smore to this threat.

167
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,060
- I'm also cutting offyour vicodin.
- That could work.

168
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,680
I'm taking over as attending.
Get an mri of her lungs.

169
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,150
This is not lung cancer.

170
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,860
We'll find out as soonas we mri her lungs.

171
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,270
You're gonna come begging meto save this girl
long before I comebegging your for pills.

172
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,810
I hope not.
For everyone's sake.

173
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,780
- this is wrong.
- Cutting house off?

174
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,840
Might not work,but it's not wrong.

175
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,000
Bone windows looks clean.

176
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,970
- Abigail, we need youto hold still, okay?
- can I come out?

177
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,120
Just hang in there two more minutes and we'll be done.

178
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,440
Okay.

179
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,250
Because it's effectivedoesn't make it right.

180
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,170
Cuddy's bending the rules to
get a patientto do the right thing.

181
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,190
- Who'd work for a doctorlike that?
- And the endsjustify the means?

182
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,170
If the ends involve uskeeping our jobs, sure.

183
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,250
Lung parenchyma is clean.
No masses.

184
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,780
It's not lung cancer.

185
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,270
Abigail, you okay?

186
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,350
House was right.
Her liver's failing.

187
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,740
Endoscopy confirmedthe vomiting
was cause byvariceal bleeding.

188
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,690
Bloodwork also confirmshouse's hypothesis--

189
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,880
I get it.House was right.
It's the liver.Let's move on.

190
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,760
What causes liver diseaseand a collapsed lung?

191
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,340
- Schistosomiasis,the parasite--
- there's no eosinophilia

192
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,100
- Cirrhosis could explain--
- could be a hepatoma.

193
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,090
She's 15.
It's not liver cancer.

194
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,900
It's not unheard of.

195
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,240
Cirrhosis fits better.
The question is,what caused it?

196
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,760
- Could be hepatitis,budd-chiari.
- Or drugs and alcohol.

197
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,570
If anyone has a reasonto dull the pain,
it's a teenage dwarf.

198
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,940
I'll do a liver biopsyto confirm.

199
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,720
I'll search the patient's homefor drugs and alcohol.

200
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,100
Cameron,you got a moment?

201
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,340
What exactly isyour problem with me?

202
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,940
Hepatoma isa weak diagnosis.

203
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,740
- So this isall about the case?
- What elsewould it be about?

204
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,020
I made this dealto help him.

205
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,200
And helped yourselfat the same time.

206
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,990
This is not my practice.
This is not about my car.

207
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,170
I gave both of them upto help house,
and I would've gone onwithout them

208
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,410
if hadn't almost maimedthat little girl
and if he hadn'tpunched out chase.

209
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,280
Was it an easy choice?

210
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,730
- Of course not,but it's right.
- Then why wasn't it easy?

211
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,630
Because he's my friend.

212
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,230
- It's obviously complicated.
- It's complicated?

213
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,910
When you decidedto talk to tritter,
your life gota million times better.

214
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,320
How do youseparate that out?

215
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,710
How do you pretendyour windfall
isn't relevantto this decision?

216
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,650
It was the right thingto do.

217
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,260
You pretendingyour motives are pureis why I have a problem.

218
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,090
- Where's cuddy?
- In this drawer.It's a rescue mission.

219
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,790
But I got it under control.
You can leave.

220
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,250
You were rightabout the liver failure.

221
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,050
Patient hadvariceal bleeding
which suggestedcirrhosis, but--

222
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,470
off the clock.

223
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,490
You predicted this.
You obviously saw something.

224
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,080
Obviously.

225
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,100
Liver biopsy was negativefor cirrhosis.

226
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,050
But it showssclerosing cholangitis.

227
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,160
Even weirder,there's no increasein alkaline phosphatase.

228
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,740
Medical mystery.

229
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,020
Sounds like the kindof thing I'd be good at.

230
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,090
Breaking and entering.
Sounds like the kindof thing you'd be good at.

231
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,340
I take it that's where cuddy'sbeen keeping your pills.

232
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,020
One theory, one drawer.

233
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,660
Really?I thought you'd be all
for this "torture house plan".

234
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,270
It works,therefore it's good.

235
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,870
On the other hand, I don'twant to talk you
outof this deal by pointing outyour hypocrisy,

236
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,970
so patient's life at stake,blah, blah, blah, blah.

237
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,800
Forget aboutthe specific nature
of the liver dysfunction.It's irrelevant.

238
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,810
The dwarf's problem is global.
That's why the gallium scanwas bright.

239
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,570
And it's gonna spread throughout
her entire bodyunless you stop it.

240
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,920
If that were true,more than lungs and liverwould be affected.

241
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,700
They will be.It'll spread though the
biliary treeand hit her pancreas next.

242
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,870
Strop retracing your steps.
Get ahead of it.

243
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,980
Forget the liver and focuson the pancreas.

244
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,170
'Cause after that--actually, after that
doesn't really matterwhat it hits

245
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,610
because pretty much all roadslead to a dead dwarf.

246
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,970
I get why you don'twant to go to rehab.

247
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,650
But only an idiot goes toprison for being stubborn.

248
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,300
Only an idiot stands between
ahab and his whale.Move.

249
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,070
Sorry.

250
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,540
Santa's got gifts.

251
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,720
Olive oilwasn't in the kitchen.
It was inthe medicine cabinet.

252
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,000
Home remedyfor ear infections.

253
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,410
Ear infectionsare fairly typicalamong chh dwarfs.

254
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,200
Or it's a symptom.

255
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,350
Certainly wouldn't indicatea pancreatic problem.

256
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,090
Or house is wrongand it's a symptom.

257
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,750
Laxatives.I don't thinkthey were used
to maintainher girlish figure.

258
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,920
- Again, intestinal problemsare common--
- again, it might bea symptom.

259
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,560
And glucosamine suggestschronic joint pain--

260
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,620
who ordered the alpha-1antitrypsin deficiency test?

261
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,060
I did.

262
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,640
You think the problem'sin her pancreas?

263
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,270
Well, I think it will be.
I think we need toforget about the liver.

264
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,440
We just forgotabout the lungs.
Now we need to forgetabout the liver?

265
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,910
We need to stopretracing our steps
and get aheadof this thing.

266
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,400
House, you've tanned.

267
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,230
You don't think I could'vecome up with this?

268
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,640
Did you?

269
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,010
You suspended housebecause it'd be dangerous
having him in charge,but getting his opinion--

270
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,950
I'm sure he gave youthat opinionsimply
because he wasworried about the patient.

271
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,750
Just because house wants his pills
doesn't meanhis theory is wrong.

272
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,290
No, the test resultsmean that.
Your test was negative.

273
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,670
And the biopsy indicated severe duct inflammation.

274
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,620
Do an ercp to check the liverfor bile duct cancer.

275
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,740
Just because it wasn'talpha-1 doesn't meanthe pancreas isn't next.

276
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,420
you needed an organ.
He needed a fix.

277
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,190
He'd have made upany story for a pill.
You didn't give himanything, did you?

278
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,800
No.

279
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,130
There's no bruise or nothing,
but it really hurts.

280
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,640
Unfortunately, that painand lack of bruising.
Is typical ofa zygomatic break.

281
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,290
- That sounds bad.
- Hmm, bones arealigned properly.

282
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,980
Which er did you go toafter the car accident?

283
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,770
Princeton plainsboro.
Here's my discharge slip.

284
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,090
Okay.Gonna get you someacetaminophen with codeine.

285
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,250
I tried that,and it makes me nauseous.

286
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,960
Uh, there's a drugcalled gabapentin
which is good for certainkinds of pains.

287
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,500
Great, 'cause I haven'tslept in days.

288
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,930
Gabapentin's not reallygonna help with the sleep.

289
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,870
Is there something elseyou can give me?

290
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,210
Uh, vicodin's your best betwith sleep issues.

291
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,740
Thanks so much.

292
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,520
Unfortunately,our policy forbids
prescribing opiates to new patients.

293
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,900
How can a clinic have a ruleagainst relieving pain?

294
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,190
Just with opiates.
We find that it helpsweed out drug seekers.

295
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,460
- You think I'm a drug seeker?
- I'm not saying that.

296
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,540
- Well, thengive me the vicodin.
- I can'T.

297
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,350
- Because you thinkI'm a drug seeker.
- I just said I didn'T.

298
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,630
No, you said that the policywas to stop drug seeking.

299
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,590
Then you said I'm nota drug seeker.
Policy doesn't apply.

300
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,150
I'm sorry.
That's the policy.

301
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,020
Gabapentin workson nerve damage.
You're prescribing itfor a broken face.

302
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,480
Might as wellhand out band-aidsfor a severed carotid.

303
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,510
You're a doctor.

304
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,150
Not by thisclinic's definitionsince I'm neither a moronnor a mindless drone.

305
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,690
- Security.
- Forget it.I'll throw myself out.

306
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,110
That tube is goingall the way down to my liver?

307
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,430
Don't worry.
You'll be sedated.

308
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,600
Sometimes doctorshave to do things
that make peopleuncomfortable to help them.

309
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:16,810
But we always want torespect the patient's wishes
and not shove thingsdown their throats.

310
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,790
Foreman.

311
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,380
- You haven't given herthe sedative.
- No.

312
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,710
Abigail!
Abigail!

313
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,530
She's unconscious.

314
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,090
Check her airway.

315
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,760
Airway's clear.
Her breath smells fruity.

316
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,830
Diabetic ketoacidosis.

317
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,560
Hang an insult drip at.1 migs per kig per hour.

318
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,760
Pancreas is failing.
You ready to callhouse yet?

319
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,570
You were right.
The patient's pancreasis failing.

320
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,310
Told you you'd comebegging me for help.

321
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,480
Her insulin production
is almost non-existent--

322
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,950
- give me my pillsor lose an arm.
- The girl is dying.

323
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,240
- So give me my pills.
- Take the deal and I will.

324
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,380
You'd rather kill this girlthan give me my pills.

325
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:21,120
I would rather loseone patient now
than the dozens we will losewhile you're in prison.

326
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,590
Well, have funexplaining that
to her itsy-bitsygrieving mother.

327
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,980
what if we sacrifice this girl
and house still goes to jail?

328
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,640
I'd feel bad.
Can we get on with this?

329
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,520
House correctlypredicted the spread.

330
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,720
Means we've gota global systemic illness
affecting lungs, liver,and pancreas so far.Ideas.

331
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,980
Langerhanscell histiocytosisattacks multipleorgan systems.

332
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,370
Histiocytosis usuallystarts in the brain,
then moves to the internal organs.

333
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,110
Abigail's brain is fine.
Cystic fibrosis.

334
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,810
Exocrine function is normaL.
Hodgkins lymphoma.

335
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,290
It's a systemic cancer which her dwarfismpredisposes her to.

336
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,690
Do you have any ideasthat aren't cancer?

337
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,560
- Cancer fits.
- Autoimmune fits better.

338
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,140
We should treat herwith prednisone for lupus.

339
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,350
That'll spike her blood sugar and put her back in a coma.

340
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,370
It's much safer just to runa double-stranded dna test.

341
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,810
Not if she dies beforewe get the results.

342
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,940
One of you is probably right.
Why don't we hold the snipinguntil we find out which?

343
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:18,070
Wilson, do an lpfor lymphoma.
You guys, run an antibody testfor lupus.

344
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,770
Because ofyour daughter's dwarfism,we've had to
picka higher entry pointfor the lumbar puncture,

345
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,040
- which increases the risk.
- So why not dothe lupus test first?

346
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,540
In the interest of time,we think it's bestto proceed on both fronts.

347
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,530
You have no idea what'swrong with my daughter.

348
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,470
- We have several theories.
- What does dr. House think?

349
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,020
He's--he had to go home sick.

350
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,380
My daughter may be dying,
and he's gone homewith the sniffles?

351
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,370
He's not--he was the only onewho seemed
to have any ideawhat was wrong with her.

352
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,880
He better bereally damn sick.

353
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,770
He is.

354
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,800
unless you got vicodin, go away.

355
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,460
House, it's me.
I, uh--

356
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,210
oh, god.

357
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:15,280
- I don't have--
- no pills, no egg nog.

358
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,640
What happened to your arm?

359
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,840
Cut myself.

360
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,650
Wilson was wrongabout lymphoma.

361
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,820
Kid's not losing any weight,no night sweats.

362
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,050
Cuddy send you?

363
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,820
No, she doesn't trust menot to give you pills.

364
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,250
Is she right?

365
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,920
House, these cutsare straight in a row.

366
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,510
You did this on purpose.

367
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,380
Cutting releasesendorphins.
Endorphins relieve pain.

368
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,950
You gonna get mesome pills?

369
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,280
- No.
- Then you can leave.

370
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,970
No constitutionalsymptoms means--

371
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,130
soons the kid gets cured,
cuddy's got no pressure to fold.

372
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,790
You really thinkshe's gonna fold?

373
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,450
Autoimmune fits betterthan cancer.

374
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,580
But lupus loves kidneys,
usually attacks them first.

375
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,340
- Kidneys are fine, right?
- Yeah.

376
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,500
House, take the deal.
You can survivewithout vicodin.

377
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,750
After you were shot,you stayed clean for months.

378
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,360
Yeah, I wonder if it had
something to dowith the absence of pain.

379
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,480
Leave that.I want to be able to
pour alcohol on itso I can distract myself.

380
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,960
Then you canrip off the bandage.

381
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,600
Kid been sick lately?
There's a historyof ear infections.

382
00:22:53,150 --> 00:23:00,060
Say abigail's immune systemis like a shy guy in a bar.

383
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:06,560
And the ear infections,they come in and tryto coax him to--heh.

384
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,220
To hell with the metaphor.
You get the point, right?

385
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,830
Nerd gets drunk.
Trashes the bar.

386
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,060
One of the autoimmunestriggered by a minor infection.

387
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,330
Factor in her age,elevated sed-rate, anemia...

388
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,750
it's still's disease.

389
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,020
You start her on prednisone,
methotrexate, cyclosporin.

390
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:34,080
House.Stop this.Please.

391
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,420
- What'd he say?
- Still's disease.

392
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,860
- It's chronic, but manageable.
- A diagnosis that'svirtually unconfirmable.

393
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,840
And with a treatmentthat's more dangerous
than what we wereconsidering for lupus.

394
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,360
How bad is he?

395
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,500
Are you askingbecause you care,
or because you're wonderingwhether to trust his opinion?

396
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,990
Both.

397
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,240
He's detoxing.
In agony.

398
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,700
He startedcutting himself.

399
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,070
But he's still house.

400
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,270
I'll order the treatment.

401
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:55,880
Your plan isn't working.
Two days down,one to go.

402
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,700
Figured I'd show youhow much it isn't working.

403
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,550
Yeah, clearly the drugshave no hold on you.

404
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,920
We both know that my pridefar surpasses my instinctfor self-preservation.

405
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,760
You want to redeem yourself?
Give up now.

406
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,150
And you'll go to jail.

407
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,970
- I've done nothing wrong.
- And you'll go to jail.

408
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:25,550
Which makes thisyour last chanceto do me
a kindness beforeruining my life forever.

409
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,840
The nausea's bad this time.

410
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,470
You can write me a scrip for metoclopramide
so I can stop puking.

411
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,660
They'd give me thatin rehab.

412
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,930
Then you shouldgo to rehab.
I have a patient.

413
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,060
I'm so sorryfor your loss.

414
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,530
I know it's little solace,but he went without pain.

415
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,890
House.

416
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,500
Well, look onthe bright side.

417
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:18,400
At least you don't have to
go by mrs. Zebalusky anymore.

418
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,160
- That's gotta be a relief.
- You know this man?

419
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,300
I'm sorry.
He's sick--

420
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,460
did you hear my diagnosison the dwarf?Still's disease.

421
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,150
Did you even consider those ear infections,
or you just wrote it offas a dwarf thing?

422
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,620
You sure he's dead?
Dr. Wilson sometimesmisses things.

423
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,000
Trying to embarrass mein front of grieving widowcrosses lines--

424
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,760
right!I'm pathetic.

425
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,120
I'm strung out,I haven't slept,
puking every hour,and I still out-diagnosed you.

426
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,850
But I'm supposed to letyou decide what's best--

427
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,510
please!Please leave.

428
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,950
Sorry.
I'm done.

429
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,160
House.

430
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,840
You didn't come in herejust to embarrass me.
You could do that any time.

431
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,120
Stealing oxyfrom a dead man.

432
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,610
Yeah, you don'thave a problem.

433
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,180
- How's the girl?
- Much better.

434
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,600
- House was righT.
- It happens.

435
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,720
I thought we couldhandle this.

436
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,200
Still's diseasenever crossed my mind.

437
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,350
Don't beat yourself up.
I didn't get it either.

438
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,780
I feel likea mob informant.

439
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,960
You wanna go inside?

440
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,060
- Got a cafeteriain there, right?
- I can't testify.

441
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,770
Drug addicts hurt the people
around them with their habit.

442
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,350
House has hurt plentyof people, you included.

443
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,300
He saves lives.
People thatno one else can save.

444
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:30,590
And no matter how muchof an ass he is,
statistically houseis a positive forcein the universe.

445
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,620
The pills let him do that.

446
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:40,340
Vicodin does notmake house a genius.
Whatever he does on the pills,he can do off.

447
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,120
He's just notwilling to try.

448
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,660
I won't testifyagainst him.

449
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,130
Then we'll subpoena you.

450
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,320
And your previous statementwill be read into evidence.

451
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:59,190
And you will be chargedwith interfering
with an investigation.

452
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,460
And you will go to jail.

453
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:11,400
- Again, statistically,better me than him.
- Statistically...

454
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,500
the two of youwill be in jail.

455
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,270
dr. Cameron!Dr. Cameron,come quick.
There's something wrong with abby.

456
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,550
Couldn't be too severe.
Her cardiac alarmdidn't go off.

457
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,990
It's not her heart.
She's bleeding.

458
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,970
Picking up a scrip.
Under zebalusky.

459
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,490
This is, uh,dr. Wilson's patient.

460
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,040
Yeah.
Wilson's busy right now.

461
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:21,800
What with mr. Zebaluskydying in agony
on account of hismetastic lung cancer

462
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:27,790
and not having the pillsto relieve that agony
because of somemoron pharmacist.

463
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,350
Sign the book.

464
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,230
Bleeding wasn't a rupturedeardrum,
ear infection,or bleeding disorder.

465
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,820
Her heart rate's climbing.Blood pressure's dropping.
She's on the vergeof a multi-system failure.

466
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,130
Head ct was clean.
Means it's nota neurological problem.

467
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,870
- Basically we have nothing.
- Cancer is stillon the table.

468
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,070
Spinal fluid wasnegative for lymphoma.

469
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,590
- What other--
- leukemia.We need to doa bone marrow biopsy.

470
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,420
None of the blood testssuggest leukemia.

471
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,370
Cancer doesn't explainthe collapsed lung.

472
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,940
Unless a small clot lead to a pulmonary infarct.

473
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,990
It's a long shot.
Autoimmune is way more likely.

474
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,180
Autoimmune diseasesrespond to steroids,
which we've given her.

475
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,180
And she got betterfor a while.
We stoed the treatmenttoo soon.

476
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,040
Because she crashed.

477
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,580
All we're doing is bouncingback and forthbetween cancerand autoimmune.

478
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,930
We're going in circles.

479
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,480
Give me half an hour.

480
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,240
Can I have a french fry?

481
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,740
- Get your own.
- You took the last ones.

482
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,330
- What's wrong with you?
- I got spinalmuscular atrophy.

483
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,420
Guess it not contagious.

484
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,210
Nice bear.

485
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,490
- It's a dog.
- house.It's not still'S.

486
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,270
Steroids helpeduntil the patient
started bleedingfrom the ears and mouth.

487
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,890
- That's a bear.
- His name is bill.He's a dog.

488
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,030
You win.
You can have vicodin.

489
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,450
Words have set meaningsfor a reason.

490
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,550
If you seean animal like billand you tryto play fetch,
bill's gonna eat youbecause bill's a bear.

491
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,370
Are you on something?

492
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,700
You got your handson pain meds.

493
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,890
Bill has fur,four legs, and a collar.
He's a dog.

494
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,100
It's between cancerand autoimmune.

495
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,560
See, that's what we calla faulty syllogism.

496
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:59,140
Just because you call bill a dog
doesn't mean that he is...a dog.

497
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,240
We gotta x-rayour patient's leg.

498
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,810
- Her leg looks fine.
- Weird, huh?

499
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,100
- Why aren't you detoxing?
- Will power.

500
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,580
What--what--

501
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,550
normal's not normalif you're not normal.

502
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,820
- Did you just take a pill?
- No.

503
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,700
So how does a dwarfhave completely
normal growth plates?

504
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,920
It's impossible.
We must bemissing something.

505
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,690
How many pillshave you taken?

506
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,730
Not nearly as manyas I'm gonna take.
Forgotten how deliciousthey werE.

507
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,520
I didn't give themto him.

508
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,940
Can we forget my vices,get back to my virtues?

509
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,750
We were missing the fact that just because
we called her a dwarfdoesn't mean she is a dwarf.

510
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Everyone assumed she wasbecause of her mother.

511
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,720
There's not testfor chh dwarfism.

512
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,380
So she lost an identity,but we gained a symptom.

513
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,340
If she doesn't haveskeletal dwarfism,

514
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:01,020
then her short staturemust be caused
by growth hormone deficiency.

515
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,810
And something's wrong with her pituitary gland.
And based on her size,it's been wrong for a while.

516
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,570
So what connects a long-termpituitary issue
with problems in the lungs, liver, and pancreas?

517
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,900
Oh, you guysand your bickering.
Cancer versus autoimmune.

518
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:19,360
- Obviously you thinkit's something else.
- Nope.I think it's both.

519
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,860
Langerhans cellhistiocytosis.

520
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:26,240
Also known as,"you got your cancerin my autoimmune" disease.

521
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,550
The immune component respondedto the still's treatment.

522
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,340
Lead to the short-termimprovement.The cancer portion didn'T.

523
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,290
We dismissed this earlier
because there wereno neurological symptoms.

524
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,770
Yeah.It's not your fault.

525
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,430
The only neurological symptomwas her height.

526
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,320
Who could've noticed?

527
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:52,920
This isyour pituitary gland.

528
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,740
And this is the granulomathat's been crushing it.

529
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:00,640
No pituitary equalsno growth hormoneequals about that much.

530
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,860
She's not a dwarf?

531
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,380
Just hormonally challenged.

532
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,500
- What about my mom?
- Your mom'sthe real deal.

533
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,940
But you're justa tiny little poser.

534
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,890
Your recent ear infections caused your bodyto release
a cascade of the same cellsthat made the granuloma.

535
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:20,150
They attacked your lungs,moved down to your liver,
then hitched a rideover to your pancreas.

536
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,510
We can nuke themwith a mild course of chemo
and then removethe granuloma.

537
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,340
And then what?
What will happen to her then?

538
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,850
Let me seeif I can make this clear.

539
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,040
This pill represents...a pill.

540
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,920
And my mouth representsyour daughter's mouth.

541
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,070
We deposit the pillin the month.

542
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,780
You may never be tall enoughto play in the wnba,
but you'll be ableto post up your mom no problem.

543
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,330
What if I don'ttake the pills?

544
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:02,310
What if you remove the thing in my headand give me the chemo,but not the pills?

545
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,600
Would I stillget better?

546
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:09,270
Your body needsgrowth hormonefrom lots of things.
Like...to grow.

547
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,390
I like who i am now.

548
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,540
- Nobody your agelikes who they are now.
- I do.

549
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,190
You like needing helpwhen you want somethingoff a high shelf?

550
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,750
Not being able to pressan elevator buttonabove the eighth floor?

551
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,590
Having to smell assevery time you stand in line?

552
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,830
You don't need growth hormone.
It's just your ticketout of the freak show.

553
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,520
Can't you delivera diagnosiswithout
making her feel thather life isn't worth living?

554
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,010
I'm trying to help her.

555
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,530
You're tryingto make her taller.

556
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,390
Not too tall.
Just tall enoughto wipe her own butt.

557
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,370
- Are you high?
- Higher than you.

558
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,650
If my daughterdoesn't want to choosethe easy path,I won't force her to.

559
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:11,400
Then you're a lousy mom.
You want your daughterto be a freak.

560
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:15,720
- We're not freaks.
- You want herto overcome adversity.

561
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,010
- Yes.
- Then why stop at height?

562
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,370
Poke a stick in her eye.
Imagine how interestingshe'll be then.

563
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,140
Being little is notthe same as--

564
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:28,680
you and I have found out that
being normal sucks'cause we're freaks.

565
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,790
The advantage of being a freakis it makes your stronger.

566
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,440
Now, how strong do you reallywant her to have to be?

567
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,890
Tell her what youhave to tell her.

568
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,740
Tell her you lied.

569
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,520
Even if you didn'T.

570
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,530
This is who you weresupposed to be.

571
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,560
You hate normal.

572
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,700
It's not that simple.

573
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,090
If I grow, I'll fadeinto the background.

574
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,390
I'll be boring.

575
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,950
We'll get you a funny hat.

576
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,760
You could never be boring.

577
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,970
You want me to belike everybody else?

578
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,640
I want you to havewhat I can'T.

579
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,280
Abigail agreed--abigail agreed to takegrowth hormone.

580
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:56,750
- Who's abigail?
- your non-dwarfdwarf patient.

581
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,320
Oh, good.

582
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,310
Then the growth hormonemakes sense.

583
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,630
- Christmas eve.
- Yeah, I know.

584
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,890
Deal expires tomorrow.

585
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,990
You have plansfor tonight?

586
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,780
You worried I'm gonna bepopping more pills?

587
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,620
Thought you might preferpeople over pills.

588
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:53,750
Hey, mom.I guess you guys are
already up at aunt sarah'S.

589
00:39:54,450 --> 00:40:00,970
I'm sure dad'sin the egg nogand you're probably
suffering throughanother dried out turkey.

590
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,770
Just wanted to saymerry christmas.

591
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:43,560
house?Are you okay?
I tried calling three times.

592
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,470
Larry Zebalusky. Dr. James Wilson.
Take as needed.not to exceed 4 per day.OXYCODONE

593
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,250
I'm ready to takethe deal.

594
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,660
Well, that's off the table.

595
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,190
The clock doesn'texpire until--

596
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,400
got new evidence.
We don't needwilson anymore.

597
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:14,650
The thing about addictsis, uh...

598
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:20,950
no matterhow smart they are,
they are dumbwhen it comes to drugs.

599
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,420
So, uh, I've been keepingan eye on the pharmacy log.

600
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:34,970
Seems some patient of wilson's named zebalusky
managed to pick uphis oxy prescriptionafter he died.

601
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,520
Jesus walks, huh?

602
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,260
*So have yourself a merry little christmas now*

603
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,900
merry christmas.
