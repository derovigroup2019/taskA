1
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,280
So you want me to
explainhow you just lost?

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,740
Or do you wanna stare at the
board your full... three minutes?

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,620
Cling to hope?

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,420
Come on. It's called speed chess.

5
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,880
Na na na na

6
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,770
na na na na

7
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,810
hey hey hey

8
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,740
good-bye

9
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,400
good game.

10
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,040
I said good game.

11
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,620
Hey!Hey hey!

12
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,130
What are you doing?
Stop that,son!Stop that!

13
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,220
Back away from him. Back away!

14
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,470
Call 911.Get an ambulance!

15
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,720
Tell them to send two!

16
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,480
My head's gonna explode! Aah!

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,900
Your head still hurt?

21
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,190
You a moron?

22
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,820
Nate.

23
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,330
I'm clutching my head in
pain, and he asks if it hurts?

24
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,420
What are you, some kind of med student?

25
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,620
You look like you still
have theme birthday parties.

26
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,070
Sorry.

27
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,330
Any problems concentrating
in school lately?

28
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,800
Besides the dreams of running my tongue
along my french teacher's breasts?

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,200
No,I'm doing quite great.

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,710
The rage and pain could be caused by
a parasite. Does he eat a lot of sushi?

31
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,120
No. Uh,he was a vegetarian
until just a few months ago.

32
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
Any changes in behavior
since the new diet?

33
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,830
No.

34
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,410
He's been this way since
he became a teenager.

35
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,330
It doesn't matter how much I yell
or punish, he's still gonna say-

36
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,040
yeah,let's all shed a tear
for poor little nate's mother.

37
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,440
Any more stupid questions?

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,100
nate.

39
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,860
I hate this kid.

40
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,310
I like this kid.

41
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,710
- You haven't met hiM.
- I know you hate him.

42
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,650
What more do I need to
know? The kid's not a clich?

43
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,780
Anybody can get into
a fight after losing.

44
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,310
It takes real creativity to
beat up someone you just beat.

45
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,040
The pain's not limited to his head.

46
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,270
The rest is bumps and bruises accounted for
by the 17 fights he's been in this semester.

47
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,830
Concussion?

48
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,960
Mri was clean. No frontal lobe tumor.

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,260
And the tox screen showed no
trace of coke or amphetamines.

50
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,690
Nate went medieval on
the other kid. Could be-

51
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,880
hold on. I'm having a moment.

52
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,090
This...

53
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,020
this could be foreman's last time
mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.

54
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,230
Which could create excess adrenaline.
Causes the head pain and rage.

55
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,080
But not the personality disorder.

56
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,490
there is no personality disorder.

57
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,350
He's a teenager.

58
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,450
Being a teenager excuses the
odd inappropriate comment.

59
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,410
This kid say anything appropriate?

60
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,740
He's having cluster headaches.
Probably been having them for years.

61
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,220
Question is, what's causing them?

62
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,870
If it were just a cluster headache,
he'd have swelling around the eyes.

63
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,400
Er gave him ibuprofen for
the pain. Useless r this pain.

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,690
But it could have knocked down the
swelling. Best bet is a vascular problem.

65
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,480
Normal treatment for cluster headaches
is steroids, which the er also gave him.

66
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,120
He's still in pain. Which means-

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,900
normal treatment is called normal treatment because
sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment.

68
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,050
Start him on blood thinners and give his
noggin transcranial magnetic stimulation.

69
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,670
Don't you dare...
touch that acerbic wit.

70
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,610
50 bucks to whichever of you
steps up and treats this brat.

71
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,520
Not the kid's fault, he's sick.

72
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,180
Fine. You do it.

73
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,140
No way. He's your brat.

74
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,780
I'll do it. But I've got
a job interview after work.

75
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,030
Anything comes up later,
you guys handle it.

76
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,730
- Need a peer recommendation?
- Thanks.

77
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,040
Cameron's should suffice.

78
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,250
This isn't gonna turn me into some,like,
drooling vegetable that wets his pants,is it?

79
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,460
It's safe. The magnetic pulses activate nerve
cells which will hopefully squelch the head pain.

80
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,620
Is there anything you can
do about the other pain?

81
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,030
From the fights?

82
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,890
Yeah,I mean,my face,
my shoulder. My stomach.

83
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,790
I mean,I can barely bend my fingers.

84
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,180
You're already on pain
meds. Nothing more I can dO.

85
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,270
Sure you can,man. Tell your
homies to quit stomping on me.

86
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,190
I'll get the word out
that you're a great guy.

87
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,590
So,do people watch what
they say around you?

88
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,660
Because I'm black?

89
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,960
No,because you're gay.

90
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,620
cluster headaches can persist for years,

91
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,300
cause irritabilityor even
hostility towards others.

92
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,390
You mean,the illnessis
affecting his personality?

93
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,580
If these treatments work, it could-

94
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,850
change him?

95
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,100
Yeah.

96
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,250
Oh,thank god.

97
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,440
Oh. Oh,you must thinkI'm awful.

98
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,630
Here my son'slying
in a hospital bed and-

99
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,640
I
- I'm pretty sureI get it.

100
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,040
I thoughtI was a bad mother.

101
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,040
And I hated myself.

102
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,720
Because I hated him.

103
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,430
what have you got for
me this fine morning?

104
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,190
Blood thinners and tmshad no
effect. It's not cluster headaches.

105
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,980
You accusing the symptomsof lying?

106
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,400
Could be hemochromatosis.

107
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,210
Wouldn't accountfor the
personality disorder.

108
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,610
What about hypothyroidism?

109
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,410
He's notgetting aggressive and lethargic,he's
getting aggressive and aggressiver.

110
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,580
What aboutruptured dermoid cyst?

111
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,630
Sorry. Just got dizzy there.
I was expectingto turn right.

112
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,560
It's foreman's turnto be shot down.

113
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,110
The thingthat cameron said.

114
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,080
Way to thinkoutside the box.

115
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,780
But no fat in the ventricles.

116
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,810
It's cluster headaches.

117
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,000
normal treatment didn't work.
Abnormal treatmentdidn't work.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,860
Good point,foreman.

119
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,600
The treatments don't always
work. Symptoms never lie.

120
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,590
the only approved treatment left for
cluster headaches is brain surgery.

121
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,520
And that's not even a guarantee.

122
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,170
Back off,foreman!

123
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,890
If the approved treatment doesn't
work, we go withan unapproved treatment.

124
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,580
Hey!

125
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,490
Something on your mind?

126
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,610
Because you totallycan't tell.

127
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,560
I had a job interviewlined up
at new york mercy yesterday.

128
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,600
Hospital for manhattan'sglitterati.
Big coup. Your homies must be kvelling.

129
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,380
Didn't happen,because
apparently I called to cancel.

130
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,520
I don't remember making that call.
You think I haveneurological issue?

131
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,600
- Yes.
- Why are youjerking me around?

132
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,980
- It wasn't me.
- Yeah.

133
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,830
It was oneof the other petty,
socially repressed assesI work for.

134
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,450
Maybe it wasashton kutcher.

135
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,540
If you want me to stay,tell
me you want me to stay.

136
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,910
Would it matter? No,but it'd
bethe adult way to handle it.

137
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,070
If the adult way doesn't
work,why bother with it?

138
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,720
I've beentotally professional! Gave two
weeks notice,continued to work cases.

139
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,190
Scheduled my interviewson my own time.

140
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,510
You have no rightto
screw with my future.

141
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,750
You're gonna be all whiny during
the differentialdiagnoses,aren't you?

142
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,570
It wasn't me.

143
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,540
I only sabotage peopleI
consider worth it.

144
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,150
You are one evil,cunning woman.

145
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,770
It's a massive turn-on.

146
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,460
You girlscan gossip later.

147
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,710
What are you talking about?

148
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,640
You called new york mercy to
haveforeman's job interview killed.

149
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,280
When I said,"you girlscan gossip later,"
I was throwing you out,but in a polite way.

150
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,440
Well,I take it you're
offyour antidepressants.

151
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,480
Ah,you're deflecting.
Only I'm allowedto do that.

152
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,970
Does foremanactually think I did that?

153
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,110
No,just me. But I know somethinghe
doesn'T. I didn't do it.

154
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,180
Why would I do it?

155
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,630
- Do you want him to leave?
- No.

156
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,480
Were you planningon doing something?

157
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,820
I'm waitingfor board approval.

158
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,550
But if he takes the job, there's
nothingto be done. You had to stop him.

159
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,440
Wasn't me.

160
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,180
What are you doing?

161
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,260
Looking for a tell. Rapid
eye blink,twitch of the lips.

162
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,140
Send in nurse ungerwhen you
pass her on your way out.

163
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:24,310
Almost forgot. I need to give a 16-year-oldmagic
mushrooms to treat a cluster hdache. Is that cool?

164
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,820
Yeah,no problem.

165
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,610
I was being sarcastic.

166
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,390
Wouldn't look that wayin
the court transcript.

167
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,540
Mushrooms have psilocybinsthat
work on cluster headaches.

168
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,570
It's either that,or
cutting into his brain

169
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,430
I assume you've consideredhe could
have a psychogenic experience.

170
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,370
Possibly suffer a fitof severe paranoia.

171
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,800
Well,I have now.

172
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,270
Yeah,it's definitely betterthat the dean of medicine prescribes
it insteadof an unhinged doctor with a history of drug use.

173
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,700
Takes the stink off if the patient
decidesto put on a cape and fly off the roof.

174
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,650
Low dose. No more than ten
milligrams. Tightly controlled setting.

175
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,390
And make sure the mothersigns off on it.

176
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,570
Party on,garth. And don't standin
foreman's way. It's just wrong.

177
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,980
New research showsthat a chemical
component in the mushrooms can be-

178
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,540
yeah,lots of technicalmedical
stuff. So when do I get 'em?

179
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,270
I went to college. I
know about mushrooms.

180
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,230
A friend of a friendshot
himself in the foot.

181
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,900
They're not giving mea gun,enid!

182
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,350
Sign the consent form.

183
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,350
We'll be monitoring him, but
cardiac arrestis possible.

184
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,290
big E...

185
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,070
small N...

186
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,950
and if the mushroomsdon't work?

187
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,150
The next step would bea
type of brain surgery.

188
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,180
Oh,god.

189
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,630
Pain's gettin' worse.

190
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,440
Need 'shrooms now!

191
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:09,280
In-a-gadda-da-vida,honey

192
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,490
don't you knowthat I'm lovin' you

193
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,540
in-a-gadda-da-vida,baby...

194
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,330
oh,yeah.

195
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,440
Nate,how's the pain?

196
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,600
That I'll alwaysbe true...

197
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,620
hey,hey!It's skippy!

198
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,010
The bush kangaroo!

199
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,910
Your head,nate. We need
to knowhow the pain is.

200
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,580
What I got hereis the opposite of pain.

201
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,770
That means you're sufferingfrom cluster
headaches. Which means,hopefully-

202
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,340
Man,you're hot.

203
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,900
- She's making me horny.
- Deal with it.

204
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,670
Hey,hey,hey,hey.

205
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,930
You can't get me stoned,then
not close the deal.

206
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,920
- Shut up.
- Take it easy. He's not well.

207
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,060
You'll regret saying no.

208
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,230
Check it out.

209
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,810
Oh,for god's sake.

210
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,780
- Hold it.
- What the hell are you doing?

211
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,950
He has undersized testes.

212
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,320
His other secondary
sexualcharacteristics are normal.

213
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,070
If you wanna curry favorwith me, avoid
discussionsof other men's testicles.

214
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,540
Thanks.

215
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,800
Focus on phrases like... "you were
rightabout the cluster headaches. "

216
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,160
But wrongabout what caused them.

217
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,720
Vascular problemin a major artery
wouldn't cause hypogonadism.

218
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,570
Okay,what causes rage,headaches,personality
disorder, and hypogonadism?

219
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,090
Where's foreman?

220
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,750
He's mad at me.

221
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,300
- Why?
- No reason.

222
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,870
Yeah,that makes sense.

223
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,480
The male genitalsare controlled by
the hypothalamusand pituitary gland.

224
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,460
We're not talkingabout foreman anymore.

225
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,740
The kid's being pummeledat school.

226
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,440
A couple blows to the head
could causehypothalamic lesions.

227
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,760
We ever gonna talk aboutwhat
happens when foreman's gone?

228
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,440
If this werean employee-owned
airline in scandinavia,yes.

229
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,620
It's not lesions. His temperature wouldbe
all over the map. Symptoms don't lie.

230
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,150
He's gonein less than a week
and you haven't evenread a r?sum?

231
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,300
Doesn't even need to. The
two of uscan handle it.

232
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,350
Craniopharyngiomafits the symptoms.

233
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,530
Biopsy the brat's pituitary.

234
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,230
And let the record show I was
rightabout the cluster headaches.

235
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,800
Forget it.

236
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,350
It's a straightforwardprocedure.

237
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,350
and cut somethingout
of my brain? No way.

238
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,970
If it's a tumor,it could kill you.

239
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,710
Just give me more
'shrooms,okay? I'll be fine.

240
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,050
You only needmy consent,right?

241
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,010
Yeah,but it'llbe a lot easier if he-

242
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,540
do whateveryou have to do.

243
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,970
You don't touch me,all right? You
can touch me. Just not my brain.

244
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,950
Nate,you gotta do this.
I can't take it anymore.

245
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,310
My god,mom! Save me the
melodramatichand-wringing,okay?

246
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,850
Loosen up! Get yourself coited.

247
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,950
I'm gonna give hima sedative.

248
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,750
You're decent-looking,dr. Skippy.

249
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,980
Why don't you take herfor a ride?

250
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,880
Nate...

251
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,560
Are you in pain?

252
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,390
Nate!

253
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,920
His heart rate's normal.
Respiration's even.

254
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,610
What's happening? What's
the matter with him?

255
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,470
he's jaundiced. His
liver's shutting down.

256
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,990
we started him on sodium
polystyrene sulfonate.

257
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,760
His liver's operating at about
20% and deteriorating fast.

258
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,760
Which means he'll be dead long before
foreman turns in his parking pass.

259
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,190
So,what causespersonality
disorder, head pain,

260
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,710
blah blah blah,and liver failure?

261
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,690
Liver failurecan cause
hypogonadism, head pain.

262
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,650
Altered mental status leads to
thepersonality disorder and rage.

263
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,770
All we needto do is figure out
what causedthe liver failure.

264
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:49,790
Yes-also,we needto figure out how symptoms
yesterdaycan be caused by liver failure today.

265
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,910
If his liver's failing
now,it wasn't great yesterday.

266
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,820
If it wasn't operatingat
capacity, it could have caused-

267
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,620
ooh-aah!Whoa!

268
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,500
Don't sneak up on a personlike that.

269
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,460
I'm listening.

270
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,600
Well,listeningdoesn't help me.

271
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,200
Okay. Let's go with the
liverand a time machine theory.

272
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,720
Foreman,what causesliver problems?

273
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,180
Wilson's disease.

274
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,980
No. Ceruloplasmin's normal.

275
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,440
No enlargementand no
palpable mass, so no cancer.

276
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,900
Could be a narrowingof the bile
ducts. Primary sclerosingcholangitis.

277
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,030
Most liver damagebegins with what
we put in our bodies. Foreman?

278
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,280
Angry teen... alcohol.

279
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,130
No,blood testswere negative.

280
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,190
no signs of drug use or acetaminophen
poisoningin his tox screen.

281
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,320
Maybe the water was contaminated.

282
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,450
his mother would also be sick.

283
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,300
Cuddy?

284
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,920
Sounded like someonewith back. Go.

285
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,510
We'll tryand muddle through
without your blank stareto guide us.

286
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,130
So if it's not the bad thingshe's
putting in, what about the good things?

287
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,170
he was raised a vegetarian.

288
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,860
Was raised. Means he's all grown up.

289
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,300
Or he's nota vegetarian anymore.

290
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,160
He started eating red
meata few months ago.

291
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,860
Unless he's been buyingcuts of mad cow,

292
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,750
his body wouldhave no
problem metabolizing it.

293
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,170
It would if he hadan otc deficiency.

294
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,800
Body can'tmetabolize
nitrogen, damages the liver.

295
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,100
Run a hamburger test.

296
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,380
It's exactlywhat it sounds
like. Stuff him full of meat,

297
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,250
wait for his ammonia levelsto spike.

298
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,140
I'll double your salary.

299
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,460
Chase and cameronwould
mutiny if they found out.

300
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,570
Chase and cameronwouldn't be heading
up their own diagnostic group.

301
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,960
You'll work in parallelwith
house. It'll be your practice.

302
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,950
Separate staff,separate
cases. Complete autonomy.

303
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,000
I've only been doing
thisfor three years.

304
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,690
Three years under house.
No better training.

305
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,430
And when that case comes
alongthat I can't figure out?

306
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,740
You knowwho I'd have to go to.

307
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,630
Or you canjust let that patient
die. That's completelyup to you.

308
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,670
No.

309
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,740
Why?

310
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,280
He's evil.

311
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,480
He didn't sabotageyour interview.

312
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,530
How do you know?

313
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,980
Because I did.

314
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,420
I didn'T.

315
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,910
You believed me-meansyou're
not sure house did it.

316
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,150
Well,somebody did it.

317
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,170
Somebody here did it.

318
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,570
I can't work here.

319
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,740
This isn'ta medical procedure.

320
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,640
This is just about
doogiemaking me eat garbage.

321
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,630
Need to seehow your liver
processes the proteins.

322
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,340
Then get me a steak,some roast beef.

323
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,730
What if I brought
himsomething from home?

324
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,310
It has to be prepared here
so we knowthere's no chemicals

325
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,120
or preservatives that
couldaffect the test results.

326
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,740
I'm not eatinganything prepared by $5-an-hour
immigrant hospital cooks in hairnets.

327
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,440
Shut up!

328
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,970
Either you start eating,

329
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,510
or I'm gonnastrap you to this bed
and shove thesedown your throat

330
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,590
one by one-got it?

331
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,040
You can't get mad at me.

332
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,960
I'm sick.

333
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,520
You're supposedto feel bad for me.

334
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,620
- Nurse,full setof body restraints.
- yes,doctor.

335
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,790
Trust me.

336
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,200
It'll be a lot less
messyif you do it yourself.

337
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,850
You killedforeman's job interview.

338
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,310
- Why would I-
- somebody did.

339
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,560
Wasn't me,and it wasn't house, which means it hasto
be somebody who thoughthe was protecting house.

340
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,760
Which means it hasto be somebody
who actually likes house.

341
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,720
Which meansit's either you or the weird
night janitor who wearshis pants backwards.

342
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,170
I want foreman to leave.

343
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,850
House has to realizehe needs
someone who stands up to him.

344
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,810
Cameron's in love with him,chase
is afraid of him, and I enable him.

345
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,300
- House needs
limits. - I give him-

346
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,780
you authorizemagic mushrooms.

347
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,380
House is a six-year-oldwho thinks
he's better off without parents.

348
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,210
A few tummy achesafter dinners of ice
cream and ketchupmight do him some good.

349
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,660
You're lying.

350
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,500
An enablerdoesn't conspire
against, an enabler enables.

351
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,930
What?

352
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,870
You're paranoid.

353
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,550
You made that call.

354
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:49,130
And because of that call, you bacally
guaranteedforeman's out of here.

355
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,940
I thought it would be funto
work on my boat with him.

356
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,190
And you went shirtlessbecause
skin cancer looks cool.

357
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,410
Well,I realizeI got burnt.
I'm not too worriedabout that.

358
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,820
It's these white marks,you know?

359
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,890
Lie down.

360
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,740
I mean,that boathas
all sorts of lead paint,

361
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,250
and there's chemicalseverywhere.

362
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,440
when daddy works on his boat,

363
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,470
does he have a coolerwith lots
of brown bottles with long necks?

364
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,090
And does daddy like to lie down on
his boat and go nap-nap in the sun?

365
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,920
Oh!What-what the hell?

366
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,310
I will give you this for the...

367
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,540
$1.41 in your pocket.

368
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,520
Wait,how could you know...

369
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,270
a psychic once told methat I'm psychic.

370
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,730
Hey,one of these quartersis canadian.

371
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,430
Give me backmy syringe.

372
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,120
Hamburger stress testshowed no
change in his ammonia levels.

373
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,590
Liver's properly convertingthe
ammonia into urea.

374
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,530
He doesn't haveotc deficiency.

375
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,610
Welcome back.

376
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,010
Sorry. I shouldn't have beentaking
my problems out on the patient.

377
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,280
Or on me. Apology accepted.

378
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,630
- Starve him.
- What are we looking for?

379
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,910
Diabetic steatosiswould
screw up his liver.

380
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,640
Starve him overnightand
see if his blood sugar pops.

381
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,810
We mess with his blood sugar,we
could set off another rage.

382
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,900
Not a problem. You can take him.

383
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,330
I want something to eat!

384
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,010
- Honey,please don'T.

385
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,570
I was just tryingto get a
urine sample, and he went crazy.

386
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,410
I need to eat!

387
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,170
You're not stickinganything else in me.

388
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,860
It's justa few more hours.

389
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,100
You're gonna hurt yourself.

390
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,110
I'm gonna hurt you!

391
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,460
As soon aswe get a urine
sample, we can leave you alone.

392
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,840
You want your sample?
Here's your damn sample!

393
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,680
Nate,don'T.

394
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,270
Oh,my god.

395
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,470
Nate,you needto get
back into bed. Right now.

396
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:26,010
chem panel and urinalysis confirms the
bloody urine was caused by kidney failure.

397
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,980
He's on dialysis. He's gonna
need itfor the rest of his life.

398
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,100
Which is shorteningas we speak.

399
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,240
We are lookingat a chinese menu, and
we've got symptomsfrom too many columns.

400
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,040
They're goingto overcharge us.

401
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,020
Multiple organ failurecould
mean primary hiv infection.

402
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,350
That would meansomeone
agreed to sleep with him.

403
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,920
Plus his serologyis negative.

404
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,560
His uric acid'sslightly elevated.

405
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,770
10% of malesin this
country have elevated-

406
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,710
so we're onlygonna pay attention
to abnormal abnormalities?

407
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,340
We've been stuffing himwith meat and his
kidneys are shot. Of course his uric acid-

408
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,240
could be hepatic fibrosisor mcadd.

409
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,700
The brat'sgot a genetic disorder.

410
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,940
Get the sequencing primers. See if
it's oneof the ones we can treat.

411
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,650
I can draw some blood,but
then I gotta run.

412
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,900
Job interview?

413
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,830
You gonna stop meif it is?

414
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,340
You do the nurse stuff,they'll
do the doctor stuff.

415
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,130
This a blood testfor a marriage license?

416
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,870
Plan on kidnapping meto
massachusetts or canad...

417
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,680
what did you give him?

418
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,470
Are you treating himfor something?

419
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,200
Sedative.

420
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,000
Did he need a sedative?

421
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,720
I did. Just shutting him upso I
can draw some of his bloodin peace.

422
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,770
You walked in with that. You
didn't even give him a chance.

423
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,930
People are what they are.

424
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,450
He's sick.

425
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,850
The rudenessisn't his fault.

426
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,500
If he had tuberculosis, it
wouldn'tbe his fault either.

427
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,260
But I still wouldn't let himcough on me.

428
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,560
- Hi.
- Hey.

429
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,210
where are you going?

430
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,830
The lab. We're testingour
patient's blood for hereditary-

431
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,940
cuddy thinks I
sabotagedforeman's interview.

432
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,090
She's gonna fire me.

433
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,270
I don't believe it.

434
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,380
She saidit was unprofessional and-

435
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,270
no,I mean I literally don't believe it.

436
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,170
Cuddy wouldn't fire
youfor something like that.

437
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,440
Which means eithershe lied to you,

438
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,720
or you're lying to me.

439
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,620
You so would havefallen
for that three years ago.

440
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,540
You werelooking for a reaction. You
were looking for meto feel bad for you.

441
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,100
To save your skin. But
how am I gonna save you?

442
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,030
Unless...

443
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,200
you think I'm the onewho really did it.

444
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,420
Cuddy's logic wasforeman's
valuable to house.

445
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,000
I care about house. Ergo,I
woulddo anything to save him.

446
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,520
And your logic was... I care about
houseas much as you do, ergo...

447
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,890
it wasn't me.

448
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,880
I don't care about house.

449
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,550
I don't believe you.

450
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,560
No one does.

451
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,500
House is nothing morethan my boss.

452
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,910
Foreman's nothing morethan a colleague.

453
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,040
You're lying.

454
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,790
Everyone does. But it wasn't me.

455
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,870
No markersfor hepatic fibrosis.

456
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,740
And nothing for mcadd.

457
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,930
Foreman's interview in
new yorkgot screwed up.

458
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,230
I heard.

459
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,510
Foreman thought it was house,
house thought it was cuddy.

460
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,570
Cuddy thought it was
wilson,wilson thought it was me.

461
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,430
And you think it was me?

462
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,900
You thinkI sabotaged foreman?

463
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,760
- I don't evenwant him here.
- I know.

464
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,950
Then why wouldI do-

465
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,610
I think you sabotaged foreman
just to sabotage foreman.

466
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,710
So everyone's a suspect because
everyonewants to help house. Except for me.

467
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,890
I'm a suspectbecause I'm
a petty, vindictive jerk?

468
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,300
You actually thinkI would
do something like that?

469
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,560
- It was someone.
- It wasn't me.

470
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,990
Negativefor von gierke disease.

471
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,110
And it's tuesday.

472
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,500
I know.

473
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,130
I like you.

474
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,230
I know.

475
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,350
See you next tuesday.

476
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,600
Found something.

477
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,830
He's got a partialhprt
enzyme deficiency.

478
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,180
Means he could
havekelley-seegmiller syndrome.

479
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,610
But it'sa partial deficiency. So
it may notbe kelley-seegmiller.

480
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,540
Yes. Those arethe two
options. It is or it isn'T.

481
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,770
Kelley-seegmiller explainsthe
aggressive personality.

482
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,240
If he d kelley-seegmiller, he wouldn't
just be aggressive, he'd be self-mutilating.

483
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,080
Chewing his lips,banging his head.

484
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,550
Lovely disease.
Degenerative,fatal,incurable.

485
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,810
I wonder if that's
whycameron's on the "not" side.

486
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,220
That and the factthat
symptoms don't lie.

487
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,280
kelley-seegmiller carriers
self-mutilatewhen they're stressed.

488
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,010
He's in the icuwith a
failing liver and no kidneys.

489
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,580
Yeah,his life is sweet.

490
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,230
His vegetarian dietcould have
limited the purines in his system,

491
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,240
slowingthe disease's progress.

492
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,980
- So let's speed it up.
- Why?

493
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,280
So you two kidswill stop fighting.

494
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,840
Also,I don't feel likewaiting
for respiratory failurE.

495
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,960
Chase,find some wayfor the
mother to get lost for a while.

496
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,310
I'm going to stress this
kiduntil he bites off a finger.

497
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,370
They move me to geriatrics? Who are you?

498
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,480
Dr. MccaneY.

499
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,250
The man who's gonnakick your
ass all over this chessboard.

500
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,570
- Yeah,well,I'm too weak
to- - bite yourself,yeah.

501
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,640
You need some liquid energy.

502
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,170
Now,if you consent,I'm gonna
give you this shot of adrenaline.

503
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,850
I don't wanna play.

504
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,980
Aside frombeing indicative of pituitary
issuesand certain kinds of genetic disorders,

505
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,930
small testiclesalso indicate...

506
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,540
that you'ra big chicken.

507
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,280
Please don't make medo the sound effect.

508
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,700
You're not gonnagoad me into playing.

509
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,320
Didn't think I'd have to.

510
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,140
Thought you'd justjump at the
chance of humiliating someone.

511
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,340
Age before cripple.

512
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,840
I'm white.

513
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,710
It... is... on!

514
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,270
Bird's opening. Passive approach.

515
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,210
Sign of a coward.

516
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,170
Sicilian defense. Sign of an idiot.

517
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,880
Arrogance has to be earned.

518
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,990
Tell me what you've doneto earn yours.

519
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,220
I can walk.

520
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,950
I don't bleedout of my penis.

521
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,930
Check.

522
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,790
You know,it's a real thin
line between tortured genius

523
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,840
and awkward kid who can't
get girls because he's creepy.

524
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,840
Why are you doing this?

525
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,510
To stress you out.

526
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,460
Check.

527
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,480
Yeah,but why?

528
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,210
I'd tell you,but I figureit's more
stressful if you don't know why.

529
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,070
Yeah,well... I'm not
feeling too stressed.

530
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,700
You knowthat no one likes you,right?

531
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,260
Yeah,well,anybody like you?

532
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,590
You're dying.

533
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,100
Check.

534
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,380
Your move.

535
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,830
Care to lay down your king?

536
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,620
You can't win.

537
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,960
You can pin my queen.

538
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,390
My knight to e7. Your king to h8.

539
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,400
Sacrifice rook takes pawn.

540
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,030
Bishop blocks. Queen to h5. Checkmate.

541
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,360
Save what's leftof your dignity.

542
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,260
Lay down your king.

543
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
Crap.

544
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,670
he's having a seizure.

545
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,240
- Four milligramsiv lorazepam.
- Right away.

546
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,860
I hate this kid.

547
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,650
I like this kid.

548
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,260
Did you get the job?

549
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,790
They're gonna let me know.

550
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,890
Kelley-seegmillerdidn't
cause this seizure.

551
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:35,960
So we've gotone more
symptom, one less diagnosis.

552
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,830
I assume they're gonnacall for
references? Did you give 'em my name?

553
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,810
No.

554
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,930
Amyloidosis can cause seizures, and the
protein buildupcould causorgan failure.

555
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,520
Wouldn't alterhis personality.

556
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,090
Whose name did you give?

557
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,430
My last boss.

558
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,760
Ouch. That can't look good.

559
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,650
I hate this kid.

560
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,270
What if we're notdealing with one
condition? What ifit's multiple conditions?

561
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,350
Uh-uh,it's gotta be
one. It's always one.

562
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,820
Nothing explainsthis
constellation of symptoms.

563
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,960
We've gotta be missing something.
Maybe the kidlied about some medication.

564
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,910
Maybe he's hiding something.

565
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,740
- Why wouldhe be hiding something?
- I don't know,because he's evil?

566
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,070
What if he is?

567
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,550
What ifthe symptoms lied?

568
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,850
There.

569
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,870
Now all we're looking at is a
simple,evil jerkwith amyloidosis.

570
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,430
You're not being objective.

571
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,750
Amyloidosis was your idea.

572
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,320
You were right,it
doesn't fit the symptoms.

573
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,570
Yeah,it does.

574
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,060
Look.

575
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,420
You crossed it off because
you wannahate the kid.

576
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,050
And you can't hate himif he's a victim-

577
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,070
you want himto be a victim because
you wanna believethat people are good.

578
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,430
And if they're not, it's
gottabe a chemical problem.

579
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,180
Except they're not,and it's not.

580
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,110
Flush himwith immunosuppressants,

581
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:54,230
get a biopsy to confirm,
and find hima marrow donor.

582
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,050
what will happen to him?

583
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:08,130
substances called amyloid proteins
build upin the body's organs,

584
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,190
shutting them down.

585
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,380
It's a fairly rare disease.
And I'm afraidit can be fatal.

586
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:22,510
So do you operateor
something to take them out?

587
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,960
He needsa bone marrow transplant.

588
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,530
Dr. Cameron is searchingthe donor bank.

589
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,220
We should test youas well.

590
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:39,120
when you first told me he was sick...

591
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,440
I was... happy.

592
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,910
Relied.

593
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,640
Now...

594
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,900
nate,I'm gonna takea small
piece of nerve from your ankle.

595
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,090
Let me knowif you feel any pain.

596
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,380
I'm burning up.

597
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,830
Couldn't you justknock me
out like you did last time?

598
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,380
Wish I could. But your
bodyhas to be clear

599
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,570
so it's readyfor a marrow transplant.

600
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,030
hey,dr. X...

601
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:18,210
I know you've busted
asstrying to save me.

602
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,550
It's all right.

603
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,210
I wasn't gonna thank you.

604
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:27,610
I was gonna tell youyou
really suck at this.

605
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,790
We're doing our best.

606
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,780
That's sort of my point.

607
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,090
Your best really sucks.

608
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,490
Nerve biopsy was clean.

609
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,450
No evidence of amyloidosis.

610
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,710
It was your idea. Don't
give up on itso fast.

611
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,720
He's running a fever. If it's two conditions,
one of them'sgotta be an infection.

612
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,350
We should start himon antibiotics,
see what clears up,what doesn'T.

613
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,620
Is he having troublebreathing?

614
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,660
Yeah,he has mucusin his
chest from an infection.

615
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,660
Could alsobe an amyloid buildup.

616
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,480
Keep him on immunosuppressantsand
biopsy somewhere else, his sinuses.

617
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,290
Look,you got two choices.

618
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:12,700
Engage me in a futile argumentthen do
what I asked, or just do what I asked.

619
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,290
You're not ready.

620
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:23,320
There was a third choice.
Don't do what I asked.

621
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,320
You could have defied me,stuck the
kid on antibiotics. But you didn'T.

622
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,740
Because you stilltrust my
judgment more than your own.

623
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,260
You sabotagedforeman's
job interview, didn't you?

624
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:05,130
Foreman's alreadybeen
over this. It wasn't me.

625
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,760
Everybody's chasing ghostsover this.

626
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,350
Which meanseither nobody did it, or
somebody wants everybodychasing ghosts.

627
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,410
Now,who does that sound like?

628
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,730
And why would I do that?

629
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,860
Because as long as
foremanthought you were guilty,

630
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,740
he was gonnabe useless around here.

631
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:30,130
You know,sometimes I
forgetwhy I hired you.

632
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,480
You cost hima good
opportunity and gained nothing.

633
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,390
I cost hima crappy opportunity.

634
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:41,160
New york mercy'swhere you go to
treat boils and cystsand build a 401k.

635
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,550
If you want him to stay,tell him.

636
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,430
I don'T.And there'd be no point.

637
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,170
You do.

638
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,910
And the point wouldbe to make
him feel like he's wanted.

639
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,400
He doesn't need that.

640
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,050
All right,then. It'd make him
feellike maybe you weren't evil.

641
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,620
He needs that.

642
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,760
Talk to foreman.

643
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,580
We dumped one symptom.

644
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,140
But forgot to add one.

645
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,290
Revenge time,nate.

646
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,980
- Are you...
- yes! I am.

647
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,150
Black or white?

648
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,940
Just limp away.

649
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,760
He doesn't wanna play. Leave him alone.

650
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,840
Pick one,or this comes out.

651
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,890
And for all you know,this
is really important.

652
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,410
Ow!Stop it!

653
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,020
That hurts,right?

654
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,660
Which is odd, because
I'm reallyenjoying this.

655
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,190
You hold the piecesthat way
because you can'tbend your thumb.

656
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,120
Because your boneshave
formed abnormally.

657
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,010
Thanks to all the crap that's been
pushing its wayin between them.

658
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,540
Actually,this stuffisn't
important at all.

659
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,940
Your doctors saidhe
needs immunosuppressants.

660
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,130
They're idiots. It's not amyloidosis.

661
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:16,230
It's iron. He's got hemochromatosis.

662
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,760
The body absorbs iron from food, but
can't process it. Can't get rid of it.

663
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,610
And idle iron is the devil's playground.

664
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,860
It builds up in the organs and joints,

665
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,830
whacking them in the process.

666
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,590
Caused all of the symptoms.

667
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,470
Including somethingthat
wasn't a symptom.

668
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,750
Those body aches,they
were notfrom the fighting.

669
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,900
His personality issues?

670
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,180
Sorry.

671
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,000
The iron's innocenton that count.

672
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,160
Your kid's a jerk. And
yeah,it's probably your fault.

673
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,270
Although,if you'd stayed off
the meat like your mom said,

674
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:54,670
you'd havehalf as much iron,
and be twice lessalmost dead.

675
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,580
Oh,nurse!

676
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,570
This patient is bleedingfor some reason.

677
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,930
Is he going to be okay?

678
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,680
He'll need dialysis.

679
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,090
And he'll haveto get his blood drained
every few monthsfor the rest of his life.

680
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:18,110
But my condolences. It's going
to be a longand annoying life.

681
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,140
And I wouldn'thave taken your bishop.

682
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,880
I'd have moved my queen
to d6,defusing the threat.

683
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,470
Then rook to e8,attacking
the king's pawn.

684
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,010
I'd have lost the
exchange,but won the game.

685
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,010
I know.

686
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,770
I was bluffing.

687
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,700
And that's why...

688
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,500
You lost.

689
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,050
Little jerk.

690
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:12,000
You just here to watch,or
you got something to say?

691
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,790
Still runningthe new
biopsy for amyloidosis?

692
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,500
Yeah,but still nothing.

693
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,230
Run the test again.
Recheck your results.

694
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:38,060
Looks like you're infor an all-nighter.
