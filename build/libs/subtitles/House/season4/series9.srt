1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,865
Roman emperors 
were real punks

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,750
- Don't say "punk. " It's cliche.
- Whatever.

3
00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:17,600
Let me tell you about 
these dinner parties.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,300
Nero loved a good poisoning.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,300
At a dinner party?

6
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:21,065
He'd arrange one...

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,600
I don't feel like going on tonight.

8
00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:23,700
Too bad.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,800
'Cause that's what 
makes the club

10
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:25,965
Feel like paying us.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,465
Titus-This is all in the book.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,250
Titus would ply his 
guests with wine,

13
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:31,000
Then bind their privates with a cord.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,500
Hey!

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,700
Did you get a new guitar?

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,800
'64 teardrop re-Issue.

17
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:38,200
Not a mark on it.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,800
All right.

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,500
Let's see it.

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,900
Yeah,it's nice.

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,365
Hey! Hey! Hey!

22
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,565
Hey,cut it out,man!

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
You stupid son of a- 
Come on! Hey!

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,465
It's a hunk of wood,bro!

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,800
It should look like a hunk of wood.

26
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,700
We're not the philharmonic.

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,700
See,look,man, 
it's better already.

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,765
Hey! It's 10:45.

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,500
How 'bout taking that onstage?

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
Now i feel like going on.

31
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,710
HOUSE MD 
Season 04 Episode 09

32
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,700
You're my child, 
and so are the quadruplets.

33
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:44,100
And i'm not gonna 
give any of you up.

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,965
Don't you dare talk to 
me as a mother.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,600
Sign on the door says
"Closed for private event. "

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,700
You're alone.

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,800
How much more 
private can you get?

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,200
Can you pass me a tissue?

39
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:57,165
Who are you keeping?

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,300
You owed me a 
decision ten days ago.

41
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:00,065
Total amnesia.

42
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,900
Nearly took away the
only parent you ever had.

43
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:05,500
You're my whole life. You.

44
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,765
Luisa maria can't decide

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
If she's gonna 
keep the quadruplets.

46
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,050
She keeps them.

47
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:13,965
I read it online.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,365
You happy now? 
I ruined it for you.

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,265
- I want two names by friday. 
- Fine.

50
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,300
I'll arrange for a patient
with a mysterious illness

51
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:21,165
To come in on thursday.

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,000
<i>Yes,you need more tests.</i>

53
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,765
It's only been two months.

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,000
Who knows how they'll
react to freak weather patterns?

55
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:28,600
They all did fine in the wind tunnel.

56
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,000
Two names by friday,

57
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,100
Or the pay overruns 
come out of your salary.

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,200
<i>I can hurt you.</i>

59
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,900
I know that now.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,600
And i move your
parking space to the "E" lot.

61
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,200
<i>Don't ever leave me,mom.</i>

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,100
Hey,who's the sickest 
patient you've got?

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,300
I've got a guy who'll be
dead in the next ten minutes.

64
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,700
Oh,you mean someone who might
actually survive a diagnosis.

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,365
There's nothing here.

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,750
Just the usual cracked heads,
gunshots,false alarms.

67
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:08,100
Who would you pick to
fill your narrow little flats?

68
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:10,700
So you can fire them off
of my recommendation?

69
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
Nice try.

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,365
<i>Hey,who do i have to grope</i>

71
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,300
To get some turn-down 
service in here?

72
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:17,265
Jimmy quidd.

73
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,050
He is a punk rock singer.

74
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:20,800
Punk rock star to you.

75
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:21,765
Repeated trauma,

76
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,965
Self-Cutting,fever, arthralgia,

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,700
Hyper-Inflated chest, 
fatigue,anemia.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,765
Blood in the stool and urine.

79
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,000
I've died and gone to 
diagnostic heaven.

80
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:34,200
His blood results show 
booze,cocaine,

81
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,565
<i>Amphetamines,opiates.</i>

82
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,700
The only mystery here is
how he made it to be 38.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,965
I'm 28.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And he lies.

85
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,200
And he's a pain in the ass.

86
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,200
- Hey,come- - Wrap him up.

87
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,400
I'll take him to go.

88
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,500
Dizzying array of symptoms.

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,300
Any of which could be caused
by drugs,trauma,being a loser.

90
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,800
The guy's a walking pharmacy.
Could be anything.

91
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,700
Oh,forgot to mention...

92
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,500
Final case.

93
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,400
Get it right,you're hired.

94
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,500
<i>Runner-Up will be 
decided strictly</i>

95
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:10,100
On some definition of merit.

96
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:10,865
Endocarditis.

97
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,300
Hemorrhagic lesions in 
the lungs and gut.

98
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:13,465
<i>Bronchiolitis obliterans.</i>

99
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,950
He smoked his airways into oblivion.

100
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:16,342
- Endocarditis. 
- I already said that.

101
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:17,700
I'd heard of it before 
you mentioned it.

102
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,317
Speed counts. 
Find something else.

103
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,865
Could be bacterial meningitis.

104
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,700
- You already picked.
- I'll take meningitis.

105
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:24,500
Too late. Go run your tests.

106
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,965
No,he's sick 'cause 
he's a drug addict.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No,he has every symptom
you'd expect of a drug addict.

108
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:34,065
So you think it's all too perfect?

109
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,200
Some other disease is trying
to throw us off its trail?

110
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,900
If he had 4 out of 20 
possible symptoms,

111
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:40,800
He'd be a garden-Variety druggie.

112
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,200
20 out of 20, there's an 
underlying disease.

113
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:44,100
Run your tests.

114
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,000
<i>No.</i>

115
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
He's weak,in withdrawal, 
just spewed blood.

116
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,300
They're gonna rip off a 
piece of his lung,

117
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:51,917
Ram instruments down his throat,

118
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,500
<i>And roto-Rooter his intestines.</i>

119
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,565
It'd be nice if we didn't kill him

120
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,200
Trying to figure out what's killing him.

121
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,300
One diagnosis, one test at a time.

122
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:04,165
O2 stats are low.

123
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Hyper-Inflated chest.
I need a bronchoscopy to-

124
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:08,165
- You just lost two points. 
- What for?

125
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,400
For thinking it makes a
difference who goes first.

126
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,900
Only one person can be right.

127
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,865
What points?

128
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,700
Can't have an objective system
of measurement without numbers.

129
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,600
You lose three for not knowing that.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,900
From now on,only the 
person holding this

131
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,300
Can treat or run tests.

132
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,665
I wanted to give you the serpent staff

133
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,000
With the poison axe head,
but i left it in my car.

134
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,265
Don't need you.

135
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,900
It's one thing to hire based on a game.

136
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,265
Don't need your lecture.

137
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,400
It's insane to treat based on a game.

138
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,300
You're not taking the long view.

139
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,700
The one where we stuff
another patient in a body bag?

140
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:51,965
No,if we're wrong, 
it'll come pretty fast.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,200
The long view is the one
where we pick the best team.

142
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,100
That way we can use all 
the bags we save

143
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:57,300
For grocery shopping.

144
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,300
- You're not buying that argument,are you?
- No.

145
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,800
In which case,i'm back
to my original position.

146
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:04,800
Don't need you.

147
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,300
What do you think of amber?

148
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,300
I screwed up a diagnosis.

149
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
You don't seem that upset by it.

150
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,700
Diagnosed a guy with 
adenocarcinoma

151
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:30,600
Three months ago.

152
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,465
Told him he had six months.

153
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,100
So now you've got to tell
him that he's way behind

154
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:35,400
On his christmas shopping.

155
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:36,800
He didn't get worse.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,500
I re-Checked everything.

157
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,900
Biopsy was a false positive.

158
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,600
Harmless lesions

159
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,065
Cause by talc inhalation.

160
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,500
Medical clemency. Interesting.

161
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,700
Why would you use that word?

162
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,600
Because i'm interested.

163
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,765
When i'm interested,

164
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,500
I describe the things
that make me interested

165
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:55,465
As interesting.

166
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Most people would say 
good, possibly great.

167
00:07:58,535 --> 00:07:59,665
Why aren't you able to just enjoy-

168
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,000
Why aren't other people
able to just be interested?

169
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,500
- Is he in there? 
- Yeah.

170
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,200
Why'd you go right for 
the drug theories?

171
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,200
If he had a history of
shoving cancer into his veins,

172
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:19,100
I'd have guessed cancer.

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay. 
You're an idiot.

174
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,200
Either that or you've decided
you can trust a smoking addict

175
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,400
Alone in a bathroom 
with an oxygen tank.

176
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,500
I got your new test results back.

177
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
Sorry i'm late.

178
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Who's your colleague?

179
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,100
Dr. House...

180
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:46,300
Yes,Dr. Wilson?

181
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,500
I really don't need the consult.

182
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,900
I know the prognosis.

183
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,400
Apparently not.

184
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Mr. Mckenna,

185
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,800
I can't believe i'm able to say this,

186
00:08:57,835 --> 00:09:01,000
But... you're cancer-Free.

187
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,500
The biopsy looked like 
adenocarcinoma,

188
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:04,365
But it wasn't.

189
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Harmless lesions on your lungs.

190
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:07,100
You're fine.

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,300
I don't get it.

192
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,965
Cool.

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,500
No,it's-It's-

194
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,000
I know this must come as a shock,

195
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,567
But i've double-checked the labs.

196
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:26,100
I just accepted an offer 
on my house.

197
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,300
<i>I've had three 
good-bye parties.</i>

198
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,400
I'm buying plane tickets to venice.

199
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,100
You can still use those if you're alive.

200
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,700
I have to pay a $6,000 
broker commission

201
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,500
On a house i'm not selling.

202
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,700
Money i don't have.

203
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,500
Thank you... for letting me know.

204
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,300
I- I-I would have thought
the living would mean more

205
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:01,000
Than the expenses.

206
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,400
It's not about the money.

207
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,565
I have 17 points?

208
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,400
I started you all out on 100.

209
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,000
And you blew up part of the building.

210
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Where's foreman?

211
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,165
- He got paged. - By who?

212
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,565
- Is it about our-
- By me.

213
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,100
I needed him right away. 
Somewhere else.

214
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:25,600
We're hiding from foreman?

215
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,400
Foreman accused me of 
playing games

216
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:29,265
With patient care.

217
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,200
- Who gets the eyeball next?
- I haven't run my test yet.

218
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:33,100
- It still might be a lung issue.
- You can't run your test.

219
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:34,865
The patient had massive 
smoke inhalation.

220
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,100
Do a bronchoscopy, it'll
set off a laryngospasm.

221
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:38,465
I'll do an open-Lung biopsy instead.

222
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,700
You want an invasive surgery
because you screwed up?

223
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:42,400
The patient snuck a cigarette.

224
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:43,665
The patient is an addict.

225
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,765
<i>It's not his fault he's jonesing</i>

226
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,300
For whatever he can get his hands on.

227
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:48,200
Not his fault he's jonesing?

228
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,900
In what universe does that 
make any sense?

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,500
Get him on a nicotine patch.

230
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
It'll keep up with his joneses.

231
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Do your biopsy.

232
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,100
How's the new us's 
final case going?

233
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,600
It's a moving target.

234
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
House keeps moving it 
so i can't find it.

235
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,000
So... you've decided to focus
on solving the problem in darfur.

236
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,100
Taub is in there prepping the patient

237
00:11:19,135 --> 00:11:19,965
For a biopsy.

238
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,300
Stay close to taub, 
or stay close to house.

239
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,400
And stay close to the game.

240
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,700
I'm trying to stop the game.

241
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
That's your role in the game.

242
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
You wander over here to annoy me?

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,200
You're not wearing a lab coat.

244
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,700
House doesn't wear one, does he?

245
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,600
Damn!

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,065
Now when i walk away,

247
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,200
It's gonna look like i have a reason

248
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:40,600
Other than just annoyance.

249
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,600
He won't let us finish
prepping him for the biopsy.

250
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,000
You try the other arm?

251
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,700
The problem's not the arm,
it's the entire patient.

252
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,900
Hi.

253
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,500
He let you check his chest.

254
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
He let you do anything
except check that arm.

255
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,000
He wallpapered himself
with nicotine patches.

256
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,765
Real rebellion has a point.

257
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,100
It's not juvenile and purposeless.

258
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,400
Maybe purposelessness 
is my purpose.

259
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,065
Mission accomplished.

260
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,865
Amber... it's not the patches.

261
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,800
He's got blood clots
moving through his body.

262
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,000
Means...

263
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,900
I was wrong.

264
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,400
Oh.

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,500
If a clot reaches his lungs
or his heart,it'll kill him.

266
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,500
- It's true. 
- We all know it's true.

267
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,765
You just wasted our time.

268
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
- And what you're doing?
- I'm not competing.

269
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,500
- Where's taub? 
- Foreman was following him.

270
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:57,600
So you paged taub.

271
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,200
Didn't see that i had much choice.

272
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,600
He has schistocytes in his blood smear.

273
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,600
Which means the D.I.C.'s causing clotting.

274
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:06,000
What's causing the DIC.?

275
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,017
Drug impurities.

276
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:07,965
You lost your round.

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
New symptom,new round.
This has to be drug related.

278
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:11,265
This is how doctors kill patients.

279
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,400
By seeing the stereotype
instead of the truth.

280
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:14,700
Drug addicts use drugs 
is a stereotype?

281
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:16,800
Drugs are bad is a stereotype?

282
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:18,800
Losers lose is- Malaria.

283
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,400
He hasn't left the country in years.

284
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:21,800
<i>Malaria's relapsing/recurring.</i>

285
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,800
For all we know he could
have been sick for years.

286
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,800
It explains not just the DIC
And the bleeding,

287
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:27,165
But the tiredness,fever.

288
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,500
Everything we attributed to drugs.

289
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:29,765
Oh,yeah, it's much more likely

290
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,200
That this ass punk rocker
was exposed to malaria

291
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,265
Than drugs?

292
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,600
If you were always right,

293
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,350
<i>Then you wouldn't 
have just been wrong.</i>

294
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:39,000
Or let the patient mainline nicotine.

295
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,865
<i>Or ravaged my 
anatomical model,</i>

296
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,500
Which grandma house bought
me when i aced my mcats.

297
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:46,100
A pharmaceutical rep
left that here on tuesday.

298
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,050
Grandma does some part-Time work.

299
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:49,900
The rep was a 30-something babe.

300
00:13:49,935 --> 00:13:51,800
Thank you. I got her hips.

301
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,400
Carry it with pride.

302
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
<i>Manipulative bitch, 
you're wanted</i>

303
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,100
In the loser's circle.

304
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,000
Why do you hate drug addicts?

305
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,765
Your situation is different.

306
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,000
You're taking a necessary prescription.

307
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:11,000
I know... i'm fabulous.

308
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,165
And i'm not the patient.

309
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm not allowed to have
a problem with junkies?

310
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:15,000
You're allowed.

311
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
There's gotta be a reason.

312
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
He's a patient. 
You don't know him.

313
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,400
But you hate him.

314
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,000
He's throwing his life away.

315
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,300
'Cause he's setting his own terms?

316
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Not living in fear of every pop quiz?

317
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,200
I thought we were talking about him.

318
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,600
We were never talking about him.

319
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,600
Why are you afraid to lose?

320
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,600
Are you gonna fire me 
because i like to win?

321
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,100
Just want to know the reason.

322
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,300
I watched this football game once.

323
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,700
<i>And i noticed something odd.</i>

324
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,700
The winning team was the happy one.

325
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,200
I did the math.

326
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,800
Our patient's happy.

327
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,365
He's an idiot.

328
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,000
He's a happy idiot.

329
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,100
That screws with your world view.

330
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,600
There's something freeing
about being a loser,isn't there?

331
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,365
Why are you afraid-

332
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,800
Mommy didn't love me enough.

333
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,700
Daddy expected too much from me.

334
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,600
Something!

335
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,965
Let's assume that's true.

336
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,600
I get how that can make
me a screwed-Up person.

337
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,700
But how is my willingness 
to do anything

338
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:26,217
To get the right answer

339
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:27,700
Bad for my patients?

340
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,000
Or put in terms you can understand,

341
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,900
How is it bad for you?

342
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,950
<i>I didn't ask you to 
pick up the meds.</i>

343
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,242
I'm trying to be a good colleague.

344
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:47,688
You're trying to boost your score

345
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:49,065
By prescribing drugs for house.

346
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,450
Why else would you 
have a second bag?

347
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:51,742
Didn't say good colleague to you.

348
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:53,000
You realize we still have a patient.

349
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,100
Don't care about the patient.

350
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,065
Do you care about this job

351
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,300
More than you care about his life?

352
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:57,065
I care about my wallpaper

353
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,200
More than i care about his life.

354
00:15:58,235 --> 00:15:59,265
Okay,you're jerking me around.

355
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,900
There's no reason to be
a doctor if you don't care-

356
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:01,765
I care about life.

357
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,050
I just don't care about his.

358
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,300
He doesn't care. Why should i?

359
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:05,567
My time is better spent-

360
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:06,800
Kissing up to your boss.

361
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,500
Average doctor cuts off a patient

362
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,865
18 seconds into a history

363
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,500
Because that's all the time he's got.

364
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,800
Meanwhile six of us are 
ministering to a guy

365
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:15,465
With a death wish.

366
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,600
So why do you want the job?

367
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,600
Not because i'm maximizing
my service to mankind.

368
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,400
Good for you.

369
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,900
Where is he?

370
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,765
We're gonna spend the next hour

371
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Looking for a guy who
doesn't want to be found.

372
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,100
Jimmy quidd's greatest stiff.

373
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,000
1989.

374
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,900
A profit-seeking entity released this?

375
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,900
Put it out himself.

376
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,200
He wanted people to listen,

377
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,500
But apparently didn't want people

378
00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:52,800
<i>To enjoy listening.</i>

379
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,465
- Now,why would someone-
- Truly a mystery.

380
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Why would anyone do something
just to aggravate people?

381
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,300
Why would you have a
blank liability release form,

382
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,200
Plus your checkbook, 
on top of your desk?

383
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Probably because they
were in the second drawer

384
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:14,217
<i>In a manila envelope 
under a book,</i>

385
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:16,165
And you put them on top of my desk.

386
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,800
You usually keep your 
checkbook at home.

387
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
It's your go-to excuse for
why you can't lend me money.

388
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,700
You're gonna pay the guy
the six grand,aren't you?

389
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,900
There are other people i write checks to.

390
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:29,165
I do have cable.

391
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,800
There's no negligence without injury.

392
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,065
I handed the guy a death sentence.

393
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,000
<i>He's not distressed with 
a death sentence.</i>

394
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:37,900
<i>He's distressed with 
a life sentence.</i>

395
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,200
I gave him three months of misery.

396
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,200
You gave him three months
of being someone special.

397
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,800
You're paying the guy
because he used to be boring,

398
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:47,600
And without you he's 
gonna be boring again.

399
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,800
Hi.

400
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,000
Results of the malaria test already?

401
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,300
Well,no.

402
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,300
But we were wondering
if you'd sent the patient

403
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:59,300
For any additional... tests.

404
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,800
You lost the patient.

405
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,600
Taub,you check lost and found.

406
00:18:08,635 --> 00:18:11,300
Thirteen... come with me.

407
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,400
Why do you love drug addicts?

408
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,000
I won't pigeonhole the patients,

409
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:19,100
So that means i'm-

410
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,100
Perfectly capable of
drawing my own conclusions.

411
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,865
Are you capable of 
answering a question?

412
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,500
- I think there's more to him than the drugs.
- Admirable. Why?

413
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:28,400
I need a reason for doing
something admirable?

414
00:18:28,435 --> 00:18:29,465
<i>There's always a reason.</i>

415
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,600
He's a patient, you don't know him.

416
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:31,567
Why do you like him?

417
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:32,601
<i>The alcoholic parent,</i>

418
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:33,600
<i>Druggie youth.</i>

419
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,700
There's no such thing as
a saint without a past.

420
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:36,767
Or a sinner without a future.

421
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:37,765
<i>What makes you so sure</i>

422
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,100
That drugs are a mask 
for something else?

423
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,400
Drugs are always a mask 
for something else.

424
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,400
That's the dumbest
thing i've heard in my life.

425
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,700
<i>You really want this job?</i>

426
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,500
You think you can talk me into leaving?

427
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,965
You're a person who likes her privacy

428
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,900
Working for a man who
needs to know everything.

429
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,700
You're a person who 
cares about her patients

430
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
Working for a man that 
cares about games.

431
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:11,500
Shh-Shh.

432
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,200
I hear him.

433
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,000
<i>So neither sleet nor hail</i>

434
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,800
Nor dread of night.

435
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,765
Ha!

436
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,900
Wait,wait,wait...

437
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,765
Malaria's not contagious.

438
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,400
Children,i bid you... good night!

439
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,500
And i'm off! Aah-

440
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
<i>Hey...</i>

441
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,300
Which one of you guys 
sapped my powers?

442
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Was it you?

443
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,000
Did you take my powers?

444
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,500
Maybe it was you.

445
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:47,665
Well,no matter.

446
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,500
See,i'm feeling stronger already.

447
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,100
It's okay.

448
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,400
It's okay. He's okay.

449
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,500
Respiration's good, pulse is solid.

450
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,400
We need a lot of nurses in here.

451
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,000
Dr. Cuddy.

452
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,700
That face that launched
a thousand long faces.

453
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,000
Get control of your patient.

454
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,500
Strap him to the bed if you have to.

455
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:29,000
I want to keep all four.

456
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,500
You can have two.

457
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,900
You don't get negotiation, do you?

458
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,165
<i>I say four,</i>

459
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,000
You say three,we finally
settle on three and a half.

460
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,400
Which would be good news for taub.

461
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:39,800
<i>You don't want four.</i>

462
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,300
You don't want three.

463
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:42,700
But if i say three,

464
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,200
You get to keep playing your game.

465
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,900
Who would you pick?

466
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,200
Are you asking my opinion?

467
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,900
If you have any absolute truths,

468
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:53,000
That would be even better.

469
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,665
You never want my advice.

470
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,900
You spend your life
trying to avoid my advice.

471
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,265
You're a bureaucratic nightmare,

472
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,665
<i>You're a chronic pain in the ass,</i>

473
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,900
And you're a second-rate doctor at best.

474
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,900
Am i blushing?

475
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,700
But you do...

476
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,300
Know this stuff.

477
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,400
Can we get this over with?

478
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,400
Taub and kutner.

479
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,565
<i>Taub will stand up to you.</i>

480
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,000
You won't like him, 
but you'll respect him.

481
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,900
Kutner shares your 
philosophy of medicine.

482
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,250
God knows i don't need two of you,

483
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:31,200
But he will actually help you.

484
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,300
It's not malaria. 
Bloodwork's negative.

485
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,300
But we did find the 
reason for the D.I.C.

486
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:37,265
Bad blood fragments.

487
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,000
If we can figure out 
how they got there-

488
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,465
Blood exposure during sex?

489
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,000
Hemolysis from the malaria meds?

490
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:48,165
Stop guessing.

491
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,965
You'll spoil the surprise.

492
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,900
If you're looking to get information

493
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:51,365
Out of the guy,

494
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,600
He's not exactly the 
"bare-your-soul" type.

495
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,800
Hey,i was wondering 
if you guys know

496
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,500
Girl from Ipanema.

497
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,865
What are you doing?

498
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,500
Nothing. What are you doing?

499
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,700
That's mine,man.

500
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,900
Oh,you're gonna be 
denying that in a second.

501
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,100
Next time make sure 
you bring enough

502
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:20,400
For the whole class.

503
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,000
He's been sharing 
needles with this guy.

504
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,665
As he injected this guy's blood,

505
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,500
His own blood attacked it, 
chewed it up.

506
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:28,100
Those were the fragments we found.

507
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,800
So D.I.C. was nothing?

508
00:22:29,835 --> 00:22:31,100
We're back to bloody vomit

509
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,900
And his two dozen other
drug or non-Drug symptoms.

510
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
Re-Check everything.

511
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,600
Throw these guys out,

512
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,900
And strap the patient down.

513
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,300
House!

514
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,600
<i>Respiratory failure.</i>

515
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,100
Good news for you,thirteen.

516
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,490
'Cause that is definitely not drugs.

517
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,310
The blood clots were drug-Related.

518
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,100
The coughing up blood
and the respiratory arrests

519
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,570
Are still on the table.

520
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,480
Inhalants-

521
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,480
If i'd wanted a knee-Jerk drug diagnosis,

522
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,170
I would have told foreman where we are.

523
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,400
He knows where we are.

524
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,100
Because he followed you!

525
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,890
I followed taub. 
I followed her.

526
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,990
<i>He had a bleeding problem.</i>

527
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,420
That could cause respiratory arrest.

528
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,690
If i wanted to forgive his
drano-Drinking ways,

529
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,050
I wouldn't ignore what you just said.

530
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,120
<i>Could be an infection.</i>

531
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,040
No,the lumbar puncture's clear.

532
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,310
Uh,what lumbar puncture?

533
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,730
You didn't authorize that test.

534
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,950
True,and yet,here 
i am with the results.

535
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,820
Thirteen thought it
was bacterial meningitis.

536
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,590
And i had the eyeball.

537
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,840
It was a harmless test.

538
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,050
The patient's welfare still counts

539
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,010
For something,doesn't it?

540
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,290
Yep. Minus 50.

541
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,230
<i>(Kutner) Chronic pulmonary
embolism would explain</i>

542
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,610
<i>The breathing problem</i>

543
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,040
And the blood coming from his lungs.

544
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,350
I'll run an- You're not running any tests.

545
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,540
He knows it's not P.E.S.

546
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,440
The guy's d-Dimer's normal.

547
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,320
That doesn't always rule out-

548
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,450
Go in to run one test,

549
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,110
Run eight more like she did,
find out which one's right.

550
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,530
Then comes back 
with a brilliant guess.

551
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,230
Is this true? No.

552
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,600
Too bad,'cause that would
have earned you 40 points

553
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,570
For cleverness.

554
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,690
<i>The points go to amber.</i>

555
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,820
<i>Foreman,you run the tests. 
Sure.</i>

556
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,510
Anything i can do to 
help your game.

557
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,200
He's not gonna run the tests,
is he? I don't think so.

558
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,070
No.

559
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,670
So what's wrong with me?

560
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,460
You mean besides your music?

561
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,920
Oh,well,sure,

562
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,560
'Cause i don't play 
your kind of music,

563
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,760
It's not music,right? Yeah.

564
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,480
I resent you because 
you're not perry como.

565
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,980
Look,i don't-

566
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,410
I don't play for an audience,okay?

567
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,970
Well,then,that stage you stand on

568
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,240
Is an odd choice.

569
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,840
I just- I do it for me,okay?

570
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,360
I don't do it for you.

571
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,090
You have three choices in this life.

572
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,380
Be good,get good,or give up.

573
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,100
You've gone for column "d. " Why?

574
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,280
Simple answer is

575
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,860
If you don't try,you can't fail.

576
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,610
Are you really that simple?

577
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,450
Look,you know,some people...

578
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,230
They like my music.

579
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,470
Most people can't stand it.

580
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,210
But they just sort of just
shrug and ignore me.

581
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,880
But a few,the feel like 
they have to tell me

582
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,390
What i'm screwing up.

583
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,460
You know,what i'm wasting.

584
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,780
Why do they care?

585
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,510
You have some peculiar
masses near your heart.

586
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,010
Peculiar how?

587
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,130
Well,unlike your music,

588
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,450
They elicit some 
emotional response.

589
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,575
That's odd.
What?

590
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,060
You care if i appreciate your music,

591
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,310
But you don't care if you live or die.

592
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,110
<i>Maybe the answer is that simple.</i>

593
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,970
I can't apologize enough.

594
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,360
To you,to your family.

595
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,970
There may not be any
technical liability here,but-

596
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,350
You're ripping it up because
you think it would be wrong

597
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,800
To take money from me?

598
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,690
I think it would be wr

599
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,090
So little money from you.

600
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,960
You're out 6,000-

601
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,560
You ruined my life.

602
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,390
I ruined three months.

603
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,250
For the first time in my life,

604
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,500
I was living in the present.

605
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,550
'Cause that's all there was.

606
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,880
You're suing me not for 
the wrong diagnosis,

607
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,120
But for the right one?

608
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,140
Have you spoken to a lawyer?

609
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,330
You gave me happiness...

610
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,450
And then you took it away.

611
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,080
Definitely no emboli.

612
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,180
It's pretty fuzzy.

613
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,770
Hey,for point and
shoot i thought i did okay.

614
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,080
It's fuzzy because
he was still shaking

615
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,660
'Cause he was coming 
down from the heroin.

616
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,790
Where is everybody else?

617
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,790
The clinic's been quarantined.

618
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,460
A patient came in with
avian flu-Like symptoms.

619
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,710
And 50 extra dollars in 
spending money.

620
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,580
Can you do this echo again?

621
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,510
Okay,minus five for ingratitude!

622
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,860
No "Thank you,Dr. House. "

623
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,500
No "here's a bottle of codeine

624
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,230
For your troubles,Dr. House. 
" Oh,no.

625
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,730
I was asking if you could do it again

626
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,960
After giving him a sedative

627
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,260
To keep him still.

628
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,440
I could.

629
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,810
We'd definitely get the answer.

630
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,190
But since the opiates 
would decrease

631
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,270
His respiratory drive,

632
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,050
<i>And he already can 
barely breathe,</i>

633
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,610
Minus ten for asking 
me to kill the patient.

634
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,880
<i>What if it's a congenital defect?</i>

635
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,860
An anomalous vessel on his heart?

636
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,390
You know that the heart
does the blood stuff,right?

637
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,270
And the lungs do the breathing.

638
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,800
If the vessel wrapped 
around his trachea?

639
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,980
What do you want me to do?

640
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,270
Mra.

641
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,300
See if you can get a
clear picture of that vessel.

642
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,790
<i>What-Wait-</i>

643
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,210
What-What-Why?

644
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,330
You said the picture sucked

645
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,790
Because the patient was shaking.

646
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,110
Mra will be worse.

647
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,200
We have to get a picture.

648
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,870
You were doing better
before you had a good idea.

649
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,240
How can we see it if
we don't take a picture?

650
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,320
You can see me,right?

651
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,450
We want to look at his heart.

652
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,170
With our eyes.

653
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,720
So i kill the patient on my operating table.

654
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,540
<i>You get to keep testing your team</i>

655
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,840
And i take the heat from cuddy.

656
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,730
If it goes that way,
yeah,that'll be excellent.

657
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,530
<i>His respiratory
status is through the floor.</i>

658
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,800
<i>If there's a vessel and
we don't remove it fast,</i>

659
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,110
Best case,he's on a ventilator for life.

660
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,740
Granted,it'll be a short one.

661
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,120
Who do you think i should hire?

662
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,280
You want me to tell you 
in front of him?

663
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,250
It would be rude to ask 
him to leave now.

664
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,730
If you don't do the surgery,

665
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,260
The patient will die.

666
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,800
You'll have had nothing to do with it.

667
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,770
And everyone will know that
you had nothing to do with it.

668
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,740
<i>And everyone will 
know that it's because</i>

669
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,690
You were pissed off at House for firing you.

670
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,500
You know that's not 
why i'm saying no.

671
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,110
But that's how it's gonna play out.

672
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,820
Keep him and amber.

673
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,060
You'll get stuff done.

674
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,580
Prep him for surgery.

675
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,590
This isn't an anomalous vessel.

676
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,450
Look at these lymph nodes.

677
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,050
<i>Way too big.</i>

678
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,100
There are the masses you saw.

679
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,080
70 over 40. He's crashing.

680
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,520
Two units of p. R.B.C.S.

681
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,890
Starting dopamine.
We're losing him!

682
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,550
So... how's your game going?

683
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,970
It's not whether
you win or lose.

684
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,040
Respiratory failure.

685
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,190
Enlarged lymph nodes.

686
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,040
Whatever this is,he's not
going to be breathing much longer.

687
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,840
Does foreman being
here mean the game's over?

688
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,810
It means the patient's 
life is almost over.

689
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,160
You can call it what you want.

690
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,340
We're done,people!

691
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,640
Come on!
I need ideas.

692
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,140
And i don't care who 
they come from.

693
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,160
Of course you do.

694
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,940
This is still a game.

695
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,820
You're still going to reward
whoever gets the right idea,

696
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,880
Punish whoever's wrong.

697
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,220
Hire who you want,get this over with.

698
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,050
Thirteen,kutner.

699
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,630
I'm sorry. Go home.

700
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,700
Why?

701
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,110
It doesn't matter.

702
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:26,970
He just told me that i've gotta-

703
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,750
Lungs are stiff,could be a. R.D.S.

704
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,390
You fluid-Overloaded him.

705
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,350
Anyone's lungs would
leak after that surgery.

706
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,065
Good-Bye.

707
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,950
Anaphylactic shock.

708
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,140
No sign of bronchospasm.

709
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,070
What if the lymph nodes are
caused by chronic stimulation

710
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,020
Of his immune system?

711
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,490
Impurities in his drugs 
could have caused-

712
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,070
Street drugs are laced
with all kinds of things.

713
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,730
An immune overreaction
would explain everything.

714
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,650
Drug diagnosis.

715
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,900
That's what you're going with.

716
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,660
That firing thing.

717
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,710
It was all a dream.

718
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,770
Go find where he gets
his drugs and what's in them.

719
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,220
Put him on dimercaprol
for heavy metal poisoning.

720
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,030
Competition works.

721
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,100
So you're not gonna
tell me who sells you drugs?

722
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,680
Why does it matter?

723
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,410
You're dying. Does that matter?

724
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,270
Not really.

725
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,300
I'm not an adult.

726
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,890
I never wanted to be.

727
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,790
So if the choice...

728
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,620
Is running out the clock with a walker...

729
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,950
And a bedpan...

730
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,660
You don't regret anything?

731
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,440
Well,there was a lot of drugs.

732
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,800
A lot of drinking...

733
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,920
A lot of fights.

734
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,120
I regret everything else.

735
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,190
You hate me,don't you?

736
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,190
Yeah.

737
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,610
I don't care.

738
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,740
What's it like?

739
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,030
It means you have no regrets.

740
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,030
Kinda sticks in your head,doesn't it?

741
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,310
This guy's amazing.

742
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,460
There's not one redeeming note.

743
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,500
What sort of a lawyer tells his client

744
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,130
He's got a case because 
he's going to live?

745
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,280
I've heard that not all lawyers

746
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,520
Are as ethical as the 
ones we see on tv.

747
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,740
I don't think this guy
even has a law degree.

748
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,640
A lot of the guys on tv don't,either.

749
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,630
I think he has a medical degree.

750
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,340
It directly affects my bottom line.

751
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,690
You have less money to lend-

752
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,820
I'm trying to take responsibility!

753
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,130
And i'm trying to teach you
that everyone is out for theirs.

754
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,530
You might as well keep yours.

755
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,670
And lend it to you?

756
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,870
You have to control everything.

757
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,460
How come you're going 
around asking everyone

758
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,620
Who you should fire?

759
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,450
I'm asking for input!

760
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,480
I thought you would have
admired the humility.

761
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,960
You like games because 
you can control them.

762
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,210
Oh,god-I'm gonna put 
the record back on.

763
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,390
You like what's interesting-

764
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,950
Never mind if it's real or good.

765
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,280
Wanna know why you
offered that guy six grand?

766
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,940
Life just happens,and that
scares the hell out of you!

767
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,340
You think you can cure pain.

768
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,830
You think you can avoid pain!

769
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,650
You think you're
responsible for every failure,

770
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,850
Every patient's boring life,

771
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,120
Ever friend's screwed-Up-

772
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,840
You don't want to face it
any more than my patient does.

773
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,420
Dying's easy.

774
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,860
Living's hard.

775
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,350
That can't possibly be as
poignant as it sounded.

776
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,260
Uh,still can't find the drug source,

777
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,730
But i don't think that's the problem.

778
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,150
The dimercaprol isn't working.

779
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,430
And quidd volunteers at a
home for abandoned kids.

780
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,840
Why are you telling me this?

781
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,190
Because his bass player told me.

782
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,590
Is it medically relevant?

783
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,480
I don't know.

784
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,290
Well,then why are you-

785
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,860
Stop playing games and do your job!

786
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,110
No.

787
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:16,950
This time,i'm firing taub and amber.

788
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,520
This is a joke,right?

789
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,980
It's only a joke if you
come up with the answer.

790
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,660
It's not really funny if you don't.

791
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,000
Thirteen and kutner,you're fired too.

792
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,290
Foreman.
He's a druggie.

793
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,740
I was never sure there was
a disease in the first place.

794
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,280
So all we know is that he's dying.

795
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,250
Who wants to tell the patient?

796
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,640
Fine.

797
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,470
We'll get some kid to go talk to him.

798
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,520
It's the only people
he gets along with anyway.

799
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,410
Are we still fired?

800
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,820
He works with abandoned kids?

801
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,890
Is it medically relevant?

802
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,920
I think so.

803
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,510
I need a brain biopsy.

804
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,410
For the patient.

805
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,010
Stop it.

806
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,880
You two switch?

807
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,170
You want to drill into a skull

808
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:16,070
Of a patient who almost died
on the operating table yesterday?

809
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,460
Why are they here?

810
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,240
Because i wouldn't have gotten
the answer without each of them.

811
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,280
You could have just told me.

812
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,880
I want you to feel guilty.

813
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,780
She thinks the patient's a loser.

814
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,590
She thinks the patient's a winner;

815
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,310
Just a regular guy with a 
regular problem.

816
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,000
He thinks he's gonna be
great once he's all growed up.

817
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,310
And he thinks...

818
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,460
What did you think?

819
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,040
Autoimmune. Right.

820
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,870
Less interesting,
but just as important.

821
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We can't all be right.

822
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,620
You're all wrong.

823
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,370
My mom always said that
two wrongs don't make a right.

824
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,070
She never said anything 
about four wrongs.

825
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,050
I always found that suspicious.

826
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,530
Plain old measles.

827
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,970
Constant exposure from hanging out

828
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,450
With oliver twist and his lot.

829
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,460
I assume he's been vaccinated.

830
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,210
Patient's immune system was shredded

831
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,740
With years of drugs.

832
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,920
They're early markers 
of rash and fever.

833
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,320
Would have been lost in a druggie.

834
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,860
His immune system overreacted.

835
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,090
That's why his body went haywire.

836
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,240
That's clever.

837
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,730
You're not doing a biopsy
without neurological symptoms.

838
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,620
If i'm right,the virus is in his brain.

839
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,830
Wrong course of treatment
could be his last course of-

840
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,180
I need a neurological-

841
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,550
He kept swallowing.

842
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,400
<i>Could be neurological.</i>

843
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,060
Could be a complex partial seizure.

844
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,090
What did it look like?

845
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,360
Good... god,woman.

846
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,840
How much more proof do you need?

847
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,650
If you can induce a seizure,
you can have your biopsy.

848
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,950
Hup!

849
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,730
We're gonna use flashing lights.

850
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,830
Noxious stimulation,
it'll irritate your brain.

851
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,060
If there's damage to your neurons,

852
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,740
It'll trigger a seizure that we can-

853
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,480
I got something much more noxious.

854
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,180
It's not as commonly used,

855
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,620
But sound can be just as big an irritant.

856
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,810
Now remind me of your influences here.

857
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,350
'Cause i'm gonna say,

858
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,260
Thelonious monk and the
sound a trash compactor makes

859
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,520
When you crawl inside it.

860
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,810
Mmph.

861
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,010
I don't do it for you. I do it for me.

862
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,340
What do you think?

863
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,900
Is he seizing or dancing?

864
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,050
Seizing.

865
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,390
Play him the b-Side. It's even worse.

866
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,670
Schedule an O.R. for the biopsy.

867
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,880
See you in the lecture hall.

868
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,220
A little mood music.

869
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,150
Build the suspense.

870
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,400
Sounds more folky.

871
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,420
You seriously have no idea
when to shut up. Do you?

872
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,720
Amber,please stand.

873
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,150
You didn't call me bitch. Is that bad?

874
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,920
You play the game better
than anybody else here.

875
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,380
But for the wrong reasons.

876
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,420
Reasons don't matter.
Results are the only thing-

877
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,660
You were wrong.

878
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,910
20 years ago,
This was recorded by jim moskowitz.

879
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,670
Who later became 
known as jimmy quidd.

880
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,100
Loves kids,

881
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,120
Apparently has a heart,
perhaps even a soul.

882
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,870
If you're gonna work for me,

883
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,080
You have to be willing to be wrong,

884
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,130
Willing to lose.

885
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,260
'Cause you just did.

886
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,930
You're fired.

887
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,840
Thirteen,please stand.

888
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,100
You're fired.

889
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,430
You just said i was right about-

890
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,920
He was a drug addict.

891
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,830
Four applicants,two spots.

892
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,050
If i had three,i'd keep you.

893
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,250
Game over.

894
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,260
Mmph.

895
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,570
You're gonna have to grow old after all.

896
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,580
You've got measles.

897
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,800
We're blasting you with corticosteroids.

898
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,950
What's wrong with you?

899
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,260
I got fired.

900
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,130
What are you doing here?

901
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,860
Trying not to care.

902
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,410
Yeah.

903
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,730
Well,that's not easy.

904
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,310
What the hell did you do?

905
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,120
You told me to hire kutner and taub.

906
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,550
Because i knew you wouldn't.

907
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,530
Oops.

908
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,460
I can't let you hire two men.

909
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,610
Now,that is sexist.

910
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,190
You've already got foreman.

911
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,500
Is he a dude?

912
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,160
Hire a woman too.

913
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,390
Hire two women.

914
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:22,040
You can have the one
that gives a crap about people.

915
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,840
They both do.

916
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,380
Great.

917
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,490
Hire thirteen.

918
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,330
This was your plan all along.

919
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,170
Well,at least the games are over.

920
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,790
How long have you known me?
