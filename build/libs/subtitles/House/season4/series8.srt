1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,565
Chinese water torture cell

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,400
Was invented in 1911
by Harry Houdini.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,300
Nothing like new material.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,965
He was lowered head first
into the water.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
His ankle was locked and
bolted to the top of the tank.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,400
I'm going to need a volunteer.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,200
The guy dislocating
his shoulder...

8
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,065
Yeah...

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,000
Could you tell the guy
next to you to come up?

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,665
Come on,
get up there, man.

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,100
Get up there, get up there!
Come on!

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,500
Come on!

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,165
- Hi. Have we met before?
- No.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
See, if you said yes, you could
have gone back to your seat.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,250
Now, can you vouch
for this audience

16
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:51,900
That this is
a glass tank full of water?

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,465
- Yeah.
- No, you can't.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,300
You haven't done anything yet.
Come on.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,500
Knock on the glass.
Solid glass.

20
00:00:58,535 --> 00:00:59,300
Knock on it.

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,400
It's real water too.

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,800
Ilana, splash the guy.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,700
Does that feel wet
to you?

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,600
- Yeah.
- And you think that proves it's water?

25
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:08,465
I think we have met.

26
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,465
Do you know
the public washroom

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,000
Behind the truck stop
east of omaha?

28
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:11,465
No.

29
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
See, if you'd said yes,
that would have been so funny.

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,200
Hold out your arms
for me.

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,700
You've done this
before, right?

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,565
No.

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,900
Again, two choices, and
you went for the unfunny one.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,400
Now, remember,
there's only one thing

35
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,665
You've got to be able to do-

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,500
Drag a screaming,
crying, shackled man

37
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:45,900
Out of a tank of water.

38
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,100
Up!

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,100
Hey, you can swim, right?

40
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,600
Whoa, whoa,
tell me you can swim.

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,400
Yeah.

42
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,500
Two answers, man.

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Two answers!

44
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,400
Is that part of the act?

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,200
I'm new.
I think so.

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,500
Maybe not.

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,300
Get up here!

48
00:02:38,200 --> 00:03:00,000
House MD 
Season 4 Episode 8
"You don't want to know"

49
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,900
Five eager doctors,

50
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:24,500
And no sick people.

51
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,600
Let us try and fill
our spare time

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,300
With a new challenge.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,365
The winner gets immunity.

54
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,500
I have a sick guy.
I saw this magician last night-

55
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:34,600
The girl's fine.

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
He didn't really cut her
in half.

57
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:36,565
His heart stopped

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
While he was hanging
upside down in the water tank.

59
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,200
A drowning man's
heart stopped.

60
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:41,400
That is a mystery.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,200
<i>Along with immunity,</i>

62
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,900
The winner
gets to nominate two-

63
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:45,865
<i>He lost consciousness</i>

64
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,550
Almost as soon
as he hit the water.

65
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:49,200
You have to leave work
at 6:00 p. M.,

66
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,700
But you make time
for man dates?

67
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:51,665
What's the challenge?

68
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,100
Are we not allowed
to be friends?

69
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:54,265
No, i'm just hurt.

70
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,950
When i asked you
to come see Mama Mia-

71
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,600
No history of heart disease.
No angina.

72
00:03:57,635 --> 00:03:58,765
- No-
- He's lying.

73
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,900
- About his history? ER confirmed.
- About everything. He's a magician.

74
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:02,665
That's what they do.

75
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,600
He screwed up the trick,
he started drowning,

76
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:05,665
He got a cardiac arrest.

77
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,300
You were talking
about a challenge?

78
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,400
The winner nominates...

79
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,700
Two of your competitors.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
<i>I will fire one of them.</i>

81
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,465
Even if he was drowning,

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,400
It would have taken longer
to set off a cardiac incident

83
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,400
Without some underlying
problem that-

84
00:04:22,435 --> 00:04:24,500
Fine. Go run your tests.

85
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,300
If you're wrong,
you're fired.

86
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:27,465
If i'm right, do i stay?

87
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,800
If i say no, are you
gonna let your patient die?

88
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,265
What's the challenge?

89
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,765
We can all applaud the doctor

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,450
Who's willing
to break all the rules.

91
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:42,100
But the real hero
is the unsung doctor,

92
00:04:42,135 --> 00:04:43,700
Toiling in anonymity,

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,700
'Cause he broke the rules
without getting caught.

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,900
I need to know
you have these skills.

95
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,700
I need you...

96
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,300
To bring me the thong
of lisa cuddy.

97
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,100
Not kidding.

98
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,100
Thong. Cuddy. Go.

99
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
It's how i got hired.

100
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,100
You're actually
considering this?

101
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,550
If you want to stand
on principle,

102
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,965
I really
respect you for that.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,600
It's childish, unprofessional,
and inappropriate.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,250
The job is not worth it.

105
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:26,465
We should all beg off.

106
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,400
Tell him we failed.
No winners, no losers.

107
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,100
Fine.

108
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
You're gonna do it,
aren't you?

109
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:35,000
Of course
i'm gonna do it.

110
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,365
No valvular regurgitation,

111
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,300
No wall motion abnorbnbnormalities,
no structural defects.

112
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
If you didn't sound
so despondent,

113
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:46,567
I'd say
that was good news.

114
00:05:46,602 --> 00:05:48,300
It is for you,
not for him.

115
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,100
Notice any heaviness in your legs
the last couple days?

116
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:52,500
Why isn't it
good news for you?

117
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,000
Because, if there's nothing
wrong with you, he gets fired.

118
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,165
Seriously?

119
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,900
Somewhat seriously.
Your legs?

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,565
Haven't noticed anything
out of the ordinary.

121
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,700
- Shortness of breath?
- Would it help if i puked?

122
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Pick a card.

123
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,765
Any tightness
in your chest or arms?

124
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,300
- Pick a card.
- You don't seem too worried.

125
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:14,765
Would you please
pick a card?

126
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,365
Our boss thinks
your cardiac arrest

127
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,900
Was just a result of you
accidentally drowning.

128
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:20,700
Your boss is an idiot.
Put it back.

129
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,100
Shuffle 'em up.

130
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,600
So then why
aren't you worried?

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,700
Either i'm dying
or i'm not.

132
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,100
I mean, i don't want
the ride to be over,

133
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:29,465
But unless worrying

134
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,400
Is some new form
of treatment...

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Your card.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,800
No.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,200
I'm gonna prep you
for a transesophageal echo.

138
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,365
You sure you shuffled these?

139
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,200
And i'm gonna need
to sedate you.

140
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,100
Might wanna check
your wallet first.

141
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,800
Would you check your wallet?
It's part of the trick.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,800
Oh.

143
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,700
That's my card.
How did you do that?

144
00:06:57,735 --> 00:06:58,600
Do it again.

145
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,500
Thought you weren't playing.

146
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:13,265
I'm not.

147
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,800
She'll fire you
if she catches you.

148
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:15,665
I don't think
she can fire me

149
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,600
<i>For not trying
to steal her panties.</i>

150
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:19,100
You trying
to will them off?

151
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:20,300
If i had a plan,

152
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
<i>The first part would be not
telling you what the plan was.</i>

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,200
You haven't touched
that coffee.

154
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,965
Yes, i have.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
She can't keep her panties on
if they're wet.

156
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,000
<i>We work together.</i>

157
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
One wins,
protects the other.

158
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:35,265
Or i win by myself,

159
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,900
And then you try desperately
to convince me to spare you.

160
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,900
Dr. Cuddy.

161
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:45,000
- Ooh!
- Oh!

162
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,265
Dr. Taub, are you okay?

163
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,600
I- I just tripped.
I'm so sorry.

164
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,865
I have some extra time.

165
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
Do you need any help
in the clinic?

166
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:53,900
Uh... okay.

167
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,100
We found no apparent
cause for the arrest.

168
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:03,565
T.T.E. And T.E.E.
Revealed no-

169
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,900
Send the patient home.
You can give him a lift.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,965
We checked for clots.
We checked for-

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're reporting to me because
you're scared to report to house

172
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:13,400
Because you found nothing,
because this isn't a case.

173
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,000
And you thought
i'd save your ass.

174
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:15,600
Yeah.

175
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,765
I thought he was sick.

176
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
What was i
supposed to do?

177
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,365
What about his lungs?

178
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,600
Decreased oxygen saturation
leads to heart failure.

179
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:26,700
E.R. Didn't find
anything.

180
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:27,565
E.R. Wasn't looking.

181
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,300
Too busy trying
to keep him alive.

182
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,700
Get an mri.

183
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,565
Clinic.

184
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,865
Yes, can you ask dr. Cuddy

185
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,000
To come to the nurse's station,
stat?

186
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:41,800
Right away.

187
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,665
I asked you to get
doctor-

188
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,500
Dr. Taub said
she'd be right out.

189
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,100
A fungus in my lungs?

190
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,300
How would i even get
something like that?

191
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:22,367
Right now,
it's just a theory.

192
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:23,365
We don't even know
if it's-

193
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,600
I knew i shouldn't have done
those mushrooms in college.

194
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm sure
there's no connection.

195
00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:27,900
It was a joke.

196
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,450
You really lose
your sense of humor

197
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,665
When your job's
on the line, huh?

198
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,900
Sorry. Most dying people
don't really like to-

199
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,900
Not that you're dying.

200
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,200
But a little sick
would be perfect, right?

201
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:38,800
Yeah.

202
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,800
Aah! My stomach!

203
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
Stabbing or throbbing?

204
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,900
Grey turner's sign.
He's got internal bleeding

205
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll call surgery.

206
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,365
Surgeons have transfused
three units ab positive,

207
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,100
But they're still looking
for the source of the bleed.

208
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:57,800
No trauma.
Could be liver disease.

209
00:09:57,835 --> 00:09:58,965
Vitamin k deficiency.

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,800
The only thing we know
for sure it's not... nothing.

211
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,000
<i>And we would have noticed
something chronic</i>

212
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:03,765
Like liver disease.

213
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
It's probably
an intestinal infarct-

214
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,600
I got it!

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,900
<i>Ahem.</i>

216
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,800
Eau de cuddy.

217
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,900
<i>No way.</i>

218
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,800
How did you get them?

219
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:19,000
Only one way.

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,650
These are not cuddy's panties.

221
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:25,300
- You don't think that i-
- No.

222
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,900
Also, she's wearing
a red bra today.

223
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Like i'm the only one
who noticed.

224
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Means the downstairs
will match.

225
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,200
Do your research,
people.

226
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,965
An intestinal infarct

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Could be linked
to the cardiac arrest.

228
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,165
Hike up your skirt.

229
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,600
Wow, that's rude,
even for you.

230
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:44,600
Hike it down then.

231
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,300
<i>You're wearing
a black bra.</i>

232
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,300
Let's see the underwear.

233
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:48,300
No!

234
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,400
You two cut a deal.

235
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,900
If you're not cheating,
you're not trying hard enough.

236
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,100
Is she not wearing
any underwear?

237
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,200
<i>Um, there's a guy
bleeding-</i>

238
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,000
Foreman, she's not wearing
any underwear.

239
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,665
You used to be more fun.

240
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,800
She's not wearing
any underwear-Big deal.

241
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:13,117
<i>When she stops
wearing clothes,</i>

242
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:14,400
Then we can drop
the medical stuff.

243
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:15,865
Let me see the mri film.

244
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,165
Oh, we didn't
get any images.

245
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
<i>He started screaming
as soon as i turned it on.</i>

246
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:20,300
Define "soon. "

247
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,700
Uh... i didn't even get
a chance to sit down.

248
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,400
You guys ever wonder

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,100
How he was gonna get out
of that water tank?

250
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,800
You-Come.

251
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Lacerations
in his digestive tract.

252
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
And his spleen
is shredded.

253
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,065
Ladies and gentlemen,

254
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,300
I have nothing
in my hands,

255
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:49,900
Nothing up my sleeve.

256
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,065
I do have something
in my pants,

257
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,500
But it's not gonna help
with this particular trick.

258
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,500
Watch closely.

259
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
How ya been?

260
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:01,900
Fine. Till now.

261
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Ta-Da!

262
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,500
Now you... disappear.

263
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,300
<i>Look familiar?</i>

264
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,800
The mri's magnet ripped this
through your intestine

265
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:25,000
Into your spleen.

266
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,800
Forgot about that.

267
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,500
On account
of almost dying.

268
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,300
Where's dr. Kutner?

269
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,100
He's no longer
on your case.

270
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,800
'Cause there's nothing
wrong with you.

271
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,700
I didn't screw up
that trick.

272
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,100
Everything that's happened
can be explained

273
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,400
By you being forgetful
and incompetent.

274
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,250
You screwed up,
you passed out-

275
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:46,900
Know my favorite time
to lie?

276
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,000
When my life hangs
in the balance.

277
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,900
Your life doesn't hang
in the balance.

278
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,100
You know your life
doesn't hang in the balance.

279
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:54,767
<i>Your reputation
might hang-</i>

280
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:56,400
You ever do magic
as a kid?

281
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,800
You seem like
the type-

282
00:12:57,835 --> 00:12:59,600
Lonely, obsessive.

283
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,700
I outgrew it. You?

284
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,600
Pick a card.

285
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Too much trouble.

286
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,300
Can i just pick my nose?

287
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:07,700
I'm not a hack.

288
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,200
If i tell you how it's done,
will you go home?

289
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,800
So you gonna make it magically
appear in my wallet?

290
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,600
You are a hack.

291
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,200
I don't screw up.

292
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,700
A nosebleed that major
means he's actually sick.

293
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Means the cardiac arrest
was a symptom.

294
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,900
Stop gloating.

295
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,065
I'm not gloating.

296
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,300
Then what's that smirk?

297
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,000
No smirk.
This is how i look.

298
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,700
What about
the underwear challenge?

299
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
I declare it
officially on hold.

300
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,100
Not really fair,
but i get it.

301
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
It's cuddy's.

302
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,400
Pull down your pants.

303
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:31,565
You think i'm lying?

304
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,450
No. I wanna give you
a reward.

305
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:35,300
<i>Yes, i think
you're lying.</i>

306
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,665
Cardiac arrest
plus nose bleed-Go.

307
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,300
Uh, patient has no significant
family history,

308
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:41,867
No angina,
no prior attacks.

309
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:43,400
<i>What if it
isn't his heart?</i>

310
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,650
What if it's the vessels
around his heart?

311
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,692
Polyarteritis nodosa
causes cardiac symptoms

312
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:49,665
And hypertension,
which makes his nose bleed.

313
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,400
<i>You know what else makes your
nose bleed and your heart race?</i>

314
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:55,100
Cocaine. Guy works in a b-List
nightclub in atlantic city.

315
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:57,600
He's gotta be taking
regular rolls in the snow.

316
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,600
You, take the gloater
to the patient's drug den.

317
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:03,100
Make sure you pat down
his pockets before you leave.

318
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,565
You and big love,

319
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,500
Biopsy of blood vessel
from around the heart.

320
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:08,200
Test for
polyarteritis nodosa.

321
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,500
You...

322
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,000
In my office.

323
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,600
Those aren't my panties.

324
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
I know.

325
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,300
Hypothetical.

326
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,500
A young woman
does something clumsy in public.

327
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,650
<i>And instead of
laughing it off,</i>

328
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,200
She gets
irrationally upset.

329
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,900
Explain.

330
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,165
Maybe she's clumsy
'cause she's nervous,

331
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,700
'Cause she forgot to do
her spelling homework.

332
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
In my hypothetical,
she's eight.

333
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,500
But this girl's
not insecure.

334
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,800
Seems more like
she's afraid.

335
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,865
Do you have a point,

336
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,700
Or did you just get
a new book of riddles?

337
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:51,500
I think you're hiding
a medical condition.

338
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,400
I'm not.

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,700
I'm glad we had this talk.

340
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,650
Doctors often try to ignore
their symptoms

341
00:15:57,685 --> 00:16:00,400
'Cause they think
they can't get sick.

342
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,100
If you got something
going on,

343
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,665
I need you
to take care of it.

344
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,300
And i take your compassion
entirely at face value.

345
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:08,200
It's not compassion.
It's self-Interest.

346
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:08,965
I want my team healthy.

347
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,100
It's not self-Interest.
It's curiosity.

348
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,865
I dropped a file, house.

349
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,365
I start bleeding
from the eyes,

350
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,100
I'll be sure
to make an appointment.

351
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay.

352
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,000
Eh, found some pot.

353
00:16:25,035 --> 00:16:25,900
Bag it.

354
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
I'm not sure it really fits
the symptoms.

355
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:27,865
Of course not,

356
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,000
But it'd be irresponsible
to leave it here.

357
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,200
You have a quarter?

358
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:35,065
No.

359
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,800
How did cole get those panties
off cuddy?

360
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:38,117
They were never
on her.

361
00:16:38,152 --> 00:16:39,400
No way those are hers.

362
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
Uh-Huh.

363
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,265
Tularemia.

364
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,900
No, you'd have
to have rabbits.

365
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,865
True-Maybe a tick

366
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,465
Jumped from a rabbit
and landed

367
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,900
On one of these
white, fluffy alligators.

368
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,700
Then it jumps
onto our patient,

369
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,900
Transfers the bacteria,
causes pericarditis.

370
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,200
Explains everything.

371
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,800
What are you giving me?

372
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,800
How'd you do the trick?

373
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,400
Oh, if i explain,
it becomes mundane,

374
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,265
And you lose
the actual magic.

375
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,000
<i>What do you mean,
the actual magic?</i>

376
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,900
<i>Think you're actually
sawing women in half?</i>

377
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,500
You gonna tell me what's
wrong with me or not?

378
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:21,800
Magic is cool.

379
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,700
Actual magic
is oxymoronic.

380
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,965
Might not even be oxy.

381
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,700
You're not gonna tell me
unless i tell you?

382
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,150
You got a nurse
to plant the card.

383
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,742
I can't get a nurse
to help me pee.

384
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:36,300
You got a buddy
to plant the card.

385
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,900
The fun...
is in not knowing.

386
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,800
The fun...
is in knowing.

387
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,100
Oh, my head. Oh!

388
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
I got a headache.

389
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,000
How bad?
Is it new?

390
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,665
It's not too bad.

391
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,100
I'll-I'll just
take one of these...

392
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Vicodin.

393
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,500
You eat a lot of beets,
you have an electric toothbrush,

394
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:16,000
And you sleep
less than six hours a night.

395
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:17,100
That's impressive.

396
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,200
The red betamine
from the beets

397
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,065
Stains the plaque deposits
on your teeth,

398
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,600
Which are then swirled
by your spinning toothbrush.

399
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,967
Your heavy lids
and your prematurely aging skin

400
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:28,101
Tell me that you're carrying
a major sleep debt.

401
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:30,318
That was way cooler
before you explained it.

402
00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:32,500
It was meaningless
until i explained it.

403
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,065
People come to my show

404
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,600
Because they want
a sense of wonder.

405
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,000
They want
to experience something

406
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,465
That they can't explain.

407
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,000
If the wonder's gone
when the truth is known,

408
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,100
There never was
any wonder.

409
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,900
You have tularemia
from your rabbits.

410
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,265
I've put you
on antibiotics.

411
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,800
You'll be better
in a couple of days.

412
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,900
Sorry to spoil
the mystery.

413
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,200
Thank you.

414
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,500
Because
it's very important

415
00:19:03,535 --> 00:19:05,900
To actually do it well.

416
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I'll get it.

417
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,600
Oh... my... god!

418
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,600
You're not wearing
underwear!

419
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:21,565
Of course, i'm-

420
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,100
Skirt that tight,
you got no secrets.

421
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,800
Skirt that tight,
i can tell if you got an i. U.D.

422
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,700
You've seen dr. Cole?

423
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,800
No.

424
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,900
You're blushing.

425
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:30,867
I am not.

426
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:31,800
Look at me.

427
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,800
Oh... my...

428
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
God!

429
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,400
How'd you do it?

430
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,500
So i'm safe?

431
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,400
In this job, yeah.

432
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Crotch,
on the other hand...

433
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
How'd you do it?

434
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,000
Prayer, mostly.

435
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,600
Just tell me.

436
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,300
Does cuddy have
her groove back?

437
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,600
It'd be rude of me
to discuss.

438
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,600
You handed over
her panties.

439
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,465
I don't think Gallantry's

440
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,265
Really an option
at this point.

441
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,500
If i tell you,
then where's the magic?

442
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:12,499
(Kutner)
he passed out.

443
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,499
Ultrasound revealed bleeding
around his heart.

444
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,199
<i>We drained 100 ccs
before it stopped.</i>

445
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,499
The antibiotics
aren't working.

446
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,900
It's obviously not tularemia
or any other infection.

447
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:21,965
Excuse me-
We were talking.

448
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,199
<i>(Taub) bleeding around the
heart could meaned biopsy</i>

449
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,199
When cole was looking
for the-

450
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,799
Why would you accuse
the man who decides your fate

451
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,200
<i>Of screwing up?</i>

452
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,500
(Taub) those really were her panties?

453
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,899
Cole has traveled through
the forest of crustaceans

454
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,700
And brought us
a treasure.

455
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,599
And he has earned
his reward.

456
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,999
If i could just get
the immunity, i-

457
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
No, sophie, you can't.

458
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,800
<i>Use whatever criteria
you want.</i>

459
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,799
Could be
a clotting issue.

460
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,899
(Amber) if he developed
d. I.C. After the surgery,

461
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,899
Even a normal biopsy bleeds
out of control.

462
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,899
So cardiac arrest
and d. I.C.

463
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,199
What's the common denominator?
Could be cancer.

464
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,499
<i>We've been looking in his chest
since he got here-It's clean.</i>

465
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:02,799
<i>(Taub) so the main mass is
somewhere else-Throws up a clot,</i>

466
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,100
<i>Blocks an artery in his heart,
causes the arrest.</i>

467
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Good!

468
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,700
Go find out where
he's hiding his cancer.

469
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,000
(Cole) if you swallowed any more metal,

470
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Now would be
a good time to tell us.

471
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,300
My hands feel
kind of numb.

472
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:26,200
You lost a lot of blood.

473
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,400
I'm gonna die.

474
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,000
Everybody gets scared
in a hospital.

475
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,299
You're sick,
you feel awful-

476
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,200
No.

477
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,600
This time tomorrow.

478
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,900
I'll be dead.

479
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,100
So who's going
on the block?

480
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,200
He thinks he's dying.

481
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,900
He's probably right.

482
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,900
Tomorrow.

483
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,500
You decide to put me up,
i totally get it.

484
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Nothing personal.

485
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,199
I haven't decided anything.

486
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,400
But you don't like me.

487
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,900
I like you.

488
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,600
Some fluid in the lungs.

489
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,200
No masses.

490
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,300
I'm manipulative.
[Typing]

491
00:22:23,335 --> 00:22:24,699
I play the game.

492
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,900
I can be a bitch.

493
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,300
There's a dark spot.

494
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,965
Damage from where the key
ripped through.

495
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,200
You're probably expecting me
to bash the others,

496
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,200
Give examples
of how they screwed up.

497
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,900
You know i can.

498
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,500
I'm a good doctor.

499
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
As good as anybody
around here.

500
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:43,700
Probably better.

501
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,500
You know that's
the only thing that matters.

502
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,400
<i>(Cole)
what's that?</i>

503
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,900
It's not a tumor.
It's another bleed.

504
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,300
This one's in his kidney.

505
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,800
And his thigh.

506
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,200
He's bleeding
all over the place.

507
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,300
His Time-Table might be right-on

508
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,600
(Cole)
it was creepy.

509
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,400
The patient predicted
his own death.

510
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,065
<i>(House) would have been more impressive</i>

511
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,199
<i>If he'd predicted
that he wasn't gonna die.</i>

512
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,600
Of course,
that takes longer to prove.

513
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,599
(Cole)
could be a symptom.

514
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,065
Sense of impending doom.

515
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,500
Yeah, could be
adrenal gland disorders,

516
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:30,065
Blood issues,
anaphylaxis.

517
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,999
If you're gonna kiss his ass
to protect your ass,

518
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,999
At least wait
until he's had a good idea.

519
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,899
<i>It's a symptom
of him being a charlatan.</i>

520
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,000
He's a second-Rate magician
with a mysterious illness.

521
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:39,299
Why wouldn't he
predict his own death?

522
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,399
If he's wrong,
we all forget it.

523
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,699
If he's right,
he goes out a legend.

524
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,599
<i>(Kutner) he got scared
right after a transfusion.</i>

525
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,199
Tainted blood
has been known to cause

526
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,349
A sense of
impending doom.

527
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,499
Could also explain
the d. I.C.

528
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,900
I predict all your pagers
go off... right now.

529
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,565
Oh!
But if it had happened...

530
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,499
Anyone bother
looking at his panel?

531
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,099
His immunoglobulin levels
are low.

532
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,565
That doesn't tell us
anything specific about-

533
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,199
Are you acting stupid 'cause
you know you're safe? Clever.

534
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,599
<i>(Foreman)
low immunoglobulin</i>

535
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,799
Plus failing heart,
plus fluid in the lungs,

536
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,149
<i>Plus internal bleeding,
equals amyloidosis.</i>

537
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:12,499
He's bleeding way too much
for amyloidosis.

538
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,699
Say anything about his hands
or feet feeling weak?

539
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,199
<i>(Cole)
he said his hands felt numb,</i>

540
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
But that's explained
by the blood loss.

541
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,000
No! Do not give me
credit for that.

542
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:26,299
<i>Close doesn't count.</i>

543
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,399
That's how people get sucked
into this stupidity.

544
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,499
He's seizing.

545
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,400
Somebody stabilize him.

546
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,299
<i>Rest of you,
pull his medical records.</i>

547
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,165
Go back ten years.

548
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,965
Look for joint pain,
fatigue,

549
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,300
Anything associated
with amyloidosis.

550
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,700
Mr Flynn, node if you can hear me.

551
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,399
You had
a grand mal seizure.

552
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,399
We're giving you liquids
and an anticonvulsant.

553
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Just try to rest.

554
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,900
Pulse is dropping.
He's stabilizing.

555
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,699
You're not gonna put me
on the block, are you?

556
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,600
I haven't decided
who i'm gonna pick.

557
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
That's cool.

558
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,800
His legs look swollen
to you?

559
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,699
Slight swelling
could be renal.

560
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,200
I babysat for you.

561
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,999
I decided i'm gonna make
my decision

562
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Based solely on who
deserves to be here.

563
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:10,700
That's admirable,
though stupid.

564
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,300
<i>You shouldn't save
the strongest.</i>

565
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:13,199
You should get r the strong

566
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,800
Eliminate your competition,
which is definitely not me.

567
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,200
And i'm your friend.

568
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,999
And how are you
gonna explain to your kid

569
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,700
That i can't take him
to the zoo next week

570
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:23,300
<i>Because you got me fired?</i>

571
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Kutner.

572
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,500
He's gonna seize again.

573
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,899
Flank pain.
His kidneys are shutting down.

574
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,700
Also... amber's a racist.

575
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,100
(Wilson)
you knew they'd get paged?

576
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,699
I noticed a trend-

577
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,765
If nobody does anything,

578
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,700
Sick people
often get sicker.

579
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,999
You think it's
remotely possible they had sex?

580
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
They're both single.

581
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,699
It's still legal
in the blue states.

582
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,400
She barely knows him.

583
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,899
You know,
in some cultures,

584
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,200
Hiring people to steal
someone's underpants

585
00:25:52,235 --> 00:25:53,517
Is considered wooing.

586
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,765
You should move there.

587
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,099
Because here it's just,
you know, creepy.

588
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,400
There was no woo.

589
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,700
This was
an effective test.

590
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,700
This is beneath my skills.

591
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,900
(Kutner)
kidneys are shutting down.

592
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,299
Led to a sodium deficiency.
Caused him to seize.

593
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,599
Kidney failure
means i was right

594
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,799
About amyloidosis.

595
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,499
Except that nothing
in his medical history

596
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,065
Remotely indicates
amyloidosis.

597
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,800
So kidney failure proves
i'm right about the bad blood.

598
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:18,165
Bad blood doesn't explain
the heart or the liver.

599
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,499
His major symptoms didn't start
until after we transfused him.

600
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,499
Is cardiac arrest no longer
considered a major symptom?

601
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,999
Not when it's caused
by drowning.

602
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,799
So your new theory

603
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,499
Is that you're an idiot
to take this case.

604
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,099
Yes. Can i go test
that theory now?

605
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,065
<i>Waste of time.</i>

606
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,900
He needs a bone marrow
transplant for the amyloidosis.

607
00:26:32,935 --> 00:26:34,399
You'd have to
irradiate him first.

608
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,299
If they're right
about the blood,

609
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,300
You'd be destroying
his immune system for nothing.

610
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,799
Which could be a good thing.

611
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,200
Does he have
a really crappy life?

612
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:42,265
Go prove i'm right.

613
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,099
Do a subcutaneous
fat biopsy.

614
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,099
At least let us
eliminate the bad blood theory,

615
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,800
<i>Check the blood banks for
mis-Marks and contamination.</i>

616
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,899
You've got two hours.

617
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,365
That's completely arbitrary.

618
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,299
<i>No, if i'd said that
you got three lunar months,</i>

619
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,699
That'd be
completely arbitrary.

620
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,499
<i>Two hours is how long
it's gonna take big love</i>

621
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,299
<i>To finish a biopsy
that you guys can't do</i>

622
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,800
Because you're wasting two hours
checking blood.

623
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,000
9-3.
5- All.

624
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,200
Hey. Brought you
something from the cafeteria.

625
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,100
It's not a bribe.

626
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,300
<i>This is a bribe.</i>

627
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,799
How much?

628
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,500
$1 million.

629
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,900
$5,000.

630
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,899
This is so wrong.

631
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,799
House specifically said

632
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,799
You can use
whatever criteria you want.

633
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,100
I've got money.
You need money.

634
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,599
Hand me that slide.

635
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,899
Right now, you're earning
what i'm earning,

636
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,500
Which is miserable.

637
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,300
I know what school
your kid's at.

638
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,900
I know what it costs.

639
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,000
I've seen his picture.

640
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,900
He's gonna need braces.

641
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,299
(Kutner)
No R.B.C. Damage.

642
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,499
(Thirteen)
Nothing wrong with storage.

643
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,600
I'm gonna double-Check type
and start cultures.

644
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,800
(Foreman) We've still
got 32 minutes left.

645
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:08,999
Time flies.
What have you found?

646
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You're checking up on them-
That means cole's finished

647
00:28:11,035 --> 00:28:12,699
With the biopsy,
and it was negative.

648
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,200
Inconclusive.

649
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,099
Fat doesn't always
give you the answer.

650
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,899
Need to biopsy
his actual organs-

651
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,099
Lungs, kidneys, liver.

652
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,899
We stick another needle in him,
he'll hemorrhage.

653
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,399
Unless we start treatment
for amyloidosis.

654
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,199
Unless it's not
amyloidosis.

655
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,700
If he has an infection,
the radiation will kill him.

656
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:28,899
Show me evidence
of infection.

657
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,599
We need
more than two hours.

658
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,500
Some of these cultures will
take at least a day to grow.

659
00:28:32,535 --> 00:28:33,600
He'll be dead in a day.

660
00:28:33,635 --> 00:28:34,499
Like he predicted.

661
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,665
O. He'll be
half a day off.

662
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,265
<i>Would it make you guys
feel any better</i>

663
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,099
<i>If i let you argue with me
for... three minutes</i>

664
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,400
Before i order you to treat
for amyloidosis?

665
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,900
No. Just treat
for amyloidosis.

666
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,800
No. Don't.

667
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,299
You're playing
the cuddy card?

668
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,399
That's why i'm here.

669
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,899
Amyloidosis was your idea.

670
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,799
I was wrong.

671
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,200
Yeah, me too.
You were never fun.

672
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,300
Give me the blood.

673
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,899
I'm type ab.
Give me the blood.

674
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,299
<i>(Kutner) whatever's in
there could be killing him.</i>

675
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,300
In where?

676
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,300
How much tainted blood
do you think they keep in here?

677
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,800
How many people
would have gotten sick-

678
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,065
It would have to have been
the first batch,

679
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,900
The splenectomy-That's when
the symptoms started.

680
00:29:15,935 --> 00:29:18,600
Okay. So transfuse blood
from those donors.

681
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,799
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

682
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,300
We move on.
Treat for amyloidosis.

683
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,900
Fill 'er up.

684
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,200
(House)
I have a new theory.

685
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,600
You're not stubborn.

686
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,900
You're not
getting it checked

687
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,200
'Cause you already
know the answer.

688
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,099
I found an old picture
in your wallet.

689
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,500
Of course you did.

690
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,500
I wasn't snooping.

691
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,300
I needed lunch money.

692
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,000
Figure it's your mom,

693
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,800
Except she looks
about 32 years old.

694
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,799
The only reason
not to update a photo

695
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,000
In 20-Odd years
is she's not talking to you,

696
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,600
Which would be interesting,

697
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,700
Or she's dead.

698
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,000
Which would also
be interesting.

699
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,900
She's dead.

700
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,900
So's grover cleveland.

701
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,500
Pretty young
to have a dead mom.

702
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,200
You were even younger
20 years ago.

703
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,000
I googled her obituary.

704
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,399
Said she died
at new haven presbyterian

705
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,500
After a long illness.

706
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,100
Parkinson's?

707
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,500
Huntington's chorea.

708
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,400
I'm sorry.

709
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,800
I'm leaving
when this case is over.

710
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
No, you're not.

711
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,799
You don't want a doctor
on your team

712
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,465
Who's slowly losing control
of her body and mind.

713
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,800
Huntington's isn't the only
thing that causes tremors.

714
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,965
You think
it's just a coincidence?

715
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,500
I think you're
the only one on the team

716
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:13,400
Who drinks decaf.

717
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,599
I've been switching it out
with regular

718
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,700
<i>Ever since you dropped
that file.</i>

719
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,700
You're trembling 'cause
you're hopped up on caffeine.

720
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,099
The first file
wasn't my fault.

721
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,099
Medical explanation
for that is...

722
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,800
People drop things.

723
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,199
I've been walking around
thinking i'm dying...

724
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,265
You are.

725
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,900
You don't know that.

726
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,499
With huntington's,
it's inevitable.

727
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,600
No, you don't know,
because i don't know.

728
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,900
How could you
not get tested?

729
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,899
If your mom had it,
it's a 50% chance

730
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,199
<i>You're a bomb
waiting to explode.</i>

731
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,799
Not knowing makes me do things
i think i'm scared to do-

732
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,599
Take flying lessons,
climb kilimanjaro,

733
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,199
Work for you.

734
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,199
'Cause if you knew,

735
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,000
You couldn't do
any of those things.

736
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,499
What?

737
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,900
You're sweating.

738
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,400
You're burning up.

739
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,100
House...

740
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,100
You?

741
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,399
<i>(Kutner)
Could be pneumococcus.</i>

742
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
<i>That'd cause chest pain
and the stiff neck.</i>

743
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:22,499
It's not pneumococcus.

744
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,700
Let me check
your lymph nodes.

745
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,265
I'm not the patient.

746
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,700
<i>Patient is the one
whose body is shutting down.</i>

747
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:31,099
I'm having a benign
transfusion reaction.

748
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,599
Pseudomonas would present
as an armpit rash.

749
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,499
Take off your shirt.

750
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,199
You first.

751
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,799
House, you gotta
let us do this.

752
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,999
<i>We can't biopsy him
without bleeding him to death.</i>

753
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,499
You are not
biopsying me.

754
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,300
How's your stomach?
Any diarrhea?

755
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,199
[Exhaling]
the more transfusions you have,

756
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,800
The greater the chance
of you reacting.

757
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:48,565
<i>I've had three
in a decade.</i>

758
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,365
Fever'll be gone
in a couple of hours.

759
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,899
<i>(Thirteen) i heard somewhere
that doctors ignore symptoms</i>

760
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,365
Because they think
they can't get sick.

761
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,199
<i>(Kutner) you told us to give you
the blood so that you wouldn't-</i>

762
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,099
I am not sick.
Fever is a symptom.

763
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
But not of what
the patient has!

764
00:33:01,135 --> 00:33:01,865
<i>My kidneys are working.</i>

765
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,599
I'm not bleeding
out of every organ.

766
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,700
Yet.

767
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,365
This is a waste of time.

768
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,800
And it's distracting you
from the actual case.

769
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,365
What's wrong?

770
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,499
The room is spinning.

771
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,565
You okay?

772
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
No, i'm dizzy.

773
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,965
My mouth just went dry.

774
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,199
Could be a symptom
of any number-

775
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,400
It's a symptom of narcotics.

776
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,200
Who spiked my-

777
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,199
What'd you drug him
with?

778
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,799
Amber's nickname
is cutthroat bitch,

779
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,000
And you're pointing
at me.

780
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,900
Got the kidney sample.

781
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,400
You're the only one
with nothing to lose.

782
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,599
Could have been you.

783
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,800
You don't seem to care
if you get this job or not.

784
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,299
Yeah, i've been here
for eight weeks

785
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,400
<i>'Cause my subscription
to masochism weekly ran out.</i>

786
00:33:58,435 --> 00:33:59,600
You're the only one
who hasn't asked me

787
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:01,500
Not to put them
on the block.

788
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,700
You're either gonna pick me
or you're not.

789
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,900
You're fair enough to try
to make the right decision,

790
00:34:06,935 --> 00:34:07,999
And arrogant enough

791
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
That nothing i can say
will change your mind.

792
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,700
I don't want it
to be over, but...

793
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,400
Unless worrying about it
is gonna make a difference...

794
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,300
I'm gonna run
some stains.

795
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,000
He'll be less
of an ass to you.

796
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,100
Patient dead yet?

797
00:34:44,135 --> 00:34:45,100
No.

798
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,599
That's a little much
for a first date.

799
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,300
Obviously,
you've never dated me.

800
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,900
Feels like you already
got the...

801
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,999
Lung and kidney samples.

802
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,399
Now i just need
a piece of your liver.

803
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,699
Hey, you might wanna use
a little lidocaine-

804
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh, yeah, i forgot.

805
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Oh!
Slight pinch.

806
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,900
You drugged me.

807
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,800
You drugged me.

808
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,800
Stopped by the lab.

809
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,299
Your mutinous team
is starting to worry

810
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
About life
on pitcairn island.

811
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,300
All your biopsies
are clean.

812
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,400
Because there's
nothing wrong with me.

813
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,300
Did foreman finally okay

814
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,199
The amyloidosis treatment?

815
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Patient's scheduled
for irradiation at 9:00.

816
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,100
You risked your life again.

817
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,599
You couldn't be sure
he had amyloidosis.

818
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,299
You can't be sure
that i couldn't be sure.

819
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,799
You did one test.
It was negative.

820
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,499
Inconclusive.

821
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,799
Well, then, by all means

822
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,699
Flood your body
with possibly lethal blood.

823
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,699
I usually like to give
the lethal blood to foreman,

824
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,599
But i'm the only one
who's type ab.

825
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,800
<i>Of course.
You're type ab.</i>

826
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,900
Universal recipient.

827
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,500
You take from everybody.

828
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:28,017
Course, you're type o-

829
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,500
<i>Universal donor.</i>

830
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,900
No wonder you're paying
three alimonies.

831
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,800
How do you know...
what blood type i am?

832
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,000
I don't.
Just seemed to fit the metaphor.

833
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:40,400
No, no, no, no, no.

834
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,500
Did you test my blood
for something?

835
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,400
<i>Why would you test
my blood for something?</i>

836
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:47,200
I didn't.

837
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,299
You must have...
told me what you were.

838
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,799
<i>Who the hell chats
about their blood type?</i>

839
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,600
You had to have
tested me.

840
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,800
There's no reason to ask
anyone their blood type.

841
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,600
You're about to run
out of here, aren't you?

842
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,900
Nurse, can i have
a moment with my patient?

843
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,100
He's due
in radiation.

844
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,600
It's too late.
He's dying.

845
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,500
Told you.

846
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,500
I'm sorry i doubted you.

847
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,200
Be a shame if your secrets
died with you.

848
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,100
Perhaps you've got that trick
written down somewhere?

849
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,300
Or maybe you wanna tell me,
and i'll write it down for you.

850
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,000
That way...
you can live on.

851
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,600
I'm taking it with me.

852
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,499
See, that way,

853
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,400
It stays magic.

854
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,100
You were wrong
about everything.

855
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,500
It was never magic,
and you're not dying.

856
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,600
What's your blood type?

857
00:37:58,635 --> 00:38:00,100
T- Type a.

858
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,899
What?

859
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,400
Trust me.
It's way cooler to know.

860
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,000
(Coleman)
where's finn?

861
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,900
Up my sleeve.

862
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,000
It's not amyloidosis.

863
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,765
And his blood's fine.

864
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,665
We just gave him
the wrong type.

865

<i>'Caused the DIC.,

Multisystem failures.

867
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,399
But we tested his blood.

868
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,500
That's because
we don't test blood for type.

869
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,999
We test for antibodies.

870
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,799
'Cause your body
only makes those antibodies

871
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,700
When you actually have
that type of blood.

872
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,699
Apparently,
he has one more symptom.

873
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,499
His body's making
an extra antibody-Type b.

874
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,649
Combine that with his
natural type a,

875
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,799
And presto change-O,
he magically pulls

876
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Blood type ab
out of his hat.

877
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
Would you stop that?
God, yes!

it's happened again.

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,399
<i>Flush him with saline.</i>

883
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,100
Transfuse four units type a.
Start him on steroids.

884
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:01,300
He'll be back
hoodwinking idiots in no time.

885
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,700
Use their power wisely,
my lord.

886
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,200
I nominate... amber.

887
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,600
<i>Cutthroat bitch...</i>

888
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:49,300
Rise.

889
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,565
You're surprised?

890
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,700
You're everyone's pick.
Next victim.

891
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,800
I nominate...

892
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,900
Kutner.

893
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,599
Now everyone's surprised.

894
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,700
Why?

895
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,365
You said i don't have
to justify my picks.

896
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,800
<i>No. I said you could use
whatever criteria you want.</i>

897
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,300
<i>Doesn't mean
i don't wanna know.</i>

898
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,500
He was right
about this being a real case.

899
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,299
He was right
about the botched transfusion.

900
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,800
And he's
your love nugget.

901
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,700
<i>You got no reason
to pick him.</i>

902
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,700
But somebody else does.

903
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Kutner's a liability.

904
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,900
<i>He electrocuted himself,
lit a patient on fire.</i>

905
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,699
It's only a matter of time

906
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
Before he burns
the hospital down.

907
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,400
You made the deal
with cuddy.

908
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,900
That's how you got
her underwear.

909
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,399
She sold it to you

910
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,799
For the right to put
her choices on the block.

911
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,700
You said
get her underwear.

912
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,600
I got it.

913
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,900
Your scheme was brilliant.

914
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,000
And you're fired.

915
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,000
You're all about
breaking the rules.

916
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,100
Her rules, not mine.

917
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,600
The whole point of this
was to subvert cuddy.

918
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:19,499
You became her partner,

919
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,599
<i>Gave her power
she didn't already have.</i>

920
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,350
Let her greedy fingers
into my cookie jar,

921
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:27,100
Which, sadly, is not
as dirty as it sounds.

922
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,900
Thanks for playing.

923
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,400
What the hell is this?

924
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,999
Looks like an envelope
with the results

925
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,700
Of the genetic test
for huntington's inside.

926
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:08,100
Did you look?

927
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,300
I thought it'd be fun
to find out together.

928
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,099
I don't want to know.

929
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,699
No. You're afraid
to know.

930
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,965
I might die.
So could you.

931
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,599
You could get hit
by a bus tomorrow.

932
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,200
The only difference is you don't
have to know about it today,

933
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,565
So why should i?

934
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,000
I don't have to know
the lottery numbers.

935
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,400
But if someone offered
them to me, i'd take them.

936
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,900
You spend your whole life
looking for answers...

937
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,100
Because you think the next
answer will change something,

938
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,200
Maybe make you
a little less miserable.

939
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,000
And you know that when
you run out of questions,

940
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:43,500
You don't just
run out of answers.

941
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,500
You run out of hope.

942
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,265
You glad you know that?
