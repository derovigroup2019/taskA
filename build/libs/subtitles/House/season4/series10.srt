1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,700
You okay?

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,865
I'm thinking.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,600
Thinking's not gonna
get you to the top.

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,300
Mom, you're supposed
to be encouraging me.

5
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:14,065
No, i'm supposed to
be coaching you.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,200
The slower you go, the
more tired you're gonna get.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,400
There's a hold about a
foot above you on the left.

8
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:27,400
I know.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Nice grab.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,900
Keep going,
you're almost there, babe.

11
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,365
I can't.
My calf's cramping.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,500
You need to get off
your toes.

13
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:38,600
Get on the ball
of your foot.

14
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:39,165
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,300
You can get all the
way to the top.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,565
It's okay, i got you.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,500
You all right?
Looks like you were wrong.

18
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:53,065
Yeah, but you did awesome.

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,265
That's the highest
you've gotten.

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,600
I'm proud of you.
I don't feel so good.

21
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, come on down.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,900
Mom?

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
Mom, are you okay?

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Oh, god.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,465
- Are you all right?
- My arm... I think i broke it.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,400
Don't move.
God, Jane, i'm so sorry.

27
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:23,300
What happened?
Did the rope break? -No.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,500
My hands...

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,900
I can't move them.

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,965
She's been to an ortho,

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,200
Two neuros,
and an immunologist.

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,100
None of the treatments
have had any effect.

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,200
You think it's over?
It's getting worse.

37
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:14,017
Last neurologist found
intermittent numbness

38
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,800
In both arms as well
as the hand paralysis.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,765
I meant the game.

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,200
You think he's gonna keep
all four of us?

41
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,200
He said he would.

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,300
No sign of upper
motor neuron involvement.

43
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:22,100
He lies.

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
My ears are burning.

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,200
Tell 'em you're done
firing people.

46
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,400
Well, if i lie...

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,700
That would be
little reassurance.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Dr. Kutner,

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,100
Who told you that
it would be a good idea

50
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:36,000
To put up
superficial representations

51
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:37,300
Of a hypocritical season

52
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,600
Celebrating a mythical figure?

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,600
It wasn't me.

54
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,000
He lied.

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
Homey knows better,

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,865
Hymie doesn't care,

57
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,100
And Huntington's would
have done a better job.

58
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,300
I don't have Huntington's.

59
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,465
That you know of.

60
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,300
Why would you-
Because i got sued

61
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:54,100
When i called you "Honeybuns. "

62
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,365
Am i fired if i put up-

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,900
The point of the game
was to scare us.

64
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:58,365
Telling us it's over isn't scary.

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,800
Therefore he has no
reason to say that

66
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:00,900
Unless it's true.

67
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,900
Good.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,300
Then can we do
a secret santa?

69
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,100
I liked you better
15 seconds ago

70
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:09,500
When you were afraid
for your job.

71
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,065
So who's sick?

72
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,700
35-Year-Old single mom.

73
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,800
It's an odd presentation
of paralysis.

74
00:03:14,835 --> 00:03:16,500
Is there any history of drug use? No.

75
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:18,100
She says
there's no history.

76
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,400
She's not a liar.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,165
Okay, this is gonna be
a tough case.

78
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
I have almost no knowledge
of alien physiology.

79
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,700
Everyone lies, but there's
an exception to every rule.

80
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:28,765
Actually, there isn't.

81
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,765
That's kinda
what makes it a rule.

82
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
The patient's mother
died of breast cancer

83
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:32,065
When she was seven.

84
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,600
She never even knew
her mom was sick.

85
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:34,365
She promised herself

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,500
She would never hide anything
from her own daughter.

87
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,900
Oh, i didn't know
she promised.

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,500
And we're not her daughter.

89
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,100
The patient inherited
the brca1 mutation

90
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:44,665
From her mom.

91
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,100
She got a prophylactic
double mastectomy ten years ago.

92
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:47,965
She lied about it.

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,900
She told her co-Workers.
She told her kid.

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,500
She lied to the world.

95
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,000
Reconstructive surgery is
designed to convince people-

96
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,700
She didn't get
reconstructive surgery.

97
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,600
Okay, we can rule out
breast cancer.

98
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,200
Actually, i was gonna
rule it in.

99
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:01,700
Paralysis could be
paraneoplastic.

100
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,500
Even the best surgeon
can't remove

101
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,800
Every cell
of breast tissue.

102
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,900
Mri what's left
of her chest.

103
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,100
Set the machine
to scan for irony.

104
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,100
I'm gonna go redo
the patient history.

105
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Your mom tell you
about all the drugs she does?

106
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,700
She smokes pot
once in a while,

107
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:26,400
But not in a long time.

108
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,600
What about you?

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,000
How would that
make her sick?

110
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,300
Are you a doctor?

111
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,900
I'm 11.

112
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,300
That's not an answer.

113
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,300
That's an evasion.

114
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,000
Like drinking?

115
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,265
You ever sneak a drink?

116
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,700
I don't do any of that stuff.
It's bad for you.

117
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,200
I understand why you don't want
your mom to know.

118
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,400
But i'm her doctor, so-
I would tell my mom.

119
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,000
And i would tell you.
Why?

120
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,900
Because she would never lie
to me.

121
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
What's her favorite way
to have sex?

122
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,100
I don't get what sex has to do
with breast cancer.

123
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:01,500
Are you a doctor?

124
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,200
Did you go to med school
since the last time i asked?

125
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:05,900
You just think
we've got to be lying to-

126
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:07,500
White lies?
What are those?

127
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:08,800
Those are lies we tell

128
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,600
To make other people
feel better.

129
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,765
I don't lie.

130
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,765
Rationalizations?
What are those?

131
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,100
Those are lies we tell
to make ourselves feel better.

132
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:17,565
No, we don't...

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Lies of omission?

134
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,900
Saddle bronc or doggie?

135
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,400
That's sex talk.

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,265
She used to like being
on top.

137
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,900
But now she likes to be
on her stomach.

138
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,800
That way she doesn't
have to see them

139
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,700
Looking at her scars.

140
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,000
It's child abuse.

141
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,300
Honesty?

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,700
There's a reason
that everybody lies-

143
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:51,600
It works.

144
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,000
It's what allows society
to function.

145
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:55,700
It's what separates man
from beast.

146
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,500
Oh, i thought that was
our thumbs.

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
You wanna know every place
your mom's thumb has been?

148
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:00,765
I'm sorry,
i missed rehearsal.

149
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
Am i taking
the "truth is good" side?

150
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:04,365
Don't you usually take
that part?

151
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,300
Lies are a tool
to be used either for good...

152
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,500
No, wait.
I got a better one.

153
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,800
Lies are like children.

154
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,800
Hard work,
but they're worth it,

155
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:14,400
Because the future depends
on 'em.

156
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,100
You are so full of love...
or something.

157
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,700
When you care
about someone-

158
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:23,800
You lie to them!

159
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,800
You pretend that their
constant ponderous musings

160
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:27,700
Are interesting.

161
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,000
You tell them that
they're not losing

162
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,167
Their boyish good looks

163
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:31,300
Or becoming worn out and-

164
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:32,265
I stand corrected.

165
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,800
And may i say it's been
a real pleasure

166
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:34,765
Chatting with you.

167
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,400
Axilla's clean.
Surgical margins look clear.

168
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:40,000
No lymphadenopathy,
no masses, no nothing.

169
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,300
It's not cancer.

170
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,100
We need a new theory.

171
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
You catch her lying?
Not yet.

172
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,000
Wouldn't "no" have been
a shorter answer?

173
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:49,500
Wouldn't you not talking
have made this

174
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:50,800
A shorter conversation?

175
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,565
Kid says mom's a slut.

176
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,850
She called her mom
a slut?

177
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:55,065
No, i called her mom
a slut.

178
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100
She jumps anything
with a pole and a pulse.

179
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,465
Not that i'm judging here.

180
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,265
Given her medical history,
i'm actually impressed.

181
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,500
Maggie already admitted to
having multiple sexual partners,

182
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:03,765
Which is why we already
tested for

183
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,350
And ruled out syphilis
and any other std

184
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:07,342
That could have caused
her symptoms.

185
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:09,300
Stds aren't the only risk
in risky sex.

186
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,800
The problem in sleeping
with strangers is

187
00:07:11,835 --> 00:07:12,800
They're strange.

188
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,400
We'll follow up
with any recent partners.

189
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,000
Send foreman and taub.
They're better liars.

190
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,800
More likely to get
to the truth.

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
You think i drugged her?

192
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:28,500
Use a coaster.

193
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,900
We're not cops.

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,100
Legally, we don't care
one way or another.

195
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,400
But we need to know the truth
so we can help her.

196
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:35,667
I'd known her
for less than an hour,

197
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:37,101
And she offered
to take me home.

198
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:38,500
There was no need
to drug her.

199
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,700
Not that i would.

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,365
She's gonna be okay, right?

201
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,300
As long as she doesn't have
to pick up or hold anything.

202
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:48,200
Yeah.

203
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,600
Sorry, i just had
the floors done.

204
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,900
Reclaimed pine.

205
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,300
You always this thirsty?

206
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,800
I don't know.

207
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,400
Water's supposed to be
good for you, right?

208
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,865
Dehydration, anxiety,

209
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,750
Aggression...
i'm not aggressive.

210
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:08,600
Spastic chorea
in his right hand.

211
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,565
What about my hand?

212
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,100
How much you weigh?
About 180, 190?

213
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:13,065
180.
What is the-

214
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,865
If you took
what she did,

215
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,400
It could take longer
to hit you.

216
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,800
It might affect you
differently.

217
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,300
But you didn't give her
anything... right?

218
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,800
She was really drunk.

219
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,000
I just gave her some "e"

220
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,600
To help enhance things.

221
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,800
Have any of it left?

222
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,065
Is my hand gonna be okay?

223
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,300
There's nothing wrong
with it.

224
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
We lied.

225
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,200
I've had a sore throat
for a few days now.

226
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
My stomach's
also been bothering me.

227
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
I think my glands
are swollen.

228
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Saint nicholas?

229
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,165
Patron saint of children.

230
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,700
Also seamen,
merchants, archers,

231
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,200
Prostitutes,
and prisoners.

232
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,300
Hmm, must've been
pretty hard-Working.

233
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,300
Or just a credit hog.

234
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,300
Open wide.

235
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,300
Say ahh.
Ahh...

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,200
You have strep.

237
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,200
Is it contagious?

238
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,065
Only for the next
24 hours,

239
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,500
As long as you take
the antibiotics.

240
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,600
How contagious?

241
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,400
Take a personal day.

242
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
I can't.

243
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,700
I'll write your pimp
a note.

244
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,000
My pimp?

245
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
You're tested for aids
every three months,

246
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:26,600
And your necklace.

247
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,200
Prostitutes wear
religious symbols.

248
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,100
I think they just
like kneeling.

249
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,765
You don't have the skin
of a seaman,

250
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,900
The fingers of an archer,
the clothes of a merchant,

251
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:38,617
Or the attitude
of an ex-Con.

252
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:40,300
So it just leaves
one left.

253
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,900
Two, actually.

254
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,000
But i'm not a child,
am i?

255
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,200
You owe me 50 bucks.

256
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,500
Then you owe me
half a lap dance.

257
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,900
It's for the nurses'
holiday bonus.

258
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:05,117
I know you got
the memo.

259
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:06,300
I got the memo last year.

260
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,200
I want to hire
40 more fellows.

261
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,300
You already fired
the ones you hired?

262
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:11,900
They work better
when they're scared.

263
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,000
You were right.
Guy slipped her ecstasy.

264
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,800
He have any symptoms?

265
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,800
No.

266
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,600
Kutner's starting the patient
on hemodialysis,

267
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:20,300
And thirteen's in the lab
trying to figure out

268
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:21,400
What the guy put
in the drugs.

269
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,900
See?

270
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,100
A clear, simple
statement of facts

271
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:28,365
Describing their
cooperation

272
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,700
With absolutely no attitude
or fear.

273
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,900
Something's gotta be done.

274
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,900
Oh, yeah.

275
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,600
How are you feeling?

276
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,650
I still can't move
my hands.

277
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:39,965
It'll take a few
more hours

278
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,700
To cycle all your blood
through the machine.

279
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,200
What just happened?

280
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,900
Nothing.
What's wrong?

281
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,100
What do you mean?
The lights just went out.

282
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Didn't they?

283
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,900
What did you do?

284
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,265
Is this from the drugs?

285
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,000
Most of the drugs should be
out of your system by now.

286
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:56,617
And our drugs-
I can't see.

287
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,200
Do something.
I can't see.

288
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,900
I can't see!

289
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Nothing in the ecstasy
except ecstasy.

290
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,100
Well, that never hurt anybody.

291
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,000
It can't make 'em blind
days later.

292
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,100
Do you spell "Homie"
with a "Y"?

293
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
I want to be respectful.

294
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,800
You're actually gonna let us do
secret santa?

295
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,000
Not just you guys.

296
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,200
I like presents too.

297
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,000
Pick a name.

298
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,365
Why are you doing this?

299
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,500
See, this is why
no one likes your people.

300
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,050
The notion of picking
one time of the year

301
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,692
To be decent to other people
is obscene,

302
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,265
'Cause it's actually
validating the notion

303
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,200
Of being miserable wretches
the rest of the year.

304
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,900
So you think this is
the part of the year

305
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:39,800
That's screwed up?

306
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,000
On the other hand,
you are now a team.

307
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,100
You've gotta work together.

308
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,000
And the simple fact is,
giving people crap

309
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:45,700
Makes people like people.

310
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:46,817
So spend 25 bucks.

311
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:47,900
Learn to love.

312
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,000
Blindness could be
a complication

313
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:51,265
From the hemodialysis.

314
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,600
No, the dialysate composition
was within range.

315
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,000
Sweet.
Interesting.

316
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,800
Dialysate composition
just indicates-

317
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:00,667
Nothing.
I was referring to his reaction

318
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:02,151
To the name he got.
I was pleased.

319
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:03,600
I thought it would be fun
to buy-

320
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:04,765
Means there's someone here

321
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
It wouldn't be fun
to buy for.

322
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,800
I wonder who.

323
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,100
Pick a name.

324
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,100
Then go check out
the patient's house.

325
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,200
Interesting.

326
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,400
We're wasting time
going to the home.

327
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,700
Kearns-Sayre syndrome
fits the symptoms.

328
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:22,100
No family history
of kearns.

329
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:22,865
Go to their house-

330
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,500
She would have told us
if there were any other drugs.

331
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,165
You met her.

332
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,065
She couldn't have been
more candid.

333
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,000
You're absolutely right.
Go to their house-

334
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:29,767
Ms or vascular problem
fits better.

335
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:31,500
They could affect hands
and eyes.

336
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,765
Fine, do an mri,
check for ms.

337
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,200
And a fluorescein angiogram
of her eyes

338
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:37,600
To see if we missed
a bleed somewhere.

339
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,600
Oh, and whoever goes
to their house,

340
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,200
Get me their computers.

341
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,400
You talk to your kid
about sex

342
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:44,900
So she'll think

343
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,600
You're being open
about everything.

344
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,000
Keeps her from asking questions
about the things

345
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,200
You don't want
to talk about.

346
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,865
That's right.

347
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,300
Her honesty proves
just how dishonest she is.

348
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:54,800
Yes!
Exactly who i wanted.

349
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,300
This is gonna be fun.

350
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,200
The dye may sting
when it enters your bloodstream.

351
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,200
Are you scared, mom?

352
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,800
Yeah. Are you?

353
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Yeah.

354
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Are they?

355
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,200
They don't look scared.

356
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Either they're confident
or they just don't care.

357
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,900
We're confident.

358
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,100
Okay if i shift you a bit?

359
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,600
Get you into position.

360
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,500
Your boss is weird.

361
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,500
Yeah, he is.

362
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,265
He thought he'd
get information

363
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,000
You may not have been telling us by
- Being a jerk?

364
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
You'd be surprised
how often it works.

365
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,000
Choroidal flush looks good.

366
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,800
Why would people lie
to a doctor?

367
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,365
Dozens of reasons to lie,

368
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,000
Only one reason
to tell the truth.

369
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,400
You're never even tempted?

370
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,500
I mean, lies do sometimes
smooth things out,

371
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:55,965
Make life easier.

372
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,300
Yeah?
Your life easy?

373
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,500
Not even close.

374
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,300
The dye has reached
the retinal capillary bed.

375
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,700
No leakage.

376
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,600
That's good, right?

377
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,000
It means it's not
a vascular problem.

378
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,165
What?

379
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,100
A vascular problem
we could fix.

380
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,600
They look worried now, mom.

381
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,965
What's with
the secret santa?

382
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
You trying
to bring them together?

383
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,800
I want to drive them
apart.

384
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,700
With gift giving?

385
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,665
Conflict's built
right into the name.

386
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,900
Santa's about sharing.
A secret's about withholding.

387
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Aside from the trojan horse,
gifts don't usually-

388
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:39,667
What'd you get your wife

389
00:14:39,702 --> 00:14:40,900
For your final
anniversary?

390
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,165
Uh... a sweater.

391
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,100
She hated it.
She loved it.

392
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Then you didn't buy it.

393
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,900
I gave her some cash...

394
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,900
And...

395
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,965
Gifts allow us
to demonstrate

396
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Exactly how little we know
about a person.

397
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:57,465
And nothing pisses off
a person more

398
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,400
Than being shoved
in the wrong pigeonhole.

399
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,400
Yes.

400
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,500
I'm thinking of spending
a few extra bucks

401
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:05,500
On my secret santa.

402
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,500
Bad idea.

403
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,200
You mind if i tell house
you asked them for the key

404
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:09,165
Instead of breaking in?

405
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,900
Yes, i do.
Just another five bucks.

406
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:11,665
Five will be ten.

407
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,500
The key's proof she doesn't
have anything to hide.

408
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:14,900
The key is proof
i didn't do exactly

409
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:15,865
What house told me
to do.

410
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,300
And what do you care
if it's another $15?

411
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:18,265
I'm gonna tell him.

412
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,600
Who are you so anxious
to please?

413
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,800
Not you.

414
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,600
You really think
you're going to prove

415
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:23,965
People are capable
of honesty

416
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,950
Using a mother and daughter
you've known for one day?

417
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:27,900
I'm not the one who's
based his entire world view

418
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:29,067
On the proposition.

419
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:30,200
If i'm wrong, so what?

420
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:31,000
If he's wrong...

421
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
So you've got
huntington's?

422
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,565
Nope.
But house said that you-

423
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
If i wanted to talk about it,
why didn't i bring it up?

424
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,900
Fluorescein angiogram
was clear.

425
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:45,165
No leaks, no lesions.

426
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,100
Definitely not
a vascular problem.

427
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,700
Someone get their birthdays
out of the file.

428
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,800
Have you tried
leaving it blank?

429
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,400
Tough to get into the head
of someone

430
00:15:57,435 --> 00:15:59,000
Who actually
trusts people, huh?

431
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,000
Found both computers
in an office

432
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:03,800
On a desk they share.

433
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,500
No sign of macular degeneration
or optic neuritis.

434
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:07,967
Her eyes are
completely normal.

435
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:09,400
Except she can't see
out of them.

436
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,800
So she says.

437
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,200
Find anything
on the mri?

438
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,900
No sign of plaques.
It's not ms.

439
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,500
We haven't found
anything abnormal

440
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:17,165
On any test.

441
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,000
Except she can't see
or move her hands.

442
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:20,000
So she says.

443
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,600
You can't lie about
flaccid paralysis.

444
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,100
Maybe she's not lying.

445
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,565
Her brain is.

446
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
What if it's
a conversion disorder?

447
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,900
Lacks personal boundaries...

448
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Promiscuous...

449
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,200
Inappropriate obsession
with truth telling.

450
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,700
Certainly sounds
like a psych case.

451
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,150
Cool, i'll set up
a psych consult,

452
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:42,800
Start her
on anti-Depressants.

453
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,700
No.

454
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,400
Her mind is tricking
her body.

455
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,000
We need to trick
her mind.

456
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,600
Or even better.

457
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
You don't need her.

458
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,065
I know.

459
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,865
Then this serves
no medical purpose.

460
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,600
You have a genetic defect,
choose to ignore it.

461
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,600
This woman has
a genetic defect.

462
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:07,100
She chooses
to butcher herself

463
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:08,000
To be safe.

464
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,000
Yet what you claim
to be fascinated by

465
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Is her honesty.

466
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,500
Interesting.

467
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,600
You claim to want
the truth...

468
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,000
And then you screw
with people

469
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,400
Who actually live by it.

470
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,600
- Pathetic.
- Hey, i gave you credit for "interesting. "

471
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,700
You're protecting her
because you're jealous

472
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:25,100
She did
what you couldn't.

473
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
I need you.

474
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
I'm not lying to her.

475
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,100
Fine, keep your mouth shut.
I still need you.

476
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,300
If it doesn't work,
you gotta hold the kid down

477
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,700
Until someone else finishes
lying to mom.

478
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
That does actually serve
a medical purpose.

479
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,200
Jane.

480
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,200
I have to lie
because she trusts me?

481
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:52,300
If you show doubt,

482
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,600
The placebo treatment
won't work.

483
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,500
If it's just depression,
that's good news, right?

484
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,500
There are a lot
of great medications.

485
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:00,900
Then why can't we just
give her those?

486
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,400
Why do we have to lie
to her?

487
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Because we might be wrong.

488
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,150
And those medications take
a long time to work,

489
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:09,000
And since you're mom's condition
is declining...

490
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,700
There's a chance the drugs
won't tell us anything

491
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:12,800
Until it's too late.

492
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,000
My mom's not depressed.

493
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,600
Maybe she's hiding it from you. No.

494
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,165
She wouldn't-

495
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,700
She's doing what
every good mom does:

496
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,400
Protecting her child
from bad news

497
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,800
That she can't
do anything about.

498
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:26,317
My mom's never lied to me.

499
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:27,800
If you don't know how to lie,

500
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,000
You don't know how to tell
when you're being lied to.

501
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Maybe you're right.

502
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,100
I know-
I was lying.

503
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,500
I know how to lie.

504
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
I just won't do it
to my mother.

505
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,400
You like foosball?

506
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,900
Until the treatment
of your infectious paraparesis

507
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:57,900
Takes effect,

508
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,500
Jane can't come back
into the room.

509
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,900
I've already been
inoculated.

510
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,200
Can she have it already?

511
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,265
Don't worry,

512
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,865
It's a very effective
treatment.

513
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,500
You should be feeling better
in a matter of minutes.

514
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,700
Don't you think jane deserves
a few secrets?

515
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,965
Some personal space-

516
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Room to, uh...
make her own mistakes?

517
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,900
She makes plenty
of mistakes.

518
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,600
Only difference is i'm there
to help her through them.

519
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,600
But she's gotta know you're
looking over her shoulder.

520
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,365
It's gotta stifle-

521
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,250
I think the world would be
a better place

522
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:31,100
If everybody always acted
like their mom was

523
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:32,300
Looking over their shoulder.

524
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
I want to go see my mom.

525
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:47,100
She's sleeping.

526
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,700
Why don't we just double
the amount we can spend?

527
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:50,500
Nope.
Can't afford another $25?

528
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,800
If we allow people $50,
people will spend $60.

529
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:54,367
Oh, so you can't afford
another $35.

530
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,900
You must really like
who you got.

531
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,100
Or really dislike.

532
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,365
My mom always gives
the best presents

533
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,200
To the teachers
i get along with the worst.

534
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
No.
No.

535
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,800
How do you know "no"?

536
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,600
I know you didn't
get house.

537
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,000
I know he didn't get house.

538
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,800
You gave themall your name?

539
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,800
Mm-Hmm.

540
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,750
Figured i could sow
some dissention

541
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:24,500
And get a few ties
and sweaters.

542
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,500
What happens
when they find out?

543
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,400
It's secret santa.

544
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,400
And what happens
when they find out?

545
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,200
They'll argue about what to do
with that information.

546
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
The ties are less important
than the dissention.

547
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,200
We still have to
buy him something.

548
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:39,165
Not a chance.

549
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,500
We weren't supposed
to discuss this.

550
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:41,365
We're not supposed to know.

551
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,300
He's not supposed to put
his name in there five times.

552
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,900
He wants presents.

553
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,265
It's sad.

554
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,500
It's pathetic.

555
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,400
I'm still buying him
a present.

556
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:51,800
No, you're not.

557
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,600
Fine!

558
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,300
What's wrong?

559
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,100
I think it's getting worse.

560
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,500
I can't breathe.

561
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,600
I need a nurse in here!

562
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,900
The lymph nodes are
cutting off her airway.

563
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:19,900
We've got to intubate!

564
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,900
The swollen lymph nowere cutting

565
00:21:32,935 --> 00:21:33,700
Maggie's airway.

566
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,200
We shrunk 'em with alcohol.
She's breathing on her own now.

567
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,200
That sucks.

568
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,665
4,300 saved emails,

569
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,200
And not a single mention
of "lesbionic," "sanchez,"

570
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,200
Or "Man-Gina. "

571
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,100
Swollen lymph nodes means

572
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:47,300
It wasn't psychological.

573
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,000
Who's that from?

574
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,100
Santa, obviously.

575
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,600
'Cause you know
i worship him.

576
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,200
No, wait, i mean satan.

577
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,000
I always get 'em confused.

578
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,700
What is an alpine butterfly?

579
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,650
And why is she learning
how to do one?

580
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:03,065
House, we already have
a full history.

581
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
You don't need to waste time
- It's just a climbing knot.

582
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:07,200
But what does she use it for?
Try bondage.

583
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,800
I did once.

584
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,500
She just tied me down and whined
about how hard it is

585
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:12,600
To be dean of medicine.

586
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,165
Gyms aren't exactly
pristine.

587
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,600
Could be a fungal infection.
Seriously, who's it from?

588
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,100
No fever,
no elevated white count.

589
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:20,400
Ah! That's funny.

590
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,400
Her friend sent her
a garfield cartoon.

591
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,800
That cat sure does
love lasagna.

592
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,600
House!

593
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,900
Stop obsessing.

594
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,800
If it weren't
for my obsessions,

595
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,500
You wouldn't know
that she has sarcoidosis.

596
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,200
18 months ago she sold
her stairmaster.

597
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,665
It was only two months old.

598
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,100
Now, eithershe needed the cash,
or climbing stairs

599
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:42,100
Was getting more difficult.

600
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,200
12 months ago,
she canceled a hiking trip.

601
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,100
Now, either she just wanted
to sit home and watch tv,

602
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:49,800
Or walking was getting
more difficult.

603
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,600
She's been suffering joint pain
for the last two years.

604
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,600
Pull my ribbon,
if you know what i mean.

605
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,900
A.C.E. Levels are too low
for sarcoidosis.

606
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
That's not what i meant.

607
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,400
Could just be an inactive phase.

608
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:04,165
It's not christmas yet.

609
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,500
I remembered i'm not a satanist,
i'm a druid.

610
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:08,065
No lung involvement.
Yet.

611
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,200
We'll need a bronchoalveolar
lavage to confirm it.

612
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,165
That's a shame-

613
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,000
I was gonna surprise her
with one for christmas.

614
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Wow!

615
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,700
Now, either that cost more
than 25 bucks

616
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:22,317
Or i'm seriously
starting to doubt

617
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:23,900
Steve jobs' business strategies.

618
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
But thanks!

619
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,800
Last round of saline, maggie.

620
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,200
One more big breath.

621
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,700
We've gotta get the liquid
to go all the way

622
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:36,100
Into your lungs, okay?

623
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,600
Here we go.

624
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,300
The gift could be
from a patient.

625
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,900
Who sent it
to the wrong doctor?

626
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,000
House obviously
gave the present to himself.

627
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,700
They're arguing right now.

628
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,700
I've been looking for this
all morning.

629
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,100
Did you look in the box
on my desk?

630
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,800
Oh, by the way,
your mom called.

631
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:00,000
Your dad's dead.

632
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
You left the present sitting
on your desk?

633
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:04,517
It wouldn't have been
as effective

634
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:05,700
Sitting in a closet
in my home.

635
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,100
They're gonna know
it's from you.

636
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,700
No, they're gonna guess
that it was from me.

637
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,700
Might even be 90% sure
that it was from me,

638
00:24:10,735 --> 00:24:13,165
But all that means is
they're 10% sure

639
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
That one of the other guys
is screwing them over.

640
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,050
Have you ever considered
channeling your powers

641
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:21,500
To, i don't know,
bring peace to the mid-East?

642
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,900
I couldn't do that.

643
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,400
But if they ever got it,
you could screw it up?

644
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,700
Yeah, that's more where
my powers lie.

645
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,600
Gift could be from wilson.
It's house.

646
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,100
Why do you have a problem
with him speculating?

647
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:34,600
Because that's what house
wants us to do.

648
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,765
Lungs are pristine.

649
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,200
No infiltrates
or alveolar hemorrhage.

650
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:39,667
Maggie, i'm gonna remove
the scope.

651
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:41,100
I need you to cough
for me, okay?

652
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,700
A little harder.

653
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,500
Great.

654
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,700
Maggie, open your eyes.

655
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,900
Why aren't you saying anything?

656
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,700
What's wrong?

657
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,300
Maggie tested negative
for sarcoidosis.

658
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:09,000
But she's bleeding
into her eyes now.

659
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,465
Have her platelets dropped?

660
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,300
Plummeted. New labs show
they're under 40.

661
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:14,500
She'll bleed out
of every orifice

662
00:25:14,535 --> 00:25:15,365
If we don't find the cause.

663
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,500
Could be splenic sequestration,
tuberculosis...

664
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:18,965
Gaucher disease, ttp-

665
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,065
Hemolytic uremic syndrome,
sepsis-

666
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,600
Listing all the possible causes
is only impressive

667
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:25,300
If you can do it
reverse-Alphabetically.

668
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,000
We need to know why
her platelet machine is broken.

669
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,900
Go to the factory.
Do a bone marrow aspiration.

670
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm your secret santa.

671
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,400
You're not supposed to tell.

672
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,000
But you got a present
already.

673
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,100
Which means you have
more than one secret santa.

674
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,100
Or somebody else wants
to make me happy.

675
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,100
Merry christmas.

676
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
On one hand,
you should be in bed.

677
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,400
And on the other hand,
i told you to rest.

678
00:26:21,435 --> 00:26:23,000
So i see your dilemma.

679
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,200
I don't think resting is
the problem.

680
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,300
Can strep cause this?

681
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,200
Clap on...

682
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,200
Trust me,
first place i went.

683
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,800
No rash on my labia.

684
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,100
Do you need to take
a look?

685
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,400
I'm saving my money
for a red ryder bb gun.

686
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,600
Darker shade of lipstick?

687
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,500
I'm not wearing any.

688
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,700
You tell your mother
what you do?

689
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,200
It doesn't matter.
I'm curious.

690
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,900
I don't need to break her heart
just so i can feel righteous.

691
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,600
Do you do a donkey show?

692
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm not curious.
It matters.

693
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,100
It's a donkey or a mule.

694
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,300
I can never remember.

695
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,600
Wow...

696
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,500
That is a creepy smile.

697
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,200
I bet the donkey's is
even creepier.

698
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,650
Do i have to explain?

699
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:31,200
Nope.
That's my job.

700
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,000
Contagious ecthyma.

701
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,300
Any contact can cause rashes,
flu symptoms,

702
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:37,200
Sore throat.

703
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,900
Has there been... contact?

704
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,300
Okay, antibiotic cream
for you,

705
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,800
And a love glove
for francis.

706
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,500
You'll both be fine.

707
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,100
You should come see the show.

708
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,400
I think you'd like it.

709
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,400
Sorry, i hate westerns.

710
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,000
So they really never lie?

711
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,200
Doesn't seem like it.

712
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,200
Admirable.

713
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
You tell cameron
everything?

714
00:28:18,535 --> 00:28:19,700
Ha! No.

715
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,900
You think she keeps secrets?

716
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
If i knew,
they wouldn't be secrets.

717
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
I hope she does.

718
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,700
People have a right
to a little privacy,

719
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:29,000
Even from the people
they love.

720
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,600
You buy house a present?

721
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,300
Why would i?

722
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,265
To screw with me.

723
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,500
Then i'm gonna say yes.

724
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,600
Wait, wait, stop, stop.
What's that smell?

725
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,700
The bone is smoking.

726
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,600
Her bones are harder
than the drill?

727
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,600
We ran a full-Body
bone scan

728
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,400
To find the cause
of hardening in the hip.

729
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:00,500
No hot spots
anywhere.

730
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,100
Tracer could have been
inactive.

731
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,700
So i screwed up the test?

732
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,465
There are so many ways
that could have happened.

733
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,300
Maybe it was inactive.
Maybe it didn't fully circulate.

734
00:29:07,335 --> 00:29:08,600
It circulated.
The camera picked up-

735
00:29:08,635 --> 00:29:10,700
Hey, hey-
It's christmas.

736
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,200
Why are you guys fighting?

737
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,800
Why do you think
there are no hot spots?

738
00:29:15,835 --> 00:29:16,965
I did not screw up.

739
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,100
The density's consistent.

740
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
It just means the density
was consistent.

741
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
It doesn't mean
it was cold.

742
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,500
It's possible all she has
are hot spots.

743
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,465
It's consistent

744
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,600
Because her entire skeleton
is turning to stone.

745
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,300
Good for an aspiring superhero.

746
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,500
Fatal for a human hoping
to make it to kwanzaa.

747
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,600
It's gotta be from a Carbonic
Anhydrase Type-II deficiency.

748
00:29:38,635 --> 00:29:40,400
It has free will-
It doesn't have to be anything

749
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:42,565
- It doesn't want to be.
- I meant, if it's not CA-2...

750
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,300
Well, none of the other causes
of osteopetrosis are treatable.

751
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,300
You're right.
It's gotta be.

752
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,665
We'll run her blood

753
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,400
And hope that
your sunny optimism

754
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:56,400
Isn't misplaced.

755
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,600
They accused kutner
of screwing up a test

756
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,900
Because they hate him.

757
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,865
You're surprised?

758
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,150
That's the sort of crap
that happens

759
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:11,400
When you mess
with people's heads.

760
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,700
One day he will
screw up a test.

761
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
If they don't accuse him
of that because they like him,

762
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:17,700
Someone could die.

763
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,065
Where are we going?

764
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,600
Nowhere, i just know
it hurts you.

765
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Ca-2 deficiency's
a genetic disorder

766
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:30,165
That scrambles proteins.

767
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,765
If the blood test
is positive,

768
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,200
You'll need
a bone marrow transplant.

769
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,800
Transplant sounds like
a euphemism for slim odds.

770
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,100
Uh, slim but not none.

771
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,200
We're gonna need to test jane
for a match.

772
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,400
Don't you have donor banks?

773
00:30:46,435 --> 00:30:47,665
Jane is your best bet.

774
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,200
The procedure's
perfectly safe.

775
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:50,700
There's no risk.
No risk!

776
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,365
Any surgery has...

777
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,800
Then don't tell me
there's no risk.

778
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,100
You gonna tell me
there's no pain either?

779
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,100
The testing will hurt
a little-

780
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:00,200
I'll be fine.

781
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,500
If she doesn't do this
and you don't make it,

782
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,600
She's gonna spend
the rest of her life

783
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:10,700
Blaming herself.

784
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,200
Mom... please.

785
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,100
Find someone else.

786
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,900
Let someone else
take the risk.

787
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,900
Donor bank turned up
a 49-Year-Old man in cleveland

788
00:31:37,935 --> 00:31:39,900
Who's a five out of six
hla match.

789
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,400
First flight out of cleveland
leaves at-

790
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:43,117
Why is a 49-Year-Old
cleveland man

791
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,765
A closer match
than her daughter?

792
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,000
He may not be.
Maggie didn't let us test her.

793
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,865
- Why not?
- Pain,

794
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,265
Danger, risk of-

795
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,665
The only reason to give
multiple reasons

796
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,600
Is your searching for
what the person wants to hear.

797
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
House.

798
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,565
You were wrong
about sainted mommy.

799
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,500
Don't care.
You can forget the donor bank.

800
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,000
There's no ca-2 deficiency.

801
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,200
Best we can do is
make her comfortable.

802
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,600
Is that from taub?

803
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,100
Yes.

804
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,900
Yes, it is.

805
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,100
Merry christmas.

806
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,000
Who's gonna tell the patient
she's dying?

807
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,400
I will.

808
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,400
And nobody leaves here until
we find out what killed her.

809
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,100
Whatever she has is fatal.

810
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,200
Makes no difference
if it's disease number 58

811
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:53,200
Or 907.

812
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
You guys mad at me?

813
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,100
Nope.
You had no choice.

814
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,165
Of course i had a choice.

815
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,050
You had no choice
once i made my choice.

816
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:04,900
And now i'm choosing
not to be mad at you.

817
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,600
Why?
'Cause it'll drive house nuts.

818
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,700
You think that'll
make your lives better or worse?

819
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,300
I told my mom
i don't care what she thinks.

820
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,000
I want you to test my marrow.

821
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,800
I can't be dying.

822
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,700
Sure, you can.

823
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,700
You're wrong.

824
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,900
You don't even know
what i have.

825
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,900
What you have is
one last christmas

826
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:35,800
With your daughter.

827
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
One last chance
to give her a present-

828
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,500
The truth.

829
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,150
It's inexpensive.

830
00:33:43,185 --> 00:33:44,300
Highly valued.

831
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,400
Never have to stand in line
to return it

832
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:47,717
The day after christmas.

833
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:49,000
What are you talking about?

834
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,765
A mother
who's going to die

835
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,400
Doesn't refuse a donor test
because it might hurt.

836
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,100
She refuses when she knows
it won't match.

837
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,600
Which tends to happen
when mother and daughter

838
00:34:01,635 --> 00:34:03,400
Aren't mother and daughter.

839
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,765
I can do dna tests

840
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,500
If you'd rather
keep lying to me.

841
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,200
I never wanted kids.

842
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,700
I love them,
but with my genes-

843
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,400
I knew this woman.

844
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,400
A drug addict.

845
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,065
She got pregnant,

846
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,000
Didn't want to have
an abortion.

847
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,000
But she also didn't want
her daughter to ever know

848
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,800
Who her real mother was.

849
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,500
What she was.

850
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,900
I promised never to tell.

851
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,900
Then a promise to an addict
is worth more

852
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:56,500
Than a promise
to your daughter?

853
00:34:56,535 --> 00:34:57,900
It'd be cruel to tell her.

854
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,200
Right.

855
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,700
She lives a lie,

856
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,400
You get to die a hypocrite.

857
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,300
Mom, the doctors told me
what's happening.

858
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,200
It's gonna be okay,
sweetheart.

859
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,000
I promise you.

860
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,900
Doctors can be wrong.

861
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,700
There's still a chance
i can beat-

862
00:35:18,735 --> 00:35:20,600
Do you really believe that?

863
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,000
I do.

864
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,400
No, mom, you're dying.

865
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,900
Nobody can help you.

866
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
It's not going to be okay.

867
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,900
That was cold.

868
00:36:03,935 --> 00:36:05,100
Yeah.

869
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,700
What'd you get
for christmas?

870
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,200
I got a watch,
a vintage Ip,

871
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,300
And a second-Edition
Conan Doyle.

872
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,900
And if that wasn't
bad enough,

873
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:37,300
My patient's dying.

874
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,500
Oh, christmas deaths
in a hospital-

875
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:41,200
There's nothing
more depressing.

876
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,200
No one ever wants to go
in the patient's room.

877
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,500
Even the candy stripers
leave them alone.

878
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,500
But i saw something amazing.

879
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,300
Pure truth.

880
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,500
She told her mother
that she was dying.

881
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,900
Stripped her
of all hope.

882
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,100
That sounds...
horrible.

883
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,500
It was like watching some
bizarre astronomical event

884
00:37:04,535 --> 00:37:06,065
That you know you're
never gonna see again.

885
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,600
You tell people the cold,
hard truth all the time.

886
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:09,600
You get off on it.

887
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,500
'Cause i don't care.

888
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,800
She cared.

889
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,000
She did it anyway.

890
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,600
She did it
because she cared.

891
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,400
The Angels of Christmas
have finally given House

892
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:25,000
A present he can appreciate.

893
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:25,965
Well, don't ruin it.

894
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,065
Don't pin this on Christ.

895
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,665
He has got enough nails on him

896
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,400
Patients had to die...

897
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,000
Would you take off
that hat.

898
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,300
It's Christmas.
It's a reindeer.

899
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,900
It's a moose on a jew.

900
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,500
Who cares?

901
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,965
Things have their place.

902
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,900
You wouldn't hang dreidels
from a christmas tree.

903
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,800
You could.

904
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,600
Things don't care.

905
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,300
No, they don't.

906
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,900
Happy Solstice, House.

907
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,900
* God Rest Ye Merry,
Gentlemen *

908
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,400
* Let Nothing You Dismay *

909
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,200
* Remember Christ Our Savior *

910
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:12,700
* Was Born On Christmas Day *

911
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,700
* To Save Us All
From Satan's Power *

912
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:18,000
* When We Were
Gone Astray... *

913
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,400
Don't you people know
holiday spirit?

914
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,365
Bring me the eggnog
of good cheer.

915
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,165
House, if you have
something to say, say it.

916
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,400
If you don't, give us a chance
to get home before Santa.

917
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,600
Scrooge.

918
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,600
Give the patient
risperidone.

919
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,165
That's an anti-Psychotic.

920
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,965
She's dying.
She's not crazy.

921
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,400
I am going to perform
a christmas miracle.

922
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,165
* Oh, Tidings *

923
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,000
* Of Comfort And Joy *

924
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,400
* Comfort And Joy... * *

925
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,200
You said all the other causes
of Osteopetrosis are fatal.

926
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,100
Except for the one we discovered early.

927
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,700
Because it was impossible.

928
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,200
When a fetus forms, it's
just a mass of cells.

929
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,100
Breast tissue covers an
extensive portion of the body.

930
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,500
As the fetus develops,
most of this tissue recedes,

931
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,200
Remaining only
in the fun places.

932
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,965
But sometimes
extra breast tissue

933
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,600
Is left behind in places
where it doesn't belong.

934
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,000
Risperidone does 
a lot of things.

935
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,700
One is it makes 
breast tissue swell,

936
00:39:12,735 --> 00:39:14,100
So we can find it more easily.

937
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,500
You're telling me i could
have breast cancer...

938
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,250
Somewhere not 
in my breasts?

939
00:39:18,285 --> 00:39:19,365
That doesn't make sense.

940
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,900
Taub's parents have a
winter condo in florida,

941
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,850
But they're still
new yorkers.

942
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:25,300
Actually, my parents-
Don't care.

943
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,800
I told a parable.

944
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,400
Now i'm going
to raise the dead.

945
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,600
Give me that syringe.

946
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,100
That's gotta be
a fat deposit.

947
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,700
Yes, i could be wrong.

948
00:39:37,735 --> 00:39:39,200
If i am, she's dead.

949
00:39:39,235 --> 00:39:40,800
So shut up.

950
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,300
What's that?

951
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,500
Risperidone also causes
galactorrhea.

952
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,100
What's that-

953
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,200
Galac-Galactic?

954
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Open your mouth.

955
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,500
Relax, you've had it before.

956
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:00,700
I am not-

957
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,800
Milk? Eww!

958
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,600
We'll cut out your mom's
tumor and start her on Chemo.

959
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,600
All the rest of your
symptoms should go away.

960
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,100
I love you.

961
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,900
I know.

962
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,600
Have a wonderful life.

963
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,400
