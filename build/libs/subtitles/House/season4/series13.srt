1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,437
Whoever thought walking in a circle
at two miles an hour would be draining?

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,270
Fresh air, exercise.

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,402
You know, some things do
have their negative sides.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,571
Our income just got cut in half.

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,206
And we get to spend twice
as much time together.

6
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,683
More, if you don't leave
before your lunch hour is over.

7
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,022
Out of my way.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,752
We have a legal right to
hold you up for 15 seconds.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,225
Fifteen, fourteen...

10
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,318
One.

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,057
Eleven, ten...

12
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:32,787
Ow!

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,927
Just trying to do my job.

14
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,268
Hey, relax. Three more
seconds and you can go.

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,544
Are you telling me what to do?

16
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,407
It's okay.

17
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,144
Just take a breath.

18
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,219
Get the hell off me!

19
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,617
I think it's been 15...

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,250
You okay?

21
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,625
<i>Oh, my God. Jeff?</i>

22
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,459
Standby.

23
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,445
Place is a mess.

24
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,178
Welcome to a world without nurses.
Here, you can start with these.

25
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,685
It's not my fault. I don't use nurses.

26
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,619
Cuddy was looking for you,
said she'd send you down here.

27
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,555
I know. That's why I'm here.

28
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,990
Because Cuddy hasn't found you yet.

29
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:12,122
She's going to look everywhere
except the place she wants me to be.

30
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,537
Hey. I've got an aortic dissection here.

31
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,047
What's with the idiot?

32
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,713
Fainting spell and a
recent history of dysgeusia,

33
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,550
everything tastes like
lemon meringue pie.

34
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,884
You want to take him?

35
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,185
No.

36
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,720
Sir!

37
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,493
Why do you have two
lunches in front of you?

38
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,558
Been here for two meals.

39
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,661
And you're happy with that? No.

40
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,203
I just don't see much
use in complaining.

41
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,031
Seriously?

42
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,272
It's a pretty useful tool.

43
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,005
You complain, make people miserable.

44
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,779
Then they do what you want,
to make the misery go away.

45
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,785
We probably should say something.
Maybe I can call one of doctors...

46
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,014
They're doing their best.

47
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,116
Ow!

48
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,751
What the hell?

49
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,192
I'm sure it was an accident.

50
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,294
Is he Canadian?

51
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,199
He's a low priority.

52
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,295
Is that a yes?

53
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,573
He's just... Happy.

54
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,041
I've got to stop this,
before it spreads.

55
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,304
You guys are done.

56
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,486
Could be a metabolic
disorder, toxic exposure,

57
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,081
carcinoma of the tongue metastasized
to the brain, epilepsy, M.S.

58
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,322
Or it could be the flu and we
should all be back in the E.R.

59
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,125
No, you're ignoring the big symptom.

60
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,635
What if we were looking at both
the flu and decent parenting.

61
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,936
Okay, you two are perfectly healthy.

62
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,232
This guy wasn't pandering.
He wasn't vanilla nice.

63
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,970
He was nice without any
aspiration of personal gain.

64
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,668
I'm thinking genetic defect.

65
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,907
Niceness is a defect?

66
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,778
Three cavemen see a stranger
running towards them with a spear

67
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,949
one fights, one flees, one smiles
and invites him over for fondue.

68
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,115
That last guy didn't last
long enough to procreate.

69
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,094
And how long has the
patient been suffering?

70
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,426
At least as long as his wife
has known him, eleven years.

71
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,989
The chances of him having an
undiagnosed pathology for that long...

72
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,261
What are you saying?

73
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,666
Evolution is wrong?

74
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,229
Where do you think we
are? 21st century America?

75
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,037
He's saying that
statistics are true, too.

76
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,440
The world is a bell curve,

77
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,706
most of us fall within
the standard deviation.

78
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,178
But there are outliers.

79
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,513
And if we believe in the
existence of extreme jerkiness,

80
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,382
which I suspect that we do,

81
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,283
then we also have to accept the
existence of the opposite extreme.

82
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,658
You want it to be a symptom, because
then we're supposed to be jerks,

83
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,197
which means you don't even
have to try to be nice.

84
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,469
Okay, maybe I am biased.
Let's take a vote.

85
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,004
Who thinks niceness is not a symptom?

86
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,531
And who thinks that their vote counts?

87
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,248
You two, check out his home
for toxins. Taub and 31...

88
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,375
31?

89
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,847
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that
either way was good with you.

90
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,323
Taub and Thirteen, MRI for
tumors, EEG for nerve damage

91
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,260
and test whatever comes out
of him for everything else.

92
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,505
Too much axis tilt.

93
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,371
Don't release until your thumb's
at the bottom of the ball.

94
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,441
I assume Wilson was busy.

95
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,076
Again.

96
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,029
No axis tilt.

97
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,296
With Amber?

98
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,898
Again.

99
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,433
Still. It was nice of you
to invite me. This is fun.

100
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,646
No, it wasn't. No, it isn't.

101
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,308
I didn't invite you to
be nice, I invited you

102
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:29,479
because bowling isn't one of the
two things guys do by themselves.

103
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,284
What's the second thing?

104
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,416
Other hand.

105
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,998
Well, if people are incapable of
being nice, why bother having the word?

106
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,465
The ontological proof of niceness.

107
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,766
The existence of the word proves
the existence of the concept.

108
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,831
Look out for those
minotaurs on your drive home.

109
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,972
And I thought motives don't
matter, only results mattered.

110
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,308
So what are you gonna do?

111
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,050
To screw up Wilson's relationship
so you don't have to listen to me

112
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,585
while you bowl.

113
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:05,622
I wish the best for them, and
their tragically deformed children.

114
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,384
She's good at being bad.

115
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,325
You might not be able to destroy her.

116
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,232
As long as I give it my best
shot, I can hold my head high.

117
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,100
Cameron had this one
insufferable friend.

118
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,335
She wasn't going to get rid of her,
and I sure wasn't going to join them.

119
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,468
So I just said, "See her on Thursdays. "

120
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,307
I know it's not as exciting
as an exploding birthday cake,

121
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:32,851
but, hell, I don't want to hang
out with her every night anyway.

122
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,422
That's amazing. Cameron only
has one insufferable friend?

123
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,805
Joint custody.

124
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,442
Of Wilson?

125
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,843
Unless we have another love child.

126
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,638
Deal with him.

127
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,949
He needs a mother figure.

128
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,982
I'm not saying you're not
entitled to spend time with him.

129
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,177
I'm just saying I'm entitled, too.

130
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,285
I don't know how to deal with
him when he's being reasonable.

131
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,657
This is reasonable? This is crazy.

132
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,060
You're not a child, you
can make your own plans.

133
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,190
No. Crazy is what House would
normally do in this situation,

134
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,325
swap your lubricant with super glue.

135
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,460
The man knows me.

136
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:28,132
This is his way of accepting us.

137
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,004
It's actually a very touching moment.

138
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,910
I'm proposing I get every other
day and every other weekend.

139
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,412
I have Yoga Wednesdays,
you can have him then,

140
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,182
but you have to have him home by 11:00.

141
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,819
We can swap weekends.

142
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,987
Mondays and Wednesdays. And midnight.

143
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,860
If he's not home till midnight, we
won't be asleep till almost 2:00.

144
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,957
Wilson, make a ruling.

145
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,192
No.

146
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,206
You two are like dogs circling
each other in the park.

147
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,175
And I say that with all
the love in the world.

148
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,268
You need to sniff each
other's butts, bare your teeth

149
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,210
and arrive at some strange d?tente.

150
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,772
Otherwise you'll end up
biting each other's eyes out.

151
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,512
Again, with all the love in the world.

152
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,681
I'll let you sniff first.

153
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,056
Take my deal or get out of my apartment.

154
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,927
Take my deal or I move in.

155
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,966
This guy worked for Habitat
for Humanity in Costa Rica.

156
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,903
And coaches handicapped kids.

157
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,772
You think we should do a
work up, on the other coaches?

158
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,572
It is possible he's too perfect.

159
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,977
I'm not saying he's perfect,
I'm saying he's trying to be.

160
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,072
It's what people do.

161
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,373
What?

162
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:47,817
That's not what people do.

163
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,414
People usually suck, but they
want to be good, want to be nice.

164
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,151
House?

165
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,216
Exception that proves the rule.

166
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,818
What sort of argument is that?

167
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,158
Bad one.

168
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,202
That might be relevant.

169
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:09,073
Hydrofluoric acid. Lowers his calcium,
causes the fainting and taste issue.

170
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,234
But not the niceness.

171
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,709
Wouldn't that be nice?

172
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,675
You are King Solomon.

173
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,909
If you want us to cut him in
half, we're cool with that.

174
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,886
My boyfriend's too much of a
wuss to make the call for himself.

175
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,481
And I mean that with all
the love in the world.

176
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,959
I'm gonna piss off one of
them. And they both scare me.

177
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,741
"Your treatment of
patients is reprehensible. "

178
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,146
You're reading his performance review?

179
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,810
I'm busy. We have a nurses' strike.

180
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,581
"Your management of
employees borders on abuse. "

181
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,351
Let's go.

182
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,458
No, I... I want to hear it.

183
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,360
"You are overtly contemptuous
of hospital hierarchy. "

184
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,294
And covertly.

185
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,163
But I suppose, you
didn't know about that.

186
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,034
"Your attitude towards supervisory
personnel is disrespectful.

187
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,302
"And a disturbingly large proportion
of your comments are racist or sexist. "

188
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,708
That top makes you look
like an Afghani prostitute.

189
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,147
Would be an example of that.

190
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,705
Sign this.

191
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,047
House, I got the... It can wait.

192
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,314
I will sign if you
will give us a ruling.

193
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:33,324
I will give you a ruling if
you do the reviews on your team.

194
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,196
I'd be happy to continue
the mockery of this process.

195
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,967
What did you offer him?
Wednesdays till 11:00,

196
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,195
and alternate weekends.

197
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,863
Wednesdays till 11:00,
and alternate weekends.

198
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,840
Yes! Wednesday nights are
Ladies' Nights at Cheetah's.

199
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,304
Calcium's normal.

200
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,971
Wow. It really could wait.

201
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,912
Everything's normal. And
you thought it wouldn't be?

202
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,348
He's a carpet cleaner, he's got
a home full of hydrofluoric acid.

203
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,908
Doesn't mean his calcium should be low.

204
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,420
Yeah, actually, it kind of does.
HF causes lower levels of...

205
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,513
Lower, not low. Lower than normal.

206
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,388
Lower than yesterday.
Yesterday might have been high.

207
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,393
What's lower than high?

208
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,895
He actually has hypercalcemia,

209
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,863
which is being lowered
to normal by the HF.

210
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,732
So what gives us elevated
calcium, bad taste and fainting?

211
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,134
I take it you know.

212
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,366
Get the team. This is gonna be fun.

213
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,804
Hello, again.

214
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,576
These people think you're not too nice.

215
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,878
Too nice? For what?

216
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,750
For life as we know it to have evolved
without an intelligent designer.

217
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,051
I'm going to prove them wrong.

218
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,183
Your wife is very ugly.

219
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,228
Get out of here. Deb...

220
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,291
He's obviously trying to prove a point.

221
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,897
I think I just did. You're
either perfect or you're sick.

222
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,869
And in my experience,
sick is much more common.

223
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,736
He's not sick. He's nice.

224
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,935
Nice in the sense that your toaster
is nice for making you breakfast.

225
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,205
It's the only thing his
wiring will let him do.

226
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,077
He has Williams Syndrome.

227
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,709
Your husband is missing the
genes that make him suspicious.

228
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,980
You're wrong, he's...

229
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,782
Relax, there's no cure.

230
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,221
He's gonna go right on
tasting lemon meringue pie,

231
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,555
fainting and being a sap.

232
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,254
What about the other symptoms?

233
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,590
He has no other symptoms.

234
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,788
But Williams does.

235
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,093
He's got the teeth, the glasses...

236
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,062
Williams cuts IQ by 20...

237
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,228
He doesn't work in
the physics department,

238
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,204
except when they spill a
black hole on their carpet.

239
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,104
Elfin appearance?

240
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,802
Yeah, he's more Legolas than Keebler.

241
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,710
Bet you he can still crack
off a batch of Pecan Sandies.

242
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,146
Perfect pitch?

243
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,046
You love to karaoke, right?

244
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,817
I suck. Modest.

245
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,910
Another symptom.

246
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,387
No, he really does suck.

247
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,222
Give us a warble. Know any Cher?

248
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,488
No, but I know Bread.

249
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,531
<i>Baby, I'm-a want you</i>

250
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,365
<i>Baby, I'm-a need you</i>

251
00:13:55,801 --> 00:14:00,670
<i>You're the only one I
care enough to hurt about</i>

252
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,969
<i>Maybe I'm-a...</i>

253
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,906
What's the matter?

254
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,808
He's stroking!

255
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,947
Not a moment too soon.

256
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,433
You were wrong.

257
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:36,874
Why do people say that with such
pleasure? It's very hurtful, you know.

258
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,536
It means the patient gets to keep
being nice. Why does that offend you?

259
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,102
It's the way he said it.

260
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,707
He wasn't relieved, he was
excited. He was also wrong.

261
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,809
And I say that with
no sense of pleasure.

262
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,445
Patient tested negative for Williams,

263
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,455
which means the stroke and
everything else wasn't caused...

264
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,721
You have a friendly demeanor but
you sometimes get too involved.

265
00:14:55,794 --> 00:15:01,699
You relate well to your peers and patients
and you complete tasks in a timely manner.

266
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,758
Please sign.

267
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,097
What the hell was that? I have to give

268
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,468
each of you performance reviews.

269
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,542
Plenty of other conditions can
cause debilitating niceness.

270
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,736
How is that supposed to help him?

271
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,302
I don't know, how was it
supposed to help Wilson?

272
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,746
Cross out Wilson's name and the
date and then fill in your own.

273
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,614
The point of a review is
to give feedback to help...

274
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,550
I'm thinking neurosyphilis.

275
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,556
Wouldn't show up on the
MRI without contrast.

276
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,821
I'll go run the tests.

277
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:39,331
He doesn't think it's syphilis but
he's gonna go run those tests anyway.

278
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,236
Because he doesn't know,
that's why we do tests.

279
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,799
Because he's a wimp.
Because he's afraid of you.

280
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,606
You want me to intimidate
him into not being afraid?

281
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,739
Not sure I know how to do
that. Reviews make a difference.

282
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,507
People have to listen,
so they have to learn...

283
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,849
I don't think the right time to tell the
dog not to pee on the rug is semi-annually.

284
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,786
You don't want to do the paperwork.

285
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,450
I am concerned about the rain forest.

286
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,626
I'll do it.

287
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,993
I know.

288
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,831
I don't have syphilis.

289
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,461
You don't know.

290
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,174
How many ways are there to get it?

291
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,607
You can know who you had sex
with, you can't know who she...

292
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,769
I do.

293
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,278
Not for sure.

294
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:26,842
It's a waste of time. I had a
stroke. You can't keep wasting time.

295
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,283
We were tested for the Peace Corps.

296
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,616
Ten years ago.

297
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,316
You haven't been with your
wife every minute of every day.

298
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,484
You think I'm naive, don't you?

299
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,495
I think you're... Yeah.

300
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,756
I know my wife.

301
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,128
She's not perfect.

302
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,100
I'm not perfect. But she loves me.

303
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:49,974
And she's always loved me.
Every minute, every day.

304
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,818
You're 15 minutes late.

305
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,896
Have you heard the good news?

306
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,397
Miley Cyrus is playing a
third night at the Spectrum?

307
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,527
Happiness is possible. And not just in
this life but in the next. Where you can...

308
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,698
Oh, you're selling religion! I'm
sorry, I bought some Islam yesterday.

309
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,574
Well, it's where your light
showed signs before mending...

310
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,144
Have a good evening.

311
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,812
You're late. Fifteen minutes.

312
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,247
Sixteen minutes. My sixteen minutes.

313
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,841
So keep him an extra sixteen minutes.

314
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,546
You hear that? She doesn't care.

315
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,589
You're going mini-golfing, what's
it matter? You've got a tee-off time?

316
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,090
It matters because you don't
get to decide what matters.

317
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,821
It was my fault. I had to take a shower.

318
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,592
Which was my fault.

319
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,926
I have to take a dump.

320
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:51,696
Anything else I don't need
to know before you leave?

321
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,606
Have fun on your play date.
You've got mommy's numbers, right?

322
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,671
Daddy needs a drink.

323
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,120
I was thinking, if we
discount the niceness issue...

324
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,485
Sit down.

325
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,420
I think it's a heart
defect. Nothing on the echo.

326
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,398
Could be a patent foramen ovale.
Explains the stroke and the syncope

327
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,959
and a PFO wouldn't show
up on a routine echo.

328
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,230
I'm going to do a bubble test.

329
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,068
You got a minute, first?

330
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,701
Sure.

331
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,046
I think you've shown remarkable
strength in a difficult situation.

332
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,674
Are you giving me a performance review?

333
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:38,841
A good one.

334
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,909
I'm gonna do a bubble test.

335
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,353
There was enough blood left over from
his admission work up to run the VDRL.

336
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,652
You doubted your patient?

337
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,888
No, what I thought didn't matter.

338
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,590
House said he wouldn't let us go
on until we ruled out neurosyphilis.

339
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,893
It's not neurosyphilis, it's a PFO.

340
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,528
It's neurosyphilis.
The tests were positive.

341
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,537
It's always the same conversation.
They tell you you must be mistaken,

342
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:13,210
which is why I always run the tests
twice. Then they blame the other guy.

343
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,516
Which makes sense if they're innocent.
But, obviously, half of them aren't.

344
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,853
They don't seem to get that they're
busted. Scientifically proven.

345
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,722
Unless your spouse cheated, too.

346
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,591
Exactly. That's what you're praying for
in that moment, that she cheated, too.

347
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,687
And then, if she doesn't kill
you, you know that she did.

348
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,289
You'd know she betrayed you.

349
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,961
And then you realize
that that sucks worse.

350
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,935
The test must be wrong.

351
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,138
I ran it twice.

352
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,546
Not that test. The one
I took 10 years ago.

353
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,951
What other explanation is there?

354
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,128
He really sees no other possibility.

355
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,132
Did you have an affair?

356
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,223
No.

357
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,997
Then why aren't you angry with him?

358
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,672
You ever know anybody
who's just too nice?

359
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,745
No. It's annoying.

360
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:18,008
Then you realize it's annoying because
they remind you of what you're not,

361
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,983
that you'll never be
as good as they are.

362
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,681
And then you think, why can't I?

363
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,486
And before you know it,

364
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,460
that naive idiot you laughed at

365
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,698
has made you a better person.

366
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:42,371
You really think I've been in love
all these years with a symptom?

367
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,102
If syphilis caused lesions in his brain,

368
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,941
and the lesions caused
personality changes...

369
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,779
You may notice a change in
him, as his condition improves.

370
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,150
I know my husband. He's
not going to change.

371
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,254
You should get yourself tested.

372
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,353
So much for the bell curve.

373
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,795
How can House be an ass
without it being an illness,

374
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,992
but niceness is a biological crime?

375
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,759
You got five bucks?

376
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,360
Yeah...

377
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:18,769
Niceness just cost you five bucks,
being an ass generally turns a profit.

378
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,838
Kutner, could you excuse us?
I need to do Taub's review.

379
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,677
You can stay.

380
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,450
I think it'd be better if
this was done privately.

381
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,043
This isn't going to be done.

382
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,019
What is with you guys? I've
given you advice before.

383
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,385
Not as our boss.

384
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,550
What's the difference? Advice is advice.

385
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,353
Fair enough. I'll go first.

386
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,064
"You demonstrate a great air of confidence,
which is really pissing me off. "

387
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,896
House authorized me to...
How long have you known him?

388
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,027
He's using you. I volunteered
because I knew he wouldn't...

389
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,073
He could care less about the paperwork.
He's using you to screw with you.

390
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,539
He knows it'll annoy us,
we'll stand up to you,

391
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,871
which will force you to
confront the fact that

392
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,377
even though you think
you're our superior,

393
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,639
you're no different from us.

394
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,013
He gave you authority,
to keep you in your place.

395
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,812
It's true.

396
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,411
Thanks.

397
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,614
Not him. What did he say?

398
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,055
Nothing. What's true?

399
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,716
If there's something
wrong with this guy,

400
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,092
it means there's
something wrong with House.

401
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,064
Are you trying to get me drunk?

402
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,865
What time is it?

403
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,773
10:30.

404
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,002
She'll kill you.

405
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,445
I'll get you home before lights out.

406
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:34,986
Great, then she'll kill me.
If I get any more drunk...

407
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,414
It might not work.

408
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,557
If you know what I mean.

409
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,562
Really?

410
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:49,564
You'd think one or more of your
ex-wives would have mentioned that to me.

411
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,068
They told you? Wait.

412
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,731
Why do you want to get Amber angry?

413
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,171
Because I'm your friend.

414
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,208
No, no, no, you said you approved.

415
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,176
You said you were taking the high road.

416
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,939
For how long, the first exit?

417
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:06,279
Hello, and thank you from saving
me from being righteous to death.

418
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,682
<i>Patient's vomiting blood.</i>

419
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,844
Hematemesis could indicate...

420
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,979
<i>Don't put it on the board.</i>

421
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,113
You don't think it's a symptom?

422
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,181
I think it's my marker.

423
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,055
<i>He has syph and what?</i>

424
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,528
And syph. It can cause hematemesis.

425
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,292
<i>Not everyone agrees.</i>

426
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,856
How could you...

427
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,833
<i>Because if you all
thought it was just syph</i>

428
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,268
you wouldn't have woken me
up in the middle of the night.

429
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,000
If it was just syph, he
wouldn't be getting worse.

430
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,199
<i>He's already on penicillin.</i>

431
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,866
The bleeding's probably
from liver damage,

432
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:35,674
probably caused by ethanol in
the cleansers or the penicillin.

433
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,545
Two more probablies than I like to hear.

434
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,175
Liver test and serologies,
are going to take a full day.

435
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,743
Full night, actually.

436
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,412
<i>Guy might not make it to brunch.</i>

437
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,892
Yes, I knew about your
issue with alcohol.

438
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,226
Yes, I intentionally got you drunk

439
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,094
to provoke an argument,
between you and Amber.

440
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,862
And why I'd do such a thing
is an interesting question.

441
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,598
But what's more interesting is
that you knew as much as I did,

442
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:05,199
and you're the one who's
pouring down the drinks. Why?

443
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,837
Because I thought I was out
having fun with a friend.

444
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,349
I didn't know these drinks had subtext.

445
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,442
I gotta get home.

446
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,182
GGT's normal, that rules out alcohol.

447
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,589
What about serum protein?

448
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,752
It's positive.

449
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,859
Kind of assumed he had protein.

450
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,955
It's how much protein he
has that we care about.

451
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,896
He's positive for syphilis.

452
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,731
Do you mind if I give
you a performance review?

453
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:36,797
Not the patient. House. He has syphilis.

454
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:45,773
<i>What happened?</i>

455
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:50,454
<i>Every time I searched
my soul, I found Anna.</i>

456
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,983
<i>Are you going to tell Marie?</i>

457
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,715
<i>I have to.</i>

458
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,283
<i>It will destroy her!</i>

459
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,853
<i>Will it be any worse...</i>

460
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,664
Yes?

461
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,928
You might want to turn the off TV.

462
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:09,440
I'm multitasking. Also
doing my taxes. And Cuddy.

463
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,770
What did you find out?

464
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,833
Patient has hepatitis.

465
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,845
I assume from your omission of
the word "viral" before the "hep"

466
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,006
that it's not another STD.

467
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,017
Put him on steroids and test him
for sarcoid before the liver failure

468
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,679
becomes liver failed.

469
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,949
We're all doing this.

470
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,392
There's more?

471
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,625
You have syphilis.

472
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,154
<i>Love lasts forever.</i>

473
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,199
No, I don't.

474
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,036
One of us found a vial of your
blood in the lab from when we...

475
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,700
Which one of you?

476
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,403
It's treatable.

477
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,707
We filled a prescription.

478
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,216
You okay?

479
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,713
So, this is why he is who he is.

480
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,008
We don't know.

481
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,815
We know. It's not just a coincidence.

482
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,446
Wilson says he's always been a jerk.

483
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:32,615
But he got worse.

484
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:33,780
After his leg.

485
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,553
The leg was a coincidence.

486
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,251
Did you sleep with him?

487
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,762
So what's going to happen?
What's gonna change?

488
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,031
Maybe he'll be less of a jerk.

489
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,629
Or less of a doctor.

490
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,264
You gotta be a jerk to be a good doctor?

491
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,037
I don't know. Maybe House does.

492
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,542
Why aren't you answering me?

493
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,137
Because it's none of their business.

494
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,081
It's none of your business.

495
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,551
I think the STD makes it my business.

496
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,147
Humans are complicated.

497
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,453
Humans are simple.

498
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,460
A million different
things make us who we are.

499
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,462
You change one, you change everything.

500
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,159
If Mozart was better adjusted,

501
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,397
<i>decides to play catch one day,
maybe there's no Magic Flute.</i>

502
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,301
You did, didn't you?

503
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,906
Something I need to tell you.

504
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,986
You returned him drunk.

505
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,180
On time. Drunk.

506
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,484
On time. No tag backs.

507
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,822
The purpose of the time
was to give me time.

508
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,156
So you didn't have sex...

509
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,356
I like sex. You can have it tonight.

510
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,898
<i>The L Word is on.</i>

511
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,729
You don't get to decide what matters.

512
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,835
Either you're genuinely afraid
I'm gonna make him miserable,

513
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:59,036
or you're afraid I'm gonna make him
happy, or you simply can't stop screwing

514
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,511
with anything that moves. It doesn't
really matter because, whatever the reason,

515
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,916
you'll only get worse. Until
either I stop seeing Wilson

516
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,552
or I stop you.

517
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,889
What do you think I'm going to choose?

518
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,088
If you terminate the agreement, that's
not gonna bring peace to the Mideast.

519
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,291
I'm not terminating the agreement.

520
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,163
I'm amending the agreement.

521
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,062
I'm adding penalty clauses.

522
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:30,767
Fine. Whoever violates it
gets their finger cut off.

523
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,503
I'm serious. So am I.

524
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,804
You want people to drive safer,

525
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,904
take out the airbags and attach
a machete pointing at their neck.

526
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,347
No one will drive over
three miles per hour.

527
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,850
I'm not cutting... We'll figure it out.

528
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,510
On your time.

529
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:58,325
You know she's certifiable,
right? I got forms in my desk.

530
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,600
Where is she wrong?

531
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,338
What were you going to tell me?

532
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,974
Nothing.

533
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,309
You're punishing me?

534
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:13,975
I needed to tell you
something privately.

535
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,644
I'm not gonna tell her.

536
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,848
You'll tell her. She's your
girlfriend. You should tell her.

537
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,515
You're my friend.

538
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,616
It's not the same.

539
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,959
Don't sulk.

540
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,696
Where am I wrong?

541
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,668
"Your management style
is counterproductive.

542
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,208
"You gave me authority over the
team just so they could undercut... "

543
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,268
Critiquing the clap-addled?

544
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,778
Sort of tasteless.

545
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,611
I don't feel like waiting
until your genitals cleared up.

546
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,049
You need to formalize my
authority over the team.

547
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,245
No, I don't.

548
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,117
You don't think I'm qualified?

549
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,019
Compared to those three?

550
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,854
You want to punish Cuddy
for hiring me without...

551
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,757
I like Cuddy.

552
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,761
Parts of her.

553
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,626
You want to crush the
team, by crushing me?

554
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,893
I want to empower them.

555
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,629
Those three idiots need to respect you.

556
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,901
They should respect you.
They should be afraid of you.

557
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,566
So I have to humiliate you.

558
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,611
See, if the team fears you,
they won't question you,

559
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,372
if they don't question you,
they won't get any answers,

560
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,641
if they don't get any
answers, they're useless.

561
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,216
Mocking me saves lives?

562
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,775
Hospital will probably
build you a statue one day.

563
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,279
You know, with a "kick me" sign on the back.

564
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,981
So when you think about
it, the more I mock you,

565
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,785
the more it shows that
I have respect for you.

566
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,487
Or you made up that B.S.
Because you like humiliating me.

567
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,087
Wouldn't rule that out completely.

568
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,291
You busy?

569
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,663
Almost done.

570
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:43,298
So just remember, the rabbit goes
around the tree and jumps down the hole.

571
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,943
Negative for sarcoidosis.

572
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,178
Run him for everything you can think of.

573
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:55,876
Lepto, schisto, hemo and the fourth
Marx Brother nobody ever heard of.

574
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,286
You bitch!

575
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,460
I just went to get us some
lunch. You were asleep.

576
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,190
You moved my book!

577
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,963
Jeff, calm down, it's just the drugs.

578
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,764
The drugs didn't move my...

579
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,465
Jeff?

580
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,533
My husband's having a heart attack!
Can somebody help me, please?

581
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,405
Somebody help me, please!

582
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,186
She saved his life.

583
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:39,356
Or she scabbed. Depends
on your point of view.

584
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,833
So, what do we think? New
symptom? Or just a wife beater?

585
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:45,992
Hey.

586
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,738
Time for you took this baby for a spin.

587
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:57,047
We loaded him full of prednisone
to try to fix the liver.

588
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,278
Good news is, he's running
out of organs to fail.

589
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:04,445
Prednisone could cause roid rage,
which could cause hypertension,

590
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,579
which results...

591
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,352
Roid rage after six hours?

592
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,586
That rate, by sundown,
he'll have eaten most of us.

593
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:16,189
Still could be the
penicillin, allergic reaction.

594
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,529
How does a fried liver
put him into a rage?

595
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,127
It's not frying his liver,
it's frying his syphilis.

596
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,798
The penicillin's working.
The real patient's emerging.

597
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:26,604
So syphilis prevents domestic violence.

598
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,941
I'm gonna be even more
attractive to the ladies.

599
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,447
I was about to test for a
heart issue before the syphilis.

600
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:32,880
PFO could explain the heart attack,

601
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,819
and reduced blood flow to the
brain could explain the rage.

602
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,651
Well, they're all good ideas.

603
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,156
Okay. Let's take a vote.

604
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,853
How many think it's the roids talking?

605
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,960
And who's for the penicillin?

606
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:50,262
And how about whatever she said?

607
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,969
Someone hasn't raised their hand.

608
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,867
Whatever I decide?

609
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,440
You're setting me up.

610
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,707
Why would I do that?

611
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,009
PFO.

612
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,354
PFOs have it.

613
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:16,719
I just hope the bubble test is
positive. Or it's no more Mr. Nice Guy.

614
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:31,301
We gave van Gogh chelation therapy.
Turned him into a house painter.

615
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:36,041
Maybe not. Maybe we just
put Hitler on Ritalin.

616
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,382
Are you comparing House to Hitler?

617
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,507
Oh, God.

618
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:43,081
Just because I don't think he's
Hitler doesn't mean I slept with him.

619
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,315
I don't sleep with everyone
who's better than Hitler.

620
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:50,225
Maybe Taub's right. Maybe this is good.

621
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,522
This is not good.

622
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:56,329
He respected our opinions, he mocked
himself, he was civil, he shared.

623
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:57,898
He didn't care.

624
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,061
He never cares.

625
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,695
He didn't vote. He always
cared about one thing,

626
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,298
solving the puzzle.

627
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,072
But he was irrelevant in that
diagnosis, he had no opinion of his own.

628
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,547
He now cares about nothing.

629
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:16,109
You had no choice, you had to
treat him. What's done is done.

630
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,763
You know that thing I was going
to tell you? I gotta tell you.

631
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:33,103
I got to tell someone. You
have to swear not to tell C.B.

632
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,171
Whatever. That's not
swearing, that's shrugging.

633
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,208
It's actually the opposite of swearing.

634
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,800
I won't tell Amber.

635
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,284
My team thinks that I have syphilis.

636
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,684
Do you? Not yet.

637
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,117
Why do they think you do?

638
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,786
Because I knew they had
access to an old blood sample.

639
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,988
I knew they'd test it
sometime for something.

640
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,588
Why would you swap your blood?
What are you afraid they'd find?

641
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:05,830
Shut up, you're missing the point.
Now they think that I'm on penicillin.

642
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:10,205
Is this some clever practical
joke that I'm not aware of?

643
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:13,641
And as I get better, I get nicer.

644
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,315
That's brilliant.

645
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,114
Foreman thinks I actually
value his opinion.

646
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:26,554
Thank God he said PFO or I'd
have had to do some dancing.

647
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,022
You got time for bowling?

648
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,058
Come on, it's work hours.

649
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,325
I'll get my shoes.

650
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,961
So we don't need to talk about... No.

651
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,664
You're gonna keep screwing... Yeah.

652
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,200
And you're gonna keep talking
about it. We are who we are.

653
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,134
I'll get my shoes.

654
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,650
Okay, got a good view of the heart.

655
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:59,721
What if we lower House's
dosage? Maybe stabilize him?

656
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,054
He doesn't get worse,
he doesn't get better.

657
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:05,254
Quite the line to walk. If we're
wrong, he dies of neurosyphilis.

658
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,058
If we don't, other people die.

659
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,122
Other people who aren't our boss.

660
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,427
People.

661
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:13,433
This sucks. The guy
had a gift. I killed...

662
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:16,730
Hi. What...

663
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,172
House doesn't have syphilis.

664
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,937
He switched the blood samples.

665
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:21,967
How do you know that?

666
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:23,172
House told Wilson.

667
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,943
I wanted to ruin House's day. See you.

668
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,916
We're idiots. We're not idiots.

669
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,750
Positive blood test
means positive blood test.

670
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,289
Apparently not.

671
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,116
There they are. Let's see if they...

672
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,320
What are you doing? We're not done.

673
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,125
He doesn't have syphilis.

674
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,789
I know.

675
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,475
Patient tested positive
for syphilis, right?

676
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,605
Is this some sort of recap?

677
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,442
But why did he test
positive for syphilis?

678
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,914
Oh, oh, I know this.

679
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,918
Either, one, he has syphilis.

680
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,143
I was gonna say that.

681
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,382
Or two, the test was wrong twice.

682
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,789
Or three, he gave us
someone else's blood.

683
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,393
Who? Amber.

684
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:23,669
Get that idiotic smile out of my
face, I got to go on a killing spree.

685
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,742
Or four, he has something that
tests positive for syphilis.

686
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,814
It's not Chagas. He
worked in Costa Rica,

687
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,143
before he was married.

688
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,775
Is two a spree or do
I have to kill you too?

689
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,847
Chagas wouldn't explain the niceness.

690
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:41,357
I've heard of remote tribes that
actually practice acts of kindness.

691
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,950
Or the Chagas caused encephalitis.

692
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,359
The MRI showed no signs...

693
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,954
Until we started him on steroids,
compromised the immune system

694
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,624
and let the infection flare up.

695
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,329
I did another one. It's not much.

696
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,830
It's plenty.

697
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,008
You figured this out because
I don't have syphilis?

698
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,639
Damn.

699
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,717
It should have been my epiphany.

700
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,156
Good news and bad news.

701
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,829
Good news is, we know what you have,

702
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:22,696
it's treatable, and
you're going to live.

703
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,064
Really?

704
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,227
What's the bad news?

705
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,637
The cure is a grueling course of pills.

706
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,004
It's like

707
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,340
one a day for a month.

708
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,471
Now you're just trying to make me laugh.

709
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,538
Yeah, like that's a challenge.

710
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,243
You have Chagas disease.

711
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,377
It's a parasite. It's been
asymptomatic for 10 years.

712
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,547
Not quite. Your brain's been
swollen, not enough to see,

713
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,284
but enough to alter your personality.

714
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,485
We're back to that?

715
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,926
He screamed at you, you
don't think he can change?

716
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,725
That was because of the drugs.

717
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,194
So you think drugs are more
powerful than parasites?

718
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,067
I mean, the ones we're gonna give you
to treat the parasites obviously are,

719
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,573
but I stand by the principle.

720
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,511
I'm not worried.

721
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:13,607
Neither am I.

722
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:19,046
Neither am I. But that's
because I don't care.

723
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:35,997
Reviews?

724
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,667
It was brought to my
attention that, on occasion,

725
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,073
I am not respectful
of hospital hierarchy.

726
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,272
The word was "contemptuous. "

727
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,582
Well phrased, thoughtful...

728
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,992
Identically phrased.
These are all the same.

729
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:03,430
Because underneath it
all, we are all the same.

730
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,959
And Foreman refused to type his up.

731
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,334
Well, it's more than I expected.

732
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,108
There's an extra one in there.

733
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,184
"Your treatment of
patients is nonexistent

734
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:27,985
"because you're not a doctor,
you're an administrator. "

735
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,458
Foreman convinced me that
these could be helpful.

736
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,496
"Your management of employees is,

737
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:36,021
well, let's face it, they're
outside carrying signs. "

738
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,700
The strike ended. The nurses have
been back for two shifts already.

739
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:43,137
You'd think I'd have noticed. What
exactly did they do around here?

740
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:53,412
"You act like employees should fear and
respect you, but your eyes tell us...

741
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,418
"Actually your eyes tell us nothing,
because we're looking at your boobs,

742
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,511
"which tell us that you're
desperate to have someone jump on you

743
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:02,252
"and tell you they love you
one grunted syllable at a time.

744
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,760
"What you want, you run away from.
What you need, you don't have a clue.

745
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:10,265
"What you've accomplished
makes you proud.

746
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,335
"But you're still miserable. "

747
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,163
Please sign.

748
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:22,574
I got a call from Amber today. Says
there's been a violation your contract.

749
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,511
You've been seeing Wilson on her time.

750
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:30,520
She breached confidentiality. You
can let it slide, Officer, we're even.

751
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,785
Yes, you are. You're
both losing fingers.

752
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:38,693
Look what I found.

753
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:39,786
Nice.

754
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,729
They think you might be
able to come home tomorrow.

755
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,600
Yeah? That's good.

756
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,036
What's the matter?

757
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:55,408
The ketchup. There's
something wrong with that.

758
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,147
Tastes fine. Is there anything else?

759
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,811
Everything else is great.

760
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:08,324
I just, I don't know, I guess
I don't like ketchup anymore.

761
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,688
Wonder what else I don't like.

762
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,378
Roll over.

763
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,781
We need a tougher punishment.

764
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,686
You want to come over to the poopy side?

765
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,955
So where are you two going Friday night?

766
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,085
Dinner at L'Auberge.

767
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,926
You're lying.

768
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,194
Of course I am.
