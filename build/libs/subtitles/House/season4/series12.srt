1
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,600
I don't know about you,

2
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:21,900
But i'm nervous.

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,800
Zel tov!

4
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:35,300
Mazel tov!

5
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,250
Mazel tov!
Many children.

6
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:50,600
This is a great thing,
Roz.

7
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,267
I am so happy for you.

8
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,865
Thank you, Mrs. Silver.

9
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,400
Yonatan is a good man
from a good family.

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
I know you chose well
for me.

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,100
I've been blessed.

15
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Cross-Species mating.

16
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,750
If you like darwin
and the galapagos.

17
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:54,600
Amber and i
have a lot in common.

18
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:56,300
She's a cutthroat bitch.

19
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,965
<i>You cry over dark victory.</i>

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,300
Bette davis, another strong,
assertive woman.

21
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:02,600
You don't like strong.
You don't like assertive.

22
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:03,800
You like needy.

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,300
She's not dying, is she?

24
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,300
Yes. Go away.

25
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
I give it two months.

26
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Hundred bucks.

27
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,100
Not really fair.

28
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,600
You're not objective.

29
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,400
But i'm all about
the teaching-

30
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:24,800
We're at four months.

31
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
You hid this from me?

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,065
I was wrong, okay?

33
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,565
I thought you'd be upset.

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,900
I thought you'd track me
down in hallways-

35
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:36,200
<i>I shouldn't have
discounted the sex.</i>

36
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:37,365
<i>She's obviously limber enough</i>

37
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,500
To put off the meltdown
for two months.

38
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:41,600
She's not needy.
I don't need needy.

39
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:42,565
She's scary.

40
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,050
Why does scary need pathetic?

41
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:45,500
Are you gonna talk
to her?

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't see
that i have any choice.

43
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,400
You all right with that?

44
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
<i>No impulse
to save her from me?</i>

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,450
I've broken
the pattern, house.

46
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,842
Which is why
this has a chance.

47
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:58,165
<i>I know
you're too suspicious</i>

48
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,865
To accept that
without getting out your ruler,

49
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,800
And your calipers, and
your scanning equipment, so...

50
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,300
Go ahead.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,300
Get it out of
your system.

52
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
38-Year-Old female
with loss of bladder control,

53
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:17,500
<i>Blood in her urine,
and a broken leg</i>

54
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:19,100
From collapsing
at her wedding.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Ampicillin for the uti.
Shiny cast for the leg.

56
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:25,300
You guys know
wilson's dating amber?

57
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,865
No.

58
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,100
Wilson and amber?

59
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:28,900
I knew.

60
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I asked her out.

61
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,700
Said she'd just
started seeing someone.

62
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:34,367
<i>Cultures were negative
for utis.</i>

63
00:04:34,402 --> 00:04:35,965
No signs of previous
trauma or stds.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,700
- Kidney cancer.
- CT was clean for tumors and kidney stones.

65
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:40,100
I thought Amber
scared you guys.

66
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:40,765
She does.

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,700
But she also has legs that go
all the way up to canada.

68
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:44,865
So do canadians-Doesn't mean
i wanna date one.

69
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,500
Her sodium's low-Could be
endometriosis in the bladder.

70
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:49,367
Low sodium
could also be from low food.

71
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:51,165
Hasidic jews
fast on their wedding day.

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Or sodium was absorbed by
a toxin already in her system.

73
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,165
Was it just the legs,

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,700
Or did you detect something
resembling a soul?

75
00:04:58,735 --> 00:04:59,900
She grew on me.

76
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,700
If there's a toxin in her,
could be carbolic acid.

77
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,200
I'm talking
about the patient now.

78
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:05,265
That much carbolic acid,

79
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,765
Someone would have had
to poison her.

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,500
Could have been a cossack-
If this was 18th century poland

81
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:11,865
And cossacks were
into household cleansers.

82
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,700
Which is why it's more likely
that the poisoner was poisonee.

83
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,065
Suicide's a sin.

84
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,700
Corollary of "people lie"
is "people sin. "

85
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,000
And in my world,
people includes jews.

86
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:22,117
She was getting married.

87
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:23,165
Hasidic women marry young

88
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
So they can start pushing out
little hasidilings.

89
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,465
38 means a woman
not on anyone's hot list

90
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,000
Being pushed onto a guy
who's not on anyone's hot list.

91
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:31,967
No way out, no way out.

92
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:32,865
Endometriosis fits better

93
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,565
Than an epiphany
that her life is meaningless.

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,100
We should start her on a. I.S
and do a cystoscopy to confirm.

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,900
Fine, check her innards
for bad cells

96
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:42,600
And her home for bad karma.

97
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,365
Carbolic acid
should be on the shelf

98
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,300
Right next to the regret
and the self-Loathing.

99
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,965
These people are crazy.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Yeah. She should
be self-Hating.

101
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:51,665
I'm not self-Hating.

102
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,500
I hate religious people who are
out of touch with reality.

103
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:56,300
You only marry someone
you met three times

104
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:58,300
If they're carrying
a little mistake.

105
00:05:58,335 --> 00:05:59,717
What's their divorce rate?

106
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:01,276
<i>Cleaners are all organic.</i>

107
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:02,800
Nothing with carbolic acid.

108
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,465
You like
how they hook up?

109
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,900
Romance is just
emotional foreplay.

110
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,165
Candlelight meals,
flowers.

111
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,400
It's as much a ritual
as anything these people do.

112
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:13,700
<i>Why not go with someone
who's pre-Vetted,</i>

113
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:14,717
Shares the same values?

114
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:15,665
<i>Cut to the quick.</i>

115
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,665
<i>Values may give you
the big picture,</i>

116
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,500
<i>But time together
gives you the little picture-</i>

117
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:22,265
<i>Does she chew her food
too loud?</i>

118
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,200
<i>Will she leave you alone
during the final four?</i>

119
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:25,417
You commit
to something deeper,

120
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,565
You let the little
surprises slide.

121
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Surprises kill-
Which is why i only commit

122
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,165
When there are
no more surprises.

123
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
And you have no more surprises
for your wife.

124
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Do you think this came up
on date number two?

125
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,500
You ever heard
of a hasidic jew into hard rock?

126
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,100
She's listed as a producer
on all of these.

127
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,500
Where there's rock and roll,

128
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,100
And sex...

129
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
Usually, there's drugs.

130
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,900
<i>I'm baal teshuvah.</i>

131
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,700
I became hasidic
about six months ago.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
And before six months ago?

133
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,600
Music business isn't
exactly known for its holiness.

134
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,000
Heroin.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,700
But i've been clean
for months.

136
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,000
Yonatan knows.

137
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,500
The broad strokes.

138
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,900
He never actually asks
the details.

139
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Says what's important
is the person that i am now,

140
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:24,800
Not the person i was then.

141
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,200
How do you go
all the way from-

142
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:28,500
Just took a class.

143
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,200
Then i took another class.

144
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,000
And you just completely left
the music business?

145
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,000
Pop music is considered
frivolous.

146
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,700
Same reason we don't watch tv
or go to movies.

147
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,600
Your drug use may have caused
some long term damage.

148
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,900
<i>We're gonna need
to take a hair sample</i>

149
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:47,765
To test for latent toxins.

150
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,700
<i>So you can never watch
star wars again.</i>

151
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
You figured
that i'll hire you

152
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
If you promise
to dump wilson.

153
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,200
- How did you-
- Wilson had a key.

154
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,900
<i>You figure that i'll make
your life hell at first,</i>

155
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,400
But i'll eventually see
how good you are and keep you.

156
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,500
It's a good plan,
don't you think?

157
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,900
Perfectly tailored
to your personality.

158
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
No, it's not.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,200
You know it's not.

160
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
<i>Means you just wanna stay
in my orbit.</i>

161
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,100
'Cause you figure
i'll eventually realize

162
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:37,065
That i made a mistake

163
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,000
And you're gonna be able
to rub my face in it.

164
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,200
I can't wait.
It's gonna be awesome.

165
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,900
No, it's not.
And you know it's not.

166
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,700
<i>'Cause you know that even
if i made a mistake,</i>

167
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,500
<i>I'd never admit
that i made a mistake.</i>

168
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,100
Which means that you're
just toying with wilson

169
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,900
To toy with me.

170
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,800
Your goal
is pure feral vengeance.

171
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,200
Innocent bystander,

172
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,500
But there's
a greater good.

173
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,400
No, that's not it.

174
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,800
Because a bag
of flaming poop

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,700
Bypasses the bystander.

176
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,300
So...

177
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,800
Which is it, house?

178
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,600
Am i in this for you...

179
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,000
Or am i in this for him?

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,700
Give him back
his sweatshirt.

181
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,400
Pit stains
don't become you.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,900
Treatment had no effect.

183
00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:42,765
Rules out endometriosis.

184
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
And her hair sample
was negative

185
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:45,165
For residue drugs.

186
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,400
This woman lived
in the fast lane

187
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:47,165
Till six months ago.

188
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Maybe we're missing
something.

189
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:49,065
She admitted drug use.

190
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,600
Doubt she's holding out on her
days as an asbestos miner.

191
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:53,900
Cryoglobulinemia might account
for the symptoms.

192
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,400
Except for
the one you missed.

193
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,500
There's no change
in her condition.

194
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,765
I'm not talking
about a new symptom.

195
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm talking about one
that presented six months ago.

196
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:02,900
Look, she's nuts,
but we can't just give her

197
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,065
10 ccs of atheism
and send her home.

198
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Religion is a symptom
of irrational belief

199
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
And groundless hope.

200
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
Altered mental status,
on the other hand,

201
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:14,965
Is a symptom of porphyria.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,900
She didn't develop
uncontrollable anger,

203
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:18,065
Crying, anxiety.

204
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,665
She just decided
to go to temple.

205
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,500
<i>The woman didn't just
choose to keep kosher.</i>

206
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
She went directly
to the extremes of hasidism,

207
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,750
A life of stringent rules.

208
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:28,065
She became a masochist.

209
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,000
She didn't like her old life,
so she changed it.

210
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:32,000
People don't change.

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,800
They want to.
They need to.

212
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,100
Taub gave up a six figure
plastic surgery career

213
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:37,465
For this job.

214
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,900
That mean he has
porphyria?

215
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,000
He switched jobs
to save his marriage.

216
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,200
He did it to avoid change.

217
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,365
He's right.

218
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,950
<i>You don't suddenly
choose crazy</i>

219
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,465
Without suddenly
being crazy.

220
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,200
No, no, if she walked
away from everything

221
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,817
To go base jumping
or live with apes,

222
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,476
We wouldn't be having
this discussion.

223
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:56,100
We would if she was
also tinkling blood

224
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:58,000
Out of her overexcited bladder.

225
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,900
Pump hadassah full of hematin
and give her a phlebotomy.

226
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,700
Bloodletting?

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,065
<i>Porphyria is a rare
genetic disorder</i>

228
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,500
That causes an overproduction
of a certain protein.

229
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,565
Draining the blood
relieves-

230
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,700
The hair test
for damage from drugs

231
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,100
Showed she has
a rare genetic disease?

232
00:11:19,135 --> 00:11:19,865
Not-Not exactly.

233
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,600
We're testing her now
to confirm.

234
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,700
You're treating it
before you confirm it?

235
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,700
<i>Blood test results
take 24 hours.</i>

236
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,800
You must have seen something
that makes you suspect it.

237
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,100
Dr. House has

238
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:32,000
A theory.

239
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,300
A theory based on what?

240
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,900
We'd like
a different doctor.

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,750
I assure you
that dr. House is our best-

242
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:41,465
Then we will settle
for second-Best,

243
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,400
Someone who doesn't think
my wife is sick

244
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:44,500
Just because
she's religious.

245
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:45,900
<i>If you prefer,</i>

246
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
I can give your wife
my second-Best diagnosis.

247
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
Do you know wilson's
dating amber?

248
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:54,500
I have reviewed
the chart.

249
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,950
Someone on your team
must have pointed out

250
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:00,600
That cryoglobulinemia
also fits the symptoms.

251
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:03,000
<i>Yes, it fits many
of the symptoms.</i>

252
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:05,000
<i>My wife's body is sick.</i>

253
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,900
Her mind and soul are fine.

254
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,500
You live according to god's
600 commitments, right?

255
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:11,765
613.

256
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,000
You understand them all?

257
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,000
Takes a lifetime
of learning...

258
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:15,865
But you follow
the ones

259
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,700
You don't understand because
the ones you do understand

260
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:18,865
Make sense, and you believe

261
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,000
The guy who created them
knows what he's doing.

262
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,365
Of course.

263
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,200
So you will trust
my diagnosis

264
00:12:24,235 --> 00:12:25,965
And you'll let me
treat her,

265
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
<i>Because in this temple,
i am dr. Yahweh.</i>

266
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
I want a new doctor.

267
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,700
I'm starting her
on indomethacin

268
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:39,517
For cryoglobulinemia.

269
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:41,265
People don't change.

270
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,400
For example, i'm gonna keep repeating
people don't change.

271
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:46,067
So alcoholics that successfully

272
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:47,700
Go through treatment
don't exist.

273
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,400
They're still alcoholics.

274
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,150
If they never take a drink
as long as they live,

275
00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:52,800
It's only 'cause
they didn't live long enough.

276
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,000
If you're dissatisfied
with your life,

277
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,700
Changing it is a symptom
of mental health.

278
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,600
I get why that concept
is strange to you.

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,965
O2 sats are 85.

280
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
<i>She's hypoxic.
We might need to intubate.</i>

281
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,065
What's wrong with her?

282
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,700
It's definitely not
cryoglobulinemia.

283
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Better ask him.

284
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,750
<i>We kept her
on oxygen overnight.</i>

285
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:24,492
Her respiratory rate
stabilized,

286
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,200
And her o-Sat's
back up to 95.

287
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
I saw amber drop off wilson
this morning.

288
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes, the male
always drives the female.

289
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,165
So what caused
the breathing problem?

290
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,800
Pulmonary involvement
rules out porphyria.

291
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:37,100
She kiss him or he kiss her?

292
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:37,965
I missed it.

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,050
The lab tech with the tongue
stud also pulled up.

294
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,065
Wegener's would explain
her elevated sed rate.

295
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,600
Wegener's wouldn't explain
the changed mental status.

296
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:45,700
Actually, we've
been trying to ignore

297
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:47,300
That part
of the whiteboard.

298
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,000
I wrote it in black.

299
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,100
I'm always serious
when i use black.

300
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,350
- Lupus would explain-
- Maybe she didn't change.

301
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:55,100
Are you agreeing with me
or you making a point?

302
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,500
I'm making a point.

303
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,565
That's gonna take longer.

304
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,865
<i>How do we know
that the real roz</i>

305
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,100
Isn't who she is now
and who she was then?

306
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,200
<i>Can't we say that
her previous life was true</i>

307
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:05,100
Without making
her present one a fraud?

308
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,865
"Life is messy" argument.
Nice.

309
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,700
<i>Explains everything
without explaining anything.</i>

310
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,800
If it's lupus,
there's a heart problem

311
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:12,100
<i>We don't know about yet.</i>

312
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,465
Run her through
a stress test.

313
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,200
If she has a heart attack,
i'm right.

314
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:16,565
Or we could wait,
hope that-

315
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,900
You're afraid
to give her a heart attack.

316
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:19,017
Of course we're afraid-

317
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:20,100
No reason to be afraid.

318
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,100
Unless you think i'm right.

319
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,700
It's wegener's.

320
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
But we'll have the crash cart
just in case.

321
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,200
Oh, my god!
What are you guys doing here?

322
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,700
I had a sudden yen
for fusion.

323
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,100
I put a different restaurant
in my date book.

324
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,300
I'm firing my assistant.

325
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:47,267
That's okay.

326
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:48,200
Hi, greg.

327
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,500
And i call you Greg because
we're now social equals.

328
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I call you
cutthroat bitch...

329
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,900
<i>Well,
quod erat demonstrandum.</i>

330
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,065
And i speak in latin

331
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,400
Because i don't try to hide
what an ass i am.

332
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,065
I assume you'd like
to join us?

333
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,800
It'll be easier
to observe our interaction

334
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:06,000
If you're at the same table.

335
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,600
If we ever get seated.

336
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,700
Excuse me.

337
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,400
No, no, i, uh-

338
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,500
We've been waiting for...

339
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:14,165
<i>Any minute now,</i>

340
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,500
She's gonna hit him
in the face

341
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:17,000
With your testicles.

342
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,700
She tends to treat e-

343
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,565
She tends to treat
every event

344
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,700
Like it's the last copter
out of saigon.

345
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,550
<i>She's the anti-Wilson.</i>

346
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:27,000
She's a force
for evil.

347
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,000
She has
an annoying quality.

348
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:30,165
Perhaps even two.

349
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,000
If i was perfect,
i would date perfect.

350
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,900
You like that!

351
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,100
It's annoying,
but she's good at it.

352
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,000
Wait a second.

353
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,300
This isn't just
about the sex.

354
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,100
You like her personality.
You like that she's conniving.

355
00:15:50,135 --> 00:15:52,867
You like that she has
no regard for consequences.

356
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:55,600
You like that she can
humiliate someone if it serves-

357
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
Oh, my god.

358
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,800
You're sleeping with me.

359
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,300
I need you to go faster, roz.

360
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,565
A little harder.

361
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,700
I am going harder,
damn it.

362
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
What if dr. House
was right?

363
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,200
And roz did make
a radical change?

364
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,400
Lupus is chronic
but treatable.

365
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,950
And with the treatment,
it'd undo the change?

366
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:40,400
She'll be the way she was
before i knew her?

367
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,100
I don't think it's likely.

368
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,700
Then you don't know for sure.

369
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
You'd find someone else.

370
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,800
There isn't someone else.

371
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,100
You've had three dates.

372
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,700
How long have you
been married?

373
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,865
12 years.

374
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,400
And is she the one?

375
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
We wouldn't still be together
if she weren't.

376
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,367
I love her as much now
as the day-

377
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:11,000
<i>Well, you should
love her more.</i>

378
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,500
The more you know someone,

379
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,200
The more you
should love them.

380
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,800
Okay, that's enough, roz.

381
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,500
Okay, your heart's
as strong as a battleship.

382
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:32,300
<i>Does this mean
dr. House was wrong?</i>

383
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
Oh! Oh, my leg!

384
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Heart's strong enough
to prove you wrong

385
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:44,400
About the change
in mental status.

386
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,865
Only proves
this isn't lupus.

387
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,000
Just as the leg pain proves
it isn't wegener's.

388
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,700
Leg pain can be
from nerve entrapment.

389
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:51,900
We're thinking
blood clot.

390
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,900
Do an mri
to look for the clot.

391
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,565
Then do an fmri.

392
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,200
- An mri alone...
- If the clot hasn't dissolved.

393
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:01,800
An fmri can show signs
of near-Ischemic stroke

394
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:03,600
In post-Ischemic parts
of the brain.

395
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,600
- Give me ten bucks.
- No.

396
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:06,465
I missed lunch.

397
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,800
- I thought you went-
- I missed lunch.

398
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,300
Good symmetrical activity
in both hemispheres.

399
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,400
Caudal structures look okay.

400
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,500
She hasn't changed?

401
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,965
<i>Sex, drugs,
rock and roll,</i>

402
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,300
The 600 rules of god
are all in there somewhere.

403
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:28,000
We oversimplify people.

404
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,750
<i>It's how
the human mind works.</i>

405
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:31,342
<i>Everything's
on or off.</i>

406
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,900
Everything's got a category.

407
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,500
You don't like it.

408
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
You don't wanna be
oversimplified.

409
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,400
Roz, move your right leg.

410
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,800
No one can describe themselves
in ten words.

411
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,700
Why would we want to hear
anyone else do it?

412
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:47,200
So you keep it a mystery.

413
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,065
No categories
if no one knows anything.

414
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,000
Do you think maybe
you're oversimplifying me now?

415
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:52,100
No.

416
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,550
I'm sure you have
many reasons

417
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:55,865
To keep yourself a mystery,

418
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,700
Besides the fact
that you're bisexual.

419
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,200
Uh... denial would have worked
before the long, vacant stare.

420
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:06,400
Roz, move your left leg
just an inch.

421
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,500
People who have a problem
with boxes

422
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:12,200
Are people
who don't fit in them.

423
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,300
You've been working
for house for a long time.

424
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,700
No need for name calling.

425
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,100
I would ask if this
was gonna be lunchtime gossip,

426
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:21,267
But lucky for me-

427
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:22,400
I don't give a damn.

428
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,000
How's our mental yentl?

429
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,900
Mri shows no sign
of clots.

430
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,500
<i>Fmri shows
no problem areas.</i>

431
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:33,065
Go restart her iv.

432
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,365
- What's wrong with it?
- Nothing.

433
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,200
But like so many procedures
we put patients through,

434
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,365
It hurts.

435
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,200
Which, if she's enjoying it,
will show up in pretty colors.

436
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,765
This is why you wanted
an fmri?

437
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,450
It showed she didn't
have a blood clot,

438
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,100
<i>Which is diagnostically
relevant.</i>

439
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,100
And it can show
if she's become a masochist-

440
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:51,000
Also diagnostically relevant.

441
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:52,300
And it'll be cool.

442
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
Either will explain which part
of my analysis makes sense.

443
00:19:57,435 --> 00:19:58,900
Or go do it.

444
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
It isn't cool.

445
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,800
I'm sorry.

446
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,465
<i>Heavens.
Look at her limbic system.</i>

447
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,400
<i>Pleasure centers are lighting
up like a hanukah bush.</i>

448
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,900
Foreman must have
a touch like an elephant.

449
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay, roz.
We've got what we need.

450
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,700
Yes, it was impressive.

451
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Roz.

452
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,300
You all right?

453
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,800
I'm sorry.
I was praying.

454
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,100
All through
the procedure?

455
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:47,965
No.

456
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,565
When dr. Foreman
apologized,

457
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,800
I knew something bad
was gonna happen.

458
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
She was praying.

459
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,000
<i>Could explain
the brain activity.</i>

460
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,300
Bp, nd heart rate
are dropping.

461
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:10,000
She's crashing.

462
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,300
She's stabilizing.

463
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,700
Get her up.

464
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,300
All the way up.
On her feet.

465
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Make her do that again.

466
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,800
We started her on
fludrocortisone and ephedrine.

467
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,100
<i>It's planet of the apes.</i>

468
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,250
Apes are the humans,
humans are the apes.

469
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>It's wacky wednesday,
opposite day.</i>

470
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:00,565
<i>When you stand up,</i>

471
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,400
Your bp and heart rate
are supposed to go up, not-

472
00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:03,400
Got it.

473
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,300
So what causes bloody urine,

474
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Loss of bladder control,
leg pain, altered mental status,

475
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:11,600
And pressure-Blood
in direction-Wrong?

476
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:13,065
Pheochromocytoma.

477
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,465
Low catecholamines
in the urine

478
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,700
Means no pheochromocytoma
in the jewess.

479
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,500
Could be
systemic sclerosis.

480
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Mental status.

481
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,865
She was praying.

482
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,500
She was in pain.
You no longer think she's crazy?

483
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,850
I can see why she'd be attracted
to that life.

484
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:29,592
You drank the
manishevitz-Flavored kool-Aid.

485
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:32,265
I'm not saying i agree.
I'm just saying-

486
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,600
That there's a rational basis
for the irrational.

487
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:36,600
They have something
we don't have.

488
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:37,665
Imaginary friends.

489
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,865
If the toaster's not working,
wiring could be bad.

490
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,000
Which debate is that metaphor
supposed to help us with?

491
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:43,165
Electrical problem
in the heart.

492
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,000
<i>Arrhythmia messes with
the blood flow when she stands,</i>

493
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:46,467
<i>Causes low bp and heart rate.</i>

494
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:47,900
Could also impact
mental status.

495
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:49,000
Everybody's happy.

496
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,065
Run an ep study of her heart.

497
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,900
<i>Find where the wiring's
verklempt.</i>

498
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,200
Went by your hotel
this morning.

499
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
They told me
you moved out.

500
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,965
Moved in with c. B.?

501
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,965
No, apparently,
i moved in with you.

502
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,900
The very fact
that you're resisting my insight

503
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:08,765
Proves to me-

504
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,000
House, you're right.

505
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,300
Why not?
Why not date you?

506
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,665
It's brilliant.

507
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,065
We've known each other
for years,

508
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,300
We've put up with all kinds
of crap from each other,

509
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:20,000
And we keep coming back.

510
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,400
We're a couple.

511
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,000
Are we still speaking
metaphorically?

512
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,365
<i>Amber is exactly
what i need</i>

513
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,200
And you would agree if you
weren't mired in self-Loathing

514
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:30,365
Topped with a thin crust
of megalomania.

515
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Hey. That's my best friend's
girl you're talking about.

516
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,300
I was wrong.

517
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,200
House, you're right.

518
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,400
She's not me.
Well, she is me.

519
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,900
But that's not why
she's attractive.

520
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,300
She's a needy version
of me.

521
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,065
Hard to imagine
such a mythical creature.

522
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,700
You started seeing her
right after i fired her.

523
00:23:51,735 --> 00:23:53,900
I started seeing her
four months ago.

524
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
She told kutner
it was four weeks.

525
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
You lied to me.

526
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,200
There was money
on the line.

527
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:00,365
Because i knew
how you'd react,

528
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
And i knew you
wouldn't pay me anyway.

529
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:03,300
You knew that i was right.

530
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,965
She wasn't needy.

531
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,100
She was in a...
bad situation.

532
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
There's a difference.

533
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,100
Not to your libido.

534
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,900
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

535
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,465
Why are you doing this?

536
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,100
Every time i agree with you,
you find a new argument.

537
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,800
What are you
trying to avoid?

538
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,600
Well, if you'd looked at me
with those flashing eyes

539
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:29,300
Before i was involved...

540
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

541
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,600
And... i use
the french because...

542
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,000
You're an ass.

543
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,600
Right atrium normal,
no arrhythmia.

544
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,800
You can become
a d'har master.

545
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,600
Does that require
further explanation?

546
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,565
Right ventricle normal.

547
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,700
In college, i was really
into science fiction-

548
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,200
Not like the guys
with the $600 prosthetic ears

549
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:55,165
Who could swear in romulan,

550
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,865
That was embarrassing
to the rest of us

551
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Who just thought it was
good, smart literature.

552
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,265
Went to one convention.

553
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,000
By senior year, i was d'har
master in the klingon empire.

554
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,265
I'm not gonna become
hasidic.

555
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,700
I'm not even gonna become
slightly more reformed.

556
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,765
Coronary sinus normal.

557
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
You can't have your eyes opened
to something and not act on it.

558
00:25:11,835 --> 00:25:13,565
I haven't had
my eyes opened.

559
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,200
I just... don't think
they're crazy anymore.

560
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,800
Then they have
something to offer.

561
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,665
She's living proof

562
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,650
<i>That sane people
can make radical changes.</i>

563
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:24,600
But house, he thinks
that he can bully-

564
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:26,600
<i>No loshon hora.</i>

565
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,500
I'm sorry?

566
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
I think she's telling you
to stop deflecting.

567
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:32,000
<i>No loshon hora.</i>

568
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,800
<i>Evil tongue.</i>

569
00:25:33,835 --> 00:25:34,617
Gossip.

570
00:25:34,652 --> 00:25:35,365
It's okay.

571
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,500
Thanks to the sedative,
you won't remember it.

572
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,000
Words are permanent.

573
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,865
<i>Someday you'll say something</i>

574
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,100
That you'll wish
you could take back.

575
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,400
This bundle's normal.

576
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
Pathways are all clean.
No arrhythmias.

577
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:51,265
If the toaster doesn't work

578
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,665
And the wiring
in the house is fine,

579
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,365
Problem's gotta be
in the city's power grid.

580
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,000
Autonomic nerve disorder
could be riley-Day syndrome.

581
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,565
Congratulations
on your wedding.

582
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,700
You have a rare and incurable
degenerative disease.

583
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,900
I'll set up for
a thermoregulatory sweat test.

584
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
She's a bisexual.

585
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,100
What?

586
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,500
I could hear them talking
from inside the mri.

587
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,565
Hear who?
I heard the word sex.

588
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,200
<i>- It was interesting.
- What was interesting?</i>

589
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:18,967
It doesn't matter.

590
00:26:19,002 --> 00:26:19,665
We're doctors.

591
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,800
We never know
what's gonna matter.

592
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:21,865
She said sex.

593
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
If she wants to tell you
when she wakes up...

594
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,100
Yeah, these people
aren't gonna change you at all.

595
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,500
I need you to sleep
with wilson.

596
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
Good morning.

597
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,900
He's involved
with an inappropriate woman.

598
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,200
His people are sheepherders
and amber's are cattlemen?

599
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:43,017
He's combining two
of his worst qualities-

600
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:44,800
His love for me
and his love for need.

601
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,850
<i>As administrator
of this hospital,</i>

602
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:48,800
You have to save
your star oncologist.

603
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,300
Wish i could help,
but as administrator,

604
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,017
There are some people
in accounting

605
00:26:53,052 --> 00:26:54,700
I'm scheduled
to sleep with first.

606
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,665
Wilson has a pattern
with women.

607
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,600
<i>He saves them,
then he betrays them,</i>

608
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:02,300
Which then causes guilt...

609
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,350
Which then causes him
to go save somebody else.

610
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:08,000
For example, a hospital
bureaucrat nearing 40

611
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,300
Who has no personal life.

612
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,900
I suggest
you go braless.

613
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,600
I get that "sleep with"
is your way of saying

614
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:15,200
I should talk to him?

615
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,800
No. I really mean
sleep with.

616
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,265
You're not worried

617
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,400
You're worried
it'll succeed.

618
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,100
That wilson will no longer be
at your beck and call 24/7.

619
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:26,765
That your best friend
will change.

620
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,500
People don't change just
because they wish they could.

621
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:32,000
And it bugs you
that he wishes he could!

622
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,300
You'll never lose
your friend, house.

623
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,600
You're the long-Distance runner
of neediness.

624
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,165
<i>As the chamber heats up,</i>

625
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,165
<i>Roz's body temperature
should also rise,</i>

626
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,900
Making her sweat
and turning the powder purple.

627
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,065
No change in color
means no sweating,

628
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,900
Which means her central
nervous system is damaged.

629
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
I shouldn't
see her like this.

630
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,265
We could have a diagnosis

631
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,700
As soon as she comes
out of the chamber.

632
00:27:56,735 --> 00:27:57,800
It might be better
if you stayed.

633
00:27:57,835 --> 00:27:59,300
It's disrespectful.

634
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,665
I'm sure sure she imagined

635
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,765
<i>The first time
her husband would see her</i>

636
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Bare like this would be
celebrating the marriage.

637
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:08,165
Given the circumstances,

638
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,900
I think roz
would sacrifice modesty

639
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:11,300
To have you with her.

640
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Please.
Don't do that.

641
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,000
What? I think it's nice
that you're here.

642
00:28:18,035 --> 00:28:19,800
- I think-
- You think it's sweet...

643
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,365
That i care for her modesty,

644
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,100
But that it's archaic
and ultimately irrelevant.

645
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,800
Our traditions
aren't just blind rituals.

646
00:28:27,835 --> 00:28:29,900
They... they mean something.

647
00:28:29,935 --> 00:28:32,100
They have purpose.

648
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,600
I respect my wife.

649
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,400
And i respect her body.

650
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,200
Her body temperature's
stopped climbing.

651
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,165
What's going on?

652
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,300
She's having a seizure!
We need a crash cart!

653
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,000
Blankets too!
She's freezing.

654
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,950
<i>She was supposed to sweat
and she froze.</i>

655
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:01,600
<i>Return to the planet
of the apes.</i>

656
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,450
Hypothermia caused the seizure.

657
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:05,200
What caused the hypothermia?

658
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,365
<i>It could be an infection.</i>

659
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,000
<i>Her white blood cell
count was fine.</i>

660
00:29:08,035 --> 00:29:08,665
When she was admitted.

661
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,100
She could have picked
something up here.

662
00:29:10,135 --> 00:29:12,000
Complication
on a complication?

663
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,800
Body's doing the opposite
of what it's supposed to.

664
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,000
Her body's wilson.

665
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,950
How do we respond to that?

666
00:29:17,985 --> 00:29:19,300
We accept
that he's happy.

667
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,465
We do the opposite.

668
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
So you want us to what,
send the patient home?

669
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,065
Infection... means that

670
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,750
Something's been added
to the body,

671
00:29:26,785 --> 00:29:28,400
Something that should
be expelled.

672
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,100
What's the opposite
of that?

673
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,600
Something missing
from the body.

674
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,600
Could be an enzyme
or a hormone.

675
00:29:33,635 --> 00:29:35,300
Cortisol.
Could be addison's.

676
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,900
It fits.

677
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,065
Every symptom.

678
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,200
I'll run a cortisol
stimulation test.

679
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Are you sure
she doesn't wanna just

680
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,500
Take you back to her lair,
hang you upside down,

681
00:29:52,535 --> 00:29:54,100
And deposit her eggs
in you?

682
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,400
Excellent disguise,
house.

683
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,400
You two are really
that serious?

684
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,265
She's pretty.
She's funny.

685
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,550
- Maybe she's a little more...
- Evil?

686
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:06,800
Aggressive than
you'd expect from me.

687
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:08,300
But i'm happy.

688
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,000
Can't i just enjoy what
that feels like for a while?

689
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,000
How many people have looked
at you trustingly

690
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:15,065
While you gave them
a fatal prognosis,

691
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,200
But you knew it was kinder
to tell them the truth?

692
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,465
Amber compulsively looks out
for number one.

693
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,800
You compulsively look out
for the person that you're with.

694
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,965
Your needs are gonna feed
her needs

695
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,400
Until all that's left
is a wilson chalk outline

696
00:30:31,435 --> 00:30:32,800
On the floor.

697
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Sorry.

698
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Wow!

699
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,500
That cortisol stuff
is great.

700
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,300
Does it work
on everything?

701
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,800
I take it
you're feeling better.

702
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:52,317
Oh, still weak.

703
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:53,800
<i>But yeah.</i>

704
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
You must be so tired.

705
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,300
You should go home
and get some sleep.

706
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,400
I'll stay.

707
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,600
I never told you,
but you are much better looking

708
00:31:06,635 --> 00:31:08,800
Than mrs. Silver
led me to expect.

709
00:31:08,835 --> 00:31:09,617
<i>She never liked me.</i>

710
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:10,365
When i was eight,

711
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,600
I threw up on her shoes
at my uncle's wedding.

712
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,800
Your abdomen's
a little swollen.

713
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,365
Mm?

714
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,350
Is it serious?

715
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:18,265
It's hard to say.

716
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,800
Sometimes it can mean
a liver issue.

717
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:22,467
- We'll have to test.
- Oh...

718
00:31:22,502 --> 00:31:25,100
Oh, dizziness
is getting-

719
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,665
She's going into shock.

720
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,200
I need another liter of saline.
Type and cross two units.

721
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:31,500
What's happening
to her?

722
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,850
She's bleeding internally.

723
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:38,100
<i>She's saying the shema.</i>

724
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,000
She thinks she's dying.

725
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,600
The mri shows
you're bleeding internally,

726
00:31:46,635 --> 00:31:48,500
But not where
it's coming from.

727
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,850
The blood can only
keep you stable for so long.

728
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:54,700
Our best option
is to open you up and search.

729
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:56,100
But you can fix it?

730
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,900
If we find the leak.

731
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,200
You find the bleeding,
you find the disease?

732
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,700
No.

733
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,765
But it could keep you alive
long enough

734
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,500
So dr. House can find
what's wrong with you.

735
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,300
No.

736
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,700
I don't want to have
the surgery...

737
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:21,300
It's the only chance
you've got.

738
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,900
I don't want to have
the surgery

739
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:25,900
Until after sunset.

740
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm probably
gonna die anyway.

741
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,100
I just wanna share
one shabbat with my husband.

742
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,500
Roz, please.

743
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,000
The torah commands us
to preserve life.

744
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,100
I waited 38 years
to find what i wanted.

745
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,000
I can wait
another eight hours.

746
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,400
I'll leave the rest
to god, okay?

747
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,300
I had a rabbi call.

748
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,700
She's adamant.

749
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,900
She's not a masochist.

750
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,300
She's suicidal.

751
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,065
Nice work, chase.

752
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,600
Yeah. I should have
had twin rabbis call.

753
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:19,500
Can i go?

754
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,700
We need you.

755
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,200
So instead of a few days
we now have a few hours

756
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:26,500
To figure this out.

757
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,865
- Nice work, chase.
- Why do you need me?

758
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,500
Saying, "nice work, chase"
when you're not here

759
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:31,800
<i>Is pointless.</i>

760
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
Seriously, we need you.

761
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,800
We should x-Ray
for malformations of the rib

762
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:42,617
That could cause
arterial twisting.

763
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:44,400
Malformations don't cause
bloody urine.

764
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:45,800
She's not suicidal.

765
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,650
<i>She made a commitment
to a new life with her husband</i>

766
00:33:48,685 --> 00:33:51,300
And she wants one meaningful
experience in that life.

767
00:33:51,335 --> 00:33:53,165
<i>- She just met the guy.
- Taub just met her.</i>

768
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
And he's already so in love,
he's ready to let her die

769
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:57,067
<i>And take her back
to the home planet</i>

770
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:58,900
For a burial
in the lava sea of tormiad.

771
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,200
It's who he might be.

772
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,400
She's connecting with all
the years she's not gonna have.

773
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:06,000
Better way of connecting
to those years

774
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:07,500
Is to actually have them.

775
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,000
You want more time?

776
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,100
Joshua got god to make
the sun stand still.

777
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,500
No reason
god can't speed it up.

778
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,900
And, by god,
i of course mean you.

779
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,200
Told you
we needed you.

780
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,300
It's sundown, roz.

781
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
We're taking you back
to your room

782
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:33,000
For your candlelight
dinner.

783
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,400
Ready?
One, two three.

784
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,965
It's too early.

785
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,300
Your sense of time is off
because of the medication.

786
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,200
<i>Good shabbos, roz.</i>

787
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,000
So you pray,
scarf down some challah,

788
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:08,400
Then we can do this?

789
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,100
<i>You wanted
to see me?</i>

790
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
And you came.

791
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,465
I feel pretty confident

792
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,100
It'll be
something interesting.

793
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,100
Solvis case
and the job is yours.

794
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,500
Is there a "drop wilson" clause
attached to this?

795
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,800
Standard contract
all employees sign.

796
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,000
Why do you have to believe
i have an ulterior motive?

797
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,265
For the same reason
i believe

798
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,900
That crack whores
can have sex for crack.

799
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,200
All my life

800
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,450
I thought
i had to choose

801
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:15,200
Between love
and respect.

802
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,000
And i chose respect.

803
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,300
And with wilson...

804
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,300
I know what it's like
to have both.

805
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,200
And that beats
a fellowship.

806
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,000
Could be d. I.C.

807
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,200
You've changed.

808
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,200
I hope so.

809
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,200
Normal platelet count
rules out d. I.C.

810
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:03,600
Good try though.

811
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,765
I read that a hydatid cyst
could-

812
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,400
Would affect the lungs,
not the bladder.

813
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:50,200
Tested her white cell
count again.

814
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,300
Normal.

815
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,865
How long till we
get to cut her open?

816
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,800
<i>When i left, he was still
singing eshet something.</i>

817
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:57,700
The husband's blessing
of his wife.

818
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,400
Woman of valor.

819
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,800
"Strength and honor
are her clothing.

820
00:38:05,835 --> 00:38:07,500
She laughs at the future. "

821
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,500
Because she's an idiot.

822
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,600
Volvulus of the small intestine
could cause bleeding.

823
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,400
She would have had
constipation.

824
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,700
Her value
isn't "beyond pearls" either.

825
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,500
'Cause dead people
have no value.

826
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,000
Polycythemia vera.

827
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,700
Rbc count would be higher.

828
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
I need to bring
the light to my face.

829
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Thrombocytopenia.
If it's autoimmune-

830
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:39,300
Titers were normal.

831
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,100
Parkinson's would explain
the hypothermia.

832
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:43,500
<i>Not the bloody urine.</i>

833
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,200
The woman's not just
a masochist, she's a hypocrite.

834
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,600
The commandment
to preserve life

835
00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:51,300
Comes before all others.

836
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
<i>Actually means she's
not a masochist.</i>

837
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,850
<i>She's not following
all the rules,</i>

838
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:56,200
Just the ones
that please her.

839
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:57,665
Right, she walked in crazy

840
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,600
And explained how ritual
trumps living,

841
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:01,500
And you decide
it's a beautiful lifestyle.

842
00:39:01,535 --> 00:39:03,365
I know.
She's wrong.

843
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,150
But if there's
nothing more-

844
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:06,900
Then the only meaning
is here.

845
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,265
But if she thinks
god is there for her,

846
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,100
If she lives her life
believing that god is there-

847
00:39:13,135 --> 00:39:14,400
Then she dies.

848
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,500
Things aren't where
we want them to be

849
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:21,100
Just because
we want them to be there.

850
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,000
Of course, that doesn't mean
they're where they should be.

851
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,300
Hey!

852
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,100
<i>Stop that jew.</i>

853
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
<i>Chase hates working
on shabbos.</i>

854
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,100
Gonna make this easier for him.
Stand her up.

855
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,500
She doesn't do so well
on her feet.

856
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:44,500
<i>Neither do i.
Stand her up.</i>

857
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,400
<i>You can tell all the ladies
at the mikvah about this.</i>

858
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,300
What did you do?

859
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,000
What are you doing?

860
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,800
Put your hand here.

861
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,700
Press hard.

862
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,200
You have nephroptosis.

863
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,900
<i>Also known as
"floating kidney. "</i>

864
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,500
The kidney's
like a chandelier.

865
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,900
It's attached to a ceiling of
intestines and blood vessels.

866
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,100
But your contractor-
Think you know who he is-

867
00:40:41,135 --> 00:40:42,665
He hung it
with a cheap chain.

868
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,500
It's been hanging sloppy
for years.

869
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:46,617
Finally something
shook it loose.

870
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,700
<i>After that,
every time you stood,</i>

871
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,800
Your kidney dropped
a few centimeters,

872
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,165
Caused all your symptoms.

873
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,465
None of the scans
picked it up.

874
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,550
Because we do scans
with patients lying down.

875
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:57,600
<i>She'd have been lying down
in surgery too.</i>

876
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Never have found it.

877
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,500
Good chance
she'd never come out.

878
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:01,717
She'll be all right?

879
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:02,900
Ultrasound to confirm,

880
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,500
Then tell chase to put
the kidney back on the shelf.

881
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,200
The bleed will be nearby.

882
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,200
That's... it?

883
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,000
Mazel tov.

884
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,465
Couple hours surgery,

885
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,000
You'll be ready
to push out those 14 children.

886
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,300
You do it both ways,
right?

887
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,265
What?

888
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,700
The ultrasound-You do it
standing up and lying down.

889
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,000
What else would i mean?

890
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,600
I've decided
you could do worse

891
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:50,500
Than a female proxy
for me.

892
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,500
So you're going to acknowledge
that people can change?

893
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,265
No.

894
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,000
You think i've changed
or amber's changed?

895
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:10,800
Nope.

896
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,765
Then you've changed.

897
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,850
If you do change,
can it be the part of you

898
00:42:14,885 --> 00:42:16,900
That chases me down halls,
trying to change me?

899
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,065
Do you know
what this means?

900
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,500
That you made
one go dating choice.

901
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,600
The fabric of the space/time
continuum could unravel.

902
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,800
My world could expand.

903
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,900
I could form
a long-Term connection

904
00:42:30,935 --> 00:42:32,100
That isn't with you.

905
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:32,965
And since you put

906
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,500
The darkest possible
construction on everything,

907
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,800
You could end up
losing a friend.

908
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,100
You've thought
of all this.

909
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,665
<i>And yet...</i>

910
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,000
You're going along with it.

911
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,700
Are you being...
self-Sacrificing?

912
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,450
I'll sacrifice a lab rat,

913
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:56,565
I'll sacrifice a fly,

914
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,800
And i'll sacrifice $200
on a mudder at monmouth park.

915
00:42:59,835 --> 00:43:01,400
I don't sacrifice self.

916
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,900
<i>Shabbat shalom, wilson.</i>

917
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,265
<i>Shabbat shalom, house.</i>
