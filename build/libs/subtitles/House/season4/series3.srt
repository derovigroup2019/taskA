1
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,815
It's cold.

2
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,956
Good. Thank you.

3
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,016
There's a new girl at
the ice cream store.

4
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,586
She doesn't seem too fond
of buttoning her top button.

5
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,153
Let's go check her out.

6
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,442
What are we supposed to be doing?

7
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,677
It's almost 4:00.

8
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,218
You got somewhere to be?

9
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,345
We know he likes to manipulate people.

10
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,447
He's probably testing us.

11
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,253
To find out what?

12
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,123
How long we can look stupid for?

13
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,959
He said he'd be here by 3:00.

14
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,862
He's obviously not coming.

15
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,395
I'm going home. Nobody follow her.

16
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,803
She Pied Pipered nine people
right out of a job last week.

17
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,309
Would you mind holding
my metaphor for a second?

18
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,406
New patient,
37-year-old male.

19
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,782
Suffers from severe
ascending muscle weakness.

20
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,684
Why are you late? To
see who'd put up with it.

21
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,346
So, if we'd have left,
we would have been fired?

22
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,448
I was going to fire
whoever stuck around,

23
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,256
but since everyone stuck around...

24
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:49,127
28% curvature of the spine has
caused reduced lung capacity

25
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,931
and he has reduced the
bone mineral density.

26
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,404
The patient has spinal muscular atrophy.

27
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,964
It's genetic, incurable.

28
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,939
This is not a diagnostic mystery.

29
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,673
You have just given the
state secrets to the enemy.

30
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,714
What enemy? New patient, new rules.

31
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,342
Today, you're going to split
yourselves into two teams.

32
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,784
The first to figure out what's
threatening to deprive the patient

33
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,049
of the 20 or so miserable
years he's got left

34
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,751
with SMA gets to keep their jobs.

35
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,123
Take off your numbers. You look stupid.

36
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,662
And I think I know who you are by now.

37
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,458
Wait, how do you want us to split up?

38
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,058
Good question, Overly
Excited Former Foster Kid.

39
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,261
There's 10 of you.

40
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,497
I was thinking six
against six? No, wait.

41
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,130
How about women versus men?

42
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,801
Excellent suggestion, Fat Twin.

43
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,037
More interesting than evens versus odds.

44
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,579
Less interesting than
shirts against skins.

45
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,912
If your sex organs dangle,
you're the Confederates.

46
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,976
If your sex organs are aesthetically
pleasing, you're the Yanks.

47
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,285
Dr. House? I'd like to
be on the men's team.

48
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,053
Do your sex organs
dangle, Cutthroat Bitch?

49
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,356
Not yet. You've never hired more

50
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,488
than one female on your team before.

51
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,259
If you're going to
purge an entire gender

52
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,358
it isn't going to be the danglers.

53
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:59,064
Sounds logical, if you don't think
about it for more than three seconds.

54
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,834
I just told you that if the
danglers lose, they're out.

55
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,376
So, I can only assume you're
hiding the real reason.

56
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,342
You don't think the women
will be aggressive enough,

57
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,403
will be good enough at science.
They'll be too emotional.

58
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,948
Can I switch teams?

59
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,583
If the danglers are okay, I'm okay.

60
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,780
We're not okay. I get it.

61
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,551
You don't like me because maybe
I'm a little bit competitive.

62
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,649
Manipulative.

63
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,353
"Cutthroat Bitch" is
your official title.

64
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,861
It's a game. You can either
play for fun or play to win.

65
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,865
If you want to win,
you want "Cutthroat".

66
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,996
No, thank you.

67
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,434
First thing we have to
do is get inside his head.

68
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,697
It's not psychological.

69
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,036
I'm not talking about the
patient, I'm talking about House.

70
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,633
He's insane, but he's not irresponsible.

71
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,201
He wouldn't be playing this game if
he didn't already know the answer.

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,111
The first thing we do
is gang-bang the sucker.

73
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,013
There's five of us. We
can run dozens of tests.

74
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,177
We don't need a theory.
We just need brute force.

75
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,845
What about the assist dog?

76
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,118
Picks bacteria-infested things up
with its bacteria-infested mouth,

77
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,317
hands them over to the guy...

78
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,883
It's not the dog, wouldn't be fair.

79
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,088
To who? Whom.

80
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,825
The men. House knows I used to be a vet.

81
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,197
If the dog's the answer,
they'd be at a handicap.

82
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,633
What about the dog?

83
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,068
Assist dogs put
everything in their mouth.

84
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,469
Money, doorknobs...

85
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,632
Great. That's not what I said.

86
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,403
Why do you think a
low sodium... I don't.

87
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,569
Patient took a trip to
Thailand two weeks ago.

88
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,170
Hey, write bigger and angle the
board more so they can see it.

89
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,408
This is wrong.

90
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,574
It's only wrong if they cheat off us.

91
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,878
And if they cheat off us, they're wrong.

92
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,318
They're not cheating,
but one of them is moving.

93
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,092
Hey. Stop playing with your
sutures or I'll have to re-do them.

94
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,689
Why do you guys keep a D-cell
battery in a urine specimen cup?

95
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,858
Because we pulled it from
a patient's intestine.

96
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,198
Why would somebody swallow a battery?

97
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,500
Why do you assume it was swallowed?

98
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,631
Bed five needs a bag
of Ringer's lactate.

99
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,302
Would have been worse
if he'd used a nine-volt.

100
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,368
Who said it was a "he"?

101
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,970
False assumptions. You're good.

102
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,378
You're trying to get
me to think like him.

103
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,782
And you're trying to kiss my
ass. Why are you talking to me?

104
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:56,981
Because House is turning patient
care into a game. It's dangerous.

105
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,991
The patient's going
to suffer. Maybe die.

106
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,000
Wow! You really need a shave.

107
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,100
See what I did there?

108
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:13,796
Whoa.

109
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,572
Interesting.

110
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,283
I need a crash cart in here!

111
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,290
I didn't do it.

112
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,926
When a person faints,
it's because they're

113
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,469
not getting enough blood to their brain.

114
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,698
The act of falling corrects the problem.

115
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,298
You faint again strapped into that
power chair where you can't fall,

116
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,775
you might not wake up.

117
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,539
Killed by an assistive device?

118
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,374
At least my death would be ironic.

119
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,573
I think when you went to Thailand,

120
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,083
you picked up a threadworm
called strongyloides.

121
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,346
They usually go up through your feet.

122
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,684
I didn't do a lot of
walking on the beach.

123
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,690
But I assume you did have
someone lay you down in the sand.

124
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,990
Bare back, bare legs increases
exposure tenfold over bare feet.

125
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,162
Two pills. You'll be all better.

126
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,837
Can I have some water for those, please?

127
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,337
Hey, take a number!

128
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,605
House didn't say anything
about taking turns.

129
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,771
What's she testing you for?

130
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,748
Don't. They'll spend all
day obsessing over my idea

131
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,978
instead of coming up
with one of their own.

132
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,020
And, hey, I might be wrong.

133
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,918
Seriously. I'm worried
that if we don't know

134
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,422
what she's given you,
there could be conflicts.

135
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,617
No, you're not.

136
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,785
House told me he's
keeping track of all that.

137
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,352
Ten doctors. I should
be getting ten cures.

138
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,160
We need blood, hair, and stool.

139
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,996
You poop and then you use the wooden

140
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,558
sticks to collect the fecal matter,

141
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,228
then rub it on the green box.

142
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,363
Hand it to my dog.

143
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,134
Only one of those things
I can do on my own.

144
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,336
And the last couple of days,
I haven't been doing that.

145
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,437
Is it all right with you if
we carry you into the bathroom?

146
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,972
If you want me there, that's the
way you're going to have to do it.

147
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,519
Okay.

148
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,718
Ready? Mmm-hmm.

149
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,695
One, two, three.

150
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,594
Can I get a little head support, please?

151
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,996
Thank you.

152
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,746
Why are you here?

153
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,686
My offices are being used by my teams.

154
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,617
Teams?

155
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,683
Which means this is the only
place where you can yell at me.

156
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:49,955
You have "teams"?

157
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,087
Two of them.

158
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,858
I wanted to deal with the yelling today

159
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,763
because I noticed what you were wearing,

160
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,064
and I wouldn't have to
listen all that closely.

161
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,662
You can't make a competition
out of patient care.

162
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:03,368
Without competition, we'd
still be single cell organisms.

163
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,876
Can I go now? Not
until after the yelling.

164
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:06,934
What's wrong with him?

165
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,140
I have seven of the finest minds on it.

166
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,375
Along with three very special...

167
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,508
You wouldn't be doing this
unless you already knew.

168
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,280
I tell you, you tell them. Game's over.

169
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,218
If you know, you are
obligated to treat...

170
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,951
Well, then, in that case, I don't know.

171
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,962
Why would a guy voluntarily shove

172
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,294
a metal object into
an electrical socket?

173
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,892
I'm getting closer and
closer to knowing the answer.

174
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,994
What would happen if
I shut down this game?

175
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,199
I'd fire them all, hire 40
new fellowship applicants

176
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,742
and start the game all over again.

177
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,778
You do know what's
wrong with him, right?

178
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,212
It would be pretty irresponsible
if I didn't, wouldn't it?

179
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,220
Antibiotics aren't working.

180
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,722
Legionella could explain
the lungs, the fever.

181
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,157
If she had Legionella,
she'd have low sodium.

182
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,989
What can you tell me about her?

183
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,552
She likes body surfing.

184
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,155
Maybe picked up a virus
swimming off Jones Beach.

185
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,757
But she doesn't even have the energy
to finish her crossword anymore.

186
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,927
Her boyfriend said...

187
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,231
That's it.

188
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,703
What is? Blurry vision.

189
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,672
How do you get blurry
vision from not being...

190
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,177
You don't stop a daily ritual that
cures boredom because you're bored.

191
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,802
She stopped doing her crossword puzzle

192
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,369
because she's having
a hard time reading it.

193
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,383
What causes fever, boggy
lungs, and blurry vision?

194
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,544
Fungal. Aspergillus would explain

195
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,850
the pneumonia, which explains the fever.

196
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,612
Start her on amphotericin.

197
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,787
Hey, guys. Great job.

198
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:42,840
If you were going to try to take
yourself out, why choose electricity?

199
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,342
You eat a bullet, jump off a building...

200
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,436
I love the team thing, by the way.

201
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,004
Bury yourself alive in Cuddy's cleavage.

202
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,574
Teamwork, collaboration,
all for the greater good...

203
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,814
It could have been a suicidal gesture

204
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,150
as opposed to an actual attempt.

205
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,885
Interestingly, the rain in Spain doesn't

206
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,986
actually fall in the
plain all that much.

207
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,789
But who puts their internal organs

208
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,891
on a skillet just to get attention?

209
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,265
Go ask him.

210
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,296
That would be cheating.

211
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,101
Got a diagnosis yet?

212
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,236
Get out of here.

213
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,438
Got a stool sample yet?

214
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,538
How could you know?

215
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,641
Oh, I talked to a nurse.
Pretty brilliant, huh?

216
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,051
I give you a move House will love
straight from one of his former fellows

217
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,486
and you let me join your team.

218
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,820
You're too late. We
already have our diagnosis.

219
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,020
He's lying because he
wants you to go away.

220
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,119
So do I.

221
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,629
How do we know you're
not a double agent?

222
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,563
Find out what we're thinking
then go back to the women.

223
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,464
Because I don't care
what you're thinking.

224
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,435
You want to know why I
want to be on your team?

225
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,697
Because you're idiots.

226
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,365
If I can get the women out
of the competition, I'm in.

227
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,374
And so are two of you.

228
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,517
So what's the big move?

229
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,056
It's called xenodiagnosis.

230
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,424
We let these bugs bite you, then
we test their feces for parasites.

231
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,225
Why can't you test my feces?

232
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,822
Because you've been chugging milk
of magnesia for the past hour.

233
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,164
You've got a lot going
in and nothing coming out.

234
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,797
Testing the bugs' feces is actually
more accurate than testing yours.

235
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,398
Smaller haystack, easier
to find the needle.

236
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,775
You okay? Get the bugs off him.

237
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,750
Get the bugs off him!

238
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,912
The test isn't done.

239
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,114
He's choking!

240
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,528
<i>Patchy infiltrates on
the X-ray, but patient</i>

241
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,627
<i>improved with chest PT and oxygen,</i>

242
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,137
<i>consistent with aspiration.</i>

243
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,332
So, now we have another
symptom to explain.

244
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,968
Why does his throat think
his lungs are his stomach?

245
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,840
And why are your throats closing up?

246
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,610
Shouldn't we be in separate rooms?

247
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,550
You think I'm going to run two
differentials at this time in the morning?

248
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,678
Grumpy, you're first.

249
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:09,743
I'm not grumpy.

250
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,518
Well, why would I call
you that if you weren't?

251
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,422
It's an unusual combination.

252
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,825
Unusual equals exotic equals foreign.

253
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,557
It has to be connected
to his trip to Thailand.

254
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,188
You practice medicine overseas?

255
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,530
I was with Doctors Without
Borders for eight years.

256
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,762
Ta-da! It's in my file.

257
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,168
David Blaine hides the six
of hearts in a beer bottle.

258
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,706
It's still impressive.

259
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,639
You like exotic. Why are you here?

260
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,767
I want this job.

261
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,438
Parent sick? No. I... I just...

262
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,912
This is not the job you want.

263
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,642
This is the job in
the zip code you want.

264
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:38,740
You engaged?

265
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,842
Yes.

266
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,943
Ta-da!

267
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,614
Am I not allowed to grow
up and change my priorities?

268
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,953
You're allowed to. People usually don't.

269
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,457
This is not a new symptom.

270
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,494
Our patient has spinal muscular atrophy.

271
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,462
He has documented trouble swallowing.

272
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,792
The choking is not new.

273
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,163
So, if it's nothing
new, what caused the old?

274
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,929
Strongyloides worms
explain the fainting.

275
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,333
We already treated...

276
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:02,170
So, he's all better,
woman who... Thirteen.

277
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,367
He hasn't gotten any worse.

278
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,807
That's a pretty passive approach

279
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,139
for the daughter of an alcoholic.

280
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,338
Wrong again.

281
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,109
We could stress his system,
put him on a tilt table.

282
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,171
If he stays conscious,

283
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,377
it means we made the
right diagnosis and we win.

284
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,010
Then, why haven't you?

285
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,781
Six against four.

286
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,420
One of the men is going to
have to join the women's team.

287
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,690
On the other hand, one of the men isn't

288
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,790
an actual doctor, so I
guess it's pretty fair.

289
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,636
Men, you're in the penalty box.

290
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,763
Who's not the doctor?

291
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,636
Glad you asked about that.

292
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,643
The reason I'm penalizing
you is time management.

293
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,703
In diagnostics, you're always
working against the clock.

294
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,044
The women came up with a theory
and they treated the patient.

295
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,549
You guys just sat around in a lab,

296
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,280
hoping a series of blind
tests would give you a theory.

297
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,822
You wasted the patient's time.

298
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,983
Now, I'm going to waste yours.

299
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,787
Her gums are turning yellow.

300
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,226
Whatever it is, it's in her liver now.

301
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,127
Fungal fit perfectly.

302
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,393
We were wrong.

303
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,628
And we're going to keep
being wrong until we're right.

304
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,192
Or until she dies.

305
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,863
Yeah. That was very helpful.

306
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,406
Need a team to tell me we're mortals.

307
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,576
Look. I'm sorry. You're right.

308
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:19,416
Doesn't hurt to be reminded that
we're dealing with real stakes, here.

309
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,919
Liver failure is a bad
thing, but it's also a clue.

310
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,717
What does it tell us?

311
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,894
I can't let you leave if I
think you're still suicidal.

312
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,867
I wasn't trying to off myself.

313
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,601
No, that's right, you were
just trying to kill the wall.

314
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,542
I check this box, and
your next roommates

315
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,671
are going to be Jesus
and Crazy McLoonybin.

316
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,845
That guy never had a chance.

317
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,544
It's going to sound stupid.

318
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,450
Suddenly, you're shy?

319
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,452
You pooped your pants in front of me.

320
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,548
It's one of the nasty
side effects of dying.

321
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,297
Last Saturday I got in a car crash.

322
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,595
A drunk driver came over
the line and hit me, head on.

323
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,031
It was like slow motion.

324
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,642
I saw these headlights,

325
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,077
then,

326
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,443
I saw...

327
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:30,878
Paramedics said I was
technically dead for 97 seconds.

328
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:38,591
It was the best 97 seconds of my life.

329
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,466
Okay, here's what happened.

330
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,667
Your oxygen-deprived
brain was shutting down.

331
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,502
A flood of endorphins and
serotonin was released.

332
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,172
That's what gave you the visions.

333
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:59,580
No. Believe me. It wasn't chemicals.

334
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,453
I've done every hallucinogenic there is.

335
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,489
This was way bigger than that.

336
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,825
There's something out there.

337
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,725
Something more.

338
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,237
Hey, can I have my knife back?

339
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,329
Nope.

340
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,367
Who the hell isn't a doctor?

341
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,776
House said we can't talk.

342
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,177
He meant we can't talk about the case.

343
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,943
House is just jerking us around.

344
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,415
That's what he does.

345
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,883
You're not curious.

346
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,749
Only one reason you wouldn't be curious.

347
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,255
We should talk about the case.

348
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,949
He's punishing us for wasting time.

349
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,549
Maybe we shouldn't be wasting this time.

350
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,685
Close that door.

351
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:43,785
You're going to get us all fired.

352
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,423
We need to find a link between
fainting and trouble swallowing.

353
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,764
We need to know if it's
dysphagia or full-blown achalasia.

354
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,097
Paraganglioma.

355
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,900
How would a neo-plastic growth
in his abdomen explain...

356
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,338
Not his abdomen. In his neck.

357
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,672
A carotid body tumor
causes trouble swallowing.

358
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,043
Food presses against the vagus
nerve and causes the fainting.

359
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,981
So, if this guy has cancer,
we get to keep our jobs.

360
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,108
If he's healthy, we're fired.

361
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,413
We need a CT to prove it.

362
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,818
And we need the women not to figure
it out while we're sitting here.

363
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,289
And does House's computer
have a built-in microphone?

364
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:43,646
There is a potential toxicity
with an experimental treatment.

365
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,885
I was never here.

366
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,492
Blood pressure is remaining
stable through 60 degrees.

367
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,158
No pauses on his EKG, no nausea.

368
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,895
Our treatment worked.

369
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,266
I need our patient.

370
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,396
Syncope's cured, Amber. It's over.

371
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,733
You obviously haven't stressed
his system hard enough.

372
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,778
You crank it up high
enough, anyone will pass out.

373
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,440
This is incredible!

374
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,076
This is the most I've moved in 20 years.

375
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,112
The tilt table test showed
that the patient's EKG,

376
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,714
BP and pulse remained normal, despite...

377
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,554
Who are you, Thirteen?

378
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,458
My name's in the file.

379
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,053
The fact that you won't
answer my questions

380
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,859
tells me more about
you than answers could.

381
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:27,990
No, it doesn't.

382
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,090
We turned the thing up to 95 degrees...

383
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,466
You don't think that
non-answers tell me anything?

384
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,095
Sure. Just not as
much as actual answers.

385
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,400
That's why they're called answers.

386
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,735
They tell me you're hiding something.

387
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,035
Tells you I'm hiding everything.

388
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,940
Tells me you've got
something worth hiding.

389
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,002
Was it Turkish prison? Gay porn?

390
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,274
You killed a man just 'cause he
was asking too many questions?

391
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,906
Can I finish reporting on the patient?

392
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,109
No need.

393
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,652
See you in an hour or so.

394
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,482
Got to set some stuff up.

395
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,890
Thank you all for
coming to tribal council.

396
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:03,390
A man of your integrity, I
feel I can trust, Big Love.

397
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,835
And I don't call you that
'cause you're a Mormon.

398
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,600
Where's your team's sixth man?

399
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,437
She went rogue. Broke the rules.

400
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,339
You also sinned. You have no
right to cast the first stone.

401
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,175
And atheists have no
right to quote scripture.

402
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,544
The rules said, "No talking. "

403
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,673
I told them not to talk.

404
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,738
Out loud.

405
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,409
We were trying to save a man's life.

406
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,112
Key word being "trying".

407
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,782
Tilt table test confirmed
that you guys were wrong.

408
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,085
You're fired.

409
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,022
The prodigal son returneth.

410
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,325
You're also fired.

411
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,889
We thought there was a tumor
on the patient's esophagus.

412
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,436
We were right about the area,
wrong about the diagnosis.

413
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,802
Turns out the esophagus is just
straightening. It's scleroderma.

414
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,238
Explains the syncope and the choking.

415
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,366
He needs steroids.

416
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,138
You did a CT scan? Obviously.

417
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,974
After you were already proven wrong?

418
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,513
Good for you.

419
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,243
It's too bad you're wrong.

420
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,547
Straightening indicates
weakening, not hardening.

421
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,111
SMA explains the weakening.

422
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,986
Strongyloides infection
explains everything else.

423
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,550
You ladies have the honor to
give the patient a feeding tube.

424
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,722
Discharge him. Show
up for work tomorrow.

425
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:09,426
The rest of you...
You're a disappointment.

426
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,231
You make me want to stop dangling.

427
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,008
It was the best two weeks of my life.

428
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:28,018
I think I will miss you most
of all, Ridiculously Old Fraud.

429
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,952
Do you think House could be wrong?

430
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,123
I thought he fired you.

431
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,756
No. He fired the men.

432
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,768
I don't think he's wrong.

433
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,102
If he is, how would I prove it?

434
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,802
I just said I don't think he is.

435
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,539
Well, thinking isn't good enough.

436
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,513
You have to run a blood test
for anticentromere antibodies.

437
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,049
Would you mind running the labs?

438
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,141
You can't.

439
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,344
Well, I can, but...

440
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,320
No, I was making a statement.

441
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,446
You've been fired.

442
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,150
So, you no longer have lab privileges.

443
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,316
You weren't coming here for advice.

444
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,054
You were coming here to con
a favor to save your job.

445
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,460
Sorry. I'm not working for him anymore,

446
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,624
but he can still make my life miserable.

447
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,364
And you have a chance to
make his life miserable.

448
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,173
I'm insulted.

449
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,972
You conned Cameron by
appealing to her humanity...

450
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,512
I told her what she wanted to hear.

451
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,377
And you told me what you
thought I wanted to hear.

452
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,941
If it's any consolation, I think
your motives are more interesting.

453
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,749
I cannot believe he fired you.

454
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,319
Go draw his blood.

455
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,257
I'll meet you in the
lab when I'm done here.

456
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,669
Guess you didn't find your tumor.

457
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,898
The other doctors tell
you that you were fine?

458
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,736
Yeah, in the sense it's just
my disease getting worse.

459
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,742
You come to terms with this disease.

460
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:08,577
You know it's there.
You know it's waiting.

461
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:12,054
And every now and again
it takes something away.

462
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,059
Took my walking. Took my modesty.

463
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,431
Now, it's taking one
of my last pleasures.

464
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,596
Well, there's an outside shot

465
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,068
that something other than the SMA

466
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,765
is causing your eating problems.

467
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,297
And if it is, we can
fix it, remove that tube.

468
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:42,014
Is that my blood? It's green.

469
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,155
What does that mean?

470
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,758
It means I'm not fired.

471
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,127
Is he a Vulcan?

472
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,733
If no, what makes Nimoy bleed green?

473
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,033
Are we officially un-fired?

474
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,097
How do we know she didn't
fake the green blood?

475
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,869
'Cause that would be stupid.

476
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,401
And while she may be manipulative,
borderline evil, shallow...

477
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,539
They get it. I'm not stupid.

478
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,877
What contrast did you use for the CT?

479
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,008
ICM.

480
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,244
His kidneys aren't working.

481
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,085
They didn't filter the contrast,
which, in ICM, is green.

482
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,383
Ten points.

483
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,859
Okay, let's add kidney failure
to our list of symptoms.

484
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,453
What are these points? Is that
how you're deciding who to fire?

485
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,089
I'm going to fire the next person
who asks me who I'm going to fire.

486
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,224
Now we're on the point system?

487
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,325
What happened to men against women?

488
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,459
Forget the game.

489
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:32,560
What do you mean, forget the game?

490
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,537
I mean, forget the damn game!

491
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:35,698
This guy's kidneys are failing.

492
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,071
We need to diagnose exactly...

493
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,404
I thought we were diagnosing.

494
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,002
You were diagnosing. Now, I am, too.

495
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:44,172
I thought that Thirteen was
right about the strongyloides.

496
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,443
I was obviously wrong.

497
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,481
Okay, kidney failure,
aspiration, fainting. Go.

498
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,250
Kidney failure could be the
result of a gram negative bacteria.

499
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,258
Our patient wears a catheter full-time.

500
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,191
It virtually guarantees
bacterial infection.

501
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,592
Which could have migrated
up to his kidneys.

502
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:02,463
Infection stresses his already
weakened system, makes his SMA worse.

503
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,434
That explains the choking and fainting.

504
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,970
Put him on an IV amp and gent.

505
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,096
Our team's scleroderma
diagnosis still holds.

506
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,663
The test could have
been negative because

507
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,072
the blood was tainted with the contrast.

508
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,575
Do a skin biopsy.

509
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,612
Get a side of lymph node to confirm.

510
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,544
I could have you fired.

511
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,383
You already had me fired.

512
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,617
Just proves that I can.

513
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,749
Were the men wrong?

514
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:28,884
No.

515
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,894
That doesn't change the fact...
Why are you yelling at me?

516
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,327
Because performing tests for someone

517
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:33,762
who is not a doctor in this hospital...

518
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,096
You're frustrated. You
want help, I'm here.

519
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,863
If you just need to
vent, leave a message.

520
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,504
I like him better like this. You?

521
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,544
Patient developed pneumonia.

522
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,773
His lungs are filling fast.

523
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,281
We started him on antibiotics.

524
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,611
Nothing. We were wrong.

525
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,673
And you're here to say?

526
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:54,776
We were wrong, too.

527
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,320
He doesn't have scleroderma.

528
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,980
Biopsy revealed no fibrotic changes.

529
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,956
Cervical lymph node has black flecks.

530
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,016
Just small areas of
necrosis. It's nothing.

531
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,220
You say, "Nothing," I say, "Cancer. "

532
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,494
It's a bit of a stretch
to jump right to cancer.

533
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,623
I'm not jumping.

534
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,496
Broad specs haven't worked,
so it's not bacterial.

535
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,162
Failing liver despite treatment
suggests it's not fungal.

536
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,102
And her high lactic
acidosis points towards

537
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,106
anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

538
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:19,903
Also suggests infection, which is
a lot easier and safer to treat.

539
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,946
Large cell lymphoma is
incredibly aggressive.

540
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,015
She'll be dead in a week
if we follow the textbooks.

541
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,050
Unless it's infection, in
which case you irradiate her,

542
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,914
and she'll be dead in a day.

543
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,749
And I know you have some
experience with that.

544
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,924
I've seen doctors do this before.

545
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,357
Go back to the scene of the crime,

546
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,861
if you're right this time, you
purge yourself of past ghosts.

547
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,521
I know it's contrary to protocol.

548
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,225
But I think it's more likely...

549
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,267
Ghosts are there for a reason.

550
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,599
So you don't make the
same mistake twice.

551
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:50,274
Switch her over to
third-generation cephalosporin.

552
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,608
You want to remove his eye?

553
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,842
Who told you?

554
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,475
You booked the OR.

555
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,610
Good.

556
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,985
You can't beat me in a foot race.

557
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,047
I thought we were dancing.

558
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,088
Cervical lymph node is a garbage dump.

559
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,186
A very small one.

560
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,493
Just one truck comes and
it only comes from one home.

561
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,328
Al Gore would be appalled. The home...

562
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,426
The home is the right eye. I get it.

563
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,394
Do a biopsy.

564
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,803
On my way.

565
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,932
You're not doing a biopsy.

566
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,636
You ordered an orbital exenteration.

567
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,803
Right. Because I don't want
to remove a little, tiny piece,

568
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,608
sit in the lab and confirm
what I already know,

569
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,615
while my patient
drowns in his own fluid.

570
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,550
But if you want me
to, I absolutely will.

571
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,280
How advanced is the pneumonia?

572
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,413
It's taking college courses.

573
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,082
Hey, Wilson!

574
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,887
I'm going to cut some cripple's eye out!

575
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,894
Want to come watch?

576
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:46,657
Good times.

577
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:47,891
We good to go?

578
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,070
I thought melanoma was skin cancer.

579
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,610
Technically, it's cancer
of the pigment cells.

580
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,709
The same cells that
give your iris its color.

581
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,184
Cancer?

582
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,746
Why not? What else can God throw at me?

583
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,520
Hail, locusts, smiting
of the first born...

584
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,494
All depends on how evil you've been.

585
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,825
House.

586
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,496
If it's cancer, it's
spread everywhere, right?

587
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,395
That's what's in my lungs? My kidneys?

588
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,997
There is a chance, by removing
the eye, to get the primary tumor,

589
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,509
and three courses of radiation,

590
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:33,935
that could...

591
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,446
Could what? A few months? Years?

592
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,278
More likely months.

593
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:45,186
Any of your other doctors
have any cheerier diagnoses?

594
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,247
If they do, they're
wrong. This is the answer.

595
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,293
It's the only way to help you.

596
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,261
I already can't walk. I can't eat.

597
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,966
You're telling me that
the rest of my life

598
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,369
is in this bed, puking and pain?

599
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,866
We can manage the pain.

600
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,604
I'd rather just get this over with.

601
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:13,316
I've been trapped in this
useless body long enough.

602
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,445
It'd be nice to finally get out.

603
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:21,754
Get out and go where?

604
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,259
I mean, you think you're
going to sprout wings

605
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,057
and start flying around
with the other angels?

606
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,324
Don't be an idiot.

607
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,989
There is no "after". There's just this.

608
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,260
House!

609
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,546
You can't let a dying man
take solace in his beliefs?

610
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,741
His beliefs are stupid.

611
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,078
Everybody lies.

612
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,778
Some for good reasons, some for bad.

613
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,513
This would have been a
fantastic reason to lie.

614
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,214
Hi. Greg House.

615
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,349
Why can't you just let
him have his fairy tale?

616
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,324
If it gives him comfort
to imagine beaches

617
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,793
and loved ones and life
outside a wheelchair...

618
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,353
Are there 72 virgins, too?

619
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,557
It's over.

620
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,863
He's got days, maybe hours left.

621
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,869
What pain does it cause you if he
spends that time with a peaceful smile?

622
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,598
What sick pleasure do you get in making

623
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,903
damn sure he's filled
with fear and dread?

624
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,876
He shouldn't be making a
decision based on a lie.

625
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,105
Misery is better than nothing.

626
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,171
You don't know there's
nothing. You haven't been there.

627
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,646
Oh, God, I am tired of that argument.

628
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,117
I don't have to go to Detroit
to know that it smells.

629
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:25,816
Yes. Detroit, the afterlife, same thing.

630
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,651
You're not getting enough oxygen,

631
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,155
so we're inserting a tube
directly into your lungs.

632
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,418
It should help us drain
some of this excess fluid.

633
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,757
Should make you a
little more comfortable.

634
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,468
SATs are still dropping.

635
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:19,696
The fluid's clear.

636
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,705
If this was cancer,
there should be blood.

637
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,274
Call House.

638
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,171
He just paged me.

639
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,184
Dr. House!

640
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,791
Maybe it was

641
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,967
just an accident.

642
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,032
It wasn't an accident.

643
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,870
Think his nihilism got the best of
him and he tried to kill himself?

644
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,569
He paged me. He paged you?

645
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,236
Why you? I assume because...

646
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,338
Don't assume anything.

647
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,874
Don't fall into that trap.

648
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,418
Is he okay?

649
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,116
Burned his hand pretty good.

650
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,248
His heart stopped for nearly a minute.

651
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,191
But your cohort managed to restart it.

652
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,593
But he has not regained consciousness.

653
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,668
So, since I have you all here,

654
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,170
we should probably talk
about your actual patient.

655
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:30,139
Clear fluid from the lungs indicates
that it's probably not cancer.

656
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,871
So it would be nice if we
could come up with a new idea.

657
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,882
You're an idiot. You
nearly killed yourself.

658
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:46,981
That was the whole idea.

659
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,047
You wanted to kill yourself?

660
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,458
I wanted to nearly kill myself.

661
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,858
Is he better?

662
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:52,953
No.

663
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,157
But he doesn't have cancer.

664
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,063
We think it might be
eosinophilic pneumonia.

665
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,069
Maybe you didn't want to die,
but you didn't care if you lived.

666
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,265
You insisted that I
needed to see for myself.

667
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,598
Was he discharged?

668
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,040
No. He's dying.

669
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,377
You've already had two
near-death experiences.

670
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,974
Not that guy, the guy
in the car accident.

671
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,541
With the knife.

672
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,216
I need to talk to him.

673
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,450
He died almost an hour ago.

674
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,754
Apparently, it's bad
to electrocute yourself

675
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:27,320
within days of suffering
massive internal injuries.

676
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,261
Why did you need to talk to him?

677
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,735
Did you see something?

678
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,967
Eosinophilic pneumonia.

679
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,372
House? What did you see?

680
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,705
Nothing.

681
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,142
Whose idea was that?

682
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,372
Brennan.

683
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,348
"Nothing," you don't want to
talk about it, or, "Nothing... "

684
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,008
Which one's Brennan?

685
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,609
Is he the ridiculously old guy?

686
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,551
House, you've got to talk about this.

687
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:54,819
If it's aggressive enough it might
have gotten past the steroids.

688
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,052
Start him on cyclophosphamide.

689
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,652
I already did.

690
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,355
Just looking at you hurts.

691
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,659
I'm gonna order up some extra pain meds.

692
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,202
I love you.

693
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:14,433
How fast will this work?

694
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,106
New meds should start helping
in minutes, okay? Hang in there.

695
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,048
Vacutainer's full. I need to replace it.

696
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:24,554
I don't think it's working.

697
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,179
Try and relax.

698
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,149
You must be wrong.

699
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,695
Stop talking.

700
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,455
Hurry up and get the chest tube working.

701
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,125
Okay. I got it.

702
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,602
Can you get Hoover?

703
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,022
I can't...

704
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,824
Can you put my

705
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:07,990
hand

706
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,865
on his head?

707
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,537
It's okay. Don't worry.

708
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,709
I'm not scared.

709
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,192
Oh, God.

710
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,471
Time of death...

711
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,889
You're looking better.

712
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,948
Stark's dead.

713
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,356
What are you doing?

714
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,058
Going to see our patient.

715
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,795
He's dead.

716
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,929
"Dead" is not a diagnosis.

717
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,303
You really shouldn't be...

718
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,238
Shut up and give me my cane.

719
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,236
I assume we're all fired.

720
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,042
Should I fire myself, too?

721
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,814
I thought it was strongyloides,
then I thought it was cancer.

722
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,352
A little help, here?

723
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,920
Ready? One, two...

724
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,261
Why did you call me?

725
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,093
Because if I pooped
myself in front of Wilson,

726
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:49,189
I'd never hear the end of it.

727
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,995
But why not one of the others?

728
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,364
You always have that phone in your hand.

729
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,132
We all have cell phones,
that's not the reason. What is?

730
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,538
If I died, you'd never get the job.

731
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,371
I knew you wouldn't let that happen.

732
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,911
You don't think anybody
else has any reason to care?

733
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,503
I think this is starting
to come back to me.

734
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,912
It's right, left, then repeat.

735
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,680
Yeah. That works.

736
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,314
What did we miss?

737
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,881
If we knew, he wouldn't be dead.

738
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,154
So, that's it? You're
just gonna give up?

739
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,695
No. We were defeated. It's over.

740
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,262
Patient presented with syncope.

741
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,802
We thought it was thread
worms, gave him ivermectin.

742
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,861
Thank you.

743
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,999
The patient seemed better
until his blood turned green.

744
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,633
Can we at least remove the body before

745
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,043
launching into a purely
academic exercise?

746
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,276
The patient didn't respond
to antibiotics or steroids.

747
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,442
You okay, boy?

748
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,679
What's wrong with the dog?

749
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,523
He's dead.

750
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,564
There are only a handful of viruses

751
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,657
that can cross between dogs and humans.

752
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,725
But they may not be connected at all.

753
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,633
The dog was old. I've seen it before.

754
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,798
They hang on way past
their normal life expectancy

755
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,306
to take care of their masters.

756
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,741
Did you watch him take the pills?

757
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,871
The ivermectin. Did
you watch the patient

758
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,745
put them in his mouth and swallow them?

759
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,682
I don't know. I think so.

760
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:15,776
What kind of dog is that?

761
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,842
English Shepherd.

762
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,047
That's in the collie family, right?

763
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,180
Not really.

764
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,450
But they share the MDR-1 gene?

765
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,684
Yeah.

766
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,752
What happens when you give a dog
with the MDR-1 gene ivermectin?

767
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:26,887
They don't.

768
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,158
I mean, it's used to treat
heartworms in most dogs,

769
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,701
but it would be fatal if they...

770
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,001
Look familiar?

771
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,279
I think the last time you saw it,

772
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,747
it didn't have that dead
dog's teeth marks on it.

773
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,011
I just put it on the bed
tray to get him some water.

774
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,111
When I asked you if you watched
the patient swallow the pills,

775
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,383
the right answer was, "No. "

776
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,418
Take his body down to the morgue.

777
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,802
If you hadn't treated this patient
as a game, he wouldn't be dead.

778
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,641
Feeling much better, thank you.

779
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,307
I'm supposed to show you sympathy?

780
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:23,613
He died while his attending
was lying on a hospital bed

781
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,315
because he stuck a
knife in a wall socket.

782
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,325
He died because a doctor made a mistake.

783
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:30,816
She was an idiot.

784
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,157
You employed her.

785
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,961
You're responsible.

786
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,245
Dr. Foreman.

787
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,712
How's she doing?

788
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:58,048
Fever's gone. AST and ALT
are back within normal range.

789
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,184
She should be out of here in a few days.

790
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,418
Gutsy call.

791
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,482
Thanks.

792
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,993
It wasn't a compliment.

793
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,557
If you were wrong, she'd be dead.

794
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,655
I was sure...

795
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,427
No, you weren't. You couldn't be.

796
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,763
There's a reason we have rules.

797
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,304
If every doctor did whatever
his gut told him was right,

798
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,568
we'd have a lot more
dead bodies to deal with.

799
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,199
It won't happen again.

800
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,675
Yes, it will.

801
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,941
Because you confuse saving her
life with doing the right thing.

802
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,645
I'm sorry, Dr. Foreman, you're fired.

803
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,964
As soon as the pathologist
cut into the lungs,

804
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,134
we saw the threadworms.

805
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,004
Do you think it's fair that I fired

806
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,481
all the other members of your team

807
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,519
when you guys actually came
up with the right diagnosis?

808
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:07,154
I keep replaying it in my mind.

809
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:10,057
Did I drop the pills when
I put them on the bed tray?

810
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,323
Did I knock them over
when I turned to leave?

811
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,691
You know, he'd be alive.

812
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,731
His dog would be alive.

813
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:21,998
I know.

814
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,406
You forced us to act
on a false assumption.

815
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,500
I know.

816
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:30,035
Everything we built from that step on,

817
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,082
every test, every
theory, every treatment...

818
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:35,346
I know. Forget the lecture
and fire me already.

819
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:41,491
If I was gonna fire you, I
wouldn't be giving you the lecture.

820
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:48,859
I know you're not gonna let
anything like this ever happen again.

821
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,937
I'll see you tomorrow.

822
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,945
I'm sorry to say,

823
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,077
I told you so.
