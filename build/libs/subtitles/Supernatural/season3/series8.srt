1
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:17,585
- Merry Christmas, Grandpa.
- Oh, Merry Christmas to you, Stevey.

2
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:20,427
Did you bring me any presents?

3
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:22,089
Now, why would I wanna do that?

4
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:23,508
Because it's Christmas.

5
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:27,809
Oh. I thought Santa Claus
brought the presents at Christmas.

6
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:30,016
You have been a good boy this year?

7
00:00:30,187 --> 00:00:31,350
I have, I swear.

8
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:34,013
Well, then. Who knows?
Maybe he'll come.

9
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:11,556
Santa.

10
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:21,822
Reindeer.

11
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,033
Santa?

12
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:29,131
My daughter and I were in our beds.

13
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,094
Mike was downstairs
decorating the tree.

14
00:02:32,604 --> 00:02:36,732
And I heard a thump on the roof
and then I heard Mike scream...

15
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:39,690
...and now I'm talking to the FBI.

16
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:41,189
You didn't see any of it?

17
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,271
No, he was...

18
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:44,562
He was just gone.

19
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:47,654
- The doors were locked, no forced entry?
- That's right.

20
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:49,985
- Does anybody else have a key?
- My parents.

21
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:52,286
- Where do they live?
- Florida.

22
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:54,284
Thanks for letting me have a look.

23
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,997
I think we got just about
everything we need.

24
00:02:57,503 --> 00:02:59,046
We're all set.

25
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,293
We'll be in touch.

26
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,927
Agents.

27
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,011
The police said my husband
might've been kidnapped.

28
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,100
Could be.

29
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:14,142
Then why haven't
the kidnappers called?

30
00:03:14,312 --> 00:03:16,389
Or demanded a ransom?

31
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:18,973
It's three days until Christmas.

32
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,191
What am I supposed to tell
our daughter?

33
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:23,148
We're very sorry.

34
00:03:31,872 --> 00:03:32,903
Find anything?

35
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:36,415
Stockings, mistletoe, this.

36
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:37,914
A tooth? Where was this?

37
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,838
In the chimney.
- No way a man fits up a chimney...

38
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:43,497
...it's too narrow.
- No way he fits up in one piece.

39
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:45,336
So if dad went up the chimney...

40
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:48,084
We need to find out
what dragged him up there.

41
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,605
So was I right?

42
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:00,348
Is it the serial killing chimney sweep?

43
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:03,942
Yup, it's actually Dick Van Dyke.

44
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:05,905
<i>- Who?
- Mary Poppins...</i>

45
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:08,066
- Who's that?
- Oh, come on... Engh. Never mind.

46
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:11,947
Walsh is the second guy
grabbed out of his house this month.

47
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:13,152
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,122
Did he get dragged up
the chimney too?

49
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,410
Don't know. Witnesses said they heard
a thump on the roof.

50
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:20,206
What are we dealing with?

51
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:22,502
- Actually, I have an idea.
- Yeah?

52
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:24,215
It's gonna sound crazy.

53
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:27,337
What could you possibly say
that sounds crazy to me?

54
00:04:27,553 --> 00:04:30,470
Um... Evil Santa.

55
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:33,973
- Yeah, that's crazy.
- Yeah.

56
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:38,806
I'm just saying that there's some version
of the Anti-Claus in every culture.

57
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:41,520
You got Belsnickel,
Krampus, Black Peter.

58
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:44,314
- Whatever you wanna call it.
- Saying what?

59
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:46,978
Saying, back in the day,
Santa's brother went rogue.

60
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:50,573
Now he shows up around Christmas,
but instead he punishes the wicked.

61
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:53,495
- By hauling their ass up chimneys?
- For starters, yeah.

62
00:04:53,663 --> 00:04:56,450
So this is your theory, huh?
Santa's shady brother?

63
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:59,412
Well, I... Just saying,
that's what the lore says.

64
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:01,875
Santa doesn't have a brother.
There is no Santa.

65
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:05,665
Yeah, I know. You're the one who told
me that in the first place, remember?

66
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:13,380
Yeah, you know what,
I could be wrong, I...

67
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:15,972
Gotta be wrong.

68
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:17,887
Maybe, maybe not.

69
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:20,554
- What?
- I did a little digging.

70
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:22,559
Both victims visited the same place...

71
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:24,810
...before they got snatched.
- Where?

72
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:32,649
Hurry up. Ha-ha.

73
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:34,571
Hurry.

74
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,581
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:39,955
It does kind of lend credence
to the theory.

76
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:43,495
Yeah, but Anti-Claus? Couldn't be.

77
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:47,716
It's a Christmas miracle. Speaking of,
we should have one this year.

78
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,919
- Have one what?
- A Christmas.

79
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:52,634
- Ha. No, thanks.
- No, we'll get a tree...

80
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:55,724
...a little Boston Market,
just like when we were little.

81
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:58,384
Dean, those weren't exactly
Hallmark memories for me.

82
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:00,604
We had some great Christmases.

83
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:03,346
- Who's childhood are you talking about?
- Come on, Sam.

84
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:05,435
No, just...

85
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:06,774
No.

86
00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:10,523
All right, grinch.

87
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:31,171
What is that?

88
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:33,217
Present for dad.

89
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:37,009
Yeah, right. Where did you
get the money? Steal it?

90
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:39,806
No. Uncle Bobby gave it to me
to give to him.

91
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,390
Said it was real special.

92
00:06:41,564 --> 00:06:42,643
What is it?

93
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:44,982
- A pony.
- Heh.

94
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,144
Very funny.

95
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:52,991
Dad's gonna be here, right?

96
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,150
- He'll be here.
- But it's Christmas.

97
00:06:56,662 --> 00:06:57,693
He knows.

98
00:06:57,872 --> 00:06:59,698
And he'll be here. Promise.

99
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:02,329
- Where is he anyway?
- On business.

100
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:05,123
- What kind of business?
- You know that.

101
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,873
- He sells stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

102
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,295
Stuff.

103
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:11,092
Nobody ever tells me anything.

104
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:14,427
Then quit asking.

105
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,602
Is dad a spy?

106
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:27,522
- Mm-hm. He's James Bond.
- Why do we move around so much?

107
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:31,229
Because everywhere we go,
they get sick of your face.

108
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:36,573
I'm old enough, Dean.
You can tell me the truth.

109
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:39,995
You don't wanna know the truth.
Believe me.

110
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:42,917
Is that why we never talk about mom?

111
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:47,083
Shut up!
Don't you ever talk about mom, ever!

112
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,342
Wait, where are you going?

113
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:54,135
Out.

114
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:05,685
You'd think for the 10 bucks
it costs to get in...

115
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:08,064
...Santa could scrounge up
a little snow.

116
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:11,529
What?

117
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:14,574
Nothing.
What are we looking for again?

118
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,367
Um...

119
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:21,362
Lore says that the Anti-Claus
will walk with a limp...

120
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,947
...and smell like sweets.

121
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:27,959
Great, so we're looking for
a pimp Santa. Why the sweets?

122
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:32,128
Think about it. If you smell like candy,
the kids will come closer, you know?

123
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:35,134
- That's creepy.
- Heh.

124
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:38,513
How does this thing know who's been
naughty and who's been nice?

125
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:40,423
I don't know.

126
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:45,599
So, Ronny, come sit on Santa's knee.
Augh.

127
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:47,102
There you go.

128
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:49,647
- You've been a good boy this year?
Yeah.

129
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:51,194
Good.

130
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:53,983
Santa's got a special gift for you.

131
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:57,941
Maybe we do.

132
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,151
Come on, honey.

133
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:01,610
- All right.
- Let's go.

134
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:05,165
Welcome to Santa's Court.
Can I escort your child to Santa?

135
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:07,163
No, no.

136
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:10,752
But actually, my brother here,
it's been a lifelong dream of his.

137
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:16,251
- Sorry. No kids over 12.
- No, he's just kidding.

138
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:17,923
We only came here to watch.

139
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:23,011
Ew.

140
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,220
I didn't mean that we came here to... Y...

141
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:29,815
Thanks a lot, Dean. Thanks for that.

142
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,563
Check it out.

143
00:09:38,618 --> 00:09:40,527
It's all right.

144
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:45,286
Are you seeing this?

145
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:47,376
A lot of people walk with limps.

146
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:52,420
- You didn't smell that? That was candy.
- That was ripple. I think. Had to be.

147
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:56,675
Maybe.
We willing to take that chance?

148
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:02,509
What time is it?

149
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,843
Same as the last time you asked.

150
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,473
Here.

151
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,190
Caffeinate.

152
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,480
Wonderful.

153
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:24,246
Hey, Sam.

154
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:25,952
Yeah?

155
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,498
Why are you the boy
that hates Christmas?

156
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,039
- Dean.
- I mean, I admit it.

157
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,371
We had a few bumpy holidays
when we were kids.

158
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,043
- Bumpy?
- But that was then.

159
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,592
We'll do it right this year.

160
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:40,387
Look, Dean, if you wanna
have Christmas, knock yourself out.

161
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,216
Just don't involve me.

162
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:48,102
Oh, yeah. That would be great.
Me and myself making cranberry molds.

163
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,323
What's up with Saint Nicotine?

164
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,208
Oh, my God!

165
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,342
Ha.

166
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,212
- What?
- Nothing.

167
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,550
It's just that...

168
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:24,850
Well, you know, Mr. Gung-Ho Christmas
might have to blow away Santa.

169
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,315
The hell you doing here, huh?

170
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,650
<i>I'm really not interested, okay?</i>

171
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,196
<i>Mistle my toe.</i>

172
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,902
<i>Roast my chestnut.</i>

173
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:42,069
L...

174
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,698
<i>Jingle my bell.</i>

175
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,098
Let's go.

176
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:38,004
Santa, you're early.

177
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:16,936
So that's how your son
described the attack?

178
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,852
Santa took daddy up the chimney?

179
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:20,901
That's what he says, yes.

180
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,110
- And where were you?
- I was asleep.

181
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:29,079
And all of a sudden, Al was being
dragged out of bed, screaming.

182
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:30,740
Did you see the attacker?

183
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:34,781
It was dark and he hit me.

184
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,039
He knocked me out.

185
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:38,623
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

186
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,375
Yeah. Uh...

187
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:45,302
Mrs. Caldwell, where did you get
that wreath above the fireplace?

188
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:52,596
Excuse me?

189
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:59,189
Just curious, you know?

190
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:05,483
Wreaths, huh? Sure you didn't
wanna ask her about her shoes?

191
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,651
I saw some nice handbags
in the foyer.

192
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:09,985
- We've seen that wreath before, Dean.
- Where?

193
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:13,199
The Walsh's. Yesterday.

194
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:15,331
I know. I was just testing you.

195
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:20,588
Yeah. All right.

196
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:22,998
Well, keep looking, would you?

197
00:15:23,175 --> 00:15:24,504
Thanks, Bobby.

198
00:15:24,677 --> 00:15:28,509
Well, we're not dealing
with the Anti-Claus.

199
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:29,796
What did Bobby say?

200
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:31,756
That we're morons.

201
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:35,886
He also said that it was probably
meadowsweet in those wreaths.

202
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:39,766
Wow. Amazing.
What the hell is meadowsweet?

203
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:43,145
It's pretty rare and it's the most
powerful plant in pagan lore.

204
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:45,314
- Pagan lore?
- Yeah.

205
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:48,029
They'd use meadowsweet
for human sacrifices.

206
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,407
It was kind of like a chum
for their gods.

207
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:54,077
Gods were drawn to it, they'd stop by
and snack on the nearest human.

208
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:56,704
Why would somebody use that
for Christmas wreaths?

209
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:59,001
It's not so crazy as it sounds, Dean.

210
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,412
Pretty much every
Christmas tradition is pagan.

211
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,333
Christmas is Jesus' birthday.

212
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:08,170
Jesus' birthday was probably in the fall.
It was the winter solstice festival...

213
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:10,587
...that was co-opted by the Church
and renamed.

214
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:14,300
The yule log, Santa's red suit,
that's all remnants of pagan worship.

215
00:16:14,478 --> 00:16:16,221
How do you know that?

216
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:19,563
What will you tell me next?
Easter bunny's Jewish?

217
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:22,894
Think we're dealing with a pagan god?

218
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,027
Yeah, probably Holdenacar...

219
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:27,522
...god of the winter solstice.

220
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,199
And all these Martha Stewart wannabes
buying these fancy wreaths.

221
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:35,288
Yup, it's like putting a neon sign
on your front door saying:

222
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:37,663
- "Come kill us. "
- Great.

223
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:39,831
Huh.

224
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:42,790
When you sacrifice to Holdenacar,
guess what he gives you?

225
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,502
- Lap dances, hopefully.
- Mild weather.

226
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,925
Like no snow in the middle
of December in Michigan.

227
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:53,090
- For instance.
- Do we know how to kill it?

228
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:54,809
No, Bobby's working on that now.

229
00:16:54,977 --> 00:16:57,812
We gotta figure out
where they're selling those wreaths.

230
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,604
They're selling them on purpose?

231
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:02,015
Feeding the victims to this thing?

232
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:04,766
Let's find out.

233
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:16,866
- Can I help you, boys?
- I hope so.

234
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,243
We were playing Jenga over
at the Walsh's the other night and...

235
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,874
Well, he hasn't shut up since
about this wreath.

236
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:26,000
- I don't know. You tell him.
- Sure.

237
00:17:27,843 --> 00:17:29,337
It was yummy.

238
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:35,716
I sell a lot of wreaths, guys.

239
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:39,476
Right, right, but you see,
this one would have been really special.

240
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:43,941
It had... It had green leaves,
white buds on it.

241
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,316
Might have been made
of meadowsweet?

242
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,978
Well, aren't you a fussy one?

243
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:50,485
N...

244
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:52,485
He is. Heh-heh.

245
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,946
Anyway, I know the one
you're talking about. I'm all out.

246
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:58,909
Huh. Seems like this meadowsweet
stuff's rare and expensive.

247
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,408
- Why make wreaths out of it?
- I didn't make them.

248
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,995
- Who did?
- Madge Carrigan, a local lady.

249
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:06,841
Said they were so special,
she gave them to me for free.

250
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:08,835
- She didn't charge you.
- Nope.

251
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,837
- Sell them for free?
- It's Christmas...

252
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:14,547
...people pay a butt-load for this crap.
- That's the spirit.

253
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:20,770
How much do you think
a meadowsweet wreath would cost?

254
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:24,723
- Couple hundred dollars, at least.
- This lady's giving them away for free?

255
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:26,311
What do you think about that?

256
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:29,652
Well, I'd say it's pretty suspicious.

257
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:34,658
Remember that wreath
Dad brought home that one year?

258
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:39,449
You mean, the one he stole from,
like, a liquor store?

259
00:18:39,624 --> 00:18:42,162
Yeah, it was a bunch
of empty beer cans.

260
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,043
That thing was great.

261
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:48,257
I bet if I looked around hard enough,
I could probably find one just like it.

262
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:49,884
All right.

263
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:53,885
- Dude, what's going on with you?
- What?

264
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:58,433
Since when are you Bing Crosby?
Why do you wanna do Christmas so bad?

265
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:02,227
Why are you so against it? Were your
childhood memories that traumatic?

266
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:04,474
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Then what?

267
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,651
I mean, I just... I don't get it.

268
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,690
You haven't talked about Christmas
in years.

269
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:14,106
Well, yeah.

270
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:16,984
This is my last year.

271
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:26,295
I know.

272
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:29,757
That's why I can't.

273
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:33,635
What do you mean?

274
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,385
I mean, I can't just sit around
drinking eggnog...

275
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:43,969
...pretending everything's okay...

276
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:47,065
...when I know next Christmas
you'll be dead.

277
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:53,564
I just can't.

278
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:11,838
- Thought you went out?
- Yeah, and I got you dinner.

279
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:15,129
Don't forget your vegetables.

280
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,644
I know why you keep a gun
under your pillow.

281
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,191
No, you don't.

282
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:33,608
Stay out of my stuff.

283
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,357
And I know why we lay salt down
everywhere we go.

284
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:39,025
No, you don't. Shut up.

285
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,918
Where did you get that? That's dad's.

286
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:50,164
He's gonna kick your ass
for reading that.

287
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,667
- Are monsters real?
- What?

288
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:54,716
- You're crazy.
- Tell me.

289
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:11,146
I swear, if you ever tell dad
I told you any of this, I will end you.

290
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,778
Promise.

291
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:25,914
First thing you have to know is
we have the coolest dad in the world.

292
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,625
- He's a superhero.
- He is?

293
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:30,290
Yeah.

294
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,204
Monsters are real.

295
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:35,425
Dad fights them.

296
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,219
He's fighting them right now.

297
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:40,140
But dad said the monsters under my bed
weren't real.

298
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:44,471
That's because he'd already checked
under there.

299
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:47,016
But, yeah, they're real.

300
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:49,555
Almost everything's real.

301
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:52,060
Is Santa real?

302
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,517
No.

303
00:21:57,366 --> 00:22:00,901
If monsters are real, then they
could get us. They could get me.

304
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:03,996
- Dad's not gonna let them get you.
- But what if they get him?

305
00:22:04,665 --> 00:22:06,492
They aren't gonna get dad.

306
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,458
Dad's, like, the best.

307
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:12,537
I read in dad's book
that they got mom.

308
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:17,963
It's complicated, Sam.

309
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:21,636
If they got mom, they can get dad.
If they can get dad, they can get us.

310
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,255
It's not like that.

311
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:27,932
Okay, dad's fine.

312
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:29,849
We're fine.

313
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:32,101
Trust me.

314
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,276
- You okay?
- Yeah.

315
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,739
You know, dad's gonna be here
for Christmas.

316
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:49,449
Just like he always is.

317
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:54,965
I just wanna go to sleep, okay?

318
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,554
Yeah, okay.

319
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:08,436
It'll all be better when you wake up.

320
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,442
You'll see.

321
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,155
Promise.

322
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:39,499
So this is where Mrs. Wreath lives,
huh?

323
00:23:41,012 --> 00:23:44,215
Boy, can't you just feel the evil,
pagan vibe?

324
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:54,097
- Yes?
- Tell me you're the Madge Carrigan...

325
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:56,813
...who makes the wreaths.
- Why, yes I am.

326
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:58,445
- Hah. Bingo.
- Yeah.

327
00:23:58,613 --> 00:24:02,612
We were just admiring your wreaths
at Mr. Silar's place the other day.

328
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:03,816
You were?

329
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:07,453
Isn't that meadowsweet the finest
smelling thing you ever smelled?

330
00:24:07,623 --> 00:24:08,702
It is. It sure is.

331
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:11,792
But seem the problem is that
all your wreaths had sold out...

332
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,452
...before we got the chance to buy one.
- Oh, fudge.

333
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,121
You wouldn't happen to have
another one.

334
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,048
Oh, no. I'm afraid those were
the only ones I had for this season.

335
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,545
Why'd you decide to make them
out of meadowsweet?

336
00:24:23,722 --> 00:24:25,631
Why, the smell, of course.

337
00:24:25,808 --> 00:24:27,884
I don't think I've smelled
anything finer.

338
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,144
- Yeah. You mentioned that.
- What's going on, honey?

339
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:34,267
Well, just some nice boys,
asking about my wreaths, dear.

340
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,767
Oh, the wreaths are fine.
Fine wreaths.

341
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:39,982
Oh. Care for some peanut brittle?

342
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:41,988
Ooh... Mm. Heh.

343
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,479
We're okay.

344
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,947
I knew it.
Something was off with those two.

345
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:54,747
- What did you find?
- They lived in Seattle last year...

346
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,829
...where two abductions took place.

347
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:58,713
They moved here in January.

348
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:02,168
The Christmas crap wasn't boughs
of holly, it was vervain and mint.

349
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:04,384
- Pagan stuff?
- Serious pagan stuff.

350
00:25:04,555 --> 00:25:07,971
Ozzie and Harriett are keeping a god
hidden underneath their couch?

351
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:10,514
All I know is
we gotta check them out.

352
00:25:11,186 --> 00:25:15,101
What about Bobby? He's sure evergreen
stakes will kill this thing, right?

353
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:17,434
Yeah, he's sure.

354
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:45,753
See, plastic.

355
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:24,332
Hey, Dean.

356
00:27:05,302 --> 00:27:06,761
Oh.

357
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:54,174
Aah!
- Sam!

358
00:28:07,657 --> 00:28:11,821
Gosh, I wish you boys
hadn't come down here.

359
00:28:34,851 --> 00:28:36,262
Dean?

360
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:38,847
Are you okay?

361
00:28:39,648 --> 00:28:41,605
Yeah, I think so.

362
00:28:42,442 --> 00:28:46,025
So I guess we're dealing
with Mr. And Mrs. God.

363
00:28:46,363 --> 00:28:48,521
- Nice to know.
- Yeah.

364
00:28:48,698 --> 00:28:51,368
Oh, and here we thought
you two lazybones...

365
00:28:51,535 --> 00:28:54,322
...were gonna sleep straight through
all the fun stuff. Ha-ha.

366
00:28:54,496 --> 00:28:58,576
- And miss all this? No, we're partiers.
- Isn't he a kick in the pants, honey?

367
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,826
You're hunters, is what you are.

368
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:02,331
Yeah, and you're pagan gods.

369
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:05,077
So why don't we call it even
and go our separate ways?

370
00:29:05,257 --> 00:29:08,756
What, so you can bring back more
hunters and kill us? I don't think so.

371
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:12,012
You should have thought that
before you went snacking on humans.

372
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:13,592
- Oh, now, don't get all wet.
- Ho.

373
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:17,301
Why, we used to take over
a hundred tributes a year.

374
00:29:17,478 --> 00:29:19,720
And that's a fact.

375
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:22,898
Now, what do we take,
what, two, three?

376
00:29:23,442 --> 00:29:25,898
- Uhn.
- Hardy Boys here make five.

377
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:29,856
Now, that's not so bad, is it?

378
00:29:30,032 --> 00:29:32,191
You say it like that,
you are the Cunninghams.

379
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:34,325
You better show us a little respect.

380
00:29:34,495 --> 00:29:35,610
Or what?

381
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:38,245
- You'll eat us?
Not so fast.

382
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:42,200
- There's rituals to be followed first.
- Oh, we're just sticklers for ritual.

383
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,122
You know what kicks off
the shebang?

384
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:47,041
Let me guess. Meadowsweet.

385
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:49,173
Oh, shucks, you're all out of wreaths.

386
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:51,502
I guess we'll have
to cancel the sacrifice.

387
00:29:52,346 --> 00:29:54,672
Don't be such a gloomy Gus.

388
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:56,766
There.

389
00:29:57,101 --> 00:29:58,975
Oh.

390
00:29:59,312 --> 00:30:01,600
Don't they just look darling?

391
00:30:01,772 --> 00:30:03,148
Good enough to eat.

392
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:08,816
Alrighty-roo, step number two.

393
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:14,944
- Sammy.
No.

394
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,494
- Sammy?
No, no, don't.

395
00:30:16,662 --> 00:30:19,367
- Aah!
- Leave him alone, you son of a bitch!

396
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:22,750
You hear how they talk to us?
Ha-ha. To gods?

397
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,919
Listen, pal, back in the day,
we were worshipped by millions.

398
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:28,378
- Times have changed.
- Ha. Tell me about it.

399
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,753
All of a sudden, this Jesus character's
the hot, new thing in town.

400
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:35,843
Our altars are being burned down and
we're being hunted down like monsters.

401
00:30:36,016 --> 00:30:40,345
But did we say peep?
Oh, no, no, no, we did not.

402
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:42,394
Two millennium.

403
00:30:42,564 --> 00:30:46,432
We kept a low profile,
we got jobs, a mortgage.

404
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:49,435
- We... What was that word, dear?
- We assimilated.

405
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:51,356
Yeah, we assimilated.

406
00:30:51,532 --> 00:30:54,153
Why, we play bridge on Tuesdays
and Fridays.

407
00:30:54,326 --> 00:30:55,904
We're just like everybody else.

408
00:30:56,078 --> 00:30:58,035
You're not blending like you think,
lady.

409
00:30:58,205 --> 00:31:00,778
This might pinch a bit, dear.

410
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:02,998
Aah! You bitch!

411
00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:05,079
Oh, my goodness, me.

412
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:07,211
Somebody owes a nickel
to the swear jar.

413
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:11,749
Oh, do you know what I say
when I feel like swearing? Fudge.

414
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:14,006
I'll try and remember that.

415
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:16,753
You boys have no idea
how lucky you are.

416
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:19,553
There was a time when
kids came from miles around...

417
00:31:19,726 --> 00:31:23,060
...just to be sitting where you are.
- What do you think you're doing?

418
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:26,477
You fudging touch me again,
I'll fudging kill you!

419
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,025
Very good.

420
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:31,695
Aah!

421
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:38,194
No. No, don't.

422
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,295
Oh-ho. We've got a winner.

423
00:32:03,146 --> 00:32:05,851
- What else, dear?
Well, let's see.

424
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,100
Fingernail, blood. Oh!

425
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:11,443
Sweet Peter on a Popsicle stick.
Heh. I forgot the tooth.

426
00:32:11,654 --> 00:32:13,730
- Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, dear.

427
00:32:14,949 --> 00:32:16,776
- Merry Christmas, Sam.
- Mm.

428
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,780
- Open wide and say: Aah.
- Ach!

429
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,740
Aah!

430
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,506
So are you gonna get that?

431
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:35,092
You should get that.

432
00:32:38,932 --> 00:32:40,639
Come on.

433
00:32:43,937 --> 00:32:45,514
Merry Christmas.

434
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:48,179
- I told you I smelled fruitcake.
- You shouldn't have.

435
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:50,979
- Oh. Bite your tongue. It's my pleasure.
- Looks scrumptious.

436
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:53,145
We're going caroling, care to join?

437
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:54,400
You know we would...

438
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,359
It's my back.
Darn thing's giving me fits.

439
00:32:57,533 --> 00:32:59,028
That's a shame.

440
00:32:59,202 --> 00:33:01,360
- Oh, well, Merry Christmas.
- And to you too.

441
00:33:01,537 --> 00:33:04,160
- Are we still on for bridge tomorrow?
- With bells on.

442
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,326
- Yes. Okay, bye.
- Bye-bye.

443
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:17,877
Ah. Where were we?

444
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:34,602
What do we do now?
The stakes are in the basement.

445
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,318
Well, we need more evergreen, Dean.

446
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:41,109
I think I just found us some more.

447
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,113
Help me get this.

448
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:18,228
You little thing.

449
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,857
I loved that tree.

450
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:33,374
Madge!

451
00:35:04,788 --> 00:35:06,448
Merry Christmas.

452
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:29,659
Sam, wake up.

453
00:35:31,706 --> 00:35:33,912
Dad was here. Look what he brought.

454
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,574
- Dad was here?
- Yeah.

455
00:35:36,753 --> 00:35:38,579
Look at this. We made a killing.

456
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:41,716
Why didn't he try to wake me up?

457
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,004
He tried to, like, a thousand times.

458
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,092
He did?

459
00:35:47,598 --> 00:35:50,883
Yeah. Did I tell you he would
give us Christmas or what?

460
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:53,342
Go on. Dive in.

461
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:09,821
What is it?

462
00:36:10,496 --> 00:36:11,906
Sapphire Barbie?

463
00:36:12,956 --> 00:36:16,160
- Heh. Dad probably thinks you're a girl.
- Shut up.

464
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:17,580
Open that one.

465
00:36:27,304 --> 00:36:29,842
- Dad never showed, did he?
- Yeah, he did. I swear.

466
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:32,931
Dean, where did you get all this stuff?

467
00:36:38,524 --> 00:36:39,852
Nice house up the block.

468
00:36:42,194 --> 00:36:45,693
I swear, I didn't know
they were chick presents.

469
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:50,482
Look, I'm sure dad
would have been here if he could.

470
00:36:51,286 --> 00:36:53,445
- Lf he's alive.
- Don't say that.

471
00:36:53,997 --> 00:36:55,955
Of course he's alive.

472
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,750
He's dad.

473
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,708
Here.

474
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:09,217
- Take this.
- No.

475
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:11,180
No, that's for dad.

476
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:13,342
Dad lied to me.

477
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:14,882
I want you to have it.

478
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:20,683
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

479
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:40,541
Thank you, Sam. L...

480
00:37:40,712 --> 00:37:42,455
I love it.

481
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:02,975
Hey, you get the beer?

482
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:05,109
What's all this?

483
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:06,690
What do you think it is?

484
00:38:06,863 --> 00:38:08,026
It's Christmas.

485
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:15,698
What made you change your mind?

486
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:23,164
Here, try the eggnog.

487
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,665
Let me know
if it needs some more kick.

488
00:38:31,347 --> 00:38:32,378
- No, we're good.
- Yeah?

489
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:33,754
- Yeah.
- Good.

490
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:39,389
Well, have a seat.
Let's do Christmas stuff or whatever.

491
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,557
All right, first thing's first.

492
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:52,365
Merry Christmas, Sam.

493
00:38:54,537 --> 00:38:57,158
- Where did you get these?
- Someplace special.

494
00:38:57,873 --> 00:38:59,451
- Gas mart down the street.
- Ha-ha-ha.

495
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:00,656
Open them up.

496
00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:02,497
Yeah.

497
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:05,796
- Great minds think alike, Dean.
- Really?

498
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:07,340
Here you go.

499
00:39:07,508 --> 00:39:09,547
Oh, come on.

500
00:39:10,636 --> 00:39:12,130
Yeah.

501
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:14,465
Skin mags...

502
00:39:16,475 --> 00:39:17,554
...and shaving cream.

503
00:39:17,726 --> 00:39:19,269
You like?

504
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:22,636
Yeah, yeah.

505
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:32,741
Well, look at this.
Fuel for me and fuel for my baby.

506
00:39:34,453 --> 00:39:37,489
- These are awesome. Thanks.
- Good.

507
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,789
Merry Christmas, bro.

508
00:39:43,587 --> 00:39:45,460
Yeah, yeah.

509
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,911
Here, Merry Christmas.

510
00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:05,024
Hey, Dean.

511
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,453
Do you feel like watching the game?

512
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:22,905
Absolutely.

513
00:40:24,544 --> 00:40:25,623
All right.
