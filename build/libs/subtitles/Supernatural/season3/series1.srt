1
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:24,139
- You're offering your own soul?
- All you gotta do is bring Sam back.

2
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,100
- How long did you get?
- One year.

3
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,430
- Let Dean out of his deal now.
- I got a boss like everybody.

4
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:32,061
- Who holds the contract?
- I can't tell you.

5
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:35,562
There's a new leader rising in the West.

6
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:37,315
He doesn't like you very much.

7
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:39,482
Her name is Lilith.

8
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:41,450
- I know about your deal.
- Who told you?

9
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:44,289
The demon that holds it.
She holds mine too.

10
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:46,993
- She?
- Her name's Lilith.

11
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:51,667
So this is Ruby, huh?
She's a demon, Sam.

12
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:53,498
They want us dead, we want them dead.

13
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:55,132
What blade could kill a demon?

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,925
Yesterday, there was no such thing.

15
00:00:57,093 --> 00:00:59,501
Yellow Eyes had some pretty big plans
for you, Sam.

16
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,171
That you're special,
in that ESP vision kind of way.

17
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,258
No, that stuff's not happening anymore.

18
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:07,435
Black Dogs. They're seeing Hellhounds.
Demonic pit bulls.

19
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:15,148
- There's no way to save me from the pit?
- No.

20
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:17,821
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna go to hell.

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,154
We'll find a way to save you.

22
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:37,635
You're gonna die.
This is what you're gonna become.

23
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:42,448
Dig up anything good?

24
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:45,623
No, ahem, nothing good.

25
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:47,666
Well, Bobby has, finally.

26
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:50,210
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a way to find Lilith.

27
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:55,084
Wow, and with just, uh, 30 hours to go.

28
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:58,921
Hey, why don't we just make
a TJ run, you know?

29
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,718
<i>You know, some se?oritas, cervezas.
Uh, we could...</i>

30
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,224
What's Spanish for "donkey show"?

31
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:08,723
So if we do save you...

32
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:11,902
...let's never do that.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:16,700
Hey, hey, Dean, um...

34
00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:22,244
Look, we're cutting it close, I know.

35
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,498
But we're gonna get this done.

36
00:03:26,295 --> 00:03:28,621
I don't care what it takes, Dean.

37
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:31,380
You're not gonna go to hell.

38
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:34,336
I'm not gonna let you.

39
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,222
I swear.

40
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,932
Everything's gonna be okay.

41
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,524
Yeah, okay.

42
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:10,206
See, a name.
That's the whole kit and caboodle.

43
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:14,216
With the right name, the right ritual,
ain't nothing you can't suss out.

44
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,677
Like the town Lilith's in?

45
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:19,726
Kid, when I get done,
we'll know the street.

46
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:38,746
New Harmony, Indiana.

47
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:41,827
- And we have a winner.
All right.

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,002
- Let's go.
- Whoa, hold on. Holster it up there, Tex.

49
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:47,080
- What's the problem?
- "What's the problem"?

50
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:48,336
Where do I begin?

51
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:50,916
We don't even know
if Lilith actually holds my deal.

52
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:53,252
We're going off of Bela's intel.

53
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,099
When that bitch breathes,
the air comes out crooked, okay?

54
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:59,102
Second, even if we get to Lilith,
we have no way to gank her.

55
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,102
Third, isn't this the same Lilith that
wants your head? Should I continue?

56
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:05,599
- Ha. Ain't you bringing down the room?
- It's a gift.

57
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:07,521
I'm sorry, what are we supposed to do?

58
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:11,029
I gotta die. Doesn't mean you have to.
We go in smart or we don't go in.

59
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,654
- Lf that's the case, I have the answer.
- You do?

60
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:15,985
Yeah, a sure-fire way
to confirm it's Lilith.

61
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:19,080
And a way to get us a bona fide,
demon-killing Ginsu.

62
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:21,207
Damn it, Sam, no.

63
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:24,247
We are so past arguing.
Dean, I am summoning Ruby.

64
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:26,213
The hell you are,
we've enough problems.

65
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:27,496
Exactly.

66
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:29,798
And we got no time
and no choice either.

67
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,804
Come on, man, she is the Miss Universe
of lying skanks, okay?

68
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:35,262
She told you
that she could save me, huh? Lie.

69
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,307
She seems to know
everything about Lilith...

70
00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:39,351
...but forgot to mention
Lilith owns my soul.

71
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,478
Okay, she's a liar.
She's still got that knife.

72
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:42,977
- Dean...
- She works for Lilith.

73
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,977
Give me another option, tell me.

74
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:47,109
- Sam's right.
- No, damn it.

75
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:54,077
Just no.

76
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:57,951
We are not gonna make
the same mistakes all over again.

77
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,832
You guys wanna save me?
Find something else.

78
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,684
Where're you going, Bobby?

79
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:21,978
I guess to find something else.

80
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:26,048
You know, phones work too.

81
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:29,336
Hey, Sam. How's tricks?

82
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:33,464
- How do you get around so fast?
- I got the Super Bowl jetpack.

83
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:36,221
So...

84
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:38,268
...you called?

85
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,934
Did you know?

86
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:43,692
- Um, gonna need a tiny bit more.
- About Dean's deal.

87
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,446
- That Lilith holds the contract.
- Yes, I did.

88
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:52,359
And what?
You didn't think that was important?

89
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:53,867
- You weren't ready.
- For what?

90
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,749
If I told you, you two yahoos would have
just charged after her halfcocked.

91
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,124
And Lilith would have peeled the meat
from your pretty, pretty faces.

92
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:04,206
Well, we're ready now.

93
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:07,130
I want your knife.

94
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,006
You're right about one thing.

95
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,643
If you are ready...

96
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:17,394
And now's the time too.

97
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:19,523
Lilith's guard's down.

98
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:21,436
Is that so?

99
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:24,732
She's on shore leave. A little R and R.

100
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:28,276
- What the hell does that mean?
- Trust me, you don't wanna know.

101
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:30,860
You didn't lose those hex bags
I gave you?

102
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:32,153
We got them.

103
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:35,082
Good, then she won't sense
that you're coming.

104
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:38,499
- So you'll give us the knife?
- No.

105
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:42,000
- You just said...
- You wanna charge in...

106
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:43,966
...with one little pig-sticker?

107
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:45,761
It's a waste of a true-blue window.

108
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,502
Like hitting Hitler
with that exploding briefcase. Forget it.

109
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:49,845
Okay, then how?

110
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:55,429
- I know how to save your brother.
- No, you don't.

111
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:58,476
You told Dean you couldn't.
You've been lying to me all along.

112
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,606
- So just give me your knife.
- You're not the one I've been lying to.

113
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:03,653
- Oh, so you could save him?
- No.

114
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:06,324
But you can.

115
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:12,696
- What?
- Sam, you've got some God-given talent.

116
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:16,041
Well, not God-given,
but you get the gist.

117
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:17,540
All that psychic crap?

118
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:20,714
That's gone ever since Yellow Eyes died.

119
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:24,503
Not gone. Dormant.

120
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,221
And not just visions either.

121
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:29,547
Why do you think
Lilith is so scared of you?

122
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:31,304
Right, she's scared of me.

123
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:34,313
If you wanted, you could wipe her
off the map without moving a muscle.

124
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:36,225
- I don't believe you.
- It's the truth.

125
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,273
And you decided to tell me this
just now?

126
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,602
Um, demon?

127
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,902
Manipulative's kind of
in the job description.

128
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,858
Fact is, is that you never
would have considered it.

129
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,574
- Not until you were...
- Desperate enough?

130
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,076
You don't like being different.

131
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:57,084
You hate the way
Dean looks at you sometimes.

132
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:59,748
Like you're some sort of sideshow freak.

133
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:03,678
But suck it up, because we got
a lot of ground to cover...

134
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:06,088
...and we gotta do it fast,
but we can do it.

135
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,760
Look, call me a bitch,
hate me all you want...

136
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:13,772
...but I have never lied to you, Sam.

137
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,220
Not ever.

138
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:21,018
And I'm telling you,
you can save your brother.

139
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:22,776
And I can show you how.

140
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,070
So that's you, huh?
Our slutty little Yoda.

141
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:28,371
Dean.

142
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,577
- Charming as ever.
- Oh, I knew you'd show up.

143
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:35,876
Because I knew Sam wouldn't listen.

144
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:40,623
But you're not gonna teach him anything.
You understand me? Over my dead body.

145
00:10:40,803 --> 00:10:42,628
Oh, well, you're right about that.

146
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:45,422
What you are gonna do
is give me that knife.

147
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:48,635
And then you'll go crawl back
into whatever slop you came from...

148
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,721
...and never bother me again,
are we clear?

149
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:52,972
Your brother is carrying
a bomb inside of him...

150
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:54,727
...and we'd be stupid not to use it.

151
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:56,774
- Dean, look, just hold on...
- Sam, don't.

152
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:59,815
- You blind? Can't you see this is a trick?
- That's not true.

153
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:03,358
She wants you to give in to this whole
demonic, psychic whatever, okay?

154
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:06,156
She wants you to become
her little Antichrist superstar.

155
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:09,615
I want Lilith dead. That's all.

156
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,072
- Why?
- I've told you why.

157
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,541
Oh, right, yeah.
Because you were human once.

158
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:16,120
And you like kittens
and long walks on the beach.

159
00:11:16,298 --> 00:11:19,050
You know, I am so sick
of proving myself to you.

160
00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:22,920
You wanna save yourself?
This is how, you dumb, spineless dick.

161
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,649
Ruby, hey. Oh! Unh!

162
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,665
What the hell are you grinning at?

163
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,713
Missing something?

164
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,059
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.

165
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:18,989
Like I said, I knew you'd come.

166
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:23,410
Wait, you're just gonna leave me here?

167
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:25,488
Let's go, Sam.

168
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:29,200
Oh. Oh, so you're
just too stupid to live, is that it?

169
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:31,950
Then fine. You deserve hell.

170
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:33,754
And I wish I could be there, Dean.

171
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:37,292
I wish I could smell the flesh
sizzle off your bones.

172
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,628
I wish I could be there
to hear you scream!

173
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:43,553
And I wish you'd shut your pie hole,
but we don't always get what we want.

174
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,867
We're just gonna let
Ruby rot down there?

175
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,749
That's the idea.

176
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:11,880
Dean, what if, um...?

177
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:17,001
What if Ruby's right?
What if I can take out Lilith?

178
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:24,592
- Quit looking at me like that.
- Give her the stare and Lilith goes poof?

179
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,185
I don't know what Ruby meant.
Maybe we should just go ask her.

180
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:30,398
You wanted the knife,
I got you the knife.

181
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:31,765
Listen to me for a second.

182
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:35,562
Last time, Lilith snapped her fingers
and put 30 demons on our ass.

183
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:37,234
All we got is one little knife?

184
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:40,279
- We go in smart or we don't go in at all.
- This ain't smart.

185
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,695
We got one shot at this, Dean. Just one.

186
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:46,158
So if there's a sure-fire way,
then maybe we should just talk about it.

187
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:49,999
Sam, we are not gonna make
the same mistake all over again.

188
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:51,797
You said that, but what does that mean?

189
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,246
Don't you see a pattern?

190
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:56,177
Dad's deal, my deal, now this.

191
00:13:56,345 --> 00:14:00,010
Every time one of us is up the creek,
the other's begging to sell their soul.

192
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:01,725
That's all this is, man.

193
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:04,680
Ruby's just jerking your chain
down the road.

194
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:08,104
You know what it's paved with,
and you know where it's going.

195
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:11,313
Dean.

196
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:17,564
What are you afraid is gonna happen?

197
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:19,696
This is me, I can handle it.

198
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,117
- And if it'll save you...
- Why even risk it?

199
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,292
Because you're my brother.

200
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,040
Because you did the same thing for me.

201
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:33,336
I know.

202
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:36,294
And look how that turned out.

203
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,300
All I'm saying...

204
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:46,148
Sammy, all I'm saying
is that you're my weak spot.

205
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:50,476
You are. And I'm yours.

206
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:55,402
No, you don't mean that. We're family.

207
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:58,944
I know. And those evil sons of bitches
know it too.

208
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:04,082
I mean, what we'll do for each other,
you know, how far we'll go.

209
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,414
They're using it against us.

210
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,495
So we just stop
looking out for each other?

211
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:09,498
No, we stop being martyrs.

212
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:12,627
Man, we stop spreading it
for these demons.

213
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:17,346
We take this knife
and we go after Lilith our way.

214
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,473
The way Dad taught us to.

215
00:15:21,895 --> 00:15:24,054
And if we go down, then, uh...

216
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,933
...then we go down swinging.

217
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:31,185
What do you think?

218
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:39,317
I think you should have been jamming
"Eye of the Tiger. "

219
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:41,372
Oh, bite me.

220
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,499
You know,
I totally rehearsed that speech too.

221
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,166
- So, Indiana, huh?
- Yeah, where Lilith is on shore leave.

222
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:52,336
Yeah, I guess.

223
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:55,679
Tell me something.

224
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:58,385
What the hell does a demon do for fun?

225
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:13,022
- Hey, Pat.
- Tom.

226
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,569
- How's that granddaughter of yours?
- Home sick, poor thing.

227
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:19,664
- Darn bug that's going around now.
- Oh, that's too bad.

228
00:16:19,832 --> 00:16:21,908
You give her a big old hug
from me and Judy.

229
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:25,833
- You bet. Take her easy, Tom.
- You too, Pat.

230
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:45,771
Where is she?

231
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:51,021
- Upstairs, playing with Freckles.
- Lf we just sit here, we're dead.

232
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,776
- She'll hear you.
It's her or us.

233
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,110
- It's my baby girl.
- Not anymore.

234
00:16:56,913 --> 00:16:58,741
There's something inside her.

235
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,540
Shut your mouth. She's coming.

236
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:05,960
- What were you guys talking about?
- Just how much we love you.

237
00:17:06,131 --> 00:17:09,797
- What happened to your dress?
- Oh, Freckles was mean to me.

238
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:14,594
That's... That's nice, dear.

239
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,885
Daddy, will you push me on the swing?

240
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,476
Well, sure, honey.

241
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:24,066
But don't you wanna change first?

242
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:29,447
I mean, you don't want the neighbors
to see all that blood.

243
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,487
Oh, you're so smart. I love you, Daddy.

244
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,652
I love you too.

245
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:41,416
Hey, sweetie,
you think maybe after a while...

246
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:44,545
...do you think maybe you could...

247
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:48,461
...let us go?

248
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,469
- Why?
- I, uh...

249
00:17:56,936 --> 00:17:59,178
- Well, I don't know.
- Don't you wanna be here?

250
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:02,853
Don't you love me?

251
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:06,185
- Well, sure, I do.
- Oh, we all do, honey.

252
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:09,280
- We all love you so much.
Don't be mean to me, Daddy.

253
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:12,367
Like Freckles or what's-her-name,
that mean old babysitter.

254
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:17,781
L... I'm sorry.

255
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:24,715
That's okay, silly. Now let's go and play.

256
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:36,052
Where do you think you're going?

257
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,986
We got the knife.

258
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:49,151
And you intend to use it without me.

259
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:51,817
Do I look like
a ditch-able prom date to you?

260
00:18:52,454 --> 00:18:56,404
- No, Bobby, of course not.
- This is about me and Sam.

261
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,873
- Okay, this isn't your fight.
- The hell it isn't.

262
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:02,713
Family don't end with blood, boy.

263
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:09,424
Besides, you need me.

264
00:19:09,764 --> 00:19:11,840
- Bobby...
- You're playing wounded.

265
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:15,600
Tell me, how many hallucinations
have you had so far?

266
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:22,019
- How'd you know?
- That's what happens...

267
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,270
...when you got Hellhounds on your butt.

268
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:26,524
And because I'm smart.

269
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,285
I'll follow.

270
00:19:38,962 --> 00:19:41,453
Don't be stopping to pee
every 10 minutes either.

271
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:52,433
Hey, Dean?

272
00:19:52,602 --> 00:19:54,097
Yeah?

273
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:57,433
You know, if this doesn't, uh...

274
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:00,268
If this doesn't go the way we want...

275
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:02,484
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- "No" what?

276
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:06,818
You're not gonna bust out
the misty goodbye speech, okay?

277
00:20:06,992 --> 00:20:11,322
And if this is my last day on earth,
I do not want it to be socially awkward.

278
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:17,453
You know what I do want?

279
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:26,257
- Bon Jovi?
- Bon Jovi rocks on occasion.

280
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:37,394
Come on.

281
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,791
We getting pulled over?

282
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:44,132
I got a busted taillight.

283
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,178
It's not like we're in a hurry or nothing.

284
00:21:59,071 --> 00:22:02,071
- Problem, officer?
- License and registration, please.

285
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:06,074
Do you realize you have a taillight out,
Mr. Hagar?

286
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:09,949
Yes. Yes, sir.

287
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,743
Uh, you know,
I've been meaning to take care of that.

288
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:15,457
As a matter of fact...

289
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:18,288
Hey!

290
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,807
- What the hell happened?
- Dean just killed a demon.

291
00:22:34,775 --> 00:22:36,602
How'd you know?

292
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,146
I just knew.

293
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,067
I could see its face.

294
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:43,612
Its real face under that one.

295
00:22:56,466 --> 00:22:58,090
So, what? Now you're seeing demons?

296
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:02,043
I've been seeing all kinds of things lately,
but nothing like this.

297
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:05,058
- Actually, it's not all that crazy.
- How's it not that crazy?

298
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:07,715
What you got?
Just over five hours to go?

299
00:23:07,894 --> 00:23:09,555
You're piercing the veil, Dean.

300
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,853
You're glimpsing the B-side.

301
00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:16,307
- Little less New Age-y, please.
- You're almost hell's bitch.

302
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:19,230
So you can see hell's other bitches.

303
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:20,569
Thank you.

304
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:22,201
It'll actually come in handy.

305
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,111
Glad my doomed soul's
good for something.

306
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:25,485
Damn right it is.

307
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:28,071
Lilith's probably got demons
stashed all over town.

308
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:32,081
We can't let them sound the alarm.
If she knows we're here, we're dead.

309
00:23:32,253 --> 00:23:33,748
Well, this is a terrific plan.

310
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:37,256
I'm excited to be a part of it.
Can we go, please?

311
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:47,844
Happy birthday, sweetie.

312
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,479
Happy birthday.

313
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:52,601
Yay, it's my birthday every day.

314
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,029
Mm. Cake.

315
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:02,612
Again.

316
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:04,365
It's good.

317
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:06,662
Hey, Grandpa, can I ask you something?

318
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:08,327
Sure, jellybean, anything.

319
00:24:08,501 --> 00:24:10,624
Why'd you try to go to Mr. Weprin
for help?

320
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:14,338
Well, I didn't.

321
00:24:14,507 --> 00:24:16,963
- I don't know what you mean.
- You're a big fat liar.

322
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:18,416
I'm sorry.

323
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:20,126
It was a mistake.

324
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:22,631
Did you two know about this?

325
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:29,105
No.

326
00:24:32,402 --> 00:24:33,812
No.

327
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:39,694
- Grandpa, you don't love me?
- I do.

328
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:42,655
- I do. I love you.
No, you don't.

329
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:44,454
You're lying again.

330
00:24:44,623 --> 00:24:45,952
You're just a mean old man.

331
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:47,948
Do something.

332
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:50,831
Help me, please.

333
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:53,461
I don't think I like you anymore.

334
00:24:56,302 --> 00:24:57,880
Nobody scream, okay?

335
00:24:58,054 --> 00:24:59,963
Screaming makes me mad.

336
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:11,142
Mommy, can I have
ice cream with mine?

337
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,527
It's the little girl.

338
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:20,572
Oh, God, her face is awful.

339
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:22,820
All right, then let's go.
We're wasting time.

340
00:25:22,996 --> 00:25:24,029
Wait.

341
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:26,164
For what?
For her to kill the rest of them?

342
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:29,454
Yeah, and us too, if we're not careful.
Look.

343
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:33,164
See the real go-getter mailman
on the clock at 9 p. M?

344
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:35,750
And Mr. Rogers over there.

345
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:38,004
- Demons?
Yes.

346
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,967
Okay, fine. We...
We ninja past those guys, sneak in.

347
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:44,227
- Then give a Colombian necktie to a girl?
- I know it's awful.

348
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:47,064
- You think?
- This isn't just about saving you, Dean.

349
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:48,691
This is about saving everybody.

350
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:52,393
She's gotta be stopped, son.

351
00:25:55,949 --> 00:25:57,360
Oh, damn it.

352
00:25:57,534 --> 00:26:02,280
Read it again, Mommy.
- But I've read it 26 times.

353
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:03,702
Again.

354
00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:11,248
"Once upon a time,
in the town of Selene...

355
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:13,755
...lived a beautiful princess named Cleo.

356
00:26:14,677 --> 00:26:18,046
But the town was plagued
with an evil dragon...

357
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:21,391
...that demanded
the blood of the children.

358
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,767
And the princess was doomed
to be sacrificed...

359
00:26:23,938 --> 00:26:26,346
...to the dark and terrible dragon. "

360
00:26:26,524 --> 00:26:27,555
Hmm.

361
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,589
I'd like my knife back, please.

362
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:38,676
Or your neck snaps like a chicken bone.

363
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:41,520
He doesn't have it. Take it easy.

364
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:45,224
How the hell did you get out?

365
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,856
What you don't know about me
could fill a book.

366
00:27:48,028 --> 00:27:49,190
Oh.

367
00:27:49,362 --> 00:27:50,773
What?

368
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:53,272
Nothing. I just...

369
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,151
I couldn't see it before,
but you are one ugly broad.

370
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:00,160
Sam, give me the knife
before you hurt yourself.

371
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:04,417
- You'll get it when this is over.
- It's already over.

372
00:28:04,587 --> 00:28:08,371
I gave you a way to save Dean,
you shot me down. Now it's too late.

373
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:11,385
He's dead.
And I'm not gonna let you die too.

374
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:13,012
Try and stop me and I'll kill you...

375
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:16,550
...bitch.
- Hit me with your best shot, baby.

376
00:28:16,725 --> 00:28:18,718
Guys, guys. Hey.

377
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,726
Have your little catfight later.

378
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,732
- So much for the element of surprise.
- Go. Run, run, run.

379
00:28:35,704 --> 00:28:37,828
Okay, okay.

380
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:40,496
What the hell's taking Bobby?

381
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:43,075
I'm trying.

382
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:03,354
- You think Lilith knows we're here?
- Probably.

383
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:20,657
Shh.

384
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:22,461
We're here to help, okay?

385
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,963
I'm gonna move my hand, and
we're gonna talk nice and quiet. Okay?

386
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:30,971
Sir, where is your daughter?

387
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:33,879
It's not... It's not her anymore.

388
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:35,766
Where is she?

389
00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:38,094
Upstairs. In her bedroom.

390
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,682
Okay, okay, okay. Listen to me.

391
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:41,765
I want you to go downstairs
to the basement...

392
00:29:41,942 --> 00:29:44,349
...put a line of salt at the door.
Do you understand?

393
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:47,481
- Not without my wife. No.
- Yes, without your wife.

394
00:31:24,385 --> 00:31:25,879
Do it.

395
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:31,933
Do it.

396
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:35,218
Do it.

397
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:37,100
Do it.

398
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:41,600
Do it.

399
00:31:43,446 --> 00:31:44,858
Do it. Hurry!

400
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:48,910
It's not her.

401
00:31:50,454 --> 00:31:51,949
It's not in the girl anymore.

402
00:31:52,498 --> 00:31:53,529
Mommy.

403
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:57,616
Mommy's here.
Mommy's here. It's okay.

404
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:07,467
Oh, damn it.

405
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:11,760
No matter what, you, your husband
and your daughter stay in the basement.

406
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:14,972
Okay.
- Well, I hate to be a told-you-so.

407
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:17,851
- All right, Ruby, where is she?
- I don't know.

408
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:19,769
Well, can she get past the sprinklers?

409
00:32:19,944 --> 00:32:21,937
At her pay grade,
she ain't sweating holy water.

410
00:32:22,113 --> 00:32:25,031
Okay, you win. What do I have to do?

411
00:32:25,283 --> 00:32:27,074
- What do you mean?
- To save Dean.

412
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:28,737
What do you need me to do?

413
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:31,285
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Shut up.

414
00:32:31,457 --> 00:32:33,284
- Ruby.
- You had your chance.

415
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,710
You can't just flip a switch.
We needed time.

416
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:40,000
There's gotta be something, some way.
Whatever it is, I'll do it.

417
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,250
Don't, Dean.
I'm not gonna let you go to hell.

418
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:44,467
Yes, you are!

419
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:47,713
Yes, you are.

420
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:50,716
I'm sorry.

421
00:32:50,894 --> 00:32:52,768
I mean, this was all my fault.

422
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,348
I know that.

423
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:59,475
But what you're doing
is not gonna save me.

424
00:33:00,571 --> 00:33:02,480
It's only gonna kill you.

425
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:04,365
Then what am I supposed to do?

426
00:33:08,371 --> 00:33:10,031
Keep fighting.

427
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:13,833
Take care of my wheels.

428
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,756
Sam, remember what Dad taught you.

429
00:33:21,678 --> 00:33:23,254
Okay?

430
00:33:24,597 --> 00:33:26,922
And remember what I taught you.

431
00:33:55,756 --> 00:33:57,795
I'm sorry, Dean.

432
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:01,294
I wouldn't wish this
upon my worst enemy.

433
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:11,977
- Hellhound.
- Where?

434
00:34:13,691 --> 00:34:15,102
There.

435
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,886
Give me the knife.
Maybe I can fight it off.

436
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,470
- What?
Come on.

437
00:34:47,644 --> 00:34:49,969
That dust won't last forever.

438
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:54,273
Wait.

439
00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:56,315
You wanna die?

440
00:34:56,487 --> 00:34:57,980
Sam, that's not Ruby.

441
00:34:58,155 --> 00:34:59,318
It's not Ruby.

442
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:11,415
- How long have you been in her?
- Not long.

443
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:12,618
But I like it.

444
00:35:13,255 --> 00:35:15,545
It's all grown-up and pretty.

445
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:19,423
And where's Ruby?

446
00:35:20,305 --> 00:35:23,009
She was a very bad girl.

447
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:25,423
So I sent her far, far away.

448
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:28,093
You know, I should've seen it before.

449
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:30,180
But you all look alike to me.

450
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:38,486
Hello, Sam.

451
00:35:39,783 --> 00:35:43,947
I've wanted to meet you
for a very long time.

452
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:52,205
Your lips are soft.

453
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:56,921
All right, so you have me.

454
00:35:57,302 --> 00:35:58,880
Let my brother go.

455
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:01,632
Silly goose.

456
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:04,595
You want a bargain,
you have to have something that I want.

457
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:07,180
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

458
00:36:07,354 --> 00:36:09,015
You don't.

459
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,766
So is this your big plan, huh?

460
00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:15,523
Drag me to hell, kill Sam,
and then what?

461
00:36:15,696 --> 00:36:18,782
- Become queen bitch?
- I don't have to answer to puppy chow.

462
00:36:27,543 --> 00:36:29,001
Sic him, boy.

463
00:36:33,507 --> 00:36:34,752
No!

464
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:38,176
No, stop.

465
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:41,384
Stop.

466
00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:43,974
Stop it! No.

467
00:36:49,316 --> 00:36:51,024
No. Stop it.

468
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:52,896
Stop it!

469
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,648
No.

470
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:56,696
Yes.

471
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:33,309
Back.

472
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:37,656
I said, back.

473
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:43,206
I don't think so.

474
00:38:13,365 --> 00:38:14,988
No.

475
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:19,036
No.

476
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:22,498
Dean.

477
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:29,379
Dean.

478
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,721
No!

479
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,479
No.

480
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:46,307
No.

481
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:50,988
Somebody help me.

482
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:56,697
Sam!

483
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,579
Sam!
