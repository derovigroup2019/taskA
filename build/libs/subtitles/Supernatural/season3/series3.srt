1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,200
LOOK, DAD'S GONE NOW.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,900
WE HAVE TO CARRY OUT HIS LEGACY,

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,400
AND THAT MEANS HUNTING DOWN
AS MANY EVIL SONS OF BITCHES
AS WE POSSIBLY CAN.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,700
THEN

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,500
DID I DIE?

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,200
DID YOU SELL YOUR SOUL FOR ME?

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
HOW LONG DO YOU GET?

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,200
ONE YEAR.

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,500
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT.

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,700
I GUESS I GOT TO SAVE <i>YOUR</i> ASS
FOR A CHANGE.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
WHAT KIND OF BLADE
CAN KILL A DEMON?

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,200
YESTERDAY, I WOULD HAVE
SAID THERE WAS NO SUCH THING.

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,600
WHO WAS THAT MASKED CHICK?

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,600
YOU EVER RUN ACROSS A GUY
NAMED GORDON WALKER?

15
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,200
HE IS DANGEROUS TO EVERYONE
AND EVERYTHING AROUND HIM.

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,200
THIS DEMON TELLS ME
THEY HAVE SOLDIERS

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,000
TO FIGHT IN THIS COMING WAR

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,900
HUMANS FIGHTING ON HELL'S SIDE.

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,900
I KNOW ABOUT SAM'S VISIONS.

20
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,200
I KNOW EVERYTHING,
AND YOUR BROTHER'S FAIR GAME.

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,100
AAH!

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,900
GORDON SHOULD BE REACHING FOR THE SOAP
FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS, AT LEAST.

23
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,500
TELL ME WHO YOU ARE!

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,900
YOU'RE A DEMON.

25
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,700
I'M HERE

26
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,900
BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP YOU.

27
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,300
WHAT COULD <i>YOU</i> POSSIBLY --

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,300
I CAN HELP YOU
SAVE YOUR BROTHER.

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,400
NOW

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,200

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
IT'S TRUE.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,300
THE DEVIL'S GATE
WAS OPENED IN WYOMING.

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
BIG...

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,500
ST. HELENS BIG.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,800
THERE'S NO SOLID FIX
ON HOW MANY DEMONS GOT OUT,

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,800
BUT IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS --
AN ARMY.

39
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,800
SAM WINCHESTER WAS THERE,

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,800
WASN'T HE?

41
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,500
TALKED TO A GUY WHO KNOWS GUY
WHO KNOWS BOBBY SINGER,

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,100
AND, YEAH, LOOKS LIKE THE
WINCHESTERS WERE AT GROUND ZERO

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,500
WHEN THE GATE WAS POPPED.

44
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,400
BUT SINGER SAID
THEY WENT IN THERE TO STOP IT.

45
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
MNH-MNH.

46
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500
BOBBY'S EDGE
AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE.

47
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,700
SAM COULD HAVE HIM BELIEVING
ANYTHING BY NOW.

48
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,700
LISTEN, GORDON.

49
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,200
AS FAR AS TALK GOES,

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,800
SAM WINCHESTER CHECKS OUT.

51
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,000
HE'S A HUNTER. THAT'S ALL.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
THAT'S ALL?

53
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,600
KUBRICK...

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,100
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
HE'S HUMAN.

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
THINK I'M CRAZY?

56
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
I TOLD YOU THERE WAS A WAR COMING 

57
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,500
SIX MONTHS AGO.

58
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,200
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,900
IT'S HERE.

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,700
NOW I'M TELLING YOU THIS BOY
IS A PART OF IT.

61
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,300
TRACK HIM DOWN, KUBRICK.

62
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,300
YOU'LL COME TO SEE IT, TOO.

63
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,200
SAM WINCHESTER MUST DIE.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
BECAUSE DEMON,
THAT'S WHY.

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,700
I MEAN, THE SECOND YOU FIND OUT
THIS RUBY CHICK IS A DEMON,

66
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,000
YOU GO FOR THE HOLY WATER.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,200
- YOU DON'T CHAT.
- NO ONE WAS CHATTING, DEAN.

68
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,100
OH, YEAH? THEN WHY DIDN'T
YOU SEND HER ASS BACK TO HELL?

69
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,900
BECAUSE -- BECAUSE SHE SAID SHE
MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP US OUT.

70
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,700
HOW?

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,800
OH, REALLY, SAM? HOW?
HOW COULD SHE <i>POSSIBLY</i> HELP US?

72
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
SHE TOLD ME
SHE COULD HELP <i>YOU,</i> OKAY?

73
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,100
HELP YOU
OUT OF THE CROSSROADS DEAL.

74
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,700
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, HUH?
SHE'S LYING.

75
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,300
YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT,
DON'T YOU?

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,500
SHE KNOWS WHAT YOUR WEAKNESS IS.
IT'S ME.

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,900
WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY?

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,700
- DUDE?
- NOTHING.

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,700
NOTHING, OKAY?!

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
LOOK, I'M NOT
AN IDIOT, DEAN.

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,800
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT TRUSTING HER.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,700
I'M TALKING ABOUT <i>USING</i> HER.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,300
I MEAN, WE'RE AT WAR, RIGHT?

84
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
AND WE DON'T KNOW JACK
ABOUT THE ENEMY.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. 

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,300
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

87
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
HELL, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THEY <i>WANT.</i>

88
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,200
NOW, THIS RUBY GIRL

89
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,700
KNOWS MORE THAN WE WILL
 <i>EVER</i> FIND OUT ON OUR OWN.

90
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,400
NOW, YES, IT'S A RISK.
I KNOW THAT.

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,700
BUT WE NEED TO TAKE IT.

92
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,300
YOU'RE OKAY, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU'RE FEELING OKAY?

93
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,100
YES, I'M FINE! WHY ARE YOU
ALWAYS ASKING ME THAT?

94
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,800
IT'S NOT MINE.

95
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,800
NOPE.

96
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,500
CHECK THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
IT'S DAD'S.

97
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
- DAD'S?
- YES. 

98
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,900
I KEEP IT CHARGED IN CASE
ANY OF HIS OLD CONTACTS CALL.

99
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,000
HELLO?

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,700
YES, THIS IS EDGAR CASEY.

101
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,400
NONO, NO, NO. DON'T -- DON'T CALL THE POLICE.
I'LL HANDLE THIS MYSELF.

102
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,100
THANKS.

103
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,100
YOU KNOW, CAN YOU JUST -- CAN
YOU JUST LOCK IT BACK UP FOR ME?

104
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,700
GREAT.

105
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,800
UH, I, UH -- I DON'T HAVE
MY-MY BOOK IN FRONT OF ME.

106
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,100
DO YOU -- DO YOU HAVE
THE ADDRESS SO I CAN...

107
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,700
SURE. 
OKAY. 

108
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,900
GO AHEAD.

109
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,000
RIGHT.

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,900
THANKS A LOT.

111
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,700
DAD EVER TELL YOU HE KEPT A CONTAINER 
AT A STORAGE PLACE?

112
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
- WHAT?
- OUTSIDE OF BUFFALO.

113
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,900
NO WAY.

114
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,700
YEAH. 

115
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,300
AND SOMEONE
JUST BROKE INTO IT.

116
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,400
bad day at black rock

117
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,800
SO, YOU'VE GOT NO HARD EVIDENCE
ON THIS WINCHESTER GUY?

118
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,200
YOU'RE JUST WORKING OFF
GORDON'S INSTINCTS.

119
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,700
YOU EVER HUNT WITH GORDON?

120
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,700
NO. I HEARD HE'S GOOD.

121
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
GOOD?

122
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,600
HE'S THE BEST.

123
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,700
SAVED MY ASS MORE TIMES
THAN I CAN COUNT.

124
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,600
SO, IF HE SAYS
SAM WINCHESTER'S DANGEROUS,

125
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
I BELIEVE HIM.

126
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,800
HE'S GONNA BE
COVERING HIS TRACKS.

127
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,100
WON'T BE EASY TO FIND.

128
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,400
LAST I GOT PUTS HIM IN NEBRASKA
THREE WEEKS BACK.

129
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,700
NOT EXACTLY A <i>FRESH</i> LEAD.

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,600
HE AIN'T <i>INVISIBLE,</i> CREEDIE.

131
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,400
SOME HUNTER OUT THERE
KNOWS SOMETHING.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,100
SO WE START CALLING
OUR CONTACTS.

133
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,700
ALL WE NEED IS ONE BREAK.

134
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,100
DON'T PLAY WITH MY JESUS.

135
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
MAN.

136
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
WHAT?

137
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
JUST DAD.
YOU KNOW, HIM AND HIS SECRETS.

138
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,400
WE SPENT ALL THIS TIME
WITH THIS GUY,

139
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
AND IT'S LIKE WE BARELY EVEN
KNOW THE MAN.

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,000
WELL, WE'RE ABOUT
TO LEARN <i>SOMETHING.</i>

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
NO DEMONS ALLOWED.

142
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
BLOOD.

143
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
CHECK THIS OUT.

144
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,400
WHOEVER BROKE IN HERE
GOT ATTACKED.

145
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
DEAR, OLD DAD.

146
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,800
I GOT TWO SETS
OF BOOT TRACKS.

147
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,900
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT WAS A TWO-MAN JOB.

148
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,100
AND OUR FRIEND
WITH THE BUCKSHOT IN HIM --

149
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,800
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE KEPT WALKING.

150
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

151
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,100
DAD WOULD DO WORK HERE
OR SOMETHING?

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,900
LIVING THE HIGH LIFE,
AS USUAL.

153
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,600
1995.

154
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
NO WAY!

155
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,200
THAT'S MY DIVISION CHAMPIONSHIP
SOCCER TROPHY.

156
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,300
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE KEPT THIS.

157
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,500
IT WAS THE PROBABLY THE CLOSEST
YOU EVER CAME TO BEING A BOY.

158
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,200
OH, WOW!

159
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,900
IT'S MY FIRST SAWED-OFF.
I MADE IT MYSELF.

160
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,000
SIXTH GRADE.

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,700
HOLY CRAP.

162
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,100
LOOK AT THIS.
HE HAD LAND MINES...

163
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,800
WHICH THEY DIDN'T TAKE.

164
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,000
OR THE GUNS.

165
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,400
GUESS THEY KNEW
WHAT THEY WERE AFTER, HUH?

166
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
HEY, DEAN,
CHECK THIS OUT.

167
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
SEE THESE SYMBOLS?

168
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,100
HE USED BINDING MAGIC.

169
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,700
THESE ARE CURSE BOXES.

170
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,000
CURSE BOXES?

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,700
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP
THE EVIL MOJO <i>IN,</i> RIGHT?

172
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
KIND OF LIKE
THE PANDORA DEAL.

173
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,700
YEAH, THEY'RE BUILT TO CONTAIN
THE POWER OF THE CURSED OBJECT.

174
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
DAD'S JOURNAL DID MENTION
A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF,

175
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,100
YOU KNOW, DANGEROUS,
HEXED ITEMS, FETISHES.

176
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,500
HE NEVER DID SAY
WHERE THEY ENDED UP.

177
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,200
YEAH.

178
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
THIS MUST BE
HIS TOXIC-WASTE DUMP.

179
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,000
ONE BOX IS MISSING.

180
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,900
GREAT.

181
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,300
WELL, MAYBE
THEY DIDN'T OPEN IT.

182
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,500
COME ON, MAN.
LET'S OPEN IT.

183
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
SHUT UP
ABOUT THE DAMN BOX!

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,500
DO YOU SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

185
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,200
I'M LITERALLY BLEEDING
TO DEATH.

186
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
- I'M GONNA OPEN IT.
- GROSSMAN...

187
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,300
LOOK, WHAT IF THIS
IS REALLY WORTH SOMETHING?

188
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,800
WHAT, WE SHOULD
JUST HAND IT OVER TO <i>HER?</i>

189
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,700
WE TOOK ALL THE RISK.

190
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
HELL, WAYNE, 

191
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,200
YOU GOT SHOT,

192
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,600
AND ALL FOR A LOUSY
FEW HUNDRED BUCKS.

193
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,600
NOW, WE COULD MAKE MORE SELLING
WHATEVER IT IS OURSELVES.

194
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,700
HUH?

195
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,400
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

196
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,700
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

197
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,200
IT'S A RABBIT'S FOOT.

198
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,300
IT'S A RABBIT'S FOOT,
GROSSMAN!

199
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I'M GONNA DIE
FOR A DAMN RABBIT'S FOOT.

200
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
OH.

201
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
HEY, FOSTER.

202
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,600
HEY, LISTEN, GUYS,
NOT TO BE A DRAG OR NOTHING,

203
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,800
BUT IT'S 6:00 IN THE MORNING.

204
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,700
- RIGHT.
- CAN'T YOU GUYS KEEP IT DOWN?

205
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,300
NO, WE JUST GOT A SITUATION HERE IS ALL. 
SORRY.

206
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,000
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO YOU?

207
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,600
A SHOTGUN HAPPENED TO ME.

208
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
- HEY, GROSSMAN, 
- YEAH?

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,800
UNDER MY SINK,
THERE'S A MEDICAL KIT.

210
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,500
AND GET SOME WATER BOILING.

211
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,000
I USED TO BE AN ARMY MEDIC,
YOU KNOW, IN NAM.

212
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,700
SO, I GUESS
THIS IS YOUR LUCKY DAY.

213
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,100
CONNECTICUT.

214
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,900
LAST THREE DIGITS 8-8-0.

215
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,900
YEP. THAT'S IT.

216
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,600
SHOULD HAVE BLACKED OUT
THEIR PLATES

217
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
BEFORE THEY PARKED IN FRONT OF
THE SECURITY CAMERA.

218
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
FOUR KINGS.

219
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
YOU SEE THAT?

220
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,300
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

221
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
DEAL IT UP AGAIN.

222
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
ROYAL FLUSH.

223
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,500
GROSSMAN, THAT'S THE SECOND
ROYAL FLUSH IN EIGHT HANDS.

224
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,300
I CAN'T LOSE.

225
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,100
I MEAN, REALLY,
I-I <i>CAN'T</i> LOSE.

226
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
I THINK THIS THING
REALLY WORKS.

227
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,800
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

228
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,300
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING --
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL

229
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
WE ARE HANDING IT OVER
TO THAT STUCK-UP BITCH.

230
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,900
- FREEZE! - FREEZE!

231
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,700
NOBODY MOVE!

232
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,100
- DON'T MOVE.
- DON'T MOVE!

233
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,400
- WHAT IS IT?
- STOP!

234
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
ALL RIGHT.
GIVE US THE BOX.

235
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,400
 <i>PLEASE</i> TELL ME
THAT YOU DIDN'T --

236
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
OH, THEY DID.

237
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
YOU OPENED IT?!

238
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
ARE YOU GUYS COPS?

239
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,700
- HUH?
- ARE YOU GUYS COPS?!

240
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,000
WHAT WAS IN THE BOX?

241
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,400
OH, WAS THAT IT, HUH?
IT <i>WAS,</i> WASN'T IT?

242
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
WHAT IS THAT THING?

243
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,000
SORRY.

244
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,800
DEAN...

245
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,400
I GOT IT.

246
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
NO, YOU DON'T.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,800
DAMN!

248
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,300
WHOA!

249
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,900
SAM!

250
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
THAT'S A LUCKY BREAK.

251
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,100
IS THAT A RABBIT'S FOOT?

252
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,000
I THINK IT IS.

253
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,400
HUH.

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,100
I'M NOT FINDING ANYTHING ON IT
IN DAD'S JOURNAL.

255
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,500
- DEAN, COME ON.
- WHAT?

256
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,600
HEY, THAT WAS <i>MY</i> GUN
HE WAS AIMING AT YOUR HEAD.

257
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
AND MY GUN DON'T JAM,
SO THAT WAS A LUCKY BREAK.

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
NOT TO MENTION THEM TAKING <i>THEMSELVES</i> OUT --
 <i>ALSO</i> A LUCKY BREAK.

259
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,100
HERE. SCRATCH ONE.

260
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
COME ON, SAM.

261
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,400
SCRATCH AND WIN.

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
LOOK, DEAN, IT'S GOT TO BE
CURSED SOMEHOW.

263
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,900
OTHERWISE, DAD WOULDN'T HAVE
LOCKED IT UP.

264
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,500
$1,200.

265
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,600
YOU JUST WON $1,200.

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
WHOO!

267
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT CURSED TO ME.

268
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,300
GROSSMAN?

269
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,800
GROSSMAN, GET UP.

270
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,600
HEY...

271
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,300
GROSSMAN, GET UP.

272
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,200
HEY.

273
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
HEY...

274
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,300
GROSSMAN?

275
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,200
OH.

276
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,000
AHHH!

277
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,600
OH, MAN.

278
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,300
NOW, LOOK, BOBBY,
WE DIDN'T KNOW.

279
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,300
You touched it?
Damn it, Sam.

280
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,000
WELL, DAD NEVER TOLD US
ABOUT THIS THING.

281
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,600
I MEAN, YOU KNEW ABOUT
A STORAGE PLACE IN BLACK ROCK?

282
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,100
HIS LOCKUP?
YEAH, I KNEW.

283
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,200
HELL, I BUILT
THOSE CURSE BOXES FOR HIM.

284
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,700
Listen, you have got
a serious problem.

285
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,300
THAT RABBIT'S FOOT
AIN'T NO DIME-STORE NOTION.

286
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,200
It's real hoodoo --
old-world stuff.

287
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,700
MADE BY A BATON ROUGE CONJURE
WOMAN ABOUT 100 YEARS AGO.

288
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,300
IT'S A HELL
OF A LUCK CHARM.

289
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,200
IT'S NOT A <i>LUCK</i> CHARM.
IT'S A CURSE.

290
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,100
SHE MADE IT
TO KILL PEOPLE, SAM.

291
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,100
See, 

292
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,500
you touch it,
you own it.

293
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,400
You own it, sure, you get a run
of good luck to beat the devil.

294
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,300
But...

295
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,800
YOU LOSE IT,
THAT LUCK TURNS.

296
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,800
IT TURNS SO BAD
THAT YOU'RE DEAD INSIDE A WEEK.

297
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,200
SO, I WON'T LOSE IT, BOBBY.

298
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,700
EVERYBODY LOSES IT!

299
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,500
WELL, THEN, HOW DO WE BREAK THE CURSE?

300
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,000
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN.

301
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,200
Let me look through my library
and make some calls.

302
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,200
JUST SIT TIGHT.

303
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,100
DUDE, 

304
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
WE'RE UP 15 GRAND.

305
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,500
DON'T WORRY.

306
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,100
BOBBY WILL FIND A WAY
TO BREAK IT.

307
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,900
TILL THEN, I SAY WE HIT VEGAS,
PULL A LITTLE "RAIN MAN."

308
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,900
YOU CAN BE RAIN MAN.

309
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,300
WE JUST LAY LOW
UNTIL BOBBY CALLS BACK, OKAY?

310
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,100
HI. UH,
TABLE FOR TWO, PLEASE.

311
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,500
CONGRATULATIONS!

312
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,700
SAY THAT AGAIN?

313
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,100
YOU ARE THE ONE MILLIONTH GUEST
OF THE BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT FAMILY.

314
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,200
RIGHT. IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING,
GIVE ME A CALL.

315
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,700
WELL, THAT CLEARS MY BOOK.

316
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,200
THE WORD'S OUT.

317
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,800
NOW WE WAIT.

318
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,300
NOW WE EAT.

319
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
GOOD IDEA.

320
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,900
WHAT DO YOU LIKE?
I GOT CANNED EVERYTHING.

321
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,600
NO, NO, MAN.
NOT EATING IN THE R.V.

322
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,200
LOOK, I KNOW A GOOD PLACE.

323
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,600
WIDE MENU, GOOD SERVICE,
HOMEY ATMOSPHERE...

324
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
GARLIC KNOTS.

325
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
THE MENU'S
ON THEIR WEBSITE.

326
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,700
BOBBY'S RIGHT.

327
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,700
THIS LORE GOES <i>WAY</i> BACK.

328
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
PURE HOODOO.

329
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
YOU CAN'T JUST CUT ONE
OFF ANY RABBIT.

330
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,800
IT HAS TO BE IN A CEMETERY

331
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,600
UNDER A FULL MOON 
ON A FRIDAY THE 13th.

332
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,900
I THINK FROM NOW ON,

333
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,300
WE ONLY GO TO PLACES
WITH BIGGERSON'S.

334
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,800
CAN I FRESHEN YOU UP?

335
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,400
YEAH. YEAH, SURE.

336
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,800
THANKS.

337
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
- OH.
- OH.

338
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,200
OH, I -- NO, DON'T WORRY.
THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S -- I GOT IT.

339
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,600
IT'S NO TROUBLE, REALLY.

340
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,800
OKAY.

341
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

342
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

343
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,800
DUDE, 

344
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,900
IF YOU WERE
 <i>EVER</i> GONNA GET LUCKY...

345
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,700
CHILL OUT.

346
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,100
OH! OH, JEEZ!

347
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
SORRY.

348
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,500
HOW WAS THAT GOOD?

349
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,000
SON OF A BITCH.

350
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,700
COME ON.

351
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,900
WHOA!

352
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
WOW. 

353
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
YOU SUCK.

354
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,900
SO, WHAT,
NOW YOUR LUCK TURNS BAD?

355
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,300
I GUESS.

356
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,600
I WONDER <i>HOW</i> BAD.

357
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,300
LOOKS GOOD.

358
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,600
I LIKE THAT WHEN THEY DROP
THE WHOLE ONION IN THE FRYER.

359
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,400
NEAREST LOCATION...

360
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,700
YOU SEEING THAT?

361
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,400
YES, I AM.

362
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,300
???

363
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,300
OH, MAN.

364
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,200
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

365
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,500
HEARD ABOUT YOUR FRIEND.

366
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
IT'S BAD LUCK.

367
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,700
PISS OFF.

368
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,000
WE KNOW SOMEONE HIRED YOU
TO STEAL THE RABBIT'S FOOT --

369
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,800
A WOMAN.

370
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,900
YEAH?

371
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,900
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

372
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
BECAUSE SHE JUST STOLE IT
BACK FROM <i>US.</i>

373
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,500
LISTEN, MAN, THIS IS --

374
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
SAM, YOU OKAY?

375
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,300
YEAH. I'M GOOD.

376
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,700
I WANT YOU
TO TELL US HER NAME.

377
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,900
SCREW YOU.

378
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,800
IT WASN'T A FREAK ACCIDENT
THAT KILLED YOUR PARTNER.

379
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,300
WHAT?

380
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,800
IT WAS THE RABBIT'S FOOT.

381
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,300
YOU'RE CRAZY, MAN.

382
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
YOU KNOW I'M NOT.

383
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,600
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED,
WHAT IT DID --

384
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,400
ALL THE FLUKES,
ALL THE LUCK.

385
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,100
WHEN YOU LOSE THE FOOT,
THAT LUCK GOES SOUR.

386
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
 <i>THAT'S</i> WHAT KILLED
YOUR FRIEND.

387
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,600
AND MY BROTHER HERE IS NEXT,

388
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,300
AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY MORE
INNOCENT PEOPLE AFTER THAT.

389
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,500
NOW, IF YOU DON'T HELP US
STOP THIS THING,

390
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,400
THEN THAT PUTS THOSE DEATHS
ON YOUR HEAD.

391
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,900
NOW, I CAN READ PEOPLE...

392
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,800
AND I GET IT.

393
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,100
YOU'RE A THIEF AND A SCUMBAG.

394
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,000
THAT'S FINE.

395
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,800
BUT YOU'RE NOT A KILLER...

396
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,500
ARE YOU?

397
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,200
NO ONE
SAW WHICH WAY THEY WENT,

398
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,600
AND THEIR MEAL WAS FREE,
SO THERE'S NO CREDIT-CARD TRAIL.

399
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,000
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIND THEM.

400
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,500
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

401
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,500
'CAUSE THERE'S A HIGHER POWER
AT WORK HERE.

402
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,300
I KNOW IT NOW.

403
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
HELLO.

404
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,500
Dean, great news.

405
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,900
Wasn't easy, but I found a heavyweight 
cleansing ritual that should do the trick.

406
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,900
BOBBY, THAT'S, UH, GREAT,
EXCEPT SAM, UH...

407
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,200
...SAM LOST THE FOOT.

408
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,300
HE WHAT?

409
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,200
BOBBY, LISTEN, LISTEN.

410
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,400
THIS HOT CHICK
STOLE IT FROM HIM.

411
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,600
I'M SERIOUS.

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,900
IN HER MID-20s,
AND SHE WAS SHARP, YOU KNOW?

413
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,600
GOOD ENOUGH OF A CON
TO PLAY US.

414
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
AND SHE ONLY GAVE
THE GUYS SHE HIRED A NAME --

415
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,400
PROBABLY AN ALIAS
OR SOMETHING.

416
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,900
LUIGI OR SOMETHING.

417
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,300
LUGOSI.

418
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Lugosi?

419
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
LUGOSI.

420
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,500
OH, CRAP.
IT'S PROBABLY BELA.

421
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,000
BELA LUGOSI?
THAT'S CUTE.

422
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,800
Bela Talbot's
her <i>real</i> name.

423
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,900
CROSSED PATHS WITH HER
ONCE OR TWICE.

424
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,700
SHE KNEW ABOUT THE RABBIT'S FOOT. 
IS SHE A HUNTER?

425
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,500
PRETTY FRIGGIN' FAR
FROM A HUNTER,

426
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,400
BUT SHE KNOWS HER WAY
AROUND THE TERRITORY.

427
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,700
SHE'S BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

428
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,000
Last I heard, she was
in the Middle East someplace.

429
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,500
I GUESS SHE'S BACK.

430
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,300
WHICH MEANS
SERIOUSLY BAD LUCK FOR YOU.

431
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,400
GREAT.

432
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,500
But if it <i>is</i> Bela,

433
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,600
AT LEAST I MIGHT KNOW SOME FOLKS
WHO KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER.

434
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,200
THANKS, BOBBY, AGAIN.

435
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,700
JUST LOOK OUT
FOR YOUR BROTHER, YOU IDJIT.

436
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,800
WHAT?

437
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,600
I LOST MY SHOE.

438
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,300
ALL RIGHT, BOBBY, THANKS.
HEY, WE OWE YOU...ANOTHER ONE.

439
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,900
ALL RIGHT, BOBBY'S GOT IT
ON PRETTY GOOD AUTHORITY

440
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,500
THAT THIS BELA CHICK
LIVES IN QUEENS.

441
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
SO IT WILL TAKE ME
ABOUT TWO HOURS TO GET THERE.

442
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,300
SO, WHAT ARE WE DOING THEN?

443
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,200
YOU, MY BROTHER,
ARE STAYING HERE,

444
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
YOUR BAD LUCK GETTING US KILLED.

445
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,300
WHAT AM I EVEN
SUPPOSED TO DO, DEAN?

446
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,900
NOTHING. NOTHING.
COME HERE.

447
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,100
I DON'T WANT YOU
DOING <i>ANYTHING.</i>

448
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,500
I WANT YOU TO SIT RIGHT HERE

449
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,500
AND DON'T MOVE, OKAY?

450
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,800
DON'T TURN ON THE LIGHT.
DON'T TURN <i>OFF</i> THE LIGHT.

451
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,600
DON'T EVEN
SCRATCH YOUR NOSE.

452
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,400
BECAUSE YOU SHOOK ON 1.5.

453
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

454
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,400
DON'T THREATEN ME, LUKE.

455
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,400
DESPITE YOUR REPUTATION,
YOU DON'T SCARE ME.

456
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,200
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU SEE IT THAT WAY.

457
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,300
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE AIRSTRIP
IN AN HOUR.

458
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,100
???

459
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
OH, COME ON. I--

460
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,400
I DIDN'T --

461
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,500
AH!

462
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,600
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE IT BACK.

463
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,100
SWEETIE, 

464
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
NO, I'M NOT.

465
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
YEAH? WE'LL SEE.

466
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,900
BELA, RIGHT?

467
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,200
THAT'S RIGHT...

468
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,800
DEAN.

469
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,400
YOU KNOW THE THING'S CURSED,
DON'T YOU?

470
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,600
YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT SOME PEOPLE 
WOULD PAY FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

471
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,300
REALLY?

472
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,900
THERE'S A LUCRATIVE MARKET
OUT THERE.

473
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,000
A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE.

474
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,300
YOU HUNTERS, WITH ALL THOSE AMULETS 
AND TALISMANS YOU USE

475
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,900
TO STOP THOSE BIG,
BAD MONSTERS --

476
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,100
ANY ONE OF THEM COULD PUT YOUR CHILDREN'S
CHILDREN THROUGH COLLEGE.

477
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,500
SO, YOU KNOW THE TRUTH

478
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,900
ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON
OUT THERE,

479
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DECIDE
TO DO WITH IT?

480
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,300
YOU BECOME A THIEF.

481
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,300
I PROCURE UNIQUE ITEMS
FOR A SELECT CLIENTELE.

482
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,300
YEAH. 

483
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
A THIEF.

484
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,700
NO. 

485
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,400
A <i>GREAT</i> THIEF.

486
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,200
OH, HE'S AWAKE.

487
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,100
BACK WITH US, EH?

488
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,900
WE DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE TO TOUCH YOU.

489
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,900
???
AND KNOCKED YOURSELF OUT.

490
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,000
IT WAS LIKE WATCHING JERRY LEWIS
TRYING TO STACK CHAIRS.

491
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,500
WHO ARE YOU?

492
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,200
WHAT DO YOU WAN--

493
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,800
I USED TO THINK YOUR FRIEND
GORDON SENT ME...

494
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,300
GORDON?

495
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,200
OH, COME ON.

496
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,400
...BECAUSE HE ASKED ME
TO TRACK YOU DOWN

497
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,800
AND PUT A BULLET
IN YOUR BRAIN.

498
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,100
GREAT.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE HIM.

499
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,800
BUT 

500
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
AS IT TURNS OUT...

501
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,900
I'M ON A MISSION FROM GOD.

502
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,500
LOOK, BELA.

503
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,800
MY BROTHER, HE...
TOUCHED THE FOOT.

504
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,800
AND WHEN YOU TOOK IT FROM HIM,
HIS LUCK WENT FROM --

505
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,400
I KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

506
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,000
SO, THEN YOU KNOW HE'S GONNA DIE
UNLESS WE CAN DESTROY IT.

507
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
OH.

508
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,600
YOU CAN HAVE THE FOOT...

509
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,100
FOR $1.5 MILLION.

510
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,000
NICE.

511
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,900
YEAH.
I'LL JUST CALL MY BANKER.

512
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,300
HOW'D YOU EVEN FIND
THE DAMN THING,

513
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,400
STUCK IN THE BACK
OF SOME STORAGE PLACE,

514
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?

515
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I JUST ASKED A FEW OF THE GHOSTS
OF THE PEOPLE IT HAD KILLED.

516
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,900
THEY WERE VERY TUNED IN
TO ITS LOCATION.

517
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,600
SO YOU'RE ONLY
AFTER YOURSELF, HUH?

518
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,900
IT'S ALL ABOUT NUMBER ONE.

519
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,500
BEING A HUNTER
IS SO MUCH MORE NOBLE?

520
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,100
A BUNCH OF OBSESSED,
REVENGE-DRIVEN SOCIOPATHS

521
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
TRYING TO SAVE A WORLD
THAT CAN'T BE SAVED.

522
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,800
WELL, AREN'T YOU
A GLASS HALF FULL.

523
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,000
WE'RE ALL GOING TO HELL, DEAN.

524
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,300
MIGHT AS WELL ENJOY THE RIDE.

525
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,900
I ACTUALLY
AGREE WITH YOU THERE.

526
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,400
ANYHOO, THIS HAS BEEN CHARMING,
BUT, UH, LOOK AT THE TIME.

527
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,600
OH, AND...

528
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,600
THIS.

529
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,100
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH STICKY FINGERS.

530
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,500
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION, I THINK
YOU'RE A TRULY <i>AWFUL</i> PERSON.

531
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,200
YOU WERE A PART OF THAT DEMON PLAN
TO OPEN THE GATE, WEREN'T YOU?

532
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,500
WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD
TO STOP IT.

533
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,000
LIE, LIE, LIE!

534
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,100
YOU WERE IN ON IT.

535
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,200
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE NEXT MOVE
IS, TOO, DON'T YOU?

536
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,000
NO, I DON'T, OKAY?
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

537
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,800
WHERE ARE THEY GONNA
HIT US NEXT?

538
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,800
WHERE?!

539
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,800
GORDON
TOLD ME ABOUT YOU, SAM,

540
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
ABOUT YOUR POWERS.

541
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
YOU'RE SOME KIND OF
WEIRDO PSYCHIC FREAK.

542
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
NO, NOT ANYMORE.

543
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I HAVE NO POWERS,
NO VISIONS -- NOTHING.

544
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,900
- IT JUST --
- LIE!

545
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,900
NOW NO MORE LIES.

546
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,100
THERE'S AN ARMY OF DEMONS
OUT THERE,

547
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,400
PUSHING AT A WORLD
ALREADY ON THE BRINK.

548
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,000
WE'RE ON DECK
FOR THE END GAME HERE, RIGHT?

549
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,600
SO MAYBE, 

550
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,000
JUST MAYBE
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

551
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,300
WHY WE CAN'T TAKE CHANCES.

552
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,400
WHOA! OKAY, OKAY.

553
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
- NOW, HOLD ON A MINUTE.
- KUBRICK, GET...

554
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,200
NO! YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED, CREEDIE.

555
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,600
ASK YOURSELF --

556
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,500
WHY ARE WE HERE?

557
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,100
BECAUSE YOU SAW A PICTURE
ON THE WEB?

558
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,300
BECAUSE WE CHOSE <i>THIS</i> MOTEL
INSTEAD OF ANOTHER?

559
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,000
LUCK LIKE THAT
DOESN'T JUST <i>HAPPEN.</i>

560
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,200
LOOK, I CAN EXPLAIN
ALL OF THAT.

561
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
SHUT UP.

562
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,300
IT'S GOD, CREEDIE.

563
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,300
HE LED US HERE
FOR ONE REASON --

564
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,100
TO DO HIS WORK.

565
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,700
THIS IS DESTINY.

566
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,600
WHOA.

567
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,800
NO.

568
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
NO DESTINY.

569
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,900
JUST A RABBIT'S FOOT.

570
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,100
PUT THE GUN DOWN, SON,

571
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,300
OR YOU'RE GONNA BE
SCRAPING BRAIN OFF THE WALL.

572
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,700
OH, THIS THING?

573
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
YEAH, THAT THING.

574
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,200
OKAY.

575
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,300
BUT, YOU SEE, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT ME THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

576
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,700
YEAH? WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

577
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
IT'S MY LUCKY DAY.

578
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,200
OH, MY GOD!
DID YOU SEE THAT SHOT?!

579
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,900
I'M AMAZING.

580
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,900
I'M BATMAN.

581
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
YEAH. 

582
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,800
YOU'RE BATMAN.

583
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,700
ALL RIGHT.

584
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,200
BONE ASH, 

585
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,800
CAYENNE PEPPER.

586
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,000
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

587
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
ONE SECOND.

588
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:52,900
DEAN --

589
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,400
HEY, BACK OFF, JINX.

590
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,100
I'M BRINGING HOME THE BACON.

591
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
ALL RIGHT.

592
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,900
SAY GOODBYE TO "WASCAWY WABBIT."

593
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,400
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
THAT BELONGS TO ME.

594
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,200
OR, YOU KNOW...

595
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,000
WHATEVER.

596
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,900
PUT THE FOOT DOWN, HONEY.

597
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,700
NO.

598
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,700
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA SHOOT ANYBODY.

599
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,400
SEE, I HAPPEN TO BE ABLE
TO READ PEOPLE.

600
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
OKAY, YOU'RE A THIEF. FINE.
BUT YOU'RE NOT --

601
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,600
OH!

602
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,000
SON OF A --

603
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,900
BACK OFF, TIGER.

604
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,800
BACK OFF.

605
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
YOU MAKE ONE MORE MOVE,
AND I'LL PULL THE TRIGGER.

606
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,800
YOU'VE GOT THE LUCK, DEAN.
YOU I CAN'T HIT.

607
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
BUT YOUR BROTHER --

608
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,800
HIM I CAN'T MISS.

609
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,800
THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH YOU?!

610
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
YOU DON'T JUST DO AROUND
SHOOTING PEOPLE LIKE THAT!

611
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
RELAX.

612
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,100
IT'S A SHOULDER HIT.
I CAN AIM.

613
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,200
BESIDES, 

614
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
WHO HERE
 <i>HASN'T</i> SHOT A FEW PEOPLE?

615
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,000
PUT THE RABBIT'S FOOT
ON THE GROUND NOW.

616
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,900
ALL RIGHT!

617
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,000
ALL RIGHT.

618
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
TAKE IT EASY.

619
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,500
THINK FAST.

620
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,500
DAMN.

621
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,600
NOW, 

622
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,100
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE DESTROY 
THAT UGLY-ASS PIECE OF DEAD THING?

623
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,100
THANKS VERY MUCH.

624
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,300
I'M OUT $1.5 MILLION

625
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,700
AND ON THE BAD SIDE OF A VERY POWERFUL,
FAIRLY PSYCHOTIC BUYER.

626
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
WOW.

627
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,900
I REALLY DON'T FEEL BAD
ABOUT THAT.

628
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,800
SAM?

629
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,700
NO.

630
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,500
NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

631
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,100
MAYBE NEXT TIME,

632
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,400
I'LL HANG <i>YOU</i> OUT TO DRY.

633
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,500
OH, DON'T GO AWAY ANGRY.
JUST GO AWAY.

634
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,500
HAVE A NICE NIGHT, BOYS.

635
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,800
YOU GOOD?

636
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
I'LL LIVE.

637
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,800
I GUESS WE'RE BACK
TO NORMAL NOW, HUH?

638
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,600
NO GOOD LUCK.

639
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,900
NO BAD LUCK.

640
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,700
OH, 

641
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,200
I FORGOT.
WE'RE AT $46,000.

642
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THE...

643
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,500
SCRATCH TICKETS.

644
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,400
SON OF A BITCH!

645
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,400
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

646
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,900
SAM WINCHESTER
IS MORE THAN A MONSTER.

647
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,500
HE'S THE ADVERSARY.

648
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,700
AND WHAT WAS IT
THAT CONVINCED YOU?

649
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
GOD LED ME TO HIM...

650
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
AND HIS WILL IS CLEAR.

651
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,300
OKAY.

652
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,900
THAT'S GREAT.

653
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
I'M GLAD
TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD.

654
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
BUT, UH, FIRST THINGS FIRST.

655
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,600
WE GOT TO GET ME
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

656
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,200
'CAUSE LIKE I TOLD YOU
BEFORE,

657
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,200
SAM WINCHESTER MUST DIE.
