1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,225
Dad's gone now

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,925
He wants us to pick
up where he left off.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,810
What do you say we kill
some evil sons of bitches

4
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:05,790
And we raise a little hell?

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,675
Sam: Bobby,that knife -

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,155
What kind of blade
could kill a demon?

7
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,450
Bobby: yesterdd have said
there was no such thing.

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,740
It won't stop a demon
if that's what you think.

9
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:17,420
Who are you?

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,815
That smarts a little. What do you want?

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,760
Do you want me to help you
out with that gun or not?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,020
Dean: and the second you find
out this Ruby chick is a demon

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,345
You go for the holy water.

14
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,325
You don't chat. No
one was chatting,Dean.

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,300
Then why didn't you send
her ass back to hell?

16
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:34,715
She told me she could help you,okay?

17
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,355
She knows what your
weakness is. It's me.

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,470
Think something's wrong with
my brother? No. Demons lie.

19
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:42,510
Last I checked, Dean's
still going to hell.

20
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:44,590
Everything in its own time,Sam.

21
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:45,985
You're gonna have to do things

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,280
That go against that
gentle nature of yours.

23
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,540
On the bright side,
I'll be there with you -

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,410
That little fallen
angel on your shoulder.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,650
That was just a
terrible, terrible party.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,690
But there was this one
really beautiful woman there.

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,370
You should have gone home with her.

28
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,820
I did.

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,480
I need a few minutes.

30
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:35,120
All right.

31
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,920
There's a bottle of '89 in the fridge.

32
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,760
Oh,god.

33
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,360
What the...

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,380
Paul!

35
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,510
What is it? It's my teeth.

36
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,110
Janet?!

37
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,430
Help me!

38
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:30,250
Www. 1000fr. Com

39
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,150
She was so scared...

40
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,100
I couldn't help. I couldn't
do anything to stop it.

41
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,255
I
- I've talked to the police

42
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,130
And I've talked to the medical examiner

43
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:43,505
And no one can explain it.

44
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,680
That's why they put the
call into us,Mr. Dutton.

45
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,345
But the CDC
- That's disease control,right?

46
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,340
W- What do you think -
It's some kind of virus?

47
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,860
We're not ruling out anything yet.

48
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,890
Mr. Dutton, did Janet have
any enemies? I'm sorry?

49
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:57,835
Anyone that had a reason to hurt her?

50
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,210
Wait... what are you saying
- That somebody poisoned her?

51
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,660
I'm just saying we have
to cover every base here.

52
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:06,275
I mean, what kind of poison?

53
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,610
You think a person
could have done this?

54
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:09,520
Would anyone want to?

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,010
What? No.

56
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,150
No,there's no one that could have...

57
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,000
Mr. Dutton?

58
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,000
Uh,everyone loved Janet.

59
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,590
Okay. Thank you very much.

60
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,620
I think we got everything we need.

61
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:31,300
We'll be out of your way now.

62
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,130
That dude seem a little evasive to you?

63
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:39,575
I don't know.

64
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,140
I was under a sink... pulling this out.

65
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:43,910
Hex bag.

66
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,380
Ohh,gross. Yeah.

67
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,375
Bird bones,rabbit's teeth.

68
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,805
This cloth was probably cut

69
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,380
From something Janet Dutton owned.

70
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,750
So we're thinking witch?

71
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:54,870
Uh,yeah.

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,870
And not some new-Age
wiccan water douser,either.

73
00:04:57,905 --> 00:05:00,010
This is old-World black magic,Dean,

74
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:01,470
I mean,warts and all.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,090
I hate witches.

76
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,270
They're always spewing their
bodily fluids everywhere.

77
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:13,712
Pretty much. It's creepy.

78
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,085
It's downright unsanitary.

79
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,975
Yeah,well,someone definitely
had it out for Janet Dutton.

80
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,830
Yeah,someone who snuck into
that house and planted the bag.

81
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:22,025
So,what are we thinking? We are...

82
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,210
Looking for some craggy old
blair bitch in the woods?

83
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:25,125
No,it could be anyone -

84
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,285
A neighbor,coworker, man,woman.

85
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,360
They're human. They're
like everyone else.

86
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,410
Great. How are we gonna find them?

87
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,800
This wasn't random.

88
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,800
Someone in Janet Dutton's
life had an ugly ax to grind.

89
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,195
We find the motive...

90
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,770
We find the murderer. Yeah.

91
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,270
Amanda?

92
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey,Amanda!

93
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,170
Oh,Elizabeth,hi.

94
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,980
Sorry,I've got,like, a
thousand things on my mind.

95
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,700
Are you okay,sweetie?

96
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,880
You didn't come to book club last night.

97
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,442
Yeah,sorry. I was gonna call.

98
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:12,970
I just
- I got busy,you know?

99
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,000
But I'm fine,really. I am. Thanks.

100
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,280
This dinner was cooked for
you, Paul Arthur Dutton.

101
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,830
Now you're going to eat it.

102
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,210
Check the car

103
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,190
Sam

104
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,900
Got it!

105
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,025
You okay?

106
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,835
What the hell is happening to me?

107
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,540
Someone murdered your wife.
Now they're trying to kill you.

108
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:11,815
That's impossible. There's no way -

109
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,510
If we hadn't been following
you, you'd be a doornail.

110
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,910
Now,who wants you dead?

111
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,910
I
- Come on,think.

112
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,185
There's a woman.

113
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,095
Okay,a woman.

114
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,855
An affair,a-A mistake.

115
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,545
She was unbalanced.

116
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,900
She was blackmailing me. I
put an end to it a week ago.

117
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:27,865
What's her name? Wha-

118
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,360
What could she have to do with what -

119
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:30,510
Paul,what is her name?

120
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,350
That's a curveball.

121
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,890
Yeah.

122
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,530
Three per wrist
- Vertical.

123
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,870
She wasn't fooling around.

124
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,580
Yeah,looks like she was working
some heavyweight evil here.

125
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,600
Yep.

126
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,830
Freaking witches!
Seriously,man! Come on!

127
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,810
Guess we know where she
got the rabbit's teeth from.

128
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,505
Paul knows how to pick 'em.

129
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,040
It's like "fatal
attraction" all over again.

130
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,930
Why's the rabbit always
get screwed in the deal?

131
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,470
Poor little guy.

132
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,740
You know what I don't get, Dean?

133
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,410
If she was so bent on
revenge, why do this?

134
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,365
Well,she got Janet Dutton,

135
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,670
Thought she finished off Paul,

136
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,215
Decided to cap herself

137
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,810
And make it a spurned lover's hat trick.

138
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,830
Maybe.

139
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,245
This doesn't exactly look like a tv room

140
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,120
Of a bright and stable person, you know?

141
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,090
No.

142
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,220
But then...

143
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,560
...there's this.

144
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,160
Another hex g? Come on.

145
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,225
Looks like we got a hit,huh?

146
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,150
A little
witch-On-Witch violence.

147
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,350
I guess.

148
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,920
I'd like to report a dead
body at 309 mayfair circle.

149
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,210
My name? Yeah,sure,my name is...

150
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,010
Why are witches ganking each other?

151
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,950
I don't know,but I think maybe
we got a coven on our hands.

152
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,970
All right,all right. I'm going.

153
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,215
I'm not fooled by your
little book club,by the way.

154
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,390
I know what you ladies
get up to when I'm gone.

155
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,430
It's all dish and gossip.

156
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,035
Hi,Ron.

157
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,510
Oh,hello,Elizabeth.

158
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,180
I mean,when's the last time
anyone actually brought a book?

159
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,030
Good night,Ron. Good night,Ron.

160
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,570
All right.

161
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,890
He doesn't know? You didn't tell him?

162
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,540
About Amanda?

163
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,330
I think that's book
club business,don't you?

164
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,520
Thank you,Tammi.

165
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,080
The police just took away her body,

166
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,910
And we're just gonna
pretend it didn't happen?

167
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,820
He loved Amanda.

168
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,370
It's true.

169
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,640
We know that she was
a little... unstable.

170
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,240
Also true.

171
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,565
And we have to face it -

172
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,380
She probably killed Janet Dutton.

173
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,170
People just don't spit out
their teeth all of a sudden.

174
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,640
We have to stop.

175
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,890
We have to stop book club.
This has all gone too far.

176
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,870
Elizabeth, just take a deep breath.

177
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:50,510
Calm down.

178
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,675
We can't stop.

179
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,960
But people are dying.

180
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,625
Amanda killed herself, yes.

181
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,900
And,yes, she killed Janet.

182
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,660
Awful, awful business,of course,

183
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:05,490
But that's all over now.

184
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,790
And think about what book
club has gotten us,hmm?

185
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,620
Your husband's promotion,

186
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,450
That little trip to hawaii that you won.

187
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,530
And what about me?

188
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,110
My home pottery business
is finally taking off,

189
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:23,880
And you want to just stop?

190
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,350
Do you want to stop?

191
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,700
Okay. Now,come on. We
don't have much time.

192
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,220
Ron gets back from his
fantasy football in an hour.

193
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,920
Let us serve your
master as you serve us.

194
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,410
Book of shadows, we kneel before you.

195
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,800
Let us serve your master...

196
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,660
Sam: you must have a green thumb.

197
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,090
Excuse me?

198
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,380
Getting these herbs to grow
out of season like this.

199
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,310
Quite impressive.

200
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,580
I'm sorry. I should have
introduced myself first.

201
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,080
I'm,uh,detective Bachman,
and this is detective Turner.

202
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,180
Hiya.

203
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,540
We're following up on
Amanda burns' death.

204
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,650
Going around the neighborhood,
talking to her neighbors.

205
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:27,180
But didn't she
- I mean, she killed herself,right?

206
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,900
Maybe,maybe. We heard you were
friends with the deceased,right?

207
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,790
Yeah,I guess so.

208
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,470
Do you have any idea
about her practices?

209
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,430
I'm sorry? What
- What kind of practices?

210
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,090
Well,her house was littered
with satanic paraphernalia.

211
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,540
It was a regular black sabbath.

212
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,750
No,th
- But she was an episcopalian.

213
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,750
Well, then we're pretty sure

214
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,890
She was using the wrong bible.

215
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,280
Renee: Elizabeth.

216
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,340
Are you all right?

217
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,380
I'm fine. Uh,Renee,
these are detectives.

218
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,160
They say Amanda was
- She was practicing -

219
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,110
Sorry,detectives.

220
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,830
You can tell that
Elizabeth is a little upset.

221
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,990
Of course,miss...

222
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,690
Mrs. Renee Van Allen.

223
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,720
Would you like me to spell it for you?

224
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,410
I'll get by,thanks.

225
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,180
This Amanda business
has been hard for Liz,

226
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,200
For all of us.

227
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,040
Yeah,I mean, you think
you know a person.

228
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,480
Well,I guess we all
have secrets,don't we?

229
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,360
Well,thanks. Um,we'll be in touch.

230
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,680
Have a nice day.

231
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,330
Bye.

232
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,550
Well,I'm already sold
on that Elizabeth chick.

233
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,370
Did you see that
victory garden of hers?

234
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,440
Belladonna,wolfsbane, mandrake.

235
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,920
Not to mention that
little flinch she threw

236
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:06,930
When we mentioned the occult.

237
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,870
Well,she's definitely
had a good run lately.

238
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,300
Gone up a few tax brackets,
won almost too many raffles -

239
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,410
The kind of thing a litt
black magic always helps with.

240
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,110
Yeah.

241
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,380
I don't think she's alone,either.

242
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,000
It looks like mrs. Renee Van Allen

243
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,030
Has won almost every
craft contest she's entered

244
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,140
In the past three months.

245
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,940
A regular martha stewart,huh?

246
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,210
Except for the devil worship.

247
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,560
I'm thinking that was the
coven we met back there,

248
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,440
Minus one member.

249
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,210
Amanda was clearly going
off the reservation.

250
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,480
You think they killed her
to keep up appearances?

251
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,720
Seems like an appearance
kind of crowd,don't you think?

252
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:40,440
Yeah.

253
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,820
If they killed a nut job,
should we thank them or what?

254
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,840
They work in black magic,too,Dean.

255
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,700
They need to be stopped.

256
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,840
Stopped,like stopped?

257
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,620
They're human,Sam.

258
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,110
They're murderers.

259
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,620
Burn,witch,burn.

260
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,090
What the hell...

261
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,040
Ruby.

262
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,210
Sam,listen to me. There's no time.

263
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,410
What are you talking about?
You have to get out of town.

264
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,250
So,this is Ruby,huh?

265
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,160
Never had the pleasure.

266
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,120
Dean. I was hoping you'd show up again.

267
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,970
Point that thing somewhere else.

268
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,140
Ha ha ha ha. Right.

269
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,350
Sam,please. Go.

270
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,940
Get in the car and don't look back.

271
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,270
Why? I don't understand.

272
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,930
Hey,hot stuff, we can take care

273
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,130
Of a few kitchen witches, thanks.

274
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,130
I'm not talking about
witches, you jackass.

275
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,220
Witches are whores.

276
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,580
I'm talking about who they serve.

277
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,700
Demons.

278
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,690
They get their power from demons.

279
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,360
Yeah.

280
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,870
And there's one here now.

281
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,740
Oh,what, you mean besides you?

282
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,240
Sam,it knows you're in town,
and it's gonna come after you,

283
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,600
And it's way more than you can handle.

284
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,760
Oh,come on. What is this,huh?

285
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,820
Please tell me you're not
listening to this crap.

286
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,170
Put a leash on your brother,
Sam,if you want to keep him.

287
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,855
Dean,just chill out. No! No!

288
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,700
She's messing with your
head! God knows why.

289
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,440
That's who they are!

290
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,690
I'm telling you the truth.

291
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,030
I'm telling you to shut up,bitch!

292
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,660
I'm sorry. Why are you even
a part of this conversation?

293
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,380
Maybe because he's my
brother, you black-Eyed skank!

294
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,405
Oh,right,right. And you care
about your brother so much.

295
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,440
That's why you're checking out,
leaving him all alone. Shut up.

296
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:29,340
Let me try and save him

297
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,850
Since you won't be
here to do it anymore.

298
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,510
I said shut up! Dean,no!

299
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,850
What the hell were you thinking?

300
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,930
What? What the hell was I thinking?

301
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,910
She's a demon,Sam,period. All right?

302
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,610
They want us dead. We want them dead.

303
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,690
Oh,that's funny.

304
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,250
I remember that demon chick in ohio -

305
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,690
Casey
- You didn't want her dead.

306
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,010
Well,she wasn't stringing me
along like a fish on a hook.

307
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,470
No one's stringing me along!

308
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,590
Look,I know it's dangerous
- That she is dangerous -

309
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,270
But like it or not, she's useful.

310
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,620
No! We kill her before she kills us.

311
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,880
Kill her with what? The
gun she fixed for us?

312
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,160
Whatever works.

313
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,570
Dean,if she wants us dead,

314
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,780
All she has to do is
stop saving our lives.

315
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,240
Look,we have to start looking
at the big picture,Dean.

316
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,330
Start thinking in strategies and
- And moves ahead.

317
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,680
It's not so simple. We're
not just hunting anymore.

318
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,820
We're at war.

319
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,480
Are you feeling okay?

320
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,280
Why are you always asking me that?

321
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,740
Because you're taking advice
from a demon,for starters.

322
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:46,830
And,by the way,

323
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,210
You seem less and less
worried about offing people.

324
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,620
It used to eat you up inside.

325
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,080
And what has that gotten me?

326
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,690
Nothing,but it's just want
you're supposed to do,okay?

327
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,490
We're supposed to drive
in the freaking car

328
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,060
And freaking argue about this stuff!

329
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,590
You go on about the sanctity
of life and all that crap.

330
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,380
Wait,so you're mad because
I'm starting to agree with you?

331
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,800
No,I'm not mad!

332
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,290
I'm
- I'm...

333
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,810
I'm worried.

334
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,150
Sam,I'm worried because you're
not acting like yourself.

335
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,140
Yeah,you're right. I'm not.

336
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,740
I don't have a choice.

337
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,120
What is that supposed to mean?

338
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,660
Look,Dean, you're leaving,right?

339
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,690
And I got to stay here in
this crap hole of a world...

340
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,180
Alone.

341
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,110
So,the way I see it,
if I'm gonna make it,

342
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,260
If I'm gonna fight this
war after you're gone,

343
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,330
Then I got to change.

344
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,370
Change into what?

345
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,950
Into you.

346
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,010
I got to be more like you.

347
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,250
What's going on with you?

348
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,020
I don't know.

349
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,775
Sam,something's wrong.

350
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,590
A bunch of knives inside of me.

351
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,240
Dean? Son of a bitch.

352
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,320
Dean. Ohh!

353
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,580
The coven,man. It's got to be the coven.

354
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,690
Dean,I can't find it!

355
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,360
No.

356
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,090
Sam,what are you doing?

357
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,900
Sam!

358
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,430
Let him go.

359
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,100
Let who go? What are you doing?

360
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,890
You're insane. Get out!

361
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,350
Look,if you know about me,
then you know about this gun.

362
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,830
You're killing my
brother. Now let him go.

363
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,490
Get away from the altar. What?

364
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,400
Now!

365
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,910
You want to kill me? Get in line,bitch.

366
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,870
Stop... calling me bitch.

367
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,200
Go.

368
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,120
What? W-W-We weren't
hurting anyone.

369
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,340
Please,we don't even know your brother.

370
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,870
Stop the spell or die.

371
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,780
Five seconds. What?!

372
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,910
Four.

373
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,990
No,please. Please don't kill us.

374
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,190
We were just getting Renee
a lower mortgage rate.

375
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,885
Next time you point that gun at me,

376
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,780
I'm not gonna just
disappear, understand?

377
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,910
You... saved my life.

378
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,290
Don't mention it.

379
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,890
What was that stuff?

380
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,440
God,it was ass.

381
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,510
It tasted like ass.

382
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,310
It's called witchcraft, short bus.

383
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,450
You're the short bus.

384
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,090
"Short bus. "

385
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,530
Okay,maybe it's not you...

386
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,110
...or you.

387
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,150
Maybe it's you.

388
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,160
I
- I don't even know what he's talking about.

389
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,580
What are you even talking about?

390
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,630
I mean,all of you
- Everyone in your little coven.

391
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,260
You've all had runs of good fortune -

392
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,120
Newsworthy good fortune.

393
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,750
Except for you,Tammi.

394
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,510
Now,tell me,why is that?

395
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,960
You didn't want anything for yourself,

396
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,490
Or is it because you're
already getting what you wanted,

397
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,990
Like these women's souls?

398
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,940
I can't - I'm not
- I-I-I don't...

399
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,340
Nice dick work,magnum.

400
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,180
Let... my brother... go.

401
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,970
What's wrong? Couldn't find my hex bag?

402
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,580
Sorry,sweetheart,

403
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,420
But your brother's lungs
should be on the floor by now.

404
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,870
You're in a lot of trouble, Sam.

405
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,820
Tammi,what's wrong with your eyes?

406
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,090
Tammi,what are you doing?

407
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,550
Renee, shut your painted hole.

408
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,150
What?

409
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,350
I- I will -
You can't -

410
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,150
Not in my house, Tammi Benton.

411
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,280
Look! You got me!

412
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,510
Let the girl go.

413
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,790
Wait your turn,young man.

414
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,260
Ohh,god!

415
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,900
Lizzy,it's okay.

416
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,250
You're not Tammi?

417
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,290
No. But I'm wearing her meat.

418
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,250
I had to break the ice
with you girls somehow.

419
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,620
You killed Renee.

420
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,680
Renee,Amanda.

421
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,890
That's what happens to witches
who get voted off the island.

422
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,540
Who are you?

423
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,640
Funny story,actually.

424
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,500
You remember all those
dark, demonic forces

425
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,010
You prayed to when you
swore your servitude?

426
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,680
Just who did you think
you were praying to?

427
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,790
This - This isn't
- It can't be.

428
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,600
What did you think it was?

429
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,760
Make-Believe, positive thinking,

430
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,220
The secret?

431
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,800
No. It was me.

432
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,610
You sold yourself to me, you pig.

433
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,010
All I had to do was bring
one good book to book club,

434
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,750
And you ladies lined up to kiss my ass.

435
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,660
No. No. We didn't know -

436
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,100
Oh,yes,you did.

437
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,290
You knew every step of the way,

438
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,090
And now your ever-Living
souls are mine.

439
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,780
Comments,questions?

440
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,830
Sammy Winchester,wow.

441
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,360
Right here in our little town.

442
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,110
You know,my friends and I
- We've been looking for you.

443
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,490
Why?

444
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,270
Oh,right, because I'm supposed

445
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,930
To lead some piss-Poor demon army.

446
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,710
No,not at all. You're not our messiah.

447
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,550
We don't believe in you.

448
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,770
But there's a new leader
rising in the west.

449
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,600
A real leader.

450
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,060
That's the horse to bet on,Sam,

451
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,990
The one who's gonna
tear this world apart.

452
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,100
Thing is,this demon
- It doesn't like you very much.

453
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,830
It doesn't want the competition.

454
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,190
Nothing personal. It's a p. R. Thing.

455
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,620
So,bye-Bye.

456
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,660
Two for one. Lovely.

457
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,640
Wait.

458
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,220
Please.

459
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,780
I just... came to talk.

460
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,880
You made it out of the gate.

461
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,690
Impressive.

462
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,390
It was a bitch of a fight, wasn't it?

463
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,620
Doors out of hell only open for so long.

464
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,060
What do you want,Ruby?

465
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,080
I've been lost without you.

466
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,370
Take me back.

467
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,160
That's why I led the Winchesters here.

468
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,620
They're for you... as a gift.

469
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,410
Really?

470
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,490
Let me serve you again.

471
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,030
I've wanted it.

472
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,230
I've wanted you for so long.

473
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,420
You were one of my best.

474
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,030
But then again, you
always were a lying whore.

475
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,680
Tammi: you're really telling
me you threw in your chips

476
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,220
With abbott and costello here?

477
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,600
Come on. Get up.

478
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,760
I said get up!

479
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,450
We've been here before, haven't we?

480
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,890
She didn't tell you?

481
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,090
Pretty mortifying,I guess.

482
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,440
She was one of mine.

483
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,190
I turned her out a long,long time ago.

484
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,000
Ruby here was a witch.

485
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,440
Of course,that was when you were human.

486
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,090
Oh,didn't want your friends to know

487
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,240
That all those centuries
back, you sold yourself to me?

488
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,300
Embarrassing,I guess.

489
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,690
But don't worry,love.

490
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,940
No secrets where
you're heading,remember?

491
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:43,880
Go.

492
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,530
I'll clean up this mess.

493
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,610
Come on.

494
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,280
Go.

495
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,540
So,the devil may care after all.

496
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,560
Is that what I'm supposed to believe?

497
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,820
I don't believe in the devil.

498
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:10,930
Wacky night.

499
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,130
So,let me get this straight.

500
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,120
You were human once.

501
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,860
You died,went to hell, and became a...

502
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,930
Yeah.

503
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,850
How long ago?

504
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,920
Back when the plague was big.

505
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,110
So,all of them -
Every damn demon -

506
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,770
They were all human once?

507
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,340
Everyone I've ever met.

508
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,220
Well,they sure don't act like it.

509
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,480
Most of them have
forgotten what it means...

510
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,360
Or even that they were.

511
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,770
That's what happens
when you go to hell,Dean.

512
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,360
That's what hell is -

513
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,970
Forgetting what you are.

514
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,410
Philosophy lesson from a demon.

515
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,230
I'll pass,thanks.

516
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,090
It's not philosophy.
It's not a metaphor.

517
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,760
There's a real fire in the pit,

518
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,460
Agonies you can't even imagine.

519
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,690
No,I saw "hellraiser. " I get the gist.

520
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,130
Actually,they got that pretty close...

521
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,590
Except for all the custom leather.

522
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,400
The answer is yes, by the way.

523
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,380
Sorry?

524
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,870
Yes,the same thing will happen to you.

525
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,350
It might take centuries,

526
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:39,300
But sooner or later,hell
will burn away your humanity.

527
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,410
Every hell-Bound soul,

528
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,700
Everyone, turns into something else.

529
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,350
Turns you into us, so,yeah -

530
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,630
Yeah,you can count on it.

531
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,680
There's no way of saving
me from the pit,is there?

532
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,220
No.

533
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,640
Why'd you tell Sam that you could?

534
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,650
So he would talk to me.

535
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,250
You Winchesters can be pretty bigoted,

536
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,780
And I needed something
to help him get past the -

537
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,790
The demon thing?

538
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,740
That's pretty hard to get past.

539
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,250
Look at you...

540
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,160
Trying to be all stoic.

541
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,810
My god,it's heartbreaking.

542
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,250
Why are you telling me all this?

543
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,050
I need your help.

544
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,000
Help with what? With Sam.

545
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,690
The way you stuck that demon tonight -

546
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,050
It was pretty tough.

547
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,340
Sam's almost there, but not quite.

548
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,790
You need to help me get him ready...

549
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,560
For life without you.

550
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,630
To fight this war on his own.

551
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,890
Ruby.

552
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,470
Why do you want us to win?

553
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,770
Isn't it obvious?

554
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,840
I'm not like them.

555
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,400
I don't know why.

556
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,740
I wish I was,but I'm not.

557
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,290
I remember what it's like.

558
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,060
What what's like?

559
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,290
Being human.

560
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:50,360
