1
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:04,925
I got a year to live, Sam.
I'd like to make the most of this.

2
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:08,544
What do you say we kill evil
sons of bitches and we raise a little hell?

3
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:12,594
You didn't tell Dean?
- What?

4
00:00:12,768 --> 00:00:14,559
There's a new up-and-comer: Lilith.

5
00:00:14,728 --> 00:00:18,062
She really, really wants
Sam's intestines on a stick.

6
00:00:18,232 --> 00:00:19,892
Let Dean out of his deal right now.

7
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:22,439
I'm just a saleswoman.
I got a boss like everybody.

8
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:24,936
- Who holds the contract?
- I can't tell you.

9
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:29,741
Bela Talbot's her real name.
The Colt.

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,118
- Bela stole the Colt.
- I want it back, Bela.

11
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:34,281
Your little pistol, you mean? Sorry.

12
00:00:34,457 --> 00:00:36,616
You understand
how many people are gonna die?

13
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:39,082
What exactly is it
that you think I plan to do?

14
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:42,623
Take the only weapon we have
and sell it to the highest bidder.

15
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,290
- You know nothing about me.
Pack your crap.

16
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:48,042
- Why? Where we going?
- We go hunt the bitch down.

17
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:50,262
- I don't wanna go to hell.
- We'll save you.

18
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:52,639
I'm scared, Sam. I'm really scared.

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,597
And the only person that can
get me out of this thing is me.

20
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:57,396
And me.

21
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:07,692
Up for a drink?
No, I can't.

22
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:11,071
I gotta be up at the crack of dawn.
Duty calls.

23
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:13,155
A boob job?
I wish.

24
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:15,490
No, some crabby old broad
wants the works.

25
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,494
I need a forklift to get it all back up.

26
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:20,291
All that work to hack,
what, 15 minutes off their faces?

27
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:23,169
Staying young is a brutal business.

28
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:00,786
Hey, hey.

29
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:04,373
Help! Help!

30
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:09,465
Help! Help! Let me out of here.

31
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:11,219
Help!

32
00:02:22,904 --> 00:02:24,019
Sir?

33
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:25,361
Please.

34
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:28,993
It's okay, sir.
Let me see what happened.

35
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:32,244
Don't you worry.
There's nothing I haven't seen.

36
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:35,740
- No, no, no.
- Let me see.

37
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:53,978
Stop.

38
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:56,020
You ready to talk?

39
00:02:57,816 --> 00:03:00,438
I don't know. I don't know anything.

40
00:03:01,028 --> 00:03:03,021
Oh, you hear that, Sam?
He doesn't know anything.

41
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:04,277
Yeah, I heard.

42
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,406
- I'm telling you the truth.
Oh, you are?

43
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:09,073
My God, then I owe you an apology.

44
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:10,574
Allow me to make it up to you.

45
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:23,419
I'm gonna ask you one last time.
Who holds my contract?

46
00:03:35,398 --> 00:03:36,726
Your mother.

47
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,315
Yeah, she, uh, showed it to me
right before I bent her over.

48
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:48,407
I want a name.

49
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:49,907
- Or else...
- Or what?

50
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:51,320
Hmm?

51
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,499
You gonna squirt your holy water
in both ends?

52
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,752
Please. Brother, that's like a flea bite...

53
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:00,674
...compared to what's coming to me
if I tell you jack.

54
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:04,798
Do what you want.

55
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:08,838
The only thing I'm scared of
is the demon holding your ticket.

56
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:24,859
How's that feel? Does that feel good?

57
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:29,202
Go ahead.

58
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:31,491
Send me back to hell.

59
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,792
Because when you get there,
I'll be waiting for you.

60
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:37,420
With a few pals who are dying...

61
00:04:37,588 --> 00:04:40,839
...for a nice little meet and greet
with Dean Winchester.

62
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:44,546
Should I?

63
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,760
Send him someplace
he can't hurt anyone else.

64
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:04,072
You ran the prints twice? You're sure?

65
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:09,326
Okay. Yeah, just chalk it up to lab error.

66
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:13,957
Ha, ha, don't I know it. Okay, thanks.
Yeah, I'll tell the lieutenant.

67
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:15,585
Bury the body?

68
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:17,379
Yeah. Poor schmuck.

69
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:20,751
It's like these demons ride him hard
just for kicks.

70
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:25,052
Uh. What's the phone call about?

71
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,637
Remember that thing
in the paper yesterday?

72
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:30,429
- Stripper suffocates dude with thighs?
- The other thing.

73
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:34,682
Right, the guy that walks into the ER and
kneels over dead, his stomach ripped out?

74
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:37,693
His liver, actually.
Anyways, I found something interesting.

75
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,403
- What?
- The dead body?

76
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:42,774
Covered in bloody fingerprints.
Not the victim's.

77
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:45,613
Great, my man Dave Caruso'll
be stoked to hear it.

78
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:50,412
Those fingerprints match
a guy who died in 1981.

79
00:05:50,582 --> 00:05:52,455
Really?

80
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,915
So, what are we talking?
Uh, walking dead?

81
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:57,329
- Walking, killing dead?
- Maybe.

82
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:01,090
Zombies do like
the other "other white meat. "

83
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,709
Huh. Mm.

84
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:06,509
- What do you care about zombies?
- What do you mean?

85
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:09,007
You've been on soul-saving detail
for months...

86
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:12,138
...now three weeks out and
you're interested in some zombie action?

87
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:14,187
You're the one
who's been gung ho to hunt.

88
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:16,813
- I just thought I'd be doing you a favor.
- No, no, no.

89
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:21,314
I didn't say I didn't wanna do it, okay?
Obviously, I wanna hunt some zombies.

90
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:22,770
Okay, fine. Whatever.

91
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:34,498
Yup, the rest of the body was intact.
The liver was the only organ missing.

92
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,546
Where the liver was ripped out, did you
happen to notice any teeth marks?

93
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:41,295
Can I see your badges?

94
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:42,500
Of course, sure.

95
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:49,184
Fine, so you're cops and morons.

96
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:54,180
- Excuse me? No, no, we're very smart.
The liver was not ripped out.

97
00:07:00,197 --> 00:07:03,862
It was removed. Surgically.

98
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:07,485
By someone who knew their way
around a scalpel.

99
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:10,202
Didn't you read my report?

100
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:15,704
Of course we did. It was, uh, riveting.
It's a real page-turner. Just delightful.

101
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:18,626
- You done?
- I think so.

102
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,377
- Please, go away.
- Okay.

103
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:22,094
Sure.

104
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:29,635
- What?
- Nothing.

105
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:33,062
So that punches a hole in our
zombie theory, huh, that scalpel thing?

106
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:35,723
Zombie with skills?
Dr. Quinn, medicine zombie.

107
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:40,065
Maybe we're on the wrong track, Dean,
looking for hacked-up corpses.

108
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:42,695
- What should we be looking for?
- Survivors.

109
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:45,239
This isn't zombie lunch.
This is organ theft.

110
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:50,576
I told the cops all of this yesterday.
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

111
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,209
Just a couple questions, sir.

112
00:07:52,377 --> 00:07:58,083
Hey, man, I just got my kidney stolen.
I'm tired.

113
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:01,171
We'll be out of here quick.
Don't you wanna get the guy?

114
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:02,922
Will it get me back my kidney?

115
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:07,843
- Sir, what's the last thing you remember?
- Feeding my meter.

116
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:14,983
I'm jumped from behind
and then I wake up strapped to a table.

117
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:19,612
And then the worst pain
you could possibly imagine, only worse.

118
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,278
And then I black out again, thank God.

119
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:27,913
And then I wake up screaming
in some no-tell motel...

120
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:30,786
...in a bathtub full of ice.

121
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,917
Do you remember anything
about the surgery?

122
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:36,171
What the guy looked like,
any details about the room?

123
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,964
Now, let me think about that.

124
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,960
Yeah.

125
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:43,338
One thing is coming back to me.
You know what I remember?

126
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:45,757
Getting my kidney cut out of my body.

127
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,642
So I got a theory.
- Yeah?

128
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:56,312
I talked to Mr. Giggles' doctor.

129
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:59,155
Turns out,
his incisions were sewn up with silk.

130
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:01,445
- That's weird.
- Yeah, nowadays it is.

131
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:05,069
But silk used to be the suture of choice
back in early 19th century.

132
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:07,915
It was problematic.
Patients would get massive infections.

133
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,624
The death rate was insane.

134
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:11,282
- Good times.
- Right.

135
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,580
So doctors had to do whatever they could
to keep infections from spreading.

136
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,831
- One way was maggots.
- Dude, I'm eating.

137
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:20,341
It actually worked because maggots
eat bad tissue and leave good tissue.

138
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:24,177
Get this, when they found our guy, his
body cavity was stuffed full of maggots.

139
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:28,133
Dude, I'm eating.
All right, let me get this straight.

140
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,223
- So people are getting ganked.
- Yeah.

141
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:32,853
<i>A little Antiques Roadshow surgery,
some, uh, organ theft.</i>

142
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:35,480
- Why is this all sounding familiar?
- You heard it before.

143
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:36,850
When you were a kid.

144
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,191
From Dad.

145
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:42,023
Doc Benton.

146
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:44,692
Real-life doctor,
lived in New Hampshire, brilliant.

147
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:49,165
And obsessed with alchemy,
especially how to live forever.

148
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:51,790
So in 1816,
Doc abandons his practice...

149
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:54,203
Right, yeah, nobody hears from him
for 20 years.

150
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,874
And people start showing up dead.

151
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:59,500
Dead or missing an organ, or a hand,
or some other kind of part.

152
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:02,216
Whatever he was doing was working.
He kept on ticking.

153
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,382
Parts would wear out,
he'd replace them.

154
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:06,350
Dad hunted him and took his heart out.

155
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:09,188
Yeah, I guess the doc
must've plugged in a new one.

156
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,808
All right, where's he doing the deed?

157
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:15,106
Benton's picky
about where he sets up his lab.

158
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:16,819
He likes dense forest...

159
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:19,905
...with access to a river or stream
or some kind of fresh water.

160
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:21,699
- Why?
- Because that's where...

161
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:25,913
...he likes to dump the bile,
and intestines, and fecal matter.

162
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,742
Lost your appetite yet?

163
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,705
Oh, baby, I can't stay mad at you.

164
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,501
Shh.

165
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:09,017
No, please.

166
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:13,273
No, no.

167
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:23,662
No.

168
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,538
No.

169
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:54,043
So these are all old hunting cabins.
They've been abandoned for years.

170
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:55,622
Then what the hell we waiting for?

171
00:13:04,514 --> 00:13:07,680
- Bobby?
- Hey. I think I finally got a beat on Bela.

172
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,424
<i>I'm listening.
- Rufus Turner.</i>

173
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:12,478
Is that like a Cleveland Steamer?

174
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:15,055
<i>He's a hunter, or used to be.
- And now?</i>

175
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:17,940
Hermit, mostly.
Does a little selling on the side.

176
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:21,397
Anyway,
I put the word out on Bela months ago.

177
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:25,903
<i>He just called, said a woman
got in touch, wanted to buy some things.</i>

178
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:28,035
<i>- And he thinks it's Bela?
British accent.</i>

179
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:31,657
<i>- Went by the name Mina Chandler.
- She's used that before.</i>

180
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:35,001
It's a sloppy move, getting in contact
with one of your old friends?

181
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:38,172
Friend?
Haven't laid eyes on him in 15 years.

182
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:42,968
And he's not the Christmas-card type.
I doubt she knows I know him.

183
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:44,383
Canaan, Vermont.

184
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:47,391
- Thanks, Bobby, we're on our way.
- One other thing.

185
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,432
Take a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.

186
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:51,515
Okay.

187
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:53,269
We're going after Bela.

188
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,145
- What? Whoa. Hold on a...
- Get your stuff, the clock's ticking.

189
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:59,023
Look, I think we should stay here
and finish the case.

190
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:01,272
- You insane?
- There's no way she has the Colt.

191
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:04,366
That was months ago. She probably
sold it the second she got it.

192
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:06,528
- Well, then I'll kill her. Win-win.
- Dean...

193
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:08,032
Sam, we're going.

194
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,577
- No.
- Why the hell not?

195
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:14,451
Dean, this here, now.
This is what's gonna save you.

196
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:19,042
- What? Chasing some Frankenstein?
- Chasing immortality.

197
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:22,214
Look, Benton can't die.

198
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:24,546
We find out how he did it,
we can do it to you.

199
00:14:24,723 --> 00:14:27,392
- What?
- You have to die before you go to hell.

200
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,894
- So if you can never die...
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second.

201
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:36,192
Did you know that this was Doc Benton
from the jump?

202
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:38,070
No.

203
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:42,359
- I was hoping...
- So the zombie thing, it was lying to me?

204
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:45,867
I didn't wanna say anything until
I was sure. I'm trying to find an answer.

205
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:49,621
No, what you're trying to do
is chase Slicey McHackey here.

206
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,998
To kill him?
No, you wanna buy him a freaking beer.

207
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:54,162
- You wanna study him.
- I was trying to help.

208
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:58,383
You're not helping. You forget
that if I welch on this deal, you die.

209
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,836
- Living forever is welching.
- Whatever the magic pill is, I'll take it.

210
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:05,381
<i>Oh, what is this, Sid and Nancy?
No, it's just like Bobby's been saying.</i>

211
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,310
We kill the demon that
holds the contract, this wipes clean.

212
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:09,557
- That's our best shot.

213
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:11,556
Even if you had the Colt,
who you gonna shoot?

214
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:15,432
- We have no idea who holds the ticket.
- I'll shoot the Hellhounds then.

215
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,603
- Now, you coming or not?
- I'm staying here.

216
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:21,192
No, you're not.

217
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:25,828
I'm not letting you wander in the woods
alone to track some organ-stealing freak.

218
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:27,455
- You're not gonna let me?
- No.

219
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:29,165
How are you gonna stop me?

220
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:34,870
Look, man,
we're trying to do the same thing here.

221
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:40,632
I know.

222
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,095
But I'm going.

223
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:51,178
So if you wanna stay, stay.

224
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,325
Sammy, be careful.

225
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,583
You too.

226
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,450
<i>What?</i>

227
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,499
Hi, uh, Rufus.

228
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:53,670
Yeah, even if I am,
the question is still the same. What?

229
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,420
Uh, I'm Dean Winchester,
I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's.

230
00:16:57,592 --> 00:16:59,087
<i>So?</i>

231
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:02,049
<i>- You called him this morning.
So?</i>

232
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,683
<i>Uh, ahem, you told Bobby about
a British chick, made contact with you.</i>

233
00:17:07,854 --> 00:17:10,558
Yeah, and so?
- Do you know where she is?

234
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:13,269
<i>Yeah.
- Could you tell me where I could find her?</i>

235
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:15,684
<i>No.
- Of course not.</i>

236
00:17:15,862 --> 00:17:17,237
Ahem, look, Rufus, man, heh...

237
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:21,615
Look, let me point something out to you.

238
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:24,074
You are knocking at my door,
so don't "look, man" me.

239
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:26,286
I'm not your man.

240
00:17:26,707 --> 00:17:28,331
I'm sorry, sir.

241
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,335
I'm gonna tell you a little story.
Once, Bobby called me.

242
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:33,911
Asked me to call him
if I got a whiff of Bela Talbot.

243
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:37,375
I got a whiff, I called. The end.

244
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:41,217
If you could just tell me where she is,
I mean, that'd be great, heh.

245
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:43,761
- Dean Winchester, right?
- Yeah.

246
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:46,056
Dean, do I look like I'm here to help you?

247
00:17:47,103 --> 00:17:50,140
- I'm gonna say no, heh.
- Then get the hell off my property.

248
00:17:50,315 --> 00:17:54,443
All right, hey, fair enough.
I got one more question for you, though.

249
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:58,562
See, I got this, ahem,
bottle of Scotch and, uh...

250
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,443
Is this considered good?

251
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:08,948
Well, bottoms up.

252
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:16,583
You know, I don't even bother drinking
unless it's this stuff.

253
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:21,129
- Nectar of the gods, I'm telling you.
- Yeah, it's a nice change, you know.

254
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:23,465
Most of my whiskey
comes from a plastic jug.

255
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:32,348
- So Bela was here because...?
- She wanted to buy a couple of things.

256
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:34,852
Which is gonna take me
some time to round up.

257
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:36,986
Where is she now?

258
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:40,532
Kid, can I ask you something?

259
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:44,489
- Sure.
- You got three weeks left.

260
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:46,324
Why are you wasting your time...

261
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:49,702
...chasing after that skinny,
stuck-up English girl?

262
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:55,297
How do you know about that?

263
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,635
Because I know things.

264
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,930
I know a lot of things
about a lot of people.

265
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,511
That so?

266
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,809
I know ain't no pea shooter
gonna save you.

267
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,562
What makes you so sure?

268
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,025
Because that's the job, kid.

269
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,951
Even if you manage
to scrape out of this one...

270
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,704
...there's just gonna be something else
down the road.

271
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,914
Folks like us...

272
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,911
...there ain't no happy ending.

273
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:35,164
We all got it coming.

274
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:41,556
Well, ain't you a bucket of sunshine.

275
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:49,104
I'm what you've got to look forward to
if you survive.

276
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:54,859
Which you won't.

277
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:40,944
So, Bela.

278
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:46,157
Hotel Canaan. Room 39.

279
00:20:47,794 --> 00:20:49,205
But watch your back.

280
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:51,415
I think I can handle Bela.

281
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,463
Oh, don't be so sure about that.

282
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:56,582
There are things
that you don't know about her.

283
00:20:57,554 --> 00:20:59,013
Oh, and you do?

284
00:20:59,181 --> 00:21:02,098
Right, because you know things.

285
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:05,513
- Yep.
- Let me guess, you lift her fingerprint?

286
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:07,313
Yep.

287
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:10,151
- And that got you jack.
- Yep.

288
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:14,318
She burned them off.

289
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:17,362
Probably years ago.

290
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:20,203
- Yeah, so you're right where we are.
- Nope.

291
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,829
- You do her ear?
- Sorry?

292
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,999
You do her ear?

293
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:31,999
Did I do her...?

294
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:37,583
Hey, man, I'll try anything once, but
I don't know, that sounds uncomfortable.

295
00:21:39,056 --> 00:21:41,973
Ears are as unique to humans
as fingerprints.

296
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,341
No kidding.

297
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,313
Course, that don't fly in the courts
over here, but in England?

298
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:51,642
They're all over it.

299
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:57,861
A friend of a friend of a friend...

300
00:21:58,034 --> 00:22:03,076
...faxed me 10 pages
of confidential files within a day.

301
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:07,033
All I had to send him
was one clean shot off the security cam.

302
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:10,296
Right.

303
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:13,373
One clean shot of her ear.

304
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:31,310
The so-called Bela Talbot.

305
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:58,005
Shh, shh, shh.

306
00:24:58,183 --> 00:25:01,931
It's okay, I'm here to help you.
I'm here to help you, I'm gonna help you.

307
00:25:02,103 --> 00:25:03,432
Uh. Okay. Shh.

308
00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:06,892
Okay. Shh, shh, shh.

309
00:25:08,568 --> 00:25:09,766
Oh, God.

310
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:13,563
Sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Shh.

311
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:18,776
Shh, shh, shh.

312
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:19,266
Okay, watch your head.
Watch your head.

313
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:22,311
Sorry.

314
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:33,150
It's gonna be fine, I promise you.

315
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:21,581
- Where's the Colt?
- Dean.

316
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,707
No extra words.

317
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:25,336
It's long gone.

318
00:27:25,503 --> 00:27:27,627
Across the world by now.

319
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:31,503
- You're lying.
- I'll call the buyer. Speak Farsi?

320
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:34,547
What the hell are you...?

321
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:35,837
Don't flatter yourself.

322
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:41,010
- Don't move.
- I told you, I don't have it.

323
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:44,058
Oh, yeah, I'm definitely
gonna take your word for it.

324
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:55,235
Don't move.

325
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,588
It's gone.

326
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:10,791
Get on a plane if you must.

327
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:16,507
Track down the buyer.
You might catch up to him, eventually.

328
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:24,430
- Are you going to kill me?
- Oh, yeah.

329
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:29,645
- You're not the cold-blooded type.
- You mean, like you?

330
00:28:29,822 --> 00:28:31,102
It's true.

331
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:33,654
See, I couldn't imagine
killing my parents.

332
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,827
- I don't know what you're...
- Yes, you do.

333
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:41,157
You were, what, 14?

334
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:46,164
Your folks die in some shady accident,
police suspected a slashed brake line...

335
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:48,628
...but it was all too crispy to tell.

336
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,963
Cut to little Bela...

337
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:52,174
I'm sorry. Abbie.

338
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:55,136
- Inheriting millions.

339
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:57,595
- How did you even...?
- Doesn't matter.

340
00:29:22,753 --> 00:29:24,746
They were lovely people.

341
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,328
And I killed them.

342
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,960
And I got rich.

343
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,009
I can't be bothered to give a damn.

344
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:35,965
Just like I don't care
what happens to you.

345
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:47,018
You make me sick.

346
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:50,024
Likewise.

347
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:17,392
You're not worth it.

348
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,794
It worked.

349
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:50,676
He found me.

350
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:54,051
No, Sam wasn't with him.

351
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:56,094
But I know where they are.

352
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:03,686
- Dean?
- Yeah.

353
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:06,101
<i>You get the Colt?
- What do you think?</i>

354
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:08,187
<i>- So does that mean Bela is, uh...?
No, no.</i>

355
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:10,937
She deserves to die a dozen times over,
but I couldn't do it.

356
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:12,990
<i>Dean...
- I'm really screwed, Sammy.</i>

357
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,281
<i>- No, you're just...
- You were right, Bela was a goose chase.</i>

358
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:21,624
The Colt's gone.
And this time I'm really screwed, Sam.

359
00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:23,704
Maybe not.

360
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,459
<i>Dean, I found Benton's cabin.</i>

361
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:27,506
<i>- You okay? Was he there?
Yeah.</i>

362
00:31:27,676 --> 00:31:28,755
<i>- Did you kill him?
No.</i>

363
00:31:28,927 --> 00:31:30,966
<i>- What do you mean, no?
Listen for a second.</i>

364
00:31:31,137 --> 00:31:33,711
I found his lab book
and it has the formula.

365
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,848
<i>What, the live-forever formula?
- Yeah.</i>

366
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:38,640
Let me guess,
I gotta drink blood out of a baby's skull?

367
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:45,527
No, that's the thing, it's not black magic.
There's no blood sacrifice or anything.

368
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,189
It's just science, Dean.

369
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,483
<i>Very, very,
extremely weird science, but...</i>

370
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,945
<i>- Wait, what are you saying? You think...?
I think it might be doable.</i>

371
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:58,165
I know we've hit a lot of walls, but
I think this formula, I think it might be it.

372
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,666
<i>This could save you.</i>

373
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,330
Okay, so this formula...

374
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:06,122
Look, we're not in the clear yet,
there are still things that I don't get...

375
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,169
Sam?

376
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,053
<i>Sammy?</i>

377
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:29,021
You can relax.

378
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,776
It's all gonna be okay.

379
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,783
Ain't nothing gonna happen here
that you got to worry about, Sammy.

380
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:39,000
And your chances of coming out
of this procedure alive...

381
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,911
...very, very high.

382
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:42,826
How do you know my name?

383
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:45,916
Oh.

384
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:48,666
I know.

385
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:53,598
You think I'm some kind of monster,
don't you?

386
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:59,971
Well, I gotta tell you, I have never done
one thing that I did not have to do.

387
00:33:00,148 --> 00:33:05,522
This whole eternal life thing
is very high-maintenance.

388
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:13,695
Something goes bad, like my eyes here,
you gotta replace them.

389
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:24,672
And sometimes, things get damaged,
like when your father cut out my heart.

390
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:26,086
Now, that...

391
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:29,842
That was very inconvenient.

392
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:38,347
So I'm sure that you can understand
all the joy I felt...

393
00:33:38,522 --> 00:33:43,896
...when I read all about myself here
in his journal.

394
00:33:49,617 --> 00:33:52,287
Kind of makes this whole thing...

395
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:57,291
...just feel like some kind
of family reunion, don't it?

396
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:05,414
Well, I guess it's about time
that we get this thing started.

397
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,183
Shoot all you want.

398
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:45,958
A knife?

399
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:52,638
What part of immortality
do you not understand?

400
00:34:56,437 --> 00:34:59,557
Pity about the heart, though.

401
00:34:59,732 --> 00:35:02,603
It was a brand-new one.

402
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:04,356
Good.

403
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,653
Should be pumping nice and strong.

404
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:11,941
Sending this stuff
throughout your whole body.

405
00:35:12,871 --> 00:35:16,620
See, I picked up your little bottle upstairs
and dipped the knife in it.

406
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:32,850
Oh, hiya, Doc.

407
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:36,927
Wakey wakey eggs and bakey.

408
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,517
- Please.
Please what?

409
00:35:40,692 --> 00:35:43,694
You've been killing for over 150 years
and now you got a request?

410
00:35:43,863 --> 00:35:46,568
- Shut up.
- You don't understand, I can help you.

411
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:48,698
I know what you need.

412
00:35:48,868 --> 00:35:52,237
I'm gonna have to cut him into bits.
This immortality thing is a bitch.

413
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:55,200
I can read the formula for you.

414
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:59,667
You know, immortality...

415
00:35:59,837 --> 00:36:03,124
...forever young, never die.

416
00:36:10,265 --> 00:36:11,724
Dean.

417
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:15,512
Sam.

418
00:36:21,861 --> 00:36:23,521
What?

419
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:29,152
We're talking hell in three weeks or
needing a new pancreas in half a century.

420
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:31,201
You can't exactly get those
at a Kwik-E-Mart.

421
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:34,122
It's not perfect, but it buys us time
to think of something better.

422
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:38,537
We just need time, Dean.
I mean, please, just think about it.

423
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:43,668
No.

424
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:46,002
- Don't you wanna live?
- He isn't living.

425
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:47,459
- This is simple.
- Simple?

426
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:51,470
To me it is, okay?
Black or white. Human, not human.

427
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:55,554
You see, what the doc is...
He's a freaking monster.

428
00:36:56,021 --> 00:36:57,302
I can't do it.

429
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:00,100
I would rather go to hell.

430
00:37:00,277 --> 00:37:03,527
You don't understand. I can help you.

431
00:37:07,117 --> 00:37:08,576
Now, I'm gonna take care of him.

432
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,032
You can either help me or not.
It's up to you.

433
00:37:42,362 --> 00:37:45,233
No, no. Don't be stupid!

434
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:47,732
I can help you. No.

435
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,492
Enjoy forever in there, Doc.
I can save you.

436
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:54,368
Let me out! Let me out!

437
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,705
Let me out!

438
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:59,957
Let me out. I can save you!

439
00:38:00,131 --> 00:38:03,714
No, don't! Don't!

440
00:38:05,678 --> 00:38:08,348
No, let me out, let me out.

441
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:12,049
Let me out, let me out, let me out.

442
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:15,063
No!

443
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:17,749
<i>Hiya, Bela.</i>

444
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:19,831
<i>Here's a fun fact you may not know.</i>

445
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:23,127
<i>I felt your hand in my pocket
when you swiped that motel receipt.</i>

446
00:39:23,302 --> 00:39:26,920
- You don't understand.
- I'm pretty sure I understand perfectly.

447
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:29,635
I noticed something interesting
in your hotel room.

448
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,517
<i>Something tucked above the door.</i>

449
00:39:31,686 --> 00:39:34,224
<i>An herb. Devil's shoestring?</i>

450
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,814
<i>Well, there's only one use for that.</i>

451
00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:39,767
Holding Hellhounds at bay.

452
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,649
I went back and I took another look
at your folks' obit.

453
00:39:42,822 --> 00:39:46,274
<i>Turns out, they died 10 years ago today.</i>

454
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,076
You didn't kill them.

455
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:49,823
A demon did your dirty work.

456
00:39:49,997 --> 00:39:53,497
<i>You made a deal, didn't you, Bela?</i>

457
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:55,541
<i>And it's come due.</i>

458
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,708
I can take care of them for you.

459
00:40:05,638 --> 00:40:08,094
And it won't even cost you anything...

460
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:12,847
...for 10 whole years.

461
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:21,737
<i>So is that why you stole the Colt, huh?</i>

462
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:23,364
<i>Try to wiggle out of your deal?</i>

463
00:40:23,532 --> 00:40:25,524
<i>- Our gun for your soul?
- Yes.</i>

464
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:28,027
But stealing the Colt
wasn't quite enough, I'm guessing.

465
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,738
They changed the deal.

466
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:32,951
They wanted me to kill Sam.

467
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:36,329
Really? Wow. Demons untrustworthy.

468
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:38,497
Ha. Shocker.

469
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:40,416
That's, uh, kind of a tight deadline too.

470
00:40:40,592 --> 00:40:45,337
<i>Uh, what time is it?
Oh, look at that, almost midnight.</i>

471
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:47,674
Dean, listen, I need help.

472
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,017
- Sweetheart, we are weeks past help.
- I know I don't deserve it.

473
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:53,938
You're right, you don't. But you know
what the bitch of the bunch is?

474
00:40:54,106 --> 00:40:57,142
<i>If you would've just come to us
sooner and asked for help...</i>

475
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:00,069
<i>...we probably could've taken the Colt
and saved you.</i>

476
00:41:00,237 --> 00:41:04,187
I know, and saved yourself.
I know about your deal, Dean.

477
00:41:04,825 --> 00:41:06,071
And who told you that?

478
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:09,696
The demon that holds it.
She holds mine too.

479
00:41:09,873 --> 00:41:11,332
She says she holds every deal.

480
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:13,243
- She?
- Her name's Lilith.

481
00:41:14,336 --> 00:41:15,878
Lilith?

482
00:41:17,214 --> 00:41:18,708
Why should I believe you?

483
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:21,382
You shouldn't, but it's the truth.

484
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:25,384
This can't help you, Bela. Not now.
Why are you telling me this?

485
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:28,888
Because just maybe
you can kill the bitch.

486
00:41:33,356 --> 00:41:34,387
I'll see you in hell.

487
