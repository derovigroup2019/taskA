1
00:00:02,098 --> 00:00:04,589
I got a year to live, Sam.
I'd like to make the most of it.

2
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:08,268
What do you say we kill some evil
sons of bitches and we raise a little hell?

3
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:15,607
I know how you feel, Dean. Dad's dead.

4
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,568
And he left a hole,
and it hurts so bad, you can't take it.

5
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:20,984
I'm okay, okay? The next person
who asks if I'm okay...

6
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:23,533
...I'm gonna start throwing punches.

7
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:26,872
- There's no way to save me from the pit?
- No.

8
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:29,332
You're gonna die.
This is what you're gonna become.

9
00:00:29,504 --> 00:00:31,829
- I don't wanna go to hell.
- We'll find a way to save you.

10
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:33,500
Let Dean out of his deal right now.

11
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:36,379
I'm just a saleswoman.
I got a boss like everybody.

12
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:38,711
- Who holds the contract?
- I can't tell you.

13
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:43,474
- Tell me what?
- There's a big, new up-and-comer.

14
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,304
- Her name is Lilith.
- Lilith?

15
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,646
And she really, really wants
Sam's intestines on a stick.

16
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:49,978
You knew about this?

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,393
Well, jeez, Sam,
is there anything else I should know?

18
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:44,952
<i>- Hello?
Ben.</i>

19
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:47,500
<i>- Linda.
I had to talk to you.</i>

20
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:50,210
<i>- You can't keep calling here.
I know, I know.</i>

21
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:52,755
<i>Just... Just tell me
you thought about it, please.</i>

22
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:54,386
There's nothing to think about.

23
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:56,132
<i>Don't say that.</i>

24
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:57,470
I can't.

25
00:01:57,642 --> 00:01:59,681
You know I can't. My wife.

26
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:02,639
<i>I'm begging you. Come to me.</i>

27
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:04,438
<i>Come to me, Ben.</i>

28
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:05,638
No.

29
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,788
Linda, please.

30
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,333
Please, just leave me alone.

31
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:25,084
<i>I'm not gonna stop. I miss you, Ben.</i>

32
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:28,090
<i>We could be happy.
We could be happy together.</i>

33
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:30,832
This is... This is crazy.

34
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:33,929
<i>I love you. Forever.</i>

35
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:36,137
<i>Don't you love me?</i>

36
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,683
You know I do.

37
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,889
More than anything.

38
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,359
But...

39
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:47,939
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:49,311
<i>Ben, wait...</i>

41
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,206
Okay, Linda.

42
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:46,587
You win.

43
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:53,423
I'm coming.

44
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:09,702
Yep. I got it. Okay, bye.

45
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:12,365
So?

46
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,615
So the professor doesn't know crap.

47
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,250
Shocking. Pack your panties, Sammy.

48
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:17,961
- We're hitting the road.
- What's up?

49
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,913
That was Bobby. Some banker guy
blew his head off in Ohio...

50
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,048
...and he thinks
there's a spirit involved.

51
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:25,629
So you two were talking a case?

52
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:28,045
No, we were, uh,
we were talking about our feelings.

53
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:30,714
And then our favorite boy bands.
Yeah, we were talking a case.

54
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,218
- So a spirit...? What?
- A banker was complaining...

55
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:36,230
...about some electrical problems
at his pad for like a week.

56
00:04:36,398 --> 00:04:39,566
Phones going haywire.
Computers flipping on and off. Eh?

57
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:43,401
- Uh-huh.
- This is not ringing your bell?

58
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:46,740
Well, sure, yeah.
But, Dean, we're on a case.

59
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,988
- Whose?
- Yours.

60
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:51,993
Right, yeah. Well, could have fooled me.

61
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,708
What else
have we been doing lately...

62
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,079
...other than trying to break your deal?
- Chasing our tails, that's what.

63
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,800
Sam, we've talked to every professor,
witch, soothsayer...

64
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,751
...and two-bit carny act in the lower 48.
Nobody knows squat.

65
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,088
And we can't find Bela.
We can't find the Colt.

66
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,469
So until we actually find something,
I'd like to do my job.

67
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,055
- There's one thing we haven't tried.
- No, Sam...

68
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:15,058
- We should summon Ruby.
- I'm not gonna fight...

69
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,391
- She says she knows how to save you.
- Well, she can't.

70
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,731
- Oh, you know for sure?
- I do.

71
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,647
- How?
- Because she told me, okay?

72
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:26,366
- What?
- She told me...

73
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:27,818
...flat out...

74
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:30,701
...that she could not save me.
Nobody can.

75
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:36,086
And you just neglected
to mention this to me?

76
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:38,925
I really don't care what that bitch thinks
and neither should you.

77
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:40,551
Now you're keeping secrets from me?

78
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:43,554
You really wanna talk about
who's keeping secrets from who?

79
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:52,387
- Now where you going?
- Guess I'm going to Ohio.

80
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:10,456
I found him there.

81
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,540
Why don't you just tell us
everything you saw, Mrs. Waters?

82
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:16,416
You mean besides my dead husband?

83
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:20,672
Just everything else you saw, please.

84
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:26,182
There was blood everywhere.

85
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:29,939
The phone was ripped from the wall,
his favorite Scotch on the desk.

86
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,565
What else could you wanna know?

87
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,477
Why was the phone
ripped from the wall?

88
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:35,775
- I don't know.
- You mind if I take a look?

89
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:40,689
I already went over all this
with the other detectives.

90
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,276
We'll be out of your hair
in no time, ma'am.

91
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,119
Ma'am, what time did your husband die?

92
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:52,255
Sometime after 11.

93
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,963
What about strange phone calls?

94
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:03,723
Receive any of those lately? Weird
interference, static, anything like that?

95
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:05,304
No.

96
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:07,688
No.

97
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:11,981
Mrs. Waters, withholding information
from the police is a capital offense.

98
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:18,524
In some parts of the world, I'm sure.

99
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:24,781
A couple of weeks ago,
uh, there was this...

100
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:25,989
This what?

101
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:28,492
I woke up one morning.

102
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,086
I heard Ben in his study.
I thought he was talking to a woman.

103
00:07:32,257 --> 00:07:35,343
- What made you think that?
- Because he kept calling her Linda.

104
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,171
The thing is...

105
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:41,845
...I picked up the other line
and nobody was there.

106
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:43,216
Ben was talking to nobody.

107
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:45,684
There was nothing?
- Just static.

108
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:49,019
You ever speak to Ben about this?

109
00:07:49,193 --> 00:07:52,396
- No. I should've, but no.
- Did he ever say who Linda was?

110
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,657
What difference does it make?
There was no one on the other end.

111
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,702
Linda's a babe. Or was.

112
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:06,786
- Find her?
- Yeah, Linda Bateman.

113
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:09,288
She and, uh, Ben Waters
were high-school sweethearts.

114
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:11,374
- What happened?
- Drunk driver hit them head on.

115
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:12,796
Ben walked away.

116
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:15,341
So, what then? Dead flame calls to chat?

117
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:16,545
You would think.

118
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,682
But Linda was cremated.

119
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:21,057
So why is she still floating around?

120
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,599
- Uh, you got me.
- What about that, uh, caller ID?

121
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:27,400
Turns out it's a phone number.

122
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,027
No phone number I've ever seen.

123
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:32,232
Yeah, because it's about a century old,
from back when phones had cranks.

124
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:34,198
So why use that number to reach out?

125
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,905
Got me there too, but either way,
we should run a trace on it.

126
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:39,321
How are we gonna trace a number
over 100 years old?

127
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:41,787
We don't get too many folks from HQ
down here.

128
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,375
Yes, well, the main office mentioned
that there would be a lunch.

129
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:46,957
I'm sure we can arrange something.

130
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,875
The man you gentlemen
wanna be speaking to is right this...

131
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:53,049
I know. Sorry.

132
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:57,089
Uh, got something of a hygiene issue
down here, if you ask me.

133
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:00,426
Stewie?

134
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:02,728
Ah, uh, uh...
What did I tell you...

135
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,065
...about keeping this place clean?
Spam mail. Spam mail.

136
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:07,315
Stewie Meyers.

137
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:10,357
- Mr. Campbell, Mr. Raimi.
- I don't know how all this got here.

138
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,280
From headquarters.

139
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,698
Oh.

140
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,113
- Give the gentlemen whatever they need.
- Yeah.

141
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,165
Thank you.
Thanks.

142
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:23,791
So can I help you?

143
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:26,913
- Is that, uh, BustyAsianBeauties. Com?
No.

144
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:29,298
<i>Ooh, me so horny.</i>

145
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,094
- Maybe.
Word to the wise.

146
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,472
Platinum membership.
Worth every penny. Huh?

147
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,930
Right, anyway.
Um, we're here to trace a number.

148
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:39,513
- Where did you get this?
- Off caller ID.

149
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:42,606
- Oh, no. That's impossible.
- Hasn't been used in years, we know.

150
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:46,275
A few years? It's prehistoric. Trust me,
nobody's using this number anymore.

151
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:48,569
- Sure. Could you run it anyway?
Sure.

152
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,825
Why don't I just rearrange
my whole life first?

153
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,077
Listen, uh, Stewie.

154
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:58,332
You got, like, six kinds
of employee-code violations down here...

155
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:01,586
...not to mention the sickening porn
clogging up your hard drive.

156
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:07,123
When my partner says run the number,
I suggest you run the number.

157
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:19,892
Okay. Whatever. Jeez.

158
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:24,855
- Holy crap.
- What?

159
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,067
I can't tell you
where the number comes from.

160
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:31,369
But I can tell you where it's been going.

161
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:33,747
What do you mean?

162
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,497
Ten different houses
in the past two weeks...

163
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,628
...all got calls from the same number.

164
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:52,884
So are we done here?

165
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:55,054
Because I was sort of busy.

166
00:10:56,773 --> 00:10:58,232
Right.

167
00:11:26,014 --> 00:11:27,093
Yeah?

168
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:29,507
Hello, sir. I'm with the phone company.

169
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:32,437
- We didn't, uh, call the phone company.
- Oh, no, sir.

170
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:36,305
No, we're calling you. We've had a lot of
complaints from the neighborhood.

171
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:37,515
- Complaints?
- Yes, sir.

172
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:39,686
Um, dropped calls, static.

173
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:42,983
Maybe even strange voices
on the other end of the line.

174
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:44,949
No, we haven't had any of that here.

175
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,075
- Nothing?
- No.

176
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:49,783
Okay, uh, great.
Just thought we'd check.

177
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:51,616
- Thanks.
- No problem.

178
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,544
Okay, let's go. Come on, Simon.

179
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,676
No way you work
for the phone company.

180
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,974
- Sure I do.
- Since when does a phone guy...

181
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,902
...drive a rental or wear a cheap suit?

182
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,732
Yeah?
Well, maybe we're both keeping secrets.

183
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,740
Why'd you ask my dad
if we heard strange voices?

184
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,376
- Why, did you hear something?
- No.

185
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:34,331
- My mistake. Thought maybe you did.
- Well, I didn't, okay?

186
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:37,588
Okay. Sorry to bother you.

187
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:45,845
Because, you know...

188
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:51,263
...if you did,
then I would have told you...

189
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:54,014
...that I've been
right where you're standing right now.

190
00:12:55,778 --> 00:13:00,987
Hearing things, even seeing things
that couldn't be explained.

191
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:05,321
Maybe I would have been able
to help out a little bit.

192
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,864
Anyways...

193
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,754
Hey, wait.

194
00:13:14,716 --> 00:13:16,210
Maybe...

195
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:22,011
Maybe I've been talking on the phone,
with...

196
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:23,971
With my mom.

197
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:27,342
Well, that's not so strange.

198
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:30,725
She's dead. Like, three years now dead.

199
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:32,897
How often does she call you?

200
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,352
A few times.

201
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,653
It started a week ago.

202
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:41,822
I thought I was, like, crazy or something.

203
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:44,954
Well, I can tell you one thing for sure.

204
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,912
And you're gonna have to go with me
on this, okay?

205
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,492
You're not crazy.

206
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:56,757
- Yeah.
- Stiffs are calling people all over town.

207
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:59,218
- Tell me about it.
- I just talked to a grandmother...

208
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,299
...who's having phone sex
with her husband...

209
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,554
<i>- ... who died in Korea.
- Ew.</i>

210
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:05,016
Completely rocked
my understanding of necrophilia.

211
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:08,521
<i>So, what the hell's going on here, Dean?</i>

212
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:12,025
Beats me, but we better find out soon.
This place is turning into spook central.

213
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:15,233
- Yeah. All right, I'll call you later.
- Yeah.

214
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:20,318
Yeah, what?

215
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:23,533
<i>- Sam?
Dean.</i>

216
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:28,042
<i>Dean, is that you?</i>

217
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:29,672
Dad?

218
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:37,811
I mean, Dad?

219
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:40,684
You really think it was Dad?

220
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,769
I don't know. Maybe.

221
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,772
Well, what did he sound like?

222
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:49,737
Like Oprah. It was Dad,
he sounded like Dad, what do you think?

223
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:51,074
What did he say?

224
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,910
My name.

225
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:54,280
That's it?

226
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,451
Yeah, the call dropped out.

227
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:01,207
Why would he even call
in the first place?

228
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:04,467
I don't know, man. Why are ghosts
calling anybody in this town?

229
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:07,551
But other people are hearing
from their loved ones.

230
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:10,095
Why can't we?
It's at least a possibility, right?

231
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,475
Yeah, I guess.

232
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,899
Okay, so what if...?

233
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,613
What if it really is Dad?

234
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,653
What happens if he calls back?

235
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,821
What do you mean?

236
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:30,903
What do I say?

237
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,993
- Hello.
- Hello?

238
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,579
That's what you come back with? Hello?

239
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:39,298
Uh...

240
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:44,925
Hello?

241
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:00,142
Find anything?

242
00:16:00,322 --> 00:16:03,655
After three hours,
I have found no reason...

243
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:06,993
...why anything supernatural
would be going on here.

244
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:08,787
Wow, you'd think
a Stanford education...

245
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:12,325
...and a high-school hookup rate of 0.0
would produce better results than that.

246
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:13,533
Hilarious.

247
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:16,001
Sam, you're just looking
in the wrong places, pal.

248
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:18,379
And what are the right places, Dean?

249
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,667
The motel pamphlet rack.

250
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:24,134
Milan, Ohio.
Birthplace of Thomas Edison.

251
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:25,885
Yeah, right. So what?

252
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,470
Keep reading.

253
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:37,396
You're kidding.

254
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:39,946
And we're walking.

255
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:44,445
And here we have one of the museum's
most unique and treasured possessions:

256
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,373
Thomas Edison's "spirit phone. "

257
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,869
Did you know that Mr. Edison...

258
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,367
...while being one of America's
most beloved inventors...

259
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:54,665
...was also a devout "occultist"?
Ooh!

260
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,583
What's with the quote-y fingers?

261
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:59,381
He spent years
working on this, his final invention...

262
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:03,504
...which he was convinced could be used
to "communicate" with the "dead. "

263
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:05,225
Pretty spooky, huh?

264
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:09,601
And we're walking. We are walking.
We're walking.

265
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:11,434
And we're not touching that.

266
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,850
And we're walking. And stop.

267
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:16,731
Anything?

268
00:17:17,114 --> 00:17:18,774
Nothing.

269
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:20,774
What do you think?

270
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:24,872
Honestly, it kind of looks like
an old pile of junk to me.

271
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,246
- It's not even plugged in.
- Maybe it didn't work like that.

272
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:30,617
Okay.

273
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:34,546
Maybe it's like a radio tower, you know?
Broadcasting the dead all over town.

274
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:37,290
- Could be.
- The caller ID is 100 years old, right?

275
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,803
- Around the time this thing was built.
- But why would it start working now?

276
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:42,634
I don't know.

277
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:46,760
But as long as the moldy are calling
the freshes, it's the best reason we got.

278
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:48,053
Yeah, maybe.

279
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,106
So maybe it really is Dad.

280
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,670
<i>- Dad?
Dean.</i>

281
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,121
Is it really you?

282
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,844
<i>It's me.</i>

283
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,218
<i>- How can I be sure?
You can't.</i>

284
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,882
<i>- Dean, how could you do it?
- Do what?</i>

285
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,847
<i>Sell your soul.</i>

286
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:29,400
<i>- I was looking after Sam, like you said to.
I never wanted this, never.</i>

287
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:31,561
<i>You're my boy. I love you.</i>

288
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:35,023
<i>- I can't watch you go to hell, Dean.
- I'm sorry.</i>

289
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,481
I don't know how to stop it.

290
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,198
<i>Because if you break the deal,
Sam dies, right?</i>

291
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:40,865
<i>- What?
Well, I know a way out.</i>

292
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,415
<i>- For both of you.
- How?</i>

293
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,374
<i>The demon who holds your contract.</i>

294
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:47,462
<i>He's here. Now.</i>

295
00:20:54,986 --> 00:20:56,528
What's up?

296
00:20:56,696 --> 00:21:00,315
Girl, Lanie, her mom's ghost
spooked her out pretty bad last night.

297
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,201
- That sucks.
- Yeah, it does.

298
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,943
- What are you doing?
- I think Dad's right.

299
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:07,162
I think the demon is here.

300
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,662
Check it out.

301
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:17,008
- What is this, weather reports?
- Omens. Demonic omens.

302
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:20,464
Electrical storms everywhere we've been
for the past two weeks.

303
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,679
I don't remember any lightning storms.

304
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:25,931
I don't remember you
studying meteorology as a kid, either.

305
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:28,262
But I'm telling you,
that bastard's been tailing me...

306
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:30,148
...wearing some poor dude's meat.

307
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:34,772
And it's following you because...?

308
00:21:34,947 --> 00:21:38,814
I guess I'm big game, you know?
My ass is too sweet to let out of sight.

309
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:40,191
Okay, sure.

310
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:45,206
Don't get too excited, Sammy.
Might pull something.

311
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:49,378
- Dean, I wanna believe this. I really do...
- Then believe it.

312
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:53,750
- Lf we get this sucker, it's Miller Time.
- Yeah, that's another thing.

313
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:56,168
Dad rattles off an exorcism
that can kill a demon.

314
00:21:56,345 --> 00:22:00,046
- Not just send it back to hell, but kill it?
- I've checked it out.

315
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:02,550
This is heavy-duty Dark Ages.

316
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:04,519
Fifteenth century.

317
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:08,105
Yeah, I checked on it too, Dean.
And so did Bobby.

318
00:22:10,485 --> 00:22:11,944
Okay. And?

319
00:22:12,112 --> 00:22:14,687
Look, it definitely is an exorcism, okay?

320
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:18,116
There's just no evidence
that it can kill a demon.

321
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:20,029
- No evidence it can't.
- Oh, Dean, come on...

322
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,371
Hey, as far as I know, the only one of us
that's actually been to hell is Dad.

323
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,460
Maybe he picked up a couple of tricks
there, like which exorcisms work.

324
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:27,660
Maybe it does, okay?

325
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:30,508
- I hope it does too, but we gotta be sure.
- Why aren't we sure?

326
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:33,344
Because I don't know
what's going on around here, Dean.

327
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:37,177
I mean, some guy blows his brains out,
a little girl is scared out of her wits.

328
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:40,136
Wow, man, a couple of civvies
are freaked out by some ghosts.

329
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,430
News flash, Sam, people are supposed
to be freaked out by ghosts.

330
00:22:48,861 --> 00:22:51,648
- Dad tell you where to find the demon?
- I'm waiting on the call.

331
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:56,944
I told Lanie I'd stop by.

332
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,612
Oh, good, yeah.

333
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,123
No, you go hang out with jailbait.
Just, uh, watch out for Chris Hansen.

334
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:07,208
Meanwhile, I'll be here, you know,
getting ready to save my life.

335
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:13,377
You are unbelievable, you know that?

336
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:16,390
I mean, for months we've been trying
to break this demon deal.

337
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:18,052
Dad's about to give us the address...

338
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:21,347
...and you can't accept it? He's dead
and you're still butting heads.

339
00:23:21,522 --> 00:23:23,147
- That's not what it's about.
- Then what?

340
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:26,103
The fact is,
we got no hard proof here, Dean.

341
00:23:26,277 --> 00:23:29,148
After everything,
you're still just going on blind faith.

342
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:32,738
Yeah, well, maybe.
You know, maybe that's all I got, okay?

343
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:38,664
Please.

344
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:43,499
Just please don't go anywhere
until I get back, okay, Dean?

345
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:45,296
Please.

346
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,820
Have you told your father
about any of this?

347
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,735
And bother him at work?

348
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,942
No.

349
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,446
He wouldn't believe me.
He'd just chuck me into therapy.

350
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:17,201
So, what did your mother say?

351
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:19,782
That she wanted to see me.

352
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:22,368
So at first I thought
I was supposed to go to the cemetery.

353
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:24,956
- Did you?
- Nothing happened.

354
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:30,758
But then she started
asking me to do other things.

355
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:32,593
What sort of things?

356
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:35,675
Bad things.

357
00:24:54,832 --> 00:24:57,122
Hello? Simon Greenfield speaking.

358
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:00,171
Hi, Mommy.

359
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:03,505
Yeah, I wanna see you. Where are you?

360
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:13,263
<i>- Dad?
Dean.</i>

361
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:14,716
Where's the demon?

362
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,021
Lanie, please.

363
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,026
Tell me what happened.
It's very important.

364
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:23,029
Mom told me to go
to Dad's medicine cabinet.

365
00:25:23,197 --> 00:25:24,311
And?

366
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,823
Take his sleeping pills.
Take all his sleeping pills.

367
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,319
She wanted you to kill yourself?

368
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,876
Why would my mom want me to do that?

369
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:38,456
I don't know.

370
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,834
I mean, just so I could come to her?

371
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:44,423
What'd you say?

372
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:45,924
She wanted me to come to her.

373
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:48,173
No, no, no. How did she say it exactly?

374
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:51,102
"Come to me. " Like, a million times.

375
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:57,024
Lanie.

376
00:25:57,484 --> 00:25:58,765
That's not your mother.

377
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,591
Listen to me. Don't answer the phone.
Don't use the computer.

378
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:32,605
Don't do anything
unless I say to, all right?

379
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,310
Lanie.

380
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:37,479
Where's Simon?

381
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,123
Hello?

382
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:34,662
Dean, it's not Dad.

383
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:36,584
<i>What is it?
- A crocotta.</i>

384
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,919
<i>That a sandwich?
- Scavenger. Mimics loved ones.</i>

385
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:40,127
Whispers, "Come to me. "

386
00:27:40,306 --> 00:27:42,512
Then lures you into the dark
and swallows your soul.

387
00:27:42,683 --> 00:27:44,426
<i>Crocotta, right. That makes sense.</i>

388
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:48,219
<i>- I'm sorry, man.
Don't these things live in filth?</i>

389
00:27:48,397 --> 00:27:51,565
<i>- Yeah.
The flies at the phone company.</i>

390
00:28:30,944 --> 00:28:33,233
<i>It's Herman Munster. Leave a message.</i>

391
00:28:33,823 --> 00:28:36,492
Dean, I'm in the parking lot.
He's here. Hurry.

392
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:46,700
Whoa, what the hell?

393
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:48,670
- I know what you are.
- Wait, mister.

394
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:51,875
- And I know how to kill you.
- Please. Okay, wait, wait.

395
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,969
If we're overcharging you
for the call waiting or something...

396
00:28:55,138 --> 00:28:57,344
...I can fix that, I'm your friend.

397
00:28:57,515 --> 00:29:00,635
Please. Just... Just don't kill me.

398
00:29:01,185 --> 00:29:02,893
Don't kill me, please.

399
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,234
Yeah, ha, ha.

400
00:29:08,402 --> 00:29:12,316
That's what happens when you mess
with the phone company, dillweed.

401
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,481
Thank you, Clark.

402
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,694
Forget about it.

403
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:22,583
Clark?

404
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:38,102
L... I'm sorry, Clark.
I'm sorry for whatever I did to you.

405
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,020
- I'm sorry. Please...
Wait.

406
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,937
Wait. Don't do it.

407
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,823
You're awake.

408
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,697
You're not a killer, Clark. No.

409
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,364
There's a good man inside of you.
I know it.

410
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,666
What do you think, Sammy?

411
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:56,664
Am I a good man?

412
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,213
Just let him go.

413
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:02,919
I would. I really would.

414
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:05,759
If only I'd had more than a salad
for lunch.

415
00:30:06,182 --> 00:30:07,724
You see?

416
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:09,305
I'm starving.

417
00:30:09,477 --> 00:30:10,936
No!

418
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,930
My last call with Dean...

419
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:48,304
...that was you.

420
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:50,306
You led me here.

421
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:57,232
Some calls I make, some calls I take.

422
00:30:57,905 --> 00:31:02,117
But you have to admit,
I had you fooled for a while.

423
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:05,705
All that Edison phone crap.

424
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:08,623
Oh, well.

425
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:13,994
What are you doing?

426
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:19,086
I'm killing your brother.

427
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:22,629
Or maybe I'm killing another guy.

428
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:25,722
We'll just have to see how it goes.

429
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:41,318
<i>- Hello?
Hi, Daddy.</i>

430
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:44,913
Hey, baby.

431
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,243
I thought you said
you weren't gonna call anymore.

432
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,543
<i>I know, Daddy.</i>

433
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:55,093
You know how sad
this makes your old man.

434
00:31:57,303 --> 00:31:59,712
How upset I was at your funeral.

435
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:03,508
<i>I had to call.
I know who killed me, Daddy.</i>

436
00:32:04,728 --> 00:32:06,009
What?

437
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:09,604
<i>The man who killed me.
He's at the house right now.</i>

438
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:12,349
What? What are you saying to me?

439
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:16,740
<i>He's at the house, Daddy.
He wants to kill you too.</i>

440
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:27,707
You know, mimicking Dean's one thing.

441
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:30,666
But my dad, that's a hell of a trick.

442
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:34,377
Well, once I made you two as hunters,
it was easy.

443
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:39,639
Found Dean's number...

444
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:43,178
...then your number,
then your father's numbers.

445
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,644
Then to e-mails, voice mails.

446
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:49,015
Everything.

447
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:53,561
You see, people think
that that stuff just gets erased.

448
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:55,484
But it doesn't.

449
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,859
You'd be surprised at how much
of yourself is just floating out there...

450
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:03,321
...waiting to be plucked.

451
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:05,909
Dean's not gonna fall for this.

452
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:08,708
He's not gonna kill that guy.

453
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,416
Then the guy kills him.

454
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:31,880
Technology.

455
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:37,390
Makes life so much easier.

456
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:45,028
Used to be I'd hide in the woods
for days, weeks...

457
00:34:45,196 --> 00:34:47,354
...whispering to people.

458
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:50,862
Trying to draw them out into the night.

459
00:34:52,245 --> 00:34:54,534
But they had community.

460
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,661
They all looked out after each other.

461
00:34:57,835 --> 00:35:01,085
I'd be lucky to eat maybe one,
two souls a year.

462
00:35:02,005 --> 00:35:06,300
But now when I'm hungry,
I simply make a phone call.

463
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:09,043
You're all so connected.

464
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:13,267
But you've never been so alone.

465
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:52,843
- What is this?
- Your funeral.

466
00:36:01,571 --> 00:36:04,109
You do this to my daughter too?

467
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:08,112
- How the hell did you get out?
- You do this to my daughter too?

468
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:10,079
- Wait. This is a mistake.
- You killed her.

469
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:12,406
- No. Wait.
- You killed her, you son of a bitch.

470
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,162
She was 9 years old!

471
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,879
Stop. I didn't.

472
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,006
You gotta believe me.

473
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:06,839
Why did you kill her?

474
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:08,429
I'm sorry.

475
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,228
I didn't kill your daughter.

476
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:14,647
Then what are you doing here?

477
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:20,149
I don't know.

478
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:37,197
I see they improved your face.

479
00:37:38,585 --> 00:37:40,412
Yeah, right back at you.

480
00:37:45,217 --> 00:37:46,960
So crocotta, huh?

481
00:37:47,135 --> 00:37:48,168
Yep.

482
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:50,137
That would explain the flies.

483
00:37:50,306 --> 00:37:51,884
Yeah, it would.

484
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:57,095
Hey, um...

485
00:37:57,814 --> 00:37:59,854
Look, I'm sorry it wasn't Dad.

486
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:03,317
No, I gave you a hell of a time
on this one.

487
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:05,645
- Ahh.
- No, you were right.

488
00:38:05,823 --> 00:38:07,531
Forget about it.

489
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:10,198
I can't.

490
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:15,788
I wanted to believe so badly
that there was a way out of this.

491
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:20,671
I mean, I'm staring down
the barrel at this thing.

492
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,793
You know, hell.

493
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,672
For real, forever. And I'm just...

494
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,212
Yeah.

495
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,476
I'm scared, Sam.

496
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:38,518
I'm really scared.

497
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,986
I know.

498
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:48,446
I guess I was willing to believe anything.

499
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,696
You know, last act of a desperate man.

500
00:38:50,872 --> 00:38:55,167
- There's nothing wrong with having hope.
- No. Hope doesn't get you jack squat.

501
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:59,666
I can't expect Dad to show up
with some miracle at the last minute.

502
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,378
I can't expect anybody to, you know?

503
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:07,174
And the only person
that can get me out of this thing is me.

504
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:12,388
And me.

505
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,779
- "And me"?
- What?

506
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:23,611
Deep revelation, having a real moment,
that's what you come back with?

507
00:39:23,783 --> 00:39:25,492
"And me"?

508
00:39:25,953 --> 00:39:27,613
- Do you want a poem?
- Moment's gone.

509
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,742
Unbelievable.

510
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:36,870
<i>- So must I. I have a lot of work to do.</i>

511
00:39:37,048 --> 00:39:39,373
<i>At this rate, it won't take long.</i>
