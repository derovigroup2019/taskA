1
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:05,328
What do you say we kill some
evil sons of bitches and raise hell?

2
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:13,583
- You're offering up your soul?
- All you gotta do is bring Sam back.

3
00:00:13,758 --> 00:00:15,632
- How long did they give you?
- One year.

4
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:17,842
- I don't wanna go to hell.
- We'll save you.

5
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:20,884
Ed Zeddmore and Harry Spengler.
Hellhoundslair. Com.

6
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:25,221
- What're you doing?
- The hell are you doing?

7
00:00:25,397 --> 00:00:29,098
We belong here. We're professional
paranormal investigators.

8
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:31,815
We're just trying to get
a book-and-movie deal, okay?

9
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:36,107
- Get that damn thing out of my face.
Go, go!

10
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:39,903
<i>Sweet Lord of the Rings. Run!</i>

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,580
- I'm not going back in there.
- Harry, this is our ticket to the big time.

12
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:47,999
The fame, money, sex. With girls.

13
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,008
Hello.

14
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:58,516
- I am Harry Spengler.
- And I am Ed Zeddmore.

15
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:03,312
Now, if you've received this tape, you
must be some bigwig network executive.

16
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:06,188
Well, today is your lucky day, mister.

17
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,982
Because the unsolicited pilot
you are about to watch...

18
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:12,525
...is the bold new future
of "reality TV."

19
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:16,071
Mm. We know you've had it hard
during the writers' strike.

20
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:17,659
Lazy fat cats.

21
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,502
Who needs writers
when you got guys like us?

22
00:01:20,669 --> 00:01:25,628
Our team faced horrible horrors
to bring you the footage...

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,256
...that will change your world forever.

24
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:33,424
So strap in for the scariest hour
in the history of television.

25
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:36,271
In the history of your life.

26
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:37,897
Strap in for...

27
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:41,358
<i>...Ghostfacers.</i>

28
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:47,517
<i>You know, it can get kind of hard
balancing our daytime careers...</i>

29
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:49,347
<i>...with our nighttime missions.</i>

30
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:53,306
<i>But Ed and I pretty much call
the shots at the Kinko's where we work.</i>

31
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:56,024
<i>So we can usually pretty much
get off by 6.</i>

32
00:02:56,197 --> 00:02:57,395
<i>- Every night.
Yeah, 6:00.</i>

33
00:02:57,573 --> 00:03:01,025
It used to be just, you know,
you and I taking on the cases.

34
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:03,361
- Just Harry and me.
- Two lone wolves.

35
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:06,409
And two lone wolves need, uh...

36
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,791
...other wolves.

37
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:15,962
- Morning, Facers.
- Good morning, Ghostfacers.

38
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:17,512
It's 7 p. m., dude.

39
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,637
It's morning to a Ghostfacer.

40
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:22,559
- Corbett, what we got, buddy?
I'm just putting up some...

41
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:25,135
This has gotta go here,
gotta see the whole field.

42
00:03:25,313 --> 00:03:27,106
Markers, eraser, good job.

43
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:30,690
I first saw Ed, uh...

44
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:36,367
...putting up flyers
down at the outlet mall in Scogan.

45
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:41,198
So I read one and I thought to myself:

46
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:44,541
"Huh. Where do ghosts come from?"

47
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:48,211
And now, here I am.

48
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:55,390
Oh, ow! Ed, your sister's abusing staff.

49
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:58,226
That's adopted sister,
thank you very much.

50
00:03:58,393 --> 00:04:01,479
Ed has been obsessed with
the supernatural since we were kids...

51
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:03,973
...you know,
and then he meets Harry...

52
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,318
...at computer camp
and love at first geek.

53
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,068
Spruce here.

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,326
What up, player?

55
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:16,330
I am fifteen-sixteenths Jew...

56
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:20,449
...one-sixteenth Cherokee.
My grandfather is a mohel.

57
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:24,127
My great-grandfather
was a talus maker.

58
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:28,083
And my great-great-grandfather
was a degenerate gambler...

59
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:31,216
...and, uh, had a peyote addiction.

60
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,760
Okay, people, let's cut the chatter
and get on a mission.

61
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:36,681
Okay.

62
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:37,970
Morton House.

63
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:42,768
One of our big fish.

64
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,654
All right, we all know the legend.

65
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:46,899
Every four years,
supposedly this becomes...

66
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:49,483
...the most haunted place in America.

67
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,082
The leap-year ghost some call it.

68
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:57,459
The ghost returns at midnight
just as February 29th begins.

69
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:01,164
- And no one has ever stayed the night.
- Yeah, every testimony we dug up...

70
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:03,750
...every eyewitness has run
well before midnight.

71
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:07,344
- That's all about to change, isn't it, baby?
- Absolutely true, Ed.

72
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,757
- Absolutely true.
- Mm, that's good.

73
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:15,096
French vanilla, because the other day
you said how much you liked it, so...

74
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,935
Thank you.

75
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,893
You are welcome.

76
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:28,530
I like Corbett, I do. Um...

77
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:30,996
Shows up early, does his job.

78
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:33,410
A lot of good hustle out...

79
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:43,255
I think he's got the hots for Ed
and that could spell trouble for the team.

80
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:48,937
Ed's kind of the more rugged,
with that really golden...

81
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:52,898
...beautiful sort of beard. Ha, ha.

82
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:56,734
Uh, and Harry's nice.

83
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,531
Twenty-ninth...

84
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,529
...is this Friday, Facers.

85
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:03,739
We want this mission, we gotta
move on it now, or guess what.

86
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:06,073
He's gone for another four years.

87
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,041
- What's this?
Wait a minute.

88
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,370
Watch out. Oh.

89
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:14,882
- Oh, Dad, come on!
Let's just cut the cameras.

90
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:17,129
We don't need that.
We don't need this part.

91
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:26,980
Stay low. Follow formation.

92
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:31,187
Okay, as expected.

93
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,693
A lot of people have tried to break into
the Morton House.

94
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:37,156
The local authorities
have just gotten fed up.

95
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:41,409
Looks like the cops have got this place
pretty well fenced off.

96
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:44,752
Wait. Didn't you guys get, like,
a permit or something?

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,328
A permit?
That's a good idea for next time.

98
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,049
Yeah.

99
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,667
Car, car.

100
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,087
Flashlights off.
Corbett!

101
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:56,174
Okay, okay.

102
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:01,098
Hey, hey, hey. Shh.

103
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:03,764
Be totally still.

104
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:24,421
It's okay. Not cops, just hicks.

105
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,215
Not cops, not cops.
Ed.

106
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:29,386
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Ed's got it, Ed's got it.

107
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,382
Guys, let's go, let's go, let's go.

108
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:32,636
- Go.
Let's go.

109
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:33,889
Go, Spruce.

110
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:39,522
Still, be quiet.

111
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:49,745
There's the kitchen sink.
Copy that.

112
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,376
All right, everybody.
Ghostfacers, let's line up.

113
00:07:57,546 --> 00:07:58,744
Everybody.

114
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:02,174
We're gonna set up camp right here.
This is Command Center 1.

115
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:03,802
We call this the Eagle's Nest.

116
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:24,617
Hallway, Cam 1 up and running.

117
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:25,949
Looking good, Corbett.

118
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:29,829
Copy that, Ed.

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,709
Uh...

120
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,499
Uh, you're welcome.
Spruce, how are we doing there, buddy?

121
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:36,879
<i>Checking basement, Camera 2,
mein F?hrer.</i>

122
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,878
Maggie, I got no visual on you,
Maggie.

123
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:40,796
<i>- Do you copy?
There you are.</i>

124
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:43,130
<i>- Harry, you alive?
Upstairs den, Camera 1.</i>

125
00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:45,135
<i>Good, good. I can smell syndication.</i>

126
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,145
All right, fellas,
let's regroup at the Eagle's Nest.

127
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:51,482
- Hey, Spengler.
Right there.

128
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:53,061
- Battery check.
Check.

129
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:55,359
- Check. Check.
Okay.

130
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,810
Look at Corbett.

131
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:59,149
Yo, Corbett, dude.
- Looking good, Corbett.

132
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:01,319
You're Robocop.
- Robocop?

133
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:04,413
- You think I look like Robocop?
Everybody, bring it in.

134
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:07,156
We've all been here before.
Standard walk-through.

135
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:08,877
- Team one, west.
Okay.

136
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:10,955
- Team two, east.
- Got it.

137
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:14,049
Spin the tires, light the fires.
Ghostfacers on three.

138
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:17,718
One, two, three, Ghostfacers!

139
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,267
Hello?

140
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,527
I'm speaking to the restless spirits
of the Morton House.

141
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,360
- Let's go in.
Okay.

142
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,488
Okay.

143
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:38,867
Hello?

144
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,497
My name's Ed.

145
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:46,545
Careful.

146
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:49,248
Watch your back.

147
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:52,842
Okay. Okay. Look over there.

148
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:56,096
What's your name?

149
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:59,641
0.3, 0.29.

150
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:04,274
Is there an entity or entities here
with us now?

151
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:06,815
- Give us a sign of your presence.
- Breathe, buddy.

152
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:08,482
- I can't breathe.
- Corbett, you...

153
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:14,031
Corbett, night vision.

154
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,206
Okay. Okay, okay, I got it. Okay.

155
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,417
- Okay.
- Calm down. Breathe. Okay?

156
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,291
- What?
- Calm the whirlwinds of your mind.

157
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,172
We're doing a basic EMF, EVP,
temp-flux sweep.

158
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:34,184
Looks like we got all of our ducks
in a row here.

159
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:45,604
Whoa.
- What?

160
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:48,903
Oh. This camera's fritzing or something.

161
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,950
That's weird.

162
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:55,491
It's gone.

163
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,087
Get this, get this.

164
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:05,719
Turn the knob.
- All right, that's a good idea.

165
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,177
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

166
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:12,721
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

167
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:14,607
It's just a rat, dude.

168
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,055
I don't really like rats.

169
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:18,730
They're gross.

170
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:22,025
Rats are like the rats of the world.

171
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,616
Was that a...? Was that an apparition?
Was that a spectral? A 0.4?

172
00:11:25,787 --> 00:11:29,572
What do we got? Because the EMP
was just off the... Oh, God!

173
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,790
Oh, that is so not funny, Spruce!

174
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:41,719
Oh, God. Okay, it was just...
I think it was just this branch.

175
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,559
Okay. In the window.

176
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:47,681
- This is spooky, man.
- It's pretty spooky.

177
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:51,523
Aah!
Freeze! Police officers!

178
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:53,318
Oh, God.

179
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:55,313
Take it easy.
Let's see identification.

180
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:57,528
- Come on. Let's see some ID.
Why are we...?

181
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,491
- Are we under arrest?
We are unarmed.

182
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,238
Oh, God. Oh, God.

183
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:04,532
You want to explain that weirdo outfit,
Mr., uh, Corbett?

184
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:08,077
- Uh...
- Whoa. I know you.

185
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:10,211
Yeah, sure you do.
Give me some identification.

186
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,919
Hold on a second.
I know the both of you guys. Yeah.

187
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,919
What?
- Yeah.

188
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,212
<i>Holy * * * *.</i>

189
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:19,014
What?

190
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:22,350
Uh, west Texas,
the tulpa we had to take out.

191
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,763
Those two goofballs
that almost got us killed.

192
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,143
Uh, Hellhounds or something?

193
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:32,605
<i>- * * * * me.
- Yeah. We're not Hellhounds anymore.</i>

194
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:34,739
- Didn't test that well.
- What's going on?

195
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:35,940
They're not cops. No.

196
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,955
Ed, thought you had a partner,
didn't you? A different guy?

197
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:40,534
Yeah.
Is he here?

198
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,115
Running around, chasing ghosts.
- Okay, listen.

199
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,583
You and Rambo need to get
your girlfriends and get out.

200
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:47,748
Ha-ha-ha. All right.

201
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:50,131
Listen here, chisel chest, okay?

202
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,761
We were here first.

203
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:53,922
We've already set up base camp.

204
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:56,091
We beat you.

205
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:58,386
- They were here first.
Mm-hm. Ha, ha.

206
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,805
Oh, God!

207
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,261
- Ed?
- Yeah?

208
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:03,472
Where's your partner?

209
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:09,604
Ten-six, ten-seven.
Guys, the EMF is really spiking here.

210
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:12,903
Temperature's down 11 degrees.
Keep your eyes peeled.

211
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,703
This could be it.

212
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:17,828
Maggie, can I get a reading in here,
please?

213
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:22,581
Something keeps messing
with the chip.

214
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:24,714
I don't know what's going on here.

215
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:28,753
- Guys. Guys. Guys.
What is this?

216
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,059
Look, buddy, I'm sorry. That's it.
I'm telling you, that's all the money I...

217
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,819
What're you doing at
the Morton House? On leap year?

218
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,783
We're here to spend the night, okay?
It's for our TV show.

219
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,784
What? Great. Perfect.

220
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,080
- Nobody's spent the night before.
- Uh, actually, yeah, they have.

221
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,500
Uh, we've never heard of them.

222
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:02,090
Yeah, you know why? The ones that
have, haven't lived to talk about it.

223
00:14:02,262 --> 00:14:04,135
Oh, come on, I don't believe you.

224
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:07,721
Look, missing-persons reports
going back almost a half century.

225
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:11,594
Uh, John Graham
stayed on a dare: Gone.

226
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:14,441
Julie Wilkerson: Gone.
There are tons more.

227
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:17,396
All of them came to stay the night,
always on a leap year.

228
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:20,774
The only body they ever found
was the last owner, Freeman Daggett.

229
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,777
These look legit.
- They are legit.

230
00:14:22,952 --> 00:14:24,363
And we ain't got much time.

231
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:27,028
Starting at midnight,
your friends are going to die.

232
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:29,247
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

233
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:32,419
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Guys! Guys! Oh, my God!

234
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:33,702
Oh, my God, we got one!

235
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,340
- Corbett! We saw it.
What?

236
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,884
A full apparition!
- Get out.

237
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:40,967
- It was a Class 4, a spectral illumination.
It was absolutely amazing.

238
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:46,300
<i>Hey, aren't those the * * * * * * * *
from Texas?</i>

239
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,511
Yes.

240
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:49,682
Let's have this reunion
across the street.

241
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:52,016
What are you doing here?
- Get you ice cream.

242
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:55,611
- What do you say? Let's go.
Guys, I think you should listen...

243
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:58,818
No, no, no. Look at this.
The honest-to-God proof, all right?

244
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:03,953
Are you kidding me?
No, not kidding you.

245
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:05,832
- We got ghosts.
- What reading did we get?

246
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:08,078
- Uh, it was a 10.9.
10.9?

247
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:11,670
Yeah, it was 10.9, it was almost 11.
And I was like, "What's going on?"

248
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:13,965
- And I was...
Hold on, watch this part.

249
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:16,046
Oh!
He got blasted.

250
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:18,096
It was crazy.
Oh, my God.

251
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:24,678
What's a death echo?

252
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,396
Look, if we got a problem here,
that ghost ain't it.

253
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:31,151
That's real. Like, that happened.
What's a death echo?

254
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:33,363
Echoes are trapped in a loop, okay?

255
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:36,203
They keep replaying how they died
over and over again...

256
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,120
...usually in the place where they were
ganked. As dangerous as a scary movie.

257
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:42,580
The echo's not dangerous,
but something else is.

258
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,829
- You're right.
- We need to get out. Come on.

259
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:46,749
- Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go, guys.

260
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:48,882
Guys, time is running out.

261
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:53,295
But what about our equipment?
What are we gonna...?

262
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,929
We got the material.
We got all kinds of stuff.

263
00:15:56,101 --> 00:15:59,554
- We'll make you recurring guest stars.
Wait! Wait! Wait!

264
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:01,895
Where's Corbett?

265
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:05,401
I wish to communicate
with the restless spirits here.

266
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:18,074
Oh. Lights out.
I think I got night-vision here.

267
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:24,759
That's better.

268
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:26,125
No man left behind.

269
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:31,098
That was Corbett.
- Come in, Corbett.

270
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:34,019
Tell Corbett we'll get him.
Corbett, don't worry!

271
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:35,563
Guys.

272
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,439
<i>* * * * you!</i>

273
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:38,771
Where are you, dude?

274
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:41,066
- Tell us where you are!
Corbett!

275
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:44,109
Let me go! Aah! Guys!

276
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:46,571
- Come back, Corbett.
- Aah!

277
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:47,942
Hey, hey, hey! Come on.

278
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:51,160
Hey, hey, hey!

279
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:58,256
Hey, Corbett's...

280
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:00,298
He's not here.
Let's go. Let's go back.

281
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,752
No, no, no. That was Corbett.
Didn't you hear that?

282
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,219
Sam, get them out of here.
Let's go, come on.

283
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,717
- There we go. Keep it moving.
Looking good.

284
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,934
Corbett?
All right.

285
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:12,683
Hey. Come on, let's go.
Hey.

286
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:14,601
Watch him. Watch him.
- Take a left.

287
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:17,612
Move, move. Let's go. Turn it off.

288
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,271
Oh, God, what's happened?

289
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:23,155
Oh, God. He's gone.

290
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:24,526
He just disappeared.

291
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:27,030
Let's go through all the angles,
all the cameras.

292
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:29,781
- It's 12:04, Dean. Good? You happy?
- Yeah, I am happy.

293
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:32,630
"Let's go hunt the Morton House.
It's our Grand Canyon. "

294
00:17:32,797 --> 00:17:35,122
I don't wanna hear it.
You got two months left.

295
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:38,634
- Instead, we're gonna die tonight.
Whoa, whoa!

296
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:41,425
- What is going on, guys?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

297
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:45,644
Every door, every window, every exit
out of this house, they're all sealed.

298
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:48,600
- Why are they sealed?
- It's a supernatural lockdown, okay?

299
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:51,016
Whatever took Corbett
doesn't want us to leave.

300
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:54,313
And it's no death echo,
this is a bad mother. It wants us scared.

301
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:56,897
Or it just wants us.

302
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,286
Uh, guys, the camera's fritzing again.

303
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,410
Whoa. Guys, the EMF's starting to spike.

304
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,995
- This is a big one.
Ed.

305
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,412
Everybody stay close,
there's something coming.

306
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,332
Guys.

307
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:13,592
Uh, whoa.
Okay, let's... Let's just stay...

308
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,754
Whoa!

309
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:18,682
Guys, is this the same echo
you guys saw earlier?

310
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,805
- No, it's a different guy.
- Multiple echoes? What's going on?

311
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:23,224
Beats me.

312
00:18:23,397 --> 00:18:25,141
Okay. All right, all right, all right.

313
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:28,022
Uh, hey, buddy! Hey, hey.

314
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:30,234
Wake up. You're dead!

315
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:32,695
- Hello?
- What's he doing? What's he doing?

316
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:35,239
Sometimes you can shock
an echo out of its loop...

317
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:37,784
...if you can talk to the part
that's still human.

318
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:40,874
But usually you have to have
some connection to the deceased.

319
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:43,534
Come on, wake up! Be dead! Huh?

320
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:46,630
Hey! Hey!
- You guys hear that?

321
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,839
- What's that sound?
- You guys hear that?

322
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,501
What is that?
- Snap out of it, buddy, huh?

323
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,222
What are you waiting for?
You're dead.

324
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,389
Oh!
Where the hell did it go?

325
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:10,153
There's no records of this.

326
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:13,282
No one got shot here, no one got
run over by a train. Stay close.

327
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:14,950
Did the echoes take Corbett?

328
00:19:15,124 --> 00:19:17,449
Yes... No. We don't know
what's doing what here...

329
00:19:17,627 --> 00:19:20,913
...that's what we're trying to figure out.
Stay close.

330
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,086
Okay, look, um,
death echoes are ghosts, okay?

331
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,048
Now, ghosts usually haunt places
where they lived or died.

332
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:30,262
Except these mooks
didn't live or die here.

333
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,226
Right.
What are they doing here?

334
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:34,968
Hey, give the lady a cigar.

335
00:19:35,147 --> 00:19:37,187
Does looking at this
through that camera...

336
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:39,601
...make you feel better or something?
I mean...

337
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,447
Um... I, uh...

338
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,533
- Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, I think so. Mm-hm.
- Oh.

339
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:06,881
Freeman Daggett, house's last owner.

340
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:09,550
Officially commended for 20 years
of fine service...

341
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:13,146
...at the Gamble General Hospital.
He's a doctor?

342
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:15,150
Janitor.

343
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:17,484
This looks like his den.

344
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:20,146
- When did you say he died? '64?
- Yeah. Heart attack.

345
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:24,406
What are these, C rations?
Army-issued, three squares.

346
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,988
Like, a lifetime supply.

347
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,124
God, is that all he ate?

348
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:31,536
One-stop shopping.

349
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,620
Hello. Locked.

350
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,755
Come on, guys, this is ridiculous.
How is this supposed to find Corbett?

351
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:41,677
Huh? We should be digging up
the frigging floorboards right now.

352
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:46,228
<i>Huh. Survival Under Atomic Attack.</i>

353
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,476
An optimist.

354
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,204
Crap.

355
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:06,919
Crap.

356
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:09,080
Taxidermy. Okay.

357
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:12,258
- You said Daggett was a hospital janitor?
Yeah.

358
00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:13,921
Ew.

359
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:15,506
We got three toe tags here.

360
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,722
One, death by gunshots,
train accident, and suicide.

361
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:23,974
Ew.

362
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,726
What?

363
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:29,319
Well, that explains
why all the death echoes are here.

364
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,237
They're here because
their bodies are here.

365
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:38,448
- Somewhere in the house.
- What?

366
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:43,536
Daggett brought the remains home
from the morgue to play.

367
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,510
Ew!

368
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:50,919
That's nasty, dude.

369
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:52,211
Right.

370
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:53,848
Wait a minute.

371
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:56,804
Corbett.

372
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:06,190
Okay, Maggie.

373
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:16,497
- Closer to the herd, okay?
Maggie?

374
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,707
- Maggie?
She's fine.

375
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:22,829
Harry, I got an 8.6 and climbing
fast. Something huge is coming. Look.

376
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,337
Something big is coming.

377
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,885
It's past 11, you guys.

378
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,964
What is happening?
Nobody move.

379
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,631
Hold on, hold on. Stay quiet.

380
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,221
- What's going on? Sam?
Ed.

381
00:22:35,398 --> 00:22:36,976
Must be the surge.

382
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,395
Sam?

383
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:40,528
Where'd he go?

384
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:42,356
Oh, no.

385
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:44,866
Oh.

386
00:22:49,164 --> 00:22:51,073
Sam!

387
00:22:56,103 --> 00:22:57,218
Sammy!
Sam!

388
00:22:57,313 --> 00:22:59,983
Yo! Talk to us!
Corbett, Corbett!

389
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,229
- Sammy!
Sam?

390
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:03,441
Corbett, Corbett!

391
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,441
Corbett!

392
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:09,533
- Corbett!
- Sam!

393
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:13,904
God, I am so scared.

394
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,449
I'm so scared.

395
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:18,002
It's gonna be okay.

396
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,042
It's gonna be okay, Maggie.

397
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:31,217
Corbett!

398
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:41,486
Whoa.

399
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:54,000
My best friend...

400
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:56,165
...and my best sister.
Ed.

401
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:57,419
- Harry.
- Ed.

402
00:23:57,591 --> 00:23:59,051
- Harry.
- Ed. Listen, Ed...

403
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:00,547
Are you banging my sister?

404
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:03,002
No.

405
00:24:03,181 --> 00:24:04,890
No.

406
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:07,765
- Hold my glasses.
You got it.

407
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,606
Ed, Ed, Ed!

408
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:14,107
Guys. Guys.
Ed, get off. You guys, stop.

409
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:16,649
You guys are in trouble.
Hey, hey, hey!

410
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,610
<i>The * * * * are you doing?</i>

411
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:20,443
Cut it out!

412
00:24:20,618 --> 00:24:23,156
We're down by two people.

413
00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:26,576
Sam!

414
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,161
Great.

415
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:29,794
Sammy!

416
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:31,671
Sorry.

417
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:35,839
I'm sorry.

418
00:24:38,013 --> 00:24:39,556
You got my glasses.

419
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:42,014
- He got my tooth there?
Uh, no.

420
00:24:42,184 --> 00:24:44,972
- I won that, right?
Yup, you're good.

421
00:24:48,608 --> 00:24:50,935
- Thanks, Spruce.
Yeah, it's my fault.

422
00:24:51,112 --> 00:24:53,021
Great. That's nice. Thanks.

423
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:00,204
Corbett.

424
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:03,499
Corbett.

425
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,534
Corbett.

426
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,705
Hey. Wake up, man.

427
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,040
Corbett, hey.

428
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,676
- Corbett, hey.
Sam?

429
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,050
You gotta keep listening
to my voice, okay?

430
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,882
I'm right here.

431
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:17,303
Stay awake.

432
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:19,018
Don't listen to him.

433
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,649
It stops hurting, so don't worry.

434
00:25:27,237 --> 00:25:28,482
Corbett, stay with me.

435
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:30,695
Stay with me, you got it?
I'm right here.

436
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:33,571
Hey. Stay with me. Don't.

437
00:25:33,744 --> 00:25:36,153
Don't. No!

438
00:25:36,706 --> 00:25:37,904
Corbett!

439
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,205
Corbett!

440
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,588
- Corbett!
Where'd you go?

441
00:25:52,766 --> 00:25:54,593
Where are you guys?

442
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,767
Dean, what are you doing?
Daggett was a Cold-War nut.

443
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:02,148
He was an amateur taxidermist.

444
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,570
He liked to slow dance with cadavers
and all he ate was C rations.

445
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,899
- So what are we looking for?
A horrible life.

446
00:26:08,076 --> 00:26:09,950
A lonely life.

447
00:26:10,454 --> 00:26:12,446
A Cold-War life.

448
00:26:13,498 --> 00:26:15,124
He was scared.

449
00:26:15,293 --> 00:26:17,784
- He was scared. He was scared.
Scared of what?

450
00:26:17,962 --> 00:26:19,373
What?
Where are you going?

451
00:26:19,547 --> 00:26:21,920
Don't leave me in here. Guys.
Wait. Dean!

452
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:23,207
Get away from me.

453
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:25,129
This won't hurt.

454
00:26:25,304 --> 00:26:27,974
It's okay. It's okay.

455
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,885
Relax.

456
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,052
Relax.

457
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:40,733
Where are you going?

458
00:26:40,906 --> 00:26:43,907
Guys like Daggett back then,
the ones scared of the Russkies...

459
00:26:44,076 --> 00:26:45,404
...they built bomb shelters.

460
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:46,907
I'm guessing he's got one.

461
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:49,704
I'll bet you it's in the basement.

462
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:53,409
Whoa!

463
00:26:53,587 --> 00:26:55,545
That is not funny. How many times...?

464
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,837
Uh, who closed the door?
It did.

465
00:26:58,008 --> 00:26:59,253
It wants to separate us.

466
00:26:59,427 --> 00:27:02,263
Ed, listen to me.
There's some salt in my duffle.

467
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,008
Make a circle and get inside.

468
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:10,640
- Inside his...?
- That's stupid.

469
00:27:10,815 --> 00:27:12,013
Inside your duffle bag?

470
00:27:12,191 --> 00:27:13,390
In the salt, you idiot!

471
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:15,775
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

472
00:27:28,377 --> 00:27:30,584
Hurry up.
Get in the circle, get in the circle.

473
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:32,795
Come on, come on. Quick, quick.

474
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:36,750
Guys, guys, I don't wanna die, okay?
And I don't want you...

475
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:39,088
- Hey, listen to me, okay?
- Don't want you to...

476
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:41,839
Listen, if we don't die...

477
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,476
...it's totally okay if you, uh,
do my sister.

478
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:48,476
- Ow!
Nice.

479
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:50,560
Guys. Hey, guys.

480
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,185
It's coming again.

481
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:55,567
Okay. Oh, God. Get in close.
- Why does this keep happening?

482
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,782
Why does this keep happening?

483
00:27:58,371 --> 00:28:00,198
Oh, my God.

484
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:04,330
Oh, God.

485
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:06,128
Oh, God.

486
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:12,292
Corbett.

487
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,961
Hey, can I ask you something?

488
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,596
- What?
- Earlier, you and Sam.

489
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:19,595
He said you had two months left?

490
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,348
It's complicated.

491
00:28:21,522 --> 00:28:23,515
A while ago, Sam...

492
00:28:25,277 --> 00:28:28,278
<i>No, no, no. I'm not gonna whine
about my * * * * * * * * problems...</i>

493
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:30,986
<i>...to some * * * * * * * * reality show.</i>

494
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:33,697
<i>I'm gonna do my * * * * * * * job.</i>

495
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,239
Is it cancer?
- Shut up.

496
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:42,580
You hear that?

497
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,587
I've been waiting
for some more friends.

498
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,383
I get lonely.

499
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:49,592
But you're coming to my party,
aren't you?

500
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:53,263
Is that music?
It's coming from behind this wall.

501
00:29:05,365 --> 00:29:07,322
Wow, you're strong.

502
00:29:07,492 --> 00:29:10,529
You'll stay a good, long time.

503
00:29:16,837 --> 00:29:18,379
Sam!

504
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,507
Oh, my God.

505
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,949
Oh, no. Corbett.

506
00:29:50,376 --> 00:29:52,084
Oh, God, what have we done?

507
00:29:52,253 --> 00:29:53,712
- Oh, Corbett.
- Ed. Ed.

508
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:57,499
Yeah?
- Corbett's... He's a death echo.

509
00:29:57,676 --> 00:30:00,001
He's, uh, reliving his own murder.

510
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:03,097
Over and over forever.

511
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:09,315
What's this Daggett guy's
problem anyway?

512
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:10,596
Loneliness.

513
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:12,601
- Has he never heard of a RealDoll?
- No, no.

514
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:16,063
Daggett was the Norman Bates,
stuff-your-mother kind of lonely.

515
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:19,157
I mean, that's why he
lifted these bodies from the morgue.

516
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:23,241
He threw himself a birthday party, except
they were the only ones who would come.

517
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:27,247
Anyway, so at midnight, he sealed them
in the bomb shelter and went upstairs...

518
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:28,961
...and OD'd on horse tranqs.

519
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,458
How do you know this?

520
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:32,873
- Because he told me.
- Oh.

521
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,257
- Yeah.
- Okay, so now that he's dead, what?

522
00:30:35,428 --> 00:30:38,631
Same song, different verse,
trying to get people come to his party?

523
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:41,133
Pretty much, yeah. Stay forever.

524
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,303
Those real bullets?

525
00:30:43,521 --> 00:30:44,766
It's rock salt.

526
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,858
<i>Ghostfacers</i>

527
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:52,028
<i>We go to places where others will not</i>

528
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:53,823
<i>Ghostfacers</i>

529
00:30:53,992 --> 00:30:58,072

530
00:30:58,246 --> 00:30:59,871
Guys.

531
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:03,873
Oh, no.
Oh, Corbett.

532
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,959
Wait, guys.

533
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,885
Guys, it's... It's Corbett.

534
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:14,628
He's... He's trapped.

535
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:18,306
He's in a lot of pain, you know?
We gotta... We gotta try and...

536
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:21,100
We got to try
and pull him out of his loop.

537
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:25,317
We have to.

538
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,192
Ed.

539
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:30,108
Corbett?

540
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:33,159
Corbett, it's...

541
00:31:33,662 --> 00:31:36,948
- Oh, God. I gotta do it, Harry.
Don't cross the line of salt.

542
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:40,208
Corbett, listen to me.

543
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:42,205
Okay, I'm not gonna hurt you.

544
00:31:42,381 --> 00:31:44,005
Listen.

545
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:46,419
Listen. Oh, God.

546
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:47,969
Corbett.

547
00:31:48,554 --> 00:31:50,843
- Oh, my God.
Get back here. Get back.

548
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:53,175
I can't, okay?

549
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:57,766
He's not hearing me, okay?
He won't stop dying.

550
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:04,569
Seriously? You're still shooting?

551
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,611
It makes him feel better. Don't ask.

552
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:11,698
God.

553
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:15,324
Oh, hell, guys.
Get in your ghost role thing.

554
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:16,997
Something's coming.

555
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:20,007
Oh, my God. Aah!

556
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,638
L... I know how
we can get through to him.

557
00:32:31,813 --> 00:32:32,844
How?

558
00:32:33,023 --> 00:32:34,517
Ed.

559
00:32:36,193 --> 00:32:39,195
- He had feelings for you.
- Huh?

560
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:43,195
- He wanted you.
- Wha...?

561
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,779
- Wanted me to what?
- You know.

562
00:32:44,953 --> 00:32:46,448
No.

563
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:50,867
And you know what you've gotta do.

564
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:54,169
You can do it, Ed.

565
00:32:54,547 --> 00:32:57,715
You've always been the brave one.
Yes, you can. You make us brave.

566
00:32:57,885 --> 00:32:59,677
- Maggie, right? Yeah.
Yeah, you do.

567
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:01,008
You totally do.

568
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,806
Ed...

569
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:05,930
...you gotta go be gay
for that poor, dead intern.

570
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:08,641
You gotta send him into the light.

571
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:27,908
Corbett.

572
00:33:28,629 --> 00:33:32,164
Maggie. No, no, Maggie.
No, it's okay. Don't worry.

573
00:33:32,341 --> 00:33:33,456
Corbett, look.

574
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:35,046
Hey, it's just Ed, buddy.

575
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,631
It's just me.

576
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:38,798
Hey. Hey, Corbett, listen to me.

577
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:42,059
Listen to me. I'm... We...

578
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,017
Okay.

579
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,852
You meant...

580
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:51,726
Corbett, you meant a lot to the team.

581
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,117
You meant...

582
00:33:57,663 --> 00:33:59,121
You meant a lot to me.

583
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,327
You know, never ever back down...

584
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:07,047
...never say a bad word, okay?
I remember that, Corbett. L...

585
00:34:07,508 --> 00:34:11,173
I remember that.
I remember because I love you, Corbett.

586
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:14,757
I really, truly love you.

587
00:34:17,853 --> 00:34:18,932
Do you remember that?

588
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:20,729
Do you?

589
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,607
- Hey. Ed?
Yeah.

590
00:34:25,653 --> 00:34:27,611
Yeah, Corbett, it's...

591
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:31,614
Corbett, yeah, it's me.

592
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:34,788
It's me. Look at me.

593
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,952
You gotta help us, man.

594
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:41,330
You have to help us, Corbett.
Please. Please.

595
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:44,175
Please help us right now.

596
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:45,966
Take it easy. You all right?

597
00:34:46,136 --> 00:34:48,709
Uh, guys.

598
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:52,265
Hey! Come here!

599
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:55,305
This is bad. Very bad.

600
00:35:02,196 --> 00:35:03,987
Corbett?

601
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:16,291
You all right, dude?
- Oh. Unh.

602
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:19,333
You all right?
- Oh.

603
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:26,882
Oh, my God.

604
00:35:45,497 --> 00:35:50,160
<i>Leap year, February 29th,
the Morton House.</i>

605
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:51,996
<i>A tragic day.</i>

606
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:55,375
<i>A day of souls bound in torment...</i>

607
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:59,549
<i>...of lives held in cruel balance.</i>

608
00:35:59,722 --> 00:36:03,388
<i>But the Ghostfacers,
they did the best that they could.</i>

609
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,344
<i>We lost a beloved friend...</i>

610
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:10,608
<i>...but we gained new allies.</i>

611
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:12,686
<i>We know this much:</i>

612
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:18,202
<i>That every day, including today,
is a new beginning.</i>

613
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:24,161
We learned more than we can say
in the brutal feat of the Morton House.

614
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:31,631
The Ghostfacers were forced to face
something far more scary than ghosts.

615
00:36:32,593 --> 00:36:34,467
They were forced to face themselves.

616
00:36:36,223 --> 00:36:37,931
War changes man.

617
00:36:38,976 --> 00:36:40,553
And Maggie.

618
00:36:41,812 --> 00:36:45,312
War changes man...

619
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:46,514
...and one woman.

620
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:51,897
You know, Corbett, we just...

621
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:56,734
Oh, gosh, we just like to think
that you're out there watching over us.

622
00:36:56,913 --> 00:37:01,207
As far as we're concerned,
you're not an intern anymore.

623
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:05,541
You have more than earned
full Ghostfacer status.

624
00:37:05,715 --> 00:37:07,754
Plus it'd cool
to have a ghost on the team.

625
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:08,958
Yeah.

626
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:13,465
And here we were thinking that,
you know, we were teaching you...

627
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,595
...and all this time,
you were teaching us...

628
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:19,683
...about heart...

629
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:22,271
...about dedication.

630
00:37:23,986 --> 00:37:25,646
About...

631
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:31,861
...how gay love can pierce through
the veil of death and save the day.

632
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:35,578
Thank you, Alan J. Corbett.

633
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:40,201
Go well into that starry night,
young Turk.

634
00:37:42,257 --> 00:37:43,835
Go well.

635
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:54,430
Come on, Spruce,
I gotta get all this stuff packed up.

636
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,479
So? Pack and talk.

637
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,894
I don't know what to say.

638
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,859
Say what comes to mind.

639
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,563
This is one of our confessional moments,
Corbett, so confess.

640
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,733
What'd you think
was gonna happen tonight?

641
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,160
What do you think's
gonna happen tonight on this trip?

642
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,783
I think tonight...

643
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,157
I really do.

644
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:15,873
- I think all our dreams
are gonna come true.

645
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:19,376
Does that sound stupid?

646
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:21,674
Kind of does, yeah.
- Ha, ha.

647
00:38:43,578 --> 00:38:46,035
So guys, what do you think?

648
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,535
You all right?

649
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:50,868
You know, I kind of think
it was half awesome.

650
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:54,497
Half awesome.
That's full-on good, right?

651
00:38:54,675 --> 00:38:57,213
Yeah. I mean,
it's bizarre how y'all are able to, uh...

652
00:38:57,386 --> 00:39:01,467
...honor Corbett's memory while grossly
exploiting the manner of his death.

653
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:04,678
Yeah. No, it's a real tight rope
you guys are walking.

654
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:07,226
Yeah. All right, guys.

655
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:10,563
No, that's reality, man.

656
00:39:10,734 --> 00:39:13,309
Yeah. Corbett gave his life
searching for the truth...

657
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:17,106
...and it is our job over here
to share it with the world.

658
00:39:17,284 --> 00:39:19,692
Right. Well, um, our experience:

659
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:21,863
Know what you get
when you show the truth?

660
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,866
A straitjacket or a punch in the face.

661
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,537
- Sometimes both.
- Right.

662
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:27,668
Come on, guys,
don't be Facer haters because...

663
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:30,840
...we happened to have gotten
the footage of the century.

664
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:32,468
Oh, yeah.

665
00:39:34,888 --> 00:39:36,086
- You got us there.
- Yeah.

666
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:39,052
Yeah. Well, we'll see you guys around.

667
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:42,599
- Yeah.
- Peace out.

668
00:39:49,404 --> 00:39:51,943
- Dicks.
- Oh, yeah.

669
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:54,821
Totally.
- Yep. Let's start laying off some DVDs.

670
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:57,202
That sounds like a good idea, Spruce.

671
00:39:57,373 --> 00:39:59,579
I think we're gonna
need a bigger office here.

672
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,583
Because we're gonna go national,
then it's gonna go international, and...

673
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:07,373
- Menudo left their dance bag behind.
- Ha-ha-ha.

674
00:40:07,551 --> 00:40:08,961
What's inside?

675
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:10,714
Huh?

676
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:14,843
Whoa. What the hell is this?

677
00:40:15,017 --> 00:40:18,968
Uh, seem to be having
some technical difficulty over here.

678
00:40:19,606 --> 00:40:22,144
- Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

679
00:40:22,317 --> 00:40:25,236
Wait! " No operating system
found"? Wait a minute.

680
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:29,527
- We clean?
No!

681
00:40:29,702 --> 00:40:32,109
Are you kidding me?
No. This can't be happening.

682
00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:35,705
Harry. Harry. No!

683
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:38,415
Electromagnet.
Wiped out every tape and hard drive.

684
00:40:38,587 --> 00:40:40,414
World just isn't ready
for the Ghostfacers.

685
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:42,879
That's too bad,
I kind of liked the show.

686
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:46,921
Had its moments.

687
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:12,456
