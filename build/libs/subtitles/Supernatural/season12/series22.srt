1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:01,132
Hands were I can see 'em.

2
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:03,133
Is that you, Roy?
Which makes you Walt.

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,340
Jody Mills is good people,

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,909
and she'll give you
a place to crash

5
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:11,443
until you get back on your feet.

6
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,512
If only you'd been
as ruthless as I hoped.

7
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,148
- Now what?
- Let's begin.

8
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,482
I do have to hand it
to Lady Bevell.

9
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,051
Your treatment's been
most successful.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,160
Stay where you are.
Hey!

11
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:30,595
I was talking to you.
Mom?

12
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:34,065
I really wouldn't move.
She <i>will</i> shoot you.

13
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,034
- Where do you think you're going?
- Ketch.

14
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,904
Your bunker is
an excellent fortress.

15
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,872
An even better tomb.

16
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,241
We've rejiggered the locks,
we've shut off the water,

17
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,676
and once we leave,

18
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,245
the pumps that bring in the air
shall reverse.

19
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,815
Your oxygen
should be gone in...

20
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,350
two days, maybe three.

21
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,985
Come along, Mary.

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,756
No!

23
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,605
?

24
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:35,493
?

25
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,892
?

26
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:10,894

28
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,802
All right. The garage?

29
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,739
Doors are warded and the walls
are reinforced steel.

30
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,041
Okay. Um, you know, maybe we could
get out through the air vents.

31
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,210
You wouldn't get far.

32
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,778
There are choke points
in the duct system

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,446
not even I could
squeeze through.

34
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,948
I say we kill her.

35
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,383
I mean, you heard Ketch.

36
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,485
Said we had about
three days of air left.

37
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,920
So if we ice her, maybe that
buys us an extra day.

38
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,288
I assure you, Dean,

39
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,324
I'm an extraordinarily
shallow breather.

40
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,227
Hmm. All right.
<i>If</i> we ever get out of here,

41
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,295
I am the one who programmed
your mother,

42
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,931
which means that I am
the only one who can undo it.

43
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,735
And since I assume
you want Mummy back,

44
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,137
you need me.

45
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,542
You believe her?
I don't know.

46
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,010
Look, if she's lying,
sure, we take her out.

47
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,879
But Mom is still out there,
brainwashed.

48
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,148
If she's telling the truth,
then we do need her.

49
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,352
All right, you're so smart,
how do we get out of here?

50
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,354
The only way out is to pull
the manual override.

51
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,423
Is that a thing?
Oh, it is.

52
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,426
But it's outside the bunker,
where we can't reach it.

53
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,628
Awesome.

54
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,430
Wait a second, guys.

55
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,265
We're in a giant vault

56
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,134
loaded down with --
with occult books and lore.

57
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,669
There's gotta be something
somewhere in here --

58
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,071
an item or a spell --

59
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,873
some hoodoo that can reverse
the lockdown.

60
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,716
I think I got something.

61
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,685
“When the Romani people were
forced to assimilate in Europe,

62
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,720
“the, uh, the Roma used a spell,

63
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,823
“the Abrogation ritual,
as an act of rebellion

64
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,424
“against their persecutors.

65
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:50,095
“The Devla turns back
complex mechanical processes,

66
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,197
resets equipment, machinery.”

67
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,165
What's it take?
Seems like pretty basic ingredients.

68
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,301
Nothing we don't already have.

69
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,403
Oh.
What?

70
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,906
The mechanisms “must be anointed
with the blood of virgins.”

71
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,746
Not even close.

72
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,915
All right, well, then,
I guess we keep lookin'.

73
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,151
Or we fake it.
Excuse me?

74
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,719
We fake it.

75
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,855
I mean, I've read half a dozen
purification rituals

76
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,389
in the last hour.

77
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,792
If we used one of those on --
on our blood...

78
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,161
Then what? Revirginize it?

79
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,629
Maybe.

80
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,198
So we purify the blood,
then do the spell.

81
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,368
Two-step, hybrid magic.

82
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,549
All right, that's step one.

83
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,284
Step two, you're up.

84
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,886
<i>F?rmichi, f?rmichi,</i>

85
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,889
<i>mashuna parra, mashuna parra.</i>

86
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,398
It's working.

87
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,167
It's working!

88
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,480
No.

89
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,882
<i>No.</i>
What happened?

90
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,718
Ketch! He knew we'd...

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,820
He must've put some kind
of mystical dampener

92
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,089
on the bunker's lockdown.

93
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,791
Magic won't work.

94
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,433
Okay, we have...
exhausted brains,

95
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,468
so I saw we try brawn.

96
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,537
How?
Walls.

97
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,139
Now the garage,
the Crow's Nest,

98
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,308
these are all
reinforced steel walls, right?

99
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,044
But right here,
that's nothing but concrete.

100
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,946
And right there,
that's an old sewer pipe,

101
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:51,182
goes straight up to
the surface...to the override.

102
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,585
So wait a second.
We're just gonna...

103
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,053
Straight Shawshank
this bitch.

104
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:58,289
?

105
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,462
Goggles?
Goggles.

106
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,213
Yeah.

107
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,953
Oh, yeah.

108
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,124
We earned a break.

109
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,360
Yeah.

110
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,662
We'll get there.

111
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,833
No.

112
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,202
No, we won't.

113
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,878
We're not gonna hit dirt
for three days.

114
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,680
Two if we're lucky.

115
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,352
I know you feel it --
the air, it's thin.

116
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,490
And it's getting thinner.

117
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,396
How did this happen?

118
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,500
What part?

119
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,703
All of it.

120
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,973
Yeah.

121
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,243
You know, it wasn't long ago,
I thought we had it made.

122
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,545
We saved the world.

123
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:31,582
We got Cass back.
We had Mom back.

124
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:37,889
I mean, it wasn't perfect,
but still, we had 'em.

125
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,357
And now...

126
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,592
Now they're all gone.

127
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:47,632
And Mom,
what they did to her...

128
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,072
I just fell
for their company line.

129
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,473
Man, I...

130
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,978
I saw what they were doing,
and I -- and I thought,

131
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,083
Hunters on that scale,
working together...

132
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,719
how much good we can do.

133
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,092
And once I was in, I...

134
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,162
I just followed.

135
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,101
'Cause it was easy.

136
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,969
Easier.

137
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,838
Easier than what?

138
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,274
Easier than leading.

139
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,652
Is this how you pictured it?
The end?

140
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,325
Oh, you know it's not.

141
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,295
I always thought
we'd go out like...

142
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,564
Butch and Sundance style.

143
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,266
Yeah.

144
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,970
Blaze of glory.
Blaze of glory.

145
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:02,206
?

146
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,478
Son of a bitch.

147
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,846
Hmm.

148
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,815
You're lunatics.

149
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:14,285
This is
a colossally stupid idea.

150
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,320
Yep.

151
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,190
Big, beautiful,

152
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,591
and dumb.

153
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,059
I've had this thing
for so long.

154
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,861
Been waiting for
the perfect moment to use it.

155
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,396
The explosion could kill us all.

156
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,398
You could bring the whole bloody
place crashing down.

157
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,866
Yeah.
Yeah.

158
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,601
You're lunatics.

159
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,504
Action movie-loving,
cheeseburger-eating,

160
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,008
moronic American lunatics.

161
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,878
Okay, beautiful.

162
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,748
Yippee ki-yay, mother --

163
00:09:54,638 --> 00:09:56,305
Dean?

164
00:09:58,175 --> 00:09:59,842
Dean!

165
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,559
?

166
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:23,232
Dean?

167
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:59,301
?

168
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:09,945
Hey, lunatic.

169
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:16,618
?

170
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:26,728
Mary?
Hey, Jody.

171
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,499
Uh...
You got a sec?

172
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:35,070
Yeah.

173
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:38,674
Dead.

174
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:40,776
Uh, dead.

175
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:46,648
Wait, I got one.

176
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:50,252
Garth? Hey.

177
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:52,221
Oh, man. It's good
to hear your voice.

178
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:54,890
Listen, uh, those Brits
I told you about,

179
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:57,125
they've got a hit out
on American Hunters.

180
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:59,928
I'm guessing that goes double
for werewolf hunters, so...

181
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,396
No, I don't have time
to explain.

182
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:03,465
You and Bess need to get
someplace safe.

183
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:06,268
Okay? All right.

184
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,003
Hey.

185
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,705
Jody.

186
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,610
?

187
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:19,982
Jody?

188
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:24,786
Jody. Alex.

189
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:27,656
Hey.
Hey. Where is she?

190
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:36,265
Hello, boys.

191
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:38,967
When she clocked me out of the
blue, I thought she was a demon.

192
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:41,870
I had no idea that brainwashing
could be so thorough.

193
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:44,139
Jody, she...

194
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:45,941
I'm so sorry.

195
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:47,643
It's not your fault.

196
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,177
Fortunately, Alex came home.

197
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:52,648
All I did was buy you time.
You knocked her out.

198
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:58,854
I'll get you something
for the pain.

199
00:12:58,856 --> 00:13:00,889
Make it a double.

200
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:08,630
Aw.

201
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:11,500
You wanna play mother
to my son?

202
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:13,368
He's all yours.

203
00:13:14,638 --> 00:13:17,072
Dean...

204
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:18,640
that's not your mom.

205
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:20,075
What's the matter, Dean?

206
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:22,210
Am I too different from
the Mary you know?

207
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:28,317
Or too much the same?

208
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:31,086
Here she is.

209
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:32,654
Do your thing.

210
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:35,924
All right, you said you could
fix her, so fix her.

211
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:37,559
I, um...

212
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:39,394
Well, I --
She lied.

213
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:42,030
What?

214
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:44,066
Mary's programming...

215
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:45,901
It's permanent.

216
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:47,903
But you said...

217
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:50,238
You were going to kill me.

218
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:54,443
The Mary that you know,
the good Mary,

219
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:58,880
she's hiding behind
impenetrable psychic walls.

220
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:01,750
And I'm afraid these walls...

221
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:07,656
Well, they can't be torn down
with grenades.

222
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,760
Your mother can't be saved.

223
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:14,997
?

224
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:20,669
All right, “Lady,” time's up.

225
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,671
We only kept you alive
for one reason.

226
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:24,406
Hey, guys.

227
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:27,442
Listen, uh, Ketch keeps callin'
Mom's phone.

228
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:29,745
I'll get it.

229
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:31,279
Let it go to voicemail.

230
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,317
Let's take a nice little
short walk to the backyard.

231
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:37,652
This is not going to stop.

232
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:41,990
Soon enough, they'll find out
you're alive, and then...

233
00:14:41,992 --> 00:14:45,093
Well, if you want
my advice -- run.

234
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:46,495
We're not running.

235
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:49,564
Well, then, you die.

236
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:51,666
Or...

237
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:53,135
Or what?

238
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:55,837
Or we fight.

239
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:01,543
Feet off the table, Jerry.

240
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:03,612
Thanks.

241
00:15:04,982 --> 00:15:06,782
That should be the last one.

242
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:16,391
Walt. Roy.

243
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:19,428
Well, damn.

244
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,196
We haven't
seen you guys since --

245
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,232
Since you killed us.
No hard feelings.

246
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:28,804
Uh, uh, please,
get comfortable.

247
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,406
Sure about this?

248
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:36,678
You gonna tell us what
we're doing here or what?

249
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,580
Ah.
Of course. Yeah.

250
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:42,184
Um, so my -- my brother and I,
we -- we, um...

251
00:15:46,323 --> 00:15:49,724
No, you know what?

252
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:53,328
<i>I</i> called you here
because people...

253
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:59,034
um, our people,
are being slaughtered.

254
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,902
And we're next.

255
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,339
The British Men of Letters,

256
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:05,874
they came here because they
thought they could do our job

257
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:07,609
better than we could.

258
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:10,145
And they hooked us with their
flashy gear and their tech.

259
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:12,681
Most of you had the good sense
to turn 'em down.

260
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:15,083
I didn't.

261
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:21,523
They said they wanted the same
thing we wanted, you know?

262
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:23,058
A world free of monsters.

263
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,961
That's not what
they really wanted.

264
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:28,263
They want control.

265
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:29,664
They want to live in a world

266
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,433
where they can sit
in some office

267
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:33,435
and decide who gets to live
and who gets to die.

268
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:34,870
And they've killed people.

269
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:36,605
They've killed innocent people

270
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,207
just because they got
in the way.

271
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:41,877
They think the ends justify
the means.

272
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,212
But we know better.

273
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:47,115
We know hunting isn't just
about killing.

274
00:16:47,117 --> 00:16:51,353
It's about doing what's right,
even when it's hard.

275
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,188
So we go by our gut, right?

276
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,358
We play by our own rules,
and that scares them.

277
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,826
That's why they want us dead,

278
00:16:57,828 --> 00:16:59,694
'cause we're the one thing
they can't control.

279
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:01,429
So what do you want
from us?

280
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,568
I want you to follow me.

281
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,970
Take the fight to them.

282
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:11,339
To hit them before they hit us.

283
00:17:11,341 --> 00:17:14,943
We go in fast and hard
and we fight

284
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:18,613
and we beat them down
until they give up

285
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:20,882
or until they're dead.

286
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:23,084
?

287
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:25,554
Look, they're well-trained
and well-armed.

288
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:28,156
Some of us might not
make it back.

289
00:17:28,158 --> 00:17:29,624
But we will win.

290
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:32,460
We will take down the bad guys

291
00:17:32,462 --> 00:17:36,198
because that's what we do.

292
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:42,637
They're scared of us.
Yeah. Good.

293
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:45,040
They should be.

294
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,881
?

295
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,697
You know where
we're goin'?

296
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,366
- Yep.
-Gear up. We roll out in 10.

297
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,801
You ready?
Ooh.

298
00:17:59,803 --> 00:18:02,203
Oh, no. I'm not goin'.
What?

299
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:05,106
No, my leg busted up the way
it is, I'm no good in a fight.

300
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:07,042
I-I'll take
a jacked up Dean Winchester

301
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,145
over any 10 other Hunters
any day.

302
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:12,447
Yeah.

303
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:14,349
I saw you.

304
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,017
You're ready for this.

305
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:19,521
You show those sons of bitches
who's boss.

306
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,526
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

307
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:27,996
I'm gonna save Mom.

308
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:33,902
Look, if she's in there,

309
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,772
if our real Mom
is in there somewhere,

310
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:40,875
then I'm gonna try and find her,
bring her back.

311
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:47,048
Okay, Donna's --
Waiting for me at a safe house.

312
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,483
I should drive straight there,
no stops.

313
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:50,552
And you'll call me
when this is all over.

314
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:52,554
I got it.

315
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:55,490
And, Jody --
I'll be careful. I promise.

316
00:18:55,492 --> 00:18:58,126
Not what I was gonna ask.

317
00:18:58,128 --> 00:19:00,495
Kick it in the ass.

318
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:09,237
You got this.

319
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:13,675
Come here.

320
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,412
You come back.

321
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:19,147
Promise.

322
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:20,648
Bitch.

323
00:19:22,352 --> 00:19:24,719
Jerk.
Yeah.

324
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:30,758
?

325
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:36,164
Okay, you got inside
my Mom's head once before.

326
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,233
What about me? You get me in?

327
00:19:38,235 --> 00:19:40,535
You? I...

328
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:42,937
Perhaps.

329
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:44,539
But I need my rig.

330
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,941
Where is it?
At the base.

331
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:50,912
But I suppose with
the right materials,

332
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:54,215
I could cobble something
together.

333
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:58,786
Target lists will be
distributed shortly.

334
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:01,089
In Phase Two,

335
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:03,358
there are no restrictions.

336
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,427
Family members, bystanders.

337
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:09,264
Don't...leave...witnesses.

338
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,167
That will be all.

339
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,073
?

340
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,581
Paige, I need you
to pull up

341
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,383
the location
of one of our assets,

342
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:30,785
and I need you to keep it
between us.

343
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:33,621
Who?
Mary Winchester.

344
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:37,458
She's in...

345
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:47,402
Lebanon, Kansas.

346
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:51,306
?

347
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:56,211
All right,
where's the stuff you need?

348
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,580
Should be in storage,
next to the dungeon.

349
00:20:58,582 --> 00:21:00,014
Ah.

350
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:02,116
Think I'm lettin' you
out of my sight?

351
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:05,720
Need I remind you that
my organization left me to die?

352
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,057
At this point, I'm not
on anyone's side but my own.

353
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,361
So I help you try to save
your mother,

354
00:21:13,363 --> 00:21:16,164
and when the dust clears...

355
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,966
What? I let you go?

356
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:21,369
I'd like
to see my son again.

357
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:25,540
I'm not asking for a pass.

358
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:28,509
I'm asking for a head start.

359
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:36,517
?

360
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,496
?

361
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:57,672
These electrodes sync
your Delta waves with Mary's

362
00:21:57,674 --> 00:21:59,607
forming a psychic link.

363
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,277
But to enter her psyche
will take a certain measure

364
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,313
of concentration and skill.

365
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:07,015
And as there's no time
to teach you how to reach

366
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:09,684
the necessary
therapeutic dreamstate,

367
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:13,254
I'm banking on this.

368
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:17,759
Hypnotic agents laced with
a potent sedative.

369
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:22,864
Ah.

370
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:26,534
It's enough to knock an elephant
on its trunk.

371
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,809
Really?

372
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,945
Little insurance.
You understand.

373
00:22:37,947 --> 00:22:39,547
This will hurt.

374
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:42,150
You understand.

375
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:57,965
?

376
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:17,752
?

377
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:17,645
Sam.

378
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,720
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

379
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:36,330
?

380
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:39,367
Dean, lunch is ready.

381
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:50,344
Mom.

382
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:52,947
We gotta get out of here, okay?

383
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,249
You need to come with me.

384
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:57,885
Mom?

385
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:00,254
Mom.

386
00:25:01,825 --> 00:25:04,392
Mom.

387
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:15,052
?

388
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,859
Uhh!

389
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,205
What is happening
out there?

390
00:25:35,207 --> 00:25:36,707
Perimeter's breached.

391
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,145
Hunters.

392
00:25:41,147 --> 00:25:43,781
Gentlemen, ladies,

393
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:46,083
you know what to do.

394
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,154
Get down!

395
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:02,566
Look, I know that they
messed with your head, okay?

396
00:26:02,568 --> 00:26:05,836
I know it feels better in here.

397
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:07,504
It feels safer.

398
00:26:07,506 --> 00:26:09,573
But I-I need you
to hear me.

399
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:14,111
I was thinking maybe we should
take Sammy to the park later,

400
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:15,612
before Daddy gets home.

401
00:26:15,614 --> 00:26:17,181
Sound good?

402
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:19,883
Mom, look at me.

403
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,359
You're choosing this.

404
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:30,928
Your favorite.

405
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,596
Yes!

406
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:34,465
After you eat.

407
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:41,105
?

408
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:44,441
I only want good things
for you, Dean.

409
00:26:44,443 --> 00:26:47,945
I'll never let anything bad
happen to you.

410
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:55,486
I hate you.

411
00:26:57,823 --> 00:27:01,525
?

412
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:22,613
Go, go, go, go, go.

413
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,649
Go! Hurry! Hurry!

414
00:27:51,977 --> 00:27:55,212
?

415
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,121
Uhh!

416
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,857
You lied to me.

417
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:10,260
I was a kid.

418
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:16,533
You promised
you'd keep me safe.

419
00:28:18,003 --> 00:28:21,405
And then you make a deal
with Azazel.

420
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:24,041
Yeah, it saved Dad's life,

421
00:28:24,043 --> 00:28:26,310
but I'll tell you
something else that happened.

422
00:28:26,312 --> 00:28:29,680
Because on November 2, 1983,

423
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:34,952
old Yellow Eyes came
waltzing in to Sammy's room

424
00:28:34,954 --> 00:28:36,386
because of your deal.

425
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:46,230
You left us.

426
00:28:49,034 --> 00:28:52,202
Alone.

427
00:28:52,204 --> 00:28:54,304
'Cause Dad was just a shell.

428
00:28:55,674 --> 00:28:59,409
His perfect wife? Gone.

429
00:28:59,411 --> 00:29:03,013
Our perfect Mom,
the perfect family...

430
00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:06,216
was gone.

431
00:29:06,218 --> 00:29:07,951
And I...

432
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:13,090
I had to be...

433
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:14,525
more than just a brother.

434
00:29:14,527 --> 00:29:19,596
I had to be a father
and I had to be a mother,

435
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:22,266
to keep him safe.

436
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:26,036
And that wasn't fair.

437
00:29:27,673 --> 00:29:29,806
And I couldn't do it.

438
00:29:31,744 --> 00:29:34,044
And you wanna know what
that was like?

439
00:29:38,684 --> 00:29:41,385
They killed the girl
that he loved.

440
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:46,790
He got possessed
by Lucifer.

441
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:51,862
They tortured him in Hell.

442
00:29:53,832 --> 00:29:55,699
And he lost his soul.

443
00:29:57,436 --> 00:29:58,902
His soul.

444
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:04,841
All because of you.

445
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:09,279
?

446
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:12,683
All of it
was because of you.

447
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:32,669
I hate you.

448
00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:39,743
I hate you.

449
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,848
And I love you.

450
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:57,728
'Cause I can't --
I can't help it.

451
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:03,367
You're my Mom.

452
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:10,607
And I understand...

453
00:31:12,177 --> 00:31:15,779
...'cause I have made deals
to save the ones I love

454
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:18,448
more than once.

455
00:31:19,418 --> 00:31:22,119
I forgive you.

456
00:31:27,926 --> 00:31:29,793
I forgive you.

457
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:34,264
For all of it.

458
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,669
Everything.

459
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,641
On the other side of this,

460
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:47,744
we can start over, okay?

461
00:31:47,746 --> 00:31:51,848
You, me, Sam.

462
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:56,687
We can get it right this time.
But I need you to fight.

463
00:31:56,689 --> 00:31:58,422
Right now,
I need you to fight.

464
00:31:58,424 --> 00:32:01,491
I need you -- I need you
to look at me, Mom.

465
00:32:01,493 --> 00:32:04,594
I need you to really look
at me and see me.

466
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,967
Mom, I need you to see me.

467
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:16,440
Please.

468
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:29,519
?

469
00:32:32,324 --> 00:32:34,458
Dean?

470
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,227
Mom.

471
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:54,745
No.
Oh, yes.

472
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,654
?

473
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:19,669
Aah!

474
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:21,972
Oh, what? Thought you'd get
your Mum back?

475
00:33:21,974 --> 00:33:24,040
Sorry, Dean.
Not how this ends.

476
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:27,744
This ends with me ending you.

477
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:32,749
I'm gonna kill you.
You won't,

478
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:35,952
but I'd very much enjoy it
if you tried.

479
00:33:44,296 --> 00:33:47,531
?

480
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:52,502
You want to know what your
mother said about you, Dean?

481
00:33:52,504 --> 00:33:57,140
All those long days
and even longer nights

482
00:33:57,142 --> 00:33:59,910
out on the road, hunting?

483
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,446
Hmm?

484
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:04,714
Absolutely nothing.

485
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:11,388
Ah. This is fun.

486
00:34:17,563 --> 00:34:20,797
?

487
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:26,603
Hey!

488
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:30,574
I got this.
Yeah.

489
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,414
Ah!

490
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:58,068
When you left us alone
in the bunker,

491
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,003
man, I knew
you were psycho,

492
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:02,305
but I didn't think
you were stupid.

493
00:35:02,307 --> 00:35:05,609
I may be many things...

494
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:09,412
...but I'm not stupid.

495
00:35:09,414 --> 00:35:12,649
?

496
00:35:30,135 --> 00:35:32,536
Mom?
Mary.

497
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:41,545
Ah.

498
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:51,187
I...

499
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:55,759
I knew you were a killer.

500
00:35:57,896 --> 00:36:00,830
You both are.

501
00:36:00,832 --> 00:36:03,767
You're right.

502
00:36:14,246 --> 00:36:16,112
Whatever it takes --
open a portal.

503
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:19,282
Just get me the hell
out of here.

504
00:36:19,284 --> 00:36:21,384
<i>I'm afraid we don't have</i>
<i>the resources</i>

505
00:36:21,386 --> 00:36:24,688
<i>for an extraction</i>
<i>at this moment.</i>

506
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,392
Don't! Don't.

507
00:36:29,394 --> 00:36:33,096
?

508
00:36:33,098 --> 00:36:34,998
Listen, Dean --

509
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,299
It's Sam.

510
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:39,169
And you must be Hess,
I trust.

511
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:41,371
You're in charge
of this whole operation?

512
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:44,274
Or, uh,
what's left of it?

513
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:48,612
Sam, you might think it in
your best interest to kill me,

514
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:50,614
to end all of this here.

515
00:36:50,616 --> 00:36:52,015
Mm.

516
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:53,516
But shooting me now,

517
00:36:53,518 --> 00:36:55,785
severing all ties with
the British Men of Letters,

518
00:36:55,787 --> 00:36:57,420
at this particular moment,

519
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:59,556
that would be
a grievous mistake.

520
00:36:59,558 --> 00:37:00,924
I doubt it.

521
00:37:00,926 --> 00:37:04,094
There are reasons
to reconsider.

522
00:37:06,164 --> 00:37:08,732
Things that you don't know.

523
00:37:23,715 --> 00:37:25,048
What are these?

524
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,850
Lucifer is back.

525
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:32,255
Yes, Sam. All thanks
to your good friend Crowley.

526
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:35,191
Not that it did him
much good.

527
00:37:35,193 --> 00:37:37,594
Crowley's dead.

528
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:41,665
And the Devil

529
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,600
is out looking for his son,

530
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:45,368
following in
its mother's footsteps,

531
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:49,606
tracking her
and your friend the angel.

532
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:55,478
If Lucifer gets his hands
on that child,

533
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,415
they'll be unstoppable.

534
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:02,018
You can't face that alone.
You need us.

535
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:04,988
<i>Listen to her, boy.</i>

536
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:18,001
?

537
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:22,806
Pass.

538
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:30,046
You bastard.

539
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:43,393
?

540
00:39:04,183 --> 00:39:07,131
Found some expired
prescription painkillers,

541
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:11,167
so...
lucky me.

542
00:39:11,169 --> 00:39:14,937
Mom, you don't have to do that.
It's not your job.

543
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:17,373
This...

544
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:21,177
All of this
is because of me.

545
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:25,815
It'll be okay.

546
00:39:25,817 --> 00:39:28,584
It's not okay.

547
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:39,328
Since I've been back,

548
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:44,400
I know...
I've been distant.

549
00:39:44,402 --> 00:39:46,335
Cold, even.

550
00:39:49,074 --> 00:39:51,340
Leaving you,

551
00:39:51,342 --> 00:39:54,043
working with them...

552
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,514
I was trying
to make things right.

553
00:40:00,652 --> 00:40:03,719
Just from a distance,
because...

554
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:07,857
being here with you

555
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:10,526
was too hard.

556
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:14,097
Seeing what I'd done

557
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:18,167
to you and to Sam, I...

558
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:21,104
Mom, what you did,

559
00:40:21,106 --> 00:40:22,738
the deal...

560
00:40:24,776 --> 00:40:28,244
...everything
that's happened since

561
00:40:28,246 --> 00:40:30,780
has made us who we are.

562
00:40:30,782 --> 00:40:34,016
And who we are?

563
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:37,487
We kick ass.

564
00:40:38,723 --> 00:40:41,390
We save the world.

565
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:47,497
And Sam?

566
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:51,434
I'm scared. What...

567
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:55,805
What if he can't
forgive me?

568
00:40:58,576 --> 00:41:00,276
Mom.

569
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,413
You don't have to be scared
of me.

570
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:10,853
?

571
00:41:16,094 --> 00:41:18,361
Glad you're back, man.
