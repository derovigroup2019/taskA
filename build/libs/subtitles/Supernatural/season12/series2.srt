1
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:07,778
Lucifer is gone.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,145
- To where?
- I don't know.

3
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:11,426
Lucifer's running
because he's weak.

4
00:00:11,526 --> 00:00:13,659
Hell will never
follow you.

5
00:00:14,863 --> 00:00:16,829
You gave me
what I needed most.

6
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:18,831
I want to do
the same for you.

7
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,000
Mom?

8
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:24,003
Toni Bevell. Men of Letters,
London Chapterhouse.

9
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:25,938
Where's Dean?
Dead.

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,340
Put the gun down.

11
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:32,378
I need you to give me
names and locations

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,613
and everything else.

13
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:36,449
Screw you.

14
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:40,520
Are you really
gonna make me do this?

15
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:44,490
You know what they say.

16
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:46,025
Good things come
to those --

17
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:47,827
Thanks, Mom.

18
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:52,398
We stop trying to break his
body. We break his mind.

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,567
Maybe you're not as good
at your job as you think.

20
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:00,273
No!

21
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:02,074
No!

22
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:17,890
Wow.

23
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:21,994
Isn't this
much more pleasant, Sam?

24
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:24,597
I got to say,
I did not see that happening.

25
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:27,834
Well, you know
what they say.

26
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:30,269
Opposites attract.

27
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:37,510
Oh, we'll get there, Sam.

28
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:39,912
Just another
couple of questions.

29
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:42,014
Hmm.

30
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:46,357

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,726
Fascinating.

33
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,427
But surely you exaggerate.

34
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:56,562
American Hunters
can't be as bad as you say.

35
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:59,432
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, they can.

36
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:00,800
What, they're not
in the U.K.?

37
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:02,635
No.

38
00:02:02,637 --> 00:02:04,570
No, they work for us.

39
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:08,774
Tools.
They kill. They don't think.

40
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:10,042
Huh.

41
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:12,511
Who recruited you
and your brother?

42
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:15,882
To whom do you report?

43
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,024
We, uh...

44
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:28,728
We're not just gonna
talk all night, right?

45
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,897
I haven't found anything on
these surveillance cameras.

46
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:32,498
I mean, it's like
they just disappeared.

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,533
<i>How about you?</i>
<i>Any of the local beat cops</i>

48
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:36,068
<i>see anybody</i>
<i>that shouldn't be there?</i>

49
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,739
It's pretty rural.
Not a lot of beat cops.

50
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:43,276
<i>I've checked all the motels,</i>
<i>abandoned buildings.</i>

51
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:45,645
<i>No sign of Sam.</i>

52
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:47,513
All right.

53
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:48,814
I don't know.

54
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:52,818
You know, check...
real-estate offices.

55
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,221
<i>See if anybody bought</i>
<i>a place or rented a place.</i>

56
00:02:55,223 --> 00:02:56,789
I mean, these people
had a freakin' plane.

57
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,291
Maybe they do things legit.

58
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:00,993
Okay, I understand.

59
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:02,461
I'll call you
in the morning.

60
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:03,663
Cass, hey.

61
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:05,932
<i>So, here's the thing.</i>

62
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:11,470
It's been kind of weird here
with, you know, Mom being back.

63
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:13,639
<i>It's like we don't know how</i>
<i>to act around each other,</i>

64
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:16,642
so we just kind of make
this small talk and act normal,

65
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:19,111
but it's --
it's so not normal.

66
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:21,547
Um, I'm -- I'm not sure.

67
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,282
What -- what has
she said to you?

68
00:03:23,284 --> 00:03:24,917
<i>Well, nothing.</i>

69
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,652
<i>That -- that -- that's</i>
<i>the whole point.</i>

70
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:28,421
Okay, what have you
said to her?

71
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:29,689
Well, nothing. I'm --

72
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:31,324
I don't know what
to say to her, you know?

73
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:34,694
It -- it's -- it's like
it's all just too much,

74
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:37,630
and...I don't want
to overwhelm her.

75
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:40,232
Don't make things
needlessly complicated,

76
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:43,736
as you humans tend to do.

77
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:44,804
<i>I'll call you.</i>

78
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:46,372
Yeah. Great.

79
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:49,342
That's helpful.
Thanks.

80
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:52,678
Any news on Sam?

81
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,982
Um, so somewhere
outsi-- here.

82
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:58,417
Somewhere outside
of Aldrich, Missouri.

83
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:01,087
Cass is going through it
with a fine-toothed comb,

84
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:03,856
and I've cracked
every database I could.

85
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:06,726
Every what?

86
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:08,194
Right.

87
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:09,862
No Internet
your first time around.

88
00:04:09,864 --> 00:04:13,132
Our house didn't have
an electric typewriter.

89
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:18,537
So...are you really afraid
of overwhelming me?

90
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:30,416
Mom, look, I am...

91
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:33,619
thrilled that you're back.

92
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:37,189
I mean, I'm so damn happy,
I-I-I can't even stand it.

93
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:39,825
I just...

94
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:43,763
it's just gonna take me a second
to catch up, you know?

95
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:44,997
Yeah, no, no.
Look, take -- take

96
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,299
all the time you need,
all right?

97
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:50,770
It's -- it is what it is.

98
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:58,310
And when we do find Sam...

99
00:04:58,312 --> 00:05:00,112
how am I gonna face him?

100
00:05:02,316 --> 00:05:03,783
What do you mean?

101
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:07,920
That yellow-eyed thing
would never have come for him

102
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:11,090
that night if I...

103
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,928
I started all of this.

104
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:26,639
It's just surprising that
for all your efforts,

105
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:28,874
yours and all the Hunters,

106
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:32,445
monsters remain rampant
in this country.

107
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,880
Yeah, we just, uh --

108
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:37,750
just keep plugging away,
I guess.

109
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:42,354
Do you ever think -- and don't
take this the wrong way --

110
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:45,591
that some of your soldiers
may have been compromised?

111
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:48,928
Or bought.

112
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,630
I mean...

113
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:53,799
No, I-I don't, um...

114
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,267
Is everything all right?

115
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,436
Is everything all right?

116
00:05:57,438 --> 00:05:59,738
No!

117
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:06,278
Is everything all right?

118
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:09,782
Is everything all right?

119
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:13,486
No!

120
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:18,190
I shouldn't -- I shouldn't
be talking to you.

121
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:24,763
You'll have to admit,
it was fun while it lasted.

122
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:29,935
What did you do to me?

123
00:06:29,937 --> 00:06:34,673
An hallucination created by
potion and powerful spell work.

124
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:41,580
So...was it good
for you?

125
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:46,385
Hm.

126
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:48,754
Sadly, I can't do
the spell again.

127
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:51,824
Your brain would liquify,
which we don't want.

128
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,759
Yet.

129
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,794
So...

130
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:59,098
I'll have to resort
to less...

131
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,700
pleasant methods.

132
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:19,618
Enhanced interrogation was never
part of my job description.

133
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:28,727
But as it turns out...

134
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:38,604
...I'm a quick study.

135
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:51,595
Hey, how'd you sleep?

136
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,964
I had dreams all night.

137
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:56,400
Good dreams?

138
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,569
Stuff I'd forgotten about.

139
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:01,739
Funny stuff your dad did.

140
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,507
He was a great father.

141
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:10,781
Hey, Cass,
what do you got?

142
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:13,617
I think I may have found
Sam's location.

143
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,219
<i>It's a farm.</i>

144
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:18,389
It appears empty,
but it was rented two weeks ago

145
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:20,658
to a woman with
an English accent.

146
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,759
Did you have
a look inside?

147
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,093
No.

148
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:24,995
No, it's --
it's powerfully warded.

149
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:26,764
Powerfully warded?

150
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:28,332
Okay, see, buddy, that --

151
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:30,935
that was your headline
right there.

152
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:34,872
Are we still discussing
the same thing?

153
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:36,173
Where are you?

154
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:37,274
<i>I'll text you the address.</i>

155
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:40,211
Okay, got it.
I'm on my way.

156
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:41,645
I'll get my coat.
Wait.

157
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,948
Uh

158
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,684
Okay.

159
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:48,485
Why don't I take
this one solo, okay?

160
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,754
We just -- we don't know
what we're walking into here.

161
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:54,024
We never know.
We're Hunters.

162
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:56,827
Right. Um...

163
00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:00,497
Okay, I-I can't do my job
if I'm worried about you.

164
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,235
Dean.

165
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:05,669
You won't have to be.

166
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,672
I can handle myself.

167
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,375
Okay?
All right, good talk.

168
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,546
Oh, boy.

169
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:20,351
Good morning, Sam.
Let's start again, shall we?

170
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:21,652
Take our time.

171
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:24,288
I've cleared my calendar.

172
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:31,762
I would like names
and locations of every Hunter...

173
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:34,898
the passcodes to each and every
Men of Letters database

174
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,836
held in the bunker,
and then -- oh, yes --

175
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:41,405
let's do discuss
your relationship

176
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:43,741
with the demon Ruby.

177
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:49,246
Mick.

178
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:51,548
You've been a bad girl, Toni.

179
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,352
And I've come to fetch you.

180
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:57,187
I have Sam Winchester.

181
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,056
He's close to breaking.
Just leave me be.

182
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,257
No can do.

183
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:03,661
You disobeyed orders.

184
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:07,765
Oh, and you should know,
your Ms. Watt -- quite dead.

185
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,934
Courtesy of Dean Winchester
and friends.

186
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:18,042
Sent me to
the grandest boarding schools,

187
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:22,212
but I was a wee imp and ran away
for a life in the arts.

188
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:26,950
Mother didn't speak to me
until I became a star.

189
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:29,620
A star?

190
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:31,488
Of?

191
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,894
Uh, do you follow
the Royal Ballet?

192
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:38,362
Not a bit.

193
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,933
The Royal Ballet.

194
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:46,870
You know, it reminds me
a lot of my story.

195
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:49,306
I left school to work
in a steel mill.

196
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:52,776
I rose up through the ranks,
and now I own half a dozen.

197
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,847
You're not serious?

198
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:58,782
More wine, madam?

199
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,253
You're like a boil
that keeps coming back

200
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,155
no matter how many times
I have it lanced.

201
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,623
Let me guess.

202
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,726
Your dinner date
is loaded, single,

203
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,694
and possibly
in delicate health.

204
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:12,629
What of it?
Well, just a stab,

205
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,566
but you probably don't want me
to reveal that his snookums

206
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:18,335
is 300 years old
and a witch.

207
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:22,039
Fergus, the man treats me
like a queen.

208
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,540
It's my chance
to leave behind

209
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,909
monsters and demons
and moldy hideouts.

210
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:29,780
So help me,
if you muck this up.

211
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:33,016
Oh, I wouldn't
dream of it, Mummy...

212
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:39,089
<i>if</i> you do me
one tiny favor.

213
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:42,092
Help me with Lucifer.

214
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:43,994
Lucifer?

215
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,763
I have
a score to settle.

216
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:02,579
Let's hear it
for Vince Vincente

217
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:04,148
and the rest of the band!

218
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,317
See you the next time around.
Good night, Cleveland!

219
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:09,486
- Whoo!
- I love you guys!

220
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:12,723
Good night, Cleveland!
We love you!

221
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:29,973
Hey, Vinny, we're hitting
the town tonight. Come with us.

222
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:32,142
Check out the wonders
of Cleveland.

223
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:35,512
Yeah, um...
I'm good, thanks.

224
00:12:35,514 --> 00:12:38,382
- Tommy, Tommy, come on!
- Yeah.

225
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:41,885
Hey, I'll catch up
with you guys later.

226
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,855
Dude, you --

227
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:47,791
You got to start
living your life, man.

228
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:50,427
You perform, you drink,
you sleep, perform, drink.

229
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:51,795
I-I get it.

230
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:54,031
I get it.

231
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:00,003
Look.

232
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:05,609
Vince, it's been years
since Jen died.

233
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:08,912
All I mean, brother,
is, don't you think

234
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,747
she'd want more
for you than just --

235
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,950
Get out of here, Tommy.

236
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:15,853
Go see Cleveland.

237
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:54,992
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

238
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:56,527
I'm your mother.

239
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:58,462
You have to do what I say.

240
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:02,432
Look.

241
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:03,767
They targeted the bunker.

242
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:06,637
They obviously know
a lot about you and Sam.

243
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,872
They'll be expecting you.

244
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:12,309
I'm the last person
they'd expect.

245
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:18,715
You were good at this,
weren't you?

246
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:21,051
Very.

247
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:25,088
The thing is, Hunters...

248
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,427
no matter how good they are,
they all end up the same way.

249
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:37,501
You know when you died,
it changed Dad.

250
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:42,105
I mean, he was Hell-bent
on finding out what happened.

251
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:46,610
The Hunter life,
it just took him over.

252
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:48,745
I guess I was the same.

253
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:52,849
But Sammy -- Sammy,
he was different.

254
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,586
He wanted out.

255
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,888
He went to school.
He went to Stanford.

256
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,657
Sam had a chance
to get out?

257
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:03,093
And he came back?

258
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:07,698
When Dad disappeared,
Sam and I looked around,

259
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,634
and something
became very clear.

260
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:12,402
That the only thing
we had in this world --

261
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:18,642
the only thing, aside from
this car -- was each other.

262
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,162
<i>Vince.</i>

263
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,364
<i>Vince.</i>

264
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:43,968
Hello, front desk?

265
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,837
Hello?

266
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,140
<i>Vince.</i>

267
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,476
<i>Vince.</i>

268
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,694
Vince.

269
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,497
Vince.

270
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,365
No.

271
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,568
Jen.

272
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,238
Yes, Vince.

273
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,406
How?

274
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,674
Why?

275
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:26,244
I needed
to say I'm sorry.

276
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:29,680
Swallowing those pills
was selfish.

277
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:35,686
I've had to live all these years
knowing how I treated you.

278
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,555
At the time,
leaving you seemed fair

279
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,224
since you left me
so many times.

280
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,130
All I want is you.

281
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,901
That can happen, Vince.

282
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,402
What can happen?

283
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:55,473
You and me together.

284
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,375
Are you a ghost?

285
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,877
No.

286
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:03,548
I'm an angel.

287
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,650
Those are real?

288
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:09,754
Real and very powerful,
Vince.

289
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,757
I can take away your pain.

290
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,892
Bring you peace.

291
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:19,497
You only have to do
one easy thing.

292
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:23,000
What?

293
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:26,103
Will you invite me in?

294
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,073
Yes.

295
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:38,149
Ostende illum mihi quen quaero.

296
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,718
What's the bloody
hold-up?

297
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,288
He's the one and only Satan
in the phonebook.

298
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,625
It's witchcraft,
not Google Maps.

299
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,460
And normally I'd have
a piece of hair

300
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,928
or a belonging
to lock on to.

301
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,263
You don't even know
what he looks like!

302
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,631
He has an aura.

303
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,132
Supreme evil.

304
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,434
Lock on to that.

305
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,237
Do I have
to do everything?

306
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,638
I can't believe
I'm once again

307
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,540
down some dank hole
seeking the devil!

308
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,342
When does it end?

309
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,778
It's exactly why I'm
retiring to Boca Raton.

310
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,313
With Ben.

311
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,948
Ben?

312
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,319
Who makes oatmeal
look fascinating.

313
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,689
He's successful, stable,
and I'll outlive him.

314
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,866
Lucifer?

315
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:31,702
I think so.

316
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,771
Yes. I'll give you
the location.

317
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,306
No, no, no.
Not now.

318
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,874
I just want to know
who we're dealing with

319
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,442
before we attack.

320
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,145
By "we," I presume you mean
the Winchesters

321
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,913
and their pet angel?

322
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,682
I don't need them.

323
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,884
Just you.

324
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,252
Look, it's obvious.

325
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,721
We got to put Lucifer
back in the cage.

326
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:54,058
You're the only one
that can do it.

327
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,495
Should've known.

328
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,063
No, Fergus!

329
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,899
I'll not be involved
in that nonsense again!

330
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:05,403
Maybe I should
tell Ben about you.

331
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:08,172
Maybe just kill him.

332
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:14,111
Either way,
it's bye-bye, Boca.

333
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:17,782
You are a hateful snake.

334
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,654
In any case, Lucifer can't be
sent back to the cage

335
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,656
while he's in a vessel.

336
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,291
He won't be.

337
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,694
Not by the time
we're ready.

338
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,025
Where's all this warding
you mentioned?

339
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,493
It's cloaked.

340
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:05,496
It's very powerful.

341
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,931
You brought your mother?

342
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,566
Hello, Castiel.

343
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,234
Yes, he did.

344
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,836
You sure
there's anyone inside?

345
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,304
No.

346
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,573
The agent said the lease
was handled long distance,

347
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,908
but someone
warded the house.

348
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,611
I'm gonna go
have a closer look.

349
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,815
Mom, I got this.

350
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,752
You can keep me from driving, Dean.
Not from hunting.

351
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,994
I'm locked out
by the warding.

352
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,329
I could use the company.

353
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,166
Thanks.

354
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,644
Dude, it's noon.
Let me in.

355
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,316
Whoa.

356
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,685
Look at you.

357
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:10,728
Pretty dressed up
for rehearsal, don't you think?

358
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,264
Rehearsal.

359
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,799
Brother, are you okay?

360
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,034
Yeah, I just can't
make it to rehearsal.

361
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,538
Yeah, you got better plans?

362
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,941
I do.

363
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:27,812
Vince, I'm serious.

364
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:28,813
So am I.

365
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:29,880
All right.

366
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,383
Look, stop screwing around.

367
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:48,065
I said I had plans.

368
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,182
Son of a bitch.

369
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:55,701
Screw yourself.

370
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:00,838
Dean.

371
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,207
I'm as happy
to see him as you are,

372
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,677
'cause while you may
be able to withstand

373
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,446
my snapping apart
your body joint by joint,

374
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,316
can you watch it
happen to Dean?

375
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,829
They told me you'd be here.

376
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,264
Really?

377
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:32,236
Get off my furniture,
squatter.

378
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:33,805
Lucifer.

379
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:38,076
Wearing Vince Vincente,
second-tier star.

380
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:41,279
I would've thought Bieber
was more your style.

381
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:48,653
You're either mad or dim.

382
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:52,857
I have a proposal.

383
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:57,929
I mean, why in Hell would
you want to rule over a motley,

384
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,832
witless crew of demons?

385
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,901
God's on sabbatical again.

386
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,870
You could reclaim Heaven.

387
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:09,741
Now, that's real estate
that's worth ruling.

388
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:13,077
I can handle
the branch office.

389
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,313
Hmm.

390
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:22,720
Or...I could raise my hand,
smite you into oblivion.

391
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:27,658
Manete. Manete. Manete.

392
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,263
Manete. Manete. Manete.

393
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:33,931
Manete.

394
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,466
Problem?
Manete.

395
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:37,135
Manete.

396
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,970
Manete. Manete.

397
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:41,839
Mummy's little
paralyzing spell.

398
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,975
Trust me, it works.

399
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:45,977
Trust me.

400
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,512
Not for long.

401
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:50,681
Oh...

402
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:53,050
Holy water?

403
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,952
Yeah?

404
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:57,989
Ooh, ouch.

405
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:00,091
Don't bore me.

406
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:03,761
Well, actually,
it's top-shelf sulfuric acid.

407
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:08,065
Harmless to you, I know,
but to your vessel, not so much.

408
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,885
Passcodes, Sam.

409
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,656
Not yet?

410
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:37,695
Anything to add?

411
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:42,967
No. No, I just came by
for some tea and a beating.

412
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:44,469
Really?

413
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:46,637
See, I thought you might
be on for a little chat

414
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:49,273
about your mate,
Benjamin Lafitte.

415
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:52,577
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:54,479
You called him Benny.

417
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,548
You know, the vampire
whom you released from Purgatory

418
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:01,352
and befriended.

419
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:02,920
I see.

420
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,489
Well...

421
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:07,592
the English are nothing
if not patient.

422
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,380
Now.

423
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:33,084
His essence,
send it back to the cage.

424
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:36,254
Wah tay, fay roh lah!

425
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:40,691
Mother!

426
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:43,027
Manete!

427
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:49,333
Manete!

428
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,435
Manete!
It's not working.

429
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:54,071
Manete! Manete!

430
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,173
Bad, bad Crowley.

431
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,681
Seriously?

432
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,691
You spoil that boy.

433
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:51,829
Dean.

434
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,497
Hey.

435
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,399
I thought you were dead.

436
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,835
I'm not sure that I'm <i>not.</i>

437
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,170
So?
I'll tell you.

438
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:00,504
I'll tell you
everything, okay?

439
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:04,008
First off,
who's Angry Spice?

440
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:08,980
She, uh -- she's --
she's Men of Letters.

441
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:11,616
Uh, British Men of Letters.

442
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:13,818
Is that a thing?
What the hell?

443
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,453
Aren't we supposed
to be on the same team?

444
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,424
Oh, God.

445
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:24,629
Gentlemen.
So, to recap --

446
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:27,498
you live in
the Men of Letters bunker,

447
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,000
awash in the world's
greatest collection

448
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:32,770
of occult knowledge,
and yet you know "nothing."

449
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:35,006
Right.

450
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:38,242
What a waste.

451
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:41,312
It seems you apes have never
read a single book.

452
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:43,180
The Men of Letters
has a long tradition

453
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:45,483
of intellectual excellence.

454
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:48,919
In London, we've undertaken
exhaustive studies

455
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,589
of even the most arcane topics.

456
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:59,664
For example, parts of the body
most sensitive to intense pain.

457
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,003
The ear drum.

458
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:08,906
Decaying tooth.

459
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:11,442
Below the belt, of course.

460
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:16,080
And my favorite --
under the eyelid.

461
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:21,385
Did you know it's possible
to die from pain?

462
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:29,527
Get away from my boys.

463
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,265
Mom?

464
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,033
Yeah.

465
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,906
Drop it.

466
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:47,111
Ground.

467
00:30:51,818 --> 00:30:53,117
That's the ground.

468
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,737
Holy crap.

469
00:31:31,858 --> 00:31:32,957
Xi.

470
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:38,763
Kill the spell now.

471
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,134
I'm not kidding.

472
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:46,604
Shoot me, and your mother
has no chance.

473
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:52,443
The gun.

474
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:04,755
Dean!

475
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,757
It's okay.

476
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,426
She was using a Chinese
mind-control technique.

477
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,228
Hard to do when
you're unconscious.

478
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:18,235
Turns out this ape
did read a book or two.

479
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:19,870
Well played.

480
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:32,224
What you were told
is basically true.

481
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,583
We were keen on knowing
about the two of you,

482
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,753
seeing as you seem to be
partially carrying on

483
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,121
the Men of Letters' work here

484
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,390
now that the American chapter
is defunct.

485
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:45,761
So you sic your attack dog
on us to what, say hi?

486
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:49,332
Well, part of our group
suspect some kind of malfeasance

487
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,034
amongst
you American Hunters.

488
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,637
No argument --
Lady Bevell went too far.

489
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,205
I deeply apologize.

490
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,740
Mm.

491
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,744
She'll face consequences
in London.

492
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,379
I'll tell you what,
why don't you take a walk,

493
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,681
and she can face those
consequences right here and now?

494
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,855
She's ours.

495
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,357
We'll take care of her.

496
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,860
Now, I'm here to
extend an olive branch.

497
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,161
We want to work with you.

498
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,098
Let me ask you a question,
uh, Mick is it?

499
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,401
Why would we believe
any of this?

500
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:31,674
Lads...if I wasn't sincere,
if I meant you harm,

501
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,509
there's a dozen ways
I could've come in here

502
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,580
and taken you all prisoner
instead of being unarmed.

503
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,885
Not to mention I powered down
all the wardings in this shack

504
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,589
so your attack dog
could come in.

505
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,758
I reckon you could finish me off
without breaking a sweat.

506
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,292
Am I right?

507
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,396
I don't sweat
under any circumstances.

508
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,935
My number.

509
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:04,573
Take your time, cool down,
and just think it over.

510
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:09,412
And what have you got to lose,
except your worst nightmares?

511
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,758
Oh, that was fantastic.
Thank you, Mom.

512
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,693
All I did was point

513
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,395
at some stuff
on a take-out menu.

514
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:31,434
I would've cooked,
but I, uh...don't.

515
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,269
Well, now, wait.

516
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,870
Your meat loaf was amazing.

517
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,505
Came from
the Piggly Wiggly.

518
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,741
Sorry to
burst your bubble.

519
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,213
But do you still
like pie?

520
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,949
I mean...

521
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,756
Sam.

522
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,092
You keep looking at me like
I'm going to explode.

523
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,595
I'm sorry.

524
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,464
Oh!

525
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,332
But what do we think?

526
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,135
Are we buying that Brit's whole
"Let's be friends" routine?

527
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:09,104
- No. No way.
- No.

528
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,510
Mmm.

529
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,314
Could you eat that
any faster?

530
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,884
No.
No, I cannot.

531
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,823
Well, we should
call the Internet

532
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,192
and find out as much
as we can about these people.

533
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,698
Did I say that right?

534
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,899
So close.

535
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,634
Yeah, it was close.

536
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,635
You want any?

537
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,304
No. Uh, not now.

538
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:57,353
You know, I got to say,
Rowena,

539
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:01,957
I took one look at you,
and all I wanted

540
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:06,161
was to snap
your miserable neck again.

541
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:09,031
And keep it snapped
this time.

542
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,104
But I think
I've decided against it.

543
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,274
You won't regret it, sir.

544
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,743
I'm done with all this.

545
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,545
I'll stay far, far away,

546
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,614
sipping martinis with
republicans at my tennis club.

547
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,319
You're missing my point.

548
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,688
A witch
as gifted as yourself,

549
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,525
with access to the Book
of the Damned to boot,

550
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:41,730
would be much more valuable
as a prisoner.

551
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,165
What?

552
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,968
How's that saying go?

553
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,071
Mm, friends close...

554
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,810
...enemies closer.

555
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,712
No.

556
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,781
No!

557
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,884
Yes?

558
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,756
Hey.
Hi.

559
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,425
Sorry. I hope
I didn't wake you up.

560
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,494
I-I, uh...wanted
to bring you this.

561
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,598
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

562
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,833
I don't know if
you drink tea, but...

563
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:21,503
- I do.
- Good.

564
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:27,810
Uh, and I wanted to say...
if you ever want to talk,

565
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,745
I know what it's like
to come back

566
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:34,650
and not feel like
you really fit.

567
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:41,223
I just have so much about
you boys to catch up on.

568
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,558
Mother stuff.

569
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,863
You know, first tooth,
first crush.

570
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:51,967
Yeah.

571
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:55,504
I just have a lot
of blanks to fill in.

572
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,539
Right, uh...

573
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,311
Dad's journal.

574
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,413
His writing, his words.

575
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,248
Helped me
fill in some blanks,

576
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,585
answer some questions
I didn't know I had.

577
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:15,958
And, you know, it -- it --
it keeps him with us, sort of.

578
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,063
Thank you.

579
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,933
Good night.

580
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:28,437
Dean said you got out
of hunting.

581
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,272
Yeah.

582
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,074
And yet here you are.

583
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,514
Well, this is my family.

584
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,583
My family hunts, you know?
It's what we do.

585
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,927
Mom.

586
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,565
For me...

587
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,234
just, um...

588
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:05,007
having you here...

589
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,743
fills in
the biggest blank.

590
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:11,613
[ Heart's "Lost Angel" plays ]

591
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:28,263
? As it was before ?

592
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:32,735
? Shall it ever, ever be ?

593
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:43,812
? Hear it on the crying wind ?

594
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:50,018
? Hear it weeping on the sea ?

595
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:55,057
? Lost angel, find us now ?

596
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,560
? From the clouds above ?

597
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:03,732
? Right down to the ground ?

598
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,970
? Lost angel ?

599
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,685
I will not
get on that plane.

600
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:26,288
Yes, you will.

601
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,924
Your mission was
to identify American Hunters

602
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,659
and gain their trust.

603
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,194
That's what
the home office wants.

604
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,662
Honey, not vinegar.

605
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:37,966
I have a dossier,
and I am just getting started.

606
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,335
They've also had
their fair share of successes.

607
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:43,572
If our goal is to end
the supernatural threat here,

608
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,808
we need to destroy
every obstacle.

609
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,576
The Winchesters,
these American Hunters,

610
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,211
they're no better
than the monsters

611
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,146
they fail to control.

612
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,649
They need
to be eliminated.

613
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,654
Mick.

614
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,990
If push comes to shove,
your ladyship,

615
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,092
I'm prepared for that.

616
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:07,462
You'll get
your hands dirty?

617
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:10,532
Well, we have
Mr. Ketch for that.

618
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,135
You'll send for him?

619
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,571
I already have.

620
