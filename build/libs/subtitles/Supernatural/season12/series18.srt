1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,402
Mrs. Winchester,

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:05,304
I believe you're drawn
to danger.

3
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:07,906
Drink? Have you
talked to mom lately?

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,308
Oh, shouldn't worry about
your mum.

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,076
Her and ketch make quite a team.

6
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:12,511
Would you want<i> your</i> mom
working with him?

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,581
Well, that was unexpected.

8
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,149
Dr. Hess. I didn't think
you left London.

9
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,251
I have been tasked
by the other elders

10
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:23,422
to fix this rapidly
deteriorating situation.

11
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:26,158
Dr. Hess...

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,961
These hunters are out
of control. Exterminate them.

13
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,596
The brothers Winchester,
in particular.

14
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:55,421
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go.

15
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:58,090
What?
I got work tomorrow, so...

16
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,260
Naw, dude. Stick around.
Have another beer.

17
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:03,996
Enjoy the show.

18
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,403
You know you're a freak, right?

19
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,238
Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,677
Cheers, bud.

21
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,661
Hey.

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,267
Ohh, man. Dude.

23
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,070
Daryn! What is this, man?

24
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,272
Hey, real funny, Daryn!

25
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,740
Ha ha!

26
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,143
Hey! Daryn?

27
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,564
No. No.

28
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,199
No, no, no!

29
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,116
<i>This is my voicemail.</i>

30
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,485
<i>Make your voice a mail.</i>
Come on.

31
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,687
Cass, it's me.

32
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,556
I've been trying to get ahold
of you for days.

33
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:13,559
I don't know what's going on,
but we got a line on Dagon...

34
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,594
And we got
our asses handed to us,

35
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,329
even with the Colt.

36
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:21,166
So... Could really use
the backup.

37
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,302
Call me back.

38
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,804
So no luck with Cass, huh?

39
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,407
Yeah, still awol.

40
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,110
All right, so let's find him.

41
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,545
I've been trying, Sam.

42
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,647
The GPS on his phone
is turned off,

43
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,316
and there's nothing in
the system about some weird guy

44
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,185
in a trench coat getting
arrested or turning up dead.

45
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,121
Right.

46
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,890
Dean, it's Cass.

47
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,491
I mean, this isn't
the first time

48
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,126
he's dropped off the map,
you know?

49
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,495
And whatever's happening,
he'll be fine.

50
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,433
He always is.

51
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,168
Yeah.

52
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,237
What 'bout you?

53
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,638
You got anything there,
reading rainbow?

54
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,139
I stayed up all night,

55
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,574
going through every book
we have on demons,

56
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,776
and it turns out we have
a lot of books on demons.

57
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,378
Anything on Dagon?

58
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,547
Mentions here and there,
but nothing we can use.

59
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,515
I guess the, uh, princes of hell
are pretty good

60
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,883
at staying off the radar.

61
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,852
Well, yeah, isn't that
kind of their thing?

62
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,924
Hmm.
Just got an e-mail from Mick.

63
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,560
It's a case.

64
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,928
Good.

65
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,930
Looks like a guy named
Jarrod Hayes

66
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:28,267
disappeared in
tomahawk, Wisconsin, a week ago.

67
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,835
No witnesses. No body.

68
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,871
But Mick says this place has a history.
Meaning?

69
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,539
Well, it means a lot of people
go missing in tomahawk,

70
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,542
one a year, every year,
from 1898 to 1997,

71
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,212
and then nothing until now.

72
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:41,813
So 20 years?

73
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,915
Yeah. So maybe they're
starting up again?

74
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,917
Maybe it's a cycle of some sort?

75
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,753
Well...

76
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,288
One way to find out.

77
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,291
Pew.

78
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,363
It's time.

79
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:15,414
I'm sorry, but why the feds
interested in Jarrod Hayes?

80
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,482
Just followin' orders.

81
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,685
Yeah, um...

82
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,987
So what can you tell us
about the case?

83
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,757
Well... Nothing much to tell.

84
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,894
Jarrod and his friends were
hanging out at weather top.

85
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,563
This make-out spot the kids use
out at the woods.

86
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:36,468
And then he ditched his pals
to hoof it home.

87
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,836
Never made it.

88
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,471
So somebody snagged him?

89
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:40,839
Mm.

90
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,708
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

91
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,410
Look, maybe Jarrod did get got.

92
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,778
We're working every lead.

93
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,247
But you ask me, he just bailed.

94
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:52,017
And why would he do that?
Jarrod's had it rough.

95
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,286
Mom left years ago.
And his dad...

96
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,856
Well, let's just say Jarrod
"fell down the stairs a lot,"

97
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,624
you know what I mean.
Wait a second.

98
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,660
Mm. If you knew he was being
abused, why didn't you...

99
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:04,730
We tried. Trying to take a child
from his parents,

100
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:08,033
even if they're the worst people
in the world, not easy.

101
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,902
Did you talk to his old man?

102
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,438
Can't. Not really.

103
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,741
Guy stroked out
a couple years ago.

104
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,510
Breathes through a tube.

105
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,779
Guess who gets
to take care of him?

106
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,414
Can you imagine having
to spoon-feed

107
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,815
the guy that wailed on you
for all those years?

108
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:27,519
Everybody's got
a breaking point.

109
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,888
If Jarrod did blow town,
I wouldn't blame him.

110
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,390
You said that
he was with friends

111
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,691
the night Jarrod went missing.

112
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,760
Yeah, did any of them
say anything?

113
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,395
Nothing worth repeatin'.

114
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,732
Ain't he precious?

115
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,570
Uh-huh. Any idea where
we can find these friends?

116
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,806
Oh, yeah. Sure.

117
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,847
Daryn Boston?

118
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,483
Agents Stark and Martell, FBI.

119
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,353
Hell.

120
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,555
Yeah, no, it's cool.

121
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,725
Medicinal purposes, right?

122
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,995
Uh... Yes?

123
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,930
Yeah.

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,567
We just, uh, wanted to talk

125
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,903
about the night
Jarrod Hayes went missing.

126
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,738
What about it?

127
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,573
Well, the sheriff says
you were with him.

128
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,943
Yeah, well, the sheriff
is a jackass, all right?

129
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,780
Look, he thinks Jarrod
just skipped town.

130
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,949
You don't?
I know he didn't.

131
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,684
Did you tell that to the cops?

132
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,420
Man, sheriff bishop's
not gonna believe me.

133
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:38,457
We got... History.

134
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,925
History?

135
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,660
Any time something happens
in this town,

136
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,429
he brings me in for questioning.

137
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,798
Why is that?

138
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,634
Why do you think?
Right.

139
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,671
Well, look, if you won't
tell the sheriff what you saw,

140
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,673
how 'bout you tell us?

141
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,045
<i>Hey! Daryn!</i>

142
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,550
Look,
I ran to save Jarrod, okay?

143
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,786
But...
<i>No, no, no!</i>

144
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,523
The monster, it got him.

145
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,791
Monster?

146
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,694
Black bill.

147
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,735
Hi! "Black bill" is a
local urban legend,

148
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,404
dates back more than a hundred years.
Warm it up?

149
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,107
Thank you.
A folklore story from 1907

150
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,976
that... that mentions
that...

151
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,078
Uh, back then, he was called
"black William."

152
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,714
So it looks like some time
between then and...

153
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,549
Dude, focus.

154
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,751
I am focused. Yeah, black bill.
What do you got?

155
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,188
All right, well,
he lives in the woods,

156
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,557
so he's like
a local Jersey devil.

157
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,192
And apparently, he has
the head of a goat.

158
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,793
A goat?

159
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,096
Like... Goat?

160
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,765
Yeah, a goat.

161
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,500
Well, maybe that's
what Daryn saw.

162
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,435
Unless you think he was lying.
Yeah. Be right back.

163
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,804
Mm, nah, I think he's a little
too freaked out to be lying.

164
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,107
So we got a, uh, goat dude with
a name like a pirate,

165
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,909
which is a little insane,
even for us.

166
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,077
And that bar is...
Super high.

167
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,980
So if it is real, what the hell is it?
I'm not sure.

168
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,650
I mean, there's tons
of human-animal hybrid lore

169
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,485
dating back all the way
to ancient Egypt.

170
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,920
Right, well, why don't you
figure out what the hell it is,

171
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,522
and I'll figure out a way
to kill it. Okay?

172
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,457
All right.

173
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,593
Right. Don't wait up.

174
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,528
What? I already figured
out a way to kill it.

175
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,931
How did you... you don't
even know what<i> it</i> is.

176
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,466
The Colt. Dusts anything.

177
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:32,137
Work smarter, Sammy, not harder.

178
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,005
Oh, don't do
the hot coffee thing.

179
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,575
Boy, this coffee is<i> hot.</i>

180
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,209
Kind of like...

181
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,145
Hi.

182
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,681
What's your name?
Carmen.

183
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,170
Sorry.

184
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,838
Damn it, Pete!

185
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,673
Daryn...

186
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,710
I don't wanna be
the bad guy here, but...

187
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,945
You clocked in late.

188
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,081
Again.
Yeah, and?

189
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,783
And you're really painting me
in a corner here, pal.

190
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,786
Look, I know... I know that you
and Jarrod, you were close.

191
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,755
And I liked him, too.

192
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,091
He was a-a valued employee

193
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,826
and he was a friend.

194
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,194
Really?
Yeah.

195
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,762
'Cause after you put him
on part-time,

196
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,964
he pretty much hated you.

197
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,602
Well, I would say that
that was his prerogative.

198
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:42,107
But you can't keep using him
as an excuse to blow off work.

199
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,843
Okay?
Yeah.

200
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,745
Okay.

201
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,246
Daryn, Daryn.

202
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,282
One more thing.

203
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,319
You gotta lay off the reefer.

204
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,920
All right?

205
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,089
At least for tomorrow.

206
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,824
It's a big day.

207
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,689
Aah!

208
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,691
Aah! Aah! Aah!

209
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,374
Yeah. No, no, no.
I understand.

210
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,177
Yeah. Well...
Yeah, gotta go.

211
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,315
I'll see you later.

212
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,983
Okay.

213
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,020
- Mm.
- Order up.

214
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,657
Ahh.

215
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,193
Good night?
Awesome.

216
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:11,996
It was an awesome night.
So awesome.

217
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,665
Ah.

218
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,500
You gonna eat that?

219
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,268
Uh...

220
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,137
Guess not. Be my guest.

221
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,506
I mean, would it kill you
to order pancakes? Once?

222
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,575
Okay, fine. You...
No, no. No.

223
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,444
I'll deal.

224
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,613
How was your night?

225
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:32,517
Busy. A different kind
of a busy, but good.

226
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,220
Right. Books.
Anything on goat dude?

227
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,721
Yeah, little bit.

228
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,590
I have some idea
what we're dealing with.

229
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,425
Look at this.

230
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,460
It's a satyr...

231
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,395
Half man, half goat
from Greek mythology.

232
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,964
Oh, come on.
This guy's adorable.

233
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,066
He plays a freakin' flute.

234
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,702
Yeah, Dean. That's...
That's pan. It's his flute.

235
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,704
Mm.

236
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:55,640
So listen, satyrs are creatures
of uncontrollable lust.

237
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:59,043
They would lead people to
the woods for massive orgies.

238
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,411
Nice.

239
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,981
And when the fun was over,
the satyr would,

240
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,617
"feast upon the flesh of
his victims until his belly

241
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,720
was full to bursting with
their moist, slippery meat."

242
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,390
That's descriptive. Uh...

243
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,159
All right, what do we do?

244
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:17,061
Well, I was thinking that maybe
we could go talk to Daryn,

245
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,397
see if this is, indeed,
what he saw.

246
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,499
But?
But his mom told me

247
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,668
Daryn never made it home
from work last night.

248
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:29,340
No screwups, right?

249
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,409
Excuse me, sir.

250
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,611
Hi. Agents Stark and Martell,
FBI.

251
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:36,080
Uh, we're looking for
Daryn Boston.

252
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:39,217
Uh, Daryn?
Is he in trouble?

253
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,419
No, no, no, not at all. We...
We spoke with him yesterday.

254
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,154
Just wanna ask
a few follow-up questions.

255
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,689
I don't suppose he's around.

256
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,525
No, Daryn... Daryn didn't
show up for work today.

257
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:52,397
So when was the last time
you saw him?

258
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,433
Oh, last night.
Closed up.

259
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,035
Talked about our big day today.

260
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,803
What big day?

261
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,139
You see that walking clipboard
over there?

262
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,708
Yeah.
That's a health inspector.

263
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,376
He's trying to shut us down.

264
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,213
How come?
This place is spotless.

265
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:11,115
It cleans up pretty nice,
but our equipment,

266
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,418
it's a little out of date.

267
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,487
Can't you upgrade?
We would if we could.

268
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,389
Business isn't exactly booming.

269
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,792
We had to shut down half
the plant three months back.

270
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:23,595
Meanwhile, our owner would
rather play sheriff

271
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:26,064
than actually take care of business.
Wait a second.

272
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,499
You're telling me that
sheriff bishop owns this place?

273
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,803
Yeah. Barrett bishop, Jr.

274
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:34,606
Heir to the bishop meat empire.

275
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:39,377
His family, they've owned
this plant for... Forever.

276
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,714
Barry's inside. He's hopin'
to sweet talk the inspector.

277
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,350
You ask me, it's too little,
<i>way</i> too late.

278
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,652
Mr. Garfinkle.

279
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,354
Excuse me.

280
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,256
Sure.

281
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:54,092
So we roll into town,
look into a case,

282
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,460
talk to the local badge...

283
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,095
And then our one witness
goes missing.

284
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,197
Last place he was seen
owned by the sheriff.

285
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,599
Sound like a coincidence?

286
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,835
Oh.

287
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,538
You hungry? I'm hungry.

288
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,374
Excuse me, sheriff.

289
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,342
Agents.
What are you guys doin' here?

290
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,877
Well, we could ask you
the same thing,

291
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,681
except... Oh, right.
You run the joint.

292
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,217
Well,
my name's on the paperwork.

293
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,719
Pete handles the day to day.

294
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,222
Are you still trying
to chase down Jarrod Hayes?

295
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,591
Yeah, and, uh, now Daryn Boston.

296
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,860
Yeah. Seems to have
gone missing, too.

297
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:31,296
Jeez. First I've heard of it.

298
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,830
Yeah.

299
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,667
So tell us, what have you heard
about black bill?

300
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,468
I'm sorry.
Black bill.

301
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,505
Daryn told us he saw
black bill attack Jarrod Hayes.

302
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,640
He didn't wanna tell ya 'cause he
didn't think you'd believe him.

303
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:46,577
Well... well...
Yeah. He's right.

304
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,614
Look, 'round here,
parents tell their kids

305
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,683
not to go into the woods
or black bill will get 'em.

306
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,484
He's the bogeyman.

307
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,387
Everyone knows that
the bogeyman ain't real.

308
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,390
Sure about that? Seems like a lot
of people go missing in this town.

309
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,626
Yeah, one a year every year
up until '97.

310
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,828
Yeah. Okay.

311
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,363
I mean, people come to town,

312
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,231
they work in the plant
for a while,

313
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,599
then they get bored
and restless,

314
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,369
and they, you know, move on.

315
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,737
And Daryn?

316
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,406
You know, maybe Daryn thinks
he say black bill,

317
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,908
but let's be honest.

318
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,277
Kid was drunk, high, or both.

319
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,346
And I'll bet you
dollars to doughnuts,

320
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,815
Daryn's just holed up,
sleeping one off.

321
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,685
Hell, he's probably waking up
right now, safe and sound.

322
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,775
Hey!

323
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,713
Help, please!

324
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,281
Help!

325
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:02,854
Help me!

326
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,290
Well, sheriff's not acting
suspicious at all.

327
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,893
Right. Yeah, but how is he
connected to goat dude?

328
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,962
Now that's a good question.

329
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,733
Help!

330
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:02,814
Help! Help! Please!

331
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:06,517
Help me! Help! Help! Help!

332
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,820
Help! Aah!

333
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,796
Seriously? Dean?

334
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,532
After what we just saw,
how... how can you eat?

335
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,067
Grow up, Sam, okay?

336
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,037
Burger's beef, bacon's pig,
soylent green's people.

337
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,905
But this... this...

338
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,707
This is heaven.

339
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,542
Wow.

340
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,778
Right. Um, so, uh,
what's the word?

341
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,613
You find anything?
Mm.

342
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,582
Yeah, kind of.

343
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:41,752
So I cross-checked all the names
of the people who went missing

344
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,921
with the employee roster
at billhook meats.

345
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,591
And? Any more of the vics
work at the plant?

346
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,526
Try all of 'em.

347
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,461
All of 'em? Seriously?

348
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,364
So I guess that means,
safe to say that, uh,

349
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,766
black bill is definitely
connected to the plant?

350
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,369
Yeah.
Or the family that runs it.

351
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,937
Or both.

352
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,220
Well, maybe they just run
an evil petting zoo on the side.

353
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,112
So I, uh, spent some time
at the hall of records.

354
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,914
The bishops founded tomahawk.

355
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,849
Everything.
This is a company town.

356
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,485
If you lived here,
you worked at the plant.

357
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,355
The bishops owned all
the houses, all the businesses.

358
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,358
Or they did
until a few years ago.

359
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,426
Looks like the sheriff
has been selling off

360
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,529
all of their family property.

361
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,897
Uh, everything, really...
Hmm.

362
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,465
For the plant

363
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,501
and the family estate.

364
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,737
Wow. So who lives
at the Addams family house?

365
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,074
It's Mick.
Okay.

366
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,076
Tell him we're cool.

367
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,579
So creepy house?

368
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,815
Creepy house.

369
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,754
It's clear. Onward.

370
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,824
Now remember your orders.

371
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,560
By the time we leave,

372
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,428
Dr. Hess wants to know
everything

373
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,730
about our "friends"
the Winchesters...

374
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,066
Their allies, their habits.

375
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:04,669
How does Sam get his hair
so shiny?

376
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,171
How many ratty flannels
does Dean own?

377
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:11,175
So work quick, work quiet,
and leave no trace.

378
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:14,679
Oh, and apparently, Mick let
Sam and Dean get their hands

379
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:17,014
on the bloody Colt.

380
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,450
Find it, huh?

381
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,661
Looks empty.

382
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,965
Well, why don't we check
inside? Maybe we'll get lucky.

383
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,214
Dean.

384
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:25,583
I'd say we just got lucky.

385
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,555
Wow.

386
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,799
Hello?

387
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,768
Goat dude?

388
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,069
Why is it always the rich ones?

389
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:21,238
I mean, what, are they, like,
"croquet's all right."

390
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
But you know what'd be great?

391
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:25,643
"Murder."

392
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,576
Hiya, sheriff.

393
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,223
Talk.

394
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,291
This is not what it looks like.
Really?

395
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,594
'Cause it looks like
a straight up murder room to me.

396
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,563
Sheriff, what's goin' on?

397
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:25,603
Oh, you...
You won't believe me.

398
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,206
Try us.

399
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:32,143
We're pretty open mind.

400
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,615
My family, we...

401
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:40,284
Got a secret.

402
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,253
All the best ones do.

403
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,522
Is this about black bill?

404
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:48,125
No. I mean, yeah,
but... He's not real.

405
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,432
Black bill, he's... Us.

406
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,434
Come again?

407
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,402
Uh...

408
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:03,974
Growing up, my father'd tell me
stories about a monster.

409
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:08,512
Lived under our house
and made our family rich.

410
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:12,583
All we had to do was...
Was feed it.

411
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:15,519
Feed it what?
Blood.

412
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,556
Human blood.

413
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,927
My dad, his dad,
and all the way back,

414
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,130
they'd go out and grab
some poor son of a bitch,

415
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,432
bring 'em here and...

416
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,474
when they did it
they wore a mask.

417
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,309
<i>Black bill...</i>

418
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,478
<i>We made him up.</i>

419
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,346
So goat dude is just a dude?

420
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,549
Then who's the monster?

421
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,218
Moloch.

422
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,354
God of sacrifice.

423
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:53,958
What, I'm sorry. You... you have
a god living in your basement?

424
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,927
Yeah, one of my people way back,
they bound Moloch,

425
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,597
locked him away...

426
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,232
<i>Starved him.</i>

427
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:03,400
<i>My family, that's what we did.</i>

428
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,970
<i>We let the god get
so hungry that</i>

429
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:08,439
<i>he'd do anything for blood.</i>

430
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:10,040
Aah!

431
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,478
<i>Moloch used his power
to make us rich.</i>

432
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:21,652
<i>After my father died in '97,
I put a stop to all of that.</i>

433
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,154
Look, I couldn't...

434
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,357
I never killed anybody.
I just wanted to help people

435
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,059
to make up for all the bad
we've done.

436
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,262
I wanted...

437
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:33,330
To leave a legacy.

438
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,399
Well, aren't you just a peach?

439
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,134
So what happened to Moloch?

440
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,338
I kept him locked up.

441
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,574
Hoped he'd starve to death.

442
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:46,210
Locked up where?

443
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,793
It's empty.
What?

444
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:38,796
It's empty.
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

445
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,136
Stay here. Keep an eye on him.

446
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:49,239
What? Dean, there could be
a god up there.

447
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,508
I'm cool.

448
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,784
Aah!

449
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:09,620
Dean?

450
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:18,729
Hey!

451
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,565
Hey! Open up!

452
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:28,639
Hey!

453
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,917
Here. Here.

454
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,689
What are you doing? I'm trying
to track Dean's cellphone.

455
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,926
All right, got it. Let's go.

456
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,769
Just as I thought.

457
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:00,971
Can't see a damn thing.

458
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:19,716
Mm.

459
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,824
Hiya, Pete. Nice digs.

460
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,159
I didn't expect to see you
again, agent.

461
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,962
I went to the house
looking for my brother.

462
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,231
Brother?
Barry.

463
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:37,801
Different moms, same daddy.

464
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,707
Old man bishop, he, uh,

465
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,642
he had an eye for the ladies.

466
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:49,713
Everyone in town knew about it,
but didn't make a difference.

467
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:54,284
Barry grew up in the big house.
I grew up in a double wide.

468
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,220
Does that sound fair to you?

469
00:30:56,222 --> 00:31:00,057
Honestly? Sounds like
a bad episode of "dynasty."

470
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,097
You got a lot of jokes.

471
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,766
Yeah, right now,
that's about all I got.

472
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,702
Right.

473
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,737
You know what I got?

474
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,275
A god.

475
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,744
Moloch.

476
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,647
Bingo!

477
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:26,717
With Barry giving away
the family fortune like that,

478
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,086
I had to get creative.

479
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,421
<i>I went to the old house,
trying to get my hands on</i>

480
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,223
<i>anything I could sell.</i>

481
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,860
<i>But I found somethin' else.</i>

482
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,435
Moloch.

483
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:48,205
<i>He told me he'd make me rich.</i>

484
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:51,174
<i>He told me he'd solve
all my problems.</i>

485
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,279
<i>All I had to do was feed him.</i>

486
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:58,415
And hell, I'm a bishop.

487
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,183
That's what we do, right?

488
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:03,053
Hunting people. Killing them.

489
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:05,088
The family business.

490
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,024
Moloch's been starved
for 20 years.

491
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,860
It's gonna take a few meals
for him to get his mojo goin',

492
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:13,897
but then...
Oh, we are back, baby.

493
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:17,801
Yeah. I'm savin' this town.

494
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:19,903
Well, I'll tell that
to Jarrod and Daryn.

495
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:23,840
Jarrod was a screwup.
He got what he deserved.

496
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:27,044
And Daryn? Well, sorry, bud,
but once he talked,

497
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:28,812
he had to go.

498
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,180
Loose ends, you know?

499
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,950
Loose ends. Come on!
Mm.

500
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:36,420
My jackass half-brother was
supposed to be the next meal,

501
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:37,988
but you'll do.

502
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,356
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

503
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:42,859
W... Pete, let's just
talk about this.

504
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:46,063
Listen...
Let's...

505
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:48,198
It'll be over soon.

506
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,033
Thanks for helpin' out!

507
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,468
What...

508
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,008
The sweep's complete, sir.

509
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,843
We've photographed
and catalogued every inch.

510
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,179
And the Colt?
I'm afraid not.

511
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,880
The Winchesters must have it.

512
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,215
Bugger.

513
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,384
Shall we go?
Yes.

514
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:11,922
Just one last thing.

515
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:15,993
Now then, I could use a pint.

516
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,954
Pete! Pete!

517
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,326
Dean?

518
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,626
Dean?

519
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,564
Dean?

520
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,472
Come on, you son of a bitch.

521
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,081
Huh.

522
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,426
Pete!

523
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,061
You have to stop.

524
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,534
Don't act like you care.

525
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:12,302
I gave you the plant.

526
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:14,638
Aw, because you knew it was
failing. What a bunch of crap.

527
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,542
That's what I get. I get that
my whole life! The crap!

528
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:29,953
Ah!

529
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:33,123
Not anymore.
I'm saving this town.

530
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,125
<i>I'm</i> the hero.

531
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:36,526
And you're dead.

532
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,321
Mm.

533
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,398
Colt.

534
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,133
Dusts anything.

535
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,317
Hey.

536
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,420
How you feelin'?

537
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,656
Like I just went 12 rounds
with a god.

538
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:42,259
So, you know... Normal.

539
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,694
Yeah.
You should go.

540
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,432
No, sheriff, uh,
we can help clean up.

541
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,800
No.

542
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:53,770
This... I'll take care of it.

543
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,372
It's on me.

544
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,843
This?

545
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:02,646
This is my legacy.

546
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,187
Hey.
Yep.

547
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,356
Next time you hear me say that
our family is messed up,

548
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,393
remind me that we could be
psycho goat people.

549
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:18,628
Yeah, that's true enough.

550
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,732
You know, I was...

551
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,201
Thinking about what bishop said.

552
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,937
About...

553
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,706
What do you think
our legacy's gonna be?

554
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,678
When we're gone, I mean,
after all the stuff we've done,

555
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,246
you think folks will
remember us?

556
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:38,315
You know, like,
a hundred years from now?

557
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,751
No.

558
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,486
Oh, that's nice.

559
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,988
Well, I mean...

560
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,823
Guys like us, we're not exactly
the type of people

561
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,825
they write about
in history books, you know?

562
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,460
Mm.

563
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,531
But the people we saved,

564
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,232
they're our legacy.

565
00:38:56,234 --> 00:39:00,337
And they'll remember us
and then I guess...

566
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,806
We'll eventually fade away, too.

567
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,476
That's fine,

568
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:09,646
because we left the world better
than we found it, you know.

569
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,456
I wonder what's gonna happen
to this place.

570
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:23,259
After we're gone, you think
some hunter'll move in,

571
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:26,429
keep fightin' the fight?

572
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:28,431
Yeah, I hope so.

573
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:31,368
Yeah. Me, too.

574
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:46,049
What are you doin'?

575
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,684
Leaving our mark.

576
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,066
Here.

577
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,426
Hmm.

578
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:40,670
Guess we gotta call Mick,
debrief or whatever.

579
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,772
Right.

580
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,878
<i>Hello, Winchester.</i>

581
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,513
Ketch?

582
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,048
<i>Where's Mick?</i>
Oh, he didn't tell you?

583
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,451
He flew back to London
last night.

584
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,052
<i>After all the...</i>

585
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:58,721
<i>Oh, unpleasantness
with Dagon and Renny, well...</i>

586
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,723
Mick has a lot to answer for.

587
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:03,860
So for the time being,
you'll report to me.

588
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,428
Seriously?

589
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,730
<i>I don't like it
any more than you do.</i>

590
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,699
I'd much rather be
with your mother.

591
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,100
<i>Hunting.</i>

592
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:14,103
For... Chupacabra in Texas.

593
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:17,474
<i>But for now,
I'm what you've got.</i>

594
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,542
So... Wisconsin?

595
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:22,145
We fought a god and won.
<i>Well done.</i>

596
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,814
We'll be in touch.

597
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,820
So now we're reporting
to low rent Christian bale?

598
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,822
Seriously?

599
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,093
<i>I don't like that guy.
He creeps me out.</i>

600
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:40,530
<i>Yeah.</i>

601
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:45,835
<i>And he rides the oldest, worst,</i>

602
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,504
<i>most unreliable bike.</i>
