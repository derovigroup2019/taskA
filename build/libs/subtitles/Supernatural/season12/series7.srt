1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,970
Cass is chumming it up
with Crowley.

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:05,738
They're hunting Lucifer
together.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,640
That's right...
One's an angel, one's a demon,

4
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:10,276
and apparently,
they solve crimes.

5
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:12,945
So Lucifer is now
the Master of Butt Rock.

6
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:14,280
He jumped into Vince Vincente.

7
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:16,482
The rock star? The douchebag.

8
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,217
Guy used to roll with
purple hair down to his butt

9
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,952
and a spiked codpiece.

10
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:21,454
- It was the '80s.
- What, are you defending him?

11
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:24,724
No. I mean, his third album
was kind of...

12
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:27,059
not horrible.
I hate you so much right now.

13
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,461
I've seen around all stripes
of Vince, all right?

14
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:30,196
Drunk Vince, depressed Vince,

15
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:32,498
megalomaniacal
"I'm a Golden God" Vince.

16
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,067
The Vince who threw me
through that door...

17
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,669
that wasn't him.

18
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:40,039
If you hear from him,
don't hesitate to call.

19
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,742
Okay, Agent... Beyonce©.

20
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,978
This vessel hopping's
getting old.

21
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,015
Just as I get used to
the limitations of one meatsack,

22
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:51,484
I gotta cut bait and jump
to the next flawed lump.

23
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:53,953
Then you want me to make
this vessel permanent?

24
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,288
Strong enough to hold you?

25
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,722
Does look good on me.

26
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,392
<i>Festina!</i>

27
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:07,266
Red, what did you do?

28
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,935
Sped up the decaying process,
my Lord.

29
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,537
Ginger bitch!

30
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,506
You can't destroy me!

31
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:18,044
Not yet, but I can send you
far, far away.

32
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:21,180
Try finding a new vessel at
the bottom of the bloody ocean.

33
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:23,616
<i>Abi! Aah!</i>

34
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:37,163
- Dark Lord.
- Apollyon.

35
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:38,698
Beelzebub.

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,767
As your humble servants,
we beseech thee.

37
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,603
We say your names as summonings.

38
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,105
Show thyself!

39
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,407
Serpent. Devil.

40
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,510
Lucifer! Show thyself!

41
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,313
Rain your splendor upon me.

42
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:58,784
Let me bathe
in your unholy wrath.

43
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,654
Drench me, Lucifer.

44
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:03,923
Cut it out, Gordy.

45
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,528
Dude, it's not funny.

46
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:14,066
Dude, you asked Lucifer
to drench you.

47
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:15,634
I didn't write it, okay?

48
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,470
It's a Satanist Society
of America-approved summoning.

49
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,637
I found it online.

50
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,373
Yeah, like you found
that "artifact."

51
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,942
Face it, Adam,
your "Satan feather,"

52
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:25,811
is faker than my stepmom's
Chinatown Fendi.

53
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,446
It's real. It's a rock.

54
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,782
Well, it's fossilized.
A feather from Lucifer's wing.

55
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:32,218
The seller excavated it
from one of his crypts.

56
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,819
Lucifer has "crypts."

57
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,588
Lucifer has "wings."

58
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,890
You're so frickin' dumb.

59
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,759
Actually...

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,867
I've been looking for that.

61
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:50,469
No way! No freakin'...

62
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,171
Aah!

63
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,708
Hiya.

64
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,109
You're...

65
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:58,644
I-it worked!
My summoning actually...

66
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,881
The only thing that
"summoned" me was this.

67
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,985
This vessel was already
wearing out,

68
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:09,789
and my trip under the sea
did not help.

69
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,692
With a little power up...

70
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,540
Hey.

71
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:30,576
Won't last long, but it'll do.

72
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,878
So, you and your... pal,

73
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,015
are you typical of my following
on Earth these days?

74
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:37,583
'Cause... oof.

75
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:40,119
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You can't be Lucifer.

76
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,155
<i>You're Vince Vincente.
My mom loves you.</i>

77
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,357
You're... kinda famous.

78
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:52,965
Kinda famous.

79
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,454
"Twerking." Booyah.

80
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,332
Seriously?

81
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:28,267
What?
So I've been trying to dig up info

82
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,136
on the British Men of Letters,
keeping an eye out for cases,

83
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,938
and you've been goofing off
with a game

84
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,274
that went out of style
five years ago?

85
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,476
I don't think Mom's quite ready
for Snapchat.

86
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,246
You're playing against Mom?
Yeah.

87
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:41,580
The same Mom that didn't know

88
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,249
what a cellphone was
a month ago?

89
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:45,084
Yeah.

90
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:46,685
Doesn't exactly seem like
a fair fight.

91
00:04:52,193 --> 00:04:54,793
You were saying?

92
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,697
So how she been lately?

93
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,966
She's good. You know,
she... she's dealing.

94
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:04,870
Hey, Cass.

95
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,505
<i>Hello, Dean.
You still living out</i>

96
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:09,642
<i>an '80s buddy comedy
with Crowley?</i>

97
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:11,577
Unfortunately.

98
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,912
Any news on Lucifer?

99
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:16,682
<i>Actually, yes. Look at the news.</i>

100
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,350
One sec.

101
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,659
No way.

102
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:29,061
So this is from today.

103
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,696
<i>We're here in front
of DeathSiren Records...</i>

104
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,164
<i>No friggin' way.
With Vince Vincente.</i>

105
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,432
<i>Yes, it's, it's great</i>

106
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,501
<i>having the band
back together again.</i>

107
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:36,969
<i>In the studio, feeling pumped.</i>

108
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,305
<i>Haven't felt this fired up
in ages.</i>

109
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:41,740
<i>A lot of people saying
that your style of rock</i>

110
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,009
<i>could never make a comeback
in today's landscape.</i>

111
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,744
<i>What do you say to them?</i>

112
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,782
<i>Go to hell.</i>

113
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:52,151
- Tell me that's not Lucifer.
- We don't know.

114
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:55,521
Cass, I-I thought you said
Rowena got some licks in.

115
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,923
Shouldn't he have burned through
his vessel by now?

116
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,658
Yeah, but we don't know.
We don't...

117
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,528
Hello, boys. Long time.

118
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,930
We team up to save the world,
and then bupkis.

119
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,332
You don't call, you don't write.

120
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,767
Yeah, we don't care.
Crowley... Lucifer.

121
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,869
Lucifer. Think about it.

122
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,805
Of all the extinct rock acts,

123
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:15,074
Ladyheart are
the most Paleolithic.

124
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:17,409
<i>A major label sponsored
comeback in 2016</i>

125
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,078
<i>for those dinosaurs?</i>

126
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,447
It doesn't feel like
a wholly natural

127
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:22,915
turn of events, does it?

128
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,618
Maybe Lucifer found a way
to heal his vessel.

129
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,720
Yeah, but still...
I mean, what the hell?

130
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,555
<i>He's in L.A. I'll see you there.</i>

131
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,093
Yeah.

132
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,963
Where are you going?

133
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,531
I know a guy.

134
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:05,958
Hello, Russell.

135
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,027
Brother Crowley.

136
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:11,830
One moment. Just let me
tie this off real quick.

137
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,601
All right!

138
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,137
<i>So... what brings you to</i>

139
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,240
the City of... Angels?

140
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,075
<i>You know this is my city.</i>

141
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:24,410
Ha!

142
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:25,811
What's with all this
Maharishi crap?

143
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,547
I moved to the Westside
last year.

144
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:32,251
Started daily meditation,
yoga, green juice.

145
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:36,321
Helps to keep the ego
and the anger in check.

146
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,857
<i>But enough about me.
How you been?</i>

147
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,093
Health? Family?

148
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:42,961
Hell?

149
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,131
Doesn't matter, don't care,
and been better.

150
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,100
Well, good news. Good news.

151
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:51,737
I got a couple of quality
up-and-comers for you.

152
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:55,507
Thirsty young talent.
Souls ripe for the taking.

153
00:07:57,378 --> 00:08:01,480
You have been pleased with
our... arrangement so far?

154
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,682
As punch.

155
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,084
A soul's a soul.

156
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:07,686
But there is a certain prestige

157
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,189
to owning a Swift or a Drake.

158
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:11,824
You like that?

159
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,393
It's a gift from Dre.

160
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:20,866
This whole Vince Vincente
comeback thing...

161
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,901
It's a joke, right? No.

162
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,037
Deadly serious, my friend.

163
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,106
We've raided, repackaged,
and resold

164
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:28,774
everything else from our past.

165
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,210
Why not give hair metal
another shot?

166
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,246
Yeah, okay. I doubted it, too,

167
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,516
but Vince came to me
with a killer pitch.

168
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,121
The original Ladyheart lineup
reunited.

169
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:44,923
Back in the day, those cats
sold, like, 10 mil.

170
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,725
So did Hootie & the Blowfish.

171
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,094
And I'll bring them back, too.

172
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,730
I know Ladyheart might be
a punch line,

173
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,833
but the band's got
off-the-chart name recognition.

174
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,869
And just talking to Vince,

175
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:59,772
he seemed different, you know?

176
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:02,241
Energized. Reborn.

177
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,642
Lit.

178
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,377
Like a whole new man.

179
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,246
Exactly.

180
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:19,725
All right. 450 miles to L.A.

181
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:21,960
Land of gridlock, Botox,

182
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,163
overtaxing, underachieving,

183
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:26,532
smell of sweaty desperation.

184
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,867
I mean, you can't breathe.
The beaches are toxic.

185
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:32,738
You got dudes in skinny jeans
wearing sunglasses inside.

186
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,842
Image-obsessed narcissists.

187
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:40,212
I do like the yoga pants,
though.

188
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:42,915
When was the last time
we were in L.A.?

189
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,450
About 10 years ago,
doing a vengeful spirit?

190
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:49,288
Man, that seems like
forever ago. Doesn't it?

191
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,358
Hey.

192
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,260
Tryin' to talk to you here.

193
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,862
What? You...

194
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,130
What are you listenin' to?

195
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,432
Podcast. Why?

196
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,534
All right, well...

197
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,937
I need something to
keep me awake, so crank it up.

198
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,140
I mean, it's a history podcast.

199
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:13,512
Well, I like history, you know?

200
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:16,582
Gladiators and outlaws, pirates.

201
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:19,551
Hell, we're driving
a piece of history right here.

202
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:20,819
N-not that kind of history.

203
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,654
This is a...

204
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:26,158
it's a podcast on the history
of the Protestant Reformation.

205
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,759
A multipart exploration

206
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,895
of each of Martin Luther's
95 theses.

207
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:32,854
Yeah, that's what I thought.

208
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,440
<i>Sam. Dude.</i>

209
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:43,208
<i>Hair rock? Really?</i>

210
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,643
It's not hair... Come on.

211
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,178
<i>It's not hair rock, Dean.
It's hard rock.</i>

212
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,813
It's legitimate hard rock.

213
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,257
Wow.

214
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,850
Don't judge book by its cover.

215
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:54,052
Yeah, or a dude by his,
rainbow wig and leopard prints.

216
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,121
Rainbow wig? What?

217
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,491
You know what?
I'm done apologizing.

218
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,027
Lucifer possessed
Vince Vincente.

219
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:06,098
This is Vince Vincente's music,
so listening to it is research.

220
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,233
<i>No. No. As a matter of fact...</i>

221
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,668
Study up, Dean.

222
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,538
I don't wanna listen to it.

223
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,441
You like it. No. No. No, no. No.

224
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,078
It'll grow on ya.

225
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,994
Your tweet about
Ladyheart's reunion

226
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,130
already has
over a million engagements.

227
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,899
When you were solo, you were
lucky to have 300 "likes."

228
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,467
The band's teaser track
on SoundCloud?

229
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:45,904
500K streams in 4 hours.

230
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,372
Buzzfeed just posted
a listicle...

231
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,408
"10 Things You Need to Know
About Ladyheart."

232
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,110
This is good, Vince.
This is really good.

233
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,680
Great. It's happening, Vince.

234
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:57,215
I mean, we are gonna
be famous again.

235
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:59,351
Vince.

236
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:04,690
So, we actually gonna
record or what?

237
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,929
Not really feelin' it.

238
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,965
Come on, man.

239
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,533
The band's back together.

240
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:18,537
We've got an actual
recording budget.

241
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,773
Dude... let's make some music.

242
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:26,878
Music.

243
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,247
What are the fans saying
about me right now?

244
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,883
They're tweeting about your drinks with
Pam Anderson last night,

245
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,819
speculating if you two
are rekindling.

246
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,721
And they're debating whether
Vince Vincente

247
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:38,690
is bae, nay, or daddy.

248
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,059
What the hell does that
even mean?

249
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,161
It means it's not about
the music.

250
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,896
It never really was.

251
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:48,400
You know, rock's not the reason.
It's just an excuse...

252
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:52,971
to worship, to adore.

253
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,541
See, humans have always
been desperate

254
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:59,211
to put someone
or something above them.

255
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:02,848
And let's face it,
God ain't cuttin' it these days.

256
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,850
It takes a Kim Kardashian,

257
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,619
a whatever Justin Bieber is.

258
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,921
A me.

259
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,660
They're enjoying the ride.

260
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,195
So should you.

261
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,528
What?

262
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,296
It's good.

263
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,365
<i>It's vegetable water.</i>

264
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Sam, Dean.

265
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,169
Hey.

266
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,870
You consider switching up
your duds there?

267
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,439
Bit stiff for this town.

268
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:02,007
He could be an agent
or something.

269
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,708
Yeah, maybe a third-tier agent.

270
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,677
At least I don't look like
a lumberjack.

271
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,714
Okay, enough.
Guys, where's Crowley?

272
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,484
He said he'd meet us here.

273
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,386
Frankly, I appreciate the break.

274
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:16,254
<i>It's been weeks,
and he's been right there,</i>

275
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,790
just talking and talking
and talking.

276
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,592
It's relentless.

277
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,395
Don't listen to him.

278
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,831
Feathers and I are
all but inseparable now.

279
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,666
You find anything? Yes.

280
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:30,535
Vince Vincente
is riding with the Devil.

281
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,605
Okay, so what now?

282
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,509
I suggest we go
check out his room.

283
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:39,711
Vince is scheduled to be
in the studio all day,

284
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,646
so we're covered.
How'd you get the card?

285
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,249
This is L.A.
I know a lot of people.

286
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,398
Well, looks like there
was some kind of a fight.

287
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,102
<i>Yeah. Some kind.</i>

288
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,739
Look at this.

289
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,375
Rock star biographies.
Like, all of them,

290
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,744
from Aerosmith to ZZ Top.

291
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,447
It's like he's studying
how to become famous.

292
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:20,719
Well, so what, Lucifer's a dork?

293
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,220
That's good to know.

294
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,523
Look at this... "The seeds
of a ripe dragon fruit"

295
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:27,993
"drizzled with exactly
1 ounce of Acacia honey,

296
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:31,296
prepared in a ceramic bowl...
No plastic."

297
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,165
What is this spell?

298
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:36,635
It's breakfast.
It's Vince's rider.

299
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:38,436
I've seen worse. I don't get it.

300
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,339
Lucifer could be taking over
Heaven and Hell right now,

301
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,376
and instead, he's trying to
act out some rock god fantasy?

302
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,445
Yeah. Who wouldn't?

303
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,047
I found something.

304
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,751
What is that?

305
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:54,586
It appears to be a human tooth

306
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:57,422
pulled out by the root.

307
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,666
Can I ask you something?

308
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:10,168
Why are you spending time
with me?

309
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,338
You ignored me for years,

310
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,574
not that I blamed you.

311
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,810
I was a fool

312
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:22,147
not to recognize
such sweet devotion.

313
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,389
Talk to me, Roseleen.

314
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,794
Tell me about...

315
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,295
me.

316
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,265
You're Vince.

317
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:44,135
Vince Vincente.

318
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,438
And I knew I was in love with
you the moment I saw you.

319
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,976
I was 16, just a normal kid
growing up in Arcadia.

320
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:53,578
Arcadia. Sounds beautiful.

321
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,147
I was watching
"Headbanger's Ball"

322
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,550
and the "Bloody Messiah"
video came on.

323
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:00,852
And I...

324
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:05,857
It was your voice.

325
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,994
And your hair. And your eyes.

326
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,962
It was everything.

327
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,797
<i>You were everything.</i>

328
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,500
And even when people
made fun of me...

329
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,269
Younger girls at work,

330
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,504
shredding on
my Ladyheart tattoos

331
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,072
and saying you're a joke...

332
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,908
I never stopped loving you.

333
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:28,280
And I never will.

334
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:30,749
How much do you love me?

335
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,955
What would you do to show me?

336
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,226
Anything.

337
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,934
Anything?

338
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,441
Would you bleed?

339
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,848
Then bleed.

340
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,551
Mrs. Greenfield has lost
a lot of blood

341
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:35,454
and there'll be no fixing
those scars, but she's stable.

342
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:38,491
And she cut herself?

343
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:42,461
<i>She carved his name
into her chest.</i>

344
00:18:42,463 --> 00:18:44,997
"Vince Vincente."
Didn't skip a letter.

345
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,365
And she cut deep.

346
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:47,833
Thanks, Doctor.

347
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:53,906
Well, again, what the hell?

348
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:55,875
I'll go talk to her.
No. No, no, no, you won't.

349
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:58,411
Cass, stay here.
Keep an eye on him.

350
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:05,751
Well...

351
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:08,154
together again.

352
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:10,389
Yay.

353
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:16,762
We wanna understand
what happened,

354
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:19,331
but in order for us to do that,
we need you to talk.

355
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,868
Roseleen, did Vince force you
to do this?

356
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,071
No.

357
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:26,972
Vince didn't.

358
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:29,508
He wouldn't have to.

359
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,210
I wanted to,

360
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,946
to show him, to make him happy.

361
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:36,382
You ever stop and wonder
what kind of sicko gets happy

362
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,984
off of watching somebody
melonball their own flesh?

363
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:41,020
Don't talk about Vince
like that.

364
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:45,891
He had a reason, a good reason.

365
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,660
He must have.

366
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:52,465
I'm sure he can explain
everything.

367
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,303
If I could just see him...

368
00:19:57,305 --> 00:20:00,406
I need to get to the show.

369
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,775
Please!

370
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,547
Please!

371
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:13,519
Okay, we're building an aura

372
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:16,188
of mystery and exclusivity
with tonight's show...

373
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,657
Undisclosed location,
small, select audience.

374
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:22,761
<i>It's as much about who doesn't
get a ticket as who does.</i>

375
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,197
<i>This could push
your social media profile</i>

376
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,765
to Kimye levels.

377
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,200
Who gets the tickets?

378
00:20:28,202 --> 00:20:29,935
It's an online lottery
of local fans,

379
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,004
but it'll tend towards
the Ladyheart diehards.

380
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:32,675
They'll be more engaged...

381
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,040
I've had my fill of
the diehards.

382
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,675
They already love me.

383
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:40,412
Religion, celebrity, Twitter...

384
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:42,648
It's all the same rules.

385
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,584
If you're not gaining followers,
you're losing followers.

386
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:49,388
I want a different crowd
tonight. New fans.

387
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,792
Look, getting a new audience

388
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,728
is great
for social media visibility,

389
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,130
which is great for overall buzz,

390
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,533
but they're fickle.

391
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:03,035
They don't spend any money
on music. They have no loyalty.

392
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:06,305
Good luck translating their attention
to album or ticket sales.

393
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,407
I don't care.

394
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:12,611
I want fresh blood.

395
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,321
Got it.

396
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:29,261
So the show is tonight?

397
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:30,663
That's what she said.

398
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,731
Can Lucifer even sing
or play an instrument?

399
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:35,167
I doubt they offer
Intro to Guitar in the cage.

400
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,670
Like it matters.
What Lucifer made that woman do

401
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,438
has got nothing to do
with music.

402
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,507
It's about devotion. Come again?

403
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,977
<i>You little people
wouldn't understand,</i>

404
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:46,612
but I've been a king.

405
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:49,381
Having people look at you
like you're everything,

406
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,817
knowing that once they buy in,

407
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:54,853
you can make them do anything,

408
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,355
it's intoxicating.

409
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,890
Well, that's super creepy.

410
00:21:57,892 --> 00:22:00,893
Okay, so this concert,
all these people, what is...

411
00:22:00,895 --> 00:22:03,729
What is Lucifer planning to do?
Nothing good.

412
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:07,132
Is Rowena... Dear Mother says

413
00:22:07,134 --> 00:22:10,269
that once we catch Lucifer,
she'll show, no sooner.

414
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:11,165
Well, without Rowena,
we're outgunned.

415
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:12,772
With her, we're outgunned.

416
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:16,041
It doesn't matter, guys.
This is our shot.

417
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,810
We just gotta find out
where he's playing tonight.

418
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:20,646
All right, let's get to work.

419
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:22,681
A mystery to even me.

420
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:26,318
Though, even if I did know,
I probably wouldn't tell you.

421
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,388
You'd threaten
our very lucrative partnership

422
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,993
for one over-the-hill,
bad dye job rock dinosaur?

423
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:36,362
I'm smelling money with Vince,
bruh.

424
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:39,498
This is business, Crowley.
It's nothing personal.

425
00:22:45,473 --> 00:22:49,241
No, believe me,

426
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,943
it's personal.

427
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:55,714
Tommy.

428
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:59,551
Guys, I'll meet you inside.

429
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:05,090
Agent. What are you
doing here, man?

430
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,226
Investigating Vince,
same as before.

431
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:10,663
You hear what happened
to Roseleen?

432
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:15,401
Yeah, that was, it was awful.

433
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:17,202
But, I mean, come on, man,
she cut herself, right?

434
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:17,940
It wasn't like...

435
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,910
You know that's not
the whole truth.

436
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,242
<i>You know Vince isn't Vince.</i>

437
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:31,650
We're the brothers
that rock together.

438
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:34,553
We're kind of like
the American Oasis.

439
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:37,589
Ew. But with synths.

440
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:39,367
Yeah, right, so, you know,
we're... we're hip.

441
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:40,427
Exactly.

442
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:42,795
Who plays what? I'm on keys.

443
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,163
He's on the drums. Guitar.

444
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:46,231
Drums and guitar.
I pretty much do it all.

445
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,170
We saw online that you represent
Vince Vincente.

446
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,040
We were kind of hoping you could do
for us what you've done for him.

447
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:57,543
Sorry.

448
00:23:57,545 --> 00:23:59,545
I took this meeting 'cause you
looked hot in your pics,

449
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,246
but I am not feeling this.

450
00:24:01,248 --> 00:24:03,682
Okay, you know what? We're not
actually here for a meeting.

451
00:24:03,684 --> 00:24:06,695
Vince's show tonight...
Where is it?

452
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,596
Who are you guys?

453
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:11,699
Look, you must've noticed,
Vince is different.

454
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:17,171
I... don't know!

455
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:19,273
You're messing with hellfire,
Russell.

456
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:22,343
<i>You will find out
where that show is.</i>

457
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:24,778
<i>You will tell me</i>

458
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,482
<i>or I will end you.</i>

459
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,193
Brigitta, get me another
green juice in here.

460
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:40,828
Namaste.

461
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,348
Where's the show, Tommy?

462
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,484
Man, I don't know what the hell's
going on with Vince, all right?

463
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,220
All the royalties on our hits
dried up years ago.

464
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:51,055
I got two daughters in college.

465
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:54,058
I know what I told you
and I know what I saw, but...

466
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,694
And you don't care
who pays the price?

467
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,934
Sorry.

468
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,538
Vince gives me the skeeves,
but he's a playing client.

469
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,240
No, he's the Devil.

470
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:11,409
Yeah, like, literally.

471
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:14,431
I'm in P.R.

472
00:25:14,432 --> 00:25:18,567
I've worked for sexists,
racists, even politicians.

473
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:20,836
My job is making saints
out of devils.

474
00:25:20,838 --> 00:25:22,872
No way I'm threatening
my reputation

475
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:24,807
by working against
his interests.

476
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:28,244
So you need to take a step back
or I start screaming.

477
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:31,380
And in a crowded place
like this?

478
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:34,984
Girl like me,
two guys like you...

479
00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:36,819
Guess what happens next?

480
00:25:38,022 --> 00:25:39,889
Buh-bye.

481
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:54,036
And you said you put the fear
in Russell.

482
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:56,539
I thought I had.

483
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,607
These yoga types.

484
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:00,910
Just when you think
you've harshed their mellow...

485
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:02,845
Yeah, well, I've been looking
everywhere online,

486
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:07,016
and...
no one's linked the venue yet.

487
00:26:11,522 --> 00:26:13,389
Seriously? What?

488
00:26:13,391 --> 00:26:15,925
Dude. Shut up.

489
00:26:17,729 --> 00:26:19,362
Cass.

490
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,733
Anything?

491
00:26:23,735 --> 00:26:25,034
No.

492
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:28,204
So we couldn't flip

493
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:29,705
a single member of Vince's team.

494
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:31,407
Even with the threat
of mass murder,

495
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:34,276
these SoCal douchebags
won't do the right thing.

496
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:36,112
Welcome to Los Angeles.

497
00:26:36,114 --> 00:26:37,780
So what happens now?

498
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,133
I've never seen so many
crying emojis in my life.

499
00:26:57,135 --> 00:26:58,601
The people who didn't get in,

500
00:26:58,603 --> 00:27:01,570
they're rending garments
all over Twitter.

501
00:27:01,572 --> 00:27:04,273
Gossip blogs, social media,

502
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:07,443
they're on fire speculating
about the secret reunion show.

503
00:27:07,445 --> 00:27:09,845
And the winners? Thrilled.

504
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:12,815
Be more thrilled if we had
new music to sell.

505
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:14,683
What?

506
00:27:17,488 --> 00:27:20,623
Well, Vince was a no-show
at the studio.

507
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,224
Again.

508
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:25,461
The muse...

509
00:27:25,463 --> 00:27:27,363
Guess she took a powder.

510
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:29,832
Relax, Russell.

511
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:32,468
Tonight's show?

512
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,336
It's gonna kill.

513
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:36,672
I took a chance on you, Vince.

514
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:40,776
An aging, well-past-his-prime
buttrocker.

515
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:44,046
<i>You will get in line.</i>

516
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:46,515
Or?

517
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:49,051
Or I take it all back.

518
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:50,753
Whoa.

519
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:53,456
Check your contract for it.

520
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:58,060
You don't do what I say,
I can bury Ladyheart.

521
00:27:58,062 --> 00:28:00,062
I own you.

522
00:28:00,064 --> 00:28:01,547
Do you?

523
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:03,571
Yeah.

524
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:16,345
What's happening here?

525
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:19,415
Hey, man.
Vince, what are you doing?

526
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:21,250
Hey, man.

527
00:28:21,252 --> 00:28:22,618
Hey! Vince, stop!

528
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,353
Hey! Vince!

529
00:28:26,557 --> 00:28:27,990
Hey.

530
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,839
Well...

531
00:28:45,343 --> 00:28:47,476
See you all inside.

532
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,728
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

533
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:53,415
Vince!

534
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:56,118
Vince!

535
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:12,434
Who's ready to have fun?

536
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:14,670
Vince, I love you!

537
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:17,039
Hey! Vince!

538
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,675
Thank you!

539
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:21,944
I love you, Vince! I quit.

540
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:06,504
Guys.

541
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,055
Tommy's still not answering.

542
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:43,696
Well, he got us here.
That's what matters.

543
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:47,345
Enochian handcuffs.
That's your move?

544
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,614
They held me. You're not him.

545
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,249
We have no sure bets here, okay?

546
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,384
Anything that we use is gonna
be like popping BBs.

547
00:30:53,386 --> 00:30:56,421
Great pep talk. Go, team.

548
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:58,523
Guys, we're here to do more than
just take a shot at Lucifer.

549
00:30:58,525 --> 00:30:59,028
We are?

550
00:30:59,052 --> 00:31:01,052
Yes, we need to save
the people inside, too.

551
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:04,028
I'll take Lucifer.
He's my responsibility.

552
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,964
No, he's not.
He's all of our responsibility.

553
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:08,900
Well, the only way you'll clear
that crowd without drawing fire

554
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:10,468
is if he's otherwise engaged.

555
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,670
Engaged in what, Cass?
Killing you?

556
00:31:12,672 --> 00:31:16,841
Cass, you'll last...
three minutes tops.

557
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:19,243
Then I'll buy you three minutes.

558
00:31:21,414 --> 00:31:23,147
Make it four.

559
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:27,852
What? I help.

560
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:38,830
Have you seen that crowd?

561
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:42,467
Man, I have not seen
an audience this hyped

562
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:45,648
since we headlined
Monsters of Rock in '91, man.

563
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:46,138
No.

564
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:48,473
And the girls?

565
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:50,942
Perfect age. Ooh.

566
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:52,710
Tommy?

567
00:31:52,712 --> 00:31:54,879
You okay?

568
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:58,916
Our fearless leader.

569
00:32:03,823 --> 00:32:05,923
How you feelin'
about the show, Tommy?

570
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:13,131
Yeah. Me, too.

571
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,999
The nerves.

572
00:32:18,872 --> 00:32:21,539
Whoops!

573
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:23,274
Guess I should've practiced
before tonight.

574
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:27,311
Or, you know, ever.

575
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:28,780
Who are you?

576
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,883
Who I was...
well, that doesn't matter.

577
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:34,118
<i>Who I am?</i>

578
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,588
Well, I'm Vince Vincente,
rock god.

579
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,024
And after careful deliberation,

580
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:43,027
I've decided to cut
the dead weight.

581
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,629
I'm going solo.

582
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,966
Castiel.

583
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,835
Aah!

584
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,139
Took you long enough.

585
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:58,943
Did you bring the rest
of the Little Rascals?

586
00:33:00,513 --> 00:33:02,980
Just me.

587
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:06,084
Spanky.

588
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:16,761
Sorry.

589
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:35,279
Hey, you guys...
You guys smell smoke?

590
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:38,916
One, two, three! Vince! Vince!

591
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:42,386
Did not take you
for the martyr type, Crowley.

592
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:46,991
I'm really not.
I just hate you that much.

593
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:58,536
What are you doing, Lucifer?

594
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,938
You mean nothing
to those kids out there.

595
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,508
<i>You think they'd draw blood
for you?</i>

596
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,209
By choice?

597
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,211
Well...

598
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:10,047
I thought I'd at least ask.

599
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:15,920
And if they won't give it up
by choice,

600
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:19,090
maybe I'll just take it. Why?

601
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,559
<i>Because it's fun.</i>

602
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,694
Because I can.

603
00:34:23,696 --> 00:34:25,363
And because being Lucifer?

604
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:28,966
So much Judeo-Christian baggage.

605
00:34:28,968 --> 00:34:31,869
But Vince? He's famous.

606
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:34,372
Everybody loves him.

607
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:41,379
And I need love.

608
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:44,849
I had a really jacked childhood.

609
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:47,118
Hey, Tommy.

610
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:51,689
You think this is fun?

611
00:34:51,691 --> 00:34:54,592
I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

612
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:56,527
I was inside you.

613
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:59,063
I know what a weak, duty-bound...

614
00:34:59,065 --> 00:35:03,100
pleasureless dullard you are.
Aah!

615
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:06,537
<i>And you.</i>

616
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,806
Bad doggy. Sit!

617
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:16,280
No, seriously, I-I-I think
I smell smoke, everyone.

618
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,380
Sure you're not having a stroke?

619
00:35:17,404 --> 00:35:19,284
Hey, I'm serious.
We need to get out of here.

620
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:21,211
<i>- Step off, dad.
- Hey, listen to me. We've got to go, okay?</i>

621
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:22,888
What's your
problem, man? Get off me!

622
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:25,323
We gotta... All right, yeah.
Get this guy off me!

623
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:26,521
No, listen to me, okay? Listen,
we gotta get out of here.

624
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:27,059
What's your problem, old man?

625
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,761
Okay. All right, yeah.

626
00:35:30,763 --> 00:35:33,130
Okay. Look, we gotta get
everybody out of here.

627
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:39,637
Fire!

628
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,645
Clever girls.

629
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:56,254
No. No, no, no, no, no.

630
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,066
Stick around
for the after-party.

631
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:38,398
What a crowd!

632
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,799
I love you, Vince!

633
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:44,103
Look at all those fresh,
new faces.

634
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:46,172
Everyone excited?

635
00:36:46,174 --> 00:36:48,441
Yeah, you should be!

636
00:36:48,443 --> 00:36:51,411
Tonight's not gonna be
a typical show.

637
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:55,415
Tonight, you're gonna see
and feel things

638
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:57,350
you never saw or felt before.

639
00:36:57,352 --> 00:36:58,651
Yeah!

640
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:00,987
Things might get
a little bit messy.

641
00:37:04,192 --> 00:37:05,658
Screw it.

642
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:11,197
He's got a gun!
We gotta go! We gotta go!

643
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,699
Go, go! Come on, guys!

644
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:20,707
No, no. No, no, no.

645
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:22,508
Go!

646
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,043
Go.

647
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:35,254
Nuh.

648
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:37,123
Hey, assbutt.

649
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,433
Hi, Dean.

650
00:37:50,472 --> 00:37:52,071
Sam.

651
00:37:52,073 --> 00:37:54,507
Enjoy the show?

652
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,314
Guys, you know I could
end you all

653
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:04,283
with a snap of my finger?

654
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:06,652
Why would I do that
when you can't

655
00:38:06,654 --> 00:38:09,155
do anything...

656
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:11,024
to me?

657
00:38:11,026 --> 00:38:12,959
Why are you doing this?

658
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:14,660
Why?

659
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:17,830
You and God made up.
You forgave him.

660
00:38:17,832 --> 00:38:19,365
What would he think?

661
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:23,169
I'm not especially interested
in his opinion.

662
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:26,906
Dear old dad, he finally
apologized for abandoning me.

663
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:29,876
<i>And what's the very next thing
he does?</i>

664
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:34,781
He ditches me.

665
00:38:34,783 --> 00:38:38,184
And you, too, by the way.

666
00:38:38,186 --> 00:38:42,488
And rides off into the sunset
with Auntie Amara.

667
00:38:44,526 --> 00:38:46,993
<i>He needed my help,</i>

668
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:49,996
and he'd say anything to get it.

669
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:53,800
<i>His words, your words,
they mean nothing.</i>

670
00:38:55,904 --> 00:38:59,038
<i>Don't you get it?
This is all meaningless.</i>

671
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,941
Heaven, Hell,

672
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:05,411
this world.

673
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:10,316
If it ever meant anything,
that moment is past.

674
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:15,955
Nothing down here but a bunch
of hopeless distraction addicts,

675
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:18,357
so filled with emptiness,

676
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,528
so desperate
to fill up the void...

677
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:26,532
they don't mind being served

678
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:31,204
another stale rerun
of a rerun of a rerun.

679
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:34,874
You know what my plan is?

680
00:39:34,876 --> 00:39:37,810
I don't have one.

681
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:42,315
I'm just gonna keep on smashing
Daddy's already broken toys

682
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:46,052
<i>and make you watch.</i>

683
00:39:46,054 --> 00:39:48,087
Yeah?

684
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:50,323
'Cause it kinda looks like
you're falling apart.

685
00:39:50,325 --> 00:39:53,226
Yeah, you got a little
something, right there.

686
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:56,729
I mean, face it, rock is dead.

687
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:58,798
What can I say?

688
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,368
Kicking your ass
took a lot out of me.

689
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,270
But don't worry.

690
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:06,873
Onward and upward.

691
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:34,967
How you feelin'?

692
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:37,069
I'm not dead.

693
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:38,538
Well, I gotta hand it to you.

694
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,506
You said you were gonna draw
Lucifer's fire

695
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:41,841
and you drew some serious fire.

696
00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:44,377
It was a grand success.

697
00:40:47,182 --> 00:40:49,882
Well, we didn't catch Lucifer,
but we did save the crowd,

698
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:51,617
so I'm gonna call that a win.

699
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,753
I wouldn't.

700
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:56,989
Vince Vincente is dead.

701
00:40:56,991 --> 00:40:59,358
We never even hoped to save him.

702
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,760
And, yes, I know,
the third album...

703
00:41:00,762 --> 00:41:02,962
No, he was still a person,

704
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:05,464
and he meant something
to a lot of people.

705
00:41:05,466 --> 00:41:08,534
And Lucifer just took all that
and just twisted all that up

706
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:11,270
and snuffed it out.

707
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:14,574
Lucifer was bad enough
when he had a plan, a motive.

708
00:41:14,576 --> 00:41:17,043
Now he's just having fun.

709
00:41:17,045 --> 00:41:19,345
I mean, how many people
died tonight?

710
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:23,683
Them, this, it's all on us.
We let him out.

711
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:25,618
We're not winning.

712
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,154
We're just losing slow.

713
00:41:28,156 --> 00:41:29,622
And you heard what he said.

714
00:41:29,624 --> 00:41:32,258
Onwards and upwards.
He's gone big.

715
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,460
And he'll go bigger.

716
00:41:34,462 --> 00:41:36,262
And we will stop him.

717
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:40,766
We will.

718
00:41:40,768 --> 00:41:43,769
It's what we do, man.
