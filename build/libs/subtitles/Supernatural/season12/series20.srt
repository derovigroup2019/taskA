1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,566
Dad's on a hunting trip

2
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:04,501
and he hasn't been home
in a few days.

3
00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:06,904
We could take care
of a few kitchen witches.

4
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:08,639
They get their power
from demons.

5
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,881
I mean, selling your soul
at the crossroads kind of deal?

6
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:15,077
So you guys were raised by
a witch, but you're hunters.

7
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:16,579
Yep.

8
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:18,180
Dr. Hess
wants to know everything

9
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:20,849
about our "friends"
the Winchesters --

10
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:22,618
their allies...

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,086
...their habits.

12
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:26,422
how does Sam get his hair
so shiny?

13
00:00:26,424 --> 00:00:29,024
When I saw Dagon had
captured Kelly,

14
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:30,960
I thought the angels
could help.

15
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:32,628
And?

16
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,799
Time to take this
off the board.

17
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:38,767
No!

18
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:42,738
I know now that this child

19
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,208
must be born
with all of his power.

20
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:18,173
Hello?

21
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:20,276
You have to ring
the bell.

22
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:22,478
You startled me.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,047
What a delicate constitution
you must have.

24
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:31,453
Uh, that is a lovely ring.

25
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:34,556
Ah. Yes.

26
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:36,558
And if it goes missing,

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,360
I'll know who to blame.

28
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:43,065
I could cleanse your aura
if you like.

29
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,834
Looks a little...muddy.

30
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:49,204
Mm.

31
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,510
Oh. Coming!

32
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:57,012
Sorry. Hi.

33
00:01:58,349 --> 00:01:59,948
Hi.

34
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,784
Sorry for the wait.

35
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:04,086
- Are you Tasha?
- Tasha Banes, yes.

36
00:02:04,088 --> 00:02:06,488
- I called and...
- Yes, right. I'm Andy.

37
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,290
We've got you set up
at the top of the stairs.

38
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,625
Fantastic.

39
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,360
So what brings you
to Rock River?

40
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:12,694
Business or pleasure?

41
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:15,397
Little bit of both.
Hmm.

42
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:20,469
?

43
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,677
Reveal.

44
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,312
Now.

45
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:31,980
Reveal.

46
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:33,816
Now.

47
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,350
Reveal.

48
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:47,529
?

49
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:23,732
?

50
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:33,809
Ugh.

51
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:36,245
Oh, God.

52
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:51,627
?

55
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:23,292
Okay, so last night...

56
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:27,229
that Super Mario power-up crap?

57
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:29,831
That wasn't Cass.

58
00:04:31,335 --> 00:04:33,268
That freaking baby
isn't even born yet

59
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,437
and it sock puppeted him.

60
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,805
Think about it.

61
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:40,375
Cass said that he had <i>faith</i>
in Lucifer Jr.?

62
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:42,644
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

63
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:47,249
I don't know.

64
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:50,452
I mean, look, this doesn't make
any sense to me either, Dean.

65
00:04:50,454 --> 00:04:53,655
But if we wanna have some shot
at finding Cass,

66
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,958
then we have to...

67
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,760
I don't know.
Uh, try and think like him.

68
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:00,796
How?

69
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:04,433
Seriously, I mean up until now,
if Cass messed up,

70
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:06,034
if he did something wrong,

71
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,502
but he thought it was for
the right reasons, I got it.

72
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:08,904
Right?

73
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:11,273
But last night,
when I looked at him,

74
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:14,309
I did not recognize the guy
staring back at me.

75
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:24,686
?

76
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,058
Can you fix it?

77
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:33,962
I hope so.

78
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:40,469
It's not me.
It's not me.

79
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:53,482
Must be one of Mom's.

80
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:57,953
Hello?
<i>Oh, uh...</i>

81
00:05:57,955 --> 00:06:00,288
Sam?

82
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,059
Uh, I didn't know y--
Uh, it's Alicia Banes.

83
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:06,595
Alicia?
Hey, what's going on?

84
00:06:06,597 --> 00:06:08,630
Like Max and Alicia?
Yeah.

85
00:06:08,632 --> 00:06:10,432
Yeah, sorry to, um...
Uh, Mary gave me

86
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:12,668
a couple different numbers
to reach her, and we thought --

87
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,937
<i>No.</i> No. Mnh-mnh.

88
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:18,206
<i>I thought</i> Mary would
be down to help.

89
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,275
Uh, be our backup
on this, um...

90
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:22,110
You sound crazy.

91
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:24,312
Hey, guys. It's Dean.

92
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:26,948
<i>Uh, you okay?</i>
Yeah, depends who you ask.

93
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,917
Um, Mom was hunting
this witch

94
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,253
who's killed people
all over Wyoming.

95
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:33,255
<i>Uh, anyway, Mom usually</i>

96
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:35,957
checks in with us,
but she's sort of disappeared.

97
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,293
Oh, my God.
She did not disappear.

98
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:39,628
<i>She's busy.</i>

99
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,730
Wait, so -- so your mom
<i>is</i> missing?

100
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:43,131
Where are you guys?

101
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:44,599
We're on our way
to Rock River, Wyoming.

102
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,635
But Max thinks
I'm overreacting, but I --

103
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:48,603
Because you're being dramatic.

104
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:50,872
Mom's fine.
Stop bothering them.

105
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:52,340
Fine. Okay.

106
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:54,409
<i>Hey, we'll be okay.</i>
<i>Uh, never mind.</i>

107
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:56,912
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Um...

108
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,716
Hey, why don't you text us
your address? We'll meet you.

109
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:02,250
You will?

110
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:04,119
They will what?
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

111
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:07,222
What the hell, man?
What about Cass?

112
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:08,924
Dude, Cass ditched
his cellphone.

113
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:10,992
Look, Jody put an APB out
for Cass and Kelly

114
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:12,394
across three states.

115
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:14,763
Until that
shakes something loose

116
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:16,298
or we get some other break,

117
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,733
all we're doing is --
is sitting here,

118
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:20,102
banging our heads
against a brick wall.

119
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:22,537
Let's get out there. Let's...

120
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:27,442
Their mom's on a hunting trip
and hasn't been home in a week.

121
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:35,150
All right. Let's go.

122
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:50,832
?

123
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:07,516
Please be a dear
and shut that bloody thing off.

124
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:10,850
It's Dean.

125
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,388
And?

126
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,025
<i>This is Mary. Leave a message.</i>

127
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:18,593
Mom.

128
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:20,529
Hey, uh, just wanted
to let you know that, uh,

129
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:23,498
me and Sam, we're uh,
we're heading out on a case

130
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,835
with those witch twins,
uh, Max and Alicia.

131
00:08:26,837 --> 00:08:30,639
Um, I'll text you the info,
but, uh...

132
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:33,975
I know the Brits have got you
running nonstop.

133
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:36,244
So if you can help out,
that'd be great.

134
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:39,281
Um...

135
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:41,917
And even if you can't swing by,

136
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,785
can you call me back?

137
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:46,988
Just some stuff
going down that's...

138
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,057
kind of got me spun out.

139
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:54,229
Be good to talk to you.

140
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:03,538
I suppose it amuses
you to take Mary's form,

141
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,274
or perhaps you believe
it will inspire

142
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:09,110
a bit of hesitation
on my part.

143
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:17,152
It will not.

144
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:23,925
Aah!

145
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:27,028
Aah!

146
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:32,234
He's not gonna talk.

147
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:36,938
The <i>shifter</i> has killed <i>people,</i>
Mary.

148
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,274
This is the very beginning
of what <i>it</i> deserves.

149
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:41,977
And if <i>it</i> tells us where
its family is,

150
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:45,247
well, then this will
all stop.

151
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,283
Promise.

152
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:56,324
That eye of yours twitches
when you lie.

153
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:59,160
My eye twitches all the time.

154
00:10:05,402 --> 00:10:07,903
Well, then,

155
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:11,006
I guess I know all about you.

156
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:12,974
Hmm.

157
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:20,515
Hey, guys.

158
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:21,917
Hey.

159
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,319
All right, well, we're here.
What do you got?

160
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:26,755
Our mom was after
a "borrower" witch.

161
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:28,823
So witch that gets their power
from a demon deal.

162
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:29,842
Mm-hmm.

163
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:31,627
Okay, so you tracked
your mom here?

164
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:32,794
And now we tracked her

165
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:34,262
to the only vegan restaurant
in town.

166
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:36,064
They told us where
she was staying.

167
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,000
Anything else?

168
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:40,769
I got the bartender's
phone number.

169
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:43,638
Ignore him.

170
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:47,008
Dean...

171
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,211
that car is still major.

172
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:51,680
You want the tour?

173
00:10:51,682 --> 00:10:53,748
Definitely.
Come on.

174
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,686
Yeah.

175
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,387
Max isn't really
feelin' this.

176
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:01,323
Yeah, I hadn't noticed.

177
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:02,924
He always thinks he knows
Mom better,

178
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:04,960
but it's 'cause they're both
natural witches.

179
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:06,761
It's who they are.

180
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,167
Whoa.

181
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:13,802
Right?

182
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:15,303
Nice.
Yeah.

183
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:17,138
Is that a grenade launcher?
Yes, she is.

184
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,376
Yeah, but, uh, this is what
we need right now.

185
00:11:21,378 --> 00:11:22,911
Witch killing bullets.

186
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:25,580
And what about you?
Uh, with magic.

187
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:27,849
Nah, I don't have it.

188
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:30,618
It's just kind of
a lot of noise to me.

189
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,155
Magic is definitely
their thing, you know?

190
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:36,024
Yeah.

191
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:37,826
When I was growing up,
Dean and my dad

192
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:40,729
had the same thing
with hunting, that bond.

193
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:42,397
What about with Mary?

194
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:45,767
I mean, she, uh,

195
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:49,537
she gets into a case
and just sort of vanishes.

196
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:51,940
Yeah.
No, Mary's a great hunter.

197
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,775
Yeah.

198
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:56,845
Uh, she doesn't seem like
much of a hugger.

199
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:59,547
Yeah.

200
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:03,351
Hey.

201
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:06,821
Let's go find your mom.

202
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:16,865
Well, her car's here.

203
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,366
Well, no one's trying
to hide it. That's good news.

204
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:20,568
Yeah.

205
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,975
?

206
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:30,445
Not weird. At all.

207
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:37,218
All right, look, anything happens,
you guys stay behind us.

208
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,687
Yeah. Sure.

209
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:41,823
Alicia...

210
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:46,795
Uh, hi.
Hey.

211
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:48,396
Can I help you?

212
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:49,998
Yes, please. We're, uh,
we're looking for, uh --

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,500
Max? Alicia?

214
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:54,602
What are you two doing here?

215
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,809
?

216
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:05,955
Mom!

217
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:11,261
Sam and Dean Winchester,
meet the great Tasha Banes.

218
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:13,730
The kids have told me
very nice things.

219
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:17,433
Alicia basically made them come
just in case you were in peril.

220
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:19,068
Well, that was unnecessary,

221
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,004
but very nice of you
all the same.

222
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:22,472
Andy, can we get
a couple rooms

223
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:24,040
for my children
and their friends?

224
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,441
Sure. It'll just be a minute.

225
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:27,877
Great. You can wait in my room.

226
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,913
I have wine.

227
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,614
Great.

228
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:34,484
Wine.

229
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:38,021
So Rock River's a dead end.
No witches here, unfortunately.

230
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:39,455
Thought this was the place --

231
00:13:39,457 --> 00:13:40,990
Well, then why didn't you
call us?

232
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:43,126
I mean, we --
Ahem.

233
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:46,529
<i>I</i> called and texted a lot.

234
00:13:46,531 --> 00:13:50,700
I'm sorry, baby. My phone
hasn't been charging all day.

235
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:54,671
Oh, but I did find
a fantastic acupuncturist.

236
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:56,439
Of course you did.
Of course you did.

237
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:58,541
You want me to help with that?

238
00:13:58,543 --> 00:14:00,109
Oh, I've got it.
No, but you always call

239
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:02,412
on the fourth day of a hunt,
no matter what.

240
00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:04,147
Honestly, babe, it just
slipped my --

241
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:09,385
Mom? You okay?

242
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,020
I'm fine.

243
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:12,422
Sam, do the honors.

244
00:14:12,424 --> 00:14:14,824
Of course.
Alicia, put some music on.

245
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:21,130
<i>?</i>

246
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:29,339
Oh.

247
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:31,207
I ordered food
from that vegan place,

248
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:32,842
but no deliveries.

249
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:34,243
Oh, I can get it.
Oh, I'll grab it.

250
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:36,012
Uh, you guys stay,
hang out, catch up.

251
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:38,414
Dean...drink.

252
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,750
Yes.

253
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:52,662
I must say, I am pumping
with adrenaline.

254
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:55,631
Perhaps we could find some
privacy and tire ourselves out.

255
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,367
It's not
illicit motel sex, but --

256
00:14:57,369 --> 00:15:00,269
I remember us agreeing
that was a onetime thing.

257
00:15:00,271 --> 00:15:03,139
Did we? Ah, well.

258
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:05,641
Ketch, it was a waste of time,
that little torture session.

259
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:08,311
Oh, you mean the information
gathering session?

260
00:15:08,313 --> 00:15:10,013
Yeah, but we didn't get
any Intel.

261
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:13,017
That shifter was never gonna
betray his family,

262
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:14,484
and still you --

263
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,886
Sometimes pain works.
Sometimes it doesn't.

264
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:20,790
But anyone who tells you that
torture is never the answer,

265
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,892
they haven't been under
the knife.

266
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:25,695
But you enjoyed it,
because <i>that...</i>

267
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:27,730
I have never seen that side
of you.

268
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:29,866
Yes, well, Mary, I'm sad to say
that you won't become

269
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:34,103
the Jiminy Cricket of
the British Men of Letters.

270
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:37,473
We don't need a conscious.

271
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:40,043
Such a trite idea,
but we firmly believe

272
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:43,312
the ends do justify
the means.

273
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:44,714
They didn't this time.

274
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:46,949
Ah, but look,
you're still with us.

275
00:15:49,854 --> 00:15:52,655
Feel free to call
Mick Davies.

276
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:55,058
Have him write me up.

277
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,960
Well, Mick's not answering
his phone.

278
00:15:57,962 --> 00:15:59,662
And his e-mails have stopped.

279
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:01,697
I'm sure he's busy.

280
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:03,466
When you get called to London
by the old men,

281
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:07,670
it's not all pints of stout
and trips to Savile Row.

282
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:12,575
Oh, and you should probably
return Dean's call.

283
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:16,379
Wouldn't want him to think
Mummy doesn't love him.

284
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:20,450
?

285
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:30,460
Expecting a call?
Oh.

286
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:32,161
Alicia...

287
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:34,764
Guess not.
...let's say later, I...

288
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:37,066
hypothetically
might need your Jeep

289
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:38,695
to take it out
for maybe a little cruise.

290
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:39,636
Mm, let's not.

291
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:40,354
You know, I gotta say,

292
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:41,565
you did a bang up job
with those two.

293
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:44,707
You must be drunk.

294
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:46,109
Off of wine?

295
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:48,478
Not fair.
Yeah.

296
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,514
I did the best I could
for Max and Alicia.

297
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:53,816
No.
I got lucky.

298
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:56,652
I see how you are with them,
all right? It's good.

299
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:59,355
You know, they're --
they're happy.

300
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,760
Alicia said you grew up
in the life.

301
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:09,532
Yeah. Yeah, my dad raised
me and Sam to hunt.

302
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:11,501
And your mother?

303
00:17:13,104 --> 00:17:14,637
That's complicated.

304
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:17,006
Yeah. <i>Yeah.</i>

305
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:19,275
Family's always complicated.

306
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:24,780
Parents always seem smart
and strong and perfect.

307
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,849
It's only when you grow up
that you realize

308
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:29,452
that they're just people.

309
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,823
...love your brother?

310
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:37,093
?

311
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,966
<i>And even if you can't</i>
<i>swing by,</i>

312
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:46,035
<i>can you call me back?</i>

313
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:49,038
<i>Just some stuff going down</i>
<i>that's...</i>

314
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,374
<i>kind of got me spun out.</i>

315
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:56,579
<i>Be good to talk to you.</i>

316
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,853
Well, I can't just send him
to you economy comfort,

317
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:06,022
now can I?

318
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:09,125
The package is
in the armory now.

319
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:10,660
We gave it a lot number.

320
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:14,630
1-2-2-5-7. Mm-hmm.

321
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:19,302
We'll speak when you get in.

322
00:18:19,304 --> 00:18:21,571
Tra.

323
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,977
?

324
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:32,114
Hi.

325
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:36,686
You've made yourself
at home.

326
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:38,254
Uh...

327
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:40,456
Can I help you
with something?

328
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,960
I use Mick's computer
for e-mail.

329
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:49,365
Uh, uh, yeah, well,
have at it.

330
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:57,707
?

331
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:13,356
There's a message from Mick.

332
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:17,393
He says he's gonna be stuck
in London a few more weeks.

333
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:19,128
Hmm.

334
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,998
Well...there you are.

335
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:30,801
- Hey.
- Oh!

336
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,065
Food!
Ooh!

337
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,399
Oh! Who's hungry?
Me!

338
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:35,367
Oh, my goodness. Thank you.
All right.

339
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:37,708
Ooh, it smells so good.
All right, let's see what we've got.

340
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,075
- Here, I can set up over here. Okay.
- Hey.

341
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,477
We'll be right back, y'all.
Sure.

342
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:44,914
Ah, you two. Get it --
get it down. Grab some napkins.

343
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,016
I know that look. What's up?

344
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:50,286
This was posted outside
the restaurant.

345
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:52,388
That guy we saw earlier,
coming out of the cellar?

346
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,290
He's been missing
for a month.

347
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:56,359
Okay, that's weird.

348
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,961
Well, maybe Tasha's wrong.
Maybe there is something going on here.

349
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:02,765
Yeah. I'll let 'em know.
No, no, no. Let's...

350
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,433
We can handle it. Come on.

351
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,635
Hmm.

352
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:42,772
?

353
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,016
<i>This is Dean's</i>
<i>other</i> other <i>cell,</i>

354
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:53,819
<i>so you must know what to do.</i>

355
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:56,855
Hey. It's me.

356
00:20:56,857 --> 00:21:00,559
Sorry I couldn't pick up before.
I've been on a hunt with Ketch.

357
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:04,229
And, Dean...

358
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:08,467
I'm sorry I haven't been there
for you and Sam.

359
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:11,003
But I wanna be.

360
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:12,838
I <i>will</i> be.

361
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,008
I just...

362
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,343
I need to finish this.

363
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:22,414
I miss you boys.

364
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,883
I love you.

365
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:29,154
...she made me get out of the car...

366
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:30,889
She did not.
...to make a phone call in the rain.

367
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:33,759
Oh, my God. Alicia.
He just got out to yell at me.

368
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,475
Ugh.
Smells like death.

369
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,344
Yeah.

370
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:53,812
Go ahead.

371
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,447
What? You.

372
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:57,215
All right.

373
00:21:57,451 --> 00:22:00,886
?

374
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:03,375
Alicia...
Was it that serious?

375
00:22:03,377 --> 00:22:06,178
Oh, man.

376
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,647
Ladies, I'm gonna leave
you alone now

377
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:10,616
to have some girl time.

378
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:12,651
Since when are you not
a part of girl time?

379
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:16,221
Since I've got a date
with that hot bartender

380
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:18,257
from that vegan restaurant.

381
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:20,792
We're gonna have some...
guy time.

382
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:22,928
Hey, don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

383
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,063
Right. Right.

384
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:28,600
And what exactly was that?

385
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,204
Max!

386
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:38,377
?

387
00:22:42,683 --> 00:22:44,049
Sam.

388
00:22:49,256 --> 00:22:50,956
Ugh.

389
00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:56,295
Dean.

390
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:05,837
?

391
00:23:07,074 --> 00:23:09,675
Son of a bitch.

392
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:13,912
Her heart's been ripped out.
So have theirs.

393
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,984
Wait, this is everybody
that's in the house.

394
00:23:18,986 --> 00:23:21,219
Okay, well, if this is
the real Tasha,

395
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,755
then who the hell
was I talking to up there?

396
00:23:29,463 --> 00:23:31,596
Hey.

397
00:23:31,598 --> 00:23:34,099
Hey, Max. Uh...

398
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:36,435
I saw the light. You guys find
some trouble to get into?

399
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:39,638
Nah. No, no. We -- we --
we just, uh...

400
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,180
I just...

401
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:55,053
?

402
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:13,772
I just...

403
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:37,596
?

404
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:56,248
Ohh.

405
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:04,256
Mick.

406
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:18,303
?

407
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:34,253
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

408
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:03,648
What the...

409
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,225
<i>So now we're reporting</i>
<i>to low-rent Christian Bale?</i>

410
00:26:13,227 --> 00:26:15,427
<i>Seriously?</i>

411
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:17,362
<i>I don't like that guy.</i>
<i>He creeps me out.</i>

412
00:26:17,364 --> 00:26:19,698
<i>This is Dean's</i>
<i>other</i> other <i>cell,</i>

413
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,766
<i>so you must know what to do.</i>

414
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:24,336
Dean, call me.

415
00:26:24,338 --> 00:26:26,838
We've got a problem.

416
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:34,079
Hello, Mary.

417
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:36,348
Your handprint doesn't open
this room

418
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,283
because it's not for you.

419
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:40,785
What are you doing here?

420
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:44,022
Why is Mick's body in a box?

421
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:47,993
An unfortunate
werewolf mishap.

422
00:26:47,995 --> 00:26:50,362
A werewolf

423
00:26:50,364 --> 00:26:52,764
shot him in the head?

424
00:26:52,766 --> 00:26:54,366
It's not impossible.

425
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:58,203
You're a psychopath.

426
00:26:58,205 --> 00:27:00,138
Mary.

427
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:05,010
Did <i>you</i> kill him?

428
00:27:05,012 --> 00:27:07,946
Mick was weak.
He wasn't one of us.

429
00:27:14,922 --> 00:27:18,423
When will you realize that
we will do whatever it takes

430
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:21,826
to rid this world of the things
that go bump in the night?

431
00:27:23,797 --> 00:27:27,999
Something that people like Mick
and your sons

432
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:29,834
are incapable of.

433
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:33,939
Uhh!

434
00:27:33,941 --> 00:27:35,674
Aah!

435
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,646
Don't talk about my boys.

436
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:43,915
Why not?

437
00:27:50,157 --> 00:27:52,891
I've been cleaning up
after them for months.

438
00:27:54,261 --> 00:27:55,694
I took care
of those federal agents

439
00:27:55,696 --> 00:27:57,295
they stupidly allowed
to live.

440
00:27:57,297 --> 00:28:01,766
I killed a psychic girl
they thought was...human.

441
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:06,705
Honestly, they're damn sloppy.

442
00:28:06,707 --> 00:28:10,408
I think you mean...

443
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,877
decent.

444
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,714
It's the end
for the American Hunters.

445
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:17,849
Their time has passed.

446
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:21,820
But I can keep you safe.

447
00:28:21,822 --> 00:28:24,322
If you just play your part,

448
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:27,592
if you play nice...

449
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:34,232
I don't play nice.

450
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:37,302
Aah!

451
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:41,640
Are we done?

452
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:49,280
Those Enochian brass knuckles
only work on angels.

453
00:28:49,282 --> 00:28:51,650
And sadly, I'm not an --

454
00:28:51,652 --> 00:28:53,918
Aah!

455
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,888
Brass knuckles
are brass knuckles.

456
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,190
Uhh! Oh!

457
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:02,827
Oh, you bitch!

458
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:10,502
?

459
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:14,945
- No, I think he's really --
- Who are you?

460
00:29:14,947 --> 00:29:17,181
Max?
What did you do to my mom?

461
00:29:17,183 --> 00:29:18,749
Max! What are you --
Wait, wait, wait.

462
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:20,284
Tell me!
What are you doing?

463
00:29:20,286 --> 00:29:21,585
Let her go!
That's not your mom.

464
00:29:21,587 --> 00:29:23,287
- What?
- Shh.

465
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:24,855
What are you talking -- Mom!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

466
00:29:24,857 --> 00:29:27,324
It's okay.
Max, what is wrong, sweetie?

467
00:29:27,326 --> 00:29:30,088
Don't! Don't.
You are not my mom.

468
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:30,488
Max --

469
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:31,870
I don't know what kind
of thing you are,

470
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:34,164
but you are <i>not</i> my mom.
Ow!

471
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,499
Max! Stop!

472
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:38,435
Reveal. Now!

473
00:29:38,437 --> 00:29:40,070
Reveal!

474
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:45,476
The...the room,
end of the hall.

475
00:29:45,478 --> 00:29:47,144
Top of the stairs.

476
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,249
Magic.

477
00:29:56,322 --> 00:29:59,223
Got him.

478
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:13,537
Max!

479
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:19,009
Mom!

480
00:30:20,346 --> 00:30:22,046
Really?

481
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:24,882
People are trying to sleep.

482
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:26,550
All right, lady,
craft time's over.

483
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,190
Mom! Mom!

484
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:37,761
Sam, this magic,
what is this?

485
00:30:37,763 --> 00:30:39,530
I don't know. I don't know.

486
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:43,534
Oh.

487
00:30:43,536 --> 00:30:45,869
How lucky am I?

488
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:50,074
Such an impressive witch.

489
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:54,011
Maybe you'll take the deal
the last bitch wouldn't.

490
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:59,850
?

491
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:14,331
My mother...you killed her.

492
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,700
Did I?

493
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:18,769
What did you do
to those people?

494
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:21,372
Oh. Let me show you.

495
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:30,714
I'm reaching the end
of my very long life,

496
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:33,984
and it's a problem 
'cause I sold my soul for power.

497
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:36,954
So when I pass,
my soul goes to Hell.

498
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:41,358
Unless I can find someone
to take the burden,

499
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,128
to take my magic.

500
00:31:45,698 --> 00:31:47,498
Sam!

501
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,932
Mom! Mom!

502
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:50,668
When your mother found me,

503
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,370
and when I realized
what she was,

504
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:56,306
I offered to teach her.

505
00:31:56,308 --> 00:31:58,776
I offered her my power.

506
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:06,283
But even dying,
she was rude.

507
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,590
So...

508
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:17,094
I made her into one of
my creatures.

509
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,845
That doll has all of
your mother's memories.

510
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:52,730
It's her. Mostly.

511
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:54,965
Just like the others.

512
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:59,403
Rick, Andy -- they do what
I want, when I want.

513
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:02,606
I'm old.
I like things a certain way.

514
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:04,174
No.

515
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:06,009
No!

516
00:33:13,486 --> 00:33:15,652
Nice try.

517
00:33:15,654 --> 00:33:18,322
If you kill me,

518
00:33:18,324 --> 00:33:22,025
well, then all of them
just fall apart.

519
00:33:22,027 --> 00:33:25,729
So here's the offer.

520
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:28,132
You take my power.

521
00:33:28,134 --> 00:33:32,469
You take my burden,
and my doll -- your mother --

522
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:36,006
will stay with you
and your sister forever.

523
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:39,910
Just one big happy family.

524
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:42,312
Max, no. Listen to me.

525
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:43,881
Your mother is gone, okay?

526
00:33:43,883 --> 00:33:45,716
It's awful and it sucks...

527
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:47,351
...but that's -- Aah!

528
00:33:48,888 --> 00:33:51,588
So...

529
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,257
do we have a deal?

530
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:12,042
You okay?

531
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:13,977
Mom!

532
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,484
No!

533
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:29,059
Take it...

534
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:31,228
and the deal is done.

535
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:40,938
Take it.

536
00:34:56,522 --> 00:34:59,923
?

537
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:12,402
Alicia. Hey. Hey.

538
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:15,439
Hey, hold on. Just -- just
take it easy. Take it easy.

539
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:17,140
We're gonna get you
some help.

540
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:20,944
Why did you...
Max, listen to me. Hey, hey.

541
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:23,547
I had to, okay?

542
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:26,149
That deal wasn't with her.
It was with a demon.

543
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:28,852
You even touch that magic,
you lose your soul.

544
00:35:28,854 --> 00:35:30,554
Dean!

545
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:35,092
Come on.

546
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:39,529
Don't fight. Don't -- Shh, shh.
Just take it easy, okay?

547
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:43,066
Take a breath. Shh.

548
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:45,903
Alicia?

549
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,976
She, uh...

550
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:58,315
Alicia?

551
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:03,553
What? Please.

552
00:36:03,555 --> 00:36:05,255
No, no, no.

553
00:36:05,257 --> 00:36:07,724
Hey. Hey.

554
00:36:07,726 --> 00:36:09,793
Hey!

555
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:12,462
Please, no. No, no, no!

556
00:36:25,985 --> 00:36:29,720
Hey, Max, um, this is, uh...

557
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,524
Look, you -- you're probably
in shock right now,

558
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:35,426
but it's gonna pass.

559
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:37,361
And then it's gonna hurt.

560
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,833
I could've saved them...

561
00:36:42,835 --> 00:36:44,068
My mom.

562
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,137
If I had just...

563
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:49,540
taken Alicia seriously.

564
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,242
Come on, man,
you can't think like that.

565
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:54,211
Just stop talking.

566
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,113
Please.

567
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:01,452
Sure.

568
00:37:01,454 --> 00:37:04,121
We'll, uh, go get some supplies.

569
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:05,456
We have to, uh --

570
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,124
We gotta burn
the bodies, Max.

571
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:11,262
Like my dad.

572
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,267
I can do it.

573
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:18,269
I...

574
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:21,205
I should do it.

575
00:37:21,207 --> 00:37:22,873
You two get out of here.

576
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:25,042
Max, we would --

577
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:27,177
Please.

578
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:29,780
Please just...

579
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:35,986
?

580
00:37:46,499 --> 00:37:49,867
You did the right thing.
You saved him.

581
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:51,902
Yeah.

582
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:54,271
Yeah, he seemed
super saved.

583
00:37:57,176 --> 00:38:00,844
You know, I was watching them,
this loving family.

584
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:04,081
The kind we should've had.

585
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,850
And now just like that,
it's gone.

586
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:11,322
<i>Dean, you couldn't let Max</i>

587
00:38:11,324 --> 00:38:14,024
<i>make some deal for his soul.</i>

588
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:16,460
<i>Sam, we do terrible things</i>
<i>all the time</i>

589
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:18,329
<i>to save each other.</i>

590
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:20,097
<i>I mean, that's what you do</i>
<i>for family.</i>

591
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,066
<i>Who am I to stop him?</i>

592
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:23,701
?

593
00:38:23,703 --> 00:38:26,637
<i>Well, he's strong.</i>
<i>He'll be all right.</i>

594
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:31,008
<i>Yeah, I'm not so sure.</i>

595
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,244
? Oh, them old hollows ?

596
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,447
? Hide the dark secrets ?

597
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,782
?

598
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:43,520
What happened? I feel...

599
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:46,890
Ugh, I feel
like I drank too much tequila.

600
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:50,427
?

601
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:53,797
What...w-what did you do?
What...

602
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:55,899
Are you hurt?
No, no, no, no. I-I...

603
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,701
I'll explain everything.

604
00:38:57,703 --> 00:39:00,170
But we gotta go now. Okay?

605
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:01,839
Okay.

606
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:07,478
? Oh, them old hollows ?

607
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,813
? Hide the dark secrets ?

608
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:13,117
?

609
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:19,456
?

610
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,092
? Tell what they've seen ?

611
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:24,928
? You'd never sleep again ?

612
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:29,833
? In peaceful dreams ?

613
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:48,018
<i>Hey, it's me. Sorry I</i>
<i>couldn't pick up before.</i>

614
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,187
<i>I've been on a hunt with Ketch.</i>

615
00:39:50,189 --> 00:39:53,123
<i>I'm sorry I haven't been there</i>
<i>for you and Sam,</i>

616
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,625
<i>but I wanna be.</i>

617
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:56,193
<i>I</i> will <i>be.</i>

618
00:39:56,195 --> 00:39:59,730
<i>I just...I need to finish this.</i>

619
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:01,765
<i>I miss you boys.</i>

620
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,901
<i>I love you.</i>

621
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:10,107
<i>Dean, call me.</i>

622
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:12,109
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

623
00:40:15,214 --> 00:40:19,783
Sam? Hey, it's Mom.
Something's wrong.

624
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:21,285
Sam!

625
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:34,331
Good of you to rejoin me.

626
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:37,568
A Taser?

627
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,970
Not really a fair fight.

628
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:45,642
If only you'd been
as ruthless as I hoped,

629
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:49,079
this could have worked out.

630
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:51,982
Remember, Mary,

631
00:40:51,984 --> 00:40:54,251
I gave you a chance.

632
00:40:57,957 --> 00:41:01,492
So now what?

633
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:03,660
You kill me?

634
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:17,007
Don't be silly.

635
00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:18,976
You're an asset.

636
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:22,312
We have other plans for you.

637
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:25,582
Now, Mary...

638
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:28,852
?

639
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:32,689
Let's begin.
