If I might --

726
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,166
These Hunters
are out of control.

727
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:34,204
The brothers Winchester,
in particular,

728
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:37,073
which Lady Bevell has
exhaustedly documented.

729
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:38,808
Ma'am, if -- if you could
just listen --

730
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,344
To what? More excuses?

731
00:37:42,948 --> 00:37:44,914
No.

732
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,850
I don't think I will.

733
00:37:49,721 --> 00:37:55,125
Hunters are dogs,
Mr. Davies.

734
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:59,095
You give them an order,
and they obey.

735
00:37:59,097 --> 00:38:01,965
That's how it works.

736
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:04,367
So tell me, do they?

737
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:06,002
Do they obey you?

738
00:38:09,174 --> 00:38:11,241
No.

739
00:38:11,243 --> 00:38:13,610
Of course not.

740
00:38:15,947 --> 00:38:17,981
So...

741
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:22,318
this Eileen Leahy
will be found and killed

742
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,188
in accordance with the Code.

743
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,056
As for the Winchesters,

744
00:38:27,058 --> 00:38:29,425
like any rebellious Hunter,
they will be investigated.

745
00:38:29,427 --> 00:38:32,595
And, if found guilty,
executed.

746
00:38:32,597 --> 00:38:35,165
“If”?

747
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:37,233
If they're found guilty?

748
00:38:37,235 --> 00:38:39,335
Aren't Hunters always
found guilty?

749
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:41,838
Be careful, Mr. Davies.

750
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,506
No.

751
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:49,212
My entire life
with the Men of Letters,

752
00:38:49,214 --> 00:38:51,414
I never broke a rule.

753
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:56,085
And yes, at first I was shocked
at how Sam and Dean operate.

754
00:38:56,087 --> 00:38:58,488
But what Lady Bevell
doesn't mention

755
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,223
is the lives they've saved,

756
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:02,659
monsters destroyed,

757
00:39:02,661 --> 00:39:05,061
and outcomes made better
not because of the Code,

758
00:39:05,063 --> 00:39:08,698
but because of Sam and Dean Winchester's
sense of what's right.

759
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,568
And that is the crux
of the matter.

760
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,703
The Code is not a suggestion.

761
00:39:13,705 --> 00:39:15,438
It's an absolute.

762
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,174
The Code is what separates us
from the monsters.

763
00:39:18,176 --> 00:39:21,010
It is the order
by which we all live.

764
00:39:22,347 --> 00:39:24,013
No.

765
00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:29,052
The code is what makes
a young boy

766
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:31,120
kill his best friend.

767
00:39:32,757 --> 00:39:35,625
When I was a child,
I had nothing.

768
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:39,262
I owed you everything,
and I obeyed.

769
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:43,233
But I'm a man now, Dr. Hess,

770
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:45,902
and I can see the choices,

771
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:48,571
and I choose to do
the right thing.

Hey, you, uh, you hear anything
from Cass yet?

777
00:40:12,297 --> 00:40:15,431
Mm. No. Still MIA.

00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,433
You think he's all right?

[ Breathes deeply ]

I don't know.

Where's Eileen?

782
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:26,175
She took off.

783
00:40:26,177 --> 00:40:28,511
Uh, said she's heading back
to Ireland for a while.

784
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:29,946
Just needs some time,
I guess.

785
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:31,748
Mm.

786
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,416
Yeah, I get that.

787
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:36,252
Mm.

It's over.
