with all of his power.

722
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,525
You can't actually mean that.

723
00:39:56,527 --> 00:40:00,495
Yes. I do. I have faith.

724
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:04,432
?

725
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:08,270
We have to go.

726
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:12,607
Hey, Cass, wait a second.
Wait, hold on. Just...

727
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:14,709
You have to just trust me.

728
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:17,112
No, no, no, wait. Okay,
whatever that thing did to you,

729
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,914
we're not just gonna let you
walk away.

730
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,449
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Yes, it is.

732
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,554
Don't. [ Inhales sharply ]

733
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:29,791
I'm sorry.

734
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:40,969
?

735
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,416
[ Exhales sharply ]

736
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,151
What did he tell you?

737
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,886
He didn't tell me.

738
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:01,056
He<i> showed</i> me.

739
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,757
The future.

740
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,204
