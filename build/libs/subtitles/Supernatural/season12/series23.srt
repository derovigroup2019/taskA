1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,506
Did you know people tell
stories about us?

2
00:00:02,584 --> 00:00:05,017
Yeah. Apparently,
we're a little bit legendary.

3
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:08,354
? Carry on, my wayward son ?

4
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:12,702
? There'll be peace when
you are done ?

5
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:13,937
Pew.

6
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:16,840
? Lay your weary head to rest ?

7
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:20,010
? Don't you cry no more ?

8
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:22,512
?

9
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:26,950
- Let's begin.
- Mom?

10
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:28,563
I have
sort of been working

11
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:29,831
with the British Men of Letters.

12
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,332
I know how much
you hate them.

13
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:35,403
No, <i>we</i> hate them.
<i>Us.</i> Together.

14
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:36,905
Lucifer is back.

15
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:40,742
? Once I rose above
the noise and confusion ?

16
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:43,578
? Just to get a glimpse beyond
this illusion ?

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,946
Crowley's dead,

18
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:47,582
and the Devil
is out looking for his son.

19
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:48,883
A nephilim is come into being.

20
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:51,453
I can feel it. I'm its mother.

21
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,823
? Though my eyes could see ?

22
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:56,791
My baby's not evil.

23
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:58,326
? Though my mind could think ?

24
00:00:58,328 --> 00:01:00,495
He showed me the future.

25
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:02,697
How?
I have faith...

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,632
Don't.
...in this child.

27
00:01:04,634 --> 00:01:08,369
? I can hear them say ?

28
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,271
? Carry on, my wayward son ?

29
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:12,106
She <i>will</i> shoot you.

30
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:15,543
? There'll be peace when
you are done ?

31
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:17,645
? Lay your weary head to rest ?

32
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:19,814
Mary.

33
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:22,951
? Don't you cry no more ?

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,829
?

35
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:47,875
God, please.

36
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:49,977
I need help.

37
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:53,247
<i>I'm trying to help you, ma'am.</i>

38
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:55,483
<i>Are</i> you, Sven?

39
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:58,419
Because if you ask me if I have
the quarter-inch Allen wrench

40
00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:01,589
one -- one more time,
I am going to come down there

41
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:04,492
and burn your giant
Viking junkyard of a store

42
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:07,695
to the ground!
Do you understand?!

43
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:09,597
<i>Are you sure it wasn't</i>
<i>in the box?</i>

44
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,900
God!

45
00:02:12,902 --> 00:02:15,102
Kelly.

46
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:18,205
I told you
I'd put this together.

47
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:19,974
I'm very good
at following instructions.

48
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:22,810
And you need to rest.
No, I don't.

49
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:26,180
Kelly --
No, Cass, I don't.

50
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,784
I can't.

51
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:33,187
I don't know how long until...

52
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,591
I don't know how long
I have left.

53
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:41,896
And I...I'm never gonna be able
to teach him how to ride a bike

54
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:44,899
or watch him get married

55
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:48,702
or even
look him in the eyes.

56
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,972
But I can
build him a stupid Swedish crib!

57
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:54,208
I can do that.

58
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:59,914
Kelly, I know
how hard this is.

59
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:05,886
That's a lie.

60
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:11,225
I have no idea how hard
this is for you.

61
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:16,831
But I promise you...

62
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,433
I will do everything.

63
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:21,836
I will give my life
for your son.

64
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:26,273
And I will raise him.

65
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:30,811
And I will make him
someone you will be proud of.

66
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:38,385
I know.

67
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,390
Okay, let me just
get this straight.

68
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:46,293
So...
we beat the Brits,

69
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:49,363
we kicked their psycho,
tea-swilling asses,

70
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:52,299
and instead of popping champagne
and headin' to Vegas,

71
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:54,602
we get Lucifer.
And you're sure it's him?

72
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:56,604
Yeah.
That's his old vessel, too.

73
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:58,639
How is that possible?
Crowley, I guess.

74
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:00,207
And now <i>he's</i> dead.

75
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,542
Well, that's what Hess said.

76
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:03,511
But Crowley's
a freakin' cockroach.

77
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:07,214
I'll believe he's gone
when I see the body and burn it.

78
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:10,284
<i>This is gonna hurt.</i>

79
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:16,790
?

80
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,749
?

81
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,894
We don't need Crowley.
We need Rowena.

82
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:56,697
I mean, she's the one who can
slam Lucifer back into the Cage.

83
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,066
Great. So where is she?

84
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:21,589
Oh, hey, Sammy.

88
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:35,335
<i>Oh, if you're</i>
<i>looking for Rowena,</i>

89
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:38,272
<i>she is presently indisposed.</i>

90
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:40,441
<i>Which is a delicate way</i>
<i>of saying,</i>

91
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:43,343
I stomped on her face
till the white meat showed,

92
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:45,712
and then set her on fire,
just in case.

93
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:50,584
<i>Ah. Gingers.</i>

94
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:53,520
It was messy and...

95
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:56,256
screamy,
but it had to be done, Sam.

96
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:58,859
I'm about to be a dad.

97
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:02,229
Can't raise the little nipper
from a jail cell now, can I?

98
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:06,033
Speaking of...

99
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:08,202
you know where
your little pal Castiel is?

100
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:10,370
Go to hell.

101
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:13,440
Ooh! Good one. Witty.
I'll use that in the future.

102
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,142
<i>All right, well,</i>

103
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:17,578
<i>I'd love to chat with ya,</i>
<i>but, uh,</i>

104
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,547
why waste my time, right?

105
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:22,182
<i>It's not like you matter.</i>

106
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:25,419
I don't need to put on
the old Sam suit anymore, do I?

107
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:27,187
You know, if you think we're
just gonna let you walk --

108
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:29,723
Oh, hey, Dean!
Y--

109
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:31,792
I know you fellas are gonna try,
you know, whatever.

110
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:33,227
Whatever you're gonna try.

111
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,795
<i>But you can't kill me.</i>

112
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:36,697
<i>You've never been able</i>
<i>to kill me.</i>

113
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:39,366
<i>And with, uh, witch bitch gone,</i>
<i>you can't put me</i>

114
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:42,336
back in the Cage,
so like I said...

115
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:44,004
you don't matter.

116
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:45,506
<i>Okay?</i>

117
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:49,510
Buh-bye. Buh-bye.

118
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:52,746
Bye, dear.

119
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,546
I'm just saying,

120
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:28,248
the checkout guy looked at us
like we were super weird.

121
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,350
Ah, you'll get used to it.

122
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:34,454
Okay, but...Cass, I mean,
you went a little overboard.

123
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:37,291
I disagree.

124
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:40,227
I have read 74 books
on child rearing,

125
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:43,797
and there is one thing that
they all agree on --

126
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:46,166
everybody poops.

127
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:50,270
Well, you're not wrong.

128
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:55,175
I'm fine. I'm...

129
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:57,744
I'm fine.

130
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:19,132
You know, Lucifer's right.

131
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:23,003
We can't kill him and we can't
slam his ass back in the Cage.

132
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:27,174
Yeah. Okay. So maybe
we play for time.

133
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:31,545
Find Cass and Kelly,
keep 'em moving.

134
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:35,616
If Lucifer can't find them,
he can't hurt them.

135
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:37,517
You think Castiel is
gonna go along with that?

136
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,519
You think we'll give him
a choice?

137
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:42,756
?

138
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,126
And the baby?

139
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:48,795
Hopefully, we can still
siphon off its grace.

140
00:08:48,797 --> 00:08:51,298
If not, uh...
we'll figure something else out.

141
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,567
Yeah, we better.

142
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:55,369
All right, then.

143
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:03,610
Kind of always wanted
to punch the Devil in the face.

144
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:05,846
So how do we find them?

145
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:08,081
All right, look, we know Kelly's
gonna have that kid soon.

146
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,517
Like, really soon.
And according to the lore,

147
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,387
whenever a nephilim is born,
there are signs.

148
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,489
Uh, storms,
outbreaks of disease,

149
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:17,724
uh, plague of locusts.
Things get Biblical.

150
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:20,027
Exactly. That much power
into the world,

151
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:22,663
whenever and wherever
it happens,

152
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:25,165
things get weird.

153
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:30,170
So we're looking
for something...weird.

154
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:34,074
?

155
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:35,742
Yeah. Story of our lives.

156
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:07,107
Where...

157
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:10,844
How...

158
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:46,046
You?

159
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,857
Hi, Jack. It's, uh...

160
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,095
I'm your mom.

161
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,900
I know you're gonna be okay.

162
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,035
You are gonna be...

163
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,604
amazing.

164
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,907
You have an angel
watching over you.

165
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,916
God, I love you, Jack.

166
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,020
I love you so much.

167
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,357
Sorry.

168
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,562
I love you.

169
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,937
?

170
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:05,088
Oh.

171
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,623
Hey, listen to this --

172
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,392
two-headed calf was born
in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho.

173
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,626
That's weird.

174
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,129
That <i>is</i> weird.

175
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,698
Yeah, but not our kind of weird.

176
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,867
Look, whatever this thing
is gonna be,

177
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,303
it -- it's gonna be big
and bad --

178
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,538
You rang?

179
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,973
Hello, boys.

180
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:28,111
Did you do it?

181
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:29,479
Did you let Lucifer out?!

182
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:31,748
I didn't “let” --
Don't!

183
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,151
Moose,
a little help here!

184
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,452
Dean, wait.

185
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,920
Seriously?
Seriously?

186
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,089
Look, just don't kill him.

187
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,192
He worked the Cage spell with
Rowena. Maybe he can help us.

188
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,296
And what if he can't?
Well, then we kill him.

189
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,007
Cage spell?

190
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,742
Thought you had mother for that.

191
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,143
Rowena's dead.

192
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,745
Really?

193
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,447
Yeah, really.

194
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,615
Lucifer.

195
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,584
Funny.

196
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,120
I always thought
I'd be the one to kill her.

197
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,623
Crowley...why did you do it?

198
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,926
Save Lucifer --
What did you want?

199
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,162
I wanted to win.

200
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,766
I perverted mother's spell,

201
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,635
put Lucifer in a vessel
of my own making

202
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:29,005
because <i>I</i> wanted to win.

203
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,575
You have any idea
how many people

204
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,678
have made a play for my throne
over the years?

205
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,513
Lucifer, Abaddon,

206
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,981
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

207
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,983
Too damn many.

208
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,420
I thought if I could put
the Devil on a leash...

209
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,723
my own personal nuke,

210
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,592
no one would ever dare
challenge me again.

211
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,594
Yeah.
That worked out great.

212
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,463
All ended with
me narrowly escaping death

213
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,198
by hiding in a rat.

214
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,033
Wait.

215
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,870
In an...actual rat?

216
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,972
Wasn't too bad, really.

217
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,774
Gave me time to think.

218
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:10,781
You know, I've been focused
for so long on keeping my job.

219
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,351
Never realized I hate it.

220
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,790
All those whining demons,

221
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:24,027
the <i>endless moan</i>
of damned souls,

222
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,495
the paperwork!

223
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,197
I mean, who wants that?

224
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,099
You.

225
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,702
Unh-unh. Once, maybe.

226
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:36,139
So why are you here?

227
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:40,844
Well, whenever there's
a world-ending crisis at hand,

228
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,779
I know where to place my bets.

229
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,247
It's on you,

230
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,917
you big, beautiful,

231
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,720
lumbering piles of flannel.

232
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:56,359
So if you'll forgive
my transgression,

233
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,962
I'll make it worth your while.

234
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,564
Which means?

235
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,901
After we put Lucifer
back in his cage --

236
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,470
together --

237
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,171
I'll seal the gates of Hell.

238
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,840
You'll never see
another demon again,

239
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,576
apart from, of course,
yours truly.

240
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,544
You would do that?

241
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,480
Why not?
They stab me in the back,

242
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,615
I'll happily stab them
in the front, the sides,

243
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,284
and right up their little
black-eyed asses.

244
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,955
So...

245
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,590
we have a deal?

246
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,665
?

247
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,003
Cass?

248
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,110
Cass?

249
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,956
Castiel?

250
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:14,471
Kelly.

251
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,373
Where were you?

252
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,808
I, um...

253
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,377
uh, nowhere.

254
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,047
Um, is everything okay?

255
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,550
No.

256
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,852
The baby, it's...

257
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,854
I think it's time.

258
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,563
Oh, my God.

259
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,064
Look at me.
Oh, God.

260
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,100
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Ooh.

261
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,851
This is what you do when
I'm not here?

262
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:04,721
Type?

263
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,189
Yep.

264
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,958
Wait a second. I got something.

265
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,559
Okay, two hours ago, there was
a massive power outage

266
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,961
in the Pacific Northwest.

267
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,529
Sounds like
the right kind of weird.

268
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,464
Oh, yeah. Wait.

269
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,900
They tracked the outage
to an address

270
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,668
in North Cove, Washington,

271
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,705
to a house
currently being rented

272
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,874
by one James Novak.

273
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:27,711
That's Cass. Let's roll.

274
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,080
It's about time.

275
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,848
Aah!

276
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,851
Think we're gonna trust you
out there after what you pulled?

277
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,286
Hmm?

278
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,422
No. You stay here,
you sit down, and you shut up.

279
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:43,460
?

280
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,141
You're all right.

281
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,414
The pressure waves are still
very far apart.

282
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,083
“Pressure waves”?

283
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:08,985
It's what they --

284
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:12,522
it's what they called
contractions in my doula class.

285
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,760
I-I took it online.

286
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:23,366
First-time mothers,
labor can be 12 to 18 hours,

287
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,101
sometimes longer.

288
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,636
It...

289
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,606
Although, given this is
the child of Lucifer

290
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,742
and a quasi-celestial being...

291
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,778
They didn't cover that
online?

292
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,113
They did not.

293
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,773
?

294
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,975
Cass?

295
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,980
Thank you.

296
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:15,852
For everything.

297
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,488
Of course.

298
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:26,429
?

299
00:19:36,698 --> 00:19:38,130
Kelly.

300
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:39,999
Tell me again.

301
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:43,402
Tell me again what you saw.

302
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:46,772
Right, I saw -- I saw...

303
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:49,408
I saw the future.

304
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:53,446
?

305
00:19:58,152 --> 00:20:01,888
I saw a world without pain

306
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,924
or hunger or want.

307
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:09,362
I saw the world
that this child...

308
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:12,265
that your child...
Mm.

309
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:13,900
...will create.

310
00:20:13,902 --> 00:20:16,536
Mm.
And it is a world

311
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:19,705
without fear
and without suffering

312
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:21,240
and without hate.

313
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:24,076
Mm.

314
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:26,379
I saw paradise.

315
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:40,760
?

316
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:53,172
?

317
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,745
Dean?

318
00:20:59,747 --> 00:21:02,014
Cass,
is this place warded?

319
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:04,283
Yes, heavily.
Heavy enough to stop Lucifer?

320
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:06,285
<i>Lucifer?</i>

321
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:08,654
He could be right behind us.

322
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:11,724
I don't...
What are you doing here?

323
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:13,292
Saving your ass.

324
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:15,561
Look, you and Kelly just
taking off was a stupid move.

325
00:21:15,563 --> 00:21:18,331
But there's no way we're letting
Lucifer get his hands on that kid.

326
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,032
It ain't happening.

327
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:22,835
Look, Sam's right, okay?

328
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:24,837
We'll work through our crap.
We always do.

329
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:27,573
But right now, we are here
to get you, get Kelly, and get gone.

330
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:29,842
She can't be moved.
She's having a --

331
00:21:32,513 --> 00:21:34,380
I'll check on her.

332
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:41,988
How much time do we have?
We don't know.

333
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,991
Hey, if he shows,
can you flame on again?

334
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,427
Can you torch Lucifer
like you did Dagon?

335
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:50,763
I don't know. No, that
wasn't me. That was the child.

336
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:53,499
And in case you haven't noticed,
he's a little busy.

337
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:56,636
Son of a bitch.

338
00:21:58,673 --> 00:22:01,007
Here, Dean.
Mm.

339
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,475
Let me.

340
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,814
Thanks.

341
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:10,616
All right, we should
double-check the warding.

342
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:12,451
Wait.

343
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:15,655
Right. So listen, if we, uh...

344
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:19,592
Cass? What is that?

345
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:24,897
It's a tear
in space and time.

346
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:26,832
Uh, and that means?

347
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:29,402
It's a doorway to another world.

348
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:31,170
Anoth-- What, like Narnia?

349
00:22:31,172 --> 00:22:33,739
No. No, through there
it's Earth,

350
00:22:33,741 --> 00:22:35,141
but...but different.

351
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:37,376
It's a --
it's an alternate reality.

352
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:39,478
So it's a Bizarro world?

353
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,947
Or -- or like the place we got
zapped to where we were, uh,

354
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:43,916
uh, actors on a TV show.
Oh, yeah.

355
00:22:43,918 --> 00:22:45,518
The supernatural wasn't real.
Yeah.

356
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,720
And you were Polish.
R-right.

357
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:54,794
Wait, Cass,
how did this get here?

358
00:22:54,796 --> 00:22:56,896
Well, the child being born,

359
00:22:56,898 --> 00:22:59,131
his power,
it seems to be puncturing

360
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:01,133
the fabric of our universe.

361
00:23:01,135 --> 00:23:02,735
Awesome.

362
00:23:02,737 --> 00:23:04,603
Yeah.

363
00:23:04,605 --> 00:23:08,641
And what exactly is on
the other side?

364
00:23:09,544 --> 00:23:12,044
You don't wanna know.

365
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:13,879
Probably.

366
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,781
But we need to.

367
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:20,953
?

368
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:33,032
Whoa.

369
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:36,202
Cass, what is this?

370
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:38,904
As I said, it's -- it's Earth.

371
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:41,373
But this Earth is
locked in eternal war

372
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,042
between Heaven and Hell.

373
00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:45,377
There are armies of angels
fighting hoards of demons,

374
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:49,949
and the few humans that remain
are caught in between.

375
00:23:49,951 --> 00:23:53,152
How do you know that?

376
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:54,553
A friend told me.

377
00:23:54,555 --> 00:23:58,324
Oh, good. Now you're makin'
friends? That's...

378
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:01,060
All right, on a scale
of 1 to 10, how bad is this?

379
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:02,928
I don't know.

380
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,197
I gotta say, a, uh,
hole in reality

381
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:08,300
to a bombed out
Apocalypse world?

382
00:24:08,302 --> 00:24:09,735
I'm gonna go with 11.

383
00:24:09,737 --> 00:24:11,604
Sounds right.

384
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:14,607
You don't have to worry.

385
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:18,344
The child, he opened this door.
He'll close it.

386
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:19,845
You sure about that?

387
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:21,347
I have faith.

388
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:24,250
Really?
In your unborn baby-God?

389
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:26,852
Yes.
Well, then, you're a dumbass.

390
00:24:28,222 --> 00:24:30,956
?

391
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,358
Guys. Guys!

392
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:38,964
Hey! Hands in the air!
No. Don't.

393
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:56,215
Bobby?

394
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:02,755
?

395
00:25:04,258 --> 00:25:06,224
Do I know you?

396
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:09,261
Bobby...

397
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:11,963
Sam. Dean. Cass.

398
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:14,199
Uh-huh.
You say that like

399
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:17,836
it's supposed to mean something
to me, but...naw.

400
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:20,639
Sam, this is Bobby,

401
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:22,073
but it's your B--

402
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:24,943
Bobby, it's us.

403
00:25:24,945 --> 00:25:26,478
Sam and Dean Winchester.

404
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,148
The only Winchester
I ever heard of was John.

405
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,517
Yeah.
John Winchester, our father.

406
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:35,120
Doubt it. He's dead.

407
00:25:35,122 --> 00:25:38,089
Been dead over 40 years now.

408
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:41,893
Only reason I know about him
is this Hunter I ran with,

409
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:43,728
Mary Campbell.

410
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,697
You get a few pints of shine
into her,

411
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:47,532
and she always told
the same story

412
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:51,470
about the man she loved --
John Winchester.

413
00:25:52,873 --> 00:25:55,140
Azazel killed her
about 10 years ago.

414
00:25:55,142 --> 00:25:57,442
Cass, what the hell is this?

415
00:25:57,444 --> 00:26:00,011
This is a world
where you were never born.

416
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:05,984
It's a world you never saved.

417
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,060
Aah!

418
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:19,631
Okay.

419
00:26:21,635 --> 00:26:24,803
I think they're less than
five minutes apart now.

420
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:26,304
It's almost time.

421
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:33,178
How you doin'?

422
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,880
I'm dying.

423
00:26:37,451 --> 00:26:39,050
I know.

424
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:44,489
?

425
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,227
But that's okay.

426
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:51,830
'Cause wouldn't you die
for your sons?

427
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,203
Yeah.

428
00:27:01,808 --> 00:27:05,644
When this...
whatever opened up,

429
00:27:05,646 --> 00:27:09,881
all sorts'a alarms went off
back at my place.

430
00:27:11,184 --> 00:27:12,717
I got here just in time

431
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:15,053
to see your boy get ambushed
by a tempter demon.

432
00:27:15,055 --> 00:27:16,621
A what?

433
00:27:16,623 --> 00:27:18,023
It's, um...

434
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:20,058
black eyes, pointed teeth,

435
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,426
horns.

436
00:27:21,428 --> 00:27:23,662
Wait a second.
Demons have horns now?

437
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:25,530
Whole new world, Sam.

438
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:28,333
Usually I gun down flyboys
on sight.

439
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:32,137
But, uh, he looked...

440
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:33,872
different.

441
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:37,542
Wasn't wearing a necklace made
out of baby ears, for one thing.

442
00:27:37,544 --> 00:27:39,744
We got to talking about
where I came from

443
00:27:39,746 --> 00:27:41,746
and our two worlds.

444
00:27:41,748 --> 00:27:44,482
From what he says,

445
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:47,252
pretty much peaches and cream
on your side.

446
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:50,355
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

447
00:27:50,357 --> 00:27:51,856
It's better than this.

448
00:27:51,858 --> 00:27:53,325
Well, I don't know.

449
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:55,927
Ain't so bad here,
if you like killing angels.

450
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:58,063
And you do?

451
00:27:58,065 --> 00:28:00,098
It's my hobby

452
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,134
and my passion.

453
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:06,071
So...I figured,
it's only a matter of time

454
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:09,107
before the dicks upstairs
get wind'a this.

455
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:12,143
And when they show...

456
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:13,845
me and Rufus go to work.

457
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:17,382
He's loaded
with a hundred rounds,

458
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:19,751
cast from old angel blades.

459
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:23,321
Wait, angel-killing bullets?

460
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:26,658
Awesome.

461
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,305
Okay. Okay.

462
00:28:40,307 --> 00:28:42,941
You're okay.

463
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,580
Are you all right?

464
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:51,650
No, Cass.

465
00:28:51,652 --> 00:28:53,451
Pretty far from all right.

466
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:56,154
I mean, we've got Lucifer
on this side,

467
00:28:56,156 --> 00:28:59,024
we've got Mad Max World
on that side.

468
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:00,659
I mean, yeah, we've been
down before, but this?

469
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:02,394
I-I mean, I don't even know
where to start.

470
00:29:02,396 --> 00:29:04,229
Oh, come on!

471
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:06,498
Hello, boys. Again.

472
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,433
Wait a second,
how the hell did you --

473
00:29:08,435 --> 00:29:09,934
I improvised.

474
00:29:09,936 --> 00:29:11,302
Lucky I did.

475
00:29:11,304 --> 00:29:14,773
Turns out I'm the answer
to all your problems.

476
00:29:16,877 --> 00:29:20,111
?

477
00:29:28,622 --> 00:29:30,588
May I speak with her?

478
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,624
Sure.

479
00:29:33,894 --> 00:29:36,194
Mary.

480
00:29:36,196 --> 00:29:38,830
I'll be back.

481
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:41,399
Okay.

482
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:51,843
Cass...

483
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:53,244
what's wrong?

484
00:29:53,246 --> 00:29:56,481
?

485
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,221
You ready?

486
00:30:03,223 --> 00:30:05,123
Nope.

487
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,192
When has that ever stopped us?

488
00:30:07,194 --> 00:30:08,827
Yeah.

489
00:30:10,564 --> 00:30:13,765
You know, Cass has faith in this kid.
Mm.

490
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:17,135
I hope he's right.

491
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:18,670
But me?

492
00:30:18,672 --> 00:30:20,638
I have faith in <i>us.</i>

493
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,809
You, me, Mom, Cass.

494
00:30:24,811 --> 00:30:27,178
And Crowley. Sometimes.

495
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,913
Mm.

496
00:30:28,915 --> 00:30:30,982
This is gonna work.

497
00:30:30,984 --> 00:30:33,585
It has to.

498
00:30:33,587 --> 00:30:36,588
Don't worry.

499
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,556
It will be fine.

500
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:49,367
Remember -- paradise,.

501
00:30:59,746 --> 00:31:03,915
Well...
this is a fun surprise.

502
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,951
?

503
00:31:06,953 --> 00:31:09,220
I gotta hand it to you guys.

504
00:31:09,222 --> 00:31:12,590
You never give up,
even when you should.

505
00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:15,326
Even when it would be
so stupid not to.

506
00:31:15,328 --> 00:31:17,562
Look, whatever you're
planning on doing,

507
00:31:17,564 --> 00:31:20,965
Chuck...God will stop you,

508
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:22,801
just like he did last time.

509
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:24,469
You're right.

510
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:27,438
What should I do?

511
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,575
Oh, God!
Don't strike me dead!

512
00:31:30,577 --> 00:31:32,110
Come on, Sam.

513
00:31:32,112 --> 00:31:35,146
You sound like a virgin
in Jesus camp.

514
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:37,916
“We can't. God is watching.”

515
00:31:40,053 --> 00:31:42,720
No. Chuck “walked.”

516
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:44,522
He's gone.

517
00:31:44,524 --> 00:31:46,891
So you're just gonna
smash his toys?

518
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:48,626
Exactly.

519
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:52,063
'Cause every time I look at this
sad trash fire of a world,

520
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:54,399
you know what
I keep thinking?

521
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:56,434
I could do so much better.

522
00:31:56,436 --> 00:32:00,138
So Apocalypse, take two.
That's your plan?

523
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,806
When in doubt,
go with the classics.

524
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:04,609
That's what I always say.

525
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:08,546
Well, boys,

526
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:10,915
enough with the foreplay.

527
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:12,884
Let's do this.

528
00:32:14,054 --> 00:32:17,322
See you on
the other side, boys.

529
00:32:18,358 --> 00:32:20,024
Aah!

530
00:32:23,396 --> 00:32:25,630
Well, that worked.

531
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:32,604
Mature.

532
00:32:32,606 --> 00:32:34,405
Real mature!

533
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:36,341
You guys?

534
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:38,910
I really want to enjoy this.

535
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,213
Really wanna savor
just ripping you apart,

536
00:32:42,215 --> 00:32:45,950
gettin' all up in there,
and gettin' all gooey.

537
00:32:45,952 --> 00:32:48,987
But, you know,
little slugger's almost here

538
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:50,688
and, uh...

539
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,424
Well, I'm on the clock.

540
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:58,263
?

541
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:02,600
Interesting.

542
00:33:04,437 --> 00:33:06,938
Mm.

543
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,440
Nice.

544
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:21,219
You wanted the Apocalypse?

545
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:22,654
You got it.

546
00:33:22,656 --> 00:33:24,055
Sammy.

547
00:33:24,057 --> 00:33:27,025
Hey.

548
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:28,693
Where's your big bro?

549
00:33:28,695 --> 00:33:31,729
Right here.

550
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,532
Ooh. Sweet toy.

551
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:39,203
Yeah, I got it off an old --
new pal of mine.

552
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:40,939
See, we have this bet,

553
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:43,241
see if it works against
an archangel.

554
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:45,310
So...

555
00:33:45,312 --> 00:33:48,212
say hello
to my little friend.

556
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,687
Took you long enough.
Not now, Crowley. Come on.

557
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:58,222
Yeah, baby!

558
00:33:58,224 --> 00:34:00,591
Come on!
Uhh!

559
00:34:00,593 --> 00:34:02,226
?

560
00:34:11,705 --> 00:34:13,404
We do this ritual,
we seal that rift,

561
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:15,139
and we lock the Devil
in this godforsaken place.

562
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:16,774
That's the plan, remember?

563
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:20,178
Two birds, one spell.
Right, right. Just hurry.

564
00:34:20,914 --> 00:34:23,982
You lose.

565
00:34:37,497 --> 00:34:39,764
Uh, Dead Sea brine,
uh, mercury,

566
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:41,299
lambs blood, holy oil.

567
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:42,834
Here we go.

568
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:51,275
That's the last of it.
That's everything.

569
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:52,877
No, it's not.
What?

570
00:34:56,282 --> 00:34:58,182
If we wanna seal that rip,

571
00:34:58,184 --> 00:35:00,718
we need one more
minor ingredient.

572
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,054
-What?
- A life.

573
00:35:08,828 --> 00:35:11,963
Ah, I could do this all day.

574
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,298
You make such funny noises.

575
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:22,473
Surprise.

576
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:26,210
Crowley!

577
00:35:31,151 --> 00:35:34,652
You sneaky little...

578
00:35:35,822 --> 00:35:38,556
So I guess I get to kill you
twice, huh, Crowley?

579
00:35:38,558 --> 00:35:40,525
I doubt it.

580
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:42,126
Oh, no, no.
You had your chance.

581
00:35:42,128 --> 00:35:45,163
You could've put me
back in the Cage, but...

582
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:47,565
you had to make it personal,
didn't you?

583
00:35:49,502 --> 00:35:51,502
You're right.

584
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:53,371
It is personal.

585
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,340
You humiliated me.

586
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:58,843
I...

587
00:35:58,845 --> 00:36:02,180
I hate you. Deeply.

588
00:36:02,182 --> 00:36:04,148
Truly.

589
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,516
I'm gonna enjoy wiping

590
00:36:05,518 --> 00:36:10,388
that smug, self-satisfied look
off your face.

591
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,356
Personally.

592
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:15,059
You mean...this one?

593
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,833
Come on, Crowley.

594
00:36:21,835 --> 00:36:25,103
You know whatever you try,
you're gonna lose.

595
00:36:33,046 --> 00:36:34,645
You're right.

596
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:42,987
Bye, boys.

597
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:01,973
Cass?

598
00:37:01,975 --> 00:37:03,574
No, come on. Come on!
Cass!

599
00:37:04,377 --> 00:37:04,942
Cass! Cass!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

600
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:06,277
We gotta go! We gotta go!

601
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:21,726
I love you.

602
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:26,364
?

603
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,965
Cass.

604
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:49,039
No!

605
00:37:58,384 --> 00:38:01,251
That was fun.

606
00:38:01,253 --> 00:38:04,355
Seriously, guys,
points for trying.

607
00:38:04,357 --> 00:38:07,624
Super impressed, but, uh...

608
00:38:07,626 --> 00:38:09,293
playtime's over.

609
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:11,562
?

610
00:38:11,564 --> 00:38:13,197
Get away from them.

611
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:18,402
Mary, right?

612
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,771
Yeah, I've heard about you.

613
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:24,708
You, uh, are certainly
living up to the hype.

614
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,714
Look, seriously, I just wanted
to say thank you for everything.

615
00:38:30,716 --> 00:38:32,516
I owe ya, kid.

616
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,219
Mom, Mom, Mom.

617
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:36,887
I love you.

618
00:38:40,993 --> 00:38:43,527
?

619
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,229
Cute.

620
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:48,532
Is that all you got, mama?

621
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,147
Mom!

622
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:04,681
Aah!

623
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:07,017
- Mom, Mom! No!
- No! No!

624
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,290
No, no! No!

625
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:15,392
No!

626
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,702
No.

627
00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:27,538
No, no, no, no, no.

628
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,541
?

629
00:39:49,795 --> 00:39:53,030
?

630
00:40:37,443 --> 00:40:40,677
?

631
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:57,828
?
