1
00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:06,676
I'm sorry. Who the hell are you?

2
00:00:06,776 --> 00:00:09,810
Arthur Ketch.
British Men of Letters.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,980
Was that a grenade launcher?

4
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:12,852
Quite.

5
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:14,622
We're eager to collaborate.

6
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:17,758
But you haven't exactly seen us
at our best.

7
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,395
She tried to kill us.

8
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:24,665
And all you wanna do is help
these American hunters

9
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,867
to clear this country
of monsters?

10
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:29,604
We can offer
expertise, weaponry.

11
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:32,206
The toys are the fun part.

12
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:41,749
So you're gonna pop Lucifer
out of the President with that?

13
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:46,254
We know you're pregnant.

14
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:49,724
This is not a baby.
This is the spawn of Lucifer.

15
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:51,726
I can't do it. I'm its mother.

16
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:54,929
Let me paint you a picture of
a world where no one has to die

17
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:56,964
because of the supernatural.

18
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:58,532
I'm listening.

19
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:16,751
So...

20
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:24,258
Tell me a story.

21
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:32,967
Mandy. That short for Amanda?

22
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:34,802
Duh.

23
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:37,305
Yeah, I'll... I'll go with
the cheeseburger.

24
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:38,606
Yeah.

25
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:39,843
Hey, what's the,
Wi-Fi password here?

26
00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:40,436
Extra cheese.

27
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,460
No, no. Just, as it is, is fine.

28
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:44,512
That's the password.
“Extra cheese.”

29
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:46,080
You know what? That sounds good.

30
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:47,581
I'm gonna change mine
to a cheeseburger as well.

31
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,450
Extra cheese.
I wanna carbo-load.

32
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,185
Cheese isn't a carb.
Cheese isn't a carbohydrate.

33
00:01:51,187 --> 00:01:53,587
Mnh. Well...

34
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:55,356
Order up.

35
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:57,692
Steak and eggs. Bloody.

36
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,297
And how 'bout you, handsome?

37
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,333
What?

38
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,968
Um...

39
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,238
Sunrise Special, please.

40
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,909
Nice.

41
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:16,777
Dude, she is into you.

42
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:18,546
Dean...

43
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:19,980
No, this is good. We've been
looking for teachable moments.

44
00:02:19,982 --> 00:02:22,316
This...

45
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:27,788
Everything all right, Mom?

46
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,223
Yeah, just a hunter,
needs some help.

47
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:30,791
Another one?

48
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:33,828
Can't have too many friends
in this line of work.

49
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,530
Okay... The Internet here sucks.

50
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,499
I downloaded all the bunker's
files to a new archive,

51
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:39,896
but we're not getting
any signal, so I'm j...

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,769
Nobody cares.

53
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,971
Cass, here's the thing you need
to know about waitresses, okay?

54
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:46,774
They get hit on all day long,
so you gotta bring you A-game.

55
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:49,043
But upside?
They always smell like food.

56
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,644
They always smell like food.

57
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:52,580
- Okay... Okay...
- Why is upside they smell like food?

58
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:53,561
Right? It's great.

59
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:55,050
Why would you want them
to smell like food?

60
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,318
Hey!

61
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,920
Screens down, eyes up, shut up.

62
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:01,689
- Sorry, Mom.
Sorry.

63
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,324
Okay, here's what we know.

64
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:05,760
Our target keeps
a tight schedule.

65
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:07,261
He leaves every day at 8:00 p.m.

66
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:09,797
He gets back exactly at 8:45.

67
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,600
What's he doin'? Night fishing.

68
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:14,034
Wait a minute,
you called us to...

69
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:16,270
To kill a demon
that likes to fish?

70
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:18,672
Yes, I did. Look, guys,
this is all new to me.

71
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,174
All right,
you got a rugaru problem?

72
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:22,676
Hey, I'm your guy. But demons?

73
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:24,845
Hell. Look, I was
just passing through

74
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:27,114
and I heard about
some cattle mutilations.

75
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:28,749
Classic demon sign.

76
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,317
I started to dig.

77
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,853
A lot of virgins go missing
around here, too.

78
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:34,555
Classic horny demon sign.

79
00:03:34,557 --> 00:03:37,324
Which is why Wally called us,
asking for help.

80
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:39,393
So are we all clear on the plan?

81
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,100
Incoming.

82
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:50,070
Hey, Mandy? Question for you.

83
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:53,207
My shy but devastatingly
handsome friend here

84
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,976
was, just wondering,

85
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:57,845
when do you get off?

86
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:00,047
Whenever I can.

87
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,515
- Hey-O!
-  Zing.

88
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,784
Point 1 for her.
Just dropped that on the table.

89
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,553
- Right in front of all of us, too.
Ooh-hoo!

90
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:08,189
Wow. All right, Internet's up.
We're in business.

91
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:09,690
I'm so nervous,

92
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,292
I don't even know if I can eat.

93
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,027
Everything's gonna be fine.

94
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:21,969
Where's Sam and Dean?

95
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:36,550
No! No!

96
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:43,424
Wally? Is that a... No!

97
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm gonna be famous.

98
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:56,203
The demon that killed
Sam Winchester.

99
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:59,340
They're gonna tell stories
about me.

100
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:06,647
No, they won't.

101
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:28,402
Each of us has a time when
the physical body dies

102
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:30,571
and we all face God's judgment
in the end.

103
00:05:30,573 --> 00:05:33,707
There's not one of us alive
walking on this earthly plane

104
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,943
that will not pay the
consequence for their actions.

105
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:38,379
The Lord will hold us
in the palm of his hand

106
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:39,747
and he'll weigh our souls.

107
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:42,216
Brothers and sisters,
are you worthy?

108
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:47,555
Hey, Mom.

109
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:49,256
Sam.

110
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:50,858
Dean.

111
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,192
Wally. Hi.

112
00:05:52,194 --> 00:05:53,661
These are my sons. Hi.

113
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:56,030
Glad to meet you.
She said a lot of good things.

114
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:57,531
Yeah. Right back at you, man.

115
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,034
Your, your mom's
real proud of you boys.

116
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:02,670
Cass.

117
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:05,706
Thanks for coming.
I know you're busy.

118
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,174
Well, not really.

119
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:10,144
So, what? No luck with
Lucifer's kid?

120
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:12,746
No, Kelly Kline...
It's like she's...

121
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,315
just disappeared.

122
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:17,751
Lucifer's kid.
That's a joke, right? The...

123
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:24,058
It's not a joke.

124
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:28,295
All right, ramblers,
let's get rambling.

125
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,865
Lucifer has a kid?

126
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,658
Hey, what's the,
Wi-Fi password here?

127
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:00,762
Extra cheese.

128
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:03,697
Everyone is clear on the plan?
At 10:45, demon comes home.

129
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,032
Sam and I will be waiting
for him.

130
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:07,134
I'll pop him with
a Devil's Trap bullet.

131
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,569
I'll finish him off
with a demon blade.

132
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:10,104
And I will wait
at the back with you

133
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:11,672
in case he comes in that way.

134
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,974
Cool, cool. What do I do?
Keep a lookout. Don't die.

135
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,943
Everything is gonna be fine.

136
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:46,674
Mary?

137
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:55,949
Where were you?

138
00:07:55,951 --> 00:07:57,584
Bathroom.

139
00:07:57,586 --> 00:08:00,654
I get nervous sometimes.

140
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,723
Urination.

141
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,458
I understand.

142
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:11,365
Wally?

143
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,767
Heads up, Mary.
He's coming back early.

144
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:26,940
You mind explainin'
why you broke into my house?

145
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:31,879
I know it wasn't just
to ruin the evening catch.

146
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,649
Hunters.

147
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,198
Well, that didn't work.

148
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:57,771
Angel.

149
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:00,474
Aah!

150
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,923
Hiya, sweetheart.

151
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,794
Aah!

152
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:23,096
Run!

153
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:28,001
Aah!

154
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,205
Guys, we got a problem.

155
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:33,473
- Yeah, we know.
- No, you don't. Demons incoming.

156
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:36,043
All right, get to Mom and Cass.
We got this. Go.

157
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:39,446
<font color="#D09090">You ready?

158
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:41,181
First time for everything.

159
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,491
Been a long time since
I've seen an angel.

160
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:53,227
Yeah.

161
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,138
But not long enough.

162
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,741
Is that a... No! No! No!

163
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:10,010
Aah!

164
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:15,883
Where do you think you're going?

165
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,956
Come on.

166
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:34,201
Cass. My...

167
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:36,003
Where is he? I don't know.

168
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,537
Where is he? Come on.

169
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,508
Can you heal yourself?

170
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,511
I tried. Something's wrong.

171
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:45,879
How bad is it?

172
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,884
Sam.

173
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:52,319
Hey, where are you?

174
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,321
Farm down the road.
It looks abandoned.

175
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:57,991
Take your first left and drive
until you see a barn.

176
00:11:57,993 --> 00:12:00,294
Yeah, okay. We're on the way.
Are you okay?

177
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:01,628
No.

178
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:09,002
No.

179
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,204
What the hell just happened?

180
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,341
Where's Wally?

181
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,343
Wally...

182
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,911
God.

183
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,714
Cass?

184
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,984
Mom, where did those
other demons come from?

185
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,586
I don't know. I...

186
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,122
The target. Did you see... No.

187
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,157
He brushed off everything
we threw at him.

188
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,493
- Did you see his eyes?
- What?

189
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,929
They were yellow.

190
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,333
He had yellow eyes.

191
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,102
Mom...

192
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,038
what the hell
did you get us into?

193
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,496
That's him?

194
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,966
That's the big bad demon
you need help with?

195
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,768
Just some old guy.

196
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,507
Technically, I'm in my 60s.

197
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,145
Okay, then.

198
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,013
Hell, what do I know?

199
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,182
I've never gone after
a demon before.

200
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,551
I don't even know why
you called me.

201
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,788
Because if Sam and Dean think
they're helping you and not me,

202
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,157
they won't ask
the wrong questions.

203
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,225
It's safer that way.

204
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,594
Right.

205
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,765
You get those from
your new limey friends?

206
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,101
Them fancy Men of Letters?

207
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,469
I did.

208
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,204
You trust 'em?

209
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,642
I-I just mean, I-I heard
the sales pitch...

210
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,977
Money, gear.

211
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,546
It all sounds swell,

212
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,247
but someone walks up to you
and offers you something

213
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,417
that sounds a little too good
to be true?

214
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,188
I wonder, what's the catch?

215
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,890
Since I've been working
with them,

216
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,393
we've taken out more than
a dozen vamp nests,

217
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,094
four werewolf packs,

218
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,530
and a ghoul who was eating
his way through Arlington.

219
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,632
We saved a lot of people.

220
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,568
Right, so you do trust them.

221
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,306
Let's go.

222
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,376
Yeah.

223
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,212
Hey, Mandy, when do you get off?

224
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,980
Whenever I can.

225
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,082
You meet them fancy
Men of Letters?

226
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,083
British Men of Letters?

227
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,651
Yeah, they got gear,

228
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,119
but, you know, they tried
to kill my brother.

229
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,021
All right, Internet's up.
We're in business.

230
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,591
Everything's gonna be fine.

231
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,271
Doesn't appear to be warded.

232
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,808
Okay. Let's get to work.

233
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,825
Sam?

234
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,426
Where's Dean?

235
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,262
He's out stashing the car.

236
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,830
Okay. Wait, Mom?

237
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,398
Um...

238
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,135
I just wanted to make sure
that, um...

239
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,436
you're okay.

240
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,372
I mean, I know...

241
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,807
you never really wanted this.

242
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,612
Since when is life about
getting what you want?

243
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,519
Mary?

244
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,394
Where were you?

245
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,596
Bathroom.

246
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,265
I get nervous sometimes.

247
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,004
Well, that didn't work.

248
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,539
Aah!

249
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,635
Mary.

250
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,805
Mary. Hey.

251
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,873
Hey.

252
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,475
How you feeling?

253
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,445
What the hell just happened?

254
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,113
Where's Wally?

255
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,848
Wally...

256
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,216
God.

257
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,985
Cass?

258
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,023
Mom, where did those
other demons come from?

259
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,325
I don't know. Hey. Wow.

260
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,527
You look like hammered crap.

261
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,362
Yeah, that sounds about right.

262
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,531
Let's see.

263
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,900
Aah!

264
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,469
Ooh.

265
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,104
All right, okay.

266
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,172
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, hey, you know what?

267
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,642
I've had worse. Yeah? When?

268
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,613
- Dean, something's wrong.
- I...

269
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,582
I can't heal myself.

270
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,016
I think the...

271
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,985
I think the demon's s-spear
was poisoned.

272
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,854
I don't...

273
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,455
I-I think I'm dying.

274
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,960
No. No, you just need
some time, okay?

275
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,395
You'll heal up
the old-fashioned way.

276
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,700
Mom...

277
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,101
what the hell
did you get us into?

278
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,070
Sam.

279
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,504
Sammy!

280
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,017
You idiots!

281
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,253
You're all going to die.

282
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:03,975
You idiots!
You're all going to die.

283
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:06,442
Well, this day just keeps
gettin' better.

284
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:07,744
Crowley?

285
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:09,545
You're him?

286
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:10,813
The King of Hell?

287
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:12,682
You must be Mother Winchester.

288
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:14,784
Pleasure. I've heard so much.

289
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:16,486
Touch me and I'll kill you.

290
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:20,690
What's up with Feathers?

291
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:22,225
What are you even doing here?

292
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:25,094
- How'd you find us?
Wait a second.

293
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:28,097
The demons. They were yours.

294
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:30,133
Obviously.
They killed my friend.

295
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:33,369
Your friend was stupid.
You're all...

296
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:35,605
Do you know what you've done?

297
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:41,678
Does the name Ramiel mean
anything to you?

298
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,413
No. Yes.

299
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:46,649
What?

300
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:50,153
Ramiel, Prince of Hell.

301
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:55,124
Ramiel, Prince of Hell.
It's catchy. It rhymes.

302
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:58,361
And he's going to kill
each and every one of you.

303
00:20:58,363 --> 00:21:01,431
No. The Princes are all dead.

304
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,633
That's what we told people
to stop them looking.

305
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:05,635
But in reality, not so much.

306
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:09,639
W-what the hell
is a Prince of... Hell?

307
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:11,240
The oldest of the old demons.

308
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:13,910
The first generation
after Lilith.

309
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:16,746
Lucifer turned them him himself,

310
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:20,450
before the oceans
drank Atlantis.

311
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,386
They were trained
to be generals,

312
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:26,823
to lead demonic armies
in the war against Heaven.

313
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:29,459
Like Azazel.

314
00:21:32,297 --> 00:21:34,163
They even have his eyes.

315
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:54,217
Who are you?

316
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,386
And what do you want?

317
00:21:57,388 --> 00:21:59,589
The name's Crowley.

318
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:07,430
King of the Crossroads?

319
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:14,036
I've been sent by Hell.

320
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:18,040
And what? Don't they teach you
how to knock in hell?

321
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:22,445
For that, I apologize.
But I do come bearing gifts.

322
00:22:25,216 --> 00:22:27,950
The first is from all demonkind.

323
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:29,652
We heard that
you collect weapons...

324
00:22:29,654 --> 00:22:32,021
The more ancient and arcane,
the better.

325
00:22:32,023 --> 00:22:34,390
So may I present

326
00:22:34,392 --> 00:22:38,127
the Lance of Michael,
the Archangel.

327
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,368
Impressive.

328
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,337
This beauty,
she kills the bad ones fast

329
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:51,574
and the good ones slow
and painful.

330
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:53,910
Ironic, seeing as it was
made by an angel.

331
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:56,712
There's only one angel
Michael wanted to kill,

332
00:22:56,714 --> 00:22:59,615
and he wanted that
son of a bitch to suffer.

333
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:01,584
The magic.

334
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:04,554
It's all in the runework.

335
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:07,089
The craftsmanship.

336
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:12,895
The second gift is from myself.

337
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:15,097
Personally.

338
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:21,270
Something I thought
you might like.

339
00:23:36,654 --> 00:23:38,588
Where did you get this?

340
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,892
It's amazing what some people
just leave laying about.

341
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:50,600
Consider it
your coronation present.

342
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:52,001
Pardon?

343
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:53,970
Brings me to your final gift...

344
00:23:53,972 --> 00:23:56,205
The Throne of Hell.

345
00:23:59,377 --> 00:24:01,110
You want me to be king?

346
00:24:01,112 --> 00:24:03,446
Well, with Lilith
and Azazel dead,

347
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:07,750
and Lucifer back in his box,
we need a ruler.

348
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:10,686
You are next in line, Ramiel.

349
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,521
Prince of Hell.

350
00:24:12,523 --> 00:24:14,023
It's just a name.

351
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:15,992
Doesn't mean anything.

352
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:19,896
Still, the crown is yours
if you want it.

353
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:22,164
I don't.

354
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,833
You take it.

355
00:24:23,835 --> 00:24:26,068
I...

356
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:28,537
Pardon?

357
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:30,373
You seem ambitious enough,

358
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,942
conniving enough,

359
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:34,844
slimy enough.

360
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,347
So take it!

361
00:24:40,018 --> 00:24:42,752
Go for the glory, kid.

362
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:46,389
I mean, one dares to dream,

363
00:24:46,391 --> 00:24:49,358
but what about the others?

364
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,160
You're not the only prince.

365
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:56,732
Azazel was a fanatic,

366
00:24:56,734 --> 00:25:00,303
a true believer
in Lucifer's master plan.

367
00:25:00,305 --> 00:25:01,804
But the rest of us?

368
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:05,308
Well, the truth is, we stopped
caring a long time ago.

369
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:10,279
Asmodeus has his hobbies.
Dagon has her toys.

370
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:12,882
We're happy where we are.

371
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:14,684
So if you want the crown,
it's yours.

372
00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:16,919
Otherwise...

373
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:18,621
Hell, ye...

374
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:20,690
I'll take it.

375
00:25:21,926 --> 00:25:25,027
I mean, I graciously accept.

376
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:31,100
Swell, but there is one thing.

377
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:33,803
Nothing comes without a price.

378
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:37,606
Well, this should be
easy enough.

379
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:42,111
Leave us alone.

380
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:44,947
And make sure everyone else
does the same.

381
00:25:44,949 --> 00:25:49,785
If anyone... anything...
Bothers a Prince of Hell,

382
00:25:49,787 --> 00:25:53,689
that's gonna be
on your head, Crowley.

383
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:57,159
And you don't wanna know
what happens

384
00:25:57,161 --> 00:25:59,228
when you piss us off.

385
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:04,900
I humbly accept your terms.

386
00:26:04,902 --> 00:26:09,739
My demons were there to keep
people away from Ramiel.

387
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:11,407
Believe me,
that's a hornet's nest

388
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:13,509
you do not want to be kicking.

389
00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:16,078
Too late. What happened to Cass?

390
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,882
You tell me.

391
00:26:19,884 --> 00:26:23,352
He got stabbed with some kind
of silver-tipped spear.

392
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:30,459
It's not a spear.

393
00:26:31,562 --> 00:26:33,095
It's a lance.

394
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:36,332
The Lance of Michael.

395
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:37,967
Michael.

396
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:41,604
As in Michael Michael?

397
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:44,774
Nasty bit of business.

398
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:46,375
Kills everything it touches.

399
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:50,246
If you're a demon, you go up
in a puff of smoke.

400
00:26:50,248 --> 00:26:52,148
If you're an angel,

401
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,518
you just... rot away.

402
00:26:56,754 --> 00:26:58,721
Sorry, Castiel.

403
00:26:58,723 --> 00:27:01,557
No. No.

404
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,025
There's a cure.

405
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:05,628
There's always a cure,
and we will find it.

406
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,630
How? We trap Ramiel.

407
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:09,565
And we beat his ass
until he gives it up.

408
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,133
It's not gonna work.

409
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:13,002
We took down the Darkness
and the Devil.

410
00:27:13,004 --> 00:27:16,338
It took you years
to defeat Lucifer,

411
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,009
and the power of God
to stop the Darkness.

412
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:23,712
Maybe if you had more time,
you could manage Ramiel.

413
00:27:23,714 --> 00:27:27,149
But right now, in this barn...

414
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:33,189
Hey, I was growing fond
of the choir boy, too.

415
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:35,658
Shut up. Shut up.

416
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,395
We don't have time, okay,
for your... for you.

417
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:42,731
So either help us
or get the hell out of here!

418
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:50,439
Yeah, figures.

419
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:25,574
What can I do to keep you
out of that barn?

420
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:31,380
I smell the angel.

421
00:28:31,382 --> 00:28:33,949
He's rotting.

422
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:36,051
These people...

423
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:37,987
They your friends?

424
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:39,688
I don't have friends.

425
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,791
I make deals with those
I can use.

426
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:46,262
Every kingdom needs allies,
even Hell.

427
00:28:46,264 --> 00:28:48,964
Allies. Is that what you call
three humans

428
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:53,669
with one good liver between them
and a busted up angel?

429
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:56,605
I admit, they don't sound
like much.

430
00:28:56,607 --> 00:28:57,907
But every Armageddon,

431
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:02,611
every bloody “this is the end
of all things,”

432
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:05,714
a Winchester stopped it.

433
00:29:05,716 --> 00:29:10,920
Like it or not, they're an asset
we can't afford to lose.

434
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:16,825
We had an agreement, Crowley.

435
00:29:16,827 --> 00:29:19,428
No one bothers us.

436
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,796
You remember?

437
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:22,831
We made one deal.

438
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,200
Let's make another.

439
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:30,372
What do you say?

440
00:29:34,845 --> 00:29:36,779
Aah!

441
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,579
We don't have time, okay,
for your... for you.

442
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:20,949
So either help us
or get the hell out of here!

443
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:27,956
Yeah, figures.

444
00:30:32,963 --> 00:30:35,130
Cass, how bad is it?

445
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:43,038
Crowley's right. You should go.

446
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,041
Cass, come on.
No, you listen to me.

447
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:48,977
You... Look, thank you.

448
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:50,546
Thank you.

449
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,581
Knowing you, it...

450
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:55,083
it's been the best part
of my life.

451
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:56,885
And the things that...

452
00:30:56,887 --> 00:30:58,787
the things
we've shared together,

453
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:00,556
they have changed me.

454
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,832
You're my family.

455
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:14,903
I love you.

456
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:19,241
I love all of you.

457
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,053
Just please...

458
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,389
please, don't make
my last moments be spent

459
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:36,391
watching you die.

460
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:38,193
Just run.

461
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:40,696
Save yourselves.

462
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:44,766
And I will hold Ramiel off
as long as I can.

463
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,504
Cass, no.

464
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,239
Yes.

465
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,107
You need to keep fighting.

466
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:53,542
We are fighting.

467
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,477
We're fighting for you, Cass.

468
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,381
And like you said,
you're family.

469
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:01,650
And we don't leave
family behind.

470
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,567
Mom.

471
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,913
What's the play?

472
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:34,082
We hit him with everything
we got.

473
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,175
Toasty.

474
00:33:00,177 --> 00:33:02,377
You stabbed one of our friends.

475
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:05,414
Your friend was trespassing.

476
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,316
Tell us how to cure him.

477
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,524
There is no cure.

478
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:21,530
You have any idea who we are?

479
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,865
I don't care.

480
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,271
I don't care who you are.
I don't care why you're here.

481
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:32,507
I don't care about Heaven
or Hell or anything.

482
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:36,878
I don't even care that
Lucifer's got a bun in the oven.

483
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,880
You know about that?

484
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:41,950
My sister Dagon,
she's taken an interest.

485
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:43,986
- But me?
- Let me guess.

486
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,887
You don't care.

487
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:49,191
All I wanted
was to be left alone.

488
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,127
But then you come.

489
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:56,064
You... steal from me.

490
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:03,472
And that? Ooh.
That I cannot abide.

491
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,680
Give me back what's mine,

492
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:16,284
or I take it off
your lifeless bodies.

493
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,855
You've got...

494
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,057
30 seconds.

495
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,300
Obviously, we got no idea
what you're talking about.

496
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:33,935
20 seconds.

497
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,820
Have it your way.

498
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,029
Aah!

499
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,880
Cass.

500
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,184
Hey, buddy.
Hey, we're here, Cass.

501
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:57,919
We're right here, buddy.

502
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,239
The magic.

503
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,274
It's all in the runework.

504
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:21,265
The craftsmanship.

505
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:25,614
Hang in there, all right?
What do we do?

506
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,133
The magic's
in the craftsmanship.

507
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,344
Cass?

508
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:04,853
You're welcome.

509
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:29,147
So... you're good?

510
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:31,116
I guess so.

511
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:36,588
What did he...

512
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,491
What did he mean about
somebody stealing from him?

513
00:37:40,527 --> 00:37:42,994
Who knows what that crazy man
was talkin' about.

514
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,199
Let's go home.

515
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:13,958
Well, that's...

516
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,794
quite a story.

517
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:17,395
You did well.

518
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:20,732
You sent me after
a damn Prince of Hell.

519
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:22,300
Well, we didn't know
what he was.

520
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:24,836
We just knew he had the item.

521
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,504
That's not good enough.

522
00:38:26,506 --> 00:38:29,174
I lost a friend.
I almost lost one of my boys.

523
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:31,676
And we apologize... Shut up.

524
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,079
Anything like that
happens again... anything...

525
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:38,049
And I will burn you down.

526
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:40,251
All of you.

527
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:46,090
Is that a threat?

528
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:49,561
It's a promise.

529
00:38:57,404 --> 00:38:59,671
We made a mistake.

530
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:05,109
I'm sorry.

531
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:21,492
Can I... see it?

532
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,914
Hello, beautiful.

533
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:48,353
My father used to tell me
stories about this thing.

534
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:50,255
You know there's only five
things in all Creation

535
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:53,124
it can't kill?

536
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:54,826
Yes.

537
00:39:57,097 --> 00:40:01,232
I know all about the Colt.

538
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,440
Search that house.

539
00:40:09,442 --> 00:40:10,942
Search it again.

540
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:13,645
Find me that gun.

541
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:36,401
Bang!

542
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:41,306
Man.

543
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:44,876
I suppose you think that's funny.

544
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:52,684
I know that look.

545
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:55,954
Sam and Dean have got you down.

546
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:58,856
Well, I still can't believe
that you're working

547
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:02,527
for the Dukes of Haphazard.

548
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:06,531
Do you really think
they care about you?

549
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:11,035
I mean, think about it, Crowley.

550
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:13,538
They kill your kind.

551
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,674
It's in their blood.

552
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:19,377
And you know...

553
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:21,512
you know...

554
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:24,529
it's only a matter of time
before they come...

555
00:41:24,553 --> 00:41:25,784
for you.

556
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:28,786
Shut your mouth, dog.

557
00:41:32,258 --> 00:41:33,858
That's not my name.

558
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:43,765
