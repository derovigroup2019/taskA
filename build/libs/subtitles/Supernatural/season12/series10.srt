Hello, my love.

Hey. Hey.

00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:32,883
I thought you were supposed
to keep her out of this.

Yeah, I changed my mind.

And...while it's true
that I didn't know

we were killing an innocent,

I truly can't imagine

for me,

What Ishim said...

You're not weak, Cass.
You know that, right?

00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,303
I mean, obviously,
you've changed,

766

but it's all been
for the better, man.

767

every step

of this long,
crazy thrill ride.

And no matter how crazy it got,
you never backed down.

Cass, I don't like how the whole
Billie thing went down. Okay?

I know you think you were
doing the right thing.

And I'm not mad. I'm worried.

775
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:23,862
Because things like
“cosmic consequences”

if you find Kelly
and, uh, Lucifer Junior?

It is a Nephilim, right?

Oh, no. It's more than that.

784
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:50,889
An ordinary Nephilim is one of
the most dangerous beings
