1
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:05,906
You know, Claire,
you go down this path, our path,

2
00:00:05,907 --> 00:00:07,306
it's not a long life.

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,341
I solemnly swear
not to hunt like a dumbass.

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,643
Claire, do your homework before
you do anything stupid, okay?

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:14,079
And we're here
if you need us, any time.

6
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,448
“Werewolves that are turned
up to four generations

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,483
“from pureblood are less feral
and can transform

8
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,753
before, during,
and after the lunar cycle”.

9
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,421
I mean,
werewolves are badass.

10
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,823
The old men want
the Winchesters,

11
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,458
so I made a play for Dean,

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,561
and it was working until
<i>your</i> operation went sideways.

13
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,344
I'm in.

14
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:32,365
You're changing the world,
and I wanna be a part of it.

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,032
Dean, because of Mick
and his guys,

16
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,967
the Alpha Vampire is dead.

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,836
What do you want me to say?
Do I like it? No.

18
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,071
Do I trust them?
Hell, no.

19
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,840
We work with people
we don't trust all the time.

20
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:45,577
So if you wanna give this
a shot, then fine.

21
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:10,035
“Are you calling me a liar?
Seriously?”

22
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,570
?

23
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,277
Yeah. Seriously.

24
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,746
You're so busted.

25
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,857
You are beyond lame,
you know that?

26
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,493
Let's just go back.
Please?

27
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,429
I'll get you in.

28
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,998
Ever had a Moscow Mule?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,600
A Moscow Mule?

30
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,770
Will you just, for once,
act your age?

31
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,540
Says the guy who doesn't even
have his own car.

32
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,609
Stop hounding Mom about
buying us a car, all right?

33
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,979
She's doing the best
she can.

34
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:57,749
Two more years,
I am so gone.

35
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,185
Hold up!

36
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,853
Did you hear that?

37
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,291
Yeah.
They're called animals.

38
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,360
Let's just go back into town.
No, Hayden, we're going.

39
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,863
Have you, like, never seen
a horror movie?

40
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,432
Two kids, dark road,

41
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,534
creepy noise in the woods?

42
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,137
We keep walking...
and boom!

43
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,939
You are such a drama queen.

44
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,265
All right,
there's nothing there.

45
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:23,009
But I --

46
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,577
No, fine. I'll prove it.

47
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:32,150
?

48
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,323
Sucker.

49
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:47,265
?

50
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,537
See?

51
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,173
Told you.

52
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,715
Hayden!

53
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,753
- Hayden...
- No.

54
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,589
Oh, my God. Hay.

55
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,691
Help!

56
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,360
Hayden, Hayden, Hayden, Hayden.

57
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,231
Aah!

All right, that's it.
I'm waiting in the car.

61
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,972
Dean, dude, wait a second.
No. You know what?

62
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,841
Getting jobs from these dicks
is one thing,

63
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,576
but I didn't sign up for
this reporting for duty crap,

64
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,444
especially when they're late.
Sorry I'm late.

65
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,782
My report to the home office
ran long.

66
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:14,786
We've had our hands full
since...

67
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,058
Well, best not to dwell
on that.

68
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,427
Wow. That is some
world-class repression.

69
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,895
You <i>are</i> British.

70
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,597
We prefer to call it
a stiff upper lip.

71
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,333
Okay, okay. Enough.

72
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,602
Mick, what's the deal
with the bat signal?

73
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,439
There was an incident
in Wisconsin.

74
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,907
“Animal attack.”

75
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,276
A girl named Hayden Foster's
in the hospital,

76
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,512
and her brother lost his heart.

77
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,946
Looks like a werewolf.

78
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,882
Well, they don't usually
leave behind survivors.

79
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,417
Freak probably got spooked
before it could finish the job.

80
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,086
Well, perhaps.

81
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,888
But it usually takes
more than a fright

82
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,756
to put your average werewolf
off his supper.

83
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,759
Oh, you'd know that, would you?
Actually, I would.

84
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,363
I did extensive research
into lycanthropy at Kendricks.

85
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,231
Kendricks?

86
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,935
The Kendricks School.
It's where

87
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,537
the British Men of Letters
train their operatives.

88
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,772
It's like our --
Hogwarts?

89
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,240
Exactly.

90
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,143
Kendricks is the largest
collection of occult lore

91
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,579
in the world.
Cool.

92
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,982
So when it comes to werewolves,
I'm not entirely ignorant.

93
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,485
For example, we know
that last night's attack

94
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,053
didn't happen on a full moon.

95
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,888
Therefore, we're looking
for a pureblood.

96
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,690
You think?

97
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,458
It's like a milk run to me.

98
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,360
Then you don't mind
if I tag along?

99
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,398
Mick, um...

100
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,866
Listen, I-I don't think...

101
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,168
I don't think it's really
your kind of thing.

102
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,238
Oh, no, maybe it should be.

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,741
I had the best team,

104
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:47,178
but most of us,
we were thinkers, not fighters.

105
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,813
And let's be honest --
your and your mum,

106
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,348
you're the only reason
I'm still alive.

107
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,817
So now you wanna be like us?
No.

108
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,787
I just want to be ready
for whatever's next.

109
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,460
Dude, he is dead weight,
and you know it.

110
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,895
Look, Mick's inexperienced,
sure.

111
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,863
But these people have
some serious knowledge.

112
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,033
So? Dude, what we do, you can't
learn this crap in a book.

113
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,302
You put on a flannel, you pick
up a gun, you go out there.

114
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,271
Either you get good fast
or you get dead faster.

115
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,806
We're working
with these people now

116
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,609
and -- and we're getting wins.
We're saving people.

117
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,411
The better they are,
the better we are.

118
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,313
Look, Mick held his own
with the Alpha.

119
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,148
Why not give him a shot?
Maybe he'll come in handy.

120
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,051
And what if
he gets himself killed?

121
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,321
I heard that.
Good.

122
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,023
If he's coming,
you're babysitting him.

123
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:35,260
?

124
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,532
<i>In Luther's 27th thesis,</i>

125
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,568
<i>the word “jingle” is</i>
<i>an obvious nod</i>

126
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,237
<i>to a canny 15th century monk...</i>

127
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,973
Had to let him listen
to his podcast, huh?

128
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,408
Dude, it's educational.

129
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,443
And besides, I've been wanting
to listen to this one.

130
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,979
You know,
monks like Martin Luther

131
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,015
are among the earliest Hunters.

132
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,017
He even wrote parts
of that book you're holding.

133
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,519
What? This lore dates back
to the 16th century?

134
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,588
Yeah. Well, in Europe,
everything's old.

135
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,390
Though we do have
our fair share of new tricks

136
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,692
for dealing with wolves --
sulfate gas,

137
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,394
silver nitrate lethal injection.

138
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,829
Take a handful of silver bullets
over any of that fancy crap.

139
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,867
Yes, well,
thanks to that “fancy crap,”

140
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,703
Britain's last werewolf outbreak
was in the '20s.

141
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,706
We rooted them out,
bitten and pureblood alike.

142
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,041
Wait a second.
You killed them all?

143
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,742
Even the ones that weren't
hurting anyone?

144
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,568
Sorry?

145
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:27,878
I mean, werewolves aren't
like most monsters.

146
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,448
Some can control it. I mean,
we -- we have a buddy got bit.

147
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,116
Nothing but beef hearts
ever since.

148
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,718
And you trust him?

149
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,888
Well, killing is a fundamental
need for werewolves.

150
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,490
And monsters don't just stop
being monsters.

151
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,992
Well, Garth did.

152
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,962
Oh, turn here.

153
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,199
?

154
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,980
This place, uh,
seems a little...

155
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,749
Shabby? Yeah.

156
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,351
Three stars was the best
I could do.

157
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,353
Least our bean counters
will be happy.

158
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,954
Booked us all suites.

159
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,724
Wait, you...
We're in separate rooms?

160
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,625
Yeah, of course.

161
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,094
You say three stars?

162
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,662
Yeah.

163
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,198
So we're talking fresh towels,
little baby shampoos?

164
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,133
Uh-huh.
And I believe there's a pool.

165
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,534
Welcome, sir. Mm-hmm.
Cheers, mate.

166
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,903
Get the bags.

167
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:35,012
?

168
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,423
?

169
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:46,891
Thanks.

170
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,327
Man. Those pillows, right?

171
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,762
The little chocolates
that they put on?

172
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,163
I mean, I'm ruined, Sam.

173
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,432
Those limey sons of bitches
ruined me.

174
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,467
I even took a swim
this morning.

175
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,869
You brought a swimsuit?

176
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,671
No.
Ugh.

177
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,492
What'd you get up to?

178
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:03,208
I read through more
of Mick's lore books.

179
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,778
Really? Wow. Those three stars
are wasted on you.

180
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,713
Anyways, listen to this.
It's crazy.

181
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,115
So apparently, back in the '30s,
they were working on

182
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,850
this treatment for werewolves.

183
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,285
This, like, blood therapy.

184
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,220
Plasma therapy.

185
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,889
Useless, I'm afraid.

186
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,426
So how were
your accommodations, lads?

187
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,263
I've had better nights sleep
in my baby.

188
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,200
Get in. Let's go.

189
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,604
Not gonna give him
the satisfaction.

190
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,197
Wait, wait. Let us.

191
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,499
Talking to a grieving family,
it's tougher than you think.

192
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,602
Oh, I'm a quick study.
Well, good for you.

193
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,103
Okay, stay here, keep watch.

194
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,706
Anything comes up...
I don't know, whistle.

195
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,212
Ms. Foster?

196
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,380
Sorry to bother you.
Agent McVie.

197
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,915
This is my partner,
Agent Fleetwood.

198
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,685
Um, we'd like to ask
your daughter a few questions.

199
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,520
She's sleeping.

200
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,921
We'll be quick. Promise.

201
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,623
I said no.

202
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,897
Hayden needs
her rest. She's...

203
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,335
Good morning.
And how is our patient today?

204
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,239
I'm sorry. Who are you?

205
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,642
Dr. Buckingham. Hayden's
attending doctor, Dr. Markum,

206
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,210
asked me to look in on her.

207
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,712
Um, would it be okay

208
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,814
to ask you just to step outside
for a moment?

209
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,850
I, um...Of course, Doctor.

210
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,853
Sure.
Thank you.

211
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,426
Here. Please.
Thank you.

212
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,928
No problem.

213
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,731
I'm sorry,
about all that.

214
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,533
Oh, please.

215
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,055
After what you've been through,
you have no reason to apologize.

216
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,106
Where's my mom?

217
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,707
Your mum's just outside.

218
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,943
Just gonna take a quick look,
make sure you're okay.

219
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,611
Brave girl.

220
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,513
I don't know what happened.

221
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,915
It was so fast.

222
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,883
You've had quite a shock.

223
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:30,521
I just -- I don't even know what
my kids were doing out there.

224
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,456
You know, Hayden was supposed
to be sleeping

225
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,725
at her friend's house,
and -- and Ben...

226
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,069
I just keep thinking
this is a nightmare, you know?

227
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,572
That I'm gonna wake up.

228
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,711
Okay.

229
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,547
I'm just glad
the FBI is here,

230
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,416
not those crazies.

231
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,285
Crazies?
Bigfoot truthers.

232
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,753
Calling, sending e-mails.

233
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,957
They thought Hayden was...

234
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,159
Like I said. Crazy.

235
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,161
Huh.
Some girl even came by here

236
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:15,633
saying she was from
the Fish and Wildlife Service.

237
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,068
Barely as old as Hayden.

238
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,569
I mean, like I'm gonna
buy that.

239
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,407
You remember
what she looked like?

240
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,777
Yeah. Blonde.
Bad attitude.

241
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,414
I actually -- I have her card
right here.

242
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,249
Good.

243
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,985
Ah.

244
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,857
Ohh. No.

245
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,800
Okay.

246
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,670
You're okay.

247
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,773
You relax, okay?

248
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,608
Oh.

249
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,910
Is she...

250
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,446
Wound's healing up nicely.

251
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,315
Nothing too serious.

252
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,084
Oh, that's so --
Thank you so much.

253
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:07,653
Pleasure.

254
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,220
Excuse me.

255
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,592
Doc?

256
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,160
So?

257
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,728
Was Hayden bit?

258
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,399
No. No, she's a lucky girl.

259
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:25,302
Good. What about, uh,
Fish and Wildlife Service?

260
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,039
Think it's another hunter?
Young, blonde, pissed off.

261
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,674
Sound like anybody we know?

262
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,910
?

263
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,795
“Campus is nice.”

264
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,466
Oh.

265
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,907
Hello? Uh, this is
Agent Beatrice Quimby.

266
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,109
<i>Oh, thank God. There's a bear.</i>

267
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,445
<i>It's the size</i>
<i>of a freakin' tank!</i>

268
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,346
<i>I think</i>
<i>it wants my pic-a-nic basket!</i>

269
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,915
Mm-hmm.

270
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,983
Hi, Dean.

271
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,520
So Fish and Wildlife?
Really?

272
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,955
Claire, what are you
doing here?

273
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,591
Same as you. Werewolf case.

274
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,993
Now. Beers all around.

275
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,363
Who are you?
Oh. Mick Davies.

276
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,867
Men of Letters. British.

277
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:34,271
Long story. And, like,
“Downton Abbey” boring, so...

278
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,873
No. Unh-unh.

279
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,512
Okay. Anyway...

280
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,448
I've been on this a day.
And guess what?

281
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,016
The girl, Hayden?

282
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,284
Her story about what happened
the night of the attack?

283
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,120
One big lie.

284
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,422
Her mom said the same thing.
Where was she?

285
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,858
She was at the local dive bar,
gettin' trashed.

286
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,676
I tracked her phone
and asked around and...

287
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,863
Bartenders love me.
It's a gift.

288
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,565
Right. You get anything else?

289
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,868
The guy I talked to
was a scumbag.

290
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,171
Tribal tat, motorcycle,
grabby.

291
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,173
Grabby?

292
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,408
I'm a big girl. I handled it.

293
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,744
Right.
Think I'm gonna call it a night.

294
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,080
D-dude, it's 5:30.

295
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,415
Yeah, but my report's due
at 6:00 sharp.

296
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,784
All work, no play.

297
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,285
Nice meeting ya.

298
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,423
So your foreign exchange student
is totally lame.

299
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,125
Yeah.
He's Sam's best friend.

300
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,861
They're like nerd soul mates.

301
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,164
Anyway, why are you alone?

302
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,633
Jody's busy
with sheriff stuff.

303
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,968
And she said to call if
I found anything.

304
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,204
So you called her?

305
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,006
You called first.

306
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,642
And she's great, by the way.
And so is Alex.

307
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,377
So should we go to
the morgue?

308
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,113
Take it easy, Clarice.
Morgue's closed.

309
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,581
By the way, when's the last time
you had a hot meal

310
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,417
that didn't come from
a-a Gas-n-Sip microwave?

311
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,520
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

312
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,322
It's been a while.

313
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,990
Well...

314
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,962
Go nuts. It's on, uh,
Harry Potter.

315
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,131
Cool.

316
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,319
?

317
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,543
I'm sorry.

318
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,591
?

319
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,893
No!

320
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,997
No!

321
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:56,509
Thanks for coming by
so quickly.

322
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:57,877
Ms. Foster gave us
your number.

323
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,512
You have any idea
what happened to her?

324
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:00,913
Autopsy's tomorrow,

325
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:02,615
but it could be
an arterial embolism,

326
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:06,219
cardiac arrest.
A heart attack at her age?

327
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:07,887
It gets weirder.

328
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:11,257
When we admitted her, she had
defensive wounds to her arms.

329
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:12,959
Now...

330
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:15,862
they're gone.

331
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,501
Just, uh, give me a second.

332
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:23,469
Sure.
Mm.

333
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:26,039
Okay...what the hell?

334
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,908
You checked Hayden out.
Did you notice anything weird?

335
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,444
No, but, uh, the girl could've
had internal injuries or...

336
00:18:31,446 --> 00:18:35,515
But somehow, her external
injuries all healed? No way.

337
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:37,717
This is almost like, uh...

338
00:18:39,054 --> 00:18:41,988
You know,
what if she turned?

339
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,290
What, like,
“wolfed out” turned?

340
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:46,793
Explains the whole
Wolverine healing factor thing.

341
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:48,194
Yeah, no,
but that'd be crazy

342
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:50,096
because that means
she would've been bit.

343
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:52,298
And Mick here says that
that didn't happen.

344
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,766
Right, Mick?

345
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:55,368
Uh...

346
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,203
Uh, no, not -- not that I saw.

347
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:59,839
Are you 100%?

348
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:01,341
Unless I made a mistake.

349
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:03,009
Hell of a mistake.
Dean...

350
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:04,477
No, I told you we shouldn't
have dragged him along.

351
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,145
I told you!
Don't!

352
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:08,981
Whatever got Hayden is
still out there.

353
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,917
Okay.

354
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,319
So let's say
the night of the attack,

355
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:15,455
wolf ices big bro,
chomps down on a little sis,

356
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:18,391
and then...poof, vanishes?
Does that make any sense?

357
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:21,060
Maybe he let her go.

358
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,296
On purpose? Why?

359
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:27,066
Perhaps he didn't want her dead.
He wanted her turned.

360
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:30,636
Right. Which means
this wasn't random.

361
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,171
Which means it would've been
somebody who knew her.

362
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:34,674
Friends, family.
Or someone from the bar.

363
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,809
Okay. All right, Sam,
you and Claire, you go talk

364
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:39,445
to the girl that she was
supposed to be crashing with,

365
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:42,615
and me and amateur hour will hit
the bar, see what shakes loose.

366
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:45,852
?

367
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:52,358
So... really?
Things are good?

368
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,895
Yeah. They're awesome.

369
00:19:55,897 --> 00:19:57,997
Really? You sure?

370
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,066
Dude, take the yes.

371
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:02,635
Okay.

372
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:05,037
So you wait here.
What?

373
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,706
Sam, no offense,
but who do you think

374
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,541
the kids are gonna
wanna talk to?

375
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:11,544
Me, or some old skeezer?

376
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:13,846
Exactly.

377
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:15,481
Be right back.

378
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,052
Skeezer?

379
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:26,659
Dean,
what happened back there...

380
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:28,828
my mistake,

381
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,464
it won't happen again.
Better not.

382
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,569
Problem?

383
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:39,705
The old carpal tunnel.

384
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:42,942
Well, allow me,
your lordship.

385
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:44,577
Thanks.

386
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:49,515
Howdy.

387
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:51,159
Agent Strummer.
This is Agent Vai.

388
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,119
Uh, hi.

389
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,821
Do you recognize this girl?

390
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:57,623
She was here
three nights ago.

391
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,892
Yeah. Not really.

392
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:02,161
Yeah, I'd lie if I served
underage girls, too.

393
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:08,401
Look, man, I...

394
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:11,471
- I really need this job.
- I...

395
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:15,074
She started coming in
a few weeks ago

396
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:17,944
after Conner got hired.

397
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:19,812
Conner?

398
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:23,649
Yeah, the other bartender.
They're having a thing.

399
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:25,151
What kind of a thing?

400
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:28,688
Ask him.

401
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:31,991
Hi, Conner.

402
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,795
Oh. Nice ink.

403
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:38,231
So you like high school girls,
do you? Hmm?

404
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:40,766
You get older, they stay
the same age. Is that it?

405
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:42,134
That's not how it was.

406
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:43,769
Oh, so you weren't dating
Hayden Foster?

407
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:46,272
Dating? No, I let her in from
time to time.

408
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:48,508
She is stupid hot. Okay?

409
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,277
But that's it. I swear.
And the night she got attacked,

410
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:53,145
did you let her in
that night, too?

411
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:54,614
Look, I don't know
what happened.

412
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:56,315
I was behind the bar
the whole night.

413
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:57,683
I didn't even see her leave.

414
00:21:57,685 --> 00:22:00,119
Hmm.
And then what'd you do?

415
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:02,522
Guess I went home.

416
00:22:02,524 --> 00:22:03,856
You guess?

417
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,291
Well, it's a simple question,
Conner.

418
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:07,193
I ask what you were doing,
then you tell me.

419
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:09,829
For instance, what were
you doing last night?

420
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:13,432
<i>?</i>

421
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:16,235
Me?
Yeah.

422
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:17,904
Oh, I was writing my report.

423
00:22:17,906 --> 00:22:19,872
<i>?</i>

424
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:21,574
And then?

425
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:25,244
<i>?</i>

426
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:28,214
Well, I watched an episode
of “The Great British Bake Off”

427
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:31,617
and went to bed.
Ha! See?

428
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:33,419
Simple.

429
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:34,787
I went home, man.

430
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:37,857
And I didn't do anything
to that girl, okay?

431
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:40,793
Yeah. Well, we'll see.

432
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:43,162
Oh, one more thing. Um...

433
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:46,299
Did you happen to meet a, uh,
blonde girl the other night?

434
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:48,401
About yay high. Feisty?

435
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:50,670
Yeah, yeah.
Said she was Hayden's cousin.

436
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:54,106
Crazy bitch
threw a beer at me.

437
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:56,008
Huh. Well, from what I heard,
you earned it.

438
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,577
What are you, her dad?

439
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:00,279
Dude, come on. Girls like that?

440
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:02,014
Yeah.

441
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:05,751
You ever touch her again,
I'll break your face.

442
00:23:08,823 --> 00:23:10,656
Nice work in there.

443
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:11,450
Thank you.

444
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:12,859
Yeah, that alibi --
I almost bought it.

445
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,098
Sorry?

446
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,922
See, here's the thing
about 16-year-old girls,

447
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:19,765
especially 16-year-old
freshly minted werewolf girls --

448
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,068
they don't just die.

449
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,970
And you've been
acting sketchy all day.

450
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:26,272
Oh, I don't know what
you're talking about.

451
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:28,541
Oh!
What did you do to her?

452
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:30,276
I did what needed
to be done.

453
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:33,312
And that means?
Last night,

454
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:35,881
I injected her with
silver nitrate.

455
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,683
So you killed her?
Well, she attacked me.

456
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:39,952
She tore up my shoulder.
And...

457
00:23:39,954 --> 00:23:42,154
I had orders.
You had a choice.

458
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:44,423
Did I?

459
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:46,092
Killing monsters is
what we do.

460
00:23:46,094 --> 00:23:48,461
Or maybe palling around with
demons and witches,

461
00:23:48,463 --> 00:23:50,596
you've forgotten.
Don't tell me how to do my job.

462
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:53,466
Well, then do it.
You think it's that simple, huh?

463
00:23:53,468 --> 00:23:55,134
I really do.
Yeah?

464
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,570
I used to think
the same thing.

465
00:23:57,572 --> 00:23:59,005
Well, here's a little tip.

466
00:23:59,007 --> 00:24:02,108
Things aren't just
black and white out here.

467
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,211
All you have is a case
in front of you, like Hayden.

468
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:09,048
A few months ago, there was
this kid, this psychic.

469
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,135
She was killing people, but she
didn't mean to hurt anyone.

470
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:13,452
She was being abused.

471
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:15,921
So we gave her
a second chance

472
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:18,290
because it was
the right thing to do.

473
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:23,095
Well...
that's your luxury.

474
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:26,132
We have a code.

475
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:31,837
<i>Thank you, Mr. Ketch.</i>

476
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,839
Well, now Hayden's mom,

477
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:36,409
she gets to bury two kids
instead of one,

478
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:39,879
thanks to you
and thanks to your <i>code.</i>

479
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:41,714
Nice work.

480
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:48,354
I was kidding before,

481
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:50,890
but you really do look
like a creeper.

482
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:53,225
Funny. How'd it go?

483
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:56,062
BFF found. Beans spilled.

484
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,264
Hayden was hooking up with
this older guy on the DL,

485
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,299
and she was really into him,
but he was a total stalker.

486
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:02,968
Texting constantly,
ultra possessive.

487
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,705
Skeeved her friend out so much
she narc'd to Hayden's brother.

488
00:25:05,707 --> 00:25:09,375
Guess that explains why
he was there.

489
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:12,945
I did good, right?

490
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:16,449
Claire, why does Jody think

491
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:19,051
you're in Madison
looking at colleges?

492
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:21,954
You called her?

493
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:27,626
Did you tell?

494
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:31,097
No. Not yet.
But why are you lying to her?

495
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,601
Look, I-I know, okay?

496
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:37,803
I know how much I owe Jody.

497
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:39,472
But we tried
the whole hunting thing,

498
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:41,507
and I just ended up
sitting in the car

499
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:42,942
while she does everything.

500
00:25:42,944 --> 00:25:45,010
Guess she's taking it slow.

501
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:47,780
She wants me to be normal,

502
00:25:47,782 --> 00:25:50,583
go to nursing school
like Alex.

503
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:53,552
Did she actually say that?
She doesn't have to.

504
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,891
I'm better off on my own.

505
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:01,127
This way, everybody's happy.

506
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,865
Claire, Jody's not gonna
be happy when she finds out.

507
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,366
And if something happened
to you...

508
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:08,768
I'm careful!

509
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,036
You need to tell her
the truth.

510
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:13,773
You know what?

511
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:15,207
Screw you.

512
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:17,543
I'm so sick of you guys
dive-bombing my life,

513
00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:19,299
pretending like you care.
We do care.

514
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:21,547
Then stop treating me
like a stupid kid!

515
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:23,182
Then stop acting like one.

516
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:28,487
?

517
00:26:31,793 --> 00:26:33,359
Claire...

518
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:38,531
<i>? ...everything ?</i>

519
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,166
<i>? Opportunities for eternity ?</i>

520
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:45,404
<i>? And I could belong</i>
<i>to the night ?</i>

521
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:47,973
<i>? Then your eyes, your eyes ?</i>

522
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:51,343
<i>? I can see in your eyes ?</i>

523
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:52,711
<i>? Your eyes ?</i>

524
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:56,749
<i>? Everything in your eyes ?</i>

525
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:59,218
? Your eyes ?

526
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,086
? You make me wanna die ?

527
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:04,256
? I'll never be good enough ?

528
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:06,225
? You make me wanna die ?

529
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:11,297
? ...you love
will burn up in the night ?

530
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:16,035
? Look inside your eyes ?

531
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:21,607
? You make me wanna die ?

532
00:27:31,195 --> 00:27:33,195
Oh, my...

533
00:27:33,797 --> 00:27:36,265
Oh!

534
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:40,402
?

535
00:27:45,442 --> 00:27:46,842
Aah!

536
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:48,577
Claire. Claire.

537
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,285
Hey. Hey. Claire.
Hey, it's me. It's me.

538
00:27:51,282 --> 00:27:54,616
It's me. I gotcha. I gotcha.
I gotcha. You're safe.

539
00:27:58,189 --> 00:28:01,423
?

540
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:04,560
We gotta cool her off.
She's burning up.

541
00:28:04,562 --> 00:28:06,161
No. No, no, keep her warm.

542
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:07,362
Back off.
Shut up.

543
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:09,131
Look, I understand
you're angry --

544
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:12,568
Mick, you killed a kid.
We're not angry. We're done!

545
00:28:14,672 --> 00:28:17,039
How long have I got until...

546
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:20,275
Sometimes it takes a full moon.
Sometimes it just takes time.

547
00:28:23,948 --> 00:28:25,447
Hey.

548
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:27,015
Hey, listen to me.

549
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:29,618
Look, nobody said this was
gonna be easy, okay?

550
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,788
But you <i>can</i> live with this.
No way.

551
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,957
Hey. Look, so you -- you have
to stay locked up

552
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,692
a few nights
out of the month, okay?

553
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:38,460
The rest of the time,
you're you.

554
00:28:38,462 --> 00:28:40,329
Unless I break out.

555
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,134
Maybe some people can
control this,

556
00:28:46,136 --> 00:28:49,938
but I can barely
keep it together on a good day.

557
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,541
So if there's any chance

558
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:56,078
I could hurt Jody
or Alex...

559
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,413
or anyone...

560
00:28:58,415 --> 00:29:01,516
I'd rather die.

561
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:04,219
Claire, there may be
another way.

562
00:29:04,221 --> 00:29:06,488
There's -- there's the blood
therapy that you talk about.

563
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,789
I told you, it doesn't work.

564
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,524
It says right here, uh,

565
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:12,594
1 out of 9 test subjects
was cured.

566
00:29:12,596 --> 00:29:14,296
Cured?
Yes.

567
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:15,831
That study was on mice.

568
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,635
You want to tell me what
the hell he's talking about?

569
00:29:19,637 --> 00:29:22,404
We experimented with the blood
of sire werewolves.

570
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:24,373
And we found
it was possible to reverse

571
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:28,343
the early stages of
lycanthropy...in rodents.

572
00:29:28,345 --> 00:29:30,245
So you never tested on humans?

573
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:31,980
Once.
And?

574
00:29:31,982 --> 00:29:35,284
The subject died in agony.

575
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:39,621
Sorry.
Yeah.

576
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,523
Maybe second time's a charm.

577
00:29:41,525 --> 00:29:43,992
Hey, no, no.
You don't get a vote in this.

578
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:45,794
It's my life.

579
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,896
I get all the votes.

580
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:49,965
Sam, you wanna
back me up here?

581
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:52,501
It's her life.

582
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:59,141
I bet you think this is
a great solution. Hmm?

583
00:29:59,143 --> 00:30:01,710
It works, or she dies.

584
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,545
Either way,
one less monster, right?

585
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:05,247
I don't think there's
any great solutions here.

586
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:07,149
Dean...

587
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:09,818
Please? I can't.

588
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,526
All right.

589
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:20,329
If we do this -- <i>if...</i>

590
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:22,431
how do we get it done?

591
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:24,866
We need blood, live blood,

592
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:26,702
from the werewolf that bit her.

593
00:30:26,704 --> 00:30:29,471
Good. Great. Who we lookin' at?

594
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:32,441
Tribal tat.
Back at the bar.

595
00:30:32,443 --> 00:30:34,976
We shook him down about Claire,
and right after, she gets bit.

596
00:30:34,978 --> 00:30:36,478
That's not a coincidence.

597
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,581
Timeline fits,
connection to both victims.

598
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,183
Then we should go.

599
00:30:41,185 --> 00:30:42,851
The full moon rises
in less than an hour.

600
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:44,319
And if she turns and feeds,

601
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:46,655
our cheery success rate
drops to zero.

602
00:30:46,657 --> 00:30:48,590
Let's go.

603
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:50,058
Not you.

604
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,361
You stay with her.

605
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:55,664
You trust him?
Mick's a smart guy.

606
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:57,599
So when I say that
if anything happens to her,

607
00:30:57,601 --> 00:31:00,235
and I mean <i>anything...</i>
You'll kill me.

608
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:03,505
Like I said, smart.

609
00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:05,941
Sam, if you're not back...

610
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:07,609
We'll be back.

611
00:31:10,013 --> 00:31:13,248
?

612
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:25,527
Yo.

613
00:31:26,997 --> 00:31:29,464
All right, don't move,
don't move. It's silver.

614
00:31:34,104 --> 00:31:35,937
He's human.

615
00:31:42,546 --> 00:31:45,580
Let's give it time.

616
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:57,926
Aah! It burns!

617
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:08,136
?

618
00:32:15,412 --> 00:32:18,547
You don't understand.
It's happening!

619
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:21,016
Give it to me!
No.

620
00:32:21,018 --> 00:32:22,684
Then you do it, please!
It's happening!

621
00:32:22,686 --> 00:32:25,387
And you don't understand
how this feels!

622
00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:32,194
I know a man who would
shoot you right now

623
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:34,529
without a moment's thought.

624
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:38,300
And every instinct I have
says he's right...

625
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,203
that I ought to do my duty.

626
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:43,305
But...

627
00:32:46,577 --> 00:32:50,245
But my instincts haven't
been so grand of late.

628
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:55,250
Sit down.

629
00:33:02,192 --> 00:33:05,494
Now okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

630
00:33:05,496 --> 00:33:08,864
Firstly, we're gonna
restrain you, right?

631
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:11,399
For my protection. Okay?

632
00:33:11,401 --> 00:33:14,035
And then...

633
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:16,071
then we're gonna sedate you.

634
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:18,940
Also for my protection.

635
00:33:18,942 --> 00:33:22,544
With any luck, when you wake up,
this will all be over.

636
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,779
<i>If</i> I wake up.

637
00:33:26,717 --> 00:33:30,118
I gotta call Jody.

638
00:33:35,025 --> 00:33:38,760
She's gonna be
so mad at me.

639
00:33:38,762 --> 00:33:41,963
Claire, get back!

640
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:44,032
Aah!

641
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:05,188
Claire?

642
00:34:07,192 --> 00:34:09,025
Where is she?

643
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:10,726
The wolf, he took her.

644
00:34:10,728 --> 00:34:12,195
What did I tell you?!

645
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:15,231
I tried to stop him, okay?

646
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:16,999
I can find her.

647
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,268
I put a tracker
in her pocket.

648
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,703
You planted a bug on her?

649
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:25,107
Look, you can kill me later,
after we find Claire.

650
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:30,279
?

651
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:37,853
I know this is sudden,

652
00:34:37,855 --> 00:34:39,989
but you and your friends, you
should've let me have Hayden.

653
00:34:39,991 --> 00:34:43,226
She was miserable here.
She...

654
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:44,827
We had big plans.

655
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:47,863
Yeah? Was that before or after
you bit her?

656
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:50,066
I had to know if she could
survive the change.

657
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,467
Not everyone does.

658
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:55,738
See?

659
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,441
It hurts at first,
but eventually,

660
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:01,611
it's like the best drug ever
times a thousand.

661
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:04,146
Right. Eat me, Teen Wolf.

662
00:35:04,148 --> 00:35:06,515
It's not like
I <i>want</i> to do this.

663
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:09,418
My pack, we were happy.
We didn't hurt anyone.

664
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,520
And then hunters with weapons
that I've never seen before,

665
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:14,557
they show up and...
Ah!

666
00:35:16,427 --> 00:35:19,262
...take out 20 of us,
just like that.

667
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:20,763
The ones that made it,
we split up,

668
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:22,231
but we weren't meant
to live like that.

669
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:23,933
A werewolf needs his pack.

670
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:29,605
You'll see, I'm a nice guy.

671
00:35:29,607 --> 00:35:32,108
Yeah? You know who says
they're a nice guy?

672
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,478
Clingy, insecure bitches
with mommy issues.

673
00:35:37,048 --> 00:35:39,382
That's just the change
talking.

674
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:41,651
You'll feel better once you eat.

675
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:50,693
Try it. You'll like it.

676
00:35:52,563 --> 00:35:55,531
As soon as I saw you, I knew...

677
00:35:57,669 --> 00:35:59,435
you're just like me.

678
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:00,870
Alone.

679
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:06,776
Wrong.

680
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:10,546
I have a family,
and they love me.

681
00:36:12,116 --> 00:36:13,649
Aah!

682
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,130
Claire?

683
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:29,965
Claire.

684
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:33,302
Hey, all right. Easy.

685
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:34,561
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Oh!

686
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:39,075
Mick, hurry!

687
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:42,211
Aah!

688
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:50,086
Ah! Sorry, kid.

689
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:17,279
?

690
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:25,921
Move, move, move, move, move.

691
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:31,260
Claire. Claire.

692
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:35,965
Okay, Claire, it's us.
You know us.

693
00:37:36,032 --> 00:37:37,261
That thing ready yet?

694
00:37:37,285 --> 00:37:39,285
It's ready. It's ready.
Go, go, go.

695
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:42,071
She wanted this, right?
Oh, yeah.

696
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:47,143
Ah!

697
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:21,226
Gonna get some air.

698
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:42,581
Claire?

699
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:50,789
Dean.

700
00:38:56,831 --> 00:39:00,065
?

701
00:39:21,455 --> 00:39:25,624
?

702
00:39:28,395 --> 00:39:30,929
You guys look like crap.

703
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,006
?

704
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:42,975
All right, give this to you.

705
00:39:47,314 --> 00:39:49,448
That girl is a walking miracle.

706
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,016
Yes, she is.

707
00:39:53,254 --> 00:39:56,855
Listen, uh...thanks for
the win back there.

708
00:39:56,857 --> 00:39:58,257
Yeah.

709
00:39:58,259 --> 00:40:01,493
So we're good?
Not quite,

710
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:03,896
but we'll give you
a second chance.

711
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:07,900
Just don't mess it up.
There won't be a third.

712
00:40:07,902 --> 00:40:09,601
Okay.

713
00:40:09,603 --> 00:40:11,570
Hey. How you feeling?

714
00:40:11,572 --> 00:40:13,272
Honestly?

715
00:40:13,274 --> 00:40:15,908
I'm sort of craving
a Milk-Bone right now.

716
00:40:20,014 --> 00:40:22,014
Look, um...

717
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,916
what I said before...

718
00:40:23,918 --> 00:40:25,484
you guys are here
when I need you

719
00:40:25,486 --> 00:40:27,119
and that's all that matters.

720
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:28,987
You gonna tell Jody
what happened?

721
00:40:28,989 --> 00:40:31,590
I don't know.

722
00:40:31,592 --> 00:40:35,193
Well, whatever you decide,
we got your back.

723
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:44,636
<i>Leave</i>
<i>a message after the tone.</i>

724
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:47,039
Hey.

725
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:49,374
It's me, Claire.

726
00:40:50,978 --> 00:40:55,280
Okay, um, here it goes.

727
00:40:55,282 --> 00:40:58,750
<i>I've been hunting. Alone.</i>

728
00:40:58,752 --> 00:41:01,353
<i>And I know it's not</i>
<i>what you want to hear.</i>

729
00:41:02,823 --> 00:41:05,657
And I know it sounds scary.

730
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:09,027
It scares me, too, sometimes,
but...

731
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:12,598
this is something
I have to do on my own.

732
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,267
Just for a little while.

733
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:18,470
But I'm ready,

734
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:20,339
and I never would've been

735
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:22,941
if it wasn't for you
being my mother.

736
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:27,145
Well, I better go. Um...

737
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:29,648
Tell Alex she better not
touch my stuff.

738
00:41:31,518 --> 00:41:33,251
I love you guys.

739
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:43,362
<i>? I'm a wild one ?</i>

740
00:41:43,364 --> 00:41:46,031
<i>? Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one ?</i>

741
00:41:46,033 --> 00:41:49,534
<i>? Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>I'm a wild one ?</i>

742
00:41:49,536 --> 00:41:52,070
<i>? Gotta break it loose,</i>
<i>gonna keep 'em movin' wild ?</i>

743
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:56,642
<i>? Gonna keep a-swingin', baby,</i>
<i>I'm a real wild child ?</i>

744
00:41:56,737 --> 00:42:03,537
