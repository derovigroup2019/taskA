1
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:05,296
Lilith was the final seal.

2
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:08,424
I killed her and I set Lucifer free.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,928
You chose a demon
over your own brother.

4
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:13,804
I just don't think I can trust you.

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,726
You think I'll take one look at
a demon and fall off the wagon...

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,562
...as if, after everything,
I haven't learned my lesson.

7
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:23,189
Well, have you?

8
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:28,569
- I know you don't trust me.
- What are you saying?

9
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:30,613
Maybe it's best
we go our separate ways.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,822
I think you're right.

11
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,741
- You know who I am.
- Lucifer.

12
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,077
You're the one, Sam.
You're my vessel.

13
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,662
That'll never happen.

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,705
- Ah!
- You're the Michael Sword.

15
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:41,499
- What?
- You're Michael's weapon.

16
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,627
- I'm a vessel?
- You're the vessel.

17
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:46,087
You want back in.

18
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,922
- I won't let you down.
- I know it.

19
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,474
What's so important
you couldn't tell me over the phone?

20
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,978
Trust me, Jim. It's important.

21
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:06,107
Wait a minute. You're not...?

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,651
- You're not telling me that this is...?
- Yep.

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,778
You found it?

24
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,242
Oh...

25
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,330
You found it.

26
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,460
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,463
You sure?

28
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,924
The numbers match.

29
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,011
How much did you pay?

30
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,096
- A lot.
- Come on, how much?

31
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,683
- A lot.
- I bet.

32
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,395
Phew.

33
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,399
Wow.

34
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,320
- You start her up yet?
- Been waiting for you.

35
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:55,406
- Yeah, waiting to rub my nose in it.
- Exactly.

36
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,325
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

37
00:01:57,491 --> 00:01:59,577
We need to record this
for posterity's sake.

38
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:02,496
- Great idea.
- Yeah, great idea.

39
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:05,041
Oh, man.

40
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,548
<i>They're only three games behind...</i>

41
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,644
Cal?

42
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,146
Cal?

43
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,982
Hey, you all right, man?

44
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,527
I thought I heard something.

45
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:34,695
Cal?

46
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,157
Is something wrong?

47
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,165
Oh, my God. Cal.

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,795
Cal!

49
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,485
So, what's with this job?

50
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,988
Dude suffers a head-on collision
in a parked car?

51
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:19,657
- I'd say it's worth checking out.
- Yeah, definitely.

52
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,785
But we got bigger problems,
don't you think?

53
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,664
I'm sure the Apocalypse
will still be there when we get back.

54
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,794
Right, yeah. But I mean, if the Colt
is really out there somewhere...

55
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,922
We've been looking for three weeks.
We got bupkis.

56
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,509
Okay. But, Dean...

57
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,721
I mean, if we're gonna ice the devil...

58
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:45,683
This is what we're doing, okay?
End of discussion.

59
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:56,819
It's just that this is our first real case
back at it together.

60
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:01,115
You know, I think we ought to ease
into it. Put the training wheels back on.

61
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,826
- So you think I need training wheels?
- No, "we."

62
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,788
We need training wheels.
You and me, as a team.

63
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,665
Okay?

64
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,752
Okay.

65
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:20,092
I really want this to be a fresh start,
you know? For the both of us.

66
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,018
Okay.

67
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,449
Agents Bonham and Copeland.

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,535
Rick Carnegie. Good to know you.

69
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:48,579
- You're here on Cal Hopkins' death?
- That's right.

70
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,750
Afraid you came a long way for nothing.
We already booked the guy that did it.

71
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,419
I'm sorry. Who do you think did it?

72
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,297
<i>Cal? Is something wrong?</i>

73
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,803
<i>Oh, my God, Cal. Cal!</i>

74
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,600
Sicko taped his own handiwork.

75
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,522
- I don't follow.
- It was Jim Grossman that killed Cal.

76
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,023
Wait, what?

77
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,902
- Well, he was the only one on the scene.
- They were best friends.

78
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,155
Most violent crime are committed
by someone close to the victim.

79
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,950
And how, exactly,
did Jim slam Cal into a windshield...

80
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,328
...with all the force
of an 80-mile-per-hour crash?

81
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,456
Drugs, maybe?

82
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,585
Look, you know this ain't
brain surgery, boys.

83
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:39,714
Whatever it looks like,
that's what it usually is. It's simple.

84
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,758
Simple. Right.

85
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,596
Right. If you don't mind, we'd like
to speak to Jim Grossman anyway.

86
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:49,473
I was in the house when it happened.
Didn't even see it.

87
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,726
For argument's sake,
say we believe you.

88
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,520
- Why? The cops didn't.
- We're not your typical cops.

89
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,397
Please, just tell us what you saw.

90
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,066
It's not what I saw, it's what I heard.

91
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:03,112
Tyres squealing, glass breaking.

92
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,032
It was the car that did it.

93
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,285
The car?

94
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,288
I heard about the curse,
I thought it was a load of crap.

95
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,998
Curse? What do you mean curse?

96
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,375
The car. Little Bastard.

97
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,837
Li...? Little Bastard?

98
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,214
As in the Little Bastard?

99
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,633
- What's Little Bastard?
- It's James Dean's car.

100
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,177
- The one he was killed in.
- Yeah, that's the one.

101
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,764
Cal had been looking for it for years.
I mean, hell, we both had.

102
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,975
But he found it first.

103
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,313
We are definitely checking this out.

104
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,780
So what? This is like Christine?

105
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,491
<i>Well, Christine is fiction. This...</i>

106
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,701
This is real.

107
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,664
Okay, enlighten me.

108
00:06:55,331 --> 00:07:00,378
After James Dean died, his mechanic
bought the wreckage and he fixed it up.

109
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,173
And it repaid him by falling on him.

110
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,426
Then Tony McHenry was killed
when it locked up on the racetrack.

111
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,054
I mean, death follows this car around
like exhaust.

112
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,765
Nobody touches it
and comes away in one piece.

113
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,229
<i>Then in 1970,
it vanished off the back of a truck.</i>

114
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,107
Nobody's ever seen it since.

115
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,901
I'm telling you, man,
if this car is Little Bastard...

116
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,280
...I will bet you dollars to doughnuts
it's what killed the guy.

117
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,656
So how do we find out?

118
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,659
Cal matched the VIN number
but the only real way to know...

119
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,578
...is the engine number.

120
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,499
- I'm guessing the engine number...
- On the engine, yeah.

121
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,925
- You want me to do it?
- No.

122
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,803
No, no. I've got it.

123
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,853
Okay, baby, I'm not gonna hurt you...

124
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,522
...so don't hurt me.

125
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,882
Need a flashlight?

126
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,843
No.

127
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:35,223
Don't do anything. Just go away.

128
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,600
- Okay.
- Don't speak, all right?

129
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,895
In fact, don't even look at her.
She might not like it.

130
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,413
Jeez.

131
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,433
Find out who owned it.

132
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:24,063
Not just the last owner, you gotta
take it all the way back to 1955.

133
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,065
That's a lot of research.

134
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,944
Well, I guess
I just made your afternoon.

135
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,577
- So you wanna be an actress, huh?
- Yeah.

136
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:42,707
That is so funny,
because I am actually an agent...

137
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,169
...for William Morris Endeavor.
- Wow.

138
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,465
- You mind filling me up again?
- Yeah.

139
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,593
Thanks. Hey, you're a star.

140
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:55,928
<i>- Yo.
- Hey.</i>

141
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,639
Took me a while,
I traced the car's previous owners.

142
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,310
- Any of them die bloody?
- Nope. In fact...

143
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,312
Dean, are you in a bar?

144
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,315
No, I'm in a restaurant.

145
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,567
Here's your beer.

146
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,319
<i>Thanks.</i>

147
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,656
- That happens to have a bar.
- I've been working my ass off here.

148
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,658
Hey, world's smallest violin, pal.

149
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,953
I spent the afternoon up
Christine's skirt. I needed a drink.

150
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,747
- Actually, you didn't.
- Meaning?

151
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,791
The car's first owner was
a cardiologist in Philadelphia.

152
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,252
<i>Drove it till he died in 1972.</i>

153
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,504
So you're saying...

154
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,424
That Porsche is not,
nor has it ever been James Dean's car.

155
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,886
- It's a fake Little Bastard.
- Then what was it that killed the guy?

156
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,513
Good question.

157
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,771
Okay, Mr. Hill. I finished.

158
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,982
Thank you, Consuela.
Have a good night.

159
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,746
Oh, my God.

160
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,998
It's you.

161
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,085
You're dead.

162
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,087
You're supposed to be dead.

163
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,841
No.

164
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,848
No, no.

165
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,948
I want you to use a fine-tooth comb.

166
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,618
The evidence is here.
Just gotta find it.

167
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,495
Heard you got another weird one.

168
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,623
Well, it's a little strange
on the surface, I admit.

169
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,085
But, you know,
once you look at the facts...

170
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,172
William Hill died
from a gunshot wound to the head.

171
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,175
No gun, no gunpowder, no bullet.

172
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,968
Nope, nothing strange about that.

173
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,639
There's gotta be a reasonable
explanation. There always is.

174
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,642
Well, what's your reasonable
explanation?

175
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,853
Professional killer.

176
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,231
- Come again?
- Well, CIA, NSA.

177
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,109
<i>One of them trained assassins.
Like in Michael Clayton.</i>

178
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,907
Right.

179
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:26,120
Look, you're welcome to look around,
but these guys don't leave fingerprints.

180
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,581
- Mind if we talk with the witness?
- Be my guest.

181
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,082
She's not making any sense.

182
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,085
And she's not making any sense
in Spanish either.

183
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,504
Right.

184
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,016
- Consuela Alvarez?
- Yes.

185
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:52,021
FBI. Now, you said you saw something
in the professor's house, right?

186
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,314
Something in the window?

187
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,404
Se?ora Alvarez.

188
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,492
Uh...

189
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,040
- Nice.
- Freshman Spanish.

190
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:25,263
Okay, a tall man, very tall,
with a long black coat and a...

191
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,931
A beard? Beard.

192
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,059
Dude was wearing a sombrero?

193
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,311
A hat. Not a...

194
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,274
- A tall hat?
- Oh, like a top hat?

195
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,488
Oh, you mean like a stovepipe hat?

196
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,740
<i>- S?.
- Oh, yeah, like Abraham Lincoln.</i>

197
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,369
<i>S?. El Presidente Lincoln.</i>

198
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,374
Abraham Lincoln killed Mr. Hill.

199
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,085
Hm.

200
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,921
So I go home now?

201
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,883
<i>- S?. Gracias.
- Gracias.</i>

202
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,071
Whoa.

203
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,157
What?

204
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,206
It's a freeze-frame
from Jim Grossman's video.

205
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,295
Am I crazy
or does that look like James Dean?

206
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,130
That looks like James Dean.

207
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:47,345
So we got Abraham Lincoln
and James Dean?

208
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,389
- Famous ghosts?
- Maybe.

209
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,724
Well, that's just silly.

210
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,229
No, actually there's a ton of lore
on famous ghosts.

211
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,606
More than the, you know
non-famous kinds.

212
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,816
I'm surprised
we haven't run into one.

213
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,361
Now we got two?
Two extremely pissed-off ghosts?

214
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,989
- Who are apparently ganking their fans.
- What do you mean?

215
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,660
Professor Hill was a Civil War nut.
He dug Lincoln.

216
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,829
And Cal must've been
a James Dean freak.

217
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,998
<i>He spent 17 years of his life
tracking down the guy's car.</i>

218
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,043
So you're saying
that we've got two super-famous...

219
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,839
...super-pissed-off ghosts
killing their super-fans?

220
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,552
That's what it looks like.

221
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,263
<i>That is muchos loco.</i>

222
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,725
<i>"Muy," not "muchos."</i>

223
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,813
The big question is,
what the hell are they doing here?

224
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,649
Yeah. Ghosts usually haunt
the places they lived.

225
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,694
I mean, I get Abraham Lincoln
at the White House.

226
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,405
Yeah, and James Dean at a racetrack.

227
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,490
But what the hell they doing in Canton?

228
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,502
You gotta be kidding me.

229
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,422
What?

230
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,387
You gotta be kidding me.

231
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,577
Dude, he's short.

232
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,621
Hey.

233
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,914
Gandhi was a great man.

234
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,458
Yeah, for a Smurf.

235
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,838
Okay. Sorry to keep you waiting.
This is our busiest time of year.

236
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,509
This is busy?

237
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,011
Well, not right now but it's early.

238
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,223
- It's 4:30.
- So, what can I do for you?

239
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,725
<i>Well, we are writing a piece
for Travel Magazine.</i>

240
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,687
Yeah, on how totally non-sucky
wax museums are.

241
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,440
That's fantastic, a little press.
Just what we need.

242
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,651
Great.
We're interested in a few exhibits.

243
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,153
Specifically Abraham Lincoln
and James Dean.

244
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,322
- Two of our most popular displays.
- Yeah?

245
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,158
- They bring in a lot of visitors?
- We have our regulars.

246
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:18,496
I don't suppose that William Hill and
Cal Hopkins were regulars, were they?

247
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,998
Yeah, as a matter of fact, they were.

248
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,836
I heard what happened to them.
It's tragic, just tragic.

249
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,129
That's not gonna be in the article,
is it?

250
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,673
No, no, no. Of course not.

251
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,718
You know, I gotta tell you,
that Lincoln is so lifelike.

252
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,889
I mean, you know, you can just
imagine him moving around.

253
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,642
You ever see anything like that?

254
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,229
- Uh... No.
- No?

255
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,481
Well, is there anything
you can think of...

256
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,735
...that would make your museum
unusual? You know, for the article.

257
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,446
I'll say. There isn't another place
like us anywhere.

258
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,948
How so?

259
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,284
Well, for one,
that's Honest Abe's real hat.

260
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,287
It is?

261
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,414
Almost like his remains.

262
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,377
I guess.

263
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,922
You wouldn't happen to have
any of James Dean's personal effects?

264
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,383
Yeah. Got his keychain.
I got a bunch of stuff.

265
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,553
Gandhi's bifocals, FDR's iron lung.

266
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,054
This.

267
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:19,932
Who did that belong to?

268
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,019
The Fonz. Seasons two through four.

269
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,106
Well, wow.
Yeah, that's really cool-ish.

270
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,776
This? This is nothing. I've been working
on a new collection of figures.

271
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,361
Stuff that will wow the kids.

272
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,113
- The kids?
- Yeah, Gen Y.

273
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,783
Computer games, cell phones, sexting.

274
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,702
They're just fads.

275
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,747
I'm gonna make wax museums
hip again.

276
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:09,148
Yeah, Abraham Lincoln and
James Dean. Can you believe that?

277
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,983
Why so kill crazy? I don't know.

278
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,736
Maybe the Apocalypse
has got him all hot and bothered.

279
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,821
Well, we all know whose fault that is.

280
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,324
Well, I'm sorry, but it's true.

281
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,039
I'll call you later. Bye.

282
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:26,332
What's going on?

283
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,252
- Did you get the trunk packed up?
- Yeah, trunk's packed.

284
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,837
- Who was on the phone?
- Bobby.

285
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,965
- And?
- Nothing.

286
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,718
So we're just gonna pretend
I didn't hear what I just heard?

287
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,304
Pretend or don't.
Whatever floats your boat.

288
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,890
This was supposed to be a fresh start,
Dean.

289
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,017
Well, this is about as fresh as it gets.

290
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,228
Now, we going or not?

291
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,097
Check it out.

292
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,184
Four score and seven years ago...

293
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,770
...I had a funny hat.
- Dean.

294
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,439
I can't have any fun with this?

295
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:35,318
Let's just torch the objects, torch
the ghosts, get out of here, okay?

296
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,195
I'll grab East of Eden's keychain.

297
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,866
Dean?

298
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,954
Dean.

299
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,787
- Dean.
- Is that Gandhi?

300
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,956
- Yeah.
- Dude, he's squirrely.

301
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,833
Get... Get the...

302
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,629
Get the what?

303
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,423
Glasses.

304
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:40,342
You couldn't have been a fan
of someone cool?

305
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,555
Really? Gandhi?

306
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,232
You ready to blow this joint?

307
00:22:55,399 --> 00:23:00,905
Dean, didn't it strike you as strange
the way Gandhi just vanished?

308
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,741
- Strange how?
- No screaming, no big flameout.

309
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:06,076
I mean, that isn't the way
ghosts usually go.

310
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:08,078
Still, I torched, he vanished.

311
00:23:08,245 --> 00:23:14,251
Yeah, but... Also, I feel like
he was trying to take a bite out of me.

312
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:16,670
- A bite?
- Yeah, like he was hungry.

313
00:23:16,837 --> 00:23:20,132
But the thing is, Gandhi...
Or the real Gandhi.

314
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,176
He was a...

315
00:23:22,343 --> 00:23:24,053
A what?

316
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:26,972
Spit it out.

317
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,307
He was a fruitarian.

318
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:34,605
Let me get this straight.

319
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:37,983
Your ultimate hero
was not only a short man in diapers...

320
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,194
...but he was also a fruitarian?

321
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:43,614
- That's not the point.
- That is good. Even for you, that's good.

322
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,450
I'm just saying,
I'm not so sure this thing is over.

323
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:48,327
It was a ghost.

324
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:52,122
It was a weirdly supercharged
fruitarian ghost, but it was still a ghost.

325
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:53,999
Now, let's go.

326
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,711
So first you drag me into town
and now you're dragging me back out?

327
00:23:57,878 --> 00:24:01,674
You ain't steering this boat.
Let's go. Chop-chop.

328
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,384
You know, this isn't gonna work.

329
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,554
- What isn't?
- Us.

330
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:10,349
You, me, together.
I thought it could, but it can't.

331
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,560
You're the one that wanted back in,
chief.

332
00:24:12,726 --> 00:24:14,603
You're the one who called me back in.

333
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,939
I still think we got trust building to do.

334
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:19,692
How long am I gonna be
on double-secret probation?

335
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,860
Till I say so.

336
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:25,698
Look, I know what I did.
What I've done.

337
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,117
And I'm trying
to climb out of that hole. I am.

338
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:32,371
- But you're not making it any easier.
- I'm supposed to let you off the hook?

339
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:36,041
No. You can think whatever you want.
I deserve it and worse.

340
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,712
Hell, you'll never punish me
as much as I'm punishing myself.

341
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:44,425
But the point is,
if we're gonna be a team, you and I...

342
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:46,510
...it has to be a two-way street.

343
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,555
We go back
to the way we were before?

344
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,725
No, because we were never that way
before. Before didn't work.

345
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,476
How do you think we got here?

346
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,021
What's that supposed to mean?

347
00:24:57,187 --> 00:25:00,107
Dean, one of the reasons
I went off with Ruby...

348
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:03,694
...was to get away from you.

349
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,863
What?

350
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,867
It made me feel strong.
Like I wasn't your kid brother.

351
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:13,329
Are you saying this is my fault?

352
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:15,164
No, it's my fault.

353
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:17,791
All I'm saying
is that if we're gonna do this...

354
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:22,129
...we have to do it different.
We can't just fall into the same rut.

355
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:23,964
What do you want me to do?

356
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,259
You're gonna have to let me grow up,
for starters.

357
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:39,939
Yeah.

358
00:25:43,984 --> 00:25:46,862
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

359
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:52,451
I guess you were right
about this not being over.

360
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:01,168
- Sheriff Carnegie?
- Sheriff, what happened?

361
00:26:01,335 --> 00:26:03,379
I, uh...

362
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:05,881
I don't know.

363
00:26:11,095 --> 00:26:15,558
- Excuse us, girls. Hi, we're with the FBI.
- Can you tell us what happened?

364
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,811
- It was horrible.
- Way horrible.

365
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,355
- What was horrible?
- I thought she'd be nice.

366
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:23,023
I still can't believe it.

367
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,526
- Believe what?
- She took Danielle.

368
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:27,653
Who?

369
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:32,408
It's okay, you're safe.
Just tell us, who took your friend?

370
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,287
It was Paris Hilton.

371
00:26:38,372 --> 00:26:40,291
- Sorry?
- She looked really good though.

372
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:42,209
- Skinny.
- Skinny and fast.

373
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,962
Wha...? Huh?

374
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:48,382
Where did they go?

375
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:51,010
- We don't know.
- They just vanished.

376
00:26:51,427 --> 00:26:54,763
Would you excuse us
for just a minute?

377
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:58,726
Paris Hilton's
not dead as far as we know, right?

378
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:00,102
Pretty sure, no.

379
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:03,063
- Which means it's not a...?
- Ghost. No.

380
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,566
So either Paris Hilton
is a homicidal maniac...

381
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,651
Or we missed something.

382
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:09,987
What do you wanna do?

383
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:35,387
That's ripe.

384
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:55,449
What the hell?

385
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:01,455
- I can't believe I missed it.
- Missed what?

386
00:28:01,622 --> 00:28:03,374
I went back over the other two vics.

387
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,877
- There was blood loss, major.
- Being a gory smear will do that to you.

388
00:28:07,044 --> 00:28:10,881
No, more blood loss than a car crash or a
head wound should cause. Almost like...

389
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:12,383
- Something's feeding.
- Yeah.

390
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:15,135
- Awesome.
- And then there were these.

391
00:28:18,055 --> 00:28:21,517
- What are those, seeds?
- Yeah, they were in both vics' bellies.

392
00:28:21,684 --> 00:28:23,102
I hope you washed your hands.

393
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:26,438
They're unlike any other seed
I've ever seen before, Dean.

394
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:29,733
Wow, just when I thought
you couldn't get any geekier.

395
00:28:39,702 --> 00:28:41,203
Yahtzee.

396
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,372
- What?
- The seeds aren't from around here.

397
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,417
In fact, they're not from any tree
or plant in the country.

398
00:28:46,584 --> 00:28:48,377
- Where are they from?
- Eastern Europe.

399
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:51,130
A forest in the Balkans
which is not there anymore.

400
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,090
It was chopped down
like 30 years ago.

401
00:28:53,257 --> 00:28:56,260
- So?
- So local legend has it...

402
00:28:56,427 --> 00:29:00,055
...that the forest was guarded
by a pagan god whose name was Leshii.

403
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:02,850
A mischievous god.
Could take on infinite forms.

404
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:05,936
And let me guess,
he liked to munch on his fans.

405
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,899
Yep. "Could be appeased only
with the blood from his worshippers."

406
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:13,193
It would drain them, then
stuff their stomachs with the seeds.

407
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,237
How does he do it?

408
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,157
What, he touches
James Dean's keychain...

409
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,618
...and then morphs into James Dean?

410
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,663
Hm. As good a guess as any.

411
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:27,875
Yeah, well, whatever.
How do we kill him?

412
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:31,420
Says here to chop off his head
with an iron axe.

413
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:36,133
All right.
Let's go gank ourselves a Paris Hilton.

414
00:30:52,626 --> 00:30:54,295
Hey.

415
00:30:55,838 --> 00:30:57,715
She alive?

416
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,883
Yeah, barely.

417
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:17,568
Awesome.

418
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:59,526
Oh, I'm so glad you're awake for this.

419
00:31:59,693 --> 00:32:02,196
This is gonna be huge.

420
00:32:05,783 --> 00:32:08,285
Super. I wouldn't wanna miss it.

421
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:12,164
I mean, I've been stuffing myself
with fast food lately.

422
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:14,833
So it's nice to do the ritual right.

423
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:17,711
Prepare a nice slow meal for a change.

424
00:32:18,254 --> 00:32:20,881
Just like the good old days, huh?

425
00:32:21,048 --> 00:32:24,593
You have no idea. People adored me.

426
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,764
They used to throw themselves at me
with smiles on their faces.

427
00:32:29,723 --> 00:32:34,520
I guess these days nobody gives a crap
about some backwoods forest god, huh?

428
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:42,361
No, not since they cut down my forest
and built a Yugo plant.

429
00:32:43,112 --> 00:32:44,572
The march of progress, sister.

430
00:32:44,738 --> 00:32:48,075
For years now, I've been wandering.

431
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:50,452
Hungry. Scared.

432
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:53,247
Scrounging for scraps.

433
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:54,748
So not sexy.

434
00:32:55,791 --> 00:33:00,129
But then,
the best thing ever happened.

435
00:33:00,296 --> 00:33:03,173
Someone tripped the Apocalypse,
and I thought:

436
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,425
What the hell?

437
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:06,927
I'm tired of watching what I eat.

438
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:09,221
I wanna pig out.

439
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:13,475
So I found this little place.
It's awesome.

440
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:16,020
Adoring fans stroll right in the door.

441
00:33:16,478 --> 00:33:19,023
Yeah, but they're not your fans.

442
00:33:19,189 --> 00:33:23,277
So? They worship Lincoln,
Gandhi, Hilton.

443
00:33:23,444 --> 00:33:26,071
Whatever. I'll take what I can get.

444
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,575
You know, I gotta tell you,
you are not the first god we've met.

445
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:33,537
- But you are the nuttiest.
- No, you. You people.

446
00:33:33,704 --> 00:33:35,164
You're the crazy ones.

447
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:39,710
You used to worship gods. But this?

448
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:44,256
This is what passes for idolatry?
Celebrities?

449
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:47,176
What have they got besides small dogs
and spray tans?

450
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:51,138
You people used to have
old-time religion.

451
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:52,848
<i>Now you have Us Weekly.</i>

452
00:33:53,474 --> 00:33:56,143
<i>I don't know. I'm more of a
Penthouse Forum man myself.</i>

453
00:34:00,022 --> 00:34:02,066
Maybe.

454
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:05,861
But there's still a lot of yummy meat
on those bones, boy.

455
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:12,243
I hate to break it to you, sister,
but you can't eat me.

456
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:15,579
See, I'm not a Paris Hilton BFF.

457
00:34:15,746 --> 00:34:18,832
<i>I've never even seen House of Wax.</i>

458
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,504
No. But I can totally read your mind,
Dean.

459
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:26,548
I know who your hero is. Your daddy.

460
00:34:27,174 --> 00:34:29,718
Am I right?

461
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:33,556
And this belonged to him.

462
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:37,601
Didn't it? Poor little Dean.

463
00:34:37,768 --> 00:34:40,646
All you ever wanted
was to be loved by your idol.

464
00:34:41,772 --> 00:34:44,066
One distant father figure,
coming right up.

465
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,687
- Not a word.
- Dude.

466
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:25,900
You just got whaled on by Paris Hilton.

467
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,818
Shut up.

468
00:35:35,743 --> 00:35:37,369
Uh-huh.

469
00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:41,373
All right. Thank you.

470
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:45,419
Sheriff Carnegie.
Danielle's gonna be all right.

471
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:48,297
<i>She's sworn off The Simple Life,
but other than that...</i>

472
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:49,965
Glad she's okay.

473
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:51,425
It gets better.

474
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:54,637
The sheriff's putting out an APB
on Paris Hilton. Heh, heh.

475
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:56,889
That ought to be good.

476
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:05,689
Listen, I was thinking
about what you said yesterday.

477
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:08,859
About me keeping
too tight of a leash on you.

478
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,070
Maybe you're right.

479
00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:16,617
I mean, I'm not exactly Mr. Innocent
in this whole mess either, you know.

480
00:36:16,784 --> 00:36:18,118
I did break the first seal.

481
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:20,412
- You didn't know.
- Yeah, neither did you.

482
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,792
I'm not saying demon blood was
a great way to go but you did kill Lilith.

483
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:27,836
- And start the Apocalypse.
- Which neither of us saw coming.

484
00:36:28,003 --> 00:36:31,257
Who would've thought killing Lilith
would've been a bad thing?

485
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:36,929
Point is, I was so worried
about watching your every move...

486
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:39,932
...that I didn't see
what it was actually doing to you.

487
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:43,602
So for that, I'm sorry.

488
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:46,689
Thanks.

489
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:51,944
Where do we go from here?

490
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:54,446
The way I see it,
we got one shot at surviving.

491
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,615
- What's that?
- I am on deck for the devil.

492
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:59,285
Same with you and Michael.
There's no changing that.

493
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,661
Well, that's encouraging.

494
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:03,539
But we can stop
wringing our hands over it.

495
00:37:03,706 --> 00:37:07,876
We gotta grab whatever's in front of
us, kick its ass, and go down fighting.

496
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,300
- I can get on board with that.
- Okay.

497
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,969
But we're gonna have to do it
on the same level.

498
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:22,057
You got it.

499
00:37:27,062 --> 00:37:30,190
- What do you say we get out of here?
- Hell, yeah.

500
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:32,985
Hey.

501
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,784
You wanna drive?

502
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:44,747
You sure?

503
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:48,500
Yeah. I could... I could use a nap.

504
00:38:20,616 --> 00:38:22,368
- You ready?
- Hit it, Mr. Wizard.

505
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:25,788
Oh!

506
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:27,331
Nutcracker!

507
00:38:33,295 --> 00:38:34,713
Hey, Sam. What's happening?

508
00:38:35,422 --> 00:38:37,007
Just the end of the world.

509
00:38:38,634 --> 00:38:40,719
- Stay away from me.
- Mrs. Wright, wait.

510
00:38:42,805 --> 00:38:45,140
- You're not demons?
- How'd you know about demons?

511
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:47,685
This child is half-demon and half-human.

512
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:49,520
It's far more powerful than either.

513
00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:52,940
One word.

514
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:56,777
This child will destroy
the host of heaven.

515
00:38:56,944 --> 00:38:59,613
And I can't take that chance.

516
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,252
Poker. You play for years.

517
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:14,545
That's 25 years.

518
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:16,505
- You sure?
- Yes.

519
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,803
Who the hell are you?

520
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,765
- Dude, relax, it's me.
- Dean?

521
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:29,226
I see you met John McCain here.

522
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:40,946
Ow!

523
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:53,626
Well, I say jackpot.
