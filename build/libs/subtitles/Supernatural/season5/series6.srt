1
00:00:03,235 --> 00:00:06,837
You chose a demon over your
own brother and look what happened.

2
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:11,041
I did it. I started the Apocalypse,
and I set Lucifer free.

3
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:17,392
- I'm sorry. I would give anything to take it all back.
- I know you would.

4
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:21,218
If we're gonna be a team,
it has to be a two-way street.

5
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:25,055
We gotta just grab on to whatever's in front
of us, kick its ass, and go down fighting.

6
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:27,556
I can get onboard with that.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,300
Go!

8
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:52,783
Come on, get out of there.

9
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:54,785
Yeah, go on. Go.

10
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:18,507
Jimmy?

11
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:32,856
I told you to go to bed.

12
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:35,357
I can't. I'm dead.

13
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:37,961
What is this? Ketchup?

14
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:40,462
- Gross.
- Ow!

15
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:41,698
You're mean.

16
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:44,435
Yeah, that's what your parents
pay me for, to be mean.

17
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:45,936
- Bed, now.
- Okay, okay.

18
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:48,372
Just wait. Wait.

19
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:51,542
I'll go to bed
if you let me touch your boob.

20
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:54,043
Go.

21
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:47,524
I'll take Amber home. Don't wait up.

22
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:59,174
Amber?

23
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:02,444
Amber?

24
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:18,927
Francine!

25
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:28,438
Agents Page and Plant, FBl.

26
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,807
Gentlemen. What brings you by?

27
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:34,818
- We need to see Amber Greer's body.
- Really? What for?

28
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:39,343
The police report said something
clawed through her skull.

29
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:43,053
You didn't read the autopsy report
that I e-mailed out this morning?

30
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:45,989
We had server issues.

31
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:03,674
When they brought her in,
we thought she was attacked by a wolf.

32
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:07,042
- Or something.
But we were wrong.

33
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:12,282
- Is that-?
It's a press-on nail.

34
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:14,284
We found it in her temporal lobe.

35
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:15,586
Is that even possible?

36
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,754
You saying
that she did this to herself?

37
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:20,445
Uh-huh. She scratched her brains out.

38
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:25,195
It'd take hours and it'd hurt like hell,
but, sure, it's possible.

39
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:26,897
- How?
- Pick your acronym.

40
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:30,356
OCD, PCP, it all spells crazy.

41
00:04:30,568 --> 00:04:34,436
My guess?
Some kind of phantom itch.

42
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,273
I mean, an extreme case, but-

43
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:38,774
- Phantom itch?
- Yeah.

44
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:44,114
All it takes is someone
talking about an itch...

45
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:47,584
...or thinking about one,
and suddenly you can't stop scratching.

46
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:50,085
- Thanks, doc.
- Okay.

47
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:57,261
Okay, now, some of these questions
might seem a bit odd...

48
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:59,890
...but, please, just bear with me.

49
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:03,414
Have you noticed
any cold spots in the house?

50
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:04,901
- No.
Okay.

51
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:06,436
What about strange smells?

52
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:08,937
Smells?
Like, say...

53
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,540
What you looking for?

54
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:15,177
Don't know yet.

55
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:19,281
It's Jimmy, right?

56
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:24,478
- So Amber was your babysitter?
- Yes, sir.

57
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,658
Yeah, most of my babysitters sucked.

58
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:30,794
Especially Miss Chancey,
she only cared about two things:

59
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:33,295
Dynasty and bedtime.

60
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:40,644
- Did you see anything strange that night?
- No, sir.

61
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:44,007
You sure about that?

62
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:47,377
I would tell you if I knew something.
I promise.

63
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:49,878
A hundred percent, cross my heart.

64
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:56,479
Well, Jimmy,
I happen to know you're lying.

65
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:59,188
I'm not.

66
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:11,207
We gonna start talking truth, or are you
and me gonna take a trip downtown?

67
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:15,138
Kid said he put this
on the babysitter's hairbrush.

68
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,475
Dean, no way itching powder
made that girl scratch her brains out.

69
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:20,177
It's just ground-up maple seeds.

70
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:22,679
You have any another theories,
I'm open to them.

71
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:27,816
Yeah?

72
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,619
Yeah, we'll be right there.

73
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:35,753
Dr. Norris.

74
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:38,427
Dr. Norris.

75
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:39,730
What happened?

76
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:41,064
Guy got electrocuted.

77
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:42,265
Any idea how?

78
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:46,036
Maybe a loose wire
or a piece of equipment shorted out.

79
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:47,871
So far, we haven't found anything.

80
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:49,439
- Witnesses?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,007
Guy in there, Mr. Stanley.

82
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:54,411
He says he saw it,
but he's not making a lick of sense.

83
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:57,074
- Senile.
- Thanks.

84
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:03,687
Mr. Stanley?

85
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:06,188
It was just a joke.

86
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,920
I didn't know it would really work.

87
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,560
What would work?

88
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,194
All I did was shake his hand.

89
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:36,686
- You ready?
- Hit it, Mr. Wizard.

90
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:57,272
That'll do, pig.

91
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:00,809
What the hell?

92
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,816
- That crap isn't supposed to work.
- This thing doesn't even have batteries.

93
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:08,987
So, what?
Are we looking at cursed objects?

94
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,521
Sounds good.

95
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:15,083
Maybe there's
a powerful witch in town.

96
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:25,268
Is there any link between
the joy buzzer and the itching powder?

97
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:30,646
One was made in China, the other
in Mexico, bought from the same store.

98
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:47,556
Sam.

99
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:03,373
Welcome to the Conjurarium,
sanctum of magic and mystery.

100
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:07,069
- You the owner?
- Yep.

101
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:10,380
Sold any itching powder
or joy buzzers lately?

102
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:12,182
Yeah, grand total, one of each.

103
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:14,873
They aren't exactly big-ticket items.

104
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,185
Look, you boys here
to buy something, or what?

105
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:21,985
So you get many customers?

106
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,693
Kids come in.

107
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:26,930
They don't buy much, but they're
more than happy to break stuff.

108
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:29,599
These days,
all they care about are iPhones...

109
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,801
...and those kissing-vampire movies.

110
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:33,603
The whole thing makes me just-

111
00:09:33,604 --> 00:09:36,104
Angry?

112
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,840
Yeah. Yeah, I am angry.

113
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:43,747
This shop has been my life for 20 years,
and now it's wasting away to nothing.

114
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:46,616
- Which is why you hate them.
- I suppose.

115
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:48,385
You wish there was something
you could do.

116
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:49,686
Yeah, I guess I do.

117
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,187
So you're taking revenge...

118
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:55,957
...with this.

119
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:07,904
Yeah, something tells me
this guy is not a powerful witch.

120
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:10,533
Sorry. Sorry.

121
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:18,982
I'll just slip this tooth
under your pillow...

122
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:22,652
...and while you're asleep,
the tooth fairy will float down...

123
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:24,888
...and swap it out for a quarter.

124
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:30,339
Some freak is gonna come in my room
while I'm sleeping and take my tooth?

125
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:33,657
Sounds scary. No, thank you.

126
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:36,731
Come on.

127
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:48,677
Good night, sweetie.

128
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,564
Hold still,
you might feel just a little pinch.

129
00:11:57,915 --> 00:12:01,043
Well, I appreciate that,
Nurse Fremont.

130
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:03,519
Please, call me Jen.

131
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,020
Oh, Jen it is.

132
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,960
What's up with Toothless?

133
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,229
- Cavity Creeps get ahold of him?
- Close.

134
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:20,033
He wrote up a description: 5'10",
350 pounds, wings and a pink tutu.

135
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:23,806
- The tooth fairy.
- So he's whacked out on painkillers.

136
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:29,017
Maybe. It got past locked doors and
windows without triggering the alarm.

137
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:30,546
Come on, the tooth fairy?

138
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:33,897
And it left 32 quarters
underneath his pillow.

139
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:36,451
One for each tooth.

140
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:39,455
Well, I will see your crazy
and raise you some.

141
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:43,760
Kids upstairs with ulcers say they
got it from mixing Pop Rocks and Coke.

142
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:47,253
Another guy, his face froze that way.

143
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:51,099
What way?

144
00:12:57,574 --> 00:13:00,099
He held it too long and it stuck.

145
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,941
They're flying in a plastic surgeon.

146
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:06,584
So, I mean, if you add all that up...

147
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:11,319
I got nothing.

148
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:14,524
I thought Sea-Monkeys were real.

149
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:16,359
They are. They're brine shrimp.

150
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,294
No, no, no. I mean, like in the ads.

151
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:22,098
Like the Sea-Monkey wife cooks the
pot roast for the Sea-Monkey husband...

152
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:25,835
...and the Sea-Monkey kids play
with the dog in a Sea-Monkey castle.

153
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:27,036
Real.

154
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:29,272
- I mean, I was 6, but I believed it.
- Okay.

155
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:33,266
The point is,
maybe that's the connection.

156
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:35,778
The tooth fairy,
the Pop Rocks and Coke...

157
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,982
...the joy buzzer that shocks you,
all lies that kids believe.

158
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:41,017
And now they're coming true.

159
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:43,886
Okay, so whatever's doing this
is reshaping reality.

160
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:48,017
It has the powers of a god
or of a trickster.

161
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,609
And the sense of humor
of a 9-year-old.

162
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:54,762
Or you.

163
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:04,340
Dude, seriously? Still with the ham?

164
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:06,841
We don't have a fridge.

165
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:10,404
Well, I found something. Here.

166
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:14,784
Tooth fairy attack was here,
Pop Rocks and Coke was here...

167
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:18,054
...then you've got itching powder,
face freeze and joy buzzer.

168
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:20,390
All located within a two-mile radius.

169
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:24,394
So we got a blast zone of weird,
and inside, fantasy becomes reality.

170
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:27,864
- Looks like.
- And what's the A-bomb in the center?

171
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:31,699
Four acres of farmland and a house.

172
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,806
Our motel isn't in that circle,
by any chance?

173
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:39,833
Yeah, why?

174
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:48,717
Oh, dude.
That's not what I think it is, is it?

175
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:51,386
I got bored. That nurse was hot.

176
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:55,851
You know you can go
blind from that too.

177
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:59,916
Give me five minutes.
We'll go check out that house.

178
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:03,262
Hey. Do not use my razor.

179
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:42,572
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

180
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:44,307
What's your name?

181
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:46,808
Who wants to know?

182
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:50,974
The, ahem, FBl.

183
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,083
Let me see that.

184
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:58,086
So, what, you guys don't knock?

185
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:01,691
- Are your parents home?
- They work.

186
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:04,026
Well, you mind
if we ask you a few questions?

187
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:06,028
Maybe take a look around the house?

188
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,131
I don't know.

189
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:12,142
Come on, you can trust us, huh?
We're the authorities.

190
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:25,281
- What's that?
- It's called soup.

191
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:27,782
You heat it up and you eat it.

192
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:30,686
Right. I know.

193
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:33,187
It's just...

194
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:36,559
...I used to make dinner too,
when I was a kid.

195
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,060
Well, I'm not a kid.

196
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:42,063
Right. No, I know.

197
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:45,366
- I'm Robert, by the way.
- Jesse.

198
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:47,935
Jesse? Nice to meet you.

199
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:51,842
- Did you draw this?
- It's the tooth fairy.

200
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:55,344
That's what you think
the tooth fairy looks like, huh?

201
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:58,872
- Yeah. My dad told me about him.
- Huh.

202
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:02,652
What, didn't your dad
tell you about the tooth fairy?

203
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:05,153
My dad?

204
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,657
No. My dad told me different stories.

205
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:10,348
Well, the tooth fairy isn't a story.

206
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:15,031
What do you know
about itching powder?

207
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:19,035
- It will make you scratch your brains out.
- Pop Rocks and Coke?

208
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:24,066
You mix them and you'll end up
in the hospital. Everyone knows that.

209
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,544
- You shouldn't have that.
- Why not?

210
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:31,045
It can electrocute you.

211
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:34,050
Actually, it can't.

212
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:37,520
It's just a wind-up toy.
It's totally harmless.

213
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,222
Doesn't even have batteries.

214
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:40,590
So it can't shock you?

215
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:42,592
Nope. Not at all.

216
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:45,093
I swear.

217
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,130
Oh, okay.

218
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:53,603
All it does is just shake in your hand.
It's kind of lame. See?

219
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:01,118
What did you say
your name was again?

220
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:10,552
- Dude, what the hell?
- I had a hunch, I went with it.

221
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:12,587
You risked my ass on a hunch?

222
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:15,690
We know who's turning this town
into Willy Wonka's nightmare.

223
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:19,027
- The kid.
- Everything Jesse believes comes true.

224
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:23,198
He thinks the tooth fairy looks like
Belushi, joy buzzers really shock people.

225
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:27,602
Convince him that joy buzzers don't work,
and they go back into crap toys.

226
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:30,953
He probably doesn't even know
he's doing it.

227
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,910
How is he doing it?

228
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:48,786
So dug up what I could on Jesse Turner.
It's not much.

229
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:52,392
B student,
won last year's Pinewood Derby.

230
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:57,362
But get this: Jesse was adopted.
His birth records are sealed.

231
00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,234
So you unsealed them.

232
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:03,305
There's no father listed, but Jesse's
biological mom is named Julia Wright.

233
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:07,436
She lives in Elk Creek,
on the other side of the state.

234
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,003
Whatever you're selling,
I'm not interested.

235
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:38,940
Oh, we're not salesmen.
Agents Page and Plant, FBl.

236
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:47,741
Put your badge in the slot.
Your partner's too.

237
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:04,531
What do you want?

238
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:08,626
We just had a few questions
about your son.

239
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:12,305
I don't have a son.

240
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:16,302
He was born March 29th, 1998,
in Omaha.

241
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:19,546
You put him up for adoption.

242
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,984
What about him?

243
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:26,113
We were just wondering. Was it a-?

244
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:30,323
Was it a normal pregnancy?

245
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:33,828
- Was there anything strange?
- Stay away from me!

246
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:36,329
Mrs. Wright, wait.

247
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:42,702
We just wanna talk.

248
00:20:47,076 --> 00:20:49,344
You're not demons?

249
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:51,845
How do you know about demons?

250
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:59,452
I was possessed.

251
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:03,891
A demon took control of my body
and I hurt people.

252
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:07,028
I killed people.

253
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:08,863
That wasn't you.

254
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:11,232
But I was there.

255
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:14,134
I heard a woman beg for mercy.

256
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:17,893
I felt a young girl's blood
drip down my hands.

257
00:21:18,474 --> 00:21:20,308
That's how you knew about the salt.

258
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:23,478
Yeah, I picked up tricks.
It was in my head for months.

259
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:26,049
How many months?
Nine.

260
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:31,519
So your son...

261
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,548
Yeah, the whole time,
the pregnancy, birth...

262
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:39,226
...all of it...

263
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:43,164
...I was possessed.

264
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:47,869
The night the baby was born,
I was alone...

265
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,370
...and the pain was overwhelming.

266
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:56,839
I screamed, and it came out a laugh
because the demon was happy.

267
00:21:59,114 --> 00:22:02,777
It used my body
to give birth to a child.

268
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:12,861
When it was over, something changed,
maybe the demon was tired...

269
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:16,152
...or if the pain
helped me fight it, but...

270
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:19,899
...somehow I took control.

271
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:24,639
And the demon wailed inside me,
it pounded against my skull.

272
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,045
I thought my head
was gonna explode, but I knew.

273
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:34,714
I knew what I had to do.

274
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:51,432
- And when I was alone
with the baby, part of me-

275
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:53,933
Part of me wanted to kill it.

276
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:02,071
But God help me,
I couldn't do that...

277
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:06,908
...so I put it up for adoption and I ran.

278
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,583
Who was the father?

279
00:23:12,021 --> 00:23:14,521
I was a virgin.

280
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:20,093
Have you seen my son?

281
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:22,929
Is he human?

282
00:23:23,732 --> 00:23:26,232
His name is Jesse.

283
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:29,136
He lives in Alliance.

284
00:23:30,272 --> 00:23:32,772
He's a good kid.

285
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:37,946
So now what?

286
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:40,447
We need help.

287
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:51,292
I take it you got our message.

288
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:53,628
It's lucky you found the boy.

289
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:56,631
Oh, yeah, real lucky.
What do we do with him?

290
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:59,132
Kill him.

291
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:04,572
- Cass.
- This child is half-demon and half-human.

292
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:07,308
But it's far more powerful than either.

293
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:10,959
Other cultures call this hybrid
cambion, or Katako.

294
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,180
You know him as the Antichrist.

295
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:27,961
That wasn't me.

296
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:31,466
Who put that there?

297
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:35,003
Anyway, I don't get it.
Jesse is the devil's son?

298
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:37,138
No. Of course not.

299
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:39,540
Your Bible gets more wrong
than it does right.

300
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:43,778
The Antichrist is not Lucifer's child,
it's just demon spawn...

301
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:47,849
...but it is one of the devil's greatest
weapons in the war against heaven.

302
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,918
If Jesse's a demonic howitzer,
what's he doing in Nebraska?

303
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:54,489
The demons lost him, they can't
find him, but they're looking.

304
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,558
- And they lost him because...?
- Because of the child's power.

305
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:01,893
It hides him from both angels
and demons for now.

306
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:04,332
So he's got, like,
a force field around him.

307
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,843
Well, that's great. Problem solved.

308
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:09,637
With Lucifer risen,
this child grows strong.

309
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:13,508
Soon, he will do more than just
make a few toys come to life...

310
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:16,711
...something that will draw
the demons to him.

311
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:19,212
The demons will find this child.

312
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:22,817
Lucifer will twist this boy
to his purpose...

313
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:26,345
...and then, with a word, this child...

314
00:25:26,522 --> 00:25:29,514
...will destroy the host of heaven.

315
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:33,795
Wait, you're saying
that Jesse's gonna nuke the angels?

316
00:25:33,896 --> 00:25:36,396
We cannot allow that to happen.

317
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:42,735
Wait.

318
00:25:43,272 --> 00:25:46,982
We're the good guys.
We don't just kill children.

319
00:25:48,877 --> 00:25:54,213
A year ago, you would've done
whatever it took to win this war.

320
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:56,916
Things change.

321
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:04,225
Okay. Hey, look.
We are not going to kill him, all right?

322
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:06,861
But we can't leave Jesse here either.
We know that.

323
00:26:06,862 --> 00:26:10,730
So we take him to Bobby's,
he'll know what to do.

324
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:13,433
You'll kidnap him?

325
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:17,305
What is going on in this town, it's what
happens when this thing is happy.

326
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:21,016
You cannot imagine
what it will do if it's angry.

327
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,011
Besides, how will you hold him?

328
00:26:24,012 --> 00:26:27,902
With a thought,
he could be halfway around the world.

329
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,651
- So we-
- So we tell him the truth.

330
00:26:30,652 --> 00:26:34,555
You say Jesse's destined to go
dark side, fine, but he hasn't yet.

331
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:37,225
So if we lay it all out for him,
what he is...

332
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:41,596
...the Apocalypse, everything,
he might make the right choice.

333
00:26:48,036 --> 00:26:50,536
You didn't.

334
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,240
And I can't take that chance.

335
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:05,251
Damn it.

336
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:20,101
Sorry. Sorry.

337
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:22,170
- No worries. You okay?
- Yeah.

338
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:25,629
It's just, today, a little shaky.

339
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:29,677
Well, talking to the Winchesters
will do that to you.

340
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:32,476
Don't you recognize me, sweetheart?

341
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:35,516
We had so many great times together,
didn't we?

342
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:38,619
And then you stole something from us,
hid it away.

343
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,646
That was very, very naughty of you.

344
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:45,226
So we watched, and we waited...

345
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:49,129
...and now, they told you
where he is, didn't they?

346
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:52,621
I think it's time we go
and visit our son.

347
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:34,073
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

348
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:45,953
Mom! Dad!

349
00:28:45,954 --> 00:28:49,048
Your mother and father are sleeping.

350
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:52,548
I assure you,
they won't wake until morning.

351
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:01,033
I'm sorry.

352
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:11,412
Was there a guy here
in a trench coat?

353
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:43,344
Was he your friend?

354
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:45,346
Him?

355
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:47,847
No.

356
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:51,384
I did that.

357
00:29:52,054 --> 00:29:54,554
But how did I do that?

358
00:29:56,224 --> 00:29:58,225
You're a superhero.

359
00:29:58,226 --> 00:30:01,059
- I am?
- Yeah.

360
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:04,365
Yeah, I mean, who else
could turn someone into a toy?

361
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:08,894
You're Superman,
minus the cape and the go-go boots.

362
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:14,608
See, my partner and I...

363
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:17,445
...we work for
a secret government agency.

364
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:20,916
It's our job to find kids
with special powers.

365
00:30:21,283 --> 00:30:23,951
In fact, we're here to take you
to a hidden base...

366
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:27,888
...in South Dakota,
where you'll be trained to fight evil.

367
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:30,999
- Like the X-Men?
- Exactly like the X-Men.

368
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:36,163
In fact, the guy we're taking you to,
he's even in a wheelchair.

369
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:37,832
You'll be a hero.

370
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:40,201
You'll save lives, you'll get the girl.

371
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:42,702
Sounds like fun, right?

372
00:30:46,008 --> 00:30:48,508
They're lying to you.

373
00:30:51,313 --> 00:30:53,214
Stay right there, dreamboat.

374
00:30:53,215 --> 00:30:55,979
Can't hurt you. Orders.

375
00:30:56,184 --> 00:31:00,518
You, on the other hand,
hurting you is encouraged.

376
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:08,227
Leave him alone.

377
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,564
Jesse, you're beautiful.

378
00:31:13,435 --> 00:31:15,935
You have your father's eyes.

379
00:31:16,204 --> 00:31:18,704
- Who are you?
- I'm your mother.

380
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:21,175
No, you're not.

381
00:31:21,176 --> 00:31:25,203
You're half-human, half one of us.

382
00:31:25,447 --> 00:31:27,214
She means demons, Jesse.

383
00:31:32,387 --> 00:31:35,689
Those people you call your parents,
they lied to you too.

384
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,488
You're not theirs, not really.

385
00:31:39,728 --> 00:31:42,029
- My mom and dad love me.
Do they?

386
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,165
Is that why
they leave you alone all day?

387
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,233
Because they love you so much?

388
00:31:46,234 --> 00:31:47,835
These people...

389
00:31:47,836 --> 00:31:51,839
...these imposters, they told you
that the tooth fairy was real...

390
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,009
...and your toys could hurt you,
and things that aren't true.

391
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,140
They love you so much,
they made your whole life a lie.

392
00:32:00,348 --> 00:32:02,848
Look into your heart, Jesse.

393
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:04,852
You've always known
you weren't theirs.

394
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:07,254
You've always known
you were different.

395
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:09,755
Everyone has lied to you.

396
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:12,291
They're not FBl agents.

397
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:16,696
And you're not a superhero.

398
00:32:17,365 --> 00:32:19,900
- Then what am I?
- You're powerful.

399
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:23,370
You can have anything you want,
you can do anything you want.

400
00:32:23,371 --> 00:32:25,881
Don't listen to her, Jesse.

401
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:29,710
They treated you like a child. Nobody
trusted you, everybody's lied to you.

402
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:32,211
Doesn't that make you angry?

403
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:46,155
See? It does make you angry.

404
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:49,964
But I'm telling you the truth, Jesse.

405
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:53,234
Wouldn't it be better
if there were no lies?

406
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:55,336
Come with me.

407
00:32:55,337 --> 00:32:57,304
You can wash it all clean.

408
00:32:57,305 --> 00:32:58,772
Start over.

409
00:32:58,773 --> 00:33:02,436
Imagine it, a world without lies.

410
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:10,049
She's right. We lied to you.

411
00:33:10,252 --> 00:33:12,762
But I'll tell you the truth. Ugh!

412
00:33:13,355 --> 00:33:18,190
I just- Ugh! I just want to tell- Ugh!

413
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,860
Stop it.

414
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:23,496
I wanna hear what he has to say.

415
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:26,565
You're stronger than I thought.

416
00:33:29,337 --> 00:33:33,034
We lied to you, and I'm sorry.

417
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:35,643
So here's the truth.

418
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:39,876
I'm Sam Winchester,
that's my brother, Dean.

419
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:42,016
We hunt monsters.

420
00:33:42,017 --> 00:33:45,186
Except when you are the monster,
right, Sammy?

421
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:48,389
And that woman right there,
her name is Julia.

422
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,890
She's your mother.

423
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:55,396
But the thing inside of her,
the thing that you're talking to...

424
00:33:55,397 --> 00:33:56,630
...it's a demon.

425
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:59,600
- A demon?
He's done nothing but lie to you.

426
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:02,101
Don't listen to him, punish him.

427
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,670
Sit down and shut up.

428
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:15,372
There's kind of a war
between angels and demons...

429
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:18,245
...and you're a part of it.

430
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:21,655
I'm just a kid.

431
00:34:21,656 --> 00:34:23,924
You can go with her if you want.

432
00:34:23,925 --> 00:34:26,160
I can't stop you. No one can.

433
00:34:26,161 --> 00:34:30,188
But if you do,
millions of people will die.

434
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,000
She said I was half-demon.
Is that true?

435
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:36,994
Yes. But you're half-human too.

436
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,206
You can do the right thing.

437
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:41,275
You've got choices, Jesse...

438
00:34:41,276 --> 00:34:46,413
...but if you make the wrong ones,
it'll haunt you for the rest of your life.

439
00:34:46,414 --> 00:34:48,015
Why are you telling me this?

440
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:53,955
Because I have to believe someone can
make the right choice, even if I couldn't.

441
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,766
Get out of her.

442
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:21,815
How did you do that?

443
00:35:21,816 --> 00:35:23,717
I just did.

444
00:35:23,718 --> 00:35:28,554
Kid... you're awesome.

445
00:35:36,205 --> 00:35:38,705
Is she gonna be all right?

446
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:43,843
Eventually.

447
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:55,622
Look, uh, truth is...

448
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:59,025
...he's kind of a buddy of mine.

449
00:35:59,194 --> 00:36:00,962
Any way you could turn him back?

450
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:03,463
He tried to kill me.

451
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:06,200
Right. Uh-

452
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:09,431
But he's a good guy.
He was just confused.

453
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:16,043
Okay. It's been a long night.

454
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:18,711
We'll talk about it later.

455
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,450
What now?

456
00:36:26,488 --> 00:36:28,489
Now we take you someplace safe.

457
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,858
Get you trained up.

458
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:33,227
You'd be handy in a fight, kid.

459
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:35,728
What if I don't wanna fight?

460
00:36:35,864 --> 00:36:38,364
Jesse.

461
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:45,673
You're powerful.

462
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:51,840
More powerful than pretty much
anything we've ever seen.

463
00:36:52,014 --> 00:36:54,514
- That makes you-
- A freak?

464
00:36:57,886 --> 00:37:01,322
To some people maybe, but not to us.

465
00:37:02,024 --> 00:37:04,925
See, we're kind of freaks ourselves.

466
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:08,463
I can't stay here, can I?

467
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:10,498
No.

468
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:13,969
Demons know where you are,
more will be coming.

469
00:37:16,972 --> 00:37:19,602
I won't go without my mom and dad.

470
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:24,878
There's nothing more important
than family, we get that...

471
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:28,549
...and if you really wanna take them
with you, we'll back your play.

472
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:33,121
But you gotta understand,
it's gonna be dangerous for them too.

473
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:34,455
What do you mean?

474
00:37:34,456 --> 00:37:38,292
Our dad, he would take us with him
wherever he went.

475
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:39,694
Where is he now?

476
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:41,562
Dead.

477
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:44,063
A demon killed him.

478
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:48,535
Look, Jesse,
once you're in this fight...

479
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:53,706
...you're in it to the end.

480
00:37:53,742 --> 00:37:56,242
Win or lose.

481
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:58,713
What should I do?

482
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:01,464
We can't tell you. It's your choice.

483
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:04,947
It's not fair, I know.

484
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:10,089
Can I go see my parents?

485
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:14,895
I, uh- I need to say goodbye.

486
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:20,366
Sure.

487
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:26,332
He's been up there a long time.

488
00:39:35,544 --> 00:39:38,044
He's gone.

489
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,680
Where?
- I don't know.

490
00:39:40,749 --> 00:39:43,451
Jesse put everyone in town
back to normal.

491
00:39:43,452 --> 00:39:46,819
The ones still alive. Then he vanished.

492
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,059
Hey.

493
00:39:56,064 --> 00:39:58,564
What does it say?

494
00:40:02,571 --> 00:40:05,606
That he had to leave
to keep his parents safe.

495
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:08,237
That he loves them, and he's sorry.

496
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:12,713
How do we find him?

497
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:15,183
With the boy's powers, we can't.

498
00:40:15,184 --> 00:40:17,684
Not unless he wants to be found.

499
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:25,491
You think Jesse's gonna be okay?

500
00:40:26,628 --> 00:40:29,128
I hope so.

501
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,870
You know, we destroyed that kid's life
by telling him the truth.

502
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,739
We didn't have a choice, Dean.

503
00:40:41,243 --> 00:40:43,743
Yeah.

504
00:40:43,745 --> 00:40:48,149
You know, I'm starting to get
why parents lie to their kids.

505
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,118
You want them to believe
that the worst thing out there...

506
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,849
...is mixing Pop Rocks and Coke,
protect them from the real evil.

507
00:40:56,725 --> 00:40:59,393
You want them going to bed
feeling safe.

508
00:40:59,394 --> 00:41:02,264
If that means lying to them, so be it.

509
00:41:06,268 --> 00:41:11,433
The more I think about it,
the more I wish Dad had lied to us.

510
00:41:13,175 --> 00:41:15,675
Yeah, me too.
