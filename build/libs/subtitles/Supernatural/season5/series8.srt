- Raphael. Where is he?

5
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,561
- You know who I am.
- Lucifer.

6
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:23,856
- You're the one. You're my true vessel.
- That'll never happen.

7
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,775
- You're the Michael Sword.
- What?

8
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,818
- You're Michael's weapon.
- I'm a vessel?

9
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,070
You're the vessel.

10
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:32,365
You got a Trickster on your hands.

11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,992
- What is it? Spirit? Demon?
- More like demigods.

12
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,162
They're immortal and they
can create things out of thin air.

13
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,706
Usually with a sense of humor.
Deadly pranks.

14
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:43,751
Bobby mentioned that these suckers
have a real sweet tooth.

15
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,796
So this is fun for you?
Killing Dean over and over again?

16
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,923
Sam, there's a lesson here.

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,300
- What lesson?
- Dean's your weakness.

18
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:54,720
The bad guys know it too.
It's gonna be the death of you, Sam.

22

Hey, uh, have you
done your research yet?

26
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,814
Oh, yeah.
All kinds of research. All night.

27
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,150
Yeah? Hm.

00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,695

Oh, Dean.

30
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,410
We have some more research to do.

31
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:02,163

00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:04,415

- Are you?

53

The FBI is here why, exactly?

54
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,906
Something to do with one of your locals
getting his head ripped off.

55
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:03,993
- Bill Randolph died from a bear attack.
- How sure are you that it was a bear?

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,328
What else would it be?

57
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:08,664
Well, whatever it was, it chased
Mr. Randolph through the woods...

58
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,209
...smashed through his front door,
followed him...

59
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,836
...and killed him in his bedroom.

60
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,172
Is that common? A bear doing all that?

61
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,466
Depends how pissed off it is, I guess.

62
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,094
Look, the Randolphs live
way up in high country.

63
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,681
You got trout runs that'll make
a grown man weep and bears.

64
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,685
Right. Now, what about Mrs. Randolph?
The file says she saw the whole thing.

65
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,813
Yes, she did.
My heart goes out to that poor woman.

66
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,482
She said bear?

67
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,571
Kathy Randolph
went through a hell of a trauma.

68
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,031
She's confused.

69
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,327
What did she say?

70
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,412
No, it must have been a bear.

71
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,166
I mean, what else could it have been?

72
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,629
Mrs. Randolph,
what did you think it was?

73
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,383
Uh...

74
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,470
No, I remember clearly now.
It was definitely a bear.

75
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:09,433
We're sure it was.
But see, it helps us to hear every angle.

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,936
So just tell us
what you thought you saw.

77
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,481
Well...

78
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,109
...it's impossible...

79
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,363
...but I could have sworn I saw...

80
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,409
...the Incredible Hulk.

81
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,585
- The Incredible Hulk?
- I told you it was crazy.

82
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,254
You, um...

83
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,592
Bana or Norton?

84
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:46,220
Oh, no. Those movies were terrible.
The TV Hulk.

85
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,098
- Lou Ferrigno?
- Yes.

86
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,267
- The spiky-hair Lou Ferrigno?
- Yes.

87
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,895
Huh.

88
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,982
- You think I'm crazy.
- No. Um...

89
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,569
No, it's just... Is...?

90
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,821
Is there, uh?

91
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:10,036
Would there be any reason that
Lou Ferrigno, the Incredible Hulk, um...

92
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,872
...would have a grudge
against your husband?

93
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,583
No.

94
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,503
No.

95
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:24,550
- Hey.
- Find anything?

96
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,512
Well, I saw the house.

97
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,222
And?

98
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:33,100
And there is a giant 8-foot-wide hole
where the front door used to be.

99
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,728
- Almost like, uh...
- A Hulk-size hole?

100
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,106
Maybe. What do you got?

101
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,568
Well, turns out that Bill Randolph
had quite the temper.

102
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,989
He's got two counts of spousal battery,
bar brawls...

103
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,992
...and court-ordered
anger-management sessions.

104
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,538
You might say you wouldn't like him
when he's angry.

105
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:59,460
So a hothead getting killed
by TV's greatest hothead.

106
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,587
Kind of sounds like just desserts,
doesn't it?

107
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,422
Hm.

108
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,884
- It's all starting to make sense.
- How is it starting to make sense?

109
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,304
Well, I found something else
at the crime scene.

110
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,098
Candy wrappers.

111
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,643
Lots of them.

112
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,189
Just desserts, sweet tooth...

113
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,859
...screwing with people
before you kill them.

114
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,528
We're dealing with the Trickster,
aren't we?

115
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,280
Sure looks like.

116
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:31,784
Good. Been wanting to gank that mother
since the Mystery Spot.

117
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,704
You sure?

118
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,997
Yeah, I'm sure.

119
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:39,167
No, I mean,
are you sure you wanna kill him?

120
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,753
Son of a bitch didn't think twice
about icing me a thousand times.

121
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,338
No, I mean, I'm just saying.

122
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,341
What are you saying?
You don't wanna kill him, then what?

123
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,679
- Talk to him.
- What?

124
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,098
Look, think about it, Dean.

125
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,226
He's one of the most powerful creatures
we've ever met.

126
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,395
- Maybe we can use him.
- For what?

127
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,899
Okay, Trickster's like
a Hugh Hefner type, right?

128
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,235
Wine, women, song.
Maybe he doesn't want the party to end.

129
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,322
Maybe he hates this angels-and-demons
stuff as much as we do.

130
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,531
Maybe he'll help us.

131
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,742
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

132
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,118
Ally with the Trickster?

133
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:15,995
Yeah.

134
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,458
A bloody, violent monster...

135
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,877
...and you wanna be Facebook friends
with him?

136
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,212
Nice, Sammy.

137
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:28,049
The world is gonna end, Dean. We don't
have the luxury of a moral stand.

138
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,551
I'm just saying it's worth a shot.
That's all.

139
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,678
If it doesn't work...

140
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,388
...we'll kill him.

141
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,726
How are we gonna find the guy?

142
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,479
Well, he never takes just one victim,
right?

143
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,314
He'll show.

144
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:56,244

150

151
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,520
There was a murder here.

160

Dr. Ellen Piccolo.

- I don't know.

174
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,508
- No, seriously. What the hell?
- I don't know.

175
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,677
One theory. Any theory.

176
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,764
- Uh, the Trickster trapped us in TV Land?
- That's your theory? That's stupid.

177
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,225
<i>You're the one who said
we're on Dr. Sexy, M.D.</i>

178
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,143
Yeah, but TV Land isn't TV Land.

179
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,355
There's actors and lights
and crew members. This looks real.

180
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,525
It can't be.
Dean, how can this possibly be real?

181
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,319
I don't know, all right?

182
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,281
- Doctors.
- But there goes Dr. Wang...

183
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,784
...the sexy but arrogant heart surgeon.

184
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,745
And there's Johnny Drake.

185
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,666
Oh, he's not even alive.
He's a ghost in the mind of...

186
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,127
Of her.

187
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,380
The sexy but neurotic doctor
over there.

188
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,675
So this show has ghosts?

189
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,427
Why?

190
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,888
I don't know. It is compelling.

191
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:06,684
- I thought you said weren't a fan.
- I'm not. I'm not.

192
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,356
- Oh, boy.
- What?

193
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,400
- It's him.
- Who?

194
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,489
It's him. It's Dr. Sexy.

195
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,579
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

196
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,915
Doctor.

197
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,919
Doctor.

198
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,839
You wanna give me one good reason
why you defied my direct order...

199
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,218
...to do the experimental face transplant
on Mrs. Beale?

200
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,640
- One reason?
- Mm.

201
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,351
Sure.

202
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,777
- You're not Dr. Sexy.
- You're crazy.

203
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:02,532
Really? Because I swore
part of what makes Dr. Sexy sexy...

204
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,327
...is the fact that he wears
cowboy boots, not tennis shoes.

205
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,037
Yeah. You're not a fan.

206
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,122
It's a guilty pleasure.

207
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,626
- Call security.
- Yeah, go ahead, pal.

208
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,045
See, we know what you are.

209
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,680
You guys are getting better.

210
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,473
Get us the hell out of here.

211
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,725
Or what?

212
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,855
Don't see your wooden stakes,
big guy.

213
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,233
That was you on the police scanner,
right? And this is a trick.

214
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,402
Hello?

215
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,112
Trickster.

216
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,074
Come on. I heard you two yahoos
were in town, how could I resist?

217
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:49,245
- Where the hell are we?
- You like it? It's all homemade.

218
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:53,207
My own sets, my own actors.

219
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,461
- Call it my own little idiot box.
- How do we get out?

220
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,756
That, my friend, is the $64 question.

221
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,008
Whatever. We just...

222
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,969
We need to talk to you.
We need your help.

223
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,848
Hmm. Let me guess.

224
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,017
You two muttonheads
broke the world...

225
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,603
...and you want me
to sweep up your mess.

226
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,690
Please. Just five minutes. Hear us out.

227
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,735
Sure. Tell you what.

228
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,988
Survive the next 24 hours, we'll talk.

229
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,325
- Survive what?
- The game.

230
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,118
What game?

231
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,495
You're in it.

232
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,124
- How do we play?
- You're playing it.

233
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,043
What are the rules?

234
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,841
Oh, son of a bitch.

235
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,011
Dr. Sexy?

236
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,098
Dr. Sexy?

237
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,104
<i>Paging Dr. Sexy. Report to the ER.</i>

238
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,316
Oh, by the way, talking with monsters?
Hell of a plan.

239
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,985
Just... What do we do now?

240
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,905
You know what I'm doing? Leaving.

241
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,324
Lady, what the hell?

242
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:13,412
- You are a brilliant, brilliant...
- Yeah, a coward, you already said that.

243
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,540
But I got news for you.

244
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,166
I am not a doctor.

245
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,962
No. Don't say that.

246
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,716
You are the finest cerebrovascular
neurosurgeon I have ever met...

247
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,094
...and I have met plenty.

248
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,056
So that girl died on your table.
It wasn't your fault.

249
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,599
It wasn't anybody's fault.

250
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,102
Sometimes people just die.

251
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,314
I have no idea
what you're saying to me.

252
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,191
You're afraid.

253
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,989
You're afraid to operate again
and you're afraid to love.

254
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,328
Yeah, we're getting out of here.

255
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,330
Hey, doctor.

256
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,709
- Yes?
- My wife needs that face transplant.

257
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,461
Okay, you know what, pal?

258
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,340
None of this is real, okay?
And your wife doesn't need jack squat.

259
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,426
Okay?

260
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,140
Hey, doctor.

261
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,938
- Real. It's real.
- No, no, no.

262
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:25,109
No, no, no. Hey! We need a doctor!

263
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,208
BP's 80/50 and dropping.

264
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,925
Doctor?

265
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,637
What?

266
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,101
Sam, do something. Come on.

267
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,104
I don't know how to use
any of this crap.

268
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,190
Figure it out.

269
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,029
Sam. Come on, I'm waiting.

270
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,407
Okay, um, I need...

271
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,246
...a penknife, some dental floss,
a sewing needle...

272
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,957
...and a fifth of whiskey.

273
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,547
Stat!

274
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,226
- We okay? How's it looking?
- Yup. You'll be fine.

275
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,189
<i>I love you.</i>

276
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,888
Let's play Nutcracker!

277
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,111
Sam Winchester.

278
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,289
- Count down.
- What? Uh...

279
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,625
- What am I supposed to say?
- You think I know?

280
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,544
Uh, I don't understand Japanese.

281
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,515
Is he screwing with me?
I... I can't speak Japanese.

282
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,351
Aww.

283
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,650
Mmm.

284
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,277
I'm sorry, Sam Winchester.

285
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,531
Sorry? Heh. Sorry for what?

286
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,366
Dean?

287
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,996
Nutcracker!

288
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,922
Nutcracker!

289
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,552
- Sam?
- Yeah?

290
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,984
You okay?

291
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,245
Oh, now what?

292
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,123
Cass?

293
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,750
Is this another trick?

294
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,713
- It's me. Uh, what are you doing here?
- Us? What are you doing here?

295
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,383
- Looking for you. You've been missing.
- So get us the hell out of here then.

296
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,593
Aww.

297
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,802
Let's go.

298
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,264
- Cass?
- No, no, no.

299
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:29,437
Mr. Trickster does not like
pretty boy angels.

300
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,990
Dean Winchester.

301
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,502
- Count down.
- What do I do?

302
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,923
- I don't wanna get hit in the nuts.
- I know. Uh, uh... Just, um... Wait.

303
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,591
- What?
- I played a doctor.

304
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,052
<i>- What?
- In Dr. Sexy, I played a doctor.</i>

305
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,261
- I operated.
- So?

306
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,598
I played the role the Trickster wanted.
We have to go along with it.

307
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,517
- Go along with what?
- With the game.

308
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,521
- You're on a game show. Just answer.
- In Japanese? I don't know Japanese.

309
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,731
- Try.
- Damn it.

310
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:42,718
Dean Winchester,
Nutcracker champion!

311
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,139
- How did you do that?
- I have no idea.

312
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,269
So that's it.
We play our roles, we survive.

313
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:55,481
- Yeah, but play our roles for how long?
- Good question.

314
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,289
I've got genital herpes.

315
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,708
I've got genital herpes.

316
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,504
Seriously?

317
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,048
Hey, you're the one
who said play our roles, so...

318
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,176
Yeah. Right.

319
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,598
I've got genital herpes.

320
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,516
I tried to be responsible.

321
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,561
Did I try.

322
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:40,735
But now I take twice-daily Herpexia
to reduce my chances of passing it on.

323
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,821
Ask your doctor about using Herpexia.

324
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,240
<i>Patients should
always consult with a physician...</i>

325
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:47,909
<i>...before using Herpexia.</i>

326
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,578
<i>Possible side effects
include headache, diarrhea...</i>

327
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:54,874
<i>...permanent erectile dysfunction,
thoughts of suicide, and nausea.</i>

328
00:22:55,333 --> 00:23:00,546
I am doing all I can
to slightly lessen the spread of...

329
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,634
Of... genital herpes.

330
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,386
And that's a good thing.

331
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,397
<i>We now return to Supernatural.</i>

332
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,192
Son of a bitch.

333
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,366
I am really, really very sorry...

334
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,829
...but, ahem,
we've got some work to do.

335
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,081
But we did do work.

336
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,582
In depth.

337
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,302
How long
do we have to keep doing this?

338
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,306
I don't know.

339
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,351
Maybe forever?

340
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,604
We might die in here.

341
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,234
How is that funny? Vultures.

342
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,197
- You okay?
- I don't have much time.

343
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,283
- What happened?
- I got out.

344
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,910
- From where?
- Listen to me. Something is not right.

345
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,246
This thing is more powerful
than it should be.

346
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,165
- The Trickster?
- If it's a Trickster.

347
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,916
What do you mean?

348
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,086
Hello!

349
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,755
Thank you.

350
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,509
Thank you. Please, stop.

351
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:31,846
Hi, Castiel.

352
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,768
- You know him?
- Where did you just send him?

353
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,729
Relax. He'll live.

354
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,230
Maybe.

355
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:46,819
All right, you know what? I'm done
with the monkey dance, okay? We get it.

356
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,614
Yeah? Get what, hotshot?

357
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,282
Playing our roles, right?

358
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,409
- That's your game.
- That's half the game.

359
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:56,579
- What's the other half?
- Play your roles out there.

360
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:59,290
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know.

361
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:03,753
Sam, starring as Lucifer.
Dean, starring as Michael.

362
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,882
Your celebrity deathmatch.
Play your roles.

363
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,343
You want us to say yes
to those sons of bitches?

364
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,054
Hells, yeah. Let's light this candle.

365
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,516
- We do that, the world will end.
- Yeah?

366
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,102
And whose fault is that?

367
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,148
Who popped Lucifer
out of the box, hm?

368
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,359
Look, it's started.

369
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,861
You started it. It can't be stopped.

370
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,239
So let's get it over with.

371
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,952
Heaven or hell. Which side you on?

372
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,954
I'm not on either side.

373
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,667
Yeah, right. You're grabbing ankle
for Michael or Lucifer. Which one is it?

374
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:47,630
You listen to me, you arrogant dick.

375
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:51,217
I don't work for either of those SOBs,
believe me.

376
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:54,178
Mm. No, you're somebody's bitch.

377
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:01,561
Don't you ever,
ever presume to know what I am.

378
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:12,363
Now, listen very closely.
Here's what's gonna happen.

379
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,992
You're gonna suck it up,
accept your responsibilities...

380
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,412
...and play the roles
that destiny has chosen for you.

381
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,913
And if we don't?

382
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,796
Then you'll stay here in TV Land,
forever.

383
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,720
Three hundred channels
and nothing's on.

384
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,993
- Oh, come on.
- So, what do you think?

385
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,955
What do I think? I think
go screw yourself, that's what I think.

386
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,667
Uh, could you give us a sec, please?
Thanks.

387
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,711
- You gotta calm down.
- Calm down?

388
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,505
I am wearing sunglasses at night.

389
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:14,592
You know who does that?
No-talent douche bags. I hate this game.

390
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,595
I hate that we're in a procedural
cop show, wanna know why?

391
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:20,264
Because I hate procedural cop shows.

392
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,683
There's like 300 of them.
They're all the same.

393
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,060
It's, "Ooh...

394
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,895
...plane crashed here."
Oh, shut up.

395
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,271
- Hey.
- What?

396
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,816
Check out sweet tooth over there.

397
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,279
You think that's him?

398
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:40,034
Just, uh, follow my lead.

399
00:27:56,384 --> 00:28:00,012
- You, uh... You okay?
- Yeah.

400
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,430
What do we got?

401
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:06,727
Well, aside from the ligature marks
around his neck...

402
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:10,982
...he has what appears to be a roll
of quarters jammed down his throat.

403
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,487
Well, I say...

404
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:18,281
...jackpot.

405
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,116
Mm.

406
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:24,078
Also, there is a stab wound
to the lower abdomen there.

407
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:36,132
Well, I say...

408
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,677
...no guts, no glory.

409
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,306
Get that guy a...

410
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:45,850
...TUMS.

411
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:50,521
Gutter ball.

412
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:54,358
Good one, guys.

413
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,224
- You got the wrong guy, idiot.
- Did we?

414
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:02,218
I'm worried, man.
What that SOB did to Cass.

415
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,470
You know, where is he?

416
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,182
Sam?

417
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,395
Where are you?

418
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,650
<i>It's Sam. Leave me a message.</i>

419
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:20,695
Sam, it's me.

420
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,281
Where the hell did you go?

421
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,116
Dean?

422
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,953
Sam?

423
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,831
Where are you?

424
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:33,708
I don't know.

425
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,251
Oh, crap.

426
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,046
I don't think we killed the Trickster.

427
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,528
Okay, stake didn't work.
So, what, this another trick?

428
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:03,779
I don't know.

429
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,782
Maybe the stake didn't work
because it's not a Trickster.

430
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,784
- What do you mean?
- You heard Cass.

431
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,621
He said this thing was too powerful
to be a Trickster.

432
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,332
Notice the way he looked at Cass?
Like he knew him.

433
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:17,585
And how pissed he got when
you brought up Michael and Lucifer.

434
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:19,795
Son of a bitch.

435
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:23,007
- What?
- I think I know what we're dealing with.

436
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,062
- Dean?
- What?

437
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:39,065
That, uh, feels really uncomfortable.

438
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,985
Ow.

439
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,154
Are you sure this is gonna work?

440
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,031
No, but I have no other ideas.

441
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:55,248
All right, you son of a bitch!

442
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,000
Uncle!

443
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,504
We'll do it!

444
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:03,881
Should I honk?

445
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,094
Wow, Sam...

446
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:10,513
...get a load of the rims on you.
- Eat me.

447
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,559
Okay, boys.

448
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:18,062
- Ready to go quietly?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.

449
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:22,358
Nobody's going anywhere
until Sam has opposable thumbs.

450
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:26,863
What's the difference? Satan's gonna
ride his ass one way or another.

451
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,084
Happy?

452
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,463
Tell me one thing.
Why didn't the stake kill you?

453
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,177
- I am the Trickster.
- Or maybe you're not.

454
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,395
Maybe you've always been an angel.

455
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,481
Ha-ha-ha. A what?

456
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,984
Somebody slip a mickey
in your power shake, kid?

457
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,611
I'll tell you what.

458
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:11,574
You just jump out of the holy fire
and we'll call it our mistake.

459
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,005
Well played, boys.

460
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,673
Well played.

461
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,260
Where'd you get the holy oil?

462
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,305
Well, you might say
we pulled it out of Sam's ass.

463
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,310
- Where'd I screw up?
- You didn't.

464
00:33:39,477 --> 00:33:41,771
But nobody gets the jump on Cass
like you did.

465
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:44,899
Mostly, it was the way you talked
about Armageddon.

466
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:49,070
- Meaning?
- Well, call it personal experience.

467
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:52,573
Nobody gets that angry unless
they're talking about their own family.

468
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:58,538
So which one are you?
Grumpy, Sneezy or Douchey?

469
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,460
Gabriel, okay?

470
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:07,338
They call me Gabriel.

471
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:11,175
Gabriel? The archangel?

472
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:12,969
Guilty.

473
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:17,014
Okay, Gabriel. How does an archangel
become a Trickster?

474
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,101
My own private witness protection.

475
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:24,188
I skipped out of heaven,
had a face transplant...

476
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:26,732
...carved out my own little corner
of the world...

477
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,277
...till you two screwed it all up.

478
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,863
What did Daddy say
when you joined the pagans?

479
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,032
Daddy doesn't say anything
about anything.

480
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,243
Then what happened?
Why'd you ditch?

481
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:41,664
Well, do you blame him? His brothers
are heavyweight douche nozzles.

482
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:43,040
Shut your cake hole.

483
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,127
You don't know anything
about my family.

484
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:49,922
I loved my father, my brothers.

485
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:53,342
Loved them,
but watching them turn on each other...

486
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,094
...tear at each other's throats?

487
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:58,347
I couldn't bear it, okay?

488
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:00,224
So I left.

489
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,853
And now it's happening all over again.

490
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,062
Then help us stop it.

491
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,732
It can't be stopped.

492
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:11,444
- You wanna see the end of the world?
- I want it to be over.

493
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:16,240
I have to sit back and watch my own
brothers kill each other, thanks to you.

494
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,577
Heaven, hell, I don't care who wins.

495
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:23,456
- I just want it to be over.
- It doesn't have to be like that.

496
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,958
There has to be some way
to pull the plug.

497
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,296
You do not know my family.

498
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:35,384
What you guys call the apocalypse,
I used to call Sunday dinner.

499
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:39,597
That's why there's no stopping this,
because this isn't about a war.

500
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:44,936
It's about two brothers that loved
each other and betrayed each other.

501
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,522
You think you'd be able to relate.

502
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:50,024
What are you talking about?

503
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:58,241
You sorry sons of bitches.

504
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,953
Why do you think you two
are the vessels?

505
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:03,913
Think about it.

506
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,459
Michael, the big brother,
loyal to an absent father.

507
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:15,883
And Lucifer, the little brother,
rebellious of Daddy's plan.

508
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,595
You were born to this, boys.

509
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:23,099
It's your destiny. It was always you.

510
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:30,147
As it is in heaven,
so it must be on Earth.

511
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:33,067
One brother has to kill the other.

512
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,652
What the hell are you saying?

513
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:38,739
Why do you think I've always taken
such an interest in you?

514
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:43,828
Because from the moment
Dad flipped on the lights around here...

515
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:47,957
...we knew it was all gonna end
with you.

516
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,585
Always.

517
00:36:58,301 --> 00:36:59,635
No.

518
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,598
That's not gonna happen.

519
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:06,017
I'm sorry...

520
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:07,643
...but it is.

521
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:19,947
Guys, I wish this were a TV show.

522
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:23,868
Easy answers,
endings wrapped up in a bow.

523
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:29,290
But this is real.

524
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,211
And it's gonna end bloody
for all of us.

525
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:37,882
That's just how it's gotta be.

526
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:54,732
So, boys, now what?

527
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:58,152
Stare at each other
for the rest of eternity?

528
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:03,115
First, you're gonna bring Cass
back from wherever you stashed him.

529
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:05,493
- Oh, am I?
- Yeah.

530
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,954
Or we're going to dunk you
in some holy oil...

531
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,331
...and deep-fry ourselves an archangel.

532
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,928
Cass, you okay?

533
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:26,389
I'm fine.

534
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:30,393
Hello, Gabriel.

535
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,979
Hey, bro.

536
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,231
How's the search for Daddy going?

537
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:37,316
Let me guess. Awful.

538
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:46,409
Okay, we're out of here.

539
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:49,996
Come on, Sam.

540
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:53,875
Uh, okay.

541
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:59,338
Guys? So... So, what? Huh?

542
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:02,508
You're just gonna...
You're gonna leave me here forever?

543
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,637
No.

544
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:11,058
We're not, because we don't
screw with people the way you do.

545
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:14,270
And for the record...

546
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:17,607
...this isn't about some prizefight
between your brothers.

547
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:20,735
Or some destiny
that can't be stopped.

548
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:24,655
This is about you being too afraid
to stand up to your family.

549
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:50,765
Don't say I never did anything for you.

550
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:13,454
All that stuff he was spouting in there,
you think he was telling the truth?

551
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:16,123
I think he believes it.

552
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,502
So, what do we do?

553
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,463
I don't know.

554
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:28,010
I'll tell you one thing, right about now,
I wish I was back on a TV show.

555
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,013
Yeah, me too.
