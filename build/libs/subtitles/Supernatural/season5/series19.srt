1
00:00:03,372 --> 00:00:04,703
Sam, starring as Lucifer.

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:06,774
Dean, starring as Michael.

3
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:10,610
Suck it up, accept your responsibilities...

4
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:13,577
...and play the roles
that destiny has chosen for you.

5
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:15,239
Why didn't the stake kill you?

6
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:17,942
- I am the Trickster.
- Or maybe you're not.

7
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:21,278
- Hello, Gabriel.
- The archangel.

8
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:24,449
This isn't about some prizefight
between your brothers.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,289
This is about you being too afraid
to stand up to your family.

10
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:30,464
- You gonna do something?
- Like?

11
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,463
- Michael stupid.
- Come on, Sam.

12
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,101
Things are about to get bad.

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,967
They're not gonna get anything from me
without agreeing to a few conditions.

14
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:40,801
- Whatever you're thinking, don't do it.
- I have to.

15
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:44,634
You're ready. There's no other choice.
There's never been a choice.

16
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:46,246
- The answer is yes.
- Dean.

17
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:51,718
Of course, I have a few conditions.

18
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:56,089
- What changed your mind?
- Damnedest thing. World's ending...

19
00:00:56,258 --> 00:01:00,217
...walls are coming down on us. I didn't
wanna let you down. So screw destiny.

20
00:01:00,396 --> 00:01:02,660
I say we take the fight to them,
do it our way.

21
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:43,032
Hello?

22
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:09,490
Hello?

23
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:35,050
- Ah!
- Hi.

24
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:37,821
- Buddy, you can't be here.
- Of course I can.

25
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:42,589
Someone's gotta get everything ready.
They're coming, all of them.

26
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,362
And we've each got our part to play.
Even you.

27
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,030
- What?
- You're dinner.

28
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:54,399
No! Ahh! Ahh!

29
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:17,027
Whew.

30
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:28,339
Nice digs for once.

31
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:40,050
- Busy night.
- Any port in a storm, I guess.

32
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:43,287
- Lf you could just fill this out, please.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:49,353
Sir, I think you got
a little shaving nick there.

34
00:03:57,473 --> 00:03:59,771
- Your key.
- Oh, thanks.

35
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:01,500
Hey, you have a coffee shop?

36
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:05,141
Buffet, all you can eat.

37
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:07,782
Best pie in the tristate area.

38
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:10,317
You don't say.

39
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:17,889
Heaven, right?

40
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:21,428
Trust me, pal. Better.

41
00:04:34,476 --> 00:04:36,535
- How you doing?
- No.

42
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,770
- But...
- No.

43
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,480
- Oh, lady, I'm just...
- I understand.

44
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:45,909
And no.

45
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:50,054
Ten-four, yeah.

46
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,667
Sam, unpucker, man. Eat something.

47
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:02,569
We should hit the road, Dean.

48
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:05,332
- In this storm? What, it's...
- It's biblical.

49
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:08,999
Exactly. It's frigging Noah's ark out there
and we're eating pie.

50
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:13,804
How many hours of sleep did you get
this week? What, three? Four?

51
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:16,373
Bobby's got his feelers out.

52
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:19,544
We've talked with every Hoodoo man
and root woman in 12 states.

53
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,690
- Yeah, well, I'm not giving up.
- Nobody's giving up.

54
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,161
Especially me.

55
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:30,031
We're gonna find a way
to beat the devil.

56
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,325
Soon, I can feel it.

57
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,434
And we will find Cass,
we will find Adam.

58
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:36,070
But you are no good to me burnt out.

59
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,433
Yeah.

60
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,736
Yeah, okay.

61
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:47,075
Come on. We have actually got the night
off for once. Let's try to enjoy it.

62
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:13,201
- Oh, what are you, 12?
- I'm young at heart.

63
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,708
Wow, look at this.
We're like Rockefellers.

64
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:24,444
Chocolates. Ohh.

65
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:28,381
- You want yours?
- Knock yourself out.

66
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,724
<i>Whoa, Casa Erotica 13 on demand.</i>

67
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:38,426
What?

68
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,433
Isn't this place kind of
in the middle of nowhere?

69
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:45,673
- So?
- So, what's a four-star hotel doing...

70
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:48,241
...on a no-star highway?

71
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:05,418
Hello?

72
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:15,160
Hello?

73
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:34,616
The room next to ours...

74
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,691
The couple that are joined at the lips,
have you seen them?

75
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:41,451
Mr. And Mrs. Logan?
The honeymooners?

76
00:07:42,798 --> 00:07:44,561
They checked out.

77
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,030
Is something the matter?

78
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:48,897
- They checked out?
- Mm-hm. Just now.

79
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:54,474
Really? It sort of seemed like they
were in the middle of something.

80
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:57,703
It's kind of weird for honeymooners
to check out without this.

81
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,471
Oh, dear.

82
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:03,175
I'll just put that right
in the lost and found. Don't you worry.

83
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:05,877
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

84
00:08:06,188 --> 00:08:09,351
- No, no. We're good.
- Super fantastic.

85
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:15,089
Creepy.

86
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:17,322
Broke the needle.

87
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,895
Well, I'll scope out the joint...

88
00:08:20,068 --> 00:08:22,593
...and you keep an eye
on Norman Bates over here.

89
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:25,831
I mean, one night off,
is that too much to ask?

90
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:17,285
This ain't no peep show, man.

91
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,291
You're beautiful.

92
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:29,300
You're sweet.

93
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:32,963
- I hate sweet.
Ahem.

94
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:34,841
Sorry to interrupt.

95
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,341
The last guest just arrived.

96
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:39,006
- So everything's ready?
- As it will ever be.

97
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:41,916
Pantry's full.

98
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,481
- And the Winchesters?
- Suspicious, but under control.

99
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:49,454
- You have their blood?
- Of course I do. I'm quick.

100
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:55,091
Boys never even knew what hit them.

101
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:57,029
Thank you, Mercury.

102
00:09:57,499 --> 00:10:00,332
Okay, let's get this show on the road.

103
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:04,598
- An elephant?
- Yeah.

104
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:07,037
- Like, an elephant?
- Like full-on Babar.

105
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:09,676
So, what the hell is?

106
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:14,676
Where is everybody?

107
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:22,353
Let me guess, it's locked.

108
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:25,822
So, what, the roaches check in,
they don't check out?

109
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:27,858
Think about how we got here.

110
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,860
That detour on l-90?

111
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:32,295
The frigging hurricane?

112
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:37,071
- You saying we were lead here?
- Like rats in a maze.

113
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:08,166
Please be tomato soup,
please be tomato soup.

114
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:13,541
Motel Hell.

115
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:28,913
Help us. Get us out.

116
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:36,058
- Hurry up.
- I'm going as fast as l... As I can.

117
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:38,797
There's somebody behind me,
isn't there?

118
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:12,625
Something tells me
this isn't a Shriner convention.

119
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:20,307
Dinner is served.

120
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:27,976
Ladies and gentlemen...

121
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,941
...our guests of honor have arrived.

122
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:41,152
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

123
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:44,355
In all my centuries,
I never thought I'd see this.

124
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:47,429
- This many gods under one roof.
- Gods?

125
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:50,298
And before we get down
to brass tacks, some ground rules:

126
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,632
No slaughtering each other,
curb your wrath.

127
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:57,437
Oh, and keep your hands
off the local virgins.

128
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,944
We're trying
to keep a low profile here.

129
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:04,245
- Oh, we are so, so screwed.
- And we all know why we're here.

130
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,818
The Judeo-Christian apocalypse
looms over us.

131
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:11,925
I know, we've all had
our little disagreements in the past...

132
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:16,291
...but the time has come to put those
aside and look toward the future.

133
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:19,900
Because if we don't,
we won't have one.

134
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:23,695
Now, we do have
two very valuable bargaining chips:

135
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:26,703
Michael and Lucifer's vessels.

136
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:30,639
The question is: What do we do now?

137
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:33,139
Anybody have any bright ideas?
Speak up.

138
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:35,841
This is a safe room.

139
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:40,479
I don't like his tone.

140
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:43,624
Kill them? Why? So the angels here
can bring them back again?

141
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,784
I don't know what everybody's
getting so worked up about.

142
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:52,024
This is just a couple of angels
having a slap fight. It's no Armageddon.

143
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,498
Everybody knows
when the world comes to end...

144
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:56,796
...the great serpent J?rmungandr
rises up...

145
00:13:56,971 --> 00:14:01,499
...and I myself will be eaten
by a big wolf.

146
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,876
Oh, yeah? And why is that?

147
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:09,147
Because your beliefs
are so much more realistic?

148
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:12,051
Whole world's
getting carried around...

149
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,815
...on the back of a giant turtle.
Ha! Give me a break.

150
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:19,359
What are you gonna do?

151
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:22,821
You watch your mouth, boy.

152
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:26,694
No one's ever proved that.

153
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,204
Stay.

154
00:14:39,848 --> 00:14:41,475
We have to fight.

155
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:47,620
The archangels, the only thing
they understand is violence.

156
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:50,922
This ends in blood,
there is no other way.

157
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:55,461
It's them or us.

158
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,192
With all due respect, ma'am...

159
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:03,633
...we haven't even tried
talking to them.

160
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:18,551
Kali.

161
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:21,115
Who asked you?

162
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:26,658
Can't we all just get along?

163
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:29,259
Gab... Ugh.

164
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:32,298
Tsk, tsk. Sam, Dean.

165
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:37,135
It's always wrong place, worst time
with you muttonheads, huh?

166
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,336
Loki.

167
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:41,974
Baldur.

168
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:44,236
Good seeing you too.

169
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:47,176
I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail.

170
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:49,839
- Why are you here?
- To talk about the elephant.

171
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,641
Not you.

172
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:54,587
The apocalypse.

173
00:15:55,356 --> 00:15:58,757
We can't stop it, gang.

174
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,820
But first things first.

175
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:06,261
The adults need to have
a little conversation.

176
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:07,696
Check you later.

177
00:16:13,475 --> 00:16:15,443
Okay, did that...?

178
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,771
- Holy crap.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

179
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:21,074
By the way,
next time I say "let's keep driving"...

180
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:24,117
...let's keep driving.
- Okay, yeah. Next time.

181
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:26,310
All right, so, what's our next move?

182
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:29,480
I don't know.

183
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:31,783
We grab those poor saps
out of the freezer.

184
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,724
Bust them out,
gank a few freaks if we're lucky.

185
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:37,330
And when are you ever lucky?

186
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,160
- You know what? Bite me, Gabriel.
- Later, big boy.

187
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:44,499
I should've known. This had your stink
all over it from the jump.

188
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:48,835
You think I'm behind this? Please.

189
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,502
I'm the Costner to your Houston.
I'm here to save your ass.

190
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,841
- You wanna pull us out of the fire?
- Bingo.

191
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,150
Those gods are gonna dust you
or use you as bait.

192
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,843
Either way, you're uber-boned.

193
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:04,549
Because a couple months ago, you were
telling us that we need to play our roles.

194
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:05,920
You were uber-boning us.

195
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,994
Ohh, the end is still nigh.

196
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:12,496
Michael and Lucifer
are gonna dance the lambada.

197
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,261
But not tonight, not here.

198
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:18,335
And why do you care?

199
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:22,004
I don't care.

200
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:28,512
But me and Kali, we had a thing.

201
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,051
Chick was all hands.

202
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:33,720
What can I say, I'm sentimental.

203
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:36,921
Do they have a chance against Satan?

204
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:40,288
- Really, Sam?
- You got a better idea, Dean?

205
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,553
It's a bad idea.

206
00:17:43,398 --> 00:17:45,923
Lucifer's gonna turn them
into finger paint.

207
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,796
- Let's get going while the going's good.
Okay, great.

208
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,200
- Just zap us out of here.
- Would if I could.

209
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:54,364
But Kali's got you
by the short and curlies.

210
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,367
It's a blood spell.

211
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:59,775
- You boys are on a leash.
- What does that mean?

212
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:03,475
Means it's time
for a little of the old black magic.

213
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:08,053
We're gonna take the hors d'oeuvres
in the freezer with us.

214
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:11,714
Forget it. It's gonna be hard enough
sneaking you mooks out of here.

215
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:15,090
They called you Loki, right?
They don't really know who you are.

216
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:17,231
Told you. I'm in witness protection.

217
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:19,992
Okay, well, then how about
you do what we say...

218
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:24,999
...or we tell the Legion of Doom
about your secret identity.

219
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:28,505
- They don't seem like a pro-angel crowd.
- I'll take your voices away.

220
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,507
- We'll write.
- I'll cut off your hands.

221
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:34,341
People are gonna be asking, "Why are
you guys running around with no hands?"

222
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:39,479
Fine.

223
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:53,632
<i>Bonjour, mon amour.</i>

224
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:57,632
- Leave.
- You always did play hard to get.

225
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,466
- I've moved on.
- I noticed.

226
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:02,275
Baldur?

227
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:04,138
Really?

228
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:09,441
Baldur's uncomplicated.

229
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:14,015
No! No! No!

230
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,188
No! No! Stop!

231
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:21,822
No! No!

232
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,691
It's too late.

233
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,028
No!

234
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:30,166
KALl:
I never took you for the type.

235
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:33,136
- Romantic?
- Pathetic.

236
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:36,709
You're the one who called me here.

237
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:39,972
Because I thought
you might take this seriously.

238
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:45,416
I'm taking this seriously.
Ship's sinking, time to get off.

239
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:49,579
I mean, screw this marble.
Let's go check out Pandora.

240
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,520
It doesn't have to be like that.

241
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,055
Afraid it does.

242
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:59,227
- Lf we fight...
- You die.

243
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,265
And what makes you such an expert?

244
00:20:01,436 --> 00:20:03,927
I've tussled with those ass-monkeys
once or twice.

245
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:07,506
Kali, no more tricks.

246
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:10,235
I'm begging you, don't do this.

247
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:13,380
I have to.

248
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:20,679
Can't blame me for trying.

249
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:25,615
- Still love me?
- No.

250
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,438
Ow!

251
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:55,617
Where the hell is Gabriel?

252
00:20:56,357 --> 00:21:00,123
You must take me for a fool, Gabriel.

253
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:05,757
You're bound to me. Now and forever.

254
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,435
Ghostfacers!

255
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:13,267
<i>Ghost, Ghostfacers</i>

256
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:16,373
<i>We face the ghost
When the others will not</i>

257
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:18,812
<i>Ghost, Ghostfacers</i>

258
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,145
<i>Stay in the kitchen
When the kitchen gets hot</i>

259
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:26,749
Is the intern position open?

260
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:28,650
- You're hired.
- Really?

261
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:30,984
- You see my face? See your little box?
Yeah.

262
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,320
Okay, my face is gonna be
right in your box.

263
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:36,258
<i>Ghostfacers
We face the faceless</i>

264
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,594
<i>We face the dead
Ghostfacers</i>

265
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:46,106
- lf you're dead, you better stay dead.
- Yeah.

266
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:48,174
Because if not, we're gonna kill you.

267
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:02,178
- How long have you known?
- Long enough.

268
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,489
How's the rescue going?

269
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:10,186
Well, surprise, surprise.

270
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:14,158
- The Trickster has tricked us.
- Kali, don't.

271
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:15,597
You're mine now.

272
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:23,336
And you have something I want.

273
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:35,848
An archangel's blade.

274
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:41,120
From the archangel Gabriel.

275
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,794
Okay, okay.

276
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,700
So I got wings. Like Kotex.

277
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:54,467
But that doesn't make me
any less right about Lucifer.

278
00:22:54,642 --> 00:22:55,836
He's lying.

279
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,604
- He's a spy.
- I'm not a spy.

280
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:01,873
I'm a runaway. I'm trying to save you.

281
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:05,684
I know my brother, Kali.

282
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,850
He should scare the living crap
out of you.

283
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:11,218
You can't beat him.

284
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:14,293
I've skipped ahead,
seen how this story ends.

285
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:17,954
Your story, not ours.

286
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:22,196
Westerners.
I swear, the sheer arrogance.

287
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,197
You think you're the only ones
on Earth.

288
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:28,703
You pillage and you butcher
in your God's name.

289
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:33,907
But you're not the only religion
and he's not the only God.

290
00:23:34,482 --> 00:23:38,077
And now you think
you can just rip the planet apart?

291
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:39,844
You're wrong.

292
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:43,046
There are billions of us...

293
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:45,821
...and we were here first.

294
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:48,927
If anyone gets to end this world...

295
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:53,333
...it's me.

296
00:23:57,805 --> 00:23:59,830
I'm sorry.

297
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:23,389
This is crazy.

298
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:24,756
They can die.

299
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:31,468
We can kill Lucifer.

300
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,632
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

301
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:38,402
Are you out of your mind?

302
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,604
I'm out of options.

303
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:44,548
Now, on any other given day,
I'd be doing my damnedest...

304
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:48,917
...to kill you,
you filthy, murdering chimps. Ha, ha.

305
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,119
But, hey...

306
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:54,124
...desperate times.

307
00:24:55,863 --> 00:25:00,129
So even though I'd love nothing better
than to slit your throats, you dicks...

308
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:05,462
...I'm gonna help you.

309
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:08,405
I'm gonna help you ice the devil.

310
00:25:11,412 --> 00:25:14,779
And then we can all get back
to ganking each other like normal.

311
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:16,916
You want Lucifer?

312
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:21,678
Well, dude's not in the Yellow Pages.
But me and Sam, we can get him here.

313
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:23,817
How?

314
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:28,018
First, you let those main courses go,
then we talk.

315
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,498
Oh, we can either
take on the devil together...

316
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:34,532
...or you lame-ass bitches
can eat me.

317
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,665
Literally.

318
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:42,200
Come on, everybody.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

319
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:47,046
All right, all right. Go, go, go.
Get out of here.

320
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,978
Pst! Dean.

321
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:52,718
Don't look at me.

322
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:56,152
Act natural. Get in.

323
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,121
Nothing natural about this.
I thought you were dead.

324
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:09,235
You think I'd give
Kali my real sword? That thing can kill me.

325
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:12,165
- Then what do they have in there?
- A fake.

326
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:15,797
Made it out of a can
of Diet Orange Slice.

327
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:21,877
- So go snag our blood, would you?
- What?

328
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:25,951
I heard you in there, Kali likes you.
You can get close.

329
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,213
- Lift the plasma, then we vamoose.
- No.

330
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:32,550
Hand over the real blade.

331
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:36,162
Better yet, why don't you sack up
and help us take down Lucifer?

332
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:38,664
- You can't be serious.
- Deadly.

333
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,199
Since when are you butt buddies
with monsters?

334
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:44,235
- That's all they are to you, aren't they?
- Sam was right.

335
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:46,600
It's nuts,
but it's the best idea I've heard.

336
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:48,742
So unless you have a better one...

337
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:51,876
Well, good luck with that.

338
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,445
Me, I'm blowing Jonestown.

339
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:56,208
Lemmings wanna run off a cliff,
that's their business.

340
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:57,441
I see through you.

341
00:26:57,618 --> 00:27:00,451
The smart-ass shell.
The whole "I could give a crap" thing.

342
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:02,350
Believe me, takes one to know one.

343
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:03,785
- That so?
- Yes.

344
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:06,016
Those freaks aren't blood,
they are family.

345
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,352
They just stabbed me
in the frigging heart.

346
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:11,396
Maybe. But you still give a crap
about them, don't you?

347
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:14,762
- Dean.
- They're gonna die in there without you.

348
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:19,206
I can't kill my brother.

349
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:23,434
Can't or won't?

350
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:28,378
That's what I thought.

351
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:36,617
So you're going to summon Lucifer?

352
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:41,159
Sort of. I just need you
to squeegee some stuff from my ribs...

353
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:44,661
...and he'll come running.
- Breaking them would be easier.

354
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:51,336
Show's over. Sword's a fake.

355
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,103
And Gabriel? He's still kicking.

356
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:57,576
I hate to break it to you, sister,
but you've been tricked.

357
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,317
Checking in.

358
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:15,626
Lucifer.

359
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,024
Thanks for coming.

360
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:19,666
Oh, you did right calling me.

361
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:25,066
It's just the way the talk
is heading in there, it's...

362
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:27,173
It's insane.

363
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:31,876
You know,
I never understood you pagans.

364
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:34,810
You're such petty little things.

365
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:40,776
Always fighting, always happy
to sell out your own kind.

366
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:44,723
No wonder you forfeited this planet
to us.

367
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:48,228
You are worse than humans.

368
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:50,924
You're worse than demons...

369
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:53,692
...and yet you claim to be gods.

370
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:07,103
And they call me prideful.

371
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,314
What's happening?

372
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:45,378
It's him.

373
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:46,946
How?

374
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:49,681
Does it matter?
Shazam us out of here, would you?

375
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:51,825
We can't.

376
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,027
Of course you can't.

377
00:29:57,698 --> 00:29:59,393
You didn't say "Mother May I."

378
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,491
Sam, Dean, good to see you again.

379
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,968
Baldur, don't.

380
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:06,572
You think you own the planet?

381
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,243
What gives you the right?

382
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,039
No one gives us the right.

383
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,540
We take it.

384
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:45,038
- You okay?
- Yeah.

385
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:46,941
Not really.

386
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:50,076
Better late than never, huh?

387
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:53,819
Guard this with your life.

388
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:10,127
Lucy, I'm home.

389
00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:14,566
Not this time.

390
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:25,984
Guys, get her out of here.

391
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:32,218
Over a girl. Gabriel, really?

392
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:34,987
I mean, I knew you were slumming...

393
00:31:35,262 --> 00:31:37,730
...but I hope
you didn't catch anything.

394
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:42,566
Lucifer, you're my brother
and I love you.

395
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,767
But you are a great big bag of dicks.

396
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,805
What did you just say to me?

397
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:51,968
Look at yourself. Boo-hoo.

398
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:54,644
Daddy was mean to me
so I'm gonna smash his toys.

399
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:57,306
- Watch your tone.
- Play the victim all you want...

400
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:59,418
...but you and me?

401
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:01,611
We know the truth.

402
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:08,962
Dad loved you best,
more than Michael, more than me.

403
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:13,127
Then he brought the new baby home
and you couldn't handle it.

404
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,532
So all this is just a great big
temper tantrum.

405
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:22,468
Time to grow up.

406
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:27,947
- I'm not getting in that thing.
- Just get in the car, princess.

407
00:32:33,554 --> 00:32:36,648
- Gabriel, if you're doing this for Michael...
- Screw him.

408
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:40,055
If he were standing here,
I'd shiv his ass too.

409
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:43,052
- You disloyal...
- Oh, I'm loyal.

410
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,496
- To them.
- Who?

411
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:49,534
These so-called gods?

412
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:52,365
To people, Lucifer.

413
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,306
- People.
- So you're willing to die...

414
00:32:55,676 --> 00:32:57,974
...for a pile of cockroaches? Why?

415
00:32:58,378 --> 00:32:59,868
Because Dad was right.

416
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:05,248
- They are better than us.
- They are broken, flawed abortions.

417
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:06,817
Damn right, they're flawed.

418
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:13,820
But a lot of them try to do better,
to forgive.

419
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:17,696
And you should see
the Spearmint Rhino.

420
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,466
I've been riding the pine a long time,
but I'm in the game now.

421
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:28,598
And I'm not on your side or Michael's.

422
00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:32,411
I'm on theirs.

423
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,044
Brother, don't make me do this.

424
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:40,516
No one makes us do anything.

425
00:33:42,723 --> 00:33:45,351
I know you think
you're doing the right thing, Gabriel.

426
00:33:45,726 --> 00:33:49,719
But I know where your heart truly lies.

427
00:33:57,404 --> 00:33:58,530
Here.

428
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,810
Amateur hocus-pocus.

429
00:34:06,013 --> 00:34:07,605
Don't forget.

430
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:11,273
You learned all your tricks from me,
little brother.

431
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:58,523
<i>Dear Diary, being a high-powered
business president is super fun...</i>

432
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:00,496
<i>... but so exhausting.</i>

433
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:03,067
<i>Sometimes I just need to relax.</i>

434
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:06,228
<i>I need Casa Erotica.</i>

435
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:09,165
Room service.

436
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:11,201
<i>Come in.</i>

437
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:14,575
Gabriel wanted you to guard this
with your life?

438
00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:17,273
Maybe he's a fan. It is a good one.

439
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:22,217
<i>I've got the kielbasa you ordered.</i>

440
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,516
<i>Ohh. Polish?</i>

441
00:35:24,691 --> 00:35:26,716
<i>Hungarian.</i>

442
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:37,397
<i>- What the hell's going on?
So nice.</i>

443
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:40,602
<i>Sam, Dean...</i>

444
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:44,171
<i>... you're probably wondering
what the hell's going on.</i>

445
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:50,049
<i>Well, if you're watching this,
I'm dead.</i>

446
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:55,817
<i>Oh, please, stop sobbing.
It's embarrassing for all of us.</i>

447
00:35:55,989 --> 00:36:00,187
<i>Without me, you got zero shot
at killing Lucifer.</i>

448
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:01,955
<i>Sorry.</i>

449
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:04,723
<i>But you can trap him.</i>

450
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:08,564
<i>The cage you sprung Lucifer from,
it's still down there.</i>

451
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:12,831
<i>And maybe, just maybe,
you can shove his ass back in.</i>

452
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:15,165
<i>Not that it'll be easy.</i>

453
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:18,311
<i>You gotta get the cage open,
trick my bro back into it...</i>

454
00:36:18,612 --> 00:36:23,345
<i>... and, oh, yeah, avoid Michael
and the God squad.</i>

455
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:26,509
<i>But, hey, details, right?</i>

456
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:31,685
<i>And here's the big secret
Lucifer himself doesn't even know.</i>

457
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:35,089
<i>But the key to the cage,
it's out there.</i>

458
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:38,822
<i>Actually, it's "keys," plural.</i>

459
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:40,091
<i>Four keys.</i>

460
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:43,862
<i>Well, four rings from the horsemen.</i>

461
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:46,733
<i>You get them all, you got the cage.</i>

462
00:36:47,274 --> 00:36:53,008
<i>Can't say I'm betting on you boys,
but, hey, I've been wrong before.</i>

463
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,274
<i>And, Dean, you were right.</i>

464
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:59,180
<i>I was afraid
to stand up to my brother.</i>

465
00:36:59,953 --> 00:37:01,978
<i>But not anymore.</i>

466
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:05,324
<i>So this is me standing up...</i>

467
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:09,521
<i>... and this is me lying down.</i>

468
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:16,562
<i>- My goodness. You're naughty.
- Oh. Oh, man.</i>

469
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:21,804
Horsemen, huh?

470
00:37:22,976 --> 00:37:24,136
Well, we got War's.

471
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:29,673
We nicked Famine's.

472
00:37:31,017 --> 00:37:33,542
That's two rings down.
Collect all four?

473
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,518
<i>- All we need is Pestilence and Death.
Oh, is that all?</i>

474
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:39,052
It's a plan.

475
00:38:32,712 --> 00:38:33,770
The hell?

476
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:47,117
Does this stuff make you drowsy?
I've got a lot of driving to do.

477
00:38:47,294 --> 00:38:49,387
Blue ones make you sleepy.

478
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:52,896
Red and orange ones are okay
for daytime.

479
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:01,601
Oh, the living.
