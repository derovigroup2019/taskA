1
00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:04,608
- Meg.
- Hi.

2
00:00:05,577 --> 00:00:06,843
whoa, whoa!

3
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:08,712
- You were hunting with Jo?
- Yeah, for a while now.

4
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:10,581
The mooks have melted down
the gun by now.

5
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:11,815
Well, I hear differently.

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,318
And if you are still set
on the insane task

7
00:00:14,352 --> 00:00:16,820
of killing the devil,
this is how we do it.

8
00:00:16,854 --> 00:00:19,055
In chapter 33 of "supernatural,"
there was that girl, Bela.

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,324
She stole the colt
from you,

10
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:22,359
and then she "said"
she gave it to Lilith, remember?

11
00:00:22,393 --> 00:00:24,294
- Yeah.
- Well, you know she lied, right?

12
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:26,563
- She never really gave it to Lilith.
- What?

13
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:28,498
Bela gives the colt
to a demon named, Crowley.

14
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,133
Crowley?

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,514
Oh.

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,295
Mr. Pendleton, I presume.

17
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,929
The name's Crowley.

18
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:03,800
I-in my negotiations,
I was, uh,

19
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:06,403
dealing with a very young,
attractive, uh, lady.

20
00:01:06,437 --> 00:01:08,338
Yes. I know.

21
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:11,275
But you,
piggy banker...

22
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:14,544
You... are a big fish

23
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:16,146
and I wanted
to do you the honour

24
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,748
of sealing this deal
personally.

25
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:20,751
But she said the deal
would be sealed with a kiss.

26
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:22,152
That's right.

27
00:01:24,822 --> 00:01:26,690
No, I mean, she's...

28
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:28,024
Your choice.

29
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:32,629
You can cling to six decades
of deep-seated homophobia

30
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:34,765
or just give it up,

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,767
and get
a complete bailout

32
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:39,569
of your bank's
ridiculous incompetence.

33
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:42,439
There are just things...

34
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:43,740
Going once...

35
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:45,141
No, I don't think so.

36
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:46,142
Going twice...

37
00:01:46,177 --> 00:01:47,744
All right!
All right!

38
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:51,782
No!

39
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,927
Got him.

40
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:11,930
Supernatural Season 5 Episode 10
       "Abandon All Hope"

41
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:17,841
The demon Crowley
is making a deal,

42
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,877
even as we speak, it's...

43
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:22,912
Going... down.

44
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:25,816
"going down"?

45
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,916
Right.

46
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:28,652
Okay, huggy bear.
just don't lose him.

47
00:02:28,686 --> 00:02:29,986
I won't lose him.

48
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,822
Damn you.

49
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,160
Enjoy, the obscene wealth.

50
00:02:37,194 --> 00:02:39,429
See you in 10 years.

51
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:56,847
I followed him.

52
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:59,148
It's not far, but...

53
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:04,454
It's layered in Enochian 
warding magic.

54
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:07,924
I can't get in.

55
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,660
That's okay. You did great.
We'll take it from here.

56
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:24,073
# everybody plays the fool
sometimes #

57
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:28,278
# there's no exception
to the rule #

58
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:30,414
# listen, baby #

59
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:33,983
# it may be factual,
may be cruel #

60
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:36,219
# I ain't lyin' #

61
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:39,890
# everybody plays the fool #

62
00:03:46,397 --> 00:03:47,531
Yeah?

63
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:51,468
Hello? my car broke down.
I-I need some help.

64
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:53,437
I'll be down
in a minute.

65
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,353
Evening, pretty lady.

66
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:13,289
Get yourself
on in here.

67
00:04:13,324 --> 00:04:15,391
I just need
to make a call.

68
00:04:15,426 --> 00:04:17,928
You don't need
to call anyone, baby.

69
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:20,597
We're the only help
you're ever gonna need.

70
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:23,066
You know what, I...

71
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,068
I think I should wait
by my car.

72
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,706
We said get 
your ass in here.

73
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,249
Nice work, Jo.

74
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:41,284
Thanks.

75
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:45,088
Okay. Shall we?

76
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:47,691
# everybody plays the fool #

77
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:49,258
# listen to me, ba...#

78
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:59,803
It's "Crowley," right?

79
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:03,773
So... the hardy boys
finally found me.

80
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:05,876
Took you long enough.

81
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:26,329
Do you have any idea
how much this rug costs?

82
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,101
This is it, right?

83
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:36,873
This is, what it's all about.

84
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:52,288
We need to talk.

85
00:05:52,322 --> 00:05:53,790
Privately.

86
00:05:58,429 --> 00:05:59,729
What the hell
is this?

87
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:02,398
Do you know how deep
I could have buried this thing?

88
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:05,501
There's no reason
you or anyone

89
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:08,204
Should know
this even exists at all.

90
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:09,873
Except that I told you.

91
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:11,675
<i>You told us?</i>

92
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,778
Rumours, innuendo...
sent out on the grapevine.

93
00:06:14,812 --> 00:06:16,512
Why?

94
00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:18,682
Why tell us anything?

95
00:06:20,551 --> 00:06:24,588
I want you, to take 
this thing to Lucifer

96
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:26,890
and empty it
into his face.

97
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:28,592
Uh-huh.

98
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:29,893
Okay,

99
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:33,930
<i>and why exactly
would you want the devil dead?</i>

100
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:36,066
It's called...

101
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,702
Survival.

102
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:42,438
But I forgot... you two,
at best, are functional morons.

103
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:45,008
<i>Yeah, you're
functioning... morons.</i>

104
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:46,476
Mor...

105
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,913
Lucifer isn't a demon,
remember?

106
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:51,214
He's an angel...

107
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:54,618
an angel famous for 
his hatred of humankind.

108
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:58,788
To him, you're just...
filthy bags of pus.

109
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:01,257
<i>If that's the way
he feels about you...</i>

110
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:04,060
<i>what can he think
about us?</i>

111
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,664
But he created you.

112
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:09,699
To him, we're just servants.

113
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:11,400
Cannon fodder.

114
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:15,371
If Lucifer manages
to exterminate humankind...

115
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:18,908
we're next.

116
00:07:19,944 --> 00:07:22,112
So...

117
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:23,513
Help me.

118
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:24,580
Huh?

119
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:27,517
Let's all go back
to simpler, better times.

120
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:30,586
Back to... when we could all
follow our natures.

121
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:32,689
I'm in sales, damn it.

122
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:34,691
So, what do you say?

123
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:36,826
What if...

124
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:38,662
I give you this thing...

125
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:40,930
And you go kill the devil?

126
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:49,172
Okay.

127
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,573
Great.

128
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:56,179
You wouldn't
happen to know

129
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:59,049
<i>where the devil is,
by chance, would you?</i>

130
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,717
Thursday.

131
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,786
Birdies tell me...

132
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,521
He has an appointment
in Carthage, Missouri.

133
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,093
Great.

134
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:11,127
Thanks.

135
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,371
Oh, yeah, right. You probably
need some more ammunition.

136
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:26,509
Uh, excuse me
for asking,

137
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:28,644
But aren't you kind of signing
your own death warrant?

138
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:31,380
I mean, what happens to you

139
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:34,283
If we go up against 
the devil and lose?

140
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:36,986
Number one... he's gonna
wipe us all out anyway.

141
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:38,755
Two... after you leave here,

142
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,624
I go on an extended vacation
to all points nowhere.

143
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:44,094
And three... how about 
you don't miss?!

144
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:45,528
Okay?!

145
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:47,496
Morons!

146
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,479
All right, big boy.
Let's go.

147
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:18,928
I think I'm starting
to feel something.

148
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:22,866
It's got to be
a trap, right?

149
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:27,036
Sam Winchester having
trust issues with a demon.

150
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:28,805
Well, better late than never.

151
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,308
Yeah, and thank you again
for your continued support.

152
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:33,342
You're welcome.

153
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:39,649
And, you know,
trap or no trap,

154
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:42,385
We got a snowball's chance,
we got to take it, right?

155
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:46,122
Yeah, I suppose.

156
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:48,424
<i>Besides, I'm not sure
it is a trap.</i>

157
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,525
Check it out.

158
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,461
Carthage is lit up
like a Christmas tree

159
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:55,098
With revelation omens.

160
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:56,732
And look at this

161
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:59,235
there's been six 
missing persons reported

162
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,237
In town, since Sunday.

163
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,607
I think the devil's there.

164
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:07,076
Okay.

165
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:09,279
Look, when you think about it...

166
00:10:11,515 --> 00:10:13,049
you can't come with.

167
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,150
Dean...

168
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:17,653
Look, I go against Satan
and screw the pooch...

169
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:19,255
Okay.

170
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,925
We've lost a game piece,
that we can take.

171
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,293
<i>But if you're there...</i>

172
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:27,130
Then we are handing the devil's
vessel right over to him.

173
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:28,331
That's not smart.

174
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:29,966
Since when have we ever
done anything smart?

175
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,434
I'm serious, Sam.

176
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:32,735
So am I.

177
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:34,470
Haven't we learned
a damn thing?

178
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:38,607
<i>If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it together.</i>

179
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:48,084
Okay.

180
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,987
That's, a stupid friggin' idea.

181
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:02,465
Boy, talk about
stupid ideas.

182
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:04,734
Good god.

183
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:06,602
True, that.

184
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:12,708
Mm.

185
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:14,210
- Hey.
- Hey.

186
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:19,048
So...

187
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,351
Dangerous mission
tomorrow.

188
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:22,352
Mm.

189
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:24,453
Guess it's time to...

190
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:27,556
Eat, drink, and...
you know...

191
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:28,892
Make merry.

192
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:32,695
Are you giving me the
"Last night on earth", speech?

193
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:33,863
What?

194
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:34,663
What?

195
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:36,165
No.

196
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,333
No.

197
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:42,038
<i>If I was, would, uh...
w-would that work?</i>

198
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,918
No.

199
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:57,720
Sweetheart, if this is
our last night on earth,

200
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:59,455
Then I'm going to spend it

201
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:02,325
With a little thing
I call, "self-respect."

202
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:07,363
If you're into
that kind of thing.

203
00:12:07,398 --> 00:12:09,565
Everybody, get in here!

204
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,567
It's time for the line-up.

205
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:13,369
Usual suspects,
in the corner.

206
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:15,004
Oh, come on, Bobby.

207
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,973
Nobody wants
their picture taken.

208
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:18,041
Hear, hear.

209
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:20,443
<i>Shut up.
you're drinkin' my beer.</i>

210
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:23,146
Anyway...

211
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,483
I'm gonna need something
to remember your sorry asses by.

212
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:28,617
Ha!

213
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:31,487
Always good
to have an optimist around.

214
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:32,755
Bobby's right.

215
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:34,590
Tomorrow we hunt the devil.

216
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,892
This is our last night on earth.

217
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,130
You getting a signal?

218
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:15,865
No, nothin'.

219
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,034
Nice and spooky.

220
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:28,744
Place seem
a little empty to you?

221
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,112
We're gonna go
check out the PD.

222
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,114
You guys stay here,
see if you can find anybody.

223
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,783
Okay.

224
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:48,198
Ever heard of
a door handle?

225
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:49,832
Of course I have.

226
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,071
What is it, Cass?

227
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:57,073
This town's not empty.

228
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:03,813
Reapers.

229
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:07,783
"Reapers"? As in more than one?

230
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:11,921
They only gather like this
at times of great catastrophe...

231
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:15,057
Chicago fire,
San Francisco quake...

232
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:16,659
Pompeii.

233
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:18,961
Excuse me. I need to find out
why they're here.

234
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,080
Hello, brother.

235
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:17,387
Station's empty.

236
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:18,621
So is everything else.

237
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:19,756
Have you seen, Cass?

238
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,424
<i>What?
He was with you.</i>

239
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,326
Nope. He went after
the reapers.

240
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,494
Reapers?

241
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:26,162
He saw reapers, Where?

242
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:28,464
Well, kind of...
everywhere.

243
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:48,484
Lucifer.

244
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,323
So, I take it you're here
with the Winchesters.

245
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:57,259
I came alone.

246
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:00,229
Loyalty.

247
00:16:01,532 --> 00:16:03,933
Such a nice quality to see
in this day and age.

248
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:07,370
"Castiel," right?

249
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,941
Castiel...

250
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:14,844
I'm told you came here
in an auto mobile.

251
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,614
Yes.

252
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:19,915
What was that like?

253
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,051
Um...

254
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:23,085
Slow.

255
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:25,955
Confining.

256
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:28,190
What a peculiar 
thing you are.

257
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:32,895
What's wrong
with your vessel?

258
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:36,165
Yes, um...

259
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:39,335
Nick is wearing a 
bit thin, I'm afraid.

260
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,838
He can't contain me
forever, so...

261
00:16:41,872 --> 00:16:43,138
You...

262
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:50,880
You are not taking
Sam Winchester.

263
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:54,116
I won't let you.

264
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,150
Castiel.

265
00:16:56,987 --> 00:17:00,356
<i>I don't understand
why you're fighting me,</i>

266
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:01,457
Of all the angels.

267
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:02,859
You really have to ask?

268
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:05,027
I rebelled, I was cast out.

269
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:08,130
<i>You rebelled.
You were cast out.</i>

270
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:10,533
Almost all of heaven
wants to see me dead,

271
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:13,269
and if they succeed,
guess what?

272
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:17,139
You're their new public 
enemy number one.

273
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,044
We're on the same side,
like it or not, so...

274
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,447
Why not just serve
your own best interests?

275
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:26,949
Which, in this case,
just happen to be mine.

276
00:17:28,752 --> 00:17:30,953
I'll die first.

277
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:38,394
I suppose you will.

278
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:47,269
Well, this is great. we've been
in town for 20 minutes.

279
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:49,639
We've already lost
the angel up our sleeve.

280
00:17:49,673 --> 00:17:51,674
You think, uh...
you think Lucifer got him?

281
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,176
<i>I don't know
what else to think.</i>

282
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,079
There you are.

283
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:00,483
Meg!

284
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:03,719
You shouldn't have
come here, boys.

285
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:06,589
<i>Yeah? well, I could say
the same thing for you.</i>

286
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:09,792
Didn't come 
here alone, Dean-o.

287
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:19,569
Hell hounds!

288
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:21,704
Yeah, Dean...
your favourite.

289
00:18:22,906 --> 00:18:24,006
Come on, boys.

290
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,508
My father
wants to see you.

291
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,042
I think we'll pass. Thanks.

292
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:28,377
Your call.

293
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,745
You can make this easy,

294
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,281
or you can make it
really, really hard.

295
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:40,422
When have you known us
to ever make anything easy?

296
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:45,027
Run!

297
00:18:55,472 --> 00:18:56,739
Dean!

298
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:57,840
Jo, stay back!

299
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:06,949
No!

300
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:08,450
Aaaaah!

301
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:24,166
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

302
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:28,170
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

303
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:29,471
I'm fine. I'm fine.

304
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:30,840
Boys, need some help here!

305
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,845
You all right?

306
00:19:52,095 --> 00:19:53,228
Ohhh!

307
00:19:53,263 --> 00:19:54,697
Ohh!

308
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,505
Ohhh...

309
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:10,674
It'll be all right. Okay?
You're gonna be all right.

310
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,675
Thank you.

311
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:15,644
How's she holding up?

312
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:23,487
The salt lines
are holding up.

313
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,154
Safe for now.

314
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:26,859
Yeah, safe
or trapped like rats.

315
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,494
Hey, you heard Meg.

316
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,463
Her father's here.

317
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,565
This is our one shot, Sammy.

318
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,933
We got to take it,
no matter what.

319
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,637
There we go.

320
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:42,372
Sam, some help here, please?

321
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,775
<i>The number you dialled
is unavailable.</i>

322
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,910
<i>please try your call again...</i>

323
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:48,645
Damn it, boys.

324
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,627
KC5 Fox Delta Oscar,
go ahead.

325
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:07,063
Bobby, it's Dean.
we got problems.

326
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:12,336
It's okay, boy.
that's why I'm here.

327
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,271
Is everyone all right?

328
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,073
No.

329
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:18,408
Uh, I-It's...

330
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,644
It's Jo. Bobby, it's pretty bad.

331
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:26,483
Okay. Copy that.

332
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,752
So now we figure
what we do next.

333
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:32,722
Bobby, I don't think she's...

334
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:41,231
I said,
"what do we do next," Dean.

335
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:48,672
Right.

336
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:50,807
Okay. Right.

337
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:54,278
Now... tell me what you got.

338
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:58,882
Before he went missing,
did Cass say how many reapers?

339
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,384
I-I don't know.

340
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:01,552
He said a lot of things, I guess.

341
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,653
I mean, does the number matter?

342
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,322
Devil's in the details, Dean.

343
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:09,226
Bobby, it's Ellen.

344
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,494
The way he was looking,

345
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:12,729
The number of places
Castiel's eyes went,

346
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:15,365
I'd say we're talking over a 
dozen reapers, probably more.

347
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:20,136
I do not like
the sound of that.

348
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:23,240
Nobody likes the 
sound of that, Bobby, but...

349
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:25,576
<i>what... what does 
that sound like?</i>

350
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,911
It sounds like death, son.

351
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:30,814
I think Satan's in town
to work a ritual.

352
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:35,151
I think he's planning
to unleash death.

353
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,756
You mean like, as in this dude 
and taxes are the only sure thing?

354
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:44,428
<i>As in death... The Horseman,
the pale rider in the flesh.</i>

355
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:45,696
"Unleash"?

356
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,064
I mean, h-hasn't death been
tromping all over the place?

357
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:49,933
I mean, hell, I died
several times myself.

358
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,167
Not this guy.

359
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:53,770
<i>This is... this is
the angel of death,</i>

360
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:55,071
Big daddy reaper.

361
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:58,174
They keep this guy chained
in a box 600 feet under.

362
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:01,878
Last time they hauled him up,
Noah was building a boat.

363
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,149
That's why the place
is crawling with reapers.

364
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:08,818
They're waiting
on the big boss to show.

365
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,526
<i>You have
any other good news?</i>

366
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,562
Well, in a manner of speaking.

367
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:22,532
I've been researching Carthage
since you've been gone,

368
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,700
Trying to suss out

369
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,302
what the devil
might want there.

370
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:28,605
What you just said drops the 
last piece of the puzzle in place.

371
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,075
The angel of death must 
be brought into this world

372
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:35,279
at midnight through a place
of awful carnage.

373
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,913
Now, back during the civil war,

374
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:38,649
there was a battle
in Carthage...

375
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,783
a battle so intense,

376
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:42,419
the soldiers called it
"The battle of hell-hole."

377
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,322
Where'd the massacre go down?

378
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:49,359
On the land of 
William Jasper's farm.

379
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:00,170
I got the Winchesters
pinned down...

380
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:02,071
For now, at least.

381
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:04,107
What should I do
with them?

382
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:06,610
Leave them alone.

383
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:09,446
I-I'm sorry,
but are you sure?

384
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,447
Shouldn't we...

385
00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:12,649
Trust me, child.

386
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,051
Everything happens
for a reason.

387
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,824
Well, Castiel...

388
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:23,259
You have some time.

389
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,263
Time to change your mind.

390
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:35,104
So, now we know
where the devil's gonna be,

391
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:37,441
we know when,
and we have the colt.

392
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,642
Yeah.

393
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:41,645
We just have to get past...
eight or so hell hounds

394
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,513
and get to the 
farm by midnight.

395
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:47,283
Yeah, and that's after we get 
Jo and Ellen the hell out of town.

396
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:49,519
Won't be easy.

397
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,520
Stretcher?

398
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,121
I'll see what we got.

399
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,024
Stop.

400
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:56,793
Guys, stop.

401
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:02,999
Can we, uh, be realistic
about this, please?

402
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,276
I can't move my legs.

403
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,711
I can't be moved.

404
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:19,549
My guts are being held in
by an ace bandage.

405
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,752
We got to...

406
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,053
We got to get our 
priorities straight here.

407
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:30,894
Number one...
I'm not going anywhere.

408
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:33,196
Joanna Beth, you stop
talking like that...

409
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,297
Mom.

410
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,768
I can't fight.

411
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,836
I can't walk.

412
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,706
<i>But I can do something.</i>

413
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,710
We've got propane, wiring,
rock salt, iron nails...

414
00:25:46,744 --> 00:25:48,545
Everything we need.

415
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:51,047
Everything we need?

416
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:52,682
To build a bomb, Sam.

417
00:25:55,052 --> 00:25:56,019
No!

418
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:57,721
Jo... no.

419
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,423
You got another plan?

420
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,358
<i>you got any other plan?</i>

421
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:06,563
Those are hell hounds
out there, Dean.

422
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:12,402
They've got
all of our scents.

423
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:17,407
<i>Those bitches will never
stop coming after you.</i>

424
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,614
We let the dogs in,

425
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,282
you guys hit the roof,

426
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:28,652
make a break for 
the building next over,

427
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:31,488
and I can wait here
with my finger on the button.

428
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:34,290
Rip those mutts
a new one.

429
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:37,293
Or at least get you a few
minutes' head start, anyway.

430
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,832
No, I... I won't let you.

431
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,133
This is why we're here, right?

432
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:47,471
If I can get us
a shot on the devil...

433
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:50,907
Dean, we have to take it.

434
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,075
No!

435
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,077
That's not...

436
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:55,445
Mom.

437
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,714
<i>This might literally be</i>

438
00:26:57,748 --> 00:27:00,149
your last chance
to treat me like an adult.

439
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,353
You might want
to take it.

440
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,642
You heard her.

441
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:27,978
Get to work.

442
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:20,229
Okay, this is it.

443
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,300
I'll see you
on the other side.

444
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:28,237
Probably sooner than later.

445
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:32,842
Make it later.

446
00:29:16,186 --> 00:29:17,153
Okay.

447
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:45,649
Mom, no.

448
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,851
Somebody's
got to let them in,

449
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:51,420
and like you said,
you're not moving.

450
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:55,558
<i>You got me, Jo.</i>

451
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,529
And you're right

452
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:01,097
<i>this is important.</i>

453
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,768
But I will not
leave you here alone.

454
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:08,538
Dean?

455
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:10,373
Get goin' now, boys.

456
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:11,675
Ellen?

457
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,277
I said go,

458
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:18,915
and, Dean...

459
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:22,451
Kick it in the ass.

460
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:26,156
Don't miss.

461
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:13,803
I will always love you, baby.

462
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,839
I...

463
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,013
Honey?

464
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:27,884
Jo...

465
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:37,927
It's okay.

466
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,230
It's okay.

467
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:43,066
That's my good girl.

468
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,596
You can go straight back
to hell, you ugly bitch!

469
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:44,427
I guess we know what happened
to some of the towns people.

470
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:47,230
Okay.

471
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:49,065
Okay.

472
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,700
Last words?

473
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,210
I think I'm good.

474
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,180
Yeah. Me too.

475
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:11,287
Here goes nothin'.

476
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,734
Hey!

477
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,874
You wanted to see me?!

478
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,379
Well, Sam, you don't
need that gun here.

479
00:33:39,216 --> 00:33:41,684
You know I'd never hurt you.

480
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:43,052
Not really.

481
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:47,023
Yeah?

482
00:33:47,057 --> 00:33:48,524
<i>Well, I'd hurt you.</i>

483
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:51,861
So suck it.

484
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:13,716
Owww!

485
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:23,793
Where did you get that?

486
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:35,271
Now...

487
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,672
Where were we?

488
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:44,073
Don't feel too bad, Sam.

489
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:47,456
There's only five things
in all of creation

490
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,724
That, that gun can't kill,

491
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:51,360
and... I just happen to be
one of them.

492
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:55,097
But if you give me a minute,
I'm almost done.

493
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:01,771
You know...

494
00:35:03,273 --> 00:35:06,575
I don't suppose you'd just
say "yes" right here and now?

495
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:10,146
End this whole
tiresome discussion?

496
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,713
That's crazy, right?

497
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:13,849
<i>It's never gonna happen!</i>

498
00:35:13,884 --> 00:35:15,550
Oh, I don't know, Sam.

499
00:35:15,585 --> 00:35:17,086
I think it will.

500
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,721
I think it'll happen soon...

501
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:21,891
Within six months.

502
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:24,894
And I think it'll 
happen... in Detroit.

503
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:28,864
You listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

504
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:31,033
I'm gonna kill you myself.

505
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:32,835
You understand me?

506
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:35,437
I'm going to
rip your heart out!

507
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:36,839
That's good, Sam.

508
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:40,109
You keep fanning 
that fire in your belly...

509
00:35:40,143 --> 00:35:41,944
All that pent-up rage.

510
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:44,713
I'm gonna need it.

511
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:50,052
What did you do?

512
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:51,620
What did you do
to this town?

513
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:54,256
Oh, I was very generous
with this town.

514
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:57,126
One demon for 
every able-bodied man.

515
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,760
And the rest of them?

516
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:03,398
In there.

517
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:09,038
I know... it's awful, but...

518
00:36:09,072 --> 00:36:11,040
These horsemen
are so demanding.

519
00:36:11,074 --> 00:36:15,610
So it was... women and children first.

520
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,517
I know what you must
think of me, Sam.

521
00:36:23,854 --> 00:36:25,921
<i>But I have to do this.</i>

522
00:36:25,956 --> 00:36:27,789
<i>I have to.</i>

523
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:30,025
You, of all people,
should understand.

524
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:33,729
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

525
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:38,800
I was a son.

526
00:36:38,835 --> 00:36:40,635
A brother, like you.

527
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,338
A younger brother,

528
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:45,741
and I had an older 
brother who I loved.

529
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:47,476
Idolized, in fact.

530
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,245
And one day,
I went to him

531
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:52,814
and I begged him
to stand with me,

532
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:55,550
and Michael...

533
00:36:57,187 --> 00:37:00,155
Michael turned on me.

534
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,957
Called me a freak.

535
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:05,027
A monster,

536
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:07,796
and then he beat me down.

537
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,165
All because
I was different.

538
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,768
Because I had
a mind of my own.

539
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:15,771
Tell me something, Sam.

540
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:18,340
Any of this
sound familiar?

541
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:23,612
Anyway...

542
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:27,516
You'll have to excuse me.
Midnight is calling

543
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,952
and I have a ritual to finish.

544
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:31,120
Don't go anywhere.

545
00:37:31,154 --> 00:37:33,622
Not that you could
if you would.

546
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:51,340
Now, repeat after me.

547
00:37:51,374 --> 00:37:55,911
We offer up our lives, blood, souls...

548
00:37:55,946 --> 00:38:00,082
we offer up
our lives, blood, souls...

549
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:04,284
- To complete this tribute.
- To complete this tribute.

550
00:38:18,435 --> 00:38:19,801
What?

551
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:28,010
They're just demons.

552
00:38:37,787 --> 00:38:39,254
You seem pleased.

553
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,591
We're gonna win.

554
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,460
Can you feel it?

555
00:38:46,762 --> 00:38:50,199
You cloud-hopping pansies
lost the whole damn universe.

556
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:54,136
Lucifer's gonna take over heaven.

557
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,538
We're goin' to heaven, Clarence.

558
00:38:58,174 --> 00:38:59,174
Strange.

559
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:01,176
Because I heard
a different theory

560
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:02,878
from a demon
named Crowley.

561
00:39:04,347 --> 00:39:05,714
You don't know Crowley.

562
00:39:05,748 --> 00:39:08,950
He believes that Lucifer
is just using demons

563
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:10,986
to achieve an end,

564
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:12,187
and that...

565
00:39:13,356 --> 00:39:15,057
once he does...

566
00:39:15,892 --> 00:39:18,227
he'll destroy you all.

567
00:39:18,261 --> 00:39:19,561
You're wrong.

568
00:39:19,595 --> 00:39:22,164
Lucifer is the father of our race...

569
00:39:22,198 --> 00:39:23,765
Our creator.

570
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:27,869
<i>Your god may be a 
deadbeat, but mine...</i>

571
00:39:27,904 --> 00:39:29,405
Mine walks the earth.

572
00:39:41,717 --> 00:39:44,953
You can't gank demons, can you?

573
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:46,955
You're cut off
from the home office,

574
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:49,658
and you ain't got the juice.

575
00:39:49,692 --> 00:39:53,395
<i>So, what can you do,
you impotent sap?</i>

576
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:57,132
I can do this.

577
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:38,340
Oh, hello, death.

578
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:47,341
Just received an update
as the governor has declared

579
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:49,142
<i>a state of emergency
for Paulding County,</i>

580
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:52,978
<i>including the towns of Marion,
Fayetteville, and Carthage.</i>

581
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:55,614
<i>the storm system
has reportedly touched off</i>

582
00:40:55,648 --> 00:40:57,482
<i>a number of tornadoes
in the area.</i>

583
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:59,484
<i>death tolls have 
yet to be estimated.</i>

584
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,054
<i>but state officials expect
the loss of life and property</i>

585
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:04,055
<i>To be staggering.</i>
