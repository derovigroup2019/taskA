1
00:00:02,591 --> 00:00:04,842
You can't just look me in the
face and tell me you're fine.

2
00:00:04,877 --> 00:00:06,328
You're not sleeping,
you drink for the record.

3
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:07,359
Just be honest with me.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,578
How are those
the actions of someone

5
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:09,816
who knows
they did the right thing?

6
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,350
You lied to me,
and you killed my friend.

7
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:12,518
Killing Amy
was not wrong.

8
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:14,571
You couldn't do it,
so I did.

9
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:17,040
You know, I can't even
be around you right now.

10
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:18,492
You might as well bite
the bullet and work

11
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:19,717
with me on this one.
I don't know if I can.

12
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,878
I'm just saying, let's try
and stop the killings.

13
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:23,216
That's your stuff.

14
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:25,195
Yeah. Yeah.
I figured we' take one car.

15
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,521
Look, you know what.

16
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:28,032
You were right, about Amy.

17
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:29,288
I get why you did it.
You were just trying

18
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:30,647
to make sure no else got hurt.

19
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:33,944
"Supernatural."

20
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:35,112
You're saying
this is a <i>book?</i>

21
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:36,530
Books.
It was a series.

22
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:38,532
Didn't sell
a lot of copies, though.

23
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:41,185
Chuck, I am
your number-one fan.

24
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,404
But I know that "Supernatural"
is just a book, okay?

25
00:00:43,438 --> 00:00:45,572
<i>Becky, it's all real.</i>
I <i>knew</i> it!

26
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,075
- You okay, lady?
- Is it really you?

27
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:52,296
- Can you... Quit touching me?
- No.

28
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:54,081
Um...

29
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:03,190
Okay,
you won't believe it.

30
00:01:03,224 --> 00:01:05,258
People think I just say it
to get a bigger tip.

31
00:01:05,276 --> 00:01:06,593
Try me.

32
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:08,929
Fine.
I'm in grad school.

33
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:11,949
See? Okay?
There's a look.

34
00:01:11,983 --> 00:01:13,650
Okay? Stop.

35
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:16,487
No, this is my
"I dig smart chicks" look.

36
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:18,489
Now, if they, uh,
if they wore that, I...

37
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,324
I wouldn't have
dropped out of school.

38
00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:24,078
So, what's your deal?

39
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:25,129
My deal?

40
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:26,413
Yeah. Okay?

41
00:01:26,447 --> 00:01:28,415
You came in here looking like
somebody shot your puppy.

42
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,970
Well, things are looking up
now that your shift's over.

43
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,391
All right.

44
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:39,226
Uh, here's the deal.

45
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,462
I have this friend.
He's got this younger brother.

46
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,814
Right?
Cannon's a little loose.

47
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:45,482
You know, his reactor blew
a while back.

48
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:47,184
It's not good. Um...

49
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:50,738
My friend -- he's, uh...
He's kind of been sitting,

50
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:52,773
waiting to see
if he goes guano again.

51
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:55,159
And I assume
it just hit the fan?

52
00:01:55,193 --> 00:01:56,944
Well, that's the thing.
It didn't.

53
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:58,612
The kid's
all reasonable now,

54
00:01:58,646 --> 00:02:00,030
considering he's crazy.

55
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:03,033
Well, he's --
I mean, he's not crazy. He --

56
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:05,836
he's starting to seem like things
might be getting a little better.

57
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,704
Well, that's a good thing,
right?

58
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:09,289
It's a freakin' miracle.

59
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:11,041
Except...

60
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:13,210
When it happens
during their, uh...

61
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:16,013
Their sacred annual
pilgrimage to Vegas...

62
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:18,966
And he goes off
on some granola-munching hike

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,184
in the desert by himself.

64
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,388
Well, maybe he just needs
some time alone.

65
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,140
Yeah.

66
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:29,009
We all need
to face ourselves sometime.

67
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:30,694
Maybe he does.

68
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:33,030
Wasn't talking about him.

69
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:37,701
Excuse me.

70
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,205
Speak of the devil.

71
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:42,489
He's four blocks away?

72
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:48,078
See? Baby bro
needs you after all.

73
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:28,919
Dean.

74
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:32,239
It's okay.
You won't need that.

75
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:33,674
Come on.
I thought you were out,

76
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,926
uh, becoming one
with the land or some crap.

77
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,544
You got to --
come here.

78
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:38,595
All right.

79
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,763
Now...

80
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,717
Hi.

81
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:44,768
What is this?

82
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:47,254
Uh, apparently, uh,
pink is for loyalty.

83
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:48,772
All right,
so, what's the pretext?

84
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,557
What are we --
uh, wedding crashers, huh?

85
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:53,143
We lookin' for some kind
of siren or what?

86
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:56,096
No. Nothing like that.
All right, um...

87
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:57,814
So, a little sudden.

88
00:03:57,899 --> 00:04:01,535
But life is short,
so I'll keep this shorter.

89
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:02,619
I'm in love.

90
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:05,389
And I'm getting married.

91
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:09,877
Say something, like, uh,

92
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,795
like, "congratulations,"
for example.

93
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:14,965
What?

94
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:18,919
[ Wagner's "Bridal Chorus"
plays ]

95
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,453
What the hell?

96
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:38,522
Becky?

97
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:40,073
Dean.

98
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:42,276
I'm so glad
you're here.

101
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:07,030
Shouldn't she ask for my
permission or something?

102
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:10,383
Y-you want her
to ask for my hand?

103
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:13,002
How in the --

104
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,054
How did this happen?

105
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,339
Short version?

106
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,608
We -- we -- we met.

107
00:05:18,642 --> 00:05:21,528
We ate and -- and talked
and fell in love.

108
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:24,013
And, you know,
here we are.

109
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:26,015
Yeah, I-I guess
I'm all caught up.

110
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,450
That's -- okay.

111
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:31,321
You know what?
Ignoring everything...

112
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:33,656
Have you forgotten the average
life-span of your hookups?

113
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,757
Yeah, but --

114
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,360
but if anyone knows that,
it's <i>me.</i>

115
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,696
I mean,
I read every book.

116
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:43,049
So, open eyes, you know?

117
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,001
Open eyes.

118
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:46,586
I'm gonna be sick.

119
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,421
Dean, look,
it's simple.

120
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:50,540
I-if something good's happening,
I-I got to jump on it --

121
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,642
now, today, period.

122
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:54,477
Okay, "Dead Poets Society."
Fine.

123
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,564
No offense -- did you make
sure she's even really --

124
00:05:57,598 --> 00:06:01,100
Salt, holy water,
everything.

125
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,335
See?

126
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:03,736
Not a monster.

127
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:05,721
Just the right girl
for your brother.

128
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:06,573
Ah.

129
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:07,524
That's it.

130
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:08,775
The bill.

131
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,826
I got it.

132
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:13,363
You two
do your brother thing.

133
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:21,287
Really?!
Superfan ninety-nine?!

134
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:22,872
Dean, look.

135
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:25,458
Honest to God, I-I had the exact
same opinion of her as you do.

136
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,094
But when we got past
the whole book thing,

137
00:06:28,128 --> 00:06:30,746
I found out t-that she's great
and I was the dick.

138
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:33,216
Yeah, you know, speaking
of the whole, uh, book thing...

139
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,385
Becky <i>randomly</i> shows up
during Vegas week?

140
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,103
Yeah.

141
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:38,254
Yeah.

142
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:41,891
Okay, um,
what are you trying to say?

143
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,027
I'm saying maybe she knew
you were gonna be here.

144
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:47,263
Maybe, uh, uh, uh,
Chuck wrote about it.

145
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,282
- Dean, you're paranoid.
- And you're in love?!

146
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:51,034
It's been four days, man!

147
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:52,702
You know what, Dean?
You know what?

148
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:54,704
Um, how about this?

149
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:56,823
Becky and I are gonna go up
to her place in Delaware.

150
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,958
Um, why don't you try and wrap
your dome around this,

151
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:02,212
get a little supportive,
then give us a call?

152
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,748
"First official Tweet

153
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:11,471
as Mrs. Becky
Rosen-Winchester."

154
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:24,017
Bobby. Hey, I know you're, uh,
beard-deep in that Oregon nest.

155
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,403
I am headed to Delaware
to do a little snoop around.

156
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:29,689
Sam is there with his wife.

157
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,141
That's right. You heard me.
His wife.

158
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:34,143
Call me.

159
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:44,170
I thought we just ate.

160
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:45,838
Quick stop.

161
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:47,624
Well, is that my fault?

162
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:49,509
I told you we had tickets
11 times.

163
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:50,677
Hi, Jocelyn.

164
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:51,894
Let me call you back.

165
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,380
Just get a sitter.
It's not calculus.

166
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,966
Yes.
Can I help you?

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,669
It's Becky.
Becky Rosen.

168
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,354
Ohh!

169
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:02,689
"Yechie Becky."

170
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:05,108
Ha. Long time ago.

171
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:07,727
? Yechie Becky ?

172
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,228
Ohh!

173
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,030
Well, you look just the same,
don't you?

174
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:13,483
I'm here to R.S.V.P.
for the reunion,

175
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:14,534
if it's not too late.

176
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:19,122
No, no, there is always room

Actually...

178

It's Rosen-Winchester.

179
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:27,029
So mark me down

Hi, guy!

182
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,513
You're back!

183
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,732
How was Vegas?

184
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:47,567
It was awesome!

185
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:49,352
Really?
Really?

186
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:50,553
Guy...

187
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,221
Meet my husband...

188
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,606
Sam.

189
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:55,074
Hey.

190
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,611
It's an honor
to meet you, Sam.

191
00:08:58,662 --> 00:08:59,779
Thanks. You too.

192
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,564
Guy's a really good
friend.

193
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,733
We met in the erotic horror
section at the novel hovel.

194
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,119
Oh, my God, Becky.
Come on!

195

T.M.I.

196
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:08,838
Poor guy's
just met me.

197
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:10,423
No, it's okay.
Nice to meet you.

198
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:12,241
Look,
any friend of Becky's...

199
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:17,013
Anyway, I should,
uh, get back to it,

200
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:18,715
or this party's
not gonna happen, right?

201
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:20,850
Sure.

202
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:22,135
Guy's an event planner.

203
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,437
Reunion season
is very busy for him.

204
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:25,521
Hold on one sec?

205
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,925
One more thing.

206
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:31,194
You get my message?

207
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:33,613
Of course.
I thought you'd never ask.

208
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:35,598
Give me a hug.

209
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:41,371
I swear, if everyone had
a Wiccan in their pocket,

210
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:42,989
the world would be
a happier place.

211
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,124
It is nothing.

212
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,410
Blessed be, sweetie.

I use to describe ?

Wow.

Uh...

239
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:46,746
Yeah, yeah, of course.

I actually don't know how
to use it. Are we good?

255
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:15,957
Good, 'cause I'm sniffing
a case in this town.

00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:28,252
his <i>face</i> was
the catcher's mitt, huh?

261
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:30,471
Our first thought
was crossroads demons,

262
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:34,291
but there's that 10-year
time frame on collecting souls.

263
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:37,795
Then there's cursed object,
like in "Bad day at Black Rock,"

264
00:13:37,813 --> 00:13:40,398
but we haven't been able
to connect the vics yet.

265
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:42,850
You're working this case...
Together?

266
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:44,969
Yeah.
I know. Right?

267
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:48,489
I mean, I guess all those
Chuck Shurley books paid off.

268
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:51,025
All right, listen, Cookie, I don't know
what kind of mojo you're working,

269
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:52,693
but, believe me,
I will find out.

270
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:55,279
Dean, that's...my wife
you're talking to.

271
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:57,147
You're not even acting
like yourself, Sam!

272
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,533
How am I not?

273
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:00,201
You married
Becky Rosen!

I'm a witch?

276
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:05,122
Or maybe I'm a siren.

Guy wins the lotto,
guy hits the bigs.

281
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,334
All right, obviously,

282
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:19,270
uh, people's dreams are
coming true in this town.

283
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:21,389
Don't you think this is
a little bit of a coincidence?

284
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,857
You know what, Dean?

285
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:25,276
What Becky and I have
is real.

286
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,894
And if you can't accept that,

287
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:28,746
that's <i>your</i> problem,
not ours.

288
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,398
Or maybe
she's part of it.

289
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:33,534
Because for whatever reason,
you're <i>her</i> dream.

290
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:36,654
If you really do care about her,
I'd be worried.

291
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:38,372
Because people who do get

292
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:40,524
their little fantasies
or whatever

293
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,126
seem to end up dead
pretty quick.

294
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:44,545
You know,
I went after <i>her,</i> Dean.

295
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,548
Maybe that's
what's bugging you --

296
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,717
that I'm moving on
with my life.

297
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:51,886
I mean, you took care of me,
and that's great.

298
00:14:53,972 --> 00:14:56,540
But I don't need you
anymore.

299
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:11,072
I don't want another hunter,
Bobby. Why can't <i>you</i> do it?

300
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:16,060
Fine.

Hmm. I thought
you'd be taller.

318
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:06,303
I assume Bobby filled you in
on the road.

319
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:08,305
He told me two things.

320
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,340
One, he's tangling
with a major-league nest

322
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,194
Numero dos,

323
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:16,280
he said you'd be all,
uh, surly and premenstrual

324
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:17,865
working with me.

325
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:21,118

Oh, Marmaduke,
you're crazy!

330
00:17:46,878 --> 00:17:49,597
Are you trying
to humiliate me?

331
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:52,066
It's Marsha
with an "s-h-a,"

332
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,052
not a "c-i-a."

333
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:58,689
Thanks again.

00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:02,326
- Hey, is that your --
- Yes.

335
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,745
Awkward.

336

00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,705
So, uh, no point in going in.
Guy's clean.

340
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:15,873
You sure?

341
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:17,925
Yeah. Positive.
Becky grilled him like a pro.

342
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,127
- She's a real natural.
- Huh.

W-what's with
the scrawny guy?

00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:25,415
Temp.

Throw a rock, hit a reporter
these days, eh?

346
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:39,930
Well,
your story's a big deal

347
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:42,233
over at the, uh,

00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:43,784
Go ahead. Shoot.

351
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:49,323
Board came to me, asked.
Said yes.

352
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:50,624
Just out of the blue?

353
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:52,326
Pretty much.

354
00:18:52,377 --> 00:18:55,329
Huh. And, uh, any idea
how the board landed on you

355
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,915
over your supervisors?

356
00:18:57,949 --> 00:19:00,618
Um, they didn't say.

357
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:02,636
Could you tell us what
specifically excited the board

358
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:04,788
about your actual
qualifications?

359
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:07,475
Say, fellas,
what's with the third degree?

360
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:08,843
Oh, uh, no offense.

361
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:10,511
We were just wondering
if you got here

362
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:11,645
by nefarious means.

363
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,963
Whoa! Garth!

364
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:15,699
Oh.

365
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:19,303
Uh, I-I didn't mean,
of course, uh,

366
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:20,771
corporate backstabbing --
I'm sorry.

367
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:22,606
I meant more like,

368
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,159
uh, you know,
black magic or hoodoo.

369
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:27,862
Ha ha ha ha! Ohh!

370
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:30,447
He jokes. He's a --
he's a jokester.

371
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:31,499
Let's, uh, rewind.

372
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:32,950
Why don't, uh,
why don't you tell us

373
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:36,520
what it felt like when
your big dream came true?

374
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:42,326
Look, on the record,
it's great.

375
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:43,493
Off the record?

376
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:44,862
It's not my big dream.

377
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:47,097
Wait.
You didn't want this job?

378
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,133
Hell, no.
I'm a sales guy.

379
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,467
I was good in sales.

380
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,003
Your secretary's
an idiot.

381
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:55,055
I'll be at the printers
this afternoon.

382
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,174
All right, dear.
See you at dinner.

383
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,293
Just have the idiot
make a reservation.

384
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:02,062
Here's a tip -- remind her
she works for the C.E.O.

385
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,848
One more screw-up,
she's fired.

386
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:08,285
Your, uh, wife seems
pretty stoked

387
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,803
on the promotion,
don't she?

388
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:11,856
Honestly,
I've never seen her happier.

389
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,793
I have no idea how I'm gonna
tell her I have to resign.

390
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:17,494
- The news is just gonna --
- Kill her?

391
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:25,219
Mrs. Burrows? Hi.

392
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:26,303
Can I help you?

393
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:27,871
Yes, we're, uh,
we're doing a story

394
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:29,373
on your husband's
promotion.

395
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:30,808
Wanted to ask you
a few questions.

396
00:20:30,842 --> 00:20:32,843
I'm sorry. I can't today. If you
schedule it with his girl...

397
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:34,178
Okay, you know what?

398
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:37,264
I'm trying to save you
from a really bad accident.

399
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:39,266
Are you
threatening me?

400
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:40,651
No.

401
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:42,770
No, I-I'm pointing out
a pattern.

402
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:44,188
Why do people keep thinking
I'm threatening them?

403
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:47,324
Because it sounded exactly
like a threat, dude.

404
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,077
Look, for your own good, what
did you do to get him promoted?

405
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:53,414
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

406
00:20:53,448 --> 00:20:54,865
Now leave me alone.

407
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:57,901
Or do I have to
call security?

408
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:03,874
No, no, no,
something's not adding up.

409
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:07,127
I'm sure
we'll get a break.

410
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:09,913
"As soon
as we're done working,

411
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:13,717
romantic honeymoon
getaway."

412
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,450
Bring the damn car around.

413
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:33,287
I'm not walking five blocks
in my heels.

414
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:40,544
Aaaaah!

415
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:46,133
You okay?

416
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:49,336
How did you know?

417
00:21:49,387 --> 00:21:52,339
'Cause you're not the first.
Come on.

418
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,392
You want to tell us
what's up here?

419
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,980
I was having lunch
with friends.

420
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:01,732
This guy
heard me bitching.

421
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:03,651
Next thing I know,
he's making me an offer.

422
00:22:03,685 --> 00:22:05,302
An offer?

423
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,305
Craig's job
for my soul.

424
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:11,575
I know. Hilarious. I mean,
what have I got to lose?

425
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:13,110
Well, there's
your soul.

426
00:22:13,144 --> 00:22:15,812
What kind of demon deal is this?
Timeline's wack.

427
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:19,116
- What are you talking about? "Demon"?
- Let me back up here.

428
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,868
You made a deal
with a demon

429
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:22,870
in exchange
for your everlasting.

430
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:25,372
Except those
are 10-year contracts.

431
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:26,790
Why's the bill
coming due so fast?

432
00:22:26,824 --> 00:22:28,959
I don't know, but I got a bad
feeling about who's next.

433
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:30,210
We got to find Sam,
pronto.

434
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:32,662
All right, all right, all right.
Uh, here's the plan.

435
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:33,997
I drop this lady
at my cousin's.

436
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:35,516
He'll stop anything
trying to get her.

437
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,769
We, uh, find Sam,
hopefully fix this,

438
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:41,004
everybody's home in time
for "America's Got Talent."

439
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:42,439
Now, you --
you'll be living

440
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:44,341
with a triracial
paraplegic sniper

441
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,510
until this all
blows over, okay?

442
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:49,229
Guy, where are you?

443
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,948
We need to meet up, fast!

444
00:22:50,982 --> 00:22:52,900
I'm losing Sam.

445
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,851
Becky...

446
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:56,403
W-what's --
what's happening?

447
00:22:56,454 --> 00:22:59,523
Don't you remember?
We're married.

448
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,208
Oh, g--

449
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:03,410
I'm calling Dean.

450
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:27,406
Sam, do you feel
concussion-y?

451
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,241
How many fingers
am I holding up?

452
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:30,993
Where am I?
What the hell's going on?

453
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,245
Sam...
Just calm down.

454
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:35,614
Calm down?!
You hogtied me t--

455
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,284
Becky, why -- why am I not
wearing any pants?

456
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,453
- They're very constricting.
- Ohh!

457
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,956
Don't worry.
I didn't do anything weird.

458
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,156
I was helping.

459
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,708
Let me go. Now!

460
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,493
Are you thirsty?

461
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:51,046
Or do you need
a bottle...

462
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,464
To, you know, tinkle?

463
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,099
It's okay if you do.
I can help.

464
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,052
Finally!

465
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,937
Wait. What? Wait. Becky?
Becky. Hey, hey, don't!

466
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:00,672
Don't! Becky!

467
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:04,860
Where have you been?!

468
00:24:04,928 --> 00:24:06,862
<i>I got your messages.</i>
<i>Problem?</i>

469
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,363
Big problem.

470
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,348
I'm at my parents' cabin.

471
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,734
I've got Sam tied to a bed.

472
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,737
I'm out of elixir.
I need a refill, okay?

473
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,873
This isn't the honeymoon
I had in mind.

474
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,208
Well, some of it is,
but not in this context.

475
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,794
And is it just me, or is this stuff
wearing off faster and faster?!

476
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,030
<i>Becky...Breathe.</i>

477
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:32,754
Do you know we haven't even
consummated our marriage?

478
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:36,224
We were taking it slow
'cause true love is forever,

479
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,311
but everything
just feels weird now.

480
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,546
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Meet me in an hour.</i>

481
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:47,102
So you dosed me
with a love potion.

482
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,887
- How --
- Thin walls.

483
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:52,057
Look...

484
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:54,192
Yes, I used
a social lubricant to --

485
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,393
You roofied me!

486
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:58,330
A roofie? I'd never.

487
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,916
We had a great time
together.

488
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,084
You were happy.

489
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,235
Oh, yeah.
I'm thrilled.

490
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:05,871
I have to go.

491
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,290
You know your pal guy is the one
icing all those people, right?

492
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:10,676
No, he's not.

493
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,127
Oh, so he's not a witch?

494
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,546
No.

495
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,515
He's just a wiccan.

496
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,383
Wiccans are good,
like Glinda of Oz.

497
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,468
You're not this stupid,
Becky.

498
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,254
Whatever
is killing people...

499
00:25:23,306 --> 00:25:24,523
It's something else.

500
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,024
It's <i>never</i>
<i>something else.</i>

501
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:29,144
When are there ever two crazy
things in town at the same time?

502
00:25:29,212 --> 00:25:32,114
Guy's the creep,
and you're on his list.

503
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,950
No. He's my friend.

504
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,085
No, he's your <i>dealer.</i>

505
00:25:37,153 --> 00:25:38,487
Look, I don't know

506
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,655
how much he's charging you
for that Spanish fly --

507
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,908
Nothing!
He <i>gives</i> it to me.

508
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,160
And he said
it wouldn't even work

509
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,412
unless you already loved me,
deep down.

510
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,630
It just activates it.

511
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:51,133
So you think I love you?

512
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,252
Deep, <i>deep</i> down?

513
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,804
Then untie me.

514
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:02,260
No. No!

515
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,396
You're still working
through your emotions.

516
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,015
I love you, too!

517
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,073
On the table,
next to the nametags.

518
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,877
Guy.

519
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,697
Why don't you
take a seat?

520
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,035
Tough day?

521
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,088
Okay.

522
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:32,174
We can cut right to it
if you like.

523
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:37,963
Ah.

524
00:26:39,715 --> 00:26:41,183
Let's talk price.

525
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,884
What?

526
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:44,486
Well, we're a little past
the freebie stage,

527
00:26:44,554 --> 00:26:45,537
don't you think?

528
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,524
But I thought
we were besties.

529
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:52,811
Ohh, honey.

530
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:55,781
That is so depressingly
"Becky."

531
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:58,016
I mean, it's --
you're so pathetic,

532
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:00,952
it actually loops back
around again to cute.

533
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,156
Okay.
You want me to pay, fine.

534
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:06,074
Do you accept
personal checks?

535
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:07,409
No.

536
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:10,045
But I will take
your soul.

537
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,031
You're a crossroads demon.

538
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,365
Bingo, bango!

539
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,340
I love reunions.

540
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,009
The desperation!

541
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,877
These schlubs will sign
on the dotted line

542
00:27:25,928 --> 00:27:29,481
for money, power, hair --

543
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:31,183
whatever it takes
to impress

544
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,935
the nostalgically bangable
head cheerleader.

545
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,055
Sam was right.

546
00:27:37,106 --> 00:27:39,107
<i>You</i> killed those people.

547
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:40,391
But for legal reasons,

548
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:42,393
let's just say they had...

549
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:44,863
unfortunate accidents.

550
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,700
So, what,
I hand over my soul,

551
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,568
and the next day
a piano falls on my head?

552
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,754
No, I'd never
do that to you.

553
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,673
I promise.

554
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,924
I'm not stupid.

555
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,459
But you <i>are</i> special.

556
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,344
I am?

557
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,579
Hey.

558
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:04,249
I wasn't thrilled
to see your new hubby

559
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,251
was Sam freakin'
Winchester.

560
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:07,769
I mean, if he knew

561
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,304
that I was here talking to you,
I mean, he'd probably --

562
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,388
Gank your ass.

563
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,973
Yes!

564
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,792
And I'm very protective
of my ass.

565
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,778
It's one
of my best features.

566
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:23,785
Becky, I'm prepared to offer you
a one-time-only deal.

567
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,253
Not 10 years.

568
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:26,821
25.

569
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,792
No pianos, guaranteed.

570
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:31,993
Just Sam.

571
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:35,113
For my soul.

572
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:37,299
And your promise to not breathe
a word about this

573
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,800
to the Winchesters,

574
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,302
and I'll be
on my merry way.

575
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:44,422
No one gets a deal
like this, Becky.

576
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,092
Not Kings, not Popes.

577
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,476
I snap my fingers,

578
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,645
and Sam will love you
for the rest of your life.

579
00:28:57,687 --> 00:28:59,487
I think I'll have
that drink now.

580
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,968
Anything?

581
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:33,671
Uh, she's got
11 Twitter...Ers.

582
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:38,026
Last post --

583
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,511
"Going on romantic trip
with hubster!!!"

584
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:41,947
Three exclamation points.

585
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:45,450
I guess
she got excited.

586
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,819
That look romantic
to you?

587
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,571
Oh, hell, no.

588
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,573
But I got this thing
about fish.

589
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,408
Dead eyes, man.

590
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:03,368
Huh.

591
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,803
Well...

592
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:24,773
This is not how I imagined
spending my reunion.

593
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,943
I was gonna show you off --

594
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:31,613
not that anyone actually knows
who you are.

595
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:35,750
"Supernatural" is not
exactly popular, but...

596
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,068
You're tall...

597
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,255
and nice and...

598
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,041
...they'd all think
I was happy.

599
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:48,797
You're mad. I get it.

600
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,515
But...

601
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,887
Can we talk?

602
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,756
I know
you don't love me.

603
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:01,326
I know what I am, okay?

604
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,313
I'm a loser.

605
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:07,232
In school, in life.

606
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,402
Guess that's why
I like <i>you</i> so much.

607
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:11,703
What?!

608
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,604
I mean,
not that you're a loser,

609
00:31:13,656 --> 00:31:15,657
but you had that whole
character arc

610
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,826
about being a freak,
and...

611
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,494
I can relate.

612
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,498
Honestly...

613
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,417
The only place
people understood me

614
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:26,835
was the message boards.

615
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,221
They were grumpy
and overly literal,

616
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:34,225
but at least we shared
a common passion.

617
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,227
And I'll take it,
you know?

618
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,146
Then I met you guys --

619
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,850
the real Sam and Dean.

620
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,601
And I started
dating Chuck.

621
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,855
And everything was...

622
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,357
Amazing.

623
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,830
But you left,

624
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:58,983
and Chuck dumped me.

625
00:31:59,034 --> 00:32:01,652
I think I intimidated him
with my vibrant sexuality.

626
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,789
I just want someone
who loves me for me!

627
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,990
Is that too much to ask?

628
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,429
What?

629
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,768
If you want somebody
to love you for you,

630
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,219
maybe don't drug them.

631
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:20,671
But I want you!

632
00:32:20,723 --> 00:32:23,558
And this is the only way!

633
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:24,559
Becky.

634
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,180
Becky,
you're better than this.

635
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,067
That's sweet, but...

636
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:35,203
I'm not so sure.

637
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:43,694
Becks!

638
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:45,246
You missed the party.

639
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:47,966
Yeah. Well...

640
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,200
Weird night.

641
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:51,920
So, what are we thinking?

642
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:56,224
Okay.

643
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,311
I'm in.

644
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:12,625
You're making
the right choice.

645
00:33:12,692 --> 00:33:14,577
I know.

646
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:18,530
So...

647
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:20,115
We seal the deal
with a kiss?

648
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:21,767
Exactly.

649
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:22,835
Pucker up,
sweetheart.

650
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:28,674
I'm not
your sweetheart!

651
00:33:31,478 --> 00:33:33,095
Blueberry vodka.

652
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,347
The answer to all
of life's problems.

653
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:36,765
You see that, Sam?!

654
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,484
I did it
<i>just</i> like we said!

655
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:40,769
I am awesome! I --

656
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:43,055
I'll be over here.

657
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,907
Dean Winchester.

658
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:46,408
This is really thrilling.

659
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:47,660
Hey, can I have
your autograph?

660
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,413
Sure.

661
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:54,233
Yeah, I'll, uh, carve it
into your spleen.

662
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:56,835
So, how you running
your little scam?

663
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:00,923
Well,
how do you mean, Dean?

664
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:04,093
Signing 10-year deals,
snuffing 'em that week.

665
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,511
Well, I would never.
No.

666
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:06,845
Rules of the road --

667
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:08,297
can't lay a hair
on any of my clients.

668
00:34:08,365 --> 00:34:10,082
Right.
So how you cheating it?

669
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,918
I'm not a cheater.
I'm an innovator.

670
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:17,189
It's called a loophole,
you moron.

671
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:20,976
Yes, when a person
bargains away his soul,

672
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:24,163
he gets a decade,
technically.

673
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,264
But accidents happen.

674
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,485
So you're arranging "accidents"
and collecting early?

675
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:31,937
Oh, please.
White gloves.

676
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:33,956
I don't get my hands dirty.

677
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,459
That's why it's important
to have a capable intern.

678
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,005
What time did I ask you
to be here?!

679
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,269
<i>Exorcizamus te,</i>
<i>omnis --</i>

680
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,574
Becky...Run!

681
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,130
Whoa.

682
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:46,011
How many deals you got cooking
in this town, Madoff?

683
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:47,563
15.

684
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,315
Yeah, well,
call them off,

685
00:35:49,366 --> 00:35:52,234
or I'll cut my own loophole
in your throat.

686
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,569
Oh, crap.

687
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,988
Yeah, you said it.
You're in a world --

688
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,873
Hello, boys.

689
00:35:57,957 --> 00:35:59,708
Oh, crap.

690
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:06,799
Sam, mazel tov.
Who's the lucky lady?

691
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:08,917
You're Crowley!

692
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,337
And you're --

693
00:36:11,388 --> 00:36:14,757
well, I'm sure you have
a wonderful personality, dear.

694
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:16,225
Ah, another step,

695
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:18,644
and I'll Colombian necktie
your little friend here.

696
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:21,146
Please, don't let him
get off that easy.

697
00:36:21,214 --> 00:36:23,548
Sir, I don't think
that you --

698
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,819
I know exactly
what you've been doing.

699
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:30,239
A little birdie named Jackson
sold you out,

700
00:36:30,323 --> 00:36:32,858
e-mailed all the juicy deets
to my suggestion box.

701
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:36,662
I assume...

702
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:38,747
That's my whistle-blower?

703
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:44,370
Shame. Had a future.

704
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,256
Unfortunately, you <i>don't.</i>

705
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,508
I was just --
there's only one rule --

706
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:52,428
make a deal, keep it.

707
00:36:52,512 --> 00:36:54,413
Well, technically,
I didn't --

708
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,265
there's a reason we don't
call our chits in early --

709
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:57,749
consumer confidence.

710
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,252
This isn't Wall Street!
This is hell!

711
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:02,554
We have a little something
called integrity.

712
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:04,390
This gets out,
who'll deal with us? Nobody!

713
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:05,590
Then where are we?!

714
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,110
I don't know.

715
00:37:08,194 --> 00:37:10,045
That's right. You don't.

716
00:37:10,113 --> 00:37:12,781
Because you're a stupid,
shortsighted little prat.

717
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:14,983
Now, hand
the jackass over.

718
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,535
I'll cancel
every deal he's made.

719
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:17,986
What are you gonna do
with him?

720
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,271
Make an example of him.

721
00:37:23,293 --> 00:37:25,294
Fair trade, right?

722
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:27,379
We all go
our separate ways.

723
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:28,613
No harm done.

724
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:30,466
What, out of the goodness
of your heart?

725
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:32,885
Years of demons
nipping at your heels,

726
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:34,453
haven't seen one for months.
Wonder why?

727
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:36,472
We've been
a little busy.

728
00:37:36,556 --> 00:37:38,757
Hunting Leviathan --
yes, I know.

729
00:37:38,808 --> 00:37:42,594
That's why I told my lads
to stay clear of you meatheads.

730
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:47,866
So, what do you know
about --

731
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:50,569
too much.
You met that dick yet?

732
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:53,605
Smuggest tub of goo
since Mussolini.

733
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:55,941
I hate the bastards.

734
00:37:55,992 --> 00:37:57,826
Squash 'em all, please.

735
00:37:57,911 --> 00:37:58,911
I'll stay clear.

736
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,164
Rip up the contracts
first.

737
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,700
Done...And done.

738
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:08,420
Your turn.

739
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:10,622
No, no, no, no.
Let --

740
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:17,062
Pleasure, gentlemen.

741
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:23,685
What'd I miss?

742
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:37,800
It...

743
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:40,686
It wasn't <i>all</i> bad,
right?

744
00:38:43,773 --> 00:38:46,709
Okay,
y-you did save my life,

745
00:38:46,776 --> 00:38:49,111
and for that, thanks.

746
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:51,513
So, I'll see you again?

747
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:55,868
Yeah, probably not.

748
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:12,084
Becky, look.

749
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:14,369
You're <i>not</i> a loser, okay?

750
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:17,389
You're a good person,
a-and you've got...

751
00:39:17,474 --> 00:39:21,376
A lot of...

752
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:22,845
E-energy.

753
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:26,365
So, you know, just do your
thing, whatever that is,

754
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:29,151
and the right guy
will find you.

755
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,014
No.

756
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:44,083
No.

757
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:51,924
Well, buddy,
I got to say, man --

758
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:54,460
you, uh...
You don't suck.

759
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:56,345
Thank you.

760
00:39:56,412 --> 00:39:59,348
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

761
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:04,053
Well...

762
00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:08,107
Ohh.

763
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:11,443
Yeah.
All right, that's --

764
00:40:11,528 --> 00:40:13,095
thank you.

765
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:19,818
Take care.

766
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:23,438
- Aw, you made a friend.
- Unh-unh.

767
00:40:29,946 --> 00:40:31,413
Look, man, uh...

768
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:35,284
...When I was all dosed up,
I-I said some crap.

769
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:38,087
Oh, you mean, she --
she <i>wasn't</i> your soul mate?

770
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:39,471
Shut up.

771
00:40:39,556 --> 00:40:42,007
I mean, I <i>do</i> need you
watching my back.

772
00:40:42,092 --> 00:40:43,225
Obviously.

773
00:40:43,293 --> 00:40:46,128
Yeah, when, uh,
crazy groupies attack.

774
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:47,179
You know what I mean.

775
00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:49,682
You know,
I got to say, man...

776
00:40:49,766 --> 00:40:52,434
For a wackjob,
you really pulled it together.

777
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:55,154
That's the nicest thing
anyone's said to me.

778
00:40:55,238 --> 00:40:58,307
Look,
don't be too impressed, man.

779
00:40:58,358 --> 00:40:59,908
It's still a Denver scramble
up here.

780
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:01,643
I just know my way
around the plate now.

781
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:05,114
I'm just saying.

782
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:08,250
It's stupid to think that you
need me around all the time.

783
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:10,152
You're a grown-up.

784
00:41:10,203 --> 00:41:11,754
Right.

785
00:41:12,822 --> 00:41:15,457
You're a hike-in-the-desert,
hippie-douche grown-up.

786
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:17,960
Dude, I was camping.
<i>You</i> camp.

787
00:41:18,011 --> 00:41:20,296
Yeah, whatever.
Hippie.

788
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:22,164
You know what, though?
Seriously?

789
00:41:22,215 --> 00:41:24,350
- It might be nice.
- What?

790
00:41:24,434 --> 00:41:26,702
I mean, you basically
have been looking out for me

791
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:27,970
your whole life.

792
00:41:28,021 --> 00:41:31,640
Now you finally get to take care
of yourself.

793
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:33,192
About time, huh?

794
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:35,728
Yeah.

795
00:41:35,812 --> 00:41:37,012
Right.

796
