1
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:04,146
There's a new leader.
arising in the West.

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:05,615
Hi Dean.

3
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:07,124
It's me, Lilith.

4
00:00:07,126 --> 00:00:08,961
I don't think
I like you anymore.

5
00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:11,830
Aah!

6
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:16,034
I'm gonna put up a barrier
inside your mind.

7
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:18,036
Don't scratch the wall.

8
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:20,939
Maybe I'm not real,
but I'm not going anywhere, Sam.

9
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,842
Sam! Unh!

10
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:25,844
Aren't you full up
just playing snuffleupagus

11
00:00:25,945 --> 00:00:28,046
with the devil
all the livelong?

12
00:00:28,147 --> 00:00:29,781
I don't know, Bobby.
Seeing Lucifer's fine with me.

13
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:33,785
At least all my crazy's
under one umbrella.

14
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,709
Ms. Havelock,
you shouldn't have come.

15
00:01:02,382 --> 00:01:04,182
I needed to see it
for myself --

16
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:06,785
after all that tracking,
all those hours we spent.

17
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:10,489
I mean, it's one thing to
study them in books. It's...

18
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:28,123
Do I smell menopause?

19
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:32,844
Well, if it isn't
the Wiccan bitch of the west.

20
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:37,716
Ms. Havelock, I know you're the
one that helped them find me.

21
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:41,353
My God...

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,223
Not in time
to save our big girl here,

23
00:01:44,274 --> 00:01:46,591
but still,
you get a merit badge.

24
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:52,314
They caught you,
you son of a bitch!

25
00:01:52,398 --> 00:01:53,732
No more murders!

26
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:56,068
And you're going back
to hell.

27
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,371
Oh, Nora, Nora...

28
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,941
I'm gonna scoop you out
like a pumpkin.

29
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:04,442
You know that?

30
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,257
Yeah, your, uh,
scooping days are over, Gomer.

31
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:20,259
All you got to worry about
now...

32
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,343
Is us.

33
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:29,634
You ain't the first demon we've
tracked down on this safari.

34
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:31,520
That's right.

35
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:34,139
As a matter of fact, I think
you put us over half a dozen.

36
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,325
Looking for Lilith
in all the wrong places.

37
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:38,860
Well, you're gonna help us
with that.

38
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:41,196
If things
are about to get messy,

39
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:45,684
maybe you should meet the owner
of this fleshy temple...

40
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:47,803
A puppy of a man.

41
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,821
You'll like him.

42
00:02:57,297 --> 00:02:59,097
Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, is that you?

43
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,387
No.

44
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,440
You have to stop him.

45
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:10,275
We will.
We're going to, okay?

46
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:12,510
We're gonna send that Demon
back to hell.

47
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:15,197
Okay.

48
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:16,848
Please don't hurt me.

49
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:21,686
Jeffrey,
before we can let him go...

50
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:26,625
Look, the Demon knows where we
can find more of his kind, okay?

51
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:32,164
See, we're hunting them --
all of them.

52
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:35,000
He's not gonna give up
his rolodex easy.

53
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,886
Jeffrey, we're gonna have to
cut in to him.

54
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:42,874
That means you.

55
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:55,487
Oh, the things he made me do
to those women.

56
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,025
Whatever you have to do...

57
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:03,561
You have to do it.

58
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:07,399
Please
just stop this evil piece of...

59
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:14,339
And on and on and on.

60
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,792
Frankly, he can get tedious

61
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:20,212
with this whole
"good and evil" thing.

62
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:23,265
You know,
you were right.

63
00:04:23,383 --> 00:04:25,934
I like Jeffrey.
He's a decent guy.

64
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:29,304
In fact, he just signed off
on his temple.

65
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:33,442
Uh...

66
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:37,396
Ohh!

67
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:46,738
Ohh!

68
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:47,939
Ohh!

69
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,776
Unh!

70
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:54,546
She's got other lieutenants.
We already know that.

71
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:55,630
We want names.

72
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:57,999
Unh! Ohh!

73
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,459
All right! All right!

74
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,012
His name is Merrick!

75
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:13,465
I swear!

76
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:15,967
You'll find him
in New Orleans!

77
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:19,738

00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:40,275
Jeffrey?

82
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,594
Jeffrey, you awake?

83
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:46,448
Hey, you passed out.
You're in shock.

84
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:48,116
He's -- he's gone?

85
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:50,318
We exorcised him.

86
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:53,405
Try not to move, okay?
We're almost to the hospital.

87
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:58,777
Your...
Your brother?

88
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:01,079
My brother stayed back to clean
us out of that crime scene.

89
00:06:01,113 --> 00:06:02,998
There's no reason to go down
for a Demon's murders.

90
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:04,883
You know what I mean?

91
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:16,394
All right.
All right, take it easy.

92
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:20,298
All right, you're good
to make it from here, right?

93
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:23,935
Okay, Jeffrey, no demon talk
in the E.R., you understand me?

94
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:24,936
You were mugged.

95
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,907
Okay.

96
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:32,027
Uh, um, uh, thank you.

97
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:54,933
"Classified server"?

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,501
Got to be Devereaux,
right?

99
00:06:58,003 --> 00:07:00,138
Hello?

100
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,306
Thank God.

101
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:03,341
Frank, Frank,
what do you got for me?

102
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:05,560
It's nice.

103
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:08,814
Kind of like a men's room
with beds.

104
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:14,286
Hmm, avocado grime.

105
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:20,024
Takes years to build up
a patina like this.

106
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:24,079
What do you mean
you can't find him?

107
00:07:24,163 --> 00:07:25,831
It's Dick Roman.
Turn on CNN.

108
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:28,867
Didn't you see him at that, uh,
press conference in Phoenix?

109
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:30,218
The bastard's everywhere.

110
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:35,807
You sure?

111
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,559
No, I-I-I don't.

112
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:39,728
I don't care
that they've infiltrated

113
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:42,397
the luxury-boat industry,
Frank.

114
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:44,232
Great. Call Kanye.

115
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,985
Frank's still stumped
on Roman?

116
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,236
Yeah.

117
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:50,188
All right,
let's do this.

118
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:52,223
Okay, um,
look at the victim profiles --

119
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:55,911
same age, same hair color,
body type.

120
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:57,996
The ritual mutilations
line up exactly.

121
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:01,199
Who down there would've
let our demon out of the can?

122
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,169
He squealed on his superiors.
We made sure of that.

123
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:07,372
I mean, he should be down under
until, uh, trumpet day.

124
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,074
But two women killed in the last
two weeks, same parts missing,

125
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:11,910
I mean,
same old hunting grounds, even.

126
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:13,912
All right, well,
we can take a swing at it.

127
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:16,348
But you know it's all about
the Leviathans now, okay?

128
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:18,016
They're the ones
we need to be hunting.

129
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:22,187
Yeah, but, no --
I mean, not right now.

130
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:24,973
This one's ours, Dean.

131
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:26,524
It's unfinished business,
apparently.

132
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:29,611
All right.

133
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:33,531
<i>- This is unit 32.</i> 
<i>- Repeat, we've got another one.</i>

134
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,950
<i>That's a 187.</i>

135
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:38,937

137
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,376
<i>Got a real mess here,</i>
<i>dispatch.</i>

138
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:56,972
You know, every time we do this,
I wonder if today's the day.

139
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:58,924
We walk up, flash our tin
to a bunch of chompers

140
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:00,625
pretending to be policemen.

141
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:02,126
I hear you.

142
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:04,346
Thought you guys
might show up.

143
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,800
It's the drummer boys,
agents, uh, Bonham...

144
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:10,435
and Watts, right?

145
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:11,319
Yeah.

146
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:12,988
Yeah, absolutely.

147
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:16,107
Uh, it's a pleasure to see you
again, Detective...

148
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:17,976
- Sutton.
- You know what? Pardon me.

149
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:20,228
Uh, what was it --
Detective...

150
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:21,446
Sutton.

151
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:23,615
Oh, no problemo --
Detective Sutton.

152
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,449
Sutton.

153
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,784
Sutton, yeah. Hi.

154
00:09:27,753 --> 00:09:30,088
Sad to say,
case looks to be open again.

155
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:32,340
Are you sure?

156
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:34,509
Same tools.

157
00:09:34,593 --> 00:09:37,662
Same cuts.
Same crazy.

158
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:41,182
Makes sense.

159
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:44,619
I mean, we didn't catch the
critter last time, did we?

160
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:45,920
And no suspects?

161
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:47,171
Same as before.

162
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:48,890
Very thorough.

163
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,175
Cold-blooded.

164
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,564
Thank you, Detective.

165
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:57,699
Anytime.

166
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,957
Hey.

167
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:10,862
Sulfur.

168
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:11,863
Damn it.

169
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:14,666
Better go check
on Havelock.

170
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:16,701
This is it.

171
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:23,141

173
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:29,347
White magic only
herbs and talismans.

174
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:36,571
You sure about that?

175
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:38,690
Careful, it's still drying.

176
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:41,576
I have a friend
at the sheriff's office.

177
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,162
I know about
all the new murders.

178
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:47,749
I'm doing what I can
to protect myself.

179
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:53,038
I'm also translating
some very old banishments.

180
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,096
Wow, uh, these are --
these are good.

181
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,681
Thanks.
Got an affinity.

182
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:06,468
But back then,
that night in that farmhouse,

183
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:08,053
I was in over my head.

184
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:10,388
I know that now, believe me. I
will leave all that to the pros.

185
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,323
Well,
you helped track it down.

186
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:14,359
I mean,
it was some solid legwork.

187
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,260
When it came down to it,
all I really knew

188
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:17,762
was somebody
who knew somebody

189
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:19,364
who knew the right number
to call.

190
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:21,149
And your number is not working,
by the way.

191
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:22,784
Right, we, uh, we've had

192
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:25,770
some  technical
difficulties -- phone issues.

193
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:26,938
It's a monster problem,
really.

194
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:31,960
So, uh, you haven't
had any contact?

195
00:11:32,044 --> 00:11:34,162
With the Demon?
No, thank God.

196
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:36,998
I have one or two things
to finish in town,

197
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,449
and then I'm leaving.

198
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:40,001
Good choice.

199
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:43,054
Have you found
Jeffrey yet?

200
00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:44,305
Who?

201
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,308
The man
who the demon possessed.

202
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:49,811
The one
you almost beat to death.

203
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:52,230
Yeah, Jeffrey.

204
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:54,298
That poor bastard.

205
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,735
Some demons tend to be
sentimental, don't they?

206
00:11:57,803 --> 00:12:00,905
Always go back to the same host
if they can.

207
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:02,306
It's a start.

208
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:06,077
I want to talk about Cinemax.

209
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:07,745
We're grown men.

210
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:11,149
We pay rent.
Why can't we get Cinemax?

211
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,201
Skinemax.

212
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:15,620
The halfway program advisers
have already weighed in on that.

213
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:17,122
Fine, fine.

214
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:20,008
- Bringing it up in group is not gon--
- I said fine!

215
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:21,926
Jeffrey,

216
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:25,096
you have something pretty big
going down later this morning.

217
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:29,467
That's right, I guess.
Um, I'm picking her up today.

218
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:32,336
I'm getting a dog --
a rescue.

219
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:35,190
I had to get her spayed
and shots and stuff,

220
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:38,143
but they said she's ready.

221
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:40,061
Jeffrey and I talked about this.

222
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:42,814
He understands that
pet ownership is a privilege,

223
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:44,482
not a right.

224
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,401
He's gonna have to
show the whole house

225
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:48,236
that he can handle
the responsibility.

226
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,206
And that's what it's all about,
right, Alan?

227
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,957
Handling it.

228
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:57,412
You okay there?
Huh?

229
00:12:57,496 --> 00:12:59,914
Surgery's a bucket of laughs,
huh?

230
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:00,999
You look good.

231
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,367
I'm sorry for the cone of shame,

232
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:06,004
but we got to
keep these stitches in.

233
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,674
Okay. Okay.

234
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:12,310
Come on. Come on.

235
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:16,648
- Hey!

236
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:38,686
Oh!

237
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:45,103
Jeffrey?

238
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:46,354
Jeffrey?

239
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:49,157
Okay. Look, it's okay.
You're okay, you're okay.

240
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:50,474
Sorry.

241
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:52,193
Just had to make sure.

242
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:55,496
Make sure of what --
that I peed my pants today?

243
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,919
Aw, you scared my dog.

244
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:04,172
Uh, we did not want to
do that.

245
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:07,708
Listen, Jeff, we got to,
uh, we got to talk.

246
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:13,965
Well, this is, uh...

247
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:16,484
I know what it is.

248
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:21,422
Look, I know it must've been,
um, hard.

249
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,525
Do you even listen
to yourself?

250
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:30,565
Oh, don't bother.

251
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,483
What do you guys want from me?

252
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:37,138
Well, um, we're pretty sure
the demon that possessed you...

253
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:38,689
Is back.

254
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,158
What?

255
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:41,993
What do you mean?

256
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:45,746
You exorcised him, right?

257
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:50,635
He's -- he's supposed to be
in Hell.

258
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:52,970
Jeffrey, look,
please just calm down.

259
00:14:53,038 --> 00:14:54,555
Just have a seat, please.

260
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,924
I don't understand.

261
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:59,060
Three more women have been
murdered over the past two weeks.

262
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:00,711
No, no.

263
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:02,480
Same vic profiles,
same forensics,

264
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:04,482
crime scene
dusted with sulfur.

265
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:06,317
We've got to assume
that it's him.

266
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:07,902
But we're here now, okay?

267
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,270
So if he comes after you,

268
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:11,388
we'll nail him
just like we did last time.

269
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,274
What was her name?

270
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:14,158
What?

271
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:16,494
The last one he killed.

272
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,395
Uh, Anna?

273
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:19,764
Anna Paxton.

274
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:24,368
Marjorie Willis.
She's the next one on the list.

275
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:26,070
List? What list?

276
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,974
The demon used to recite it all
the time, like a grocery list.

277
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:31,843
He burned it in my head --

278
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,912
the names of all the women
he was gonna kill.

279
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:36,347
He already had
his victims chosen?

280
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:39,133
And put in a line
in an order.

281
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:40,751
Wait. Why?

282
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:43,554
Demons aren't usually into the
obsessive serial-killer crap.

283
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:46,023
You know, they're more
just kind of all-around evil.

284
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:47,424
Why would he do this?

285
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:50,945
He said it was his job.

286
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:03,324
Jeffrey, did your,
uh, guests sign in?

287
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,326
I'm really sorry, Alan.

288
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,329
They're friends of mine from
my days back at the Post Office.

289
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:09,947
I didn't know
they were coming.

290
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:11,499
So, what do you think?

291
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,886
I think we really helped mess
this poor son of a bitch up.

292
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:18,222
Look at him.
He's got a state-assigned dad.

293
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,508
Okay, just get them to sign in
when they sign out.

294
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:28,900
Uh, Jeffrey,
look, I'm gonna go,

295
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,485
uh, I'm gonna go find Marjorie
Willis, keep her on watch, okay?

296
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,154
Don't worry.

297
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:35,639
I'm gonna stay here
just in case.

298
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:57,678
You're right.
We just don't read anymore.

299
00:16:57,763 --> 00:17:00,664
Marjorie Willis.

300
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:03,434
Librarian,
indoor gardening enthusiast,

301
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:06,854
our Demon's
next organ donor.

302
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:32,079
Come on, Sam, talk to me.
It's been months.

303
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:44,091
When you left me at the E.R.,
I had three smashed fingers,

304
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:49,513
five teeth out, a broken wrist,
nose, cheekbone, collarbone.

305
00:17:49,564 --> 00:17:51,599
I had to get 160 stitches.

306
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:53,684
Mugged.

307
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:56,053
The doctor on duty
said it looked like

308
00:17:56,104 --> 00:17:58,489
I got caught
in the Spanish Inquisition.

309
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:00,024
And we're the good guys.

310
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:01,909
They patched me up, mostly.

311
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:06,614
But I lost my job,
my health insurance.

312
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:12,119
I just started to drink
and drift, and I got lost.

313
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:15,122
Had some kind of
mental break.

314
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:19,377
And I started to talk...
about what happened.

315
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:23,414
Aw, man. Never tell.
Never...Never.

316
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:27,268
I know that now,
believe me.

317
00:18:27,352 --> 00:18:28,769
So, let me guess.

318
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:33,224
Drunk tank to psych eval
to 72-hour forced hold

319
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:36,527
to a nice long stay at
an institution of their choice.

320
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:38,279
Yes.

321
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:41,465
It's happened
to friends of mine.

322
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:44,402
For a long time,
I didn't care.

323
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:47,655
The truth was more important
than where I was.

324
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:51,192
I was in no shape to cope
with the outside world.

325
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:53,610
Well, hey, you got out,
you know?

326
00:18:53,662 --> 00:18:55,129
Holding it together.

327
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:57,581
And now the demon is back.

328
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:58,782
Yeah.

329
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,218
I'm sorry, man.

330
00:19:01,286 --> 00:19:05,956
I mean it --
about all of it, you know?

331
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:07,925
You saved my life.

332
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:11,145
I owe you for it.
I know that.

333
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:14,682
I owe a lot of people
for getting even this far.

334
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:17,151
I...

335
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:20,938
Crap.

336
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:22,406
What?

337
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:26,494
If he isn't already circling
the next woman, Marjorie,

338
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:28,979
than I-I think I might know
where he is.

339
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,699
He had this special place

340
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:35,953
where he kept souvenirs
where he nested.

341
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:37,821
Why didn't you tell us this?

342
00:19:37,873 --> 00:19:39,156
I didn't want to go.

343
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:41,342
You don't have to go.
We'll handle it.

344
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:42,993
I do. I have to.

345
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:48,665
"Average annual rainfall --
Hackberry, Texas"...

346
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:26,703
Come on, Sam,
pay attention to me.

347
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:27,922
I'm bored.

348
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:39,233
Civil war buff?

349
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:51,612
Damn it -- no service.

350
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:56,617
Good girl. You stay.

351
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:58,252
Here's some jerky.

352
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:02,089
Stay.

353
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:05,742
Thing's not gonna pee in here,
is it?

354
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:08,179
Um, I don't know.

355
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:21,525
So, he'd get you this far, and then
he'd shut your lights out, yeah?

356
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:25,112
For some reason, he was very
secretive about this place.

357
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:26,530
But after a while,

358
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:30,201
he'd only really sort of cover
my eyes when we walked in.

359
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:32,269
Okay, you think
you can get us back there?

360
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:43,447
Right here in my
discontinued periodicals.

361
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:45,499
Oh.

362
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:48,419
Oh, that's it.

363
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:03,300
Red door
down the hallway.

364
00:22:05,103 --> 00:22:06,437
Yeah, there is.

365
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:28,992
This must be it.

366
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:46,110
All right, stay over here.
Okay?

367
00:22:46,177 --> 00:22:49,029
You just stay here.
Don't move.

368
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:06,630
What the hell?

369
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:30,187
Hey.

370
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:33,824
Hey.
Hey, all right.

371
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:36,276
We're gonna
get you out of here.

372
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:39,697
Hey, hey, I'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

373
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:42,333
But you got to stay still.

374
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:56,950
I'm pretty sure this guy's the
boring sort of chubby chaser.

375
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:04,741
<i>Leave your name, number,</i>
<i>and nightmare at the tone.</i>

376
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:07,577
Dean, where are you?
I'm scoping zero out here.

377
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:11,414
Not a good sign.

378
00:24:17,838 --> 00:24:19,121
Hmm.

379
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:22,125
Surprised you haven't
picked up on that yet.

380
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:27,680
It's right...
There in the coroner's report.

381
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:32,552
Yeah. Uh-huh.

382
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,638
In this latest round
of killings, our big girls

383
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:38,825
had traces of heavy
tranquilizers in their blood.

384
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,160
Yeah, but our Demon's
strong enough

385
00:24:41,228 --> 00:24:43,746
to make fat Betty
do whatever he wants to, right?

386
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:45,648
So, why does he need
the tranqs?

387
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:48,201
Think he's got a bad back?

388
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:51,504
Yeah,
whatever is going on here,

389
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:54,340
you know that Demon's
not coming back to kill anybody.

390
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,464
<i>This is Special Agent Smith.</i>

391
00:25:01,515 --> 00:25:03,800
<i>Please leave your name, number --</i>

392
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:05,735
Oh, no. That's every cellphone
Dean's got.

393
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:07,637
One of them should've picked up,
right?

394
00:25:07,688 --> 00:25:09,355
Big brother's probably dead.

395
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,224
Shut up.

396
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:21,134
He said "shut up" to me.

397
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,825
That's what I'm talking about,
Sam -- real interaction again.

398
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:30,493
I miss that.

399
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:33,079
The rapier wit,
the wittier rape.

400
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:36,249
Come on.

401
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,217
I'll be good.

402
00:25:38,302 --> 00:25:41,170
I'll even help you solve

403
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:43,256
your little Nancy Drew mystery
or whatever.

404
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:47,209
No note.

405
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:56,019
Hmm,
a cellphone scrambler.

406
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,387
But, Luci, those are illegal.
Think, Sam.

407
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:02,075
Maybe this has something to do
with Dean's telephone blackout.

408
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:37,477
Hmm.

409
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:40,146
Latin --
not suspicious at all.

410
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,732
I've never seen
this spell before.

411
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:45,935
No. But you've seen
this type.

412
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:49,155
Demon summoning -- why?

413
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:52,041
Why? To summon a demon,
jackass.

414
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:54,276
Start looking at who.

415
00:26:57,798 --> 00:26:59,882
Okay, what do you mean?

416
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,450
Look at the page.

417
00:27:05,472 --> 00:27:07,256
You know this handwriting.
I know this handwriting.

418
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:38,838
Ohh!

419
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:41,657
<i>Iay, caramba!</i>
<i>Imi cabeza!</i>

420
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:48,548
Nora, stop it!
Calm down!

421
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:51,100
What is this?
What is this?

422
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,336
Why did Jeffrey have a demon
summoning in your handwriting?

423
00:27:54,388 --> 00:27:57,140
Everything's happening the way
he said, the way he planned it.

424
00:27:57,191 --> 00:27:59,142
- What plan?!
- You can't help --

425
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:00,777
you can't change it.

426
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:02,728
Hit her.

427
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:05,731
Nora,
tell me what is going on.

428
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,618
Sam, shake her up.
She knows what happened to Dean.

429
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:10,820
Get this stupid cow to focus,
will you?

430
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:12,622
Nora, listen to me!

431
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:15,191
Whatever it is, you should be a
lot more scared of me right now

432
00:28:15,242 --> 00:28:17,376
because I'm 2 inches away from
you, and I can make you talk.

433
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:18,828
Do you understand me?

434
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:24,550
It's my son.

435
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,838
He has my son!

436
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:30,807
What were you thinking?

437
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:32,433
I mean, why would you even
help bring back a demon

438
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:33,658
in the first place?

439
00:28:33,927 --> 00:28:35,845
Not the demon.

440
00:28:35,896 --> 00:28:37,096
Jeffrey!

441
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:47,389
Jeffrey?

442
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:53,529
Good. You're up.

443
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,299
What happened?
What's going on?

444
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:58,501
No one asked you
to get involved,

445
00:28:58,568 --> 00:29:01,554
to save me,
to save anyone.

446
00:29:01,622 --> 00:29:02,922
What?

447
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:07,043
Did you ever think that maybe
I loved being possessed?

448
00:29:07,094 --> 00:29:08,211
Did you?

449
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:11,797
I loved the connection,
the power.

450
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:13,582
And I loved him.

451
00:29:13,634 --> 00:29:17,186
Love of my life, actually.

452
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:19,105
Oh, you got to be
kidding me.

453
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:20,306
He liberated me --

454
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,777
started me
on my true life mission.

455
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:26,979
So you're the one with the thing
for all those women.

456
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:28,648
Aren't you, Jeffrey?

457
00:29:30,617 --> 00:29:32,952
You're a serial killer.

458
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,171
I was nothing
before he found me --

459
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:39,742
a shadow too scared to do
what I was brought here to do.

460
00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:42,778
Too timid to live up
to my true potential.

461
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:45,882
So, what happened --

462
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:49,285
redheaded mommy make you
stuff birds, put on dresses?

463
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:52,088
You shouldn't trivialize
other people's pain.

464
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:56,259
So, demon comes along,
rides co-pilot in your skull...

465
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,478
Teaches you how to kill.

466
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:02,848
The list...
That's yours.

467
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:06,635
For years,
it was just a game I would play.

468
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:10,239
Every time I'd walk by
one of them in the street

469
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:13,593
or see one
on my mail route...

470
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,445
There's a sound
that comes from their brains.

471
00:30:16,496 --> 00:30:17,813
You know that?

472
00:30:17,864 --> 00:30:21,951
Only I can hear it, like
an evil, little steam whistle.

473
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,857
Every time I saw one,
I'd follow her,

474
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:30,843
take down her address.

475
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:35,615
But I was never
gonna do anything,

476
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:37,516
not till he came along.

477
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:41,487
He's the one who saved me.

478
00:30:41,555 --> 00:30:44,390
And you sent him to Hell.

479
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:47,693
I kept tabs on Jeffrey
after the exorcism.

480
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:49,979
I even sent him
care packages in the hospital,

481
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,647
but he never responded.

482
00:30:51,698 --> 00:30:53,515
And then not long ago,
he came to me.

483
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:57,153
He seemed healthy, put together,
except he wanted to know

484
00:30:57,204 --> 00:30:59,655
if there was a way
to summon the demon back.

485
00:30:59,706 --> 00:31:01,574
He said he'd been doing
some research.

486
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:04,543
It was mostly nonsense, but he
was convinced it was possible.

487
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:07,964
You really knocked the cork out
of her piehole.

488
00:31:08,031 --> 00:31:09,999
I sent him away.

489
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,301
I told him
to get some more help.

490
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:14,170
The next day

491
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:16,305
He called me.

492
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:20,643
He put my son on the phone.

493
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,230
He had taken him
from his dorm room.

494
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:27,483
I gave him everything --

495
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,237
the ritual, the sigils.

496
00:31:31,321 --> 00:31:32,855
But he kept my boy.

497
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,361
And then he sent me this.

498
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:47,920
My baby's ear.

499
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:50,406
He cut it off
because the ritual didn't work.

500
00:31:50,457 --> 00:31:51,740
Well...

501
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:54,176
That demon gave up
some serious state secrets --

502
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:56,178
would've gone
into big lockdown now.

503
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:58,097
Not so easy to bring him back up.

504
00:31:58,181 --> 00:31:59,432
Jeffrey didn't care.

505
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:01,851
He told me to find out
what went wrong or else.

506
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:05,354
Finally, I found
a summoning spell

507
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:07,973
that would work for sure.

508
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:15,648
And that's when he said
I had another job to do.

509
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:17,283
Which was what?

510
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:20,386
When you came, I was supposed to
send you to Jeffrey.

511
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:23,322
He left a trail of bodies
to make sure of it.

512
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:27,993
"Blood of the exorcist"?

513
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:30,079
Strongest summoning
I've ever seen.

514
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,082
Requires the blood of the
exorcist who banished him --

515
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:34,750
your brother.

516
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:36,752
You see?

517
00:32:36,803 --> 00:32:39,121
It is all part
of Jeffrey's plan.

518
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:43,059
Yeah. Well...New plan.

519
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:45,010
Tracking spell --
Bavarian, Egyptian.

520
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:46,846
I don't care --
dealer's choice.

521
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:50,900
Use the flesh of the body
to find the body and Dean.

522
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:54,520
Do you want the ear
or the kid?

523
00:32:54,588 --> 00:32:57,273
You're giving me the chills.

524
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:06,832
I like to think
I know you pretty well.

525
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:08,467
Yeah, how do you figure?

526
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:12,955
I watched you torture an
innocent man to get out a demon.

527
00:33:13,006 --> 00:33:17,993
Pretty charged situation...
Revealing.

528
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:24,066
You guys talked about a lot,
showed a lot of character.

529
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:25,968
God...

530
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:30,973
You were so desperate
to fix the world back then.

531
00:33:31,024 --> 00:33:33,192
It kills you...

532
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:37,346
That people
keep getting hurt...

533
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:40,616
And you just can't stop it.

534
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:45,854
Or I should say it's killed you,
shouldn't I?

535
00:33:47,374 --> 00:33:49,241
You know what?
Screw you.

536
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:53,362
- Hey.
- I was there.

537
00:33:53,413 --> 00:34:00,486
I was depressed, Dean,
because he was gone.

538
00:34:00,554 --> 00:34:05,391
I was a wreck,
an emotional shell, a drunk.

539
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,727
I was suicidal.

540
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:12,714
I don't usually endorse suicide,
but, man, what stopped you?

541
00:34:12,766 --> 00:34:16,101
It was Alan --
at the house.

542
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:17,770
You're kidding me.

543
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:21,106
He's a really good
rehab therapist.

544
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:25,444
Really helped me focus
on my goals, my attitude.

545
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:26,946
I have to say,

546
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,732
I really benefited
from the whole program.

547
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,750
Yeah.

548
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:34,003
A life well-lived

549
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:39,074
comes from the structured
pursuit of meaningful happiness.

550
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:43,679
I realized I was nothing
without my demon.

551
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:46,799
Then I decided
I have to get him back.

552
00:34:50,103 --> 00:34:52,388
I'll be right back.

553
00:34:57,927 --> 00:35:01,096
Hey, there, honey.
Come on.

554
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:07,403
It's a bitch of a recipe,
I must admit.

555
00:35:07,454 --> 00:35:09,071
No.

556
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:12,441
Oh,
you sick son of a bitch.

557
00:36:23,396 --> 00:36:25,264
Hello, Jeffrey.

558
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,405
Dean Winchester.

559
00:36:38,473 --> 00:36:42,426
As I live and breathe...

560
00:36:42,477 --> 00:36:44,261
Again.

561
00:36:44,312 --> 00:36:48,015
Oh! Oh! Oh!

562
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,351
What are you doing?

563
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:52,436
I'm thanking you,
Jeffrey.

564
00:36:56,491 --> 00:37:00,694
What are you doing with
this half-dead piece of crap?

565
00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:03,030
Come into me.

566
00:37:03,115 --> 00:37:05,699
We had a very special time
together, didn't we, Jeffrey?

567
00:37:05,784 --> 00:37:08,536
It warms my heart to see you
haven't forgotten what I taught you.

568
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,205
You built on it.

569
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:14,875
You captured a Winchester.

570
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,179
You, Jeffrey...My pupil.

571
00:37:18,263 --> 00:37:22,516
I don't want to be your pupil.
I want to be yours.

572
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:24,969
But I'm done with you.

573
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,188
My work is finished.

574
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:32,860
You can do everything now,
all on your beautiful own.

575
00:37:32,944 --> 00:37:34,145
No.

576
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:35,112
No?

577
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:37,848
Oh!

578
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:38,899
Unh!

579
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,123
We don't do "no."
Remember, Jeffrey?

580
00:37:48,577 --> 00:37:52,129
Keep sawing away at your ropes,
Penelope Pitstop.

581
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:55,049
We can dance standing up
if you want.

582
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:56,634
So,
is this what you do --

583
00:37:56,701 --> 00:38:00,421
find postal workers,
make 'em go postal?

584
00:38:00,505 --> 00:38:02,840
I talent scout.
That's all.

585
00:38:02,891 --> 00:38:06,727
Looking for the next generation
of superstars...

586
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:10,064
Before they get to hell,
like Jeffrey here.

587
00:38:12,383 --> 00:38:17,488
He had all the raw material...
Just bubbling in there.

588
00:38:17,555 --> 00:38:21,275
All I had to do
was loosen the lid on his jar,

589
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,194
show him
some practical know-how.

590
00:38:23,245 --> 00:38:24,745
Yeah, what about the kid?

591
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:26,780
This one?

592
00:38:26,865 --> 00:38:30,334
I don't think.

593
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:33,587
Not much to work with.

594
00:38:33,672 --> 00:38:36,173
No natural gift.

595
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:39,677
I'll probably burn this meat off
on my way to Vegas.

596
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:01,398
You've got to be kidding me!

597
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:05,653
You let go of my son!

598
00:39:05,737 --> 00:39:07,905
Where do you keep coming from?

599
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:22,386
<i>Exorcizamus te,</i>
<i>omnis immundus spiritus.</i>

600
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:25,556
He'll be back, you know.
Back in black.

601
00:39:25,623 --> 00:39:27,224
Go to hell.

602
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:29,760
<i>Omnis congregatio</i>
<i>et secta diabolica, ergo,</i>

603
00:39:29,811 --> 00:39:32,313
<i>Draco maledicte,</i>
<i>ecclesiam tuam,</i>

604
00:39:32,397 --> 00:39:37,651
<i>secura tibi facias libertate</i>
<i>servire, te rogamus, audi nos!</i>

605
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:45,475
Oh!

606
00:39:48,313 --> 00:39:51,332
Mom?

607
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:53,784
I got you.

608
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:57,487
I got you, baby.

609
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,211
Oh, God.

610
00:40:13,331 --> 00:40:17,451
So, Jeffrey was just pretending
to be the victim.

611
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:19,953
Way back in that farmhouse
during the exorcism,

612
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:23,507
h-he was just...acting.

613
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:26,427
He was a psychopath,
Sam.

614
00:40:26,478 --> 00:40:30,347
That's what they do
all the time, is act.

615
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:32,799
Act like they're normal,

616
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:37,137
act like they're not
balls-to-the-wall crazy.

617
00:40:37,205 --> 00:40:38,639
You going to sleep?

618
00:40:38,707 --> 00:40:41,275
Damn straight. Screw consciousness --
that's what I say.

619
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,583
No, no, Sam.
No nap for you, Sammy.

620
00:40:52,003 --> 00:40:55,589
Oh, come on,
don't do that.

621
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:58,041
Let's talk, Sam.

622
00:40:58,126 --> 00:41:00,544
I always enjoyed
our special little chats.

623
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:02,829
Don't you want to talk?

624
00:41:02,881 --> 00:41:04,665
Yeah, look at that.

625
00:41:04,733 --> 00:41:07,267
Something's definitely different
now, isn't it?

626
00:41:09,053 --> 00:41:11,221
You let me in.

627
00:41:11,306 --> 00:41:14,858
You wanted me, partner.

628
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:16,843
So you think you can use
your little tricks

629
00:41:16,895 --> 00:41:19,313
to banish me again
like that? No.

630
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:22,149
I do believe I've got you,
bunk buddy.

631
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,285
Got my finger wiggling around
in your brainpan.

632
00:41:34,746 --> 00:41:37,047
Come on, Sammy!
Come on!

633
00:41:37,132 --> 00:41:38,832
Say it with me now.

634
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:44,421
Good morning, Vietnam!

635
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:52,955
