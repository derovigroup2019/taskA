1
00:00:02,497 --> 00:00:03,696
I hate what...

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:05,606
oh, spewing the
bodily fluids everywhere.

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,797
It creepy, you know
it's downright unsanitary.

4
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:09,022
I-I can't hold them back!

5
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:10,281
- Hold who back?
- Leviathan!

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,980
They're like
shapeshifters only a lot

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:14,348
more into eating folk.
Nothing can kill 'em.

8
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,750
Yes, sir. Sam Winchester
was definitely here.

9
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:18,175
And I'll find out
where they went from here.

10
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:22,749
You know me. You know
the kind of person I am.

11
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,178
She's dropping bodies,
man,

12
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:26,624
Which means
we got to drop her.

13
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:28,941
She killed her own mom
to save <i>me.</i>

14
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:30,656
She's done.

15
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:33,061
You ever do something
behind someone's back

16
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:34,163
Because you had to?

17
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:36,181
You are what you are.

18
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:37,382
You will kill again.

19
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:39,101
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:51,679
Karen, don't second-guess
yourself.

21
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:53,365
Yes, your house is beautiful,

22
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:55,617
but didn't you tell me
a million times

23
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:57,402
that it's
Rick's dream house?

24
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:59,538
Selling it is how
you punish his ass, Karen,

25
00:00:59,622 --> 00:01:02,157
and after what you've been
through, don't you deserve that?

26
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,909
You do, honey.

27
00:01:03,993 --> 00:01:06,795
I'll have the papers ready
tomorrow.

28
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:09,331
Yay!
I'm proud of you.

29
00:01:09,382 --> 00:01:10,865
Bye.

30
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:12,751
I'm not good.

31
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:15,470
I'm <i>very</i> good.

32
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:18,306
There you are.

33
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:19,707
All right.

34
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:28,817
10 minutes.
Holler if you need anything.

35
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:56,678
Chris!

36
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:02,634
Ow.

37
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:03,751
Chri--

38
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:06,855
Ow.

39
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:12,561
Ow.
Chris, get back here!

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,982
Chr-i-i-i-is!

41
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:21,936
Chris!

42
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:24,156
Chris!

43
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:32,464
Oh, my God.
Somebody, help!

44
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:41,289
Aaaah!

45
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,340

47
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:07,649
Leave me alone!
I said shut up!

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,784
Just stop! Stop!

49
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:11,837
You are what you are.

50
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:13,755
You will kill again.

51
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,540
I won't. I swear.

52
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:55,580
Somebody
better be chasing you.

53
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:57,249
It's good for you.

54
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,867
No. No, it's not good for you.
Look at you.

55
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,537
Y-you're a mess,
and you stink.

56
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:04,890
Well, while you were out
being Lance Armstrong...

57
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:06,474
That would be biking.
...I was working.

58
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,143
You ever heard of a town
called Prosperity, Indiana?

59
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,678
Has anybody?

60
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:12,880
Two of their fine citizens died
over the past two weeks.

61
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:15,550
This one chick --
she, uh, roasted underneath

62
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:18,453
one of those beehive hair dryers
at the hair salon,

63
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:22,023
and this other guy
boiled in a hot tub.

64
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,392
- You don't see a lot of that.
- No, you don't.

65
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:26,027
- It's worth checking out.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,915
You know, one more thing.

67
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:32,200
What's going on with you?

68
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:36,972
We have had
this conversation, Sam.

69
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:38,290
No, we haven't.

70
00:04:38,374 --> 00:04:42,761
See, to do that, you'd
have to, uh, sort of...speak.

71
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,079
Okay, let's see
if you can get this straight.

72
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:47,682
See [clears throat] you're --
you're new Sam, right,

73
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,884
Lance Armstrong.
Biking.

74
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:52,086
And, uh --
and I'm still me, okay?

75
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:55,140
All right, so -- so, you might
see things different now --

76
00:04:55,224 --> 00:04:57,258
call it a runner's high
or some crap --

77
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,526
but that doesn't mean

78
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:00,645
that something's going on
with me, okay?

79
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,782
Yeah, okay.

80
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:06,651
No, don't say, "yeah, okay,"
like, "yeah, okay."

81
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:08,370
Yeah, okay.

82
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:20,999
Yes, sir, I understand.

83
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,002
Yeah, I definitely do realize
this Winchester thing

84
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:27,472
is taking far too long,
and I'm sorry about that.

85
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:28,673
No worries.

86
00:05:30,142 --> 00:05:33,061
I can be there
in a day and a half.

87
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:34,462
Yeah, I'll hit the road now.

88
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:37,315
Just stopped
.

89
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,968
Thanks.
It'll be my pleasure.

90
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:57,502
I'm very sorry.

91
00:05:57,586 --> 00:05:59,788
I-I know this is a tough time
to have to talk about all this.

92
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,707
I've already been through it
so many times with the lawyers,

93
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,275
the police,
the insurance guys.

94
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:05,927
Right.
I know. I know.

95
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:08,179
We just -- we have to conduct
our own separate investigation.

96
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:10,048
I'm sorry.
I know it's tough.

97
00:06:10,132 --> 00:06:14,619
Can I ask you -- did your sister
have any enemies?

98
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:15,887
Why do you ask that?

99
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:18,857
You think her death
wasn't accidental?

100
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:22,277
No. No, no, no. We just have to
consider every possibility.

101
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:25,647
Is there anyone who might
have wanted to harm her?

102
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:28,867
You don't live here,
so you don't know.

103
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:31,403
Everyone...loved Wendy.

104
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:34,372
She volunteered
at the church.

105
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:37,208
She ran a group for kids.

106
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:39,210
I was the big sister,

107
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:40,862
and <i>I</i> looked up to <i>her.</i>

108
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:46,051
What about this man who died --
Carl Dunlap?

109
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:47,419
- Did she know him?
- I don't think so.

110
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:48,753
Well, Wendy was
in real estate, right?

111
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:50,004
Carl was an architect.

112
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:51,423
Maybe they had
some business dealings?

113
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:54,092
If they had worked together,
I would've heard the name.

114
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:57,562
Agent Sambora...

115
00:06:57,646 --> 00:07:01,483
If someone did this
to my sister, find out who.

116
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:11,509
And nobody was back here
but Wendy.

117
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:13,227
No.

118
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,063
But I was only gone
for a minute.

119
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:17,682
You can't even crank
these things

120
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,584
past a certain temperature --
am I wrong?

121
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:21,836
If it started to blow a fuse
or something,

122
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:23,421
it would have shut down.

123
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:25,573
Oh.

124
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:28,293
Basically, you're saying that
this couldn't have happened.

125
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:30,244
Basically, I'm saying
it couldn't have happened.

126
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:35,984
The insurance adjusters
already did that.

127
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:38,353
Thanks for the heads-up.

128
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,025
Wait.
What kind of a coin?

129
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:46,644
It's not American.
I don't know where it's from.

130
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:49,814
It was wedged back
behind one of those machines.

131
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,366
Somebody
could have dropped it.

132
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,226
Of course,
they don't have pockets

133
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:53,678
in those robe thingies
that they make you wear.

134
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,571
I didn't realize
you were such a spa expert.

135
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:59,491
Shut up.
I observe with my eyes.

136
00:07:59,575 --> 00:08:00,875
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
whatever you say.

137
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:03,211
So, you thinking it must be
some kind of hex talisman?

138
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:04,612
Maybe.

139
00:08:04,663 --> 00:08:05,947
All right.
Pick me up.

140
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:07,715
Why don't you just
run home, Lance?

141
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:09,116
Dean --

142
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:10,635
Yeah, I'll be there
in a bit.

143
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:08,175
Oh, come on --

144
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,849
aaaah!

145
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:57,194
So, what do we know
about the vic?

146
00:09:57,195 --> 00:10:00,813
Dewey Stevens -- owner,
Dewey Stevens Construction,

147
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,649
biggest outfit in town.

148
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,085
Rotarian, methodist,
tenor,

149
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:07,838
blue-ribbon pecan pie champ,
asthmatic.

150
00:10:09,757 --> 00:10:12,809
We're a close-knit
community.

151
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:16,930
So, this, um,
pillar of the community --

152
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:21,501
he was taking a leak
before he, uh, sprung a few?

153
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:24,604
The crew had gone for the day.
Site was shut down.

154
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:37,367
Anything unusual
besides the nails in the eyes?

155
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,035
Well, we're...

156
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,904
still trying
to figure out

157
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:42,455
where they plugged in
the nail gun,

158
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:44,241
seeing as there's no generator
on the truck.

159
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:46,493
Well, when you figure that out,
let me know.

160
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,599
So, another victim
everybody likes.

161
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:11,434
Not everybody.

162
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,570
Another physically impossible
death.

163
00:11:13,654 --> 00:11:16,406
- You got any ideas?
- Cirque du Soleil?

164
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,860
Oh, I, uh, found
another one of these,

165
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:23,229
just like at the, uh,
the hair-dryer/brain-roast.

166
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:26,416
And I found a connection
with all the vics.

167
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,702
These e-mail logs show
Wendy, the real-estate chick,

168
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:30,520
Carl, the architect,
and this Dewey guy

169
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:32,756
were all working on a
shopping-center project together.

170
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,541
Why didn't we know
about that?

171
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:36,176
Well, it all fell apart
for some reason.

172
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:38,628
I mean, there are
these e-mails back and forth,

173
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:40,430
pretty hot and heavy,
and suddenly they just stopped.

174
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:42,849
So, everybody working
on this project has died?

175
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,184
Well, not yet.

176
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,970
They were working
with a developer,

177
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,805
a guy named Don Stark.

178
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:52,342
Don Stark?
Why do I know that name?

179
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:57,647
Man, this Stark guy
is really plugged in, huh?

180
00:11:57,732 --> 00:12:00,933
So, all the players in this --
this shopping-center project

181
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:03,820
have either
fried, boiled, or kebabbed.

182
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:06,573
He could be next.

183
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,241
Really?

184
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,276
From a freaking flask?

185
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:11,745
What are you, bad Santa?

186
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:15,048
- On the job?
- We're always on the job.

187
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:19,336
All right.
Bobby e-mailed back.

188
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,972
I sent him a few pics
of those coins you found.

189
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:24,424
He says the writing
is Romanian cyrillic,

190
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:27,060
used only in the mid-15th
to the 19th century.

191
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:29,679
Apparently, it's an antique
Wallachian ducat.

192
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:30,963
So, we're looking
for an old Romanian?

193
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,769
You know, is it just me,
or is this really weird?

194
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,904
Huh.

195
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:39,990
I've seen this once before,

196
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:41,641
where t-the plants
are all dead in one spot.

197
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,326
Where?

198
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:45,662
A bus bench with
Wendy Goodson's picture on it.

199
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,418
I mean, I'm no expert, but
I don't think plants are

200
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:48,643
supposed to act like this.

201
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,786
? No one knows he's crying ?

202
00:12:54,422 --> 00:13:00,010
? no one knows
he's dying on the inside ?

203
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:05,832
? 'cause he's laughing
on the outside ?

204
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:09,436
? mm, no one knows ?

205
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,770
If the bureau's involved,

206
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:12,672
I assume you think
all three were murdered.

207
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:14,057
It's looking that way,
yes.

208
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,975
Now, Mr. Stark,
you had a relationship

209
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:18,311
with all three victims,
correct?

210
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,480
Oh, I knew them in business
circles, I guess, sure.

211
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:21,848
And you were all involved

212
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,233
in a, uh,
a-a shopping-center project.

213
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:25,235
Why'd that fall through?

214
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:26,986
Uh, t-these things happen.

215
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,906
Oh. Jenny.

216
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,958
These gentlemen
are from the FBI.

217
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:34,044
- Jenny Klein, my assistant.
- Hi, there.

218
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:36,079
Okay, Don,
I'm off to the cleaner's,

219
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,197
and then I'm gonna stop
at Beaman, Beaman, and Beaman

220
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:39,632
for the revised
contracts.

221
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,835
Hurry on back. You know how
things fall apart without you.

222
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:43,136
Oh.

223
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:46,890
Oh, I baked you some cupcakes --
coconut.

224
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:49,476
Coconut --
you're too good to me, Jenny.

225
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:50,643
Oh. I'll see you soon.

226
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:57,550
She bakes cupcakes.

227
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:58,985
Yummy.

228
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:00,987
You know what? Could you
point me to the restroom?

229
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:02,555
I had a little bit
too much java.

230
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:04,390
Yeah, around the corner,
down the hall.

231
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:05,992
Thanks.

232
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:08,995
So, uh, usually
in cases like these --

233
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:10,864
are there
cases like <i>these?</i>

234
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:12,248
Oh, you'd be surprised.

235
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,167
Uh, we start out
with the basics.

236
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:15,752
You have
any business rivals?

237
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:18,138
Sure, tons.
You know, real estate's brutal.

238
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:20,090
Well, that was easy.

239
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:21,291
On the other hand,

240
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,542
I've demonstrated my love
for this town,

241
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:23,743
and I think it's safe to say

242
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:25,211
I'm respected
for what I've done here.

243
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:26,573
Yeah, one
of my real treasures.

244
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:32,078
"To Don -- take no prisoners.
D. Trump."

245
00:15:32,145 --> 00:15:34,247
The Trumpster!
Wow.

246
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:37,450
Like I said, success breeds
fierce competition,

247
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,819
but in the end, everyone here
respects and admires me.

248
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,820
Including your wife?

249
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:44,657
Sorry.
It's just,

250
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,759
we heard the two of you
were splitting up, right?

251
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:50,480
Yeah, that's, uh --
that's what we heard.

252
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:52,849
Yeah, Maggie and I
are going through a tough time.

253
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:55,602
It's a separation --
temporary.

254
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,937
Sometimes, you know,
you grow apart.

255
00:15:58,005 --> 00:15:59,973
It's no one's fault.

256
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:01,524
Now, how would you
describe

257
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:05,111
the, uh -- the issues
between you and your wife?

258
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:07,981
Just one of those marital
misunderstandings, you know.

259
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,700
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.

260
00:16:10,784 --> 00:16:15,488
It's one of those vague,
hard-to-define passages.

261
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,457
She caught you
cheating, huh?

262
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:19,158
I couldn't help
but notice, uh,

263
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,029
things were kind of cordial
between you and your assistant.

264
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:26,132
Pretty good with the ladies
there, Mr. Stark?

265
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:27,667
It's a blessing and a curse,
isn't it?

266
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:28,885
Guys,
I'm a people person,

267
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:31,921
and I admire
dynamic, confident women.

268
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:32,839
"Admire"?

269
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:40,146
Okay, look --
it's true I had a recent...

270
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:42,765
little thing
with a business associate,

271
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,100
but that's all it was.

272
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:45,602
- A "thing"?
- Yeah.

273
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:47,270
Like a -- like a shoe
or a golf club.

274
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:48,855
Right. Like a waffle iron.
Yeah.

275
00:16:48,906 --> 00:16:51,241
Yeah. No, see, Don, uh, wives
generally think of an affair

276
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,692
as something
more than a thing.

277
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:55,411
Yes, and when Maggie
found out about it,

278
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:57,997
she needed some time off,
temporarily.

279
00:16:58,065 --> 00:17:00,416
Now, if we were to guess

280
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:03,753
that the, uh, uh, business
associate was Wendy Goodson,

281
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:06,005
would we win
the weekend trip to Maui?

282
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:08,574
No, her death had nothing to do
with the affair.

283
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:10,576
It was over
long before her accident.

284
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:13,079
If it was an accident.

285
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:14,931
You're not implying
that Maggie was behind this.

286
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:16,349
No, we're not implying
anything.

287
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,185
We're just saying...
you should be careful.

288
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:21,638
And take her to dinner
and apologize.

289
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:24,256
Yeah, and, uh, grovel.
Wouldn't hurt.

290
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,447
Found a bunch of hex junk
in their stuff --

291
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:32,615
clearly her thing.

292
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,983
And the empty closet

293
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:37,103
didn't seem like she
was coming back anytime soon.

294
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:39,205
So, Don admires Wendy,
biblically,

295
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:40,540
Wendy dies weird,

296
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,159
and the scorned wife
is into the dark stuff.

297
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:45,328
While Don's
just in the dark.

298
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:47,380
Hmm. It's kind of
like "Bewitched."

299
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:49,832
You know, Don's Darrin,
doesn't even know it.

300
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:52,385
A lot laughs until,
uh, you cheat on your wife.

301
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:54,253
A "Bewitched" reference. Really?

302
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:56,973
Dude, Nicole Kidman
was in the remake.

303
00:17:57,057 --> 00:17:58,174
Redhead. Hello!

304
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:00,727
Look at
all these dead plants.

305
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:03,379
Huh. It's kind of like
the real-estate lady's place

306
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:05,631
and Don's statue thing.

307
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:07,317
You know,
if she's strong enough,

308
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:08,634
just being pissed off

309
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:11,070
is enough to send some
pretty bad vibes their way.

310
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:13,472
Literally kill off
everything around her

311
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:14,974
just by pms-ing at it.

312
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:17,610
Eeh. That's not creepy
at all.

313
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:20,813
Bobby, hey, it's Dean.
Listen --

314
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:23,066
Winchester.
Yeah, very funny.

315
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:26,419
So, we need
our kind of terminix.

316
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,421
A witch.

317
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,168
Yeah, we're headed over
to her place to get you

318
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,393
some more specifics,

319
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,543
so if you could just,
uh --

320
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:36,162
y-- thank y--

321
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:38,014
He's on it.

322
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:44,163
Don, keep it
in your pants, man.

323
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:56,542
<i>All circuits are busy.</i>

324
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:02,265
Mrs. Stark.

325
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:04,050
Could I have a moment?

326
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:05,768
Of course.

327
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:07,386
Um, would you mind coming back
in, say, a half an hour?

328
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:08,805
It's just a really bad time
right now.

329
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:10,273
It's very important
that I talk to you.

330
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:11,891
Of course,
and I'm happy to.

331
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:14,060
I'm just in the middle of an
emergency, so please come back.

332
00:20:14,111 --> 00:20:15,728
Thank you!

333
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:36,115
I'm sorry --

334
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,784
uh...
restless leg syndrome.

335
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:00,139
Spoiler alert --
Jenny Klein's next.

336
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,908
Swiped her photo
off a hex deck,

337
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:04,327
but Maggie's gonna notice
it's gone eventually.

338
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:07,246
We got to get over
to Jenny's.

339
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:34,506
Okay.

340
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:39,812
Hot.

341
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:50,873
Puterea magiei negre

342
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:55,328
te condamna
la suferinta si moarte.

343
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,419
Find the coin, now!

344
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:44,043
Come on, Sam!

345
00:22:58,591 --> 00:23:00,393
Okay.

346
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:09,660
There were tiny beating
hearts in my cupcakes.

347
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:12,762
There were hearts
in my cupcakes,

348
00:23:12,763 --> 00:23:14,146
hearts in my cupcakes!

349
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:17,166
That's never happened before!
Hearts in my cupcakes!

350
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:18,889
Should I slug her?

351
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,207
Give it a second.

352
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:26,366
Oh, my God.
What just happened?

353
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:27,534
You were hexed.

354
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:29,903
"Hexed"?

355
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:31,572
Who are you people?

356
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:33,540
What the hell do I do?

357
00:23:33,608 --> 00:23:35,375
What you do is you go in there
and you pack a bag,

358
00:23:35,443 --> 00:23:37,778
you get in your car,
and you go.

359
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:40,681
- Go where?
- It doesn't matter.

360
00:23:40,748 --> 00:23:42,866
Look, 500 or 600 miles
ought to do it.

361
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:45,552
You got someone real powerful
real pissed,

362
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:47,154
and they're trying
to get rid of you now.

363
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:49,123
In line with that,

364
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,225
you might want to cool things
with Don Stark.

365
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:53,527
Don Stark?

366
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:55,329
What are you
talking about?

367
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:56,446
You and Don.

368
00:23:57,816 --> 00:23:59,349
You know.

369
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,485
"You know"?

370
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,353
There's no "you know."

371
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:05,906
No?

372
00:24:07,492 --> 00:24:09,693
Don Stark is my boss.

373
00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:11,411
That's it.

374
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:13,580
He's married,
for God's sake.

375
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:15,332
Yeah, well...

376
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:18,669
Me and Don Stark.

377
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,053
Ew.

378
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:21,505
What are you doing?

379
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:23,390
Bunch these tables
more in the middle.

380
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:25,309
Give me a more air
between paintings.

381
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:26,760
Hey. Maggie, can you sign
for the flowers?

382
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:28,145
I've checked them.
They're fine.

383
00:24:28,212 --> 00:24:30,814
Thank you, Sue.
What would I do without you?

384
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:33,517
Oh, please, I like helping.
What are best friends for?

385
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:36,553
It's just been so tough to focus
with Don, the whole mess.

386
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:38,405
It's like he put a knife
right in your heart, isn't it?

387
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:39,823
Yes.

388
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:41,525
Was I wrong to tell you
about him and Wendy?

389
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:44,278
No. No. You think
I'd want you to stand by

390
00:24:44,362 --> 00:24:46,196
and watch him
make a fool of me?

391
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:48,582
- I love you for what you did.
- I love you, too.

392
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:51,401
No, no, no. The still life
doesn't go there.

393
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:53,120
It goes
on the left side.

394
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:56,072
So, uh, we're gonna need,
uh, one centerpiece

395
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:58,575
on each of the tables
and two at the back.

396
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:02,212
- Don.
- Where's my wife?

397
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:04,631
You mean the one
who's divorcing you?

398
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:06,884
Sue, I know you can hardly wait
until I'm out of the picture,

399
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:08,051
and I know
it's been a thrill

400
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:10,721
whispering lies
into Maggie's ear --

401
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:12,422
Oh, but they weren't lies,
were they, Don?

402
00:25:12,473 --> 00:25:14,808
I made one mistake --
one.

403
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:16,360
I sincerely doubt that.

404
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,862
This is between Maggie and me.

405
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,597
- It has nothing to do with you.
- What do you want, Don?

406
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:24,151
I'd like to speak
with you.

407
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:31,625
Make it quick.

408
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,493
Okay.

409
00:25:33,578 --> 00:25:35,379
You know what, Maggie?
I think I've been patient.

410
00:25:35,446 --> 00:25:36,713
And you've had your fun.

411
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:38,782
It was very creative,
the thing with Wendy,

412
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,417
but, you know,
enough is enough.

413
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:43,637
No, Don, enough is not enough,
not even close.

414
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:45,422
What do you want,
my oysters on a tray?

415
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:47,174
Well, now
that you mention it --

416
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:48,792
The fact is,
none of this was my fault!

417
00:25:48,843 --> 00:25:52,262
Maybe if you'd been
around a little more.

418
00:25:52,313 --> 00:25:55,766
But between the art and the
charity and that evil bitch Sue,

419
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:56,967
I was edged
right out of your life.

420
00:25:57,018 --> 00:26:00,604
Oh, boo-hoo,
Mr. Big Shot,

421
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:03,740
Mr. "I got to put my name
on every public works in town."

422
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:05,525
There was three of us
in this marriage --

423
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,244
me, you, and your ego.

424
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:10,414
That was the problem,
Don.

425
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:13,450
So, excuse me. I have
a charity event to arrange.

426
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:17,337
Two FBI agents came by,
asking questions.

427
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:21,425
Hunters, sweetheart --
that's what they are.

428
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:24,344
Oh, I can see you're terribly
concerned for my safety,

429
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:27,163
but don't worry --
I'll take care of it.

430
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:29,466
Maggie, this stops.
You hear me?

431
00:26:29,517 --> 00:26:31,635
As of now.

432
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:37,941
You're so cute when
you try to tell me what to do.

433
00:27:23,988 --> 00:27:25,439
Now she's
just getting nasty.

434
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:27,357
Killing the girlfriend
is one thing,

435
00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:28,825
but his
commemorative bust?

436
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:30,560
That's got to hurt.

437
00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:32,245
She'll take
the whole town out, Dean.

438
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,031
She don't care
who gets in the way.

439
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:35,699
Hey, Bobby. What do you got?

440
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:40,454
Yeah?
You think it'll take her out?

441
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:43,123
All right.

442
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:45,241
No, I don't need to write it
down. I'll remember. Go ahead.

443
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:47,177
Mm-hmm.

444
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:50,413
The -- wait.
Hang on. Hang on.

445
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:53,383
Yeah?
Wait. Wa--

446
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:55,519
ho-- ho-- hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

447
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:59,773
Okay, what was the --
what was that last one?

448
00:27:59,857 --> 00:28:01,475
Right.

449
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,592
Uh-huh.

450
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:05,095
I'll remember.
It's fine.

451
00:28:06,464 --> 00:28:10,117
Hello, everyone,
and thanks for coming.

452
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:11,434
Most of you know

453
00:28:11,486 --> 00:28:14,488
that philanthropy and art
are my two passions,

454
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,940
but what we've --
not there!

455
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:19,876
Where is the ice?
People will be here in seconds.

456
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:23,497
What we've assembled here
tonight

457
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:26,666
may be my crowning achievement,
not to be immodest.

458
00:28:29,587 --> 00:28:31,671
See? I told you.

459
00:28:31,756 --> 00:28:34,591
Everything's perfect.

460
00:28:34,642 --> 00:28:39,229
Yeah, you --
you just reminded me --

461
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,431
I have to check
on the finger sandwiches.

462
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,855
Dude. Pie.

463
00:28:51,242 --> 00:28:52,993
Ugh.
That is --

464
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:54,811
chicken feet,
just like the recipe calls for.

465
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:57,531
Butcher's fridge is down.
I can smell that.

466
00:28:57,615 --> 00:28:58,782
Uh, says
the power's been wonky

467
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,083
and that he's lost
so much product,

468
00:29:00,151 --> 00:29:01,201
he probably
won't make rent.

469
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:02,953
Ditto every shop
on the block --

470
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,122
nothing but burst pipes
and blackouts.

471
00:29:05,173 --> 00:29:06,706
He says
it's like all of a sudden,

472
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,258
the town ran out of luck.

473
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:09,709
So, coincidence, right?

474
00:29:09,794 --> 00:29:12,095
Uh...Yeah.

475
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:13,663
We're past the point
of dead flowers.

476
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:15,966
What can I say?
I guess the witch is pissed.

477
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:19,436
All right, let's, uh --
we better get a move on here.

478
00:29:19,503 --> 00:29:23,523
Why don't you just --
c-can you take the feet?

479
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:25,358
Ugh.

480
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:36,820
To us.

481
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:39,072
I couldn't have done it
without you.

482
00:29:39,157 --> 00:29:40,190
To us.

483
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:48,515
Aaaaah!

484
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,834
That is disgusting!

485
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:56,039
No.

486
00:30:00,228 --> 00:30:02,312
No.

487
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:06,549
Not my paintings.

488
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:09,986
Maggie?
What is going on?

489
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:12,055
He did this.

490
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:14,241
How could he?

491
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:15,525
He knew
what this meant to me.

492
00:30:15,576 --> 00:30:17,827
Do you mean Don?

493
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:19,946
Don rigged all this?

494
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,898
- Yes!
- But how?

495
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:26,002
Just trust me.

496
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,072
He wants to hurt me.

497
00:30:29,123 --> 00:30:31,091
Oh.

498
00:30:31,175 --> 00:30:33,743
I told you --
he's a dick.

499
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:37,047
But we'll get through this

500
00:30:37,098 --> 00:30:39,415
because
you have people who love you,

501
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:42,185
and he can't take that
away from you.

502
00:30:58,953 --> 00:31:02,489
Fine, Donald.

503
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:04,457
It's war.

504
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,798
What the hell?

505
00:31:22,326 --> 00:31:23,176
Whoa.

506
00:31:25,462 --> 00:31:28,131
Clean-up on aisle 7.

507
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:31,467
Okay, I don't guess she'd
do this to her own auction.

508
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,853
No, obviously it was someone
who hated her guts

509
00:31:33,938 --> 00:31:35,388
and wanted her party
trashed.

510
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:39,025
Don Stark.

511
00:31:40,778 --> 00:31:42,412
So, the mister's a witch,
himself.

512
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:44,497
That means we got
not just <i>one</i> pissed-off witch.

513
00:31:44,582 --> 00:31:46,616
We've got <i>two.</i>
<i>It's full-on "War of the Roses."</i>

514
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,818
"Bewitched"
just got a lot less funny.

515
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:50,704
It's like
when they switched Darrins.

516
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,725
Where is she?

517
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,172
She'll be here.

518
00:32:17,173 --> 00:32:18,790
They've been
throwing thunderbolts

519
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:20,259
at each other's
favorite toys.

520
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,461
There's nothing left to destroy
but each other.

521
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:25,831
- This is basically ground zero.
- I hope so.

522
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:27,755
We're gonna need them
both in the same place

523
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:28,651
if we're gonna take them down.

524
00:32:28,652 --> 00:32:30,635
Screens up, Captain.

525
00:32:40,813 --> 00:32:43,115
Want one, sweetie?
Shove it.

526
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:44,867
We are so having it out
right now.

527
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,489
Furor divina virtute
in infernum eam detrude!

528
00:32:55,095 --> 00:32:56,795
Let me guess --

529
00:32:56,846 --> 00:32:57,829
chicken feet?

530
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:00,999
Not chilled?

531
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:04,853
For obvious reasons,
you won't be leaving this room.

532
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:07,856
Well, you will be leaving --
just not alive.

533
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:09,308
Maggie?

534
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,945
Puterea magiei negre...

535
00:33:13,012 --> 00:33:14,797
- Okay, plan "B."
- What's plan "B"?

536
00:33:14,864 --> 00:33:16,565
Talking.
...La suferinta...

537
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:18,033
Now? Really?

538
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:19,651
This is obviously
a domestic dispute.

539
00:33:19,703 --> 00:33:22,654
So if you can't kill them,
counsel them.

540
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:24,740
Yeah. You know what?
Not my area!

541
00:33:24,824 --> 00:33:27,876
...Supune-te
ordinelor mele --

542
00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:29,361
okay, okay, okay.
Uh...

543
00:33:29,412 --> 00:33:32,364
Look -- obviously, you two

544
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:34,299
are capable of wiping
each other out, right?

545
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:37,636
But you haven't, huh?

546
00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:41,090
Which means
that you two --

547
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:44,626
you still value
whatever it is you got.

548
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:48,097
A-and you want keep
that dance going.

549
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:52,484
Maybe it's --
maybe it's punishment.

550
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:54,486
Maybe it's --
it's sick, messed-up,

551
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:56,572
erotic,

552
00:33:56,656 --> 00:34:00,058
kinky, "clamps and feathers"
kind of love.

553
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,940
Okay, okay, t-that's --
that's going way too

554
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:02,694
deep, there, cowboy.

555
00:34:02,695 --> 00:34:05,164
Look, what he's trying to say
is that -- is that you two --

556
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:07,783
whatever it is you have,
you're bonded.

557
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:10,335
Are you out of your mind?

558
00:34:10,403 --> 00:34:12,621
He cheated on me,
humiliated me.

559
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:15,424
We're not trying to say
what Don did was right.

560
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,909
When a relationship cracks,

561
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:20,179
usually both parties
have a hand in it.

562
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:21,263
Indeed.

563
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:23,582
You're defending him?

564
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,385
- Ugh!
- Whoa! Okay, okay!

565
00:34:26,436 --> 00:34:28,353
Okay, look --
n-nobody can defend Don.

566
00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:30,255
Right? Uh, totally.

567
00:34:30,306 --> 00:34:34,393
But, uh, we get that you feel
betrayed...because you were.

568
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:36,311
Don't suck up to her.

569
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,568
I was betrayed
by all of them.

570
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:45,821
Carl introduced you to Wendy.
Dewey covered for you.

571
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:47,939
- Wendy <i>did</i> you!
- Okay, okay, look --

572
00:34:47,991 --> 00:34:51,443
I got to say I-I don't think
don was lying when he said

573
00:34:51,494 --> 00:34:53,462
he regrets
the whole Wendy thing.

574
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:55,881
"Thing"?

575
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,718
- Sit down.
- Aah! Ohh!

576
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:01,620
Yeah, affair --
that's right, terrible.

577
00:35:03,006 --> 00:35:05,641
I think the only thing
he regrets is getting caught.

578
00:35:05,725 --> 00:35:07,059
Wendy was nothing to me.

579
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:08,894
It was over
as soon as it started.

580
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:10,312
She was
part of a pattern, okay?

581
00:35:10,396 --> 00:35:11,513
I've had 800 years
of this.

582
00:35:11,598 --> 00:35:13,232
Do not make me bring up
the Renaissance!

583
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:15,300
Oh! Oh!
You're one to talk.

584
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:16,902
1492 ring any bells?

585
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:18,520
The man
was about to set sail!

586
00:35:18,605 --> 00:35:20,989
He could possibly fall off
of the edge of the earth.

587
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:23,492
I took pity.
So, what's your excuse?

588
00:35:23,576 --> 00:35:26,945
I told you -- nothing happened
with the Medici chick!

589
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:28,447
You've always been
insanely jealous.

590
00:35:28,498 --> 00:35:30,949
Oh, I wonder why!
Jenny. Wendy.

591
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,036
Jenny? Nothing happened with
Jenny. She's just my assistant.

592
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,587
That's true.

593
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:38,207
She, uh -- she told us --
just an assistant.

594
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:40,659
Whoa!

595
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,844
Is that true?

596
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:43,679
Yes, I swear it, babe.

597
00:35:43,763 --> 00:35:44,829
I would never.

598
00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:49,601
I made a mistake.

599
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:51,186
I'm sorry, Maggie.

600
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:56,859
See? See?

601
00:35:56,943 --> 00:36:01,346
Guys, guys...
You're talking.

602
00:36:01,397 --> 00:36:03,482
All these years,
you -- you buried your anger

603
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:06,851
and your disappointment
till it tore you apart.

604
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:08,437
All you needed to do
was talk.

605
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:10,989
And I would have missed the
nuking that my melon just took.

606
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,574
Well, who wants that?

607
00:36:18,531 --> 00:36:20,465
- Nice touch.
- Thank you.

608
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:29,591
He's right.

609
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:31,376
I couldn't kill you.

610
00:36:31,427 --> 00:36:33,896
All I ever wanted
is you, Mags.

611
00:36:35,381 --> 00:36:38,183
I've been crushing on you
since forever.

612
00:36:38,234 --> 00:36:42,321
You're the woman that
I want to never grow old with.

613
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:44,889
I could never murder you
either, Don.

614
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,943
It's crazy...
But true.

615
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:56,735
Somebody want to call
these things off?

616
00:36:56,786 --> 00:36:59,721
Ex-- excuse me!

617
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:19,745
Oh, give me a break.

618
00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:20,754
I didn't say anything.

619
00:37:20,755 --> 00:37:22,589
It's been a long day.

620
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,008
And it's not over yet.

621
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,928
Hi, Sam.

622
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,796
Hi, Dean.

623
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:32,499
Do we know you?

624
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:35,385
Well, I definitely know you.
You're the dead guys.

625
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:37,988
Well, you will be
in a minute.

626
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,881
Sorry.
You're a bit outmatched.

627
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,388
Don.

628
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:13,440
Thank you.
We owe you.

629
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,275
Good God.
What is that thing?

630
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,610
I guess we should be figuring
that out.

631
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,478
It is
on our to-do list.

632
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,031
You know, find a bottomless pit
and drop it in.

633
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,450
Spell only lasts
for a few days.

634
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,405
Uh, what are you
even doing here?

635
00:38:28,456 --> 00:38:31,774
Apparently,
saving your lives --

636
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:33,493
twice.

637
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,412
Got it.

638
00:38:35,463 --> 00:38:36,796
Maggie? Seriously?

639
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,916
She was gonna kill us? We
just saved your damn marriage.

640
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:44,120
Yeah, but to be fair,
you also tried to kill her.

641
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:47,307
You know how she is
when she gets a bug up her ass.

642
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,758
Got to love her, right?

643
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:52,429
Right.

644
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,980
Bottomless pit.

645
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,745
Yeah, he's ready
for transport.

646
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:11,414
I just hope you got someplace
you can put him, Bobby.

647
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,700
All right.

648
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,836
We should hit the road.
You ready?

649
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,923
Hey, were you, um --

650
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,592
were you listening
to the Starks tonight?

651
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:25,512
Uh, a little,

652
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,131
when I wasn't getting slammed
into a wall or stung by bees.

653
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,851
You notice how they, uh --
you know,

654
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,520
how they --
how they opened up,

655
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,171
got everything
off their chest?

656
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:37,006
Yeah. Kudos on selling them
that crap.

657
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:39,342
It wasn't crap,
Dean. It worked.

658
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:46,015
Sam, I am so very, very,
very, very...Very, very tired --

659
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,484
Dean, like it or not,

660
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:49,736
the stuff you don't talk about
doesn't just go away.

661
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,489
It builds up, like whatever's
eating at you right now.

662
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,075
There's <i>always</i>
<i>something eating at me.</i>

663
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,459
That's who I am.

664
00:39:56,527 --> 00:40:00,046
Something happens,
I feel responsible, all right?

665
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,198
The Lindbergh baby --
that's on me.

666
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:03,366
Unemployment -- my bad.

667
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:04,884
That's not what
I'm talking about.

668
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,553
Well, then what the hell
are you talking about?

669
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:09,389
I'm talking about whatever
you're not telling me about.

670
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:15,061
Look, Dean, it's fine.
You can unload.

671
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,880
That's kind of
what I'm here for.

672
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:27,023
I mean...
We're good, right?

673
00:40:27,074 --> 00:40:29,075
We're good.
