1
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:05,474
I let Lucifer out.

2
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:06,539
I got to
put him back in.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,590
Yes.

4
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:09,713
Sammy's long gone.

5
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:12,082
Sam has been
locked in the cage

6
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,501
with Michael and Lucifer.

7
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,638
It's his soul.
It's gone.

8
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:22,059
? Take it easy ?

9
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:23,761
Can't erase Sam's Hell,

10
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:25,929
but I can put it behind a wall.

11
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:27,564
Keep digging, Dean.

12
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:28,766
So you're just
gonna be cryptic, or...

13
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,267
It's about the souls.

14
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:31,452
I will save Sam,

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,188
but only
if you stand down.

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,073
- What happened to you, Cass?
- I'm at war.

17
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:39,226
I want to discuss
a simple business transaction.

18
00:00:39,277 --> 00:00:40,911
- That's all.
- You want to make a deal?

19
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:41,945
With me?

20
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,830
It's the souls.

21
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:47,868
? We can roll all night ?

22
00:00:49,838 --> 00:00:54,091
? ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ?

23
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:57,511
? slow ride ?

24
00:00:57,578 --> 00:00:59,113
? take it easy ?

25
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,547
They're all inside me --

26
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:02,749
millions
upon millions of souls.

27
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,718
? Slow down ?

28
00:01:05,603 --> 00:01:07,421
Angel blade won't work,

29
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:08,939
because I'm not an Angel
anymore.

30
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:10,524
I'm your new God.

31
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:12,059
You will bow down

32
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,445
and profess your love unto me,
your Lord...

33
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:17,481
...Or I shall destroy you.

34
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,723
Well...

35
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,058
All right, then.

36
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,593
This good or...

37
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:48,729
you want the whole
forehead-to-the-carpet thing?

38
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:52,983
Guys?

39
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:57,438
Stop.

40
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,525
What's the point
if you don't mean it?

41
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:03,660
You fear me.

42
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:05,579
Not love, not respect --
just fear.

43
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:08,198
Cass --

44
00:02:08,283 --> 00:02:10,200
Sam, you have nothing
to say to me.

45
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:11,618
You stabbed me in the back.

46
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:14,254
Get up.

47
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,826
Cass, come on.
This is not you.

48
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:22,629
The Castiel you knew is gone.

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,848
So what, then?
Kill us?

50
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:27,217
What a brave little ant
you are.

51
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:28,852
You know you're powerless.

52
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:30,521
You wouldn't dare
move against me again.

53
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:32,356
That would be pointless.

54
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,224
So I have no need to kill you.

55
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:35,392
Not now.

56
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:38,445
Besides...

57
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:40,614
Once,
you were my favorite pets,

58
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:42,983
before you turned and bit me.

59
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:45,352
- Who are you?
- I'm God.

60
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:48,989
And if you stay in your place,
you may live in my kingdom.

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,708
If you rise up,
I will strike you down.

62
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:54,211
Not doing so well,
are you, Sam?

63
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,697
I'm fine.

64
00:02:57,749 --> 00:02:58,949
I'm fine.

65
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:00,367
You said you would fix him.
You promised!

66
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:03,387
<i>If</i> you stood down,
which you hardly did.

67
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:08,425
Be thankful for my mercy.

68
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,260
I could have cast you
back in the pit.

69
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:13,430
Cass, come on,
this is nuts.

70
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,732
You can turn this around.
Please!

71
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:18,569
I hope, for your sake,
this is the last you see me.

72
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:28,228
Sam, you okay?

73
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,696
Sam.

74
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:39,456
Understand --

75
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,625
if you followed Raphael,

76
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,877
if you stood against me,

77
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:46,463
punishment <i>is</i> certain.

78
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:49,550
There is nowhere to hide.

79
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:51,852
The rest of you...

80
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,639
Our father left a long time ago.

81
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:58,192
That was hard.

82
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:01,761
I thought the answer
was free will.

83
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:03,981
But I understand now.

84
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,119
You need a firm hand.

85
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,408
You need a father.

86
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,878
And <i>I</i> am your father now.

87
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:23,217
Be obedient, children...

88
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:26,870
or this will be your fate.

89
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:32,175
It is a new day,

90
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,429
on Earth and in Heaven.

91
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:39,433
Rejoice.

So, you fixing her
or primal screamin'?

97
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:14,384
Thanks.

98
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:17,187
How's Sam?

99
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:19,640
He's still under,
but alive.

100
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:21,341
Yeah.

101
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:23,560
What about
God part deux?

102
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:25,862
I got all kinds
of feelers out.

103
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:27,064
So far, diddly.

104
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:30,400
And what exactly
are you looking for?

105
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:31,818
Exactly. What?

106
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:33,737
Miracles, mass visions,

107
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,872
trench coat on a tortilla?

108
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:37,958
I don't know
what I'm looking for.

109
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,526
Yeah, well,
he'll surface.

110
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:41,161
So, say we do suss out

111
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:43,196
where new and improved
flew off to.

112
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:44,331
Yeah?

113
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:47,000
The hell we plan
to do about it?

114
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:48,385
Well, I don't know, Bobby.

115
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:50,203
I got no more clue
than you do.

116
00:05:50,254 --> 00:05:52,172
I don't even know what books
to <i>hit</i> for this, Dean.

117
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:53,473
Well, figure it out!

118
00:05:57,312 --> 00:05:58,929
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:05,902
This ain't in no book.

120
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:07,771
If you stick your neck out,
Cass steps on it.

121
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,776
So, you know
what I'm gonna do?

122
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,494
What?

123
00:06:14,562 --> 00:06:17,564
I'm gonna fix this car...

124
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:20,066
Because
that's what I <i>can</i> do.

125
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:21,952
I can work on her
till she's mint.

126
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:25,088
And when Sam wakes up,

127
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:27,090
no matter
what shape he's in,

128
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:29,543
we glue him
back together, too.

129
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:31,678
We owe him that.

130
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:33,013
I'm with you.

131
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:43,106
Hey, Dean.

132
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:46,677
Wow, you're, uh,
walking and talking.

133
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:47,761
Yeah!

134
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:50,564
I, uh...

135
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:53,600
Put on my own socks --
whole nine.

136
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:56,370
Well, that's, um...

137
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:57,988
I mean, uh, you...

138
00:06:58,072 --> 00:07:00,457
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

139
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:04,007
My head hurts a little,
but...basically.

140
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:04,745
Seriously?

141
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,080
Look, man, I'm as surprised
as you are,

142
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,249
but, yeah, I swear.
- Good.

143
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,353
No reason putting a gift horse
under a microscope, right?

144
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:14,105
- Yeah.
- So what happened with Cass?

145
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:16,423
Why don't you
come help me with the car,

146
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:17,507
and I'll fill you in?

147
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:18,341
Okay.

148
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:40,914
Plenty speak for them
and their so-called lifestyle --

149
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:42,916
media, Hollywood.

150
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:45,335
Lady Gaga won't shut up
for love or money.

151
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:47,704
Yeah, funny.

152
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:50,490
But that's why we raise
our voices

153
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,511
and picket their so-called
weddings and their funerals.

154
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,999
Someone has to speak for God.

155
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:02,853
And who says
you speak for God?

156
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,171
You're wrong.

157
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:06,172
I am utterly indifferent
to sexual orientation.

158
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,525
On the other hand...

159
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:12,779
I cannot abide hypocrites
like you, Reverend.

160
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:14,364
Okay, fun's over, friend.

161
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,950
Tell your flock
where <i>your</i> genitals have been

162
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:18,785
before you speak for me.

163
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:22,372
And who the heck are you?

164
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:23,406
I'm God.

165
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:37,170
And he who lies in my name shall
choke on his own false tongue

166
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:40,340
and his poisonous words
shall betray him.

167
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,651
For I am the Lord...

168
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,770
Your God.

169
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,114
No, no, no.

170
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:40,217
No, no, no, no.
This can't be happening.

171
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:46,323
Hey, Sam?

172
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:48,041
What are you,
taking a nap down here?

173
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,499
It's Cass, we think.
Come on.

174
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:59,619
Yeah. Coming.

175
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:02,339
<i>Sudden deaths</i>
<i>of some 200 religious leaders</i>

176
00:10:02,423 --> 00:10:04,123
<i>are currently</i>
<i>under investigation.</i>

177
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:06,092
<i>The Vatican has yet</i>
<i>to issue a statement,</i>

178
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:09,346
<i>but some are already</i>
<i>calling this an act of God.</i>

179
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,264
<i>We all saw him --</i>

180
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:14,818
<i>no beard, no robe.</i>

181
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:16,853
<i>He was young...</i>

182
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:20,574

194
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:49,603
Motivational speakers?

195
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,054
Yeah.

196
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:54,391
I'm not sure new Cass gets irony
any better than old Cass.

197
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:57,010
Course, old Cass...

198
00:10:57,061 --> 00:11:00,313
Wouldn't smite Madison Square
Garden just to prove a point.

199
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:02,065
He is off the deep end
of the deep end.

200
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:04,567
And there's no slowing down.

201
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:06,620
So, what?
Try to talk to him again?

202
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,571
Sam.

203
00:11:08,656 --> 00:11:09,906
Dean, all we <i>can</i> do
is talk to the guy.

204
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:12,993
He's not a <i>guy.</i>
<i>He's God, and he's pissed.</i>

205
00:11:13,044 --> 00:11:15,361
And when God gets righteous,
you get the hell out of the way.

206
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:17,247
- Haven't you read the Bible?
- I guess.

207
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:19,198
Cass is never coming back.

208
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,550
He has lied to us,
he used us,

209
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:22,636
he cracked your gourd
like it was nothing.

210
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:24,242
No more talk.
We have spent enough on him.

211
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:25,300
Okay.

212
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:26,714
Hand me that socket wrench.

? And now someone else
is getting all your best ?

220
00:11:57,922 --> 00:12:00,940
Hello, Crowley.

221
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:02,709
? These boots
are made for walkin' ?

222
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,127
You look stressed.

223
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:06,629
? And that's just
what they'll do ?

224
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:08,398

00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:11,982
? ...These boots are gonna
walk all over you ?

227
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:17,099
So...

228
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:18,984
The jig is up.

229
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:21,703
- You found me.
- I never lost you.

230
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:26,458
These scratches --
they're all useless.

231
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:29,694
Still, can't blame a girl
for trying.

232
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:31,463
You fancy a drink
before you smite me?

233
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:33,048
No.

234
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,501
You like to bend 'em right over,
do you?

235
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:36,919
Let's go.

236
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:43,475
I'm not going to kill you,
Crowley.

237
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:44,426
I have plans for you.

238
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,647
- What's that?
- Here's our new arrangement --

239
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:49,811
I let you live.

240
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,486
You return to your post
as king of hell.

241
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:52,651
But?

242
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:54,820
But I choose
where each soul goes.

243
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:56,321
But --
I control the flow,

244
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:58,740
and you take
whatever I give you.

245
00:13:01,945 --> 00:13:07,399
I take it you intend
to keep the lion's share.

246
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,368
So...

247
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:11,136
What you're saying
is Hell is being downsized.

248
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:12,871
I would have done away
with it completely,

249
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:17,543
but I need a threat
to hold over my enemies.

250
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:21,213
And we need to keep
Michael and Lucifer's Cage.

251
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:22,681
Right.

252
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:25,551
I gather this is not
a, uh, negotiation.

253
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:27,886
- No.
- Then I graciously accept...

254
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:29,188
Boss.

255
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:35,811
I'll be in touch.

256
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:08,510
Aah!

257
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,112
Dean?

258
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:29,081
Bobby?

259
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,659
She's looking good...
Considering.

260
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,211
Considering?

261
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,463
I should do this
professionally.

262
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:48,333
So...

263
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:50,686
Seen Sam lately?

264
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,055
Yeah, why?

265
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:56,858
What?

266
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:58,343
Well, spit it out.

267
00:14:58,394 --> 00:15:00,696
How is that kid
even vertical?

268
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,232
I mean, Cass broke
his damn pi?ata.

269
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,733
I know.

270
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:09,054
I mean, I get how he came
to help us, back at the lab.

271
00:15:09,122 --> 00:15:10,822
Adrenaline. Sure.

272
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:11,990
But now?

273
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,209
Well, he says he's okay.

274
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:15,544
How?

275
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:16,628
I don't know.

276
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,313
I just pray to God
it's true.

277
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:21,250
We need to come up
with a new saying for that.

278
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:28,307
Seriously, though, Bobby.
I mean, look at our lives.

279
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:30,709
How many more hits
can we take?

280
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,679
So if Sam
says he's good, good.

281
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,314
You believe that?

282
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:36,498
Yeah.

283
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:40,402
No.

284
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:44,773
You want to know why?

285
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:46,391
Because we never
catch a break,

286
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:49,745
so why would we this time?

287
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,864
But just -- just this one thing,
you know?

288
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:55,951
But I'm not dumb.

289
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:58,086
I'm not gonna
get my hopes up

290
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:00,973
just to get kicked
in the daddy pills again.

291
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,425
Hey.

292
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:08,297
Well,
how you feeling, sport?

293
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:09,681
Can't complain.

294
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:10,716
Great.

295
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:13,018
What's the word?

296
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:14,886
Well, a publishing house
literally exploded

297
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:16,305
about an hour ago.

298
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:17,773
Guys, the body count
is really getting up there.

299
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,090
We got to do something.

300
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:21,193
What we got to do
is hunt the son of a bitch.

301
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,061
Unfortunately,
I lost my God gun, so...

302
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:25,397
I mean, is there some kind
of heavenly weapon?

303
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,482
I mean, maybe something
out of that angel arsenal

304
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:29,117
that Balthazar stole?

305
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:30,719
There's got to be <i>something</i>
<i>that can hurt him.</i>

306
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:37,242
He's God, Sam.

307
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:40,278
There's nothing.

308
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,381
But there might be <i>someone.</i>

309
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,503
No.

310
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,757
No, no!

311
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:52,841
Come on!

312
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:55,310
Don't act so surprised.

313
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:58,129
My new boss is gonna kill me
for even <i>talking</i> to you lot.

314
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:00,265
You're lucky we're not stabbing
you in your scuzzy face,

315
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:01,650
you piece of --
- Wait, wait, wait.

316
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:04,302
- What new boss?
- Castiel, you giraffe.

317
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,737
Is your boss?

318
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:07,105
Is <i>everybody's</i> boss.

319
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:08,690
What do you think
he's gonna do

320
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:10,692
when he finds out
we've been conspiring?

321
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,362
You do want to conspire,
don't you?

322
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:15,864
No, we want you to just
stand there and look pretty.

323
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:16,998
Listening.

324
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,251
We need a spell.

325
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:20,335
To bind death.

326
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,088
Bind? Enslave death?

327
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:24,489
You having a laugh?

328
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,091
- Lucifer did it.
- That's Lucifer.

329
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:27,659
A spell's a spell.

330
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:31,513
You really believe you can
handle that kind of horsepower?

331
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:32,964
You're delusional!

332
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:35,984
Death is the only player
on the board left

333
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:37,803
that has the kind of juice
to take Cass.

334
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:41,022
They'll both mash us like peas.

335
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:42,607
Why should I help
on a suicide mission?

336
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:43,725
Look...

337
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:47,529
...You really want Cass
running the Universe?

338
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:53,985
Some help, please?

339
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:56,788
Please? Help?

340
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:58,457
Some help, please?

341
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:06,548
God bless you, sir.

342
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:08,550
You're a true believer.

343
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,201
People say I'm wrathful.

344
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:13,605
But I only punish liars
and those who forsake me.

345
00:18:13,673 --> 00:18:16,324
I am a just God.

346
00:18:16,392 --> 00:18:18,176
Excuse me?

347
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:25,567
See?

348
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,886
Oh, my God.

349
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:29,654
I can see!

350
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:35,494
Your face.

351
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:38,079
What's wrong with you?

352
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:45,370
<i>Mistake.</i>

353
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:48,039
<i>Cass.</i>

354
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:49,291
<i>Too late.</i>

355
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,259
<i>Let us out.</i>

356
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:54,212
<i>Let us through.</i>

357
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:58,433
<i>Let us out.</i>

358
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,227
No.

359
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:24,893
Hello?

360
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:34,218
It's from Crowley.

361
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:39,591
Well, who feels like
hog-tying death tonight?

362
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:43,511
Old age is overrated
anyhow.

363
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:45,447
Well, we got
most of this stuff,

364
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:47,816
but we're gonna have to
make a run for a few things.

365
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:49,033
Like?

366
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:52,687
Like "An act of God,
crystallized forever."

367
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:54,005
What's <i>that</i>
<i>supposed to mean?</i>

368
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:55,757
Thinking it means
an actual crystal.

369
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:58,576
See, lightning strikes sand
at the right angle,

370
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:01,546
it crystallizes into
the perfect shape of itself.

371
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:03,080
Lightning -- act of God.

372
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:04,582
Jenga.

373
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:06,451
You got yourself
a fulgurite.

374
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,085
We're gonna need a Biggie.

375
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:11,022
And let me guess -- rare.

376
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,607
I found the records
of an auction.

377
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:15,677
Winning bidder lives
about nine hours from here.

378
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,117
Hey!

379
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:41,452
Excuse me.
You got any Grey Poupon?

380
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:46,474
Grey Poupon?
Seriously?

381
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:49,727
It's what
popped in my head.

382
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:41,679
Hi.

383
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,781
Uh...

384
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:45,850
I don't want
to hurt you.

385
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:47,018
Really.

386
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:49,487
I'm the one
with the firearm, son.

387
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:54,042
I get that.

388
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:59,047
Okay.

389
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:02,050
Yeah. Good.

390
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:07,038
Hey, guys.

391
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:10,558
Uh, so this is
Dr. and Mrs. Weiss.

392
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:13,561
Hi.

393
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:14,846
Sorry.

394
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:15,880
I found the God thingy.

395
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:20,068
Well,
let's light this candle.

396
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,093
You're welcome.

397
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:59,423
<i>Te nunc invoco, mortem.</i>

398
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:04,929
<i>Te in mea potestate defixi.</i>

399
00:23:11,287 --> 00:23:14,956
<i>Nunc et in aeternum!</i>

400
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:33,725
Um...

401
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,793
Hello?

402
00:23:35,844 --> 00:23:37,845
Death?

403
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,648
You're joking.

404
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:44,736
I'm sorry, Death.
This isn't what it seems.

405
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:47,905
Seems like
you bound me.

406
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:50,575
For good reason, okay?
Just, uh, hear us out.

407
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:52,410
Um...

408
00:23:52,477 --> 00:23:54,028
Fried pickle chip?

409
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:56,614
They're the best
in the state.

410
00:23:56,665 --> 00:23:59,701
That easy to soothe me,
you think?

411
00:23:59,768 --> 00:24:03,004
This is about Sam's
hallucinations, I assume?

412
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:05,940
What?

413
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:08,960
Sorry, Sam.
One wall per customer.

414
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:10,595
Now unbind me.

415
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:12,030
We can't.

416
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,548
Y-yet.

417
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:15,767
This isn't
going to end well.

418
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,168
We need you to kill God.

419
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:19,937
Pardon?

420
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,139
Kill God.

421
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,473
You heard right.

422
00:24:22,524 --> 00:24:24,726
Your...Honor.

423
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,227
What makes you think
I can do that?

424
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:27,278
You told me.

425
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:31,315
Why <i>should</i> I?

426
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:36,287
Because...

427
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:39,707
We said so,
and we're the boss of you.

428
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:42,443
I mean...Respectfully.

429
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:45,163
Amazing.

430
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:49,801
Cass.

431
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,502
I didn't want to kill you,
but now...

432
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:53,187
You can't kill us.

433
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:54,572
You've erased any nostalgia
I had for you, Dean.

434
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,424
Death is our bitch.

435
00:24:56,508 --> 00:24:58,793
We ain't gonna die,
even if God pulls the trigger.

436
00:24:58,861 --> 00:25:02,230
Annoying little protozoa,
aren't they?

437
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:03,398
"God"?

438
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:08,469
You look awfully like
a mutated angel to me.

439
00:25:08,537 --> 00:25:11,189
Your vessel's melting.
You're going to explode.

440
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:12,740
No, I'm not.

441
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:15,993
When I've finished my work,
I'll repair myself.

442
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:17,495
You think you can
because you think

443
00:25:17,562 --> 00:25:20,731
you're simply under the weight
of all those souls, yes?

444
00:25:20,783 --> 00:25:23,251
But that's not
the worst problem.

445
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:26,087
There are things much older
than souls in Purgatory,

446
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:27,755
and you gulped
those in, too.

447
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,440
Irrelevant.

448
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:30,758
I control them.

449
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,210
For the moment.

450
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:34,829
Wait -- uh,
what older things?

451
00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:37,765
Long before God created
Angel and man,

452
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,884
he made the first beasts --

453
00:25:39,935 --> 00:25:42,336
the Leviathans.

454
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:43,688
Leviathans?

455
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:45,223
I personally
found them entertaining,

456
00:25:45,274 --> 00:25:48,476
but he was concerned they'd
chomp the entire petri dish,

457
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,479
so he locked them away.

458
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:54,215
Why do you think
he created Purgatory?

459
00:25:54,283 --> 00:25:58,986
To keep those clever,
poisonous things out.

460
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:01,739
Now Castiel
has swallowed them.

461
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,192
He's the one thin membrane

462
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:07,562
between the old ones
and your home.

463
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:08,880
Enough.

464
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:10,748
Stupid little soldier
you are.

465
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,800
Why?

466
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:15,736
Because I dared
open a door that he shut?

467
00:26:15,804 --> 00:26:18,639
Where is he?

468
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:20,558
I did a service,
taking his place.

469
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:21,726
Service?

470
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:23,311
Settling petty vendettas?

471
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:24,595
No.

472
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:27,582
I'm cleaning up one mess
after another --

473
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:28,566
selflessly.

474
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:30,234
Quite the humanitarian.

475
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:33,488
And how would you know?

476
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:36,274
What are you, really?

477
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:38,409
A flyswatter?

478
00:26:38,476 --> 00:26:40,728
Destined to swat you,
I think.

479
00:26:40,796 --> 00:26:43,664
Unless I take you first.

480
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:47,251
Really bought his own press,
this one.

481
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,754
Please, Cass.

482
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:51,956
I know God,

483
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:55,042
and you, sir, are no God.

484
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:57,128
All right, put your junk away,
both of you.

485
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:58,930
Look, call him what you want.
Just kill him now!

486
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:05,002
All right. Fine.

487
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:12,026
Thank you.

488
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:16,647
Shall we kickbox now?

489
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,020
I had a tingle I'd be
reaping someone very, very soon.

490
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,459
Don't worry -- not you.

491
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,698
Well, he was in a hurry.

492
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,301
Yes, that's exactly
why I'm running again --

493
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:38,803
to save my constituents

494
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,255
from the godless policies
of my opponents.

495
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,975
Couldn't have
said it better myself.

496
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:51,148
Sir?

497
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:52,316
Can I help you?

498
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:53,684
I'm here
to see the Senator.

499
00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:55,686
Um, regarding?

500
00:27:55,737 --> 00:27:57,405
Abuse of power.

501
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:59,574
Excuse me?

502
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:00,858
I am not petty.

503
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:02,827
I'm punishing a woman

504
00:28:02,894 --> 00:28:06,330
who causes poverty and despair
in my name.

505
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:09,700
I put your needs first.
Don't you understand?

506
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:12,119
All of you.

507
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:17,058
I am a better God
than my father.

508
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:19,460
How can I make you understand?

509
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:22,046
<i>Cass.</i>

510
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:35,977
Ahh.

511
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:39,113
Um...

512
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:41,649
Shut up, Dean.

513
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:44,768
I'm not here to tie your shoes
every time you trip.

514
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,440
I warned you about those souls
how long ago?

515
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:52,209
Long enough
to stop that fool.

516
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:53,661
And here we are again,

517
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:56,714
with your little planet
on the edge of immolation.

518
00:28:56,781 --> 00:28:58,049
Well, I'm sorry.

519
00:28:58,116 --> 00:28:59,917
All right?

520
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:02,003
I've been trying
to save this planet,

521
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:04,822
so maybe you should find
somebody better to tip off.

522
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,893
Maybe I should spend my effort
on a better planet.

523
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,645
Well, it's been amusing.

524
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:12,430
Wait,
h-hold on, hold on.

525
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:13,981
Just --
can you give us something?

526
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:16,183
You -- you have to care a little
bit about what happens to us.

527
00:29:16,268 --> 00:29:18,069
You know,
I really don't.

528
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:20,855
But I do find
that little angel arrogant.

529
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:22,657
Great.
Let's go with that.

530
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:27,094
Your only hope is to have him
return it all to Purgatory.

531
00:29:27,162 --> 00:29:28,829
Quickly.

532
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:30,031
We need a door.

533
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:33,000
You have everything you need
at that lab.

534
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:37,254
Get him to return there and
compel him to give up the power.

535
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:38,339
Compel?

536
00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:40,324
Figure it out.

537
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,427
But that door only opens
in the eclipse,

538
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:44,762
and that's over.

539
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:46,113
I'll make another.

540
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:49,467
3:59 Sunday morning,

541
00:29:49,518 --> 00:29:51,852
just before dawn.

542
00:29:51,937 --> 00:29:53,771
Be punctual.

543
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,690
Don't thank me.

544
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:57,892
Clean up your mess.

545
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:07,368
Try to bind me again,
you'll die before you start.

546
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:12,540
Nice pickle chips, by the way.

547
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:42,153
No.

548
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,154
No.

549
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:55,399
No.

550
00:31:07,796 --> 00:31:10,347
You want some coffee
with that?

551
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:12,299
It's 6:00 p.m. somewhere.

552
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,168
We got to hit the road.

553
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:16,787
I mean, how are we supposed to get
Cass to that lab by friggin' 3:59 a.m.?

554
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:19,173
We don't.

555
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:20,424
What do you mean,
"We don't"?

556
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:22,143
I mean, we can't bring
the horse to water,

557
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:24,395
and we can't
make it drink.

558
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:25,946
Why fool ourselves?

559
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:27,615
Dean, look, I know you think
that Cass is gone --

560
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:29,617
- it's 'cause he is.
- He's not!

561
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:32,369
He's in there somewhere,
Dean. I know it.

562
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:34,321
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

563
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:36,607
But, look, I was pretty far gone
sometimes myself,

564
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:37,875
and never
gave up on <i>me.</i>

565
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:39,376
Yeah, and it turns out

566
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:41,111
that you're about the same
open book as you've always been.

567
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:44,882
Hallucinations?
Really?

568
00:31:44,949 --> 00:31:46,133
I got to find out
from Death?

569
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,220
What was I supposed to do?

570
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:50,454
How about not lie?

571
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:53,457
How about tell me

572
00:31:53,508 --> 00:31:55,776
that you've got crazy crap
climbing those walls?

573
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:57,645
Why?

574
00:31:57,729 --> 00:31:58,795
You can't help.

575
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:03,184
You got a lot of pretty severe
crap swinging your way lately,

576
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:04,801
and -- and I thought --

577
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,355
what? I thought why burst the
one good bubble you had left?

578
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,858
It's under control.

579
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:12,526
<i>What?</i>

580
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:13,810
What, exactly,
is under control?

581
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:15,260
I know what's real
and what's not.

582
00:32:15,261 --> 00:32:15,828
Sam --

583
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,644
Dean, look, we can debate this
once we deal with Cass.

584
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,036
Yeah, you know
how I'm gonna deal?

585
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,523
I'm gonna stuff my piehole,
I'm gonna drink,

586
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,342
and I'm gonna watch
some Asian cartoon porn

587
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:31,495
and act like the world's
about to explode because it is.

588
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:37,501
Hey.

589
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:42,306
You got to be kidding me.

590
00:32:42,357 --> 00:32:45,776
"Massacre at the campaign office
of an incumbent Senator

591
00:32:45,843 --> 00:32:47,311
by a trench-coated man."

592
00:32:47,362 --> 00:32:48,662
There's security footage.

593
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,214
Well, I think reaching Cass
is, uh...out of the cards.

594
00:33:23,098 --> 00:33:24,548
Hey, Castiel.

595
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:27,851
Um...

596
00:33:27,903 --> 00:33:29,937
Maybe this is pointless.

597
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:33,890
Look...I don't know
if any part of you even cares,

598
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:38,495
but, um, I still think
you're one of us,

599
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:40,030
deep down.

600
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:44,067
I mean, way, way, way
off the reservation, but...

601
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:51,809
Look, we still have till dawn
to stop this.

602
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:53,243
Let us help.

603
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:55,713
Please.

604
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:12,029
Only if you
turn that off.

605
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:23,407
Sam?

606
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:26,910
Cass.

607
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:28,128
I heard your call.

608
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:35,102
I need help.

609
00:34:38,003 --> 00:34:39,055
We need the right blood.

610
00:34:39,056 --> 00:34:40,157
There's a small jar --

611
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:41,692
end of the hall,
s-supply closet.

612
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,114
Got it.

613
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:51,689
Dean?

614
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,791
What,
you need something else?

615
00:34:53,876 --> 00:34:55,043
No.

616
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:58,346
I feel regret,

617
00:34:58,414 --> 00:35:00,298
about you

618
00:35:00,382 --> 00:35:02,350
and what I did to Sam.

619
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,770
Yeah, well, you should.

620
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,856
If there was time,
if I was strong enough,

621
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:09,641
I'd -- I'd fix him now.

622
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,613
I just wanted to make amends
before I die.

623
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:17,315
Okay.

624
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:22,237
Is it working?

625
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,439
Does it make you
feel better?

626
00:35:24,506 --> 00:35:25,506
No.

627
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,277
You?

628
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:31,379
Not a bit.

629
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:39,737
I know. It all seems
so silly, doesn't it?

630
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,673
Hi, Sam.

631
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,592
Long time, no spooning.

632
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,344
You're not here.

633
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:48,096
You're in Hell.

634
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:52,267
Now, <i>that</i> you're right on.

635
00:35:56,355 --> 00:36:00,825
Meat hooks...Chains...

636
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,527
You.

637
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:05,663
It's not real.

638
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:11,669
It's just my brain
leaking memories from the cage

639
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:14,488
'cause of the wall
breaking down.

640
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,375
That's all.

641
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:18,659
Hmm.

642
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:20,878
That's very good,
your little theory.

643
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:23,497
It's wrong.

644
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:27,468
Sam, this isn't
you going guano.

645
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,270
Everything else is.

646
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:32,607
What?

647
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:35,443
<i>Everything...</i>

648
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,362
From the second
you sprung out of that lock box.

649
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,563
That's impossible.

650
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:41,232
No.
Escaping was impossible.

651
00:36:41,317 --> 00:36:43,451
I have to say,

652
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:46,154
I think this is
my best torture yet --

653
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:49,357
make you believe
that you're free and then...

654
00:36:50,743 --> 00:36:53,527
...Yank the wool
off of your eyes.

655
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,363
You never left, Sam.

656
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:57,799
You're still in the cage...

657
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:00,201
With me.

658
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:12,580
Hang in there.

659
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,215
Just a couple of minutes.

660
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:17,935
Where's Sam?
It's go time.

661
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:29,730
Sam?!

662
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,336
Damn it.

663
00:37:45,414 --> 00:37:46,714
That's good enough.

664
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,436
Okay, step right up, Cass.

665
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:04,565
<i>Ianua magna purgatorii,</i>

666
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,068

00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,918
I'm sorry, Dean.

00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,320
Cass?

679
00:39:19,013 --> 00:39:21,962
He's cold.

680
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:23,480
Is he breathing?

681
00:39:23,598 --> 00:39:25,132
No.

682
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,818
Maybe angels
don't need to breathe.

683
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:30,671
He's gone, Dean.

684
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:43,667
Damn it.

685
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:50,507
Cass, you child.

686
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:53,177
Why didn't you
listen to me?

687
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,266
Cass?!

688
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:02,269
Hey! Hey!

689
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:03,770
Okay.

690
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:05,472
All right.

691
00:40:06,724 --> 00:40:08,892
That was unpleasant.

692
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:10,561
Let's get him up.

693
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:12,696
Easy, there.

694
00:40:15,366 --> 00:40:18,986
I'm alive.

695
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:21,622
Looks like.

696
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:24,357
I'm astonished.

697
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:26,793
Thank you --
both of you.

698
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,582
We were mostly...
just trying to save the world.

699
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:34,985
I'm ashamed.

700
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:36,670
I really overreached.

701
00:40:36,721 --> 00:40:37,921
You think?

702
00:40:38,006 --> 00:40:40,540
I'm gonna find some way
to redeem myself to you.

703
00:40:40,592 --> 00:40:43,510
All right, well,
one thing at a time. Come on.

704
00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:45,262
Let's get you
out of here. Come on.

705
00:40:45,346 --> 00:40:47,397
I mean it, Dean.

706
00:40:47,482 --> 00:40:50,050
Okay. All right.

707
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:51,685
But let's go
find Sam, okay?

708
00:40:51,736 --> 00:40:54,554
You need to run now!

709
00:40:54,606 --> 00:40:56,223
I-I can't hold them back!

710
00:40:56,274 --> 00:40:57,574
Hold who back?

711
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:00,227
They held on inside me.

712
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:03,063
Dean, they're so strong.

713
00:41:03,114 --> 00:41:05,082
- Who the hell --
- Leviathan!

714
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:09,586
I can't fight them.

715
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:12,122
Run!

716
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:13,340
Go! Go get Sam!
Go get Sam!

717
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:17,261
Too late.

718
00:41:17,345 --> 00:41:18,378
Cass?

719
00:41:20,298 --> 00:41:23,517
Cass is -- he's gone.

720
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:25,352
He's dead.

721
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:27,688
We run the show now.

722
00:41:32,443 --> 00:41:33,644
Ah.

723
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:49,326
Oh, this is going to be
so much fun.
