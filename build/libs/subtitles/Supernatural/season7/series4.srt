1
00:00:01,764 --> 00:00:04,133
I'm having a difficult time
figuring out what's real.

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,137
You never left, Sam.

3
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:06,588
You're still in the cage
with me.

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,673
Let me see your hand.

5
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:08,623
I was with you
when you cut it.

6
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,391
I sewed it up.

7
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,426
This is real.

8
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:12,678
I'm a grade "A" freak,

9
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,179
but I'm managing it.

10
00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:16,148
- There was a job in town.
- Where's the body?

11
00:00:16,232 --> 00:00:17,315
- I let her go.
- Why?

12
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,567
You know me.

13
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:20,569
You know the kind
of person I am.

14
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:22,154
She's dropping bodies,
man,

15
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:23,689
which means
we got to drop her.

16
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,608
She killed her own mom
to save <i>me.</i>

17
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:27,609
I'm sorry
but it's that simple.

18
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,777
She's done.

19
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:29,578
Trust me.

20
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,581
Dean, please.

21
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:34,416
Okay.

22
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:36,368
You are what you are.

23
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:37,869
You will kill again.

24
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,505
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,156
That's impossible.

26
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,717
You're okay.

27
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,319
You're okay.

28
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:45,887
Oh, you're okay.

29
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:56,615
No!

30
00:01:56,699 --> 00:02:00,199

32
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:17,017
Sam.

33
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:21,779
Feels wonky.

34
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,365
What?

35
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:27,702
Working a regular job.

36
00:02:27,754 --> 00:02:30,722
Bobby'll call if anything flares
up on the Leviathan front.

37
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:33,725
In the meantime, you know you
want to work this case, Dean.

38
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,427
Cop on the wire sounded
dumbfounded.

39
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:36,728
No arguments.

40
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:38,063
It's kind of nice,
you know?

41
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:39,881
We're due for
a little cut and dry.

42
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:41,149
And, uh...

43
00:02:41,217 --> 00:02:43,935
You seem good.

44
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,320
I am.

45
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:46,605
For me.

46
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:47,773
By the way...

47
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:49,274
Thank you.

48
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:50,609
For?

49
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:51,943
Amy.

50
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:53,945
I know you didn't want
to let her go,

51
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,230
but it was the right thing
to do.

52
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,231
So, thanks.

53
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:57,565
No problem.

54
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:11,847
Welcome to Crazytown,
population -- one dead guy.

55
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:13,381
Who was he?

56
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:16,802
Uh, Matthew Hammond.

57
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:18,770
Seems to have been crushed
to death.

58
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:20,755
By?

59
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:22,307
Well, if we weren't on the
tenth floor, I'd say by a car.

60
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,707
It's going crazy.

61
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:40,659
Some kind of ghost?

62
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,327
With a license?

63
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:43,912
License to kill.

64
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:46,498
Seriously?

65
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:50,118
Huh.

66
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:53,922
What do you got?

67
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,957
I don't know.
Looks like some kind of powder.

68
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:57,292
Sulfur?

69
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:58,510
No. Just dirt.

70
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:00,345
Could be
"Christine"-like.

71
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:01,963
Ugh.

72
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:03,515
Even possessed cars
can't do stairs.

73
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,433
It's something spectral.

74
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:09,404
Check this out.

75
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:12,023
"AA, 10 years."

76
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:13,408
Dead <i>and</i> sober.

77
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:15,076
Double crappy.

78
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:17,379
There's a charge
keeps coming up.

79
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:20,248
50 bucks a month
at a place called Jane's.

80
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:22,483
All right.

81
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:24,286
Congrats
on your sobriety.

82
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:26,288
I'll go find out what Jane's.

83
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,089
I gave up AA for Lent.

84
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:29,674
We're not Catholic.

85
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,927
Always with the details.

86
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:33,179
AA gives me the jeebs.

87
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,832
Wow. Shocker.

88
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,380

89
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:37,121
Fine.

90
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,587
I'll hit the meeting.
You go hit on Jane.

91
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:45,361
Matt was a nice guy.
Kind of a tortured soul.

92
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:47,547
Join the club.

93
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:49,883
But he just seemed to have
a lot going on.

94
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:51,501
Any idea what it was?

95
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:53,052
Family, a girl?

96
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,705
He played it all pretty close
to the vest.

97
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:58,207
Something was eating at him,
though, the last time I saw him.

98
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,839
- He almost slipped.
- When?

99
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,441
Just before he died,
I guess.

100
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,359
Called me
from Neal's Tavern.

101
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:05,648
Said he was an inch away
from drinking.

102
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:07,056
So I ran over,
talked him off the ledge.

103
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,390
Well, do you know
what triggered it?

104
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,257
Like I said,
he didn't share much.

105
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,932
Oh. Hi.

106
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,318
May I help you?

107
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,736
Uh, yes.

108
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,955
I just had a few questions
about a customer of yours,

109
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,206
Name of Matthew Hammond.

110
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:26,575
Uh, sure.
He's not in trouble, is he?

111
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,828
Actually, Mr. Hammond
is no longer with us.

112
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,914
Oh.

113
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,098
Now it all makes sense.

114
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,817
What does?

115
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:36,218
He came in,
couple days ago,

116
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:37,719
Paid me three years
in advance

117
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:39,254
To keep his
monthly delivery going.

118
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,739
Where do the flowers go?

119
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,975
A Miss Elizabeth Duren.

120
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,644
You mind writing
Elizabeth's address down?

121
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,596
I'd like to pay her
a visit.

122
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,329
Here we go.

123
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:06,665
Meet Elizabeth Duren.

124
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:08,617
Died at 10.

125
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,202
Wow.

126
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,703
So, who was she?

127
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,456
I don't know.

128
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,342
Why don't we chew on it
back at the motel?

129
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,831
Elizabeth Duren.

130
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,133
Killed 10 years ago

131
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,350
when a neighbor backed out
of his driveway,

132
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,518
Didn't see her bike.

133
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,036
No one was ever charged.

134
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:29,888
- Police ruled it an accident.
- Let me guess.

135
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,390
The neighbor's
our tenth-floor pancake.

136
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,309
At least we know
he felt bad.

137
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,844
I mean, the flowers...

138
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,863
Kind of makes you wonder
if the guy wasn't drunk

139
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,815
when he ran her over.

140
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,350
Yeah.

141
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,902
All right.

142
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,238
Well, regardless,

143
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,873
now that we got a decent bead
on ghost rider,

144
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,208
let's go.

145
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,292
What?

146
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,794
Burn her bones.

147
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:55,214
Put her to rest.

148
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,884
The fun never stops.

149
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:29,031
Keep that thing
away from me!

150
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,874
All right.

151
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,462
911.
What is your emergency?

152
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,097
I need help.
There's a dog after me...

153
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:46,215
What is your address?

154
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,415
I don't know! I'm --

155
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,352
some restaurant somewhere.
I'm --

156
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,472
No.

157
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,229
No!

158
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,033
Sir, you need to calm down.

159
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:07,319
We'll send the paramedics.
Just tell me where you are.

160
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,754
Sir? Sir?

161
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:16,940
Ohh, another night
at the office.

162
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:18,691
Why don't you take
the first shower?

163
00:08:18,743 --> 00:08:19,892
Listen to this.

164
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:21,661
"A local man,
Christopher Fisher,

165
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:24,730
was ripped to shreds in a
wild-animal attack last night."

166
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:26,449
It <i>is</i> a dangerous world
out there.

167
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:30,703
He was in the restroom
of a diner.

168
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:32,589
Yeah,
that doesn't sound right.

169
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:34,740
Apparently, none
of the patrons saw anything.

170
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:36,543
Guy calls 911,
screaming about a dog,

171
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:39,229
but the operator
didn't hear anything, either.

172
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:40,563
Wow.

173
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:42,132
Looks like this guy
had a history with dogs.

174
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:43,716
Meaning?

175
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:44,917
Five years ago,
he was arrested

176
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:46,302
for running
a dog-fighting operation.

177
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,303
Classy.

178
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:48,605
All right.

179
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:50,807
So, what?
He causes so much misery

180
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:54,260
that some Rottweiler goes Cujo
on him from beyond the grave?

181
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:59,199
Wait a second.
Do...dogs even have ghosts?

182
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:00,900
First I've heard of it.

183
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:02,068
That sounds weird.
"Ghost Dog"?

184
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,037
No weirder than "Ghost Car,"
you know?

185
00:09:04,104 --> 00:09:05,738
You know what does
make sense?

186
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,740
Vengeance on the guy
that Michael Vick'd you.

187
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,042
I mean,
I'm no one to judge,

188
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:11,077
but it sounds to me
like that guy had it coming.

189
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:13,463
Maybe...

190
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:14,714
But maybe not.

191
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:16,633
So, he got busted,

192
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:17,801
got probation,

193
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:19,002
started volunteering
at an animal shelter.

194
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:20,570
- Yeah, 'cause he had to.
- At first, yeah.

195
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:22,672
But he kept going long after
he served his time.

196
00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:25,458
Looks like he got
really into it.

197
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,143
Raised a lot of money
for the cause.

198
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:28,794
- Huh.
- People change.

199
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:30,480
Yeah, tell that
to ghost dog.

200
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,436
All right.
Uh, get suited up.

201
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:38,021
Let's go check out
the body.

202
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:39,138
What?

203
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,973
- What?
- What? What?

204
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:43,026
Nothing. I...

205
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:44,160
You okay?

206
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:45,578
Peachy.

207
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:49,032
Yeah, let's do this.

208
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:52,318
So, guess what I found.

209
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:53,620
Red dirt.

210
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:55,205
Under his nails.
On his shoes, too.

211
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:57,657
- Just like the car-crash guy's floor?
- Yeah.

212
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,210
So, gotta be someplace
around here they both walked.

213
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:01,878
An apple farm?

214
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:03,463
Yeah.

215
00:10:03,514 --> 00:10:06,049
Apparently whatever's
in red dirt makes great apples.

216
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:08,468
Wow. I'd be <i>so</i> interested
in that if I ate apples.

217
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,937
So this one's
supposed to be pretty old,

218
00:10:11,004 --> 00:10:12,171
mostly abandoned.

219
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:13,439
Few hundred acres.

220
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:14,641
A few hundred?!

221
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:17,143
We're gonna be searching
all year.

222
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:29,072
Hey.

223
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:30,874
Uh...You okay?

224
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,626
Guy just jumped
in front of a car, Sam.

225
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:34,961
Uh, you want us
to help you, sir?

226
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:39,165
Okay, well, why don't we get you
out of here

227
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:40,083
before you get
roadkilled, huh?

228
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,001
Yeah.

229
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:48,708
So, Warren.
Just, uh, take a minute.

230
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,560
Tell us what's going on.

231
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:55,064
Look -- you're good people,
I can see that,

232
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:56,482
but you can't do anything
for me.

233
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,517
No one can.

234
00:10:57,568 --> 00:10:58,568
Why not?

235
00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:00,386
Cause it's all
impossible.

236
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:02,054
You won't even believe me.

237
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:02,855
Well, try us.

238
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,028
I was just put on trial
and sentenced to death.

239
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,013
What'd you do?

240
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,331
Held up a liquor store.

241
00:11:11,398 --> 00:11:14,183
I killed the owner
and his wife.

242
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:15,401
I wasn't thinking.
I was young.

243
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:16,786
Young?
When was this?

244
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,004
1981.

245
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:20,123
And they <i>just</i> put you
on trial?

246
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:21,507
No, no,
I just got out of prison.

247
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:24,243
Okay, you're making less sense
the more you talk.

248
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:27,079
No, it's okay.
Just...Go on.

249
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:29,132
Did 30 years.

250
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:30,967
I just got paroled.

251
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:32,802
Not that you're ever free
of that.

252
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,637
I think about it every day.

253
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,973
So, then, what were you
running from?

254
00:11:37,057 --> 00:11:39,642
Well, I told you --
the trial!

255
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:41,644
All I know is,
one minute I'm at the bar,

256
00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:43,029
and the next,
I get jumped,

257
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:44,814
wake up in
a damn courtroom.

258
00:11:44,898 --> 00:11:47,933
Courtroom?
Like a...Courtroom?

259
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:49,535
Well, no.
There was a judge.

260
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:51,621
Everything was crazy.

261
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:52,655
It was in a barn.

262
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,906
- At the apple farm?
- Yeah.

263
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:58,127
And this bar
where you were grabbed?

264
00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:00,330
Neal's Tavern.

265
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:04,133
Same place Matthew Hammond went
before his...

266
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:05,284
Car accident.

267
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:06,719
Think maybe dog guy
went there, too?

268
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:09,989
Is there anything else
you can tell us?

269
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:11,924
You believe me?

270
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:13,292
Who the hell <i>are</i> you?

271
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:15,762
We kind of...
specialize in crazy.

272
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:17,814
So, uh, this judge --
he got a name?

273
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:19,265
No.

274
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:20,933
But there was
these weird symbols.

275
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:23,353
Symbols?
Do you remember any of 'em?

276
00:12:23,437 --> 00:12:25,772
Can you draw them?

277
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:30,943
Excuse us a sec.

278
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:33,246
Can I talk to you?

279
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:42,171
What is it?

280
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:43,539
"What is it?"

281
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:45,091
Sam

282
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:47,176
How about a drunk driver,
Michael Vick, a murderer?

283
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:48,544
And?

284
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:49,846
<i>And...</i>

285
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,764
When did our black-and-white
case turn to mud?

286
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:53,338
I'm just saying I'm having
a hard time not rooting

287
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:54,563
for the ghosts on this one.

288
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:56,686
No, you said it yourself --
it's not on us to judge.

289
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,023
Yeah, except that
that's complete crap.

290
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:01,474
Everybody judges
all day long.

291
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:03,693
Look, I'm just supposed to
ignore what that guy did?

292
00:13:03,777 --> 00:13:05,361
We've shot people, Dean --
more than two.

293
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,890
Yeah, you know what?
When those ghosts come

294
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:08,754
to kick my ass, they've got
a compelling case.

295
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,700
So, what, you're saying --
what?

296
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:13,018
You don't want to work
the job anymore?

297
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,370
I'm just saying,
you know,

298
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:16,021
one simple
friggin' day on the job --

299
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:17,874
is that too much to ask?

300
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,076
Well, look.

301
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,712
I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna go
try and find that barn.

302
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:24,714
- You coming?
- I'm gonna check the bar.

303
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:27,583
To work or drink?

304
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:29,052
I haven't decided.

305
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:45,184
What's going on?
Where'd he go?

306
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:47,236
He...
Everything's fine.

307
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:48,938
Look, let's go back
to that farm.

308
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:50,740
Oh, no, no.
No, I'm not going back.

309
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:52,075
Warren, I need your help
finding that barn.

310
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,326
It's red --
it stands out.

311
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:55,244
I'm not going back.
They're out there.

312
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:56,510
Who?

313
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,735
The people I killed.

314
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,249
I just -- no.
No!

315
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:02,785
You're safer with me
than not.

316
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:06,923
No.

317
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:08,908
Okay.

318
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,259
Fine.

319
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:16,349
I need you to stay
inside this circle

320
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,101
until I get back,
okay?

321
00:14:18,185 --> 00:14:19,919
- It'll protect you.
- How?

322
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,104
Just trust me, okay?
I'm trying to help.

323
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:30,947
Stay put.

324
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,567
Bobby? Hey. Me.

325
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:38,704
Listen -- I'm sending you
some symbols to look up.

326
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,133
No. Excuse <i>me.</i>

327
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:51,968
Ah.

328
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:54,053
Dive sweet dive.

329
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,807
Hey.

330
00:14:57,891 --> 00:15:00,209
Well, now I know why
everybody comes here.

331
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:02,178
What can I get ya?

332
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:04,814
Scotch and soda.

333
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:06,232
You know, hold the soda.
Make it a double.

334
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:11,136
So, you --
you work the night shift?

335
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:13,138
Why?

336
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,574
You plan on making this
a regular thing?

337
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:17,610
No, I just got
a few questions.

338
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:19,278
Believe it or not
I'm a cop.

339
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:23,366
I believe it.

340
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:25,017
You look like
you've seen some crap.

341
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:27,587
I'm sorry,
I was off all week,

342
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:28,671
but Frank'll be back
tomorrow.

343
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:31,156
Right. Eh...

344
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:34,794
I'll do another.

345
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:36,662
Love life or job?

346
00:15:36,713 --> 00:15:38,347
Two quick doubles,
it's something.

347
00:15:38,432 --> 00:15:40,666
I'm Mia, by the way.

348
00:15:40,717 --> 00:15:44,837
Well, Mia,
that is a complex question.

349
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:46,439
I'm Dean, by the way.

350
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:49,108
Well, Dean, luckily
I'm like a captive shrink

351
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:50,560
with unlimited alcohol.

352
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:52,612
So, shoot.

353
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:55,565
You like to hear
people's problems, do ya?

354
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,366
I get curious.

355
00:15:58,518 --> 00:15:59,402
On occasion.

356
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:04,991
Work thing.

357
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:06,459
Since you asked.

358
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:09,862
You ever...

359
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:12,632
You ever do something
behind someone's back

360
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:13,916
because you had to?

361
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:15,918
Now you feel bad?

362
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:19,255
Well, Dean, if you had to,
why feel guilty?

363
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:22,892
That doesn't make
any sense.

364
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:30,016
Well, you know, we don't have
enough room for the worms

365
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:31,150
if we pop that can,
sister.

366
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:35,938
You may want to slow
your roll there.

367
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:37,607
The more I drink,
the better I tip.

368
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:39,558
Yeah, well,
I'm off in an hour.

369
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,743
So don't pass out on me.

370
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:42,945
Well, then I think
I'll switch to beer.

371
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,081
Good choice.

372
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:51,764
Hey, Bobby,
what do ya got?

373
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:54,350
Those chicken scratches --
definitely Egyptian.

374
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:55,401
"Book of the Dead."

375
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:58,404
So, good news, then.

376
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:00,606
They identify
the God Osiris.

377
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:02,358
Real authoritarian type.

378
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:03,826
He gets ahold of you,

379
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,978
he's judge, jury,
and executioner.

380
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:09,999
Lore says that he can see
directly into the human heart.

381
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,984
He weighs the guilt.

382
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:13,652
If he finds more than
a feather's worth --

383
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:14,870
boom, you're done.

384
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:17,340
So what's he doing
in Dearborn?

385
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:19,125
Well, it seems like
he just pops up

386
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:21,877
and does his circuit-judge act
and then disappears again.

387
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:23,279
That's all I got so far.

388
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:25,097
You know
what <i>this</i> means.

389
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:27,466
Yeah. We've got to find him before
he goes underground again.

390
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:28,768
No, you idjit.

391
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:31,520
It means you two got to
get the hell out of Dodge.

392
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:35,141
This guy hones in on people
who feel guilty.

393
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:36,642
Who does that
sound like to you?

394
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,782
It's been a while.
But you owe yourself.

395
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:44,567
It's nothing
but a ground ball --

396
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:47,119
you just got to put
your mitt down.

397
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:50,122
You are Dean Winchester.

398
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,357
This is what you do.

399
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:07,111
Dude, third message.

400
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,580
You better not be loaded.

401
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:10,966
Call me.
This is important.

402
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:13,885
Dean.
About time, man. I --

403
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,720
Uh, hello?
Who is this?

404
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:16,805
Oh, well, I just --

405
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,173
I picked this
off the ground,

406
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,958
where I've been standing
for 10 minutes

407
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,793
listening to it ring.

408
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:23,127
Is this Dean's phone?

409
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:24,145
Yeah.

410
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,847
Well...

411
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,816
He was supposed
to meet me here.

412
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,267
Where are you?
I can be right there.

413
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,167
Sam?

414
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,190
No. Please.

415
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,892
I'm sorry.

416
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,677
Please.

417
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:14,178
You did it to us.

418
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,901
Well, I hope he's okay.

419
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,288
Now, where exactly
did you find this phone?

420
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,574
Uh...There.

421
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,043
Thanks.

422
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,238
Really, Warren? All you noticed
were the symbols?

423
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,211
Quit squirming,
Mr. Winchester.

424
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:21,463
They're Houdini-proof.

425
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:25,683
Now, you want to talk
charges or...

426
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,469
I'd rather talk about
your Bukowski schtick

427
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:28,920
at the bar.

428
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:30,588
What, you can't jump a guy
when he's sober?!

429
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:32,807
You and that waitress
had quite a talk, huh?

430
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:36,694
Get a couple drinks in you,
and the guilt comes pouring out.

431
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,930
Oh, eavespropping --
that's cute.

432
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,365
Speaking of...

433
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,201
You're gonna skulk
all night, Sam?

434
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:47,655
Sam?

435
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,709
Nice job finding us.

436
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,912
I assume you figured out
who I am, too?

437
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:55,463
Yeah.

438
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,448
You want to fill me in?

439
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,452
Osiris.

440
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:03,388
He's an Egyptian God.

441
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,257
Ta-da!

442
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:08,343
Now, go about
your business, Sammy.

443
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,795
Look, if anyone should be
on trial, it's me.

444
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:12,263
That's for me to decide.

445
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:13,932
Now go away.

446
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:16,434
But h-he has the right
to an attorney...

447
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:17,635
Doesn't he?
Huh.

448
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:19,521
Let me defend him.
Well, that's unusual.

449
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,673
Are you gonna respect
his rights or not?

450
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,343
Why not?

451
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:30,815
Uh, Sam?
You're not a lawyer.

452
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:31,983
I was pre-law.

453
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,201
Yeah, <i>pre.</i>

454
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,870
All right, then.
Let's get started.

455
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:39,924
Now, the list of witnesses
I can call --

456
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,793
- endless.
- Objection!

457
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:43,461
Are you gonna let me finish
my sentence, Sam?

458
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:45,763
No.
This isn't fair.

459
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,348
"Fair"?

460
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,333
I'm sorry.

461
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:50,501
Moving on.

462
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,388
I can make it very simple.

463
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,674
Three witnesses.

464
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:58,309
- Objection!
- Grounds?

465
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,612
Witness is being called
without prior notice.

466
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,681
Good one.
I saw that on "The Good Wife."

467
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,450
Yes.
Very fine objection.

468
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,451
Denied!

469
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,485
What? Why?!

470
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:09,537
Because I'm the judge, son.

471
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:13,158
Now stop objecting,

472
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:15,627
or I'll find you
in contempt --

473
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,196
that is, kill you.

474
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:22,300
So I advise you
to let me move it along.

475
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,889
The prosecution calls

476
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,925
Joanna Beth Harvelle
to the stand.

477
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,197
Jo?

478
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,516
Dean. Sam.

479
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:39,817
Long time.

480
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:46,824
State your name
for the court.

481
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,326
Jo Harvelle.

482
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:53,264
And what is your relationship
to Dean Winchester?

483
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,084
We worked together.

484
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:06,878
Isn't it true
that you admired him?

485
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:10,882
Well, as a hunter...
Yeah.

486
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:14,085
As a guy,
he was kind of a jerk.

487
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:18,139
So you saw him as a mentor
of sorts?

488
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,440
I wouldn't put it
like that.

489
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:20,742
How would you put it?

490
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:23,928
I don't know.

491
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:25,930
I trusted him.

492
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:27,699
So if you're trying to say

493
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:28,616
that he was a bad guy
or something --

494
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:29,617
Was it hard?

495
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:30,768
What?

496
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:34,072
Working with him...

497
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:35,623
Considering your feelings.

498
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,091
No. What feelings?

499
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:38,743
You would have done
quite a bit for him --

500
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:41,879
followed him
into any battle.

501
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,131
I know what you're getting at,
and it's bull.

502
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,851
So Dean had nothing to do
with your first case,

503
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,720
the one that started
it all.

504
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:00,682
It wasn't like that.

505
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,434
No feelings.
None at all.

506
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:08,489
You would have chosen
the same exact road.

507
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,611
Ended up
in that hardware store,

508
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:15,413
holding the fuse.

509
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,149
Oh, you're a piece of work.
You know that?

510
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,667
Putting words in her mouth --

511
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,870
Keep him under control,
counsel...

512
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,005
or I'll remove his tongue.

513
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,043
Your witness.

514
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,501
Jo.

515
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,358
So...

516
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:46,227
Your dad...
Was in the life?

517
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,979
Yes, he was.

518
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,348
And your relationship
with him?

519
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:51,399
Good.

520
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,516
I mean...

521
00:25:52,568 --> 00:25:54,402
You idolized him.

522
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,370
Basically.

523
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:57,322
So why'd you start?

524
00:25:57,373 --> 00:25:59,190
To impress some loudmouth ass
you just met...

525
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:02,327
Or 'cause you wanted to be
like your dad?

526
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:04,746
Daddy issues.

527
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,297
Definitely.

528
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,200
Listen, Dean, I don't --

529
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,387
All right.

530
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:17,425
You two can have a moment
to strategize.

531
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,113
And then I'll call
my next witness.

532
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:30,104
All right.
Who's the next witness?

533
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,407
He looked at you
like you'd know.

534
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,825
I got no clue.

535
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,993
This whole thing's
like a friggin' episode

536
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,061
of "Pee-Wee's Playhouse."

537
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,729
Next witness!

538
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:41,582
The prosecution calls...

539
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,103
Sam Winchester to the stand.

540
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:48,840
Sam...

541
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:53,127
Not exactly the life
you expected, is it?

542
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,962
Details a little different.

543
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,432
For a while there,
you were gonna be a real lawyer.

544
00:26:57,499 --> 00:26:58,683
Marry Jess.

545
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,968
Yeah, that was
a long time ago.

546
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:05,056
But were you or were you not
happily out of the family racket

547
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:08,526
until Dean showed back up
in that gas guzzler?

548
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,478
Ah-ah.
The truth, now.

549
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,672
It's complicated.

550
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,160
That one act
had quite a domino effect.

551
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,779
Come back,

552
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:29,831
your girl's dead.

553
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,299
Well,
that wasn't his fault.

554
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,385
Sure, and neither is everything
that came after --

555
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:37,054
all the death and the blood
and hanging on by a thread.

556
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,956
None of that is on Dean,
directly.

557
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,998
But don't you think

558
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,816
that your brother
dragged you

559
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:07,452
back into
that catastrophic mess

560
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:09,821
because he'd rather damn you
with him than be alone?

561
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,047
No.

562
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,549
One way or another,
I'd have gotten pulled back in.

563
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,267
- You know that for certain?
- Pretty sure.

564
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,936
- "Pretty sure."
- I'm positive.

565
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,188
I believe you.

566
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,690
Hey, if it was about convincing
me [chuckling] I would say...

567
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:30,841
What?

568
00:28:30,893 --> 00:28:36,097
I don't decide
anything, Sam.

569
00:28:36,165 --> 00:28:38,282
I don't decide
Dean's guilt.

570
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,118
I just weigh the guilt
that's already there.

571
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:46,374
This is solely about
how Dean feels,

572
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,376
way down deep.

573
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,713
Them's the breaks.

574
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:59,086
So, if Dean believes
he's innocent, then he is?

575
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:00,671
"If."

576
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:03,224
A big "if."

577
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,209
Why do I bring up the past?

578
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,564
To see if he feels like
dog food about it.

579
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:12,316
People want to be judged.

580
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,151
They <i>really</i> do.

581
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,887
When your heart's heavy,
let me tell you,

582
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:18,940
real punishment's a mercy.

583
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:21,526
I want to call Dean
to the stand.

584
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:23,528
Oh, you do, now?

585
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:25,263
There is an order to this stuff,
you know.

586
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,616
Okay. I'll allow it.

587
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:42,930
So, Dean...

588
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,432
When you came and got me,

589
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,967
did you know Jess
would die?

590
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,385
Or any of it?

591
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:48,803
'Course not.
Right.

592
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,471
How <i>could</i> you?
I mean, are you psychic?

593
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:54,825
That's a question.

594
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,760
No.

595
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,113
- Uh, definitely not psychic.
- Great.

596
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,531
So why would you
feel guilty

597
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,699
about <i>not</i> predicting
the future?

598
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,868
Yeah, I guess
that doesn't make any sense.

599
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,487
Actually,
yeah, no, I <i>don't.</i>

600
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,406
What about Jo?

601
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:09,874
Did you
actually kill her?

602
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:12,927
Uh, no.

603
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:15,613
Isn't it true that you don't
feel guilty about her --

604
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:18,165
that you're just...sad
she's dead?

605
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,218
That it just...blows?

606
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,971
Actually...

607
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,640
Maybe, yeah.

608
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:28,843
Mm-mm-mm.

609
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,795
I like your style, Sam.

610
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:32,897
Very engaging.

611
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,016
Dean

612
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,970
Does any of this feel
like it's really...on you?

613
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,190
Not really.

614
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,343
Then is your heart heavy
with guilt

615
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,362
or just plain heavy
and none of this guy's business?

616
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:52,617
Uh, what you said --
the second thing.

617
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:55,252
Then I rest my case.

618
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,371
Very good...
Both of you.

619
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,206
All right.

620
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,258
Because I really
enjoyed that,

621
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,928
I'm gonna be generous
and ask --

622
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,847
Dean, do you want me to call
my last witness?

623
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:11,686
I know you didn't want
to let her go,

624
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,603
but it was the right thing
to do.

625
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,339
No problem.

626
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,109
Or have we had enough?

627
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,615
What the hell's
he talking about?

628
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,651
Enough Ally McBealing.
Just drop the hammer, will ya?

629
00:31:26,702 --> 00:31:28,152
Wait, Dean,
he's giving us more time!

630
00:31:28,203 --> 00:31:29,186
It's not gonna make
a difference, Sam!

631
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:31,372
You need another moment?
You done?

632
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:45,886
The court's reached a verdict.

633
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:50,725
I find you, Dean Winchester,

634
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,143
guilty in your heart...

635
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,597
and sentence you to die.

636
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,883
I'd suggest you get
your affairs in order quickly.

637
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:35,104
Damn it, I told him.

638
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:37,523
Osiris would have
got to him one way or another.

639
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:39,408
Guy's batting a thousand.

640
00:32:39,492 --> 00:32:42,661
There's still time.
We can figure something out.

641
00:32:58,044 --> 00:32:59,011
Bobby.

642
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:00,412
What do you got?

643
00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:02,097
A way to give Osiris
a dirt nap.

644
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:04,583
Good.
We need it.

645
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:06,001
Now,
as near as I can figure,

646
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:07,152
it ought to put him down

647
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,470
for a couple of centuries,
at least.

648
00:33:08,538 --> 00:33:11,089
It's worked a few times
since the Pharaohs were big.

649
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:12,174
So it's temporary?

650
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:13,609
<i>Long</i> temporary.

651
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:16,278
I say we slap
that band-aid on

652
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:18,096
and leave finding a cure to
some hunter in a space suit.

653
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:21,817
Now, you're gonna need to
stab him with a Ram's horn.

654
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:23,235
A Ram's horn?

655
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,770
Where am I gonna find
a Ram's horn in Dearborn?

656
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:26,271
No clue.

657
00:33:26,322 --> 00:33:27,939
But make sure
it's a sharp piece.

658
00:33:27,991 --> 00:33:29,875
He ain't gonna let you
stab him twice.

659
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:30,609
Yeah.
Thanks.

660
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,779
Ram's horn.

661
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,048
Okay.

662
00:33:38,968 --> 00:33:40,919
Huh.

663
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,921
Apparently, Jewish people
blow through them once a year.

664
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:45,841
Where you gonna find one
this time of night?

665
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:46,958
Uh...

666
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,427
Synagogue?

667
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:49,978
You're gonna steal
from a Temple?

668
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:51,346
Well, that's a new low.

669
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:52,598
You're on death row, Dean.

670
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:53,799
Quit joking around.

671
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,551
Here. Keys.
I'll be back.

672
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:57,936
The dick's gonna sic Jo
after me, Sam.

673
00:33:57,987 --> 00:33:59,071
You're a hunter, Dean.

674
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,489
You know how to deal
with ghosts.

675
00:34:04,944 --> 00:34:06,495
So, you suggesting
I kill her again?

676
00:34:08,665 --> 00:34:11,667
You didn't kill her, Dean.

677
00:34:11,751 --> 00:34:12,618
I'll hurry.

678
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:31,270
You can come out now.

679
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:01,667
I'm guessing you're not here
for bar mitzvah lessons.

680
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:17,316
You know
I'd never do this.

681
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:18,767
I know.

682
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:23,272
I guess it's his thing.

683
00:35:23,356 --> 00:35:25,858
Some kind of twisted
eye for an eye.

684
00:35:27,744 --> 00:35:29,528
It's okay.

685
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:30,362
No, it's not.

686
00:35:31,948 --> 00:35:33,782
You deserve better.

687
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:35,834
No, <i>you</i> did.

688
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:38,170
<i>You</i> deserved better, Jo.

689
00:35:50,517 --> 00:35:53,152
Dean, my life was good.

690
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,419
Really.

691
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,940
He was right, you know --

692
00:35:58,024 --> 00:36:00,025
that dick judge,
about me.

693
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:01,360
No, he wasn't.

694
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:03,111
You were a kid.

695
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:04,146
Not true.

696
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,265
You <i>and</i> Sam.

697
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:10,586
I just -- you know,

698
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:12,120
hunters are never kids.

699
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:13,322
I never was.

700
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:15,774
I didn't even stop
to think about it.

701
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:17,943
It's not your fault.
It wasn't on you.

702
00:36:17,994 --> 00:36:19,311
No, but I didn't
want to do it alone.

703
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,831
Who does?

704
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:24,850
No, the right thing

705
00:36:24,918 --> 00:36:26,385
would have been to send
your ass back home to your mom.

706
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:27,886
Like to have seen you try.

707
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,008
He <i>was</i> right
about one thing.

708
00:36:33,092 --> 00:36:35,310
What,
your massive crush on me?

709
00:36:35,395 --> 00:36:36,762
Shut up.

710
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,652
You carry all kinds of crap
you don't have to, Dean.

711
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:49,658
It kind of gets clearer
when you're dead.

712
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:54,112
Well, in that case,

713
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:58,617
you should be able to see
that I am 90%...crap.

714
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:04,823
I get rid of that,
what then?

715
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,508
You really want to die
not knowing?

716
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,231
Dean.

717
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:14,516
Yeah.

718
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:15,968
It's time.

719
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,586
Come on, Dean.

720
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:54,556
I used to hunt ghosts.
I know the tricks.

721
00:38:11,891 --> 00:38:13,241
He's making me do this.

722
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:15,327
It's okay.

723
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,915
Jo?

724
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:20,370
So, it seem like...
You know, like...

725
00:39:20,422 --> 00:39:22,706
She was in pain?

726
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:23,974
No.

727
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:27,561
No, just kind of faded.
Regular Jo.

728
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:30,181
Actually,
maybe a little happier.

729
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:36,403
I got a question.

730
00:39:36,471 --> 00:39:38,489
So where the hell
did that come from,

731
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:40,691
volunteering to defend me?

732
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:42,710
He was gonna kick me out.

733
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:44,695
I don't know, man --
in another life,

734
00:39:44,746 --> 00:39:46,914
you might have made
a pretty decent scuzzbag.

735
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:49,366
I'm 0 for 1, Dean.

736
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:51,085
Ah, it's not your fault.

737
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:53,120
You were
pretty convincing.

738
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:55,840
So, who was he
talking about?

739
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:57,424
Who?

740
00:39:57,509 --> 00:39:59,126
That whole
final-witness thing.

741
00:39:59,211 --> 00:40:02,129
No idea.

742
00:40:02,214 --> 00:40:05,633
Honestly, that could be just
about anybody dead we know.

743
00:40:08,803 --> 00:40:11,856
By the way...

744
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:13,691
I mean, I get why Judge Judy
put me on trial --

745
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:16,110
I got guilt coming out
of my pores.

746
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:19,196
But...why'd he skip you?

747
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,450
I think I just don't...
feel guilty anymore.

748
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:26,398
Come on.

749
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:27,631
Look, I don't know
what to tell you, Dean.

750
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:30,040
I mean, I've spent a lot of time
feeling pretty crappy --

751
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:31,292
like, my whole life.

752
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:32,793
What, you got a secret stash
of happy pills?

753
00:40:35,914 --> 00:40:36,931
Hell.

754
00:40:36,998 --> 00:40:39,250
Look, I'm not saying
it's logical.

755
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:42,553
I just...you know, I feel like
I did a lot of stuff

756
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,505
I should have felt
bad for,

757
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:46,557
and then I paid a lot
of dues

758
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:47,975
and came out the other side,
you know?

759
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:49,310
And that worked?

760
00:40:49,394 --> 00:40:50,978
I mean, you really feel like
your slate's wiped?

761
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:52,563
No.

762
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,481
Nothing ever gets wiped.
You know?

763
00:40:54,566 --> 00:40:57,234
Sometimes I see Lucifer
when I friggin' brush my teeth,

764
00:40:57,302 --> 00:40:59,987
but, I don't know, I guess
I just finally feel like

765
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:01,739
my past is my past,

766
00:41:01,806 --> 00:41:03,574
and I can move on
with my life.

767
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:05,442
You know, hopefully.

768
00:41:05,493 --> 00:41:07,411
Easier said than done.

769
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:08,562
Not arguing that.

770
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,985
Well, I don't know
whether to be jealous

771
00:41:15,053 --> 00:41:16,870
or weirded out.

772
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:19,673
You'll get used to it.

773
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:21,675
I mean,
I don't want to sound lame,

774
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,961
but...I kind of
feel good, Dean.

775
00:41:27,515 --> 00:41:30,801
Well, you are going to be
a pleasure to ride with.

776
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:42,323
