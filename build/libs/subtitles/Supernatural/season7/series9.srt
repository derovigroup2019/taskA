1
00:00:01,354 --> 00:00:02,553
You can't stop any of us.

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:05,563
We can't be killed,
you stupid little chewtoys.

3
00:00:08,294 --> 00:00:09,733
These things are smarter
than you.

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:11,682
You don't have a clue
how to kill 'em

5
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:13,820
or slow 'em down, and
your plan is what,

6
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:15,288
go right at 'em?

7
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:17,256
We've been
a little busy.

8
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:19,458
Hunting Leviathan.

9
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:20,959
You met dick yet?

10
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:23,361
I'd sooner swim through
hot garbage than shake hands

11
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:24,696
with a bottom-feeding
mutation like you.

12
00:00:24,763 --> 00:00:26,230
I'd never work with you,
Crowley.

13
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:28,465
I hate the bastard.
Squash 'em all.

14
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,092
You need to see a fella
named Frank Devereaux.

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,353
Bobby Singer sent us.

16
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:35,368
Or not. Who?

17
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,769
We just need you to get us
further off the grid,

18
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,466
but keep us
on the board.

19
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:41,530
Wipe all your old aliases.

20
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:44,125
Change your phones
on a very frequent

21
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:46,147
non-schedule schedule,
you understand?

22
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,361
You can't just
look me in the face

23
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:48,637
and tell me you're fine.

24
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:50,013
- You want me to be honest?
- Yeah.

25
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,362
I don't like lying to you.

26
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,838
You know,
it doesn't feel right.

27
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:54,921
So, yeah, you got me there.
I been climbing walls.

28
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,196
I know how that is.

29
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:38,696
Good night, sweetie.

30
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:49,472
<i>This is Nature Sounds'</i>

31
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:54,557
<i>"Sounds of Nature,"</i>
<i>Volume 4, "Soothing Seas."</i>

32
00:02:16,254 --> 00:02:19,028

33
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:25,445
Leanne!

34
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:36,607
Stay away.

37
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:01,888
Did you strip enough wire?

38
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,192
Yes, I stripped
enough wire.

39
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:07,301
All right.

40
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:21,016
See? Told you.

41
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,760
Well, isn't this cozy?

42
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,064
Yeah.

43
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:34,544
Well, Motel 6 just ain't
leaving the light on anymore.

44
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:35,814
Well, I'm taking page

45
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,885
out of Frank Devereaux's Bible
on this.

46
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:39,521
Everybody's out
to get you --

47
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:41,292
paranoia is just
plain common sense.

48
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:44,531
Weeks, guys. Weeks.

49
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,134
We've been living
with cold showers,

50
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,172
cold Hot Pockets,
cold freaking everything.

51
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,142
I mean, this is the bottom
that we're living in.

52
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,411
You guys get that, right?

53
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,482
How many big mouths
are out there,

54
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,319
running card traces,
like Chet,

55
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:58,091
or hunting us down
God knows what ways?

56
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,443
No, now's not the time

57
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:01,862
to be laying our bed rolls out
on the grid.

58
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:03,113
Not if we can help it.

59
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,952
That's just great.

60
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:13,707
This is stupid.

61
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:16,075
Our quality of life
is crap.

62
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:20,096
We got Purgatory's
least wanted everywhere,

63
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:23,767
and we're on our third
"The World's Screwed" issue

64
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:25,302
in, what, three years?

65
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,754
We've steered the bus away
from the cliff twice already.

66
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:29,189
Someone's got to do it.

67
00:04:29,256 --> 00:04:30,924
What if the bus
<i>wants</i> to go over the cliff?

68
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:32,442
You think the world
wants to end?

69
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:34,327
I think that
if we didn't take its belt

70
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:35,862
and all its pens away
each year

71
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,380
that, yeah,
the whole enchilada

72
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:38,949
would have offed
itself already.

73
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,901
Stop trying to wrestle
with the big picture, son.

74
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:41,952
You're gonna hurt your head.

75
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,122
So, what's the guff?

76
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:50,293
Well, uh, there have been
a rash of sightings

77
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:52,278
all over the southern
pine barrens --

78
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,581
a strange, fast-moving,
human-like creature.

79
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,216
Locals even have
a name for it.

80
00:04:56,283 --> 00:04:58,468
The Jersey Devil?

81
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:00,620
I thought that was just
local tall-tale crap.

82
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:03,139
The area's history
of sightings

83
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:04,424
goes back
more than two centuries.

84
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:07,894
Some accounts gave it bat wings,
others horns,

85
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:09,846
a...a tail.

86
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:13,299
And, uh, oh, yeah,
a horse's head.

87
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:17,854
The sketch looks more like
a Chewbacca head.

88
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:19,773
Sounds kind of mixed-up.

89
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:22,025
Yeah, kind of like it should be
fighting a Japanese robot.

90
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:23,360
Well, mixed-up or not,

91
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:25,946
it sounds like it might
just have a body count.

92
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:32,082
"Camping high season
harshed by human burrito"?

93
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:32,919
Yeah.

94
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,838
Something hung a camper
up in a tree,

95
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:37,707
then ate him alive right
through his sleeping bag.

96
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:40,293
His wife
hasn't been seen, either.

97
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:42,712
Plus, there have been
four other missing persons

98
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:44,180
reported in
the last three weeks.

99
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:47,217
State troopers -- get this --
are saying it's a rogue bear.

100
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:48,501
Yeah, of course,
when was the last time

101
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:51,221
you saw a bear string up
its own pi?ata?

102
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:52,656
<i>Something's</i> out there
in the woods.

103
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:56,192
Hey, we're going honest to
goodness wilderness hunting.

104
00:05:56,277 --> 00:05:57,961
I haven't used my .30-30
in a while.

105
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:59,296
Okay, Davey Crockett,

106
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:01,681
well, safari's gonna have
to wait till tomorrow

107
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:03,483
and after
our suit-and-tie dance.

108
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:06,453
We'll make sure this is not just
some backwoods crackhead

109
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,688
who likes to roll glampers.

110
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:10,407
What the hell's
a glamper?

111
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:11,625
Sam?

112
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,880
High-end camper.
TV, A.C., Wi-Fi.

113
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:19,466
Back to nature,
zero inconvenience.

114
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:20,634
That's idiotic.

115
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:22,035
Yeah.

116
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:24,321
Some people just don't
know how to live.

117
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:33,763
So, Ranger Evans --

118
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:36,016
oh, uh,
you can call me Rick.

119
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,050
Ranger Rick.

120
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:42,689
Uh, you were the one who found
Mitchell Rayburn, correct?

121
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,609
The human burrito.

122
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:49,446
State police have it down
as a bear attack.

123
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,234
Yeah, I read
what the state police says.

124
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:57,120
That was no rogue brown.

125
00:06:57,188 --> 00:06:59,756
Apparently, some others
reported seeing something

126
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,908
a little,
you know, weirder.

127
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,544
You know,
I've been a ranger for 12 years.

128
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:05,912
Tell you the truth,

129
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:10,016
we have no idea
what's out there.

130
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:14,437
Big.
Lot of trees and whatnot.

131
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:16,255
Tell you this, though.

132
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:18,642
You got to respect
mother nature.

133
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:21,478
You respect her,
or she's gonna string you up,

134
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:24,698
and she'll eat your ass
right through the Gore-Tex.

135
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:27,484
So you're thinking
it's mother nature?

136
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:30,870
See, me and Phil,
we've been finding, uh,

137
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:33,490
<i>something's</i> leftovers
for weeks --

138
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:36,776
deer remains, badger,

139
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:38,277
missing pets.

140
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,629
Who's Phil?

141
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:43,116
<i>Assistant</i> Chief Ranger.

142
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,552
Come to think of it,

143
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:47,453
I haven't seen Phil
in a couple of days.

144
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:49,889
He's supposed to call

145
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:52,142
from whatever station
he's checking off.

146
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:53,510
But you think maybe

147
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:56,479
your assistant chief ranger
might be missing?

148
00:07:56,564 --> 00:07:59,566
I should probably
report that.

149
00:08:02,186 --> 00:08:03,353
Oh. Excuse us.

150
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:06,439
Well, you, uh...

151
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,825
Enjoy your lunch...

152
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:11,027
Ranger Rick.

153
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,667
So?

154
00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:20,587
Well, I took a look
at the cadaver --

155
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:22,038
what's left of it.

156
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:23,656
Not a happy camper.

157
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,493
Don't have any stats
on a Jersey Devil,

158
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:30,380
but the bite radius
on the vic's wounds --

159
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:32,599
it's too small
for a Leviathan.

160
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,668
And he's still got a ventricle
and some change,

161
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:38,388
so I doubt
we're talking werewolf.

162
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:40,507
And a wendigo
don't leave no scraps.

163
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:42,976
Hmm. Lunch?

164
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:44,010
Starving.

165
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:46,146
Hey! Uh, Brandon.

166
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:47,647
We grab a booth?

167
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:51,350
Hey, uh, douchewad,
a hostess will seat you.

168
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:53,369
Do I look like
a freaking hostess?

169
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:56,956
Do you <i>want</i>
<i>to look like a hostess?</i>

170
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:02,746
That didn't really make sense,
what you...said.

171
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,165
What was that?

172
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:08,668
I sure hope we don't get
Brandon's section.

173
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:11,304
Sidewinder soup and salad combo
goes to big bird.

174
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:15,008
TDK slammer to Ken Doll.

175
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:17,761
And a little heart-smart
for creepy uncle.

176
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:20,180
What is your problem?

177
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:21,865
You are my problem!

178
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,720
Oh, Brandon's got <i>his</i> flare
all up in a bunch.

179
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:30,740
Yeah.
There goes <i>his</i> 18%.

180
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:32,108
Anyway,
the chief ranger --

181
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:34,244
I don't think he believes
in the Jersey Devil.

182
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:38,998
Oh, by the way, did he seem
a little, uh, stoned to you?

183
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:40,834
Ranger Rick? Yeah.

184
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:43,336
Definitely growing his own
on the back 40

185
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:45,789
and smoking
all the profits.

186
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:49,626
He did seem to think
that there was something --

187
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,178
Oh,
that is good sandwich.

188
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:53,429
What the hell
did you get?

189
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:56,883
New pepperjack
Turducken Slammer --

190
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:59,719
limited time only.

191
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,305
Bunch of birds shoved up
inside each other.

192
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,057
Shouldn't play God
like that.

193
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:05,558
Hey, don't look at me sideways
from that --

194
00:10:05,609 --> 00:10:07,010
that Chinese chicken geezer
salad there, okay?

195
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,761
This is awesome.

196
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:11,931
Like the perfect storm of
your top-three edible birds.

197
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,737
All right, anyways, um...

198
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:19,289
The ranger did seem to think

199
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:21,374
there was something
out in Wharton Forest.

200
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:22,909
Well, then I'd say
it's safari time.

201
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,411
Look at her!
You're telling me she's not fat?

202
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:27,831
No, no. Up <i>yours,</i> Mike.

203
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:29,382
Shove it right up yours!

204
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:36,455
Well, anyway, back to bigger
and better things.

205
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:12,658
Couple of bucks.

206
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,211
Head-butting
over turf probably.

207
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:17,430
Pretty sure
the other fella won.

208
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:28,224
I guess I forgot.

209
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:33,029
Before you were a hunter,
you were actually a...hunter.

210
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:36,349
Yeah, well, we shot our dinner
when I was a kid.

211
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,684
You used to take us hunting.
Remember?

212
00:11:38,736 --> 00:11:40,703
Dad had a case,
he'd just dump us on you.

213
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:42,322
Shoot,
you must have taught us

214
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:44,207
most of the outdoor tracking
we know.

215
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,377
Yeah, what I could get
to stick.

216
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:48,912
I never could get
you little grubs

217
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:50,463
to pull a trigger
on a single deer.

218
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,248
Talking about Bambi,
man.

219
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,250
You don't shoot Bambi,
jackass.

220
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,036
You shoot Bambi's mother.

221
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:09,899
Well,
looks like we found Phil.

222
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:19,025
Special agents.

223
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,245
Listen, I got your call.

224
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:25,031
But I'm not sure I got
what you were saying.

225
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:32,571
Hey.
I think we found Phil.

226
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:34,674
That's what I said.

227
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:36,909
Uh, I should probably
call this in.

228
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:42,081
Yeah, yeah.
Solid move, Rick.

229
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:55,895
Uh, this is Ranger Evans
up at Acher's Point. Come in.

230
00:12:57,982 --> 00:13:01,131
Uh, repeat.
This is <i>Chief</i> Ranger Evans.

231
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:03,899
I have a situation
out at Acher's Point.

232
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:06,835
Ranger,
I think we've got company.

233
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:08,337
Yeah? Who's that?

234
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:13,155
Ranger!

235
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,235
Ranger Evans!

236
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,951
Ranger!

237
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,926
It's got him
up in the trees.

238
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,348
- Lights off.
- What?

239
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:36,083
Wait, Bobby, you think
that's really a good idea?

240
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:38,686
Shut up, shut off,
and listen.

241
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:47,645
Damn thing is eating Rick.

242
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:48,813
Man, I liked Rick.

243
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:08,883
Wow.
Nice shot, Bobby.

244
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,267
Seriously.

245
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:12,452
We all got our gifts.

246
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:27,268
What about the rest
of Ranger Rick?

247
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,655
Ranger called in his 10-20.
His own will find him.

248
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,791
We got crap to do.

249
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,305
Built like a supermodel,
but the thing was strong.

250
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:50,374
That's for damn sure.

251
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,310
Carried a full-grown man
up a tree in nothing flat.

252
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:55,963
<i>But</i> it only took one bullet
to bring it down.

253
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:58,849
And not even a silver bullet,
just a bullet-bullet.

254
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:11,312
Whew!

255
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:14,198
First one
must have just stunned it.

256
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:21,155
All right, well, let's check
its hulk pants for some I.D.

257
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,029
Oh, that is just gonna
ruin the leather.

258
00:15:33,084 --> 00:15:34,084
Are you feeling okay?

259
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,636
Yeah, I feel great.

260
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Gerald Browder,

261
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:42,209
uh, lived here in town, 5'9",
brown hair and blue eyes...

262
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:44,044
235 pounds.

263
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,380
Whoa.

264
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,401
Well, apparently,
he's lost a little pudge.

265
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:56,774
Maybe it's a-a lap-band
side effect.

266
00:16:13,174 --> 00:16:16,710
What the hell?

267
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:21,098
I think we better have a look
under Gerald's hood.

268
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:25,519
God!

269
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,606
Its organs are swimming
in the stuff.

270
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,474
You guys getting hungry?

271
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:33,694
I'm hungry.

272
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:37,264
What's that?

273
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:39,733
His stomach.

274
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:40,985
For a guy on a diet,

275
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:43,120
Gerry here packed it in
pretty good.

276
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:44,822
That's human right there.

277
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:46,824
That's fresh Rick.

278
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:48,459
Let's see.

279
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:51,328
Plus...

280
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:53,380
Pine cone?

281
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:58,135
Pack of gum
in the wrapper.

282
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,257
That's -- that's older.

283
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:06,160
Maybe like a --
maybe Ranger Phil or the camper.

284
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:07,728
What's that?

285
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:09,196
Looks like a --

286
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:10,964
yeah, that's a --
that's a cat's head.

287
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:15,269
A glamper or two
is one thing,

288
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,021
but you got to be damn hungry
to eat a cat's head.

289
00:17:17,105 --> 00:17:19,639
Mm-hmm.

290
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:25,479
Well, lookit here.

291
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,749
I'm no Dr. Oz, but...

292
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:31,318
I think
that's his adrenal glands.

293
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:34,204
Okay. And?

294
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:36,840
Meant to be the size
of hotel bar soap...

295
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:38,792
And bright orange.

296
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:42,129
Ooh.

297
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,465
All right, that might help
explain the strength.

298
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:47,134
Um, but whatever this thing is,
it's not the Jersey Devil,

299
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:49,436
but it sure as hell
ain't Gerald Browder anymore.

300
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:51,671
Okay, guys, seriously.

301
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:54,942
It's time for dinner?

302
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,554
Gerald Browder, 35,
self-employed.

303
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:09,023
Air-conditioning
repairman.

304
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,341
Missing person
number three.

305
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:11,608
Disappeared
eight days ago.

306
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:13,327
Well, that explains
all the people

307
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:15,145
who got eaten
in the last eight days.

308
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:16,463
Yeah.

309
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:18,382
Question is,
what happened to <i>him?</i>

310
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:31,044
Dean.

311
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:33,680
Uh, so,
what do you think?

312
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:35,949
I'm not that worried
about it.

313
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:38,068
Excuse me?

314
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:40,904
That's funny, right?

315
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:43,440
I could give two shakes
of a rat's ass.

316
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,276
Is that right?

317
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:49,747
Do rats shake their ass,
or is it something else?

318
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,915
Eh.

319
00:19:15,473 --> 00:19:16,640
Give me that.

320
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:18,442
Whoa, whoa! Why?!

321
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:23,981
There's some funky chicken in
the TDK Slammer, ain't there?

322
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:25,432
Yeah.

323
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,653
This is stupid.

324
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:32,439
My sandwich
didn't do anything.

325
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,908
I don't know what you think
you're gonna find.

326
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,960
There's something wrong
with you, Dean.

327
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:40,297
Are you kidding?
I'm fine!

328
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:44,668
I --
I actually feel great.

329
00:19:46,504 --> 00:19:49,139
The best I've felt
in a couple months.

330
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:51,225
Cass? Black goo?

331
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:52,843
I don't even care anymore.

332
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:54,845
And you know
what's even better?

333
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,630
I don't care
that I don't care.

334
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:00,634
I just want
my damn slammer back.

335
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:03,570
Dude,
you are completely stoned,

336
00:20:03,638 --> 00:20:05,489
just like
Ranger Rick was.

337
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:08,108
Just like the dinner rush
back at Biggerson's.

338
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:10,661
And everybody's loving
the Turducken.

339
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:14,915
I think you pissed off
my sandwich.

340
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,422
That -- that's <i>in</i> me?

341
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,990
O-only half of it.

342
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:26,076
Does that snot
look familiar?

343
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:29,496
Okay, so whatever turned
Gerry Browder into a pumpkin head...

344
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:32,349
And is currently turning Dean
into an idiot --

345
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm right here.
Right here.

346
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:36,887
Is in the Turducken Slammer
at Biggerson's.

347
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:38,505
Yeah.
It's in the meat.

348
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:44,895
If I wasn't so chilled out
right now, I would puke.

349
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:55,989
How's he doing?

350
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:01,912
He's sleeping it off.

351
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,914
Tryptophan coma.

352
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,367
So,
you think he's okay?

353
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:08,835
Yeah, he's all right.

354
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:10,387
Good.

355
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:12,205
So you don't worry
about him?

356
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:13,373
What do you mean?

357
00:21:13,424 --> 00:21:15,475
<i>Before</i> the turducken?

358
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:18,312
Yeah. Yeah,
I kind of mean more like, uh...

359
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:21,548
More like
ever since my head broke...

360
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,766
And we lost Cass.

361
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,051
I mean,
you ever feel like he's --

362
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:26,770
he's going through
the same motions

363
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:28,605
but he's not the same Dean,
you know?

364
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,107
How <i>could</i> he be?

365
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:32,442
Right, yeah,
but what if --

366
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:34,528
What if <i>what,</i> Sam?

367
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:37,080
You know,
you worry about him.

368
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:39,616
All he does
is worry about you.

369
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:42,369
Who's left to live
their own life here?

370
00:21:42,437 --> 00:21:43,754
The two of you --

371
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:46,673
aren't you full up
just playing snuffleupagus

372
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,792
with the devil
all the live long?

373
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:55,515
I don't know, Bobby.
Seeing Lucifer's fine with me.

374
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,201
Come again?

375
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,086
Look,
I'm not saying it's fun.

376
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:01,855
I mean,
to be honest with you,

377
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:04,191
I kind of see it
as the best-case scenario.

378
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:06,476
I mean...

379
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:11,198
At least all my crazy's
under one umbrella, you know?

380
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:14,401
I kind of know
what I'm dealing with.

381
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:18,055
A lot of people
got it worse.

382
00:22:18,122 --> 00:22:21,208
You always were one deep
little son of a bitch.

383
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:23,694
Wait, wait, wait.

384
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:25,662
Here we go.

385
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:53,640
Well, I guess
we follow him.

386
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:43,206
That's weird, right?

387
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,208
I mean, national franchise
like Biggerson's

388
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:46,626
getting meat from a place

389
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:49,413
that looks like it wholesales
Hong Kong knockoffs.

390
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:52,499
Okay. Yeah.
It's a little weird.

391
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,000
All right, well,

392
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:56,086
I guess we wait
till they close up shop,

393
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,370
go take a look around?

394
00:23:57,422 --> 00:23:59,806
Hang on.

395
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:09,633
No.

396
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:22,396
Edgar.

397
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:25,465
Leviathans.

398
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:34,975
Son of a bitch.

399
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:37,928
What the hell
is going on?

400
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:52,166
Put him with the others,
if you don't mind.

401
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:58,139
Edgar. Follow me.

402
00:24:58,223 --> 00:25:00,141
I've been so busy
with this experiment,

403
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:02,343
I didn't even realize
you were back.

404
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:03,811
It's, uh, big stuff.

405
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:06,013
I'm back
<i>because</i> of the experiment.

406
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:07,231
What's happening?

407
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,466
You said you were
refining the formula.

408
00:25:09,518 --> 00:25:11,802
Yes. Absolutely.
And it's going great.

409
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,638
The absorption rate is up
in lower concentrations.

410
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:17,274
But it didn't solve our little
issue with adverse reactions.

411
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:19,110
Well, no.

412
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:21,061
Not 100%.

413
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,659
Burn them.

414
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:37,678
What?

415
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:39,013
But they represent
crucial test data.

416
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:41,015
Where the additive formula
went wrong,

417
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:42,850
where my initial
projections failed.

418
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:45,136
Dick is coming.

419
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,224
Burn them.

420
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:03,237
There's nothing happening
back here at all.

421
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:04,321
Yeah, okay, Sam.

422
00:26:04,372 --> 00:26:05,956
Well,
they're pretty dug in,

423
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:08,459
so why don't you finish circling
and head on back?

424
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:13,547
How's your head?

425
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,885
Well, I think the slammer's
pretty much wore off.

426
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:20,171
In between that
and the 20 cups of coffee,

427
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,006
I'm nicely tense
and alarmed.

428
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:23,474
I wasn't talking
about that.

429
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,510
Oh, Bobby, don't --

430
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:29,096
don't go all Sigmund Freud
on me right now, okay?

431
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:31,048
I just got drugged
by a sandwich.

432
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:34,351
I want to talk
about your new party line.

433
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:35,819
Party line?

434
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:38,822
What are you talking about?
I don't even vote.

435
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,991
"The world's
a suicide case.

436
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:43,727
We save it,
it just steals more pills"?

437
00:26:43,778 --> 00:26:45,696
Bobby, I'm here, okay?
I'm on the case.

438
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:46,897
What's the problem?

439
00:26:46,948 --> 00:26:49,399
I've seen a lot of hunters
live and die.

440
00:26:49,451 --> 00:26:51,101
You're starting to talk like
one of the dead ones, Dean.

441
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:53,904
No, I'm talking
the way a person talks

442
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:56,757
when they've had it,
when they can't figure out

443
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:58,842
why they used to think
all this mattered.

444
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,844
Oh, you poor, sorry...

445
00:27:02,297 --> 00:27:04,798
You're <i>not</i> a person.

446
00:27:04,883 --> 00:27:05,766
Thanks.

447
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,218
Come on, now.

448
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:09,086
You tried to hang it up

449
00:27:09,137 --> 00:27:11,639
and be a person
with Lisa and Ben.

450
00:27:11,723 --> 00:27:13,107
And now here you are

451
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:15,859
with a mean old coot
and a van full of guns.

452
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:17,861
That ain't
person behavior, son.

453
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:19,429
You're a hunter,

454
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:22,199
meaning you're whatever the job
you're doing today.

455
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,568
Now, you get a case
of the Anne Sextons,

456
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:26,237
something's gonna
come up behind you

457
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:28,022
and rip
your fool head off.

458
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:30,958
Now, you find your <i>reasons</i>
<i>to get back in the game.</i>

459
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:33,777
I don't care if it's love
or spite or a $10 bet.

460
00:27:33,828 --> 00:27:36,230
I've been to enough funerals.
I mean it.

461
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,386
You die before me,
and I'll kill you.

462
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:46,473
We need to scrape
some money together,

463
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:47,841
get you a condo
or something.

464
00:27:49,344 --> 00:27:52,096
Hey.
Something's up.

465
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,861
Well, I'll be a squirrel
in a skirt.

466
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:10,531
It's Dick frigging Roman.

467
00:28:10,615 --> 00:28:13,450
What? Who the hell
is Dick frigging Roman?

468
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:14,668
Billionaire Dick Roman,

469
00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:16,320
seen here at
a recent press conference,

470
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:18,122
has been on the
corporate-takeover warpath

471
00:28:18,173 --> 00:28:21,292
in the last several months
and shows no signs of relenting.

472
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:23,677
I believe in good old
American values,

473
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:25,095
like unlimited growth.

474
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:26,964
But it's like I always say --

475
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:30,167
if you want to win,
then you got to be the shark.

476
00:28:30,218 --> 00:28:31,769
And a shark's got to eat.

477
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,670
Well, that's a great question.

478
00:28:33,722 --> 00:28:35,939
Yes, we have made
new acquisitions.

479
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,342
I don't believe
in hostile takeovers.

480
00:28:38,393 --> 00:28:41,845
I believe in merging...
and coming out on top.

481
00:28:41,896 --> 00:28:44,398
Whether at the helm of
his America's cup-winning yacht

482
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:46,400
or one of his
Fortune 500 companies,

483
00:28:46,468 --> 00:28:48,702
Roman has never shied away
from the spotlight.

484
00:28:48,787 --> 00:28:51,322
Roman's record-breaking series
of motivational seminars,

485
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:52,706
"When in Rome," have outsold

486
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:54,958
every other money-making program
on the market.

487
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:56,693
A vocal member of the NRA

488
00:28:56,745 --> 00:28:58,495
and a steadfast supporter
of the second amendment,

489
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:00,030
Roman has started attracting

490
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:02,532
some conservative
political attention, as well.

491
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:05,369
Roman is ruthless,
but good-looking.

492
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,888
I think he'll make
a great candidate.

493
00:29:07,972 --> 00:29:09,340
Another great question.

494
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:12,476
No, I am not running for
political office at this time.

495
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,396
But I do have
a number-one bestseller.

496
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,848
Holy crap.

497
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:19,549
What the hell <i>is</i> that?

498
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:20,651
That's one of the top 50

499
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,269
most powerful men
in America, Dean.

500
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:24,605
Says here top 35
as of last month.

501
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:27,557
Now it's all
making sense.

502
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:29,276
Remember when Crowley kept
going on about hating Dick?

503
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,863
I thought he was just
being general. Pfft!

504
00:29:32,914 --> 00:29:34,431
Well,
if the Leviathan got to him,

505
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:36,950
then that means they're playing
on a much bigger board

506
00:29:37,035 --> 00:29:38,452
than we were thinking.

507
00:29:38,536 --> 00:29:41,405
So what, then? I mean,
we can't exactly outgun them.

508
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:43,540
No, but we got
the drop on them.

509
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:45,409
Means we got a chance
to figure out

510
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,261
what these guys
are really doing here.

511
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:51,932
Whoa.
Where'd you get <i>that</i> mother?

512
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:53,851
It's on loan from
Frank's big brother collection.

513
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,019
It'll pick up
vocal vibrations

514
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:58,105
from window glass
at half a mile.

515
00:30:00,141 --> 00:30:01,608
Well, it's time to find out

516
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:03,660
what these ugly bastards
are up to.

517
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:06,763
[ <i>Rossini's "William Tell</i>
<i>Overture: Call to Cows" plays</i> ]

518
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,369
<i>The patient is put</i>
<i>under general anesthesia.</i>

519
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,288
<i>The eye is immobilized,</i>

520
00:30:14,372 --> 00:30:17,825
<i>then a scalpel is used</i>
<i>to sever the optic nerve.</i>

521
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:26,417
The food additive
that I've introduced

522
00:30:26,468 --> 00:30:29,670
into the Turducken has a
near-100% rate of effectiveness.

523
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:31,422
Once the subject tries it,

524
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:33,674
they crave more
within a few hours.

525
00:30:33,758 --> 00:30:36,560
With the very first dose,
it starts to work on their DNA,

526
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,929
slowing their metabolism,
causing weight gain,

527
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,931
and dampening
their emotional range,

528
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:42,900
which makes them
perfectly complacent.

529
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,468
As you can see,

530
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,689
they have yet to notice that
grandma is no longer with us.

531
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:55,329
True, if you leave out
a cooked patty

532
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:56,613
for more than an hour,

533
00:30:56,664 --> 00:30:58,615
it reverts back
to a somewhat, uh,

534
00:30:58,666 --> 00:30:59,867
unappealing state,

535
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:02,202
but I have yet to have a case
of leftovers.

536
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,587
You know what I love?

537
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:06,673
I mean, besides handball
and a really crisp Chardonnay.

538
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:08,825
I love progress.

539
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:10,994
And I know that progress comes
from collaboration,

540
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:13,263
which is what makes moments
like this so thrilling.

541
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,632
I am so glad
to hear you say that.

542
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:18,018
Now, what can you tell me
about your failures?

543
00:31:18,102 --> 00:31:19,019
Hmm? My...

544
00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:23,557
The ones that went off
the rails

545
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:26,343
after they ate
your little treats.

546
00:31:26,394 --> 00:31:29,029
I, um...
They're, uh...

547
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:31,848
- They've been very instructive.
- No.

548
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,734
See, I asked
for complacency.

549
00:31:33,802 --> 00:31:35,319
Not complacency

550
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,238
and a 0.03% margin of
hyperadrenalized cannibalism.

551
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:40,824
I will have this
under control.

552
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:44,778
"Camping high season
harshed by human burrito"?

553
00:31:44,846 --> 00:31:46,029
Have I ever mentioned
how I feel

554
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,249
about our little forays
making the papers?

555
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:51,752
But, again,
collaboration.

556
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:53,921
Progress.

557
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:57,424
I want to turn
this little mistake

558
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:00,093
into a big fat
teachable moment.

559
00:32:00,178 --> 00:32:02,429
Will you help me
with that?

560
00:32:02,514 --> 00:32:05,098
Well...Yes.

561
00:32:05,183 --> 00:32:06,583
Of course.

562
00:32:08,486 --> 00:32:10,020
Our side's still dead,
Bobby.

563
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:11,488
Anything with you?

564
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:13,607
Same here.

565
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:17,611
I got -- hold on.

566
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:20,781
Yeah, I got movement --
my side, second floor,

567
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:21,915
meeting room.

568
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,500
And I'll reschedule

569
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:24,901
with the Senator
for lunch Tuesday.

570
00:32:24,953 --> 00:32:26,753
You can deal with the
archdiocese in the afternoon.

571
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:28,088
Fine.

572
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:29,540
Dick, please,
let me explain to you

573
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:31,074
what our program
has to offer.

574
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:34,344
No. Let me explain why we're
shutting your program down.

575
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:36,129
We're shutting it down?
No, you can't --

576
00:32:36,214 --> 00:32:38,715
I'm shutting it down
because of the one golden rule.

577
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:39,850
Do you know it?

578
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,435
Yes.
"Don't make the papers."

579
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,686
And I promise that --

580
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,087
No, the golden rule is

581
00:32:44,138 --> 00:32:46,256
there's no such thing
as monsters.

582
00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:49,226
Anything stirs their little pots
to the contrary --

583
00:32:49,277 --> 00:32:50,561
very bad for our plans.

584
00:32:50,612 --> 00:32:52,362
So, how can I use
your mistake

585
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,731
to communicate this
to all your coworkers?

586
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,483
Listen, sir,
I will do anything.

587
00:32:56,568 --> 00:32:58,452
I will give <i>anything</i>
<i>to make this right.</i>

588
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:03,373
I know you will.

589
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:19,139
You're bibbing me?

590
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,571
Do you know what you can
give us, doctor?

591
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,859
Your example.

592
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:44,748
What's happening now?

593
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,199
Wait.

594
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:48,118
Now, Doc.

595
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:50,754
It's time.

596
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,262
Now I have officially
seen it all.

597
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,631
Bobby, what is it?

598
00:34:00,682 --> 00:34:03,667
He's making the doctor
eat himself.

599
00:34:03,718 --> 00:34:04,452
What?

600
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:05,453
He's --

601
00:34:13,481 --> 00:34:15,832
They got him.

602
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:18,618
Dean, there are at least
four Leviathans out there.

603
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,587
We don't even know how
to kill one.

604
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:27,494
Well,
it'll be quite a shock

605
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,680
when we walk in through
the front door, won't it?

606
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:33,967
We'll have the jet
on standby at O'Hare.

607
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:36,386
Thursday morning, you close on
the land acquisition in Gleason.

608
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:38,105
Fine.

609
00:34:38,172 --> 00:34:40,507
And <i>this</i> came
this afternoon.

610
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:43,110
- Sotheby's.
- Outstanding!

611
00:34:43,177 --> 00:34:45,779
Thank you, Susan.

612
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:47,514
Oh, and, Susan?

613
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:48,865
Hmm?

614
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:49,950
Uh, tuh-tuh.

615
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:03,447
No, you're not tied up.
Why waste the effort?

616
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:05,248
We both know that
you're not gonna get past me.

617
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,550
How's your head?

618
00:35:06,634 --> 00:35:09,186
So you got Dick Roman.

619
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:11,922
We can have
whoever we want.

620
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:13,807
We could have <i>you,</i>
<i>for example.</i>

621
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:15,492
<i>If</i> you were
worth the effort.

622
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,177
Oh, you're hurting
my feelings.

623
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:18,979
Well,
it's a hard world, Bob.

624
00:35:19,046 --> 00:35:20,480
It's an us-eat-dog world.

625
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:21,765
What do you got there?

626
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:24,501
Winning bid at auction.

627
00:35:27,488 --> 00:35:29,322
Beautiful.

628
00:35:31,058 --> 00:35:34,494
Known for
their peerless sighting.

629
00:35:34,562 --> 00:35:36,896
I imagine
you appreciate guns.

630
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:38,532
I'd appreciate one
right about now.

631
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,917
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

632
00:35:41,002 --> 00:35:42,953
But I mean the machine,
the idea.

633
00:35:43,037 --> 00:35:46,706
Just one of your species'
most inspired inventions.

634
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:48,842
I mean it. I really think
you guys have spunk.

635
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,127
You're like a planet

636
00:35:50,211 --> 00:35:52,462
of just the cutest little
engines that could.

637
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:54,047
But...

638
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:57,517
Like the late, great, <i>actual</i>
<i>Dick Roman used to say</i>

639
00:35:57,585 --> 00:36:00,720
to the whores he'd kick out
of the presidential suite...

640
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,391
...Cute don't quite
hack it, sugar.

641
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:08,061
Oh, let's just
cut to the chase.

642
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:11,615
I clearly ain't worth the extra
time I'm getting here.

643
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:13,900
I'm gonna eat you, Bob.

644
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:17,571
Yes.

645
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:19,439
But I like
my meals prepared.

646
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,325
Besides, holding on to you
could pay big dividends.

647
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,545
I bet your friends are on their
way to rescue the damsel.

648
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:27,113
Nah,
they're too smart.

649
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:29,299
They know
they don't have the numbers.

650
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:31,117
It'd be suicide.

651
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:35,555
I've run my race.
Could die worse.

652
00:37:04,126 --> 00:37:06,661
I'd stay in the chair.

653
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,566
Okay, sons of bitches.

654
00:37:45,617 --> 00:37:48,252
See what you're up to now.

655
00:37:49,671 --> 00:38:05,853
You're coming with me.

656
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:15,262
Sam...

657
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:18,366
That is not how we communicate
from a place of yes.

658
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:21,202
That was bracing.

659
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:23,070
Where'd you kids
find this stuff?

660
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:27,325
Hey!

661
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:29,877
That's mine.

662
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:34,081
Go! Go!

663
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:38,052
Would you stop it
with that stuff?

664
00:38:45,794 --> 00:38:47,845
Damn it, where's Bobby?

665
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:57,471
Bobby! Come on!

666
00:38:57,522 --> 00:38:58,689
Come on! Come on!

667
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,827
Go! Go!

668
00:39:13,622 --> 00:39:16,990
Son of a bitch!

669
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:18,492
I'm glad you got in.

670
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:21,379
He almost took
your freaking head off.

671
00:39:21,496 --> 00:39:25,349
Hey, Bobby, your hat.

672
00:39:32,274 --> 00:39:33,858
Bobby?

673
00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:35,142
Oh, God. Bobby?!

674
00:39:35,193 --> 00:39:36,894
Bobby?!

675
00:39:36,962 --> 00:39:39,814
Bobby?!
