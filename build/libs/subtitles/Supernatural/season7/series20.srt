1
00:00:02,424 --> 00:00:05,803
Frank Devereaux --
he's a jackass and a lunatic.

2
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:08,021
He's also a surveillance expert.

3
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:10,524
"Hey, Frank, go dig up some dirt
on Richard Roman."

4
00:00:10,526 --> 00:00:13,127
That night, I was burned off
every I.P. I had.

5
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:15,579
Ears on my phone,
eyes on my house...

6
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:16,864
Dick's got people
watching you?

7
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:19,500
Frank! Don't shoot!
We're coming in.

8
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:21,869
Who's to say this ain't
the day they come for old Frank

9
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:23,120
who knew too much.

10
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:25,339
Bobby! Hey!

11
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:26,681
Your time is up.

12
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:28,562
Bobby. You ran away
from your reaper?

13
00:00:32,547 --> 00:00:33,881
Hi, boys.

14
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:35,933
- Bobby.
- You can see me?

15
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,000
Rethink it, Bobby.

16
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,602
We still have work to do.

17
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:40,220
It's not right.
You know that.

18
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:41,838
What was I thinking?

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,850
So, what do you think
we should do?

20
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:43,475
I don't know.

21
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,009
Everything
is supposed to end.

22
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:48,695
You know,
he was supposed...

23
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:54,701
Now...What are the odds
this ends well?

24
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,522
What are the odds?

25
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:07,047
Yeah, I hear you. All right,
well, thanks for looking.

26
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,865
Yep. Bye.

27
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,418
So, Nora didn't see any pattern
to the dig sites either.

28
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,203
Yeah, 'cause they got
nothing in common.

29
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:14,538
And I got nothing
from local lore

30
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,306
50 miles in every direction
of all of them.

31
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:18,141
I mean, it's like
they're just...

32
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:20,227
old dirt.

33
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:21,762
What's Dick looking for?

34
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:33,390
Hey, hey, go easy,
you idjits.

35
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:34,825
Sorry for the jump scare.

36
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:36,059
So how does this work, huh?

37
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,778
I leave the cap off
and you just genie your way out?

38
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,247
I wish it were that easy.

39
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:41,949
The thing is --

40
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:44,451
Bobby?

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,874
Damn it.
It's hard to stay focused.

42
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:52,259
I'm still kind of worn out.

43
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,394
You've been pretty busy
for a dead guy.

44
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:55,596
All right. Listen.

45
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:57,848
I-I don't know how long
before my next ghost nap,

46
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,466
so let's just
skip to the skinny --

47
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:01,184
those numbers I gave you.

48
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:04,421
The empty lot
in Cheeseville?

49
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,273
Yeah, well, it ain't gonna be
empty for long.

50
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,225
I got a gander
at Dick's big plan,

51
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:10,093
right before
he Lincolned me.

52
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,479
They're breaking ground --
what month is this?

53
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,730
Uh, April.

54
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:15,315
Ground's broke.

55
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:16,733
They're surveying.

56
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:18,552
They're getting ready
to build something.

57
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:20,320
- Build what?
- Exactly.

58
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:21,438
What?

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,707
They're building
as we're yammering.

60
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,792
Check it out yourself.
It's all right.

61
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:28,629
I mean, you guys missed it
because you've been kind of busy

62
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:30,380
killing ghosts
the past few days.

63
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:34,902
But Dick is about to get into
the Soylent Green business.

64
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,621
That site'll show you they're
building a biotech lab, right?

65
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:39,840
Biotech my ass.

66
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:41,491
That sucker

67
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,260
is a state-of-the-art
slaughterhouse.

68
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:44,511
And we're the beef.

69
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:46,680
Don't you think that's
a little bold, even for Dick?

70
00:02:46,682 --> 00:02:48,515
I bet you
no one will even notice,

71
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:51,268
'cause first,
he's gonna dumb us all down

72
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,153
with Turducken-style
munchies.

73
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:54,488
Make us docile.

74
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:57,441
It's in the meat.

75
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,276
We haven't been to Biggerson's
since that whole fiasco.

76
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:02,913
Biggerson's? He's bought a list
of joints 10 pages long.

77
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:04,114
Ah.

78
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:06,033
Next, he's gonna cure us.

79
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:07,584
Cure us of what?

80
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:10,921
All the biggies --
cancer, aids, heart disease.

81
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:13,340
Let's just say they got an
affinity for stem-cell research.

82
00:03:13,342 --> 00:03:16,176
The, uh,
Leviathan real-estate mooks

83
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:17,761
building
that cancer center.

84
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:20,631
It's going to be
a research center.

85
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,698
Research for what?

86
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,849
They're not hunting anymore.

87
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:25,035
They're engineering
the perfect herd.

88
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:28,522
With the very first dose,
it starts to work on their DNA,

89
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:30,474
slowing their metabolism,
causing weight gain,

90
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,008
and dampening
their emotional range,

91
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,394
which makes them
perfectly complacent.

92
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:36,012
Now,
we've gone up against plenty --

93
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:37,280
liked to eat a few folk
in the woods.

94
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:38,565
This ain't that.

95
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:41,351
This is about knocking us off
the top of the food chain.

96
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:43,820
This is about them Levis
living here forever,

97
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:44,905
one-percenter style,

98
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:47,124
while we march
our dopey, fat asses

99
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,943
down to the shiny new
death camps at every corner.

100
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:07,594
It's an e-mail...

101
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:08,679
from Frank.

102
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,746
Frank's alive?

103
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:12,849
That jackass,
always stealing my thunder.

104
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:16,453
"Sam and Dean, if you're
reading this, I'm dead..."

105
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,774
"...or worse.

106
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:22,609
"This e-mail was sent

107
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:25,062
"because some prince is trying
to hack into my hard drive

108
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,079
"right this second.

109
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:27,831
So unless it's you,
you got trouble."

110
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:35,505
Um  okay

111
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:37,708
"my drive is full
of compromising info.

112
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,910
Your new aliases, hangouts,
where you stored your car..."

113
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:42,212
Baby?

114
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:44,347
Even though he encrypted
the crap out of his drive,

115
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,766
he says we should assume

116
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:48,418
that someone can hack into it
eventually.

117
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,337
He did put a tracking device
in it.

118
00:04:52,356 --> 00:04:55,425
All right, let's see
where Frank's drive is.

119
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:00,947
Perfect.

120
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,984
It's in the middle
of the Death Star.

? hey ?

138
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,587
How'd it go last night?

139
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:49,089
Charlie,

140
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:51,725
it's a moral imperative you let
me live vicariously through you.

141
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:54,344
Pictures or it didn't happen,
right?

142
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:02,435
You hooked up
at a charity benefit?

143
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:04,604
If you can't score at a
reproductive rights function,

144
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:06,940
then you simply
cannot score.

145
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:08,675
Wait. Is that legal?

146
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:11,077
We were
two consenting adults.

147
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,046
No. <i>That.</i>

148
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:16,750
Why do you insist on breaking
the law on company property?

149
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:19,235
Mmm, faster Internet connection
here.

150
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:21,371
Oh, well, if Pete finds out,
he's gonna fire you...

151
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:22,839
or get you arrested.

152
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,908
Teddy Bear Pete?
Please.

153
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,510
You know I've been doing this
for like a month.

154
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:29,296
I can cover
my tracks, Harry.

155
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:30,297
Trust me.

156
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,382
Charlie!

157
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:35,936
My office. Now.

158
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,255
- I love you.
- I know.

159
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:49,482
Charlie Bradbury?

160
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:51,368
Dick.

161
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,286
Sit.

162
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:02,913
Charlie, I've been
running things for, well,

163
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:06,549
feels like since before
the dawn of man.

164
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:08,585
Always had a vision.

165
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,971
I'm close
to realizing that dream.

166
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:14,608
I don't want to brag, but
the world is my dinner plate.

167
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,477
And I don't want anything
to jeopardize that --

168
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,964
definitely not the actions
of one tiny, little person.

169
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:24,317
Sir, sir, I can fix this.
Please -- please don't fire me.

170
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,286
What's she talking about?

171
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,471
Is that about hacking
those Super Pacs?

172
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:32,542
'Cause <i>that</i> was adorable.

173
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,444
Tell me, how does
a high-school dropout

174
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,529
become one of the
brightest minds at Roman, Inc.?

175
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:40,583
Um...Honestly...
Historically,

176
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:42,669
I've had this problem
with -- with authority --

177
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:43,920
no offense --

178
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:46,556
so I realized the only way
to get away with being me

179
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:50,543
was to be as indispensable
as possible.

180
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:53,880
Sorry.

181
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:57,717
You're kind of completing me
right now, Charlie.

182
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:00,053
You have that spark,

183
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:03,006
that thing that makes humans
so special.

184
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,008
Not everyone has it,
you know.

185
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,893
Those people --
they can be replaced.

186
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:10,346
But people like you...
are impossible to copy.

187
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:11,865
C-copy?

188
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:13,683
Take the compliment.

189
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:17,721
This belonged
to one Frank Devereaux.

190
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,090
Thought he could bring down
the whole company.

191
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,409
He was wrong.
Let's keep him wrong.

192
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:25,912
It's encrypted, or whatever
you crazy kids say these days.

193
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:27,831
Break it open
and bring it to me.

194
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,749
Yeah, I'm on it.
And -- and thank you.

195
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:31,468
You're welcome.

196
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,737
You have three days
or you're fired.

197
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,755
Good talk.

198
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:41,144
Is this real life?

199
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:46,850
Dick Roman gave me
an assignment.

200
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,601
Is that...Good?

201
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:51,321
It means the Eye of Sauron
is on me.

202
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:55,358
Well, if you need anything,
I'll be back in the shire.

203
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,217
All right, H.
It's just you and me now.

Wait a second.

212

Seriously?

213
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,156

216
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:51,798
That was hardly
the Chamber of Secrets, right?

217
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,166
Booyah.

218
00:11:02,978 --> 00:11:05,562
And back to square one.

219
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,132
Let's see where
Frank's drive is.

220
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:10,817
Perfect.

221
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:13,853
It's in the middle
of the Death Star.

222
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:17,273
All right, well,
off to Chicago.

223
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,910
No, wait, boys,
you can't just break in.

224
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:23,312
They know your mugs.

225
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:26,649
What if we mailed in the flask?

226
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,284
Then I could ghost through
the joint.

227
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:31,104
I mean, it's not like
Dick can kill me twice.

228
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:33,339
What,
you got a better plan?

229
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:36,426
Come on.

230
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:37,660
Just because I'm dead

231
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:39,546
doesn't mean I don't know
how to do my damn job.

232
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:43,633
Bobby,
that's Dick's office.

233
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,352
I think
what Sam's trying to say is,

234
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:48,671
what happens
if you run into Dick

235
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:53,276
and, you know...
go vengeful.

236
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,344
You know it's not something
you can just shake off.

237
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:57,513
Come on.
Give me some credit.

238
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:01,634
What, I'm supposed to
just ride the pine?

239
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,154
Sorry, Bobby.

240
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,175
Did you go home
last night?

241
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:28,094
I'll get us some coffee.

242
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:30,680
I assume you want
some crack in yours.

243
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,900
Yes, please.

244
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:40,073
Finally.

245
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:50,416
Who is this d-bag?

246
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,254
Don't do it.

247
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:57,724
Roman said
to bring it right to him.

248
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:03,813
You're right, H.
You're always right.

249
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,760
What the frak's a Leviathan?

250
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:19,862

How goes it?

267
00:14:10,865 --> 00:14:14,117
Pretty sure I spent the last 24
hours hacking into a loony bin.

268
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,501
Where's Pete?

269
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:18,838
Uh, probably snuck down
to the garage for a smoky treat.

270
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:29,849
How's it going
with that drive?

271
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:31,050
Uh, great.

272
00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:33,269
Charlie was here
all night.

273
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:34,971
You know, that drive's
very important to me.

274
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:36,306
I'm gonna want
a watchful eye kept.

275
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,224
Well,
I will do just that.

276
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:40,193
No. <i>You</i> won't.

277
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:45,514
Bruce Springsteen, Eli Manning,
our own little Charlie --

278
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:46,849
you know what they are?

279
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:48,034
Irreplaceable.

280
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:51,871
You're more of a Tim Tebow,
Joe Biden type.

281
00:14:52,606 --> 00:14:54,657
You got no spark in you.

282
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:57,093
In fact,
there's nothing in you...

283
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,495
except Daryl's dinner.

284
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:31,160
Hey, Pete, sorry I left
without telling you.

285
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:34,163
No, I just wasn't...
feeling well.

286
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:35,832
It's a...lady thing.

287
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,867
I will be in first thing.

288
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:39,568
Got to go -- cramps.

289
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:52,682
It's all right.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

290
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:54,884
Get away from me, you...

291
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:56,419
Shapeshifter!

292
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:57,603
Look,
we're not shapeshifters.

293
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:58,688
Oh!

294
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,106
Geez!

295
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,444
Look, we're not Leviathans,
okay?

296
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,778
You want us to prove it?

297
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,931
You know what borax does
to them?

298
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:10,266
Sam?

299
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:14,320
Huh?

300
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:15,488
Your turn.

301
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,625
Good.

302
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:23,796
Who the hell are you guys?

303
00:16:25,782 --> 00:16:30,470
<i>America --</i>
<i>a nation of greatness...</i>

304
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:34,290
<i>...a nation</i>
<i>of hardworking individuals.</i>

00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:35,808
<i>And, rest assured,</i>

<i>no one works harder for you</i>
<i>than Sucrocorp.</i>

<i>Here at Sucrocorp,</i>

<i>your well-being</i>
<i>is our number-one priority.</i>

00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:55,411
<i>Sucrocorp --</i>
<i>eat well, live well.</i>

310
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:05,078
So you're saying, you guys
are monster hunters.

311
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:07,907
So, there are other monsters?

312
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:10,326
Stop. Never mind.
Just shh.

313
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:13,613
Okay, I get
how you tracked the drive --

314
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,349
straight GPS --
but it's still at the office.

315
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:18,267
How did you find <i>me?</i>

316
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:27,426
Aw! Son of a gun
jacked my webcam?!

317
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:28,461
Welcome to Frank.

318
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,431
It's creepy,
but I'll give it to him.

319
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:36,352
So you're telling me everything
he had on his drive is true.

320
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:38,254
That and more.

321
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:41,140
Wait. How long did it take you
to crack into Frank's drive?

322
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:42,475
A day or so.

323
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:44,777
Is there anything
you <i>can't</i> hack into?

324
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:46,195
Not yet.

325
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:47,697
How about
Dick Roman's e-mail?

326
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,899
Why would I...

327
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,284
Oh. He's one of them.

328
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:53,319
No. Uh,
he's their leader.

329
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:55,388
So what's the end game --

330
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,540
steal our resources,
make us some slaves?

331
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,592
Planet-wide value meal.
We're the meat.

332
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:03,095
You can't be...serious.

333
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:07,250
Okay. All right.
Let's do this.

334
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,801
What am I looking for?

335
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:12,054
Well, for starters, uh, anything
about archaeological dig sites.

336
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:14,590
Like Indiana Jones stuff?

337
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,742
All we know is that Dick has
been digging all over the world,

338
00:18:16,744 --> 00:18:18,311
and we need to know
what he's looking for.

339
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:20,513
You know, I was having
a really good week.

340
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:22,899
I met someone,
downloaded the new Robyn album.

341
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,318
Everything
was coming up me.

342
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,069
Oh, crap.

343
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:28,470
Look, we get it sucks.

344
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:29,805
No, not that. This.

345
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:32,024
Dick's e-mail isn't
on the company server.

346
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:34,076
It's on a private one,
in his office.

347
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:35,745
Meaning?

348
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,747
Can't get in it unless you have
his phone or you're at his desk.

349
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,332
So you're saying that if
we're inside Dick's office,

350
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:40,833
then we can hack into
his e-mail?

351
00:18:40,835 --> 00:18:42,668
You can't.
Only someone like...

352
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,373
But I sure as hell
ain't doing it.

353
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,959
I am doing my job
and...

354
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,378
What are the chances
I see everything on that drive

355
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,697
and Dick lets me live
anyway?

356
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:57,199
I think you know.

357
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:02,504
So I erase the drive first,
protect me and you.

358
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:04,506
Then I go back
to my old life, right?

359
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,810
- What?
- It's not that easy.

360
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:09,195
You're on Dick's radar,

361
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:12,248
which means you don't have
an old life anymore.

362
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,533
I'm gonna die.

363
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:17,904
I should have taken that job
at Google.

364
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:23,826
Look, Charlie,
it's okay if you can't do it.

365
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:25,795
I mean,
you didn't volunteer for this.

366
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:29,048
Totally. Exactly.

367
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,717
But now I volunteer.

368
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,437
What?

369
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,223
I got to go back in anyways
to wipe Frank's drive.

370
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:39,892
Might as well
break into Dick's office, too.

371
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:42,845
Are you sure?

372
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:45,648
No. But these things
are gonna eat everyone I know.

373
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,034
What kind of douche bag
stands by for that?

374
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:51,237
However, I have never
broken into anything

375
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:53,789
in real life before,
so...plan?

376
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,659
Got a Bluetooth?

377
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:57,743
Yeah.

378
00:19:57,745 --> 00:19:58,995
Security system --
can you get into that?

379
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,330
I can reroute any
surveillance cameras we need.

380
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:02,915
All right.
Let's start with that.

381
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,733
Do you have a key card
to get in the building?

382
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,035
Uh, yeah.

383
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:09,905
I can't duplicate it,
but I can make a fake backing.

384
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:19,415
How's it going?

385
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,267
Great,
since she set all this up.

386
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:23,319
Um, look.

387
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:25,271
See this?

388
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:27,589
I can put each camera
on a prerecorded loop.

389
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:29,275
Once I do that,
she'll have 15 minutes.

390
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:30,860
15 minutes
ain't a lot of time.

391
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:31,978
No.

392
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,629
She said if it took longer
to hack his desktop,

393
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:35,097
then she deserved
to be eaten.

394
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,399
I like her.

395
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:40,602
Wait. Is that...

396
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:43,406
Son of a bitch.

397
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,992
What?
Look at her bag.

398
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:50,162
Bobby.

399
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:52,048
Wait. Y-you think he --

400
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,383
hitched a ride after
we told him to cool his jets?

401
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:56,419
Yeah.
What the hell's he thinking?

402
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,470
He's not.

403
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:59,989
So what do we do --
call the whole thing off?

404
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:01,841
We only got
one shot at this.

405
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,478
? used to think
maybe you loved me ? --

406
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Charlie, Dean.

407
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:08,898
Are you singing?

408
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,466
I sing when I'm nervous.
Don't judge me.

409
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:11,984
Judgment-free zone.

410
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:15,187
Listen, uh, check
the side pocket in your bag.

411
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,239
Oh.

412
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:19,475
Thank you.

413
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:23,812
Mmm. Good idea.

414
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,031
Yeah, no problem.

415
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,816
Look, that's, uh, kind of
a family heirloom.

416
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:30,453
It's a good-luck charm,
okay, so don't lose it.

417
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,088
Copy that.

418
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,173
Okay.

419
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:36,792
Let's do this.

420
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:41,914
Uh, Charlie?

421
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:45,801
Uh, Charlie?

422
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:47,019
I'm having a hard time moving.

423
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:49,138
You can do this.

424
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,006
Uh, I'm -- I'm not a spy.

425
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:53,392
No, I can't do it. I can't
do it. I can't do it. I can't.

426
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:55,010
Charlie, hey, it's Sam.
I'm sorry, Sam.

427
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:57,363
I'm sorry. I-I just --
it's okay.

428
00:21:57,365 --> 00:22:01,233
Uh, listen, w-who's your favorite
"Harry Potter" character?

429
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:05,921
Uh, Hermione.

430
00:22:05,923 --> 00:22:06,906
Hermione.

431
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,075
Well, uh, all right,
did Hermione run

432
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,210
when Sirius Black
was in trouble

433
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:13,896
or when Voldemort
attacked Hogwarts?

434
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:14,880
- Seriously?
- Shut it.

435
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:17,216
No, of course not.

436
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:19,135
What did she do?

437
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,420
She kicked ass.

438
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:24,807
She actually saves Harry
in practically every book.

439
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:26,036
And then she ends up
with the wrong --

440
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:26,893
Uh, stay on track.

441
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:28,177
Okay,
so she kicked ass, right?

442
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:30,312
So, then,
what are you gonna do?

443
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:33,816
I'm gonna kick it in the ass.

444
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:35,684
Good girl.

445
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:40,022
Oh, you go, dumble-dork.

446
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:37,746
I'm in.

447
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:39,498
I've always wanted to say that.

448
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,717
You're on the clock.

449
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,801
Move.

450
00:23:55,682 --> 00:23:59,652
Hey, there's a big-ass guard
up here, blocking the door.

451
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:00,819
What do I do?

452
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:02,154
Just wait him out.

453
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:07,826
He's not going anywhere.

454
00:24:10,113 --> 00:24:12,198
Okay, uh,
you work there every day.

455
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,999
- Do you know the guy?
- I guess.

456
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:15,668
I mean, I've seen him.
I've never talked to him.

457
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,187
Okay, when you've seen him,
does he look at you,

458
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:20,322
or does he just kind of
slide his eyes by?

459
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:24,393
Um...Eye contact?
I don't know.

460
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:25,844
He always kind of smiles a bit.

461
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:27,346
- I don't really --
- Good.

462
00:24:27,348 --> 00:24:29,465
What you're gonna do is you're
gonna walk right up to him,

463
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,967
and you're gonna flirt
your way past.

464
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:34,836
I can't.
He's not my type.

465
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:36,889
You're gonna have to play
through that.

466
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:39,141
As in he's not a girl.

467
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:42,778
Oh, oh.

468
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:46,398
Pretend he has boobs.

469
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:48,734
Worse.

470
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:52,955
I don't know. Um...
Do you have any tattoos?

471
00:24:52,957 --> 00:24:54,690
Give him a little sneak peek
there.

472
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:56,375
All tattoos are sexy.

473
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:58,494
Mine is Princess Leia
in a slave bikini

474
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,995
straddling a 20-sided die.

475
00:25:01,681 --> 00:25:03,865
I was drunk.
It was Comic-Con.

476
00:25:05,252 --> 00:25:07,253
We've all been there.

477
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,537
Okay, I'm gonna walk you
through this.

478
00:25:13,427 --> 00:25:16,645
Start with a smile.

479
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:17,930
Relax, Charlie.

480
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:19,098
You just got home,

481
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,601
and Scarlett Johansson's
waiting for you.

482
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:25,654
Can I help you, miss?

483
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:28,774
Hey...Bill.
Charlie from I.T.

484
00:25:28,776 --> 00:25:31,560
Oh. Burning the midnight oil,
huh?

485
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:35,331
Just like you -- I mean,
when you're not at the gym.

486
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,083
What, do you work out
with all your free time?

487
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:41,003
I try to get to the
gym at least three days a week.

488
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:43,038
You know, just trying to
get back to my fighting weight,

489
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,174
you know?
It shows. You look amazing.

490
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,242
It shows.
You look amazing.

491
00:25:47,244 --> 00:25:48,577
This never happened.

492
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:49,995
Do you ever do anything else
with your free time,

493
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:51,597
like take a girl out
for a drink?

494
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,049
You do anything else
with your free time,

495
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,917
like take a girl out for a drink?
Stop laughing, Sammy.

496
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,936
Stop laughing, Sammy.

497
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:01,390
Um...Y-you don't know
that bar --

498
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:02,591
Stop Laughing Sammy?

499
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:04,259
That place
is bringing sexy back.

500
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:05,894
Stop talking, Charlie!
Which is easy, 'cause they kept the receipt.

501
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:07,946
Stop talking, Charlie.
Right.

502
00:26:07,948 --> 00:26:13,769
So, um, y-you were saying
about going out, drinks?

503
00:26:14,654 --> 00:26:17,990
Um...Yeah, yeah.
That'd be great.

504
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:20,376
Cool.
Pencil that in.

505
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,110
Hey,
can I ask you a favor?

506
00:26:22,112 --> 00:26:24,496
The ladies' room downstairs
is nasty.

507
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:27,750
Can I use the exec washroom
to powder my nose?

508
00:26:29,502 --> 00:26:32,120
Yeah, yeah. Why not?
Um, it's right down the hall.

509
00:26:32,122 --> 00:26:34,840
It's the first door
on the right.

510
00:26:43,817 --> 00:26:44,933
I feel dirty.

511
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:47,135
You and me both, sister.

512
00:26:48,071 --> 00:26:50,406
The eagle is landing.

513
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,074
Going radio-silent.

514
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:54,576
Let us know
when you're out.

515
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:56,528
So, guess we just wait?

516
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,497
Yeah.

517
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:18,784
Your password
is "w1nn1ng" with two 1's?

518
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:20,636
Ew!

519
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,536
Okay. Let's Yoda this.

520
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:20,228
Hey, you!

521
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,864
What are you doing
in here?

522
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,749
You said first door
on the left, right?

523
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:25,534
No, I said first door
on the right.

524
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:28,337
Oh! Silly me.
I am always forgetting things.

525
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,873
Do you know
what else I forgot to do?

526
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:38,096
Give you my phone number.

527
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:40,849
Uh, we really shouldn't
be in here.

528
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:42,768
Mr. Roman doesn't like
people in his office.

529
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,937
I'm sure.
Have you seen his bathroom?

530
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:49,808
Got to go.

531
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,227
Call me.

532
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:02,704
Well, this is awesome.

533
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:03,906
You know what? New plan.

534
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,824
From now on,
we just stay in the van

535
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:08,293
and send in
the 90-pound girl.

536
00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:10,245
Dean, every chomper on earth
knows our face.

537
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:13,048
How many do you think
are in that building?

538
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,617
We wouldn't make it
past the lobby.

539
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:18,086
Yeah, I know.

540
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:19,922
Doesn't mean
I got to be happy

541
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,957
about sending in
freaking Veronica Mars.

542
00:29:23,593 --> 00:29:27,763
She'll be fine...
Or we'll go in.

543
00:29:28,982 --> 00:29:32,768
- We'll get as far as we can.
- Damn right.

544
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:53,455
Hey, guys.

545
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:55,007
Hey.

546
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:57,175
Sending you all
the flagged dig files now.

547
00:29:58,327 --> 00:30:00,829
Charlie,
you are a genius!

548
00:30:00,831 --> 00:30:02,714
I know. It's a problem.

549
00:30:07,336 --> 00:30:09,354
Damn it.

550
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:11,256
Hey, Pete!

551
00:30:11,258 --> 00:30:12,558
Guess we're both on deadline,
huh?

552
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,009
How's it going?

553
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:15,277
Good, good.

554
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,362
I'll give you a full
progress report in a few hours.

555
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:19,147
Great.

556
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:22,017
Hit that deadline,
right?

557
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:25,854
Well, holler
if you need anything.

558
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:33,979
Hey, guys, you still there?

559
00:30:33,981 --> 00:30:35,364
Yeah.
What the hell was that?

560
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,633
Oh, just my manager,
the monster.

561
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,200
Leave.

562
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:41,003
I can't. I got to act normal.

563
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,055
I told him I was working.
Let's just finish this.

564
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:47,326
Are you seeing this?

565
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:50,028
It looks like Dick stopped
digging days ago.

566
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,597
Why?

567
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,632
Guess he found
what he was looking for.

568
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:55,567
- Can you check?
- Way ahead of you.

569
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:59,071
Looking at travel reports,
expenses...

570
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:00,221
Here we go.

571
00:31:00,223 --> 00:31:03,008
Something in his suitcase
left Iran last week.

572
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:07,396
Spent the last 72 hours in
armored cars and private planes.

573
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:12,918
Whatever it is, it's coming here
for Dick tonight.

574
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,236
So, w-what the hell is it?

575
00:31:15,238 --> 00:31:16,872
I don't know. Whatever it is,
he wants it bad,

576
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,674
which means we got to grab it,
end of story.

577
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,676
Well, it's landing at
a private airport near here --

578
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,878
crap -- right about now.

579
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,142
A courier's set
to pick it up.

580
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:25,181
What's the exact
landing time?

581
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:27,115
42 minutes.
Can you make it?

582
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,184
We can try.

583
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:30,752
Uh, all right, Charlie,
one more favor,

584
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:32,253
and then
get the hell out of there.

585
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:34,106
Outstanding.

586
00:31:34,108 --> 00:31:37,476
And you'll call as soon
as the package is in hand?

587
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,729
Absolutely.
I'm here waiting.

588
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:42,864
In fact, I've got time
for a light snack.

589
00:31:55,828 --> 00:31:57,629
Hey, Charlie.

590
00:31:57,631 --> 00:32:01,266
I was hoping
I'd find you here.

591
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:22,705
Hey. Watch it.

592
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:45,411
So now what?

593
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:53,669
I've been looking for this
for a very, very long time.

594
00:33:01,845 --> 00:33:03,412
Now,
who could have done that?

595
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,082
A courier's set to pick it up.

596
00:33:07,084 --> 00:33:08,884
- What's the exact landing time?
- 42 minutes.

597
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,085
Can you make it?
We can try.

598
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:11,354
Uh, all right, Charlie,
one more favor,

599
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,672
and then
get the hell out of there.

600
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:14,857
What do you need?
More time.

601
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,243
Then let's get you some.

602
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,863
Travel department's
e-mailing Dick.

603
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,148
Suitcase still en route,

604
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:25,167
but diverted by weather
and will be 30 minutes late.

605
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:39,949
I'll finish
mopping you guys off the drive

606
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,717
and get the hell out of Dodge.

607
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,102
Call us when you're clear.

608
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,621
Text you from the border,
bro.

609
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:50,593
Hey.

610
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,428
Watch it.

611
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:56,131
Hey.

612
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:20,790
Hey, Charlie.

613
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,059
I was hoping
I'd find you here.

614
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,594
Um, hey, Mr. Roman.

615
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,297
Please. Dick.

616
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:33,302
Pete, we're good here.
Why don't you go grab a bite?

617
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:40,509
Show me what you found.

618
00:34:46,182 --> 00:34:48,033
So now what?

619
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:49,985
See what we've won.

620
00:34:55,692 --> 00:34:58,778
Did we just...steal
a-a hunk of red clay?

621
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,596
That's a good question.

622
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,531
Why don't we answer that a few
thousand miles away from here, though?

623
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,833
Where is Charlie?

624
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:11,424
So there's nothing
about my company?

625
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:12,308
Mnh-mnh.

626
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,960
Ah.
How about a Sam or a Dean?

627
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:16,312
I'm sorry, who?

628
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,180
Sam and Dean Winchester.

629
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,366
Give it a little peek,
would you?

630
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,569
Dick Roman.

631
00:35:26,072 --> 00:35:28,991
Come on.
The girl's right there.

632
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,426
Worry about her.

633
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,912
Is it me, or did it
just drop 10 degrees in here?

634
00:35:32,914 --> 00:35:34,447
It's a bit nippy, yeah.

635
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:36,248
I'll have maintenance
check the A.C.

636
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,367
I can't have you cold,
now, can I?

637
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:42,221
You miserable...

638
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,474
Damn it, Bobby, come on.

639
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,762
Nothing about
those Winchesters.

640
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:52,047
If items were deleted
from the drive,

641
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,066
would you be able
to tell?

642
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,852
Not if they were
deleted properly.

643
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:01,423
Well, they're crafty.

644
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,225
Have all the data
sent to me.

645
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,560
Of course.

646
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:09,915
So, really,
how did you do it?

647
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,433
Uh, do what?

648
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,069
You broke the unbreakable.
What's the thought process?

649
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,738
Walk me through it,
and ix-nay the jargon.

650
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:21,109
Um...nothing's unbreakable,
really.

651
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:23,496
Nothing's safe
if you poke at it long enough.

652
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:25,548
Nothing's safe.
I like that.

653
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,884
But that isn't
what I'm asking, Charlie.

654
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,787
Your spark --
it's one in a million.

655
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,390
Believe me,
but when you got it,

656
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,458
you invent guns and iPads
and viruses,

657
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,410
and, holy crap,
you can be crafty.

658
00:36:38,412 --> 00:36:40,479
- What is that, Charlie?
- Um --

659
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:42,848
'cause I can feed every fact
in your brain to someone else,

660
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,500
they still wouldn't be able
to be you.

661
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,736
I guess
you can't clone me.

662
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,922
Don't think
that doesn't piss me off.

663
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:57,312
Yes.

664
00:36:57,314 --> 00:36:59,615
Fantastic.
Bring it up to my office.

665
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:00,816
I'll be right there.

666
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,702
I think we're on
to something here.

667
00:37:03,704 --> 00:37:07,673
Stay here, will you?
I'll be back in two shakes.

668
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:36,018
Nothing <i>is</i> safe, apparently.

669
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,687
Lock the building down <i>now.</i>

670
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,525
Hold on there, Charlie.

671
00:38:15,078 --> 00:38:17,228
Dean, he's one of them!

672
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:26,421
That would explain it.

673
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:28,573
You're hanging
with the wrong crowd, kiddo.

674
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:35,097
Not so fast, Dick.

675
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:47,909
All right, enough!
Show yourself.

676
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:50,445
Let's do this
like real monsters.

677
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:54,399
Ha, ha, ha!

678
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:58,269
You got to do that again.
That tickled.

679
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:00,706
Dean, come on.
Come on!

680
00:39:07,046 --> 00:39:08,914
Charlie, talk to us.
You okay?

681
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,165
No.

682
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,550
Why didn't you kill him?

683
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:13,284
'Cause we can't yet.

684
00:39:13,286 --> 00:39:14,920
But we will.

685
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:17,990
The really evil ones
always need a special sword.

686
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:22,794
Oh, okay.
I'm gonna pass out now.

687
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:31,302
Because they have it!

688
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:34,906
Now get it back, before they
figure the damn thing out!

689
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:36,858
Please,
sir, d-don't bid me.

690
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,943
Bid you?!

691
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:40,996
Why would I waste
a perfectly good meal?

692
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:54,155
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

693
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:57,522
I left your dumb flask
on the backseat, by the way.

694
00:39:57,524 --> 00:39:59,807
Worst good-luck charm
ever.

695
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,142
Here you go.

696
00:40:01,144 --> 00:40:02,643
Thanks.

697
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:05,730
Listen, um,
we can't thank you enough.

698
00:40:05,732 --> 00:40:07,648
Actually, you can.

699
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,985
Never contact me again,
like, ever. Deal?

700
00:40:10,987 --> 00:40:13,854
Deal.

701
00:40:13,856 --> 00:40:16,474
Keep your head down
out there, okay?

702
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:19,160
This ain't the first time
I've disappeared.

703
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:23,581
You think my name
is really Charlie Bradbury?

704
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,133
Please.

705
00:40:25,135 --> 00:40:28,503
So,
good luck saving the world.

706
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:30,704
Peace out, bitches.

707
00:40:34,126 --> 00:40:36,594
She's kind of like the
little sister I never wanted.

708
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:40,047
We got to talk.

709
00:40:40,049 --> 00:40:43,717
Well, you mean before we get
back to the car and the flask?

710
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,885
Exactly.

711
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:47,071
So, what the hell happened
back in the lobby, Dean?

712
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:48,856
Man, if I had a free shot,

713
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:50,891
I'd have bitch-slapped
the hell out of Dick.

714
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:54,912
Yeah, but, I mean, Charlie
got her freaking arm broken.

715
00:40:54,914 --> 00:40:56,447
He didn't mean to do it.

716
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:57,532
Exactly.

717
00:40:57,534 --> 00:40:59,117
He's not in control,
not about Dick.

718
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,585
That was
vengeful-spirit crap.

719
00:41:00,587 --> 00:41:03,254
I know.
But it's still Bobby.

720
00:41:03,256 --> 00:41:05,706
But if he really goes there,
he won't be anymore,

721
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,875
and then we won't be able
to pull him back.

722
00:41:07,877 --> 00:41:09,289
And then what
are we supposed to do?

723
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,973
I know.

724
00:41:13,923 --> 00:41:16,385
Look, let's just figure out
what that thing we stole is,

725
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,770
and then we'll figure out
what the hell to do with Bobby.

726
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,950
