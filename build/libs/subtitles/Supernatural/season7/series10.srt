1
00:00:02,547 --> 00:00:03,447
Ugh.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,084
Leviathans.

3
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:08,786
They're like shapeshifters,

4
00:00:08,854 --> 00:00:10,287
and nothing can kill 'em.

5
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:12,268
Dick is coming.

6
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:14,122
Well, it's like I always say --

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,686
if you want to win,
then you got to be the shark.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,484
And a shark's got to eat.

9
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,618
You're bibbing me?

10
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:21,991
Bobby, what is it?

11
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:24,729
He's making the doctor
eat himself.

12
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:26,596
They got him.

13
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,427
Dean, there are at least
four Leviathans out there.

14
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:29,894
We don't even know how
to kill one.

15
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:31,193
Well,
it'll be quite a shock

16
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,892
when we walk in through
the front door, won't it?

17
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:37,802
Okay, sons of bitches.

18
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:38,937
See what you're up to now.

19
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,011
Bobby! Come on!

20
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,548
Go! Go!

21
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,917
Hey, Bobby, your hat.

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,520
Oh, God. Bobby?

23
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,322
Bobby?!

24
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:56,323
Bobby?!

25
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,472
Bobby? Bobby?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on.

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,775
- Sam, is he dead?
- I'm checking.

27
00:01:10,843 --> 00:01:12,343
Is he dead?!

28
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:14,545
Just drive, Dean!
Bobby?

29
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:15,453
You got to talk to me,
Sam!

30
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:16,480
All right, he's breathing.
There's a pulse.

31
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:18,495
Keep him upright.
Stop the bleeding.

32
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,449
I'm not an idiot, Dean.

33
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,983
I know first aid for
a friggin' bullet to the head.

34
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,151
- I need the nearest trauma center.
- Hold on. Hold on.

35
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:25,152
What's the address?!

36
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:27,555
All right, Bobby,
hang in there.

37
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,490

00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:43,873
Bobby?
Just hold on.

40
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:05,798
Well,
I guess we found Phil.

41
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:08,801
Wait a minute.

42
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:11,037
Something's not right here.

43
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:13,806
Yeah, no kidding, Bobby.
There's a corpse in a tree.

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,108
Something bad's
about to happen.

45
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:17,509
Yeah, well, danger's
kind of on the W2, Bobby.

46
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:19,311
That's why
we got the guns.

47
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:33,124
Or something bad's
happened already.

48
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:40,765
Balls.

49
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,268
Y-you want to tell us
what's going on?

50
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:44,938
Yeah. What's going on
with your head?

51
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,173
I got shot in it.

52
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:48,474
You what?

53
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,943
Bobby, we've been with you
all day.

54
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:52,347
Yeah, I think we would have
noticed if you took a bullet.

55
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,572
I didn't take one here.

56
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:57,283
I-I took one out there,
I-I-in the real world.

57
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:59,286
You lost us.

58
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:01,588
Look, Bobby, you -- you
want to sit down, seriously?

59
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,090
No, there's something
I got to tell you.

60
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:04,358
I --

61
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,561
damn it,
I can't get at it.

62
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:08,663
Well, I-it's okay. Take your time.
We're -- we're right here.

63
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:10,164
No, no, not <i>you</i> you --

64
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,068
real you, o-out there
in -- in the waking world.

65
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,305
Numbers. Numbers.

66
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:18,472
Where's paper?

67
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:24,778
I didn't have time
before...

68
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:31,618
...to tell you
what they're cooking up.

69
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,186
You need to know.

70
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:38,692
Well, you just gonna stand there
or hand it over, Bobby?

71
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,293
What the hell?

72
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:44,632
Karen?

73
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,134
You were expecting
Farrah Fawcett?

74
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,203
No.
She always calls first.

75
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:54,509
That's what I said
the first time this happened.

76
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,411
What are you
talking about?

77
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,912
Gimme.

78
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:02,817
Oh.

79
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,124
This...

80
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:15,862
This is
just like it was.

81
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,931
You're beautiful.

82
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,766
Quit sweet-talking
and come here.

83
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:25,273
I feel like
we haven't talked in ages.

84
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:27,875
I know
just how you feel.

85
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:30,345
Listen --

86
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:32,480
I have something
I want to say to you.

87
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:36,350
No excuses this time,
okay?

88
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:40,087
Just sit, Bobby.

89
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,561
I know
what night this is.

90
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:49,062
I remember this.

91
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:50,464
I've thought about this
a lot.

92
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,466
I really sat with this.
...Sat with this.

93
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,668
Don't make fun of me.

94
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:57,370
I wouldn't.

95
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,572
But right now
I got to --

96
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:32,141
Mother Mary, I've got
a messed-up fruitcake.

97
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,408
What, Bobby?

98
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:36,645
Nothing.

99
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:40,816
I got to go.
I'm sorry, darling.

100
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,417
Bobby, wait.

101
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:44,519
Don't go.

102
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:47,955
Number-one trick

103
00:05:48,023 --> 00:05:49,857
is to act like you know
what you're doing, Bobby

104
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:51,825
Rufus?

105
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,127
What, I can't give you
advice now?

106
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:54,728
All of a sudden,
you know everything?

107
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:56,193
You know, I can always go
wait in the car.

108
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:59,241
No, wait.
I need your help. Bad

109
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:00,367
Your damn straight, you do.

110
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:02,670
No, listen to me, Rufus.
I'm gonna die.

111
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,071
Oh, now,
that's a realistic view

112
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,672
of the mortality rate
on a ghost hunt.

113
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,775
Whoa!
Whoa, Nellie, red line.

114
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:09,243
All right, baby boy,
here we go.

115
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:11,245
No, Rufus --

116
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:20,455
Are you coming, Bobby?

117
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:22,690
I mean, we're not getting
any younger here.

118
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,192
Coming.

119
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,163
God's gonna punish you.

120
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:21,650
Hello, Mr. Singer.

121
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,054
Your time's up.

122
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:32,003
So you're my reaper,
huh?

123
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,072
You know, I've heard of you guys
grabbing reapees

124
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:39,208
in broad daylight
and in their sleep,

125
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,777
but I never heard of
a reaper showing up

126
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,678
inside a guy's custard.

127
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,681
You're in a coma, genius.
This is what happens.

128
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:52,019
I climb in your...custard
and fish you out.

129
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:55,289
- Oh, you think you can lose me?
- I'm gonna try.

130
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,392
I've got places to be, Singer.
Don't waste my time.

131
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:00,228
Might as well,
while I got it.

132
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:06,201
You're prolonging
the inevitable.

133
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,409
I can find you
anywhere!

134
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:16,412
Even in this
gin-soaked rat maze.

135
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:22,151
I'm just saying --
look, you can't really compare.

136
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,454
There's not even
a contest.

137
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:26,755
It depends
on the criteria.

138
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:28,824
Survival is the only criteria,
all right?

139
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:30,726
And when the crap
hits the fan,

140
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,528
it's not about
who has skill.

141
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:34,730
It's about
who's the bigger badass.

142
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:36,665
Bobby, will you
please tell Sam

143
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:40,335
that Chuck Norris
could kick Jet Li's ass?

144
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,742
Grab me a beer
while you're in there?

145
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,878
Bobby?

146
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,748
Bobby Singer, you had better be
washed up when you come down.

147
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:57,953
You're filthy.

148
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:00,456
God, what
is wrong with you?

149
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,859
It's like
you <i>want</i> him to get mad.

150
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:08,999
Whew! Poor thing.

151
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,102
Gets left at the altar,
kills herself,

152
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,071
and then gets buried
in the crypt.

153
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:15,907
Now she's going after men
who break their girls' hearts.

154
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:18,076
Poignant,
am I wrong?

155
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:19,378
Why you out of breath?

156
00:09:19,412 --> 00:09:21,280
Did you go for a jog
up there, man?

157
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:22,314
- I need your help, Rufus.
- Yeah, clearly.

158
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:24,082
No, listen to me.

159
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:25,718
I want you to grab
a torch, man.

160
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:28,787
As soon as I open up her coffin,
showtime's coming pretty quick.

161
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:30,789
No. Will you listen to me,
you son of a bitch?

162
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:32,491
There's a damn reaper
coming for me.

163
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:34,727
There's a damn reaper coming
for all of us, Bobby.

164
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:39,998
All right, let's put
this damn ghost to bed.

165
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,735
I got plans for Purim.

166
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:46,906
Page the neurosurgeon
on call.

167
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,641
Tell O.R.
to put electives on hold.

168
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:52,112
Move trauma 2 to bed 7
as soon as it's clean.

169
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:54,314
Gunshot wound to the right frontal area
no exit wound found.

170
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:57,351
Breathing spontaneously.
Respiratory rate 18 and shallow.

171
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:00,020
RST at 120.
B.P. 90 over 60.

172
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:02,422
- GCS 5.
- Push 80 grams of mannitol over 30.

173
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,525
- Prep for intubation.
- Air entry clear to bases.

174
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,786
Let's get a central line
in here now.

175
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:06,927
What's happening?
Please just tell us --

176
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:08,628
- Get them out of here.
- Sorry. You need to stay out of their way.

177
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:10,330
- That's our Uncle.
- You got to stay back.

178
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:11,932
- What are they doing?
- We need to get him stable.

179
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,133
Okay, when are you gonna take
the bullet out?

180
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,168
If we can get
the swelling down,

181
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,737
if it's in a place
we can get to, if --

182
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,338
If he even lives
that long.

183
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,682
Forget it.
I got to keep moving.

184
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:31,752
Heartbreaker.

185
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,259
Push 30 more
of mannitol over 10.

186
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:42,796
CBC and 'lytes.
Bolus him with 500 saline.

187
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,581
The vitals were stable
two minutes ago.

188
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:47,417
Well, he's crashing now.

189
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:51,805
I'll break <i>your</i> heart.

190
00:10:57,311 --> 00:10:58,628
Bobby...

191
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,014
Come on. You okay?
Say something.

192
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,817
Look out!

193
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,369
Blood pressure
130 over 90.

194
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:37,217
Okay, Rufus, I need you --

195
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:39,169
oh, balls.

196
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,687
This <i>would</i> be the one job

197
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:43,190
you damn near got yourself
killed on.

198
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:47,477
Well, you're gonna be useful,
even if I have to carry you.

199
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:53,533
He's, uh, stable
for the moment.

200
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:55,619
Just have to see.

201
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:21,228
Rufus...

202
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:23,013
Where the hell
did you go?

203
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:25,982
Hey!

204
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,984
Yeah, you!
You, kid!

205
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:29,770
Hey, what are you making
like a white rabbit

206
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:32,739
all over the place for,
you grubby little --

207
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:35,225
enough with the jump scares,
kid.

208
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,860
Who are you running from?

209
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:42,532
Wait a minute.
I know you.

210
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:47,921
Did you think I was dead?

211
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:49,372
Call me, all right?

212
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:52,242
Don't sit Shiva for me yet,
Bobby.

213
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:55,879
Listen -- after bridezilla
took you out,

214
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,431
do you remember what you told me
about your near-death experience?

215
00:12:58,516 --> 00:12:59,783
I haven't told you
nothing yet.

216
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,084
But now
that you mention it,

217
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:02,686
pretty sure
I almost crossed over.

218
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:04,337
And what did you see?

219
00:13:04,405 --> 00:13:08,158
What did I see? What are you
so riled up about, paco?

220
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:09,776
All right, all right.

221
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:12,062
I saw a hallway,
uh, plaid carpet,

222
00:13:12,113 --> 00:13:13,960
uh, the apartment building
from when I was a kid.

223
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:14,764
And?

224
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:16,566
And I wanted out.

225
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:18,485
I'm not dying
on no damn plaid carpet.

226
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:20,320
No, thank you.
So, what did you do?

227
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:22,789
Well, obviously, Bobby,
not being stupid,

228
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:25,208
I started looking
for the damn exit door.

229
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:27,127
Y-you know, I swear
that's what they mean

230
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:29,162
about your life
flashing before your eyes,

231
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:30,580
'cause every time
I opened the door,

232
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:31,965
there was another chapter
inside --

233
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,449
the good, the bad,
the bloody.

234
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:34,968
So, how did you get out?

235
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:36,553
Found the right door,
obviously.

236
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,221
Well,
how did you find it?

237
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:40,456
- Oh, simple -- I went deep.
- Deep. Like old?

238
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:42,676
No, deep like...

239
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,961
Crap you do not
want to think about,

240
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:48,265
so you bury it,
you shove other crap over it,

241
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:51,401
and you don't go there,
ever.

242
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:53,270
So, you're telling me

243
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:56,806
that the way out was
through your worst memory?

244
00:13:56,858 --> 00:13:58,491
It's an important door,
Bobby.

245
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,410
Okay, this is good.

246
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:01,848
What the hell are you
going on about, anyway?

247
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:03,073
This.

248
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:06,116
I got to find the right door
to get this to Sam and Dean.

249
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:10,287
I'm in a coma, Rufus,
right now.

250
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:12,923
Get out.

251
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,491
I got shot in the dunce cap,
Rufus.

252
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:18,044
I'm -- I'm dying.

253
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,379
You sure?

254
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:20,881
Unfortunately.

255
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:24,301
I'll be a prima ballerina.

256
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:27,270
Wait, wait, Bobby.
Are you trying to tell me

257
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:28,838
I'm just one
of your better memories?

258
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,106
Would I make this up?

259
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,978
- Okay. I got to go.
- What?

260
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:36,313
- You're coming with me, Rufus.
- What?

261
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:37,564
I need my partner
on this.

262
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:41,902
Please.

263
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:46,623
Aim for
your worst memory.

264
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,909
Think. Focus.

265
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:51,494
You got it?
The worst, okay?

266
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:53,713
I got a metric ton
of worst.

267
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:56,699
Just take a shot.

268
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,551
By the way,
killer bride --

269
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,587
how come she call you
a heartbreaker, anyway?

270
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:03,974
I mean, you a family man
if I ever saw one.

271
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,227
Thanks for narrowing
things down.

272
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:17,053
I can't believe you.

273
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,690
I hate you.

274
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:26,279
Everything's a lie.

275
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:29,282
Our whole life...

276
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:31,668
Our vows...

277
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:34,287
Everything.

278
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:37,123
You knew
I wanted kids.

279
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,843
Why didn't you just...

280
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,846
Sit me down and say...

281
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:47,717
I don't understand.

282
00:15:47,768 --> 00:15:51,254
You're a good man.

283
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:53,556
You'd be a good dad.

284
00:15:57,194 --> 00:15:59,813
What does that
even mean,

285
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:01,898
you break
everything you touch?!

286
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:04,600
What kind of excuse
is that?!

287
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:06,069
Aah!

288
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:08,938
Just stay away from me!

289
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,109
You broke my heart,
Bobby!

290
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,611
You happy?

291
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:19,716
Just go away!

292
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:29,342
Just so you know...
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:33,463
I never stopped
being sorry.

294
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:38,268
Bobby, I thought
you'd want a gang of rugrats.

295
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:44,574
So, how long
after this --

296
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:46,026
did she get possessed?

297
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,967
Three days.

298
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:01,708
Biggest regret of my life,
this fight.

299
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:08,848
You'd think it was
when I had to stab her to death,

300
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:12,302
but...No.

301
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:16,005
All through that...

302
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:18,558
I was thinking

303
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:22,262
we never
got to get past this.

304
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:33,656
If I'd have known,

305
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:37,961
I'd have said
anything she wanted to hear.

306
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:43,466
Bobby?

307
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:45,418
Hey.

308
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:47,420
Try the door.

309
00:17:49,974 --> 00:17:51,674
Now.

310
00:17:57,681 --> 00:17:59,816
Thanks, Rufus.

311
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,097
Balls.

312
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,685
What year is this?

313
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:26,053
'89-ish?

314
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:27,420
What's it matter?

315
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:30,107
I'm still stuck
in eternal friggin' sunshine.

316
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:33,727
No, I was just thinking, man --
you look pretty good there.

317
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:35,629
Must have drank less.

318
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,065
Hey, Bobby,
where are we going?

319
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,534
Well, Dean,
where's it look like?

320
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:44,288
Dad says I'm supposed to
practice with the double-barrel.

321
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:47,157
Well, we're gonna skip
the guns today. Here.

322
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,276
Today...

323
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:52,279
You're gonna throw
a ball around,

324
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:55,866
just like a regular
snot-nosed little jerk.

325
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,248
You know, for a guy
who'd rather break his wife's

326
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,473
heart than give her a baby,

327
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,175
you make
a hell of a nanny.

328
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,426
Shut up, Rufus.

329
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:09,129
We need another door.

330
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,937
Let's go.

331
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:18,855
Seriously, though, Bobby,
how come --

332
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,190
Dog with a bone,
Rufus.

333
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,442
No, I really want to know,
man -- why no kids?

334
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:23,694
Ain't that deep.

335
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:25,279
Dad was a mean drunk.

336
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,497
I figured
I'd be just like him.

337
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:29,366
And, hey, look --
I was right.

338
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,285
No sense
passing on the legacy.

339
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,337
Man, you're too hard
on yourself.

340
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,872
You're more
of a cranky drunk.

341
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,791
You do know that whatever
you're trying to avoid

342
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,593
with the eye rolls
and the grump-a-lumping --

343
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,128
that's exactly
where you need to go.

344
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,629
- I ain't avoiding nothing.
- Yeah, sure.

345
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,214
Get off my ass, Rufus.

346
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:47,351
Hey, Bobby, I'm trying
to help you here, okay?

347
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:48,653
You want to get out of here,
or you want to die?

348
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:49,878
I'm trying.

349
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,556
How am I supposed to know
what I don't want me to know?

350
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,375
Hey, look.

351
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,827
The crown prince decided
to drop by for a late bite.

352
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:16,763
Oh, he --
he was just washing up.

353
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:20,884
So, w-who would like
to say grace?

354
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,971
Hell with grace.
Pass me the biscuits.

355
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,551
- I'm sorry.
- What is the matter with you?

356
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:40,887
- I don't know. I'm sorry.
- You break everything you touch!

357
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:43,423
Let's just have
a nice supper.

358
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:44,908
A nice supper?

359
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,110
Mm-hmm.

360
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,198
There's your nice supper.

361
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,457
I get no respect
in this house.

362
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,557
What?

363
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:18,925
Now, you can't tell me

364
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,477
that wasn't gnarly enough
to go spelunking in.

365
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,279
That was
any given Tuesday night.

366
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:24,481
Believe me --
it was nothing special.

367
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:26,483
- No, no, no. You're scared.
- No, I ain't.

368
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,735
I just know
we're in the wrong place, Rufus.

369
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:30,603
You --

370
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:33,490
Okay, Bobby,
you don't have time.

371
00:21:33,574 --> 00:21:35,292
That sound was not the weather,
and you know it.

372
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,777
We can't keep bopping through
your greatest hits forever.

373
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,130
That reaper's
gonna catch up.

374
00:21:40,214 --> 00:21:44,000
I mean, if there was some way
to stop the damn thing...

375
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:47,087
But it's a reaper, Bobby.
You're screwed.

376
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:49,840
I know
what we're gonna do.

377
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:51,591
What?

378
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,410
We're gonna stop
the damn reaper.

379
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,628
So, there's
nothing else we can do?

380
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,464
I'm sorry.
We just have to wait.

381
00:21:57,515 --> 00:21:59,399
- We'll see if the swelling goes down.
- How long?

382
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:01,017
It's hard to say
in cases like this.

383
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:03,687
Well, he's lasted this long.
That's something, right?

384
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:05,272
Well, yes.

385
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,741
Listen --
the bullet didn't shatter.

386
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:09,609
Only one hemisphere of his brain
was injured.

387
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,162
These are
all positive things.

388
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:15,248
But...I don't want to give you
false hope here.

389
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:17,617
He's far
from out of the woods.

390
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:19,469
Most of the time,
cases like this...

391
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:22,089
They die.

392
00:22:25,793 --> 00:22:27,127
Right now
it comes down to him.

393
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:29,379
I'll keep you updated.

394
00:22:35,603 --> 00:22:37,938
Excuse me.

395
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:40,340
Sorry to interrupt.

396
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:42,509
Is one of you
Robert Singer's next of kin?

397
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:46,813
We know
this is a stressful time.

398
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:49,032
Yeah, okay. No offense --
you can skip the garnish.

399
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,817
What, did his insurance lapse,
or what?

400
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:52,352
We're sorry to ask,

401
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:55,522
but, um, did your uncle
ever make his wishes known

402
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:58,792
I-in regards
to organ donation?

403
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:02,529
Organs are only viable
for a very limited window --

404
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,047
"viable"?

405
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,134
We're just hoping some good
can come of this tragic --

406
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:08,468
Listen to me.
I'm gonna say this once.

407
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,889
He's not gonna die.
It's one bullet.

408
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,226
He's gonna be fine
because he's always fine.

409
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,561
I apologize.

410
00:23:17,645 --> 00:23:20,880
Why are you talking to me
like he's gonna die, huh?

411
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,483
I do my job!
Do your jobs! Save him!

412
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:25,485
Of course they're doing
everything they can.

413
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,107
Walk away from me.

414
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:33,443
Now!

415
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,693
Dick!
I know you're in there.

416
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,762
Come on out, you dick.

417
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:12,732
What, did you come here
to finish the job?

418
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,318
Yeah? Well, come on.

419
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:16,953
Right here, right now,

420
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,372
out in the open,
you and me, Dick Roman.

421
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,992
See?

422
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:24,744
Deciding to jump a famous guy
ain't all upside.

423
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:28,331
You can kill me right now --
you want to see it online.

424
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:32,002
Maybe you should go check
on that friend of yours.

425
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:34,387
He can't be feeling too frisky
right about now.

426
00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:35,455
I'm a very good shot.

427
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,627
We're coming for you,

428
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:42,846
and not just to hurt you --
to kill you.

429
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,564
You understand me?

430
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:46,316
Come on, Dean.
I can't be killed.

431
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,801
You're gonna wish
you could, then.

432
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:50,654
That's some conviction.

433
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:53,306
You'd really crush it
on the motivational circuit.

434
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:54,641
You're either laughing
because you're scared

435
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:55,759
or you're laughing
because you're stupid.

436
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,413
I'll see you soon,
dick.

437
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,928
It's in
an old King James Bible.

438
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:22,385
So, what exactly
are we doing now, Bobby?

439
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:30,510
Well, technically,
you're correct.

440
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:34,347
You can't stop a reaper,
not permanently.

441
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:36,950
Only their boss can do that,
and we don't want him involved.

442
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:40,787
Ah.

443
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:43,189
Now we're cooking
with gas.

444
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:50,697
What is that?
Well, Sam and Dean

445
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:53,166
have run up against these
suckers a couple, three times.

446
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:55,168
Picked up a few tricks --

447
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:58,755
enough to slow them down
a hair, at least.

448
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:01,558
All right.
Let's work some mojo.

449
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:05,061
<i>Dr. Flores, dial 118, please.</i>

450
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:09,065
<i>Dr. Flores, please dial 118.</i>

451
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,563
<i>Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor</i>
<i>in the main lobby.</i>

452
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:25,398
<i>Dr. Kravitz, a visitor...</i>

453
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,283
- What did that guy want?
- Uh, nothing.

454
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:29,869
Just some insurance mook.

455
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,454
Dick Roman was out there.

456
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:33,540
What?
What happened?

457
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,709
Nothing...For now.

458
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,745
It was just a friggin'
staring contest.

459
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:40,380
That was about it.

460
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:41,381
What's the update?

461
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,852
The swelling's down
a little.

462
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,854
They took him
off sedation.

463
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:49,939
Apparently, he -- he
started fighting his tube.

464
00:26:50,024 --> 00:26:51,975
So they pulled them out,
and he's breathing on his own.

465
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:54,411
That's good, right?
Is that good?

466
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:58,097
Yeah. Well, doctor said
best-case scenario.

467
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:01,151
All right, so when
they gonna take the bullet out?

468
00:27:01,235 --> 00:27:03,453
Dean,
t-they're not even --

469
00:27:03,537 --> 00:27:05,872
they're not even gonna try that,
not yet.

470
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:08,074
What does that mean?

471
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,076
The word's "abrading,"
I think.

472
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:11,378
English.

473
00:27:11,445 --> 00:27:12,512
Cutting out
the dead brain tissue.

474
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:17,450
That's if the doctor even thinks
it's worth the risk.

475
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:21,471
Can I talk to you?

476
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:30,563
What?
Talk about what?

477
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:33,299
You know what.

478
00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:37,312
No, we're not gonna have
that conversation.

479
00:27:37,337 --> 00:27:38,354
Oh, we need to.

480
00:27:38,355 --> 00:27:39,689
- He's not gonna die.
- He might.

481
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:41,324
Sam.
Dean, listen --

482
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,826
we need to brace
ourselves.

483
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,360
- Why?
- Because it's real.

484
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:48,832
What do you want to do?

485
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,725
You want to hug and --
and say we made it

486
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,950
through it when dad died?

487
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,089
We've been through
enough.

488
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:47,039
We still need gold ore,
hemlock, and mace.

489
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:49,642
Mm. So, pretty basic,
then, huh?

490
00:28:58,602 --> 00:29:02,071
No, we didn't shoot rifles,
as a matter of fact.

491
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:03,673
We threw a ball around.

492
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:08,444
He's a kid, John.
They both are.

493
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,029
They're entitled.

494
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:14,734
Yeah, I know
I ain't their dad.

495
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,215
What the hell?

496
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:53,940
<i>O theristes,</i>
<i>kaleo se Kai deo.</i>

497
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:01,631
Cute.

498
00:30:01,715 --> 00:30:04,217
Got to admit --

499
00:30:04,284 --> 00:30:06,669
first time anyone's
pulled one on me

500
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:08,471
while actually unconscious.

501
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,890
Well, get comfy.

502
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,141
Not so fast.

503
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:13,593
Yeah?

504
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:15,979
Sorry.
Other business.

505
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:18,715
I'm trying to help you,
Bobby.

506
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:20,066
You're going to die.

507
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:22,268
Think you can stop it
by pinning me like a bug?

508
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:25,738
Well --

509
00:30:25,806 --> 00:30:28,541
you've seen
the dark coming --

510
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:32,912
people disappearing,
things going blank.

511
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,364
Look around.

512
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:40,036
Cell by cell...

513
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,873
that bullet's
killing your brain.

514
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,175
You're running out
of places to hide.

515
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,929
So, understand --
this trap won't hold forever

516
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:52,432
because
this room won't hold

517
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:56,052
because
you are going to die.

518
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,937
You think.

519
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:03,493
Come with me.

520
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,895
Be done.

521
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,363
You've earned it.

522
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,568
Or fight me.

523
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:13,803
Stay here.

524
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,290
And you know the drill.

525
00:31:20,694 --> 00:31:22,495
I don't know, Bobby.

526
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:25,798
I mean, you really
want to get stuck,

527
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:27,583
turn into some ghost?

528
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:29,085
I know
what I'm doing, Rufus.

529
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,804
Yeah, yeah, you're thinking
you can help those boys.

530
00:31:31,872 --> 00:31:34,173
But how many spirits you meet
in their right mind?

531
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,310
Some hunter's
gonna cut you down.

532
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:38,578
Whose side
are you on?

533
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,046
Bobby...

534
00:31:40,114 --> 00:31:42,181
You've helped.

535
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:46,619
You got handed
a small, unremarkable life,

536
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,988
and you did something
with it.

537
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:51,574
Most men like you die
of liver disease,

538
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,728
watching
"Barney Miller" reruns.

539
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:58,281
You've done enough.

540
00:31:58,365 --> 00:31:59,966
Believe me.

541
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:04,170
- I don't care.
- Why?

542
00:32:04,237 --> 00:32:06,039
Because
they're my boys.

543
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:13,613
All right.

544
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,765
The only way out
is through.

545
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:21,938
So lead the way.

546
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:24,974
Nice seeing you again,
old friend.

547
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,594
Thanks for the chat.

548
00:32:35,732 --> 00:32:38,059
It's fine.
It'll just take a second.

549
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,952
You just
gonna sit there?

550
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:47,588
Get a broom
or somethin'.

551
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:52,810
You know
why he's like that?

552
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:57,297
Because you let him do
whatever he wants.

553
00:32:57,349 --> 00:32:59,400
It's okay.
See? I'm almost done.

554
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:01,735
You just relax
a-and have another drink.

555
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:06,407
Don't tell me
what to do.

556
00:33:07,492 --> 00:33:09,326
No. Wait.

557
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:10,778
Wait.

558
00:33:10,845 --> 00:33:11,912
I-- no!

559
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:18,102
Why do you
always provoke him?

560
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:20,187
Because he's a bad kid --

561
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:21,989
that's why.

562
00:33:24,092 --> 00:33:26,377
Well,
that's a load of crap.

563
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:28,662
Who the hell
were <i>you</i> to say?

564
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:29,763
I'm your father.

565
00:33:29,831 --> 00:33:32,716
And you show your father
respect.

566
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:36,470
The day he deserves it,
you drunken bully.

567
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:37,688
Punching women and kids --

568
00:33:37,772 --> 00:33:39,790
is that what they call
fatherhood in your day?

569
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:41,959
Oh, you deserved it.
Believe me.

570
00:33:42,027 --> 00:33:43,944
You were nothing
but ungrateful.

571
00:33:44,012 --> 00:33:46,179
I was a kid!

572
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:47,982
Kids ain't supposed to be
grateful!

573
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:50,534
They're supposed to eat
your food and break your heart,

574
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,252
you selfish dick!

575
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,789
You died,
and I was still so afraid

576
00:33:55,857 --> 00:33:58,459
I'd turn into you
I never even had kids of my own.

577
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:00,377
Good.

578
00:34:00,462 --> 00:34:02,329
You break
everything you touch.

579
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,999
Uh-huh.

580
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,051
Well,
as fate would have it,

581
00:34:07,135 --> 00:34:11,588
I adopted two boys,
and they grew up great.

582
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:14,374
They grew up heroes.

583
00:34:14,426 --> 00:34:17,478
So you can go to hell!

584
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:19,680
Keep the head of the bed up
for transport.

585
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:22,049
I.V. can run off the pump.
Just run a TKVO.

586
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,698
- We'll have to wait for respiratory.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

587
00:34:24,235 --> 00:34:26,570
- What's happening?
- He's showing signs of responsiveness.

588
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:28,238
We're taking him up
for surgery.

589
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:30,557
If you want to see him,
I'd squeeze in there quick.

590
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:36,947
I'm sorry.
I said that I'm -- I'm sorry.

591
00:34:37,032 --> 00:34:38,082
Yeah, yeah,
you say that every time.

592
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,950
Please just stop.

593
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:41,618
No!
This time, you listen!

594
00:34:41,686 --> 00:34:44,237
Stop it.

595
00:34:51,513 --> 00:34:52,730
You're kidding, right?

596
00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:57,017
You're not half enough man
to use that thing.

597
00:34:57,085 --> 00:35:00,420
You leave the adults
to sort this out...

598
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:04,274
And I will deal with you
later.

599
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:06,026
Ohh! Aah!
Bobby, just go.

600
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:07,311
Do what he says.
Just go.

601
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:08,946
No.
Leave her alone.

602
00:35:10,148 --> 00:35:11,065
Aah!

603
00:35:24,295 --> 00:35:28,432
Bobby,
what did you do?

604
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,301
God is gonna punish you.

605
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:34,304
Hey.

606
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,142
You did
what you had to do.

607
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:42,679
This is where you learn
that...

608
00:35:42,764 --> 00:35:45,215
They pretty much never say
thanks when you save 'em.

609
00:35:48,153 --> 00:35:50,303
Now go get a shovel.

610
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:52,790
Bury the old man
out behind the woodshed.

611
00:35:56,978 --> 00:36:00,447
You got the only genetic case
of bullet in the brain

612
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:02,032
I've ever seen.

613
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:06,503
Not so fast, Singer.

614
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:20,050
Sorry.
We need to get moving.

615
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:23,020
Right.
Yeah.

616
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:25,889
Hey, um...

617
00:36:25,974 --> 00:36:29,109
Bobby, um...

618
00:36:30,862 --> 00:36:33,113
...Just...Thanks...

619
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:37,434
...For everything.

620
00:36:40,371 --> 00:36:43,457
- All right. Please step back.
- Yeah.

621
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:48,295
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop. His eyes are open.

622
00:36:49,998 --> 00:36:51,081
Bobby?
Hey.

623
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,171
What --

624
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:02,059
don't talk.
Don't talk.

625
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:05,345
A pen -- I --
here. Here, here, here.

626
00:37:05,396 --> 00:37:06,597
What is it?

627
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:34,124
Idjits.

628
00:37:43,084 --> 00:37:44,184
Bobby?

629
00:37:44,252 --> 00:37:46,220
Hey!

630
00:37:57,721 --> 00:37:59,288
Call a code --
trauma room.

631
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:41,597
You microbrewing in there,
or what?

632
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,632
Come on -- we got a lot
of Chuck Norris to get through.

633
00:38:43,683 --> 00:38:44,633
Let's go.

634
00:38:52,642 --> 00:38:54,960
Nice move,
waking up like that.

635
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:57,646
Motivation's a mother.

636
00:38:57,714 --> 00:39:01,100
You know why it's dark
out there, don't you?

637
00:39:03,086 --> 00:39:07,022
This house --
it's your last island,

638
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:10,025
everything else melted
by that bullet --

639
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:13,128
gone.

640
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:18,701
This is your last chance
to come with me and move on.

641
00:39:18,768 --> 00:39:23,455
For your own good, Bobby,
let go.

642
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:29,645
They'll be okay
without you.

643
00:39:36,386 --> 00:39:38,153
Last memory, huh?

644
00:39:43,193 --> 00:39:45,744
Glad I saved the best
for last.

645
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:52,584
All right, scoot, jerkface.
Show your elders some respect.

646
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:55,070
You scoot, ass-hat.

647
00:39:57,257 --> 00:39:58,707
Mm.

648
00:40:01,294 --> 00:40:02,577
Did we get licorice?

649
00:40:02,629 --> 00:40:05,164
No, we did not get
licorice.

650
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:07,516
We got <i>good</i> snacks.
Licorice is disgusting.

651
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:09,418
I'm sorry.
I didn't quite understand that,

652
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:11,303
uh, Mr. peanut-butter-and-banana
sandwiches?

653
00:40:11,388 --> 00:40:12,971
You know what?
I stand by that sandwich.

654
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,607
Nobody likes licorice.
I-it's -- it's made of dirt.

655
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:17,226
It is a classic
movie food.

656
00:40:17,277 --> 00:40:18,894
It's right up there
with popcorn.

657
00:40:18,945 --> 00:40:19,862
Popcorn? Really?
Yes.

658
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:21,113
You're out of your mind.

659
00:40:21,197 --> 00:40:23,182
What -- it's like little
chewy pieces of heaven.

660
00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:24,950
Oh, chewy pieces of heaven
if you're a girl.

661
00:40:29,572 --> 00:40:31,874
Well, Bobby?

662
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,945
Stay or go --
what's it gonna be?

663
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:52,987
