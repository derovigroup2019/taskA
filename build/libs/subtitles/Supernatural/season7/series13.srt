00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,708
Bobby. Bobby!

2
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:09,631
Gunshot wound to
the right frontal area.

3
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:10,856
No exit wound found.

4
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:13,015
Hello, Mr. Singer.

5
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:15,485
Your time's up.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,524
Idjits.

7
00:00:24,396 --> 00:00:25,229
Bobby?

8
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:27,364
Hey!

9
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:29,132
What's it gonna be?

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,967
Stay or go?

11
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:32,001
You lied to me.

12
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:33,069
And you killed my friend.

13
00:00:33,137 --> 00:00:35,282
Killing Amy was not wrong.

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,028
You couldn't do it,
so I did.

15
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:38,563
Tell you the truth,

16
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:40,526
I don't know why I'm doing
much of anything anymore.

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,413
Here's my advice
you didn't ask for -- quit.

18
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,573
What?!

19
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:44,886
It's not even an option.

20
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:46,375
I'm not gonna walk out
on my brother.

21
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:47,748
Do what I did.

22
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:50,253
Decide to be fine
until the end of the week.

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,135
Make yourself smile
because you're alive

24
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:54,784
and that's your job.

25
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:57,028
And do it again
the next week.

26
00:00:57,095 --> 00:00:58,608
Do it right...

27
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:00,164
with a smile.

28
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:01,742
Or don't do it.

29
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:12,944
? <i>...and I don't need</i>
<i>no pills</i> ?

30
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:16,644
? <i>and I don't need no doctor</i>
<i>to tell me how I feel</i> ?

31
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:23,564
? <i>all right,</i>
<i>you can keep the bill</i> ?

32
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:25,378
? <i>I've been drinking poison</i>
<i>and hoping you'd fall ill</i> ?

33
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:31,047
Barb, that you?

34
00:01:31,114 --> 00:01:35,105
? <i>So maybe I'm an angel,</i>
<i>and maybe I'm a thief</i> ?

35
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,562
? <i>maybe I'm a beggar that</i>
<i>you walk by on the street</i> ?

36
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,935
? <i>all right</i> ?

37
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,825
? <i>You cut off both my wings</i> ?

40
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:05,363
Morning.

41
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,436
Hey.

42
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:12,352
Was that Bobby's?

43
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:14,627
I didn't know
you kept that.

44
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:16,349
Yeah, mine sprung a leak.

45
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:19,392
You know, most people
would just carry a --

46
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,598
a photo or something
for a memento.

47
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,507
- Shut up, man.
- I'm -- I'm honoring the guy.

48
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:26,010
All right?

49
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,515
This is, uh,
grief therapy.

50
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,588
Kind of like you
and your wild-goose chase.

51
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:30,557
Wild-goose chase?

52
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,661
Yeah.

53
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,633
Four guys murdered
in two weeks,

54
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,103
hands and feet cut off.

55
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:37,777
Well, some guy
with a foot fetish run amuck.

56
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:40,451
Grown men thrown so hard
they went through walls.

57
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,727
Did you -- did you even read
the article?

58
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:45,966
No, I was napping.

59
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:48,005
Well, anyway...

60
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:49,344
What else
you got going on?

61
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:50,480
Dick Roman's a dead end for now.
We might as well...

62
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:51,080
Stay busy.

63
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,619
Exactly.

64
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:54,257
Yeah.

65
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:01,308
The latest
but probably not the last.

66
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:07,255
You guys
always work this late?

67
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:08,391
Ugh. Hours suck.

68
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,462
Yeah, but great
benefits package.

69
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,932
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,505
- 10% co-pay on all drugs.
- Seriously?

71
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,608
Oh, but just generic,
right?

72
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:16,310
No, no,
name brands are cool.

73
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:17,279
Huh.

74
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:18,815
Yeah.
So...

75
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,320
What's our boy
here weigh?

76
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:21,956
A buck 90.

77
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:23,794
Thrown against a wall so hard
it buckled.

78
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:26,197
Based on the blood flow
at the crime scene,

79
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:27,664
the hands and feet were cut off
while he was still alive,

80
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:28,764
just like the others.

81
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:29,932
The killer wanted him
to suffer.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,599
And all the vics were male,
right?

83
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,834
With the, uh, same kind
of artwork as this?

84
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:35,601
Yeah. Identical.

85
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,836
So, uh, DNA left
at any of the scenes?

86
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:39,237
All of them.

87
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:40,771
One before this,
the guy <i>bit</i> the attacker.

88
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,672
Still had a chunk of flesh
in his teeth when he came in.

89
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,940
That's about as good
as it gets.

90
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:45,074
Right.

91
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,875
- So, we have a match?
- We do not.

92
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:49,277
Samples were rejected.

93
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:51,679
The genetic markers don't match
anything we've ever seen.

94
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:53,313
Didn't match any person
in the database?

95
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:55,048
No. I mean, they don't match
anything human.

96
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:58,217
Hmm.

97
00:04:58,285 --> 00:05:00,953
I'll admit, it could be
in the general vicinity

98
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:03,188
of the ballpark
of our kind of thing.

99
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:05,524
Yeah, uh, "didn't match
anything human"

100
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:07,325
usually seals the deal
for me.

101
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:08,526
I don't know.

102
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:09,560
I've never seen
this symbol before.

103
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:11,261
Let's get a bite to eat,

104
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:12,562
go back to the motel,
haul out the laptop.

105
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,662
That's a great idea.

106
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,296
Actually,
that's a brilliant idea.

107
00:05:15,364 --> 00:05:16,431
Here's my counter.

108
00:05:16,498 --> 00:05:17,831
You do that,

109
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,499
I'll go undercover,
go mingle amongst the locals,

110
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,834
and see what kind of clues
bubble to the surface.

111
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,402
You're going to a bar.

112
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,037
Wow.

113
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:29,440
If you want to
oversimplify it.

114
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:39,048
Dinner and a movie.

115
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:41,017
Which sounded fine...

116
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:43,452
Except the movie was
"Human Centipede."

117
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,122
Well, so, wait. Uh,
so you had a problem with that?

118
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,656
The date from hell.

119
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,624
Dating, right? Ugh.

120
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,893
But what's the option?

121
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,795
I don't see settling down
anytime soon.

122
00:05:57,865 --> 00:05:59,532
Well, that's something
you don't hear every day.

123
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:00,966
Oh, what?

124
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:03,101
Are you ready
for the big commit?

125
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:03,801
Me?

126
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:07,805
Not exactly.

127
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,142
Nice suit, by the way.

128
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,845
Guys don't dress up much.

129
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:17,213
I like it.

130
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,582
Yeah, well, it's, uh,
a conservative line of work.

131
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,050
What line is that?

132
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:24,085
Investment banking.

133
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:25,653
Oh, God.
Thanks.

134
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:26,821
I hear the hours
are ridic.

135
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,088
Yeah.

136
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:29,923
But there's money
to be made.

137
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,829
I've had a fortunate year.

138
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,667
Well...

139
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:45,235
...may you have many more.

140
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:49,305
Arigatou.

141
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:50,874
You speak Japanese?

142
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:51,941
Ah, enough to get by.

143
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:55,277
Well...

144
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:57,213
Look at you.

145
00:06:57,281 --> 00:06:58,847
Yeah, look at me.

146
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:03,818
So...

147
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:07,387
You want to move
this conversation elsewhere?

148
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:10,189
[ AC/DC's "You Shook Me
All Night Long" plays ]

149
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,567
? She was a fast machine ?

150
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:26,669
? she kept her motor clean ?

151
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,272
? she was the best damn woman
that I ever seen ?

152
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,607
? she had the sightless eyes ?
hi.

153
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:34,009
? Telling me no lies ?
what can I do for you?

154
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:38,413
? Knocking me out
with those American thighs ?

155
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,747
? taking more than her share ?

156
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:42,382
? had me fighting for air ?

157
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:45,750
? she told me to come,
but I was already there ?

158
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:47,785
? 'cause the walls
start shaking ?

159
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:49,487
? the earth was quaking ?

160
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:51,622
? my mind was aching ?

161
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:53,723
? and we were making it ?

162
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,759
? and you shook me
all night long ?

163
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,531
? Yeah, you ?

164
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,034
? shook me all night long ?

165
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,505
? Oh, oh, oh, you ?

166
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:13,442
? shook me all night long ?

167
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:17,079
? yeah, yeah, you ?

168
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:21,116
? shook me all night long ?

169
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,518
? yeah, you shook me ?

170
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,655
? all night long ?

171
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:30,690
Ugh.

172
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:31,858
You look like crap.

173
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:33,826
Yeah, well,
I feel worse than I look.

174
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:35,727
I do recommend the Cobalt Room,
by the way.

175
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:37,028
Awesome night.

176
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:39,263
Although I think
I'm getting too old for this.

177
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:41,365
Did you, uh,
figure out that symbol?

178
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:44,000
No. Um,
we're gonna need an expert.

179
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:47,036
- Expert?
- Our expert's dead.

180
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:51,305
All right.

181
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:54,908
Comes off the wall
down here...

182
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:58,978
Well, nice decor.

183
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:00,512
Very early slaughterhouse.

184
00:09:01,747 --> 00:09:03,714
FBI.

185
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:05,216
Guys,
this is Charlene Penn.

186
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:06,684
She's the lead
on the case.

187
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:09,388
More of the same.
Uh, no forced entry.

188
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:11,289
Thrown across the room.

189
00:09:11,357 --> 00:09:12,725
Made to suffer.

190
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:15,061
Both hands and feet
cut off.

191
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:16,897
Same symbol
in the chest.

192
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:20,167
Mm. Whoever the killer is,
the guy's a monster.

193
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:21,468
Excuse me.

194
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,171
This guy's
just like the last one.

195
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:26,905
Early 30s,
decent-looking?

196
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:28,473
Yeah. Just like the first three,
you know?

197
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,141
Fairly successful,
no known enemies.

198
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:31,109
Hmm.

199
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:33,010
Here.

200
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:36,179
Excuse me.

201
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:38,248
I got it.

202
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:40,950
How can I help you?

203
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:42,685
I was just trying
to find out what happened.

204
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:43,753
Jerry was a friend.

205
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,887
I'm very sorry.

206
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:47,322
Jerry was killed
sometime last night.

207
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,025
Do you live nearby?

208
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,026
Yeah.
Two doors down.

209
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:56,430
You, uh, you know anyone
who would want to harm Jerry?

210
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:58,799
No. He was the nicest guy
in the world.

211
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,868
Well, his -- his wife
wasn't real happy with him.

212
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,904
Why's that?

213
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,838
A few nights ago,
he has a little one-night fling.

214
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,274
Ann found out, took off.

215
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,210
But...She would never
do anything like...

216
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,678
Yeah. Of course.

217
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,246
Thanks.

218
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:19,783
Who was that?

219
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:20,951
Neighbor.

220
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,285
Said the vic's wife
caught him cheating.

221
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:24,220
Yeah, but we're not thinking
it's the wife.

222
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:25,488
Not unless she benches 350

223
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:27,189
and did the other guys
as a warm-up.

224
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:29,825
Shoot.

225
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:32,561
I left Bobby's flask
over at Lydia's.

226
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,029
Lydia?

227
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,997
My workout partner
from last night.

228
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:37,498
Now I've got to go get it.

229
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:38,966
So, not only
do you know her name,

230
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:40,234
you're actually gonna
call her?

231
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:41,101
Bite me.

232
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:42,135
Sweet --

233
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:43,503
she gave you her number.

234
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:45,738
They always give you
their number.

235
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,612
Hello?

236
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,880
Lydia.

237
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:57,548
Hey, it's, uh, Dean
from last night.

238
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,250
Uh-huh.

239
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:00,617
Uh, listen, I think I left
something over at your place.

240
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:03,620
It was an old flask.

241
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:06,222
It doesn't look like much,
but it has sentimental value.

242
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,057
So, uh, have you seen it?

243
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,959
No.

244
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:11,293
But if I do,
I'll call.

245
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:13,328
You want my number?

246
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:15,163
My cell grabbed it.

247
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:16,931
Uh...Sorry.

248
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,165
I gotta go.

249
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:19,600
Just real busy
at the moment.

250
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:20,534
Oh.

251
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:27,172
She's <i>real</i> busy.

252
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:49,329
Breathe.

253
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:50,998
Aah!

254
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:52,098
Control, Lydia.

255
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,833
As in all things.

256
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:55,901
One final push.

257
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:58,336
Aah!

258
00:11:58,404 --> 00:11:59,404
The pain is an honor.

259
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,952
What will we call her?

260
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,820
You'll call her Emma.

261
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:23,623
Next.

262
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,460
Fascinating.

263
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:29,228
Truly.

264
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:32,598
And actually, rather
accomplished draftsmanship.

265
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,199
Yeah, if you get past
the fact

266
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:35,967
that it was carved
into a guy's body.

267
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:37,335
Professor Morrison,

268
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:40,404
we're hoping you can tell us
what the symbol means.

269
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:41,772
Yeah, maybe.

270
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:45,408
Maybe?

271
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,577
It's possible I could,
even likely.

272
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:50,812
Is the FBI offering
suitable remuneration?

273
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:56,985
The respect
of a grateful nation.

274
00:12:57,052 --> 00:13:00,387
And a good word
with the I.R.S.

275
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:06,125
Ah.

276
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,495
Well, it appears
quite ancient.

277
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:11,431
Well,
that narrows it down.

278
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:15,067
A corrupted version of symbology
associated with worship.

279
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,636
Definitely an obscure
regional script.

280
00:13:17,704 --> 00:13:19,739
Oh, this will require
some research.

281
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:21,140
All right. Great.

282
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,175
Well, uh, I guess
we'll be seeing you tomorrow.

283
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:25,510
Tomorrow?!

284
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,013
I've spent entire sabbaticals
on a project like this.

285
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:32,048
Professor!

286
00:13:32,116 --> 00:13:33,817
We have a serial killer
on our hands.

287
00:13:33,884 --> 00:13:35,385
Your government
needs you, sir.

288
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:39,655
Gentlemen

289
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:42,090
My housekeeper
needs a green card.

290
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:48,329
Good God,
where'd you find this guy?

291
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:50,331
He's supposed to be a top expert
in his field.

292
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:52,165
Yeah, well, when his field
includes things

293
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,467
that go bump
in the night,

294
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,435
he's gonna be worth
the breath we just wasted.

295
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,336
So, what are we
supposed to do, Dean?

296
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,938
Spin our wheels?

297
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,006
Sam, this <i>is</i> us
spinning our wheels, okay?!

298
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,041
Dean, you know what?
I want to call him, too, okay?

299
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,075
Believe me.

300
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,576
But Bobby's not here.

301
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,911
So we're settling.

302
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,413
Yeah.

303
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,513
We sure are.

304
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:13,849
Damn it,
why hasn't she called?

305
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,517
Who? Lydia?

306
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:19,220
Wait, so some girl's actually
dumping <i>you</i> the morning after?

307
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:22,055
I think you're enjoying this
a little more than you need to.

308
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:24,824
Screw it. I'm going over there
and getting the flask.

309
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,663
Don.

310
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,031
Dean.

311
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,867
I guess you didn't get
my messages.

312
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:41,203
No, I did.
I've been busy.

313
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,039
Oh.

314
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:46,576
Anyway, I, uh, left that flask
over here the other night.

315
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:48,445
Yes. I found it.

316
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,979
It was so beat up and old,
I almost tossed it.

317
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:52,982
Yeah, well, guy it belonged to
was beat up and old, too.

318
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,716
But I was very close
with him,

319
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:56,551
and I'd, uh,
I'd hate to lose it.

320
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:59,353
I'll get it for you.

321
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:02,622
So, how you been?

322
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,591
Other than "busy."

323
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:06,325
Just that.

324
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:08,027
Really busy.
Here you go.

325
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:09,561
Oh, wow.

326
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:12,765
I can see why you're busy.
You've been babysitting, huh?

327
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:14,666
No.

328
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:16,101
Yours?

329
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:18,369
Uh-huh.

330
00:15:18,437 --> 00:15:21,338
You didn't tell me
you had a little girl.

331
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:23,040
There's probably
all kinds of things

332
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:24,307
we didn't tell each other.

333
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,310
What's her name?

334
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:29,845
Emma.

335
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:32,647
Hi, Emma.
Your first?

336
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:33,981
Yes.

337
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:38,016
Well, I hear they grow
like weeds.

338
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:39,785
You have no idea.

339
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:41,586
Oh.

340
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:44,254
Sorry.
I got to take this.

341
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,190
Hello.

342
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:49,191
Mm. Hey.
Where are you?

343
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,927
It's a flask,
not the holy grail.

344
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:53,195
Hey, man, I'm a people person,
all right?

345
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:54,629
I'm engaging
in some social skills.

346
00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:56,598
You get anything out of Morrison?

347
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,800
No. Not yet.
Look, would you get back here?

348
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:00,469
We're due
at the crime lab.

349
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:01,502
Dean?

350
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,803
Hang on.

351
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:04,038
Hey, look,
why don't you just...

352
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:05,172
Who's that guy
in the other room?

353
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,207
Who is that?

354
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:08,942
- You there?
- Shh!

355
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,811
Don't talk.
We'll discuss it later.

356
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,146
Hello!

357
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:15,648
Let me call you back.

358
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:25,556
So, again, we got a guy
weighing about two bills...

359
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:27,191
Thrown into a wall so hard,

360
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:29,826
he's got pieces of plaster
lodged in his skull.

361
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:35,564
What triggered the Feds'
involvement in this case?

362
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:39,468
I always think you boys
have bigger fish to fry.

363
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:41,402
No.

364
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,070
Actually, we...

365
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:44,171
I just figured
it was the similarity

366
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,206
to the other cold cases?

367
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:46,774
If it's the same killer,

368
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,241
then he crossed state lines --
that would bring <i>you</i> guys in.

369
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,245
Well, that's exactly right.

370
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:53,579
Uh, what he said.

371
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:56,081
Yeah. Whatever.

372
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,449
You're gonna have to
wrap this up.

373
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,684
Your case isn't the only one
we're working on.

374
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,825
You get used to her.

375
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:09,426
Uh, so, Eddie, by the way,

376
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:12,028
I didn't bring
the cold-case files with me.

377
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,029
Is there a chance
you have a copy?

378
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:15,064
Yeah.

379
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:16,565
Great.

380
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,470
The Cobalt Room.

381
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:23,571
Mm!

382
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:24,972
Yeah,
it's pretty well known.

383
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,573
Looking to hook up,
it's a pretty good place to go.

384
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:29,642
I've heard.

385
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,177
Vic number two was there.

386
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:32,378
And according to
his security guard,

387
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:33,546
he left with a hot girl.

388
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:34,747
Two days later,
he's an obituary.

389
00:17:34,814 --> 00:17:36,681
Same with Jerry Price.

390
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:38,049
Mm-hmm. And, uh,
as far as we can tell,

391
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:39,283
at least a couple of those
in there.

392
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,185
Same thing in Chicago.

393
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:42,586
Yep. A lot of
busted marriages,

394
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:43,621
flings
with unknown women,

395
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,388
that kind of thing,

396
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:46,289
all just before
they got offed.

397
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,025
Thanks.

398
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,544
Is Emma ready?

399
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:13,245
Yes. Come in.

400
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:15,147
Thank you.

401
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,156
Yeah.

402
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:28,157
Dude.

403
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:29,091
You never showed.

404
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:30,459
I'm outside Lydia's.

405
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,228
Oh, come on, man. What,
are you obsessed or something?

406
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:34,730
No, I'm telling you.

407
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:37,132
I have been eating at the buffet
of strange all afternoon.

408
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,266
Meaning what?

409
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,934
I'll tell you
the second I know.

410
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:41,135
But something
ain't right.

411
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,370
Or you're obsessed.

412
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:43,737
Shut up.
I'm serious.

413
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:46,840
Okay, uh,
you need backup or...

414
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:49,942
No, not yet.
What's up on your end?

415
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,677
Apparently, there was
an identical murder fest

416
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:54,246
two years years ago in Chicago,
and again in Miami

417
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:55,647
two years before that.

418
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,682
All the victims were young,
successful,

419
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,250
a lot of them
went to the same bar.

420
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,152
It lines up. The trails
always went cold fast.

421
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:02,219
Yeah?

422
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:03,587
Yeah.
Oh, and by the way...

423
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:04,855
As a personal kicker,

424
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:06,490
here, at least
some of the vics

425
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,092
hooked up in that bar
you went to,

426
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,660
the, uh,
the Cobalt Room.

427
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:12,930
So, just saying, man, you
you dodged a bullet.

428
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:14,631
Got to go.

429
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:16,333
Nice talk.

430
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:21,704
Emma, hurry up.

431
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:22,939
Come on, Emma.
Time to go.

432
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:32,178
Emma.

433
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:35,415
You be a good girl.

434
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:40,118
Make us proud.

435
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:41,653
I will, mommy.

436
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:52,229
Bye, Emma.

437
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,667
I hate when this happens.

438
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:35,461
So what?

439
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:36,863
I mean, so maybe she has another
kid she didn't tell you about.

440
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,330
Nope, just the one.

441
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:39,632
Emma.

442
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:40,699
But that night,
when I was with her,

443
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,067
she didn't have <i>any.</i>

444
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:43,869
And I was at her place,
man.

445
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:46,237
There was no playpens,
no blankets, no rubber ducks.

446
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,940
Right. Like you would have been
focused on that kind of thing.

447
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:50,808
Hey, dude, that's
the <i>first</i> thing you notice.

448
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,343
Red flags.

449
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,946
Then, all of a sudden,
boom -- baby.

450
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:57,680
Yeah, the one
you thought talked.

451
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:58,915
Oh, it talked.

452
00:20:58,982 --> 00:21:00,950
And not baby talk,
either.

453
00:21:01,017 --> 00:21:03,485
Now you know so much
about child development?

454
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,487
I know enough to know that
they don't say, "Hey, Mom.

455
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,554
Who's <i>that</i> guy?"

456
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:08,756
So, cut to...

457
00:21:08,824 --> 00:21:11,158
Lydia's handing this kid
who's calling her mommy

458
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:12,726
over to these two women,
right?

459
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:14,027
But this is not a baby.

460
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:16,429
No, no, this kid's
got to be 5...

461
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:18,997
And same name -- Emma.

462
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:21,700
You know, George Foreman
named all his sons George.

463
00:21:21,768 --> 00:21:23,702
Are you deliberately
messing with me?

464
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:25,269
Dude, I know weird.

465
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:28,405
Okay? There is no non-weird
explanation for this.

466
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:30,307
This morning,
Emma was a baby.

467
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,742
By sunset,
she's Hannah Montana.

468
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,710
Early years.

469
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,882
It's the Professor.

470
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:42,250
Oh. Good.
The Professor. Yeah.

471
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:44,285
I'm sure he'll crack this wide open.
Shh!

472
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:46,787
On this special night,

473
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:48,989
you join
an exceptional family.

474
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:52,258
You are ready to take
your places alongside us

475
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:55,027
and learn our traditions.

476
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:57,964
This is a tribute to the one
who created and protects us.

477
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:00,566
We hunt for her.

478
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:01,834
We kill for her.

479
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:03,803
And now we consume that kill

480
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,237
as a symbol of unity

481
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:06,671
with those who have completed
their blood missions

482
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:09,172
and furthered the life
of the tribe.

483
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:16,410
Go ahead, Emma.
You need to eat.

484
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:39,279
You know, identifying the scroll
was no day at the beach.

485
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,981
Lesser scholars
would have crumbled.

486
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:43,149
Professor...
The symbol?

487
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:44,483
Yeah. Yeah.

488
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:46,852
It's ancient, regional.

489
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,287
<i>Very</i> difficult to identify.

490
00:22:49,355 --> 00:22:51,255
But I managed
to find a match.

491
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:53,024
It's a variation of a symbol

492
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:55,192
associated with
the Greek Pantheon,

493
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:57,427
the temple of the goddess
Harmonia.

494
00:22:57,494 --> 00:22:58,728
According to myth,

495
00:22:58,796 --> 00:23:00,997
the coupling of Harmonia
and Ares, the God of war,

496
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:02,131
produced the Amazons.

497
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:02,999
The Amazons?

498
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,401
Like Wonder Woman?

499
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:06,169
No, like --
like a tribe of warriors.

500
00:23:06,236 --> 00:23:07,603
They actually existed.

501
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:10,272
The comic books --
they're just silly perversions.

502
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:13,942
The symbol -- I believe it
originated with the Amazons.

503
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:17,344
Pictographs meant to pay homage
to Harmonia --

504
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:19,380
occult talismans,
if you will.

505
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:21,515
They had an exclusively
female culture.

506
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:23,917
No use for men whatsoever,
except procreation.

507
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,552
All the vics <i>were</i> male.

508
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:27,620
So you said --
with this symbol

509
00:23:27,687 --> 00:23:28,854
carved in their chests.

510
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:29,822
And their hands and feet
cut off.

511
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:31,957
Now, <i>that</i> is interesting.

512
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:33,025
Got <i>our</i> attention.

513
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:33,892
After they were
impregnated,

514
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,059
they killed the male --

515
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:36,294
first cutting off
certain body parts.

516
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:40,563
I couldn't check their I.D.s

517
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:42,999
because everything
they have is fake.

518
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:45,034
I've been digging
for hours.

519
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:47,635
And one thing's for sure --
they ain't FBI.

520
00:23:47,703 --> 00:23:49,170
And who are they?

521
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:52,239
They're after us,
is what they are.

522
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,041
Remember that cross-country
murder spree

523
00:23:54,108 --> 00:23:56,042
those crazy brothers
went on a couple months ago?

524
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,310
That's them?

525
00:23:57,378 --> 00:23:58,846
Barely scratches
the surface.

526
00:23:58,914 --> 00:24:01,348
They're thugs.

527
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,083
Vigilantes.

528
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,451
But, look, we've dealt
with hunters like this before.

529
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,852
Well...

530
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,488
The one is already scheduled
to be taken care of.

531
00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:13,057
We'll just simply add
the other one to the agenda.

532
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:17,160
I know Bobby's got a Grecian
encyclopedia of weird in here.

533
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:19,428
I saw it last time I was
looking through this stupid...

534
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,098
Would it kill him
to have a system?

535
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:26,465
He <i>has</i> a system.

536
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,266
His files are set up
like his brain.

537
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:31,401
You got anything?

538
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:33,769
Uh, yeah.

539
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:35,736
There's this whole crazy side
to Amazon lore

540
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:37,740
that Professor Morrison
didn't even mention.

541
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:39,608
That's 'cause
he doesn't believe in it,

542
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:42,143
which is a real handicap when
you're trying to deal with it.

543
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,111
Right.

544
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:47,014
Um, apparently,
there was this long, bloody war.

545
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:48,949
The Amazon population
was decimated,

546
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:50,518
so they made a bargain
with Harmonia

547
00:24:50,586 --> 00:24:52,487
to replenish their ranks
and make them stronger.

548
00:24:52,554 --> 00:24:55,823
Well, I'd say throwing grown men
through walls was stronger.

549
00:24:55,891 --> 00:24:58,625
Yeah. Well, basically,
they became more than human.

550
00:24:58,693 --> 00:25:00,661
Harmonia turned them
into monsters.

551
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:01,964
Can you kill them
like humans?

552
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:03,132
Or is there
some kind of trick?

553
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,434
Uh  doesn't say.

554
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:07,102
No idea. I guess
it could go either way.

555
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,570
Well, that's helpful.
What else?

556
00:25:11,507 --> 00:25:15,342
The lore says
they reproduced quickly --

557
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,646
as in, after mating,
they gave birth within 36 hours.

558
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:22,248
The babies grew
incredibly fast,

559
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:25,550
then the aging process
became normal.

560
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:29,220
Which is one way
to make an army, I guess.

561
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:31,956
The mating cycle
is every two years.

562
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:33,623
They send out all the women who
have reached child-bearing age.

563
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:34,857
Which lines up,

564
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:36,291
'cause this happens
every couple of years

565
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,258
in different towns, right?

566
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:38,559
Yeah.

567
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:41,464
And we know for sure
that at least some of the vics

568
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:43,199
hooked up with strange women

569
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:45,401
days before being killed
Amazon style.

570
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:50,071
Hooked up in the same bar
I met Lydia, right?

571
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:52,073
Yeah.

572
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:53,474
And then suddenly,

573
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:56,543
she's got a little baby
in like fruit-fly time.

574
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:59,579
That baby turns
into a little girl just as fast.

575
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:02,181
Wow.

576
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:04,550
- So maybe you're --
- Don't say it.

577
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:06,952
Look,
if that kid's yours --

578
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:08,253
I said don't say it!

579
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:09,787
Fine. I won't.
But, Dean...

580
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:13,790
Dude, seriously, a one-night
stand, you're just gonna...

581
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,425
- Roll the dice? You don't even --
- Of course not...

582
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:17,593
Sam. What, do you think
I'm brain-dead?

583
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:20,764
Accidents happen.

584
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:22,699
If one even did,

585
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,634
which I-I-I don't think...

586
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,206
No. You know what?
Stop.

587
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:32,041
We're not gonna talk
about this anymore

588
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:33,642
because my skin's
starting to crawl!

589
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,843
All right, fine.

590
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,078
But if it's true,
if it happened...

591
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:39,280
I know. I got to hang on
to my hands and feet.

592
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:50,022
We are so pleased
with your progress.

593
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,991
You are absorbing the traditions
of our mothers,

594
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:55,994
and you are close to fulfilling
your tribal destiny,

595
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:58,328
and taking your place
alongside your sisters.

596
00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:00,230
Today, you are a warrior.

597
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:03,632
Though you may walk
among others,

598
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,603
your heart is only
with the tribe.

599
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,339
Soon, you will take the final,
glorious step

600
00:27:09,406 --> 00:27:11,507
into adulthood.

601
00:27:11,574 --> 00:27:13,842
Today, you will learn
how to endure pain

602
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,744
and how to inflict it.

603
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:18,347
Fight it, Emma.

604
00:27:18,414 --> 00:27:20,849
As with all you do,

605
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:22,650
courage is everything.

606
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:31,558
Looking through Bobby's files
is like dumpster diving.

607
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:32,826
Yeah, tell me about it.

608
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:37,063
So, it makes sense
why the Amazons

609
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:40,934
all want to hook up with
decent-looking, successful guys.

610
00:27:41,002 --> 00:27:42,583
Oh, they're picky
about the gene pool?

611
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:43,403
Right.

612
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:46,638
So

613
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,740
What was Lydia doing
with you?

614
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:51,308
Well, she may
or may not have thought

615
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,542
I was a rich
investment banker.

616
00:28:01,883 --> 00:28:03,183
Sam.

617
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,217
Yeah.

618
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:05,785
These papers just moved.

619
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,588
- What?
- I didn't touch them.

620
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,335
It's all over the place.

621
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:29,906
Redline.

622
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,145
Redline.

623
00:28:36,212 --> 00:28:38,914
Oh, and...

624
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:41,849
Power lines
by the <i>open window,</i>

625
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:43,516
where there's a <i>breeze...</i>

626
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,584
- That could have moved the papers.
- Did you feel a breeze?

627
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:47,584
It doesn't matter, Dean.
The readings are useless.

628
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:51,854
Hey.

629
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:54,090
Maybe, uh...

630
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,893
We burned him, Dean.

631
00:28:58,961 --> 00:29:00,595
- So what?
- So, what are you suggesting?

632
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:01,896
I don't know.
What are you?

633
00:29:01,964 --> 00:29:03,998
Concentrate
on something else.

634
00:29:04,065 --> 00:29:06,600
- Why?
- Because it's not Bobby!

635
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:08,034
- Could be.
- No, it <i>couldn't</i> be.

636
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:09,803
- Why not?
- Because we <i>want</i> it to be.

637
00:29:14,908 --> 00:29:16,074
Maybe it's useful.

638
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:18,510
It's in a pile of
"maybe it's useful."

639
00:29:18,611 --> 00:29:21,079
Besides, it's in Greek.
Nobody reads Greek.

640
00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:23,514
Yeah, except Greeks.

641
00:29:23,582 --> 00:29:25,349
Oh, and Bobby.

642
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:28,285
And Professor Morrison.

643
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:30,954
Really?

644
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,522
I'm going, Dean.

645
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,424
You stay here,
keep the door locked.

646
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:35,458
Don't go anywhere.

647
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,760
I mean it.

648
00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:38,995
Fine.

649
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,106
Oh, you have <i>got</i>
<i>to be kidding.</i>

650
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:54,408
I have office hours
tomorrow --

651
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:56,309
I'm sorry, Professor.
I need your help.

652
00:29:57,744 --> 00:29:59,544
The FBI isn't paying me enough
for this.

653
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:02,613
All right.
I'll sweeten the deal.

654
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,715
We'll remove your wiretap.

655
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:49,318
Hi.

656
00:30:49,386 --> 00:30:51,820
You don't know me,
but my name is Emma.

657
00:30:51,888 --> 00:30:53,988
I need your help.

658
00:30:54,056 --> 00:30:55,723
I think I'm in trouble,

659
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:58,625
and you're the only person
I can trust.

660
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:01,294
Why?

661
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:03,629
Because you're my father.

662
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:16,946
How'd you find me?

663
00:31:16,947 --> 00:31:18,681
They've been watching you,

664
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:20,650
ever since mom
got pregnant.

665
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:23,585
Well, if you're
such a prisoner,

666
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:26,255
you mind telling me
how you escaped?

667
00:31:26,323 --> 00:31:28,090
I waited
until lights out.

668
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:29,959
The women who watch over us

669
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:32,428
change shifts
a little after 10:00.

670
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:34,363
Uh-huh.

671
00:31:34,431 --> 00:31:35,431
And you left because...?

672
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:40,236
They stick you in there,

673
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:42,471
and you trust them.

674
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:46,175
It's all you know.

675
00:31:46,243 --> 00:31:49,612
And you don't question
what they want you to do --

676
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,514
terrible things.

677
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:54,817
That's why I had to leave.

678
00:31:54,884 --> 00:31:57,519
They tortured me.

679
00:31:57,586 --> 00:31:59,819
They told me
I had to endure pain

680
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:01,954
so I could be strong
like them.

681
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:04,123
But I don't want to be
like them.

682
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:06,792
Okay.

683
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:08,526
Come on in.

684
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:18,768
Have a seat.

685
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,206
Okay.

686
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:26,442
Let's assume that you're not...
Like them.

687
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,078
Yet.

688
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:31,213
What do you
want me to do?

689
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,181
Get me away from here.

690
00:32:36,082 --> 00:32:37,782
You're a good man.

691
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,016
My mother told me that.

692
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:43,520
I seriously doubt
she said that.

693
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,887
And if you knew me, you would
seriously doubt it's true.

694
00:32:46,954 --> 00:32:49,088
They told me
you're a hunter.

695
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:52,393
So maybe you'll understand
about me.

696
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,694
Maybe you can
protect me.

697
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:58,630
Just long enough
so I can get away.

698
00:32:58,697 --> 00:33:00,197
Then I'll leave you alone.

699
00:33:02,132 --> 00:33:04,999
I know you don't want me.

700
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,367
All right,
let's not...Go there, okay?

701
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:07,267
This isn't a matter of...

702
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:12,303
You get this isn't
a normal situation, right?

703
00:33:12,371 --> 00:33:13,704
How would I know?

704
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:16,406
Three days ago,
I wasn't even alive.

705
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:18,808
Now here I am.

706
00:33:18,876 --> 00:33:20,443
My mother threw me
into that place.

707
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,877
And my father...

708
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,213
...well...

709
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:30,151
You get this is
my last chance

710
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:32,757
to have anything normal
ever, right?

711
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:35,592
It's fascinating.

712
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,159
What's it say?

713
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:39,261
Oh, I haven't
gotten there yet.

714
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,795
The paper is handmade.

715
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:43,031
A cellulose,
rather like papyrus,

716
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,298
which would explain
its durability.

717
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:45,699
- Professor --
- Wherever did you get it?

718
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,034
Uh...

719
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:50,770
A crazy, drunk, old genius.

720
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:52,805
- Yeah.
- They always have the good stuff.

721
00:33:52,873 --> 00:33:54,039
Well, it's in Greek.

722
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:56,174
Yeah, yeah.
I-I know that.

723
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,942
Not a common dialect.

724
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,444
My God,
what is it with you and Amazons?

725
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:02,379
Professor, it's important.

726
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:04,714
At 11:30 at night,
it better be.

727
00:34:04,782 --> 00:34:06,382
Oh, here's a new twist.

728
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,817
It repeats
the conventional lore.

729
00:34:08,885 --> 00:34:10,619
Amazon warriors mate with males.
The males are murdered.

730
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:12,422
Yada, yada.
But according to this...

731
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,056
It's not the women
who do the killing.

732
00:34:14,124 --> 00:34:16,859
Instead,
a ritual of initiation

733
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:19,761
requires that the child
born of the mating process

734
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:21,296
must kill her own father.

735
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:23,565
What?

736
00:34:27,868 --> 00:34:30,103
You look exhausted.

737
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:31,605
And starving?

738
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,475
It's been a tough
sweet 16.

739
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:38,311
So you believe me?

740
00:34:40,814 --> 00:34:42,414
You'll help me?

741
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:45,283
If you really want help.

742
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:52,188
Detective.

743
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,923
Agent.
You're here late.

744
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,425
Yeah. Listen, could we talk
in the morning?

745
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:58,635
What's your hurry...

746
00:35:00,003 --> 00:35:01,137
...Sam?

747
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:04,540
Sam Winchester.
Let's see.

748
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:07,110
I could run you in for
impersonating a federal agent.

749
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:19,983
Ohh.

750
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:37,857
Well, now, what happens when
they find out you're missing?

751
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:40,926
They may have
already found out.

752
00:35:40,994 --> 00:35:43,160
And they'll hunt me down.

753
00:35:49,265 --> 00:35:51,233
Look, I know this is
gonna be hard,

754
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:55,237
but if I'm gonna get out,
I have to do it now.

755
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:57,339
We got cheese
and a leftover burrito.

756
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:00,008
Doesn't make a difference.

757
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:08,750
You were asking
if I believed you.

758
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,326
I was told
you'd be a challenge.

759
00:36:20,394 --> 00:36:22,661
I figured
you'd chat me up...

760
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:24,862
Try and catch me
off guard.

761
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,997
Almost worked.

762
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:28,599
I was expecting
your mother.

763
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:35,907
It's not her place.

764
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:38,077
<i>I</i> have to kill you.

765
00:36:38,145 --> 00:36:40,079
- Is that what they told you?
- It's what I am.

766
00:36:40,146 --> 00:36:41,313
Well, then, I should just
kill you right now.

767
00:36:41,381 --> 00:36:42,614
Sure.

768
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:44,350
But you could have done that
30 seconds ago.

769
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,396
It's weirdly hard,
isn't it?

770
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,766
- It is for me.
- Knock it off.

771
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:01,567
How could it not be?
You're my father.

772
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:03,703
- Hey! We're not gonna do that.
- But it's true.

773
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:06,040
You're the reason
that we're standing here.

774
00:37:06,108 --> 00:37:07,909
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you.

775
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:11,978
So now someone
has to kill someone.

776
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:16,916
You know what?

777
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,184
So far, my childhood's been
kind of disappointing.

778
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:23,120
You haven't killed
anybody yet, Emma.

779
00:37:23,188 --> 00:37:25,421
Walk away.

780
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:27,490
Right now --
I won't go after you.

781
00:37:27,557 --> 00:37:30,292
I can't.

782
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,461
I don't have a choice.

783
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,837
Please don't let him hurt me.

784
00:38:22,306 --> 00:38:25,041
Here's the mother ship.

785
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:26,343
Let's get this done.

786
00:38:35,252 --> 00:38:37,120
They're gone.

787
00:38:57,827 --> 00:39:00,261
Hey, you know what?
I don't like it, either.

788
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:02,797
I wanted to torture them
just as much as you.

789
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:04,531
Yeah, but, hey...

790
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,102
Next time they surface,
we'll be ready...

791
00:39:08,169 --> 00:39:10,536
If we live that long.

792
00:39:13,506 --> 00:39:15,607
All right, fine.
Just sit there and be pissed.

793
00:39:18,476 --> 00:39:20,777
What did you say to me...

794
00:39:20,845 --> 00:39:22,279
When <i>I</i> was the one
who choked?

795
00:39:22,346 --> 00:39:23,613
What did you say
about Amy?

796
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:24,981
"You kill the monster!"

797
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:26,348
I was <i>going</i> to!

798
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:28,050
Oh, the hell you were!
You think I'm an idiot?

799
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:29,218
What, you think <i>i</i> am?

800
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,752
Dean, you were gonna
let her walk!

801
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,287
No, I wasn't.
That's ridiculous!

802
00:39:32,354 --> 00:39:35,389
Look, man,
she was <i>not</i> yours.

803
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,458
Not really.

804
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:42,829
Actually, she, uh,
she <i>was,</i> really.

805
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:47,299
She just also happened to be
a crazy man-killing monster.

806
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:48,667
But, uh, hey.

807
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:49,768
You know what?
Bobby was right.

808
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:51,636
Your head's
not in it, man.

809
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:54,205
When Cass died,
you were wobbly, but now...

810
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:55,539
Now <i>what?</i>

811
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:57,541
Oh, what, you're dealing with it
so perfect?

812
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:58,775
Yeah, news flash, pal --

813
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:01,044
you're just as screwed up
as I am!

814
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:03,746
You're just...Bigger.

815
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,450
What?!

816
00:40:07,551 --> 00:40:08,484
I don't know.

817
00:40:11,554 --> 00:40:13,922
Look...

818
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,692
Dean, the thing is,
tonight...

819
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,461
It almost got you killed.

820
00:40:19,528 --> 00:40:21,263
Now, I don't care
how you deal.

821
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,031
I really, really don't.

822
00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:25,099
But just don't --

823
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,467
don't get killed.

824
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:31,904
I'll do what I can.

825
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:35,940
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

826
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:37,675
It means I'll do what I can.
All right?

827
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:40,576
You can shut up about it.

828
