1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,874
I'm having a difficult time
figuring out what's real.

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,004
Hallucinations?

3
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:06,112
Sometimes I see Lucifer.

4
00:00:06,137 --> 00:00:07,499
Wait, are you seeing him
right now?

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,990
Let me see your hand.

6
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:11,125
I was with you
when you cut it.

7
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:12,343
I sewed it up.

8
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:16,246
This is real.

9
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:18,849
There are things much older
than souls in Purgatory,

10
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,302
and you gulped
those in, too.

11
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:22,603
- I can't hold them back!
- Hold who back?

12
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:23,520
Leviathan!

13
00:00:26,758 --> 00:00:28,592
Those...
Whatever-you-call-'ems...

14
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:29,443
Leviathan.

15
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:30,965
If they're in the pipes,

16
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,583
they got themselves
a highway to anywhere.

17
00:00:33,418 --> 00:00:34,585
Something's eating folks

18
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,504
down at Sioux Falls
General Hospital.

19
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:38,172
A few of us
in the right positions,

20
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:39,873
and we could feast
every single day.

21
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:41,809
I'll meet you at the house.
We can regroup.

22
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:42,893
That place was torched.

23
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:44,145
Somebody knew
what they were doing.

24
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,146
Bobby!

25
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:45,813
Oh, no.

26
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,105
I got two males --
one with a head trauma,

27
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:54,757
one with an open
compound tibia fracture.

28
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:56,470
- On route to Sioux Falls.
- Sioux Falls General?

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,609
You got to take us
somewhere else. Anywhere!

30
00:00:58,694 --> 00:01:00,077
Please!

31
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:02,697
Hey,
so maybe I'm not real.

32
00:01:02,748 --> 00:01:04,582
But I'm not
going anywhere, Sam.

33
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,535
Sammy? You stay with me,
you hear?

34
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:09,003
- He's seizing.
- Sammy!

35
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:16,927
No response.

36
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:19,246
B.P.'S 60 over 30.

37
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:22,350
Pupils fixed and dilated.

38
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:27,104
Hold him down.

39
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,557
Three, two, one, set!

40
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:30,891
Nurse!

41
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:33,778
Just relax.

42
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:34,945
Where am I?

43
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,364
You're at the hospital.

44
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,015
- Which one?
- Sioux Falls General.

45
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:42,870
Where's my brother?
We got to go.

46
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,572
He bashed his head
quite seriously.

47
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:45,656
He's gone up for an MRI.

48
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:47,074
Okay. I got to go.

49
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,793
You're not going anywhere
on this leg, buddy.

50
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:50,127
No.

51
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,141
Oh, no, no, no.

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,008
What?

53
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:44,432
You okay?

54
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:46,767
Bobby, you're alive.

55
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:49,002
'Course I am.
Why are you on the floor?

56
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:53,140
They gave me morphine.
A lot.

57
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,693
Hey, look, a monster
broke my leg.

58
00:02:57,813 --> 00:02:58,813
Oh.

59
00:02:58,864 --> 00:03:00,281
Wait...the house.

60
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,349
We thought you were dead.

61
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:05,236
Well, I ain't.
Not yet.

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,620
But we got to run.

63
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:08,789
This place ain't safe.

64
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:10,241
Where's Sam?

65
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:12,960
Uh...
Head scan, I think.

66
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,962
Meet me at the ambulance dock,
stat.

67
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,248
- I'll find Sam.
- Wait, where?

68
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,083
Bobby, I'm a gimp.

69
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,003
Hey.

70
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:32,263
You've scheduled dessert,
I presume?

71
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,986
Yes?

72
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,654
The Winchesters?

73
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:58,572
Hold the phone there, son.
Who's this?

74
00:03:58,623 --> 00:04:01,709
Yeah, this is the guy.
Coverage lapsed.

75
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,094
We're shipping him
to county.

76
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:05,463
Come on, sicko.

77
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:07,214
Let's get you healed up
someplace a little safer.

78
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:48,923
Come on, Dean.

79
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,726
Balls.

80
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,397
Come on, Dean.

81
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,799
Come on, Dean!

82
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,987
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

Dude...Ricardo.

86
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,916
What happened?

87
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,217
<i>Suicidio.</i>

88
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:53,670
<i>Adi?s, ese.</i>

89
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,004
Well, this ought to
cheer you up.

90
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,736
My baby!

91
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,039
Now I just got to get this stupid
thing off and I can drive again.

92
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,758
So how is it out there?

93
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:08,727
Weird with a side order
of bloody.

94
00:06:08,794 --> 00:06:10,228
Talked to a few hunters.

95
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:12,714
They're running into
the same kind of thing

96
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:14,683
that set up shop
at that hospital.

97
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,551
Yeah, and don't forget
tried to kill us at your place.

98
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:19,437
Well, consensus is
they're, um,

99
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:20,972
they're like shapeshifters

100
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:22,857
only a lot more
into eating folk.

101
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:26,478
And nothing can kill 'em.

102
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:28,647
Good times.
Anything else?

103
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:30,281
Yep.
They bleed black goo.

104
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:32,517
Like that stuff
that came out of Cass --

105
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:34,119
those things from Purgatory.

106
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:37,622
- Uh...Leviathan.
- Yep.

107
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:39,524
What about those chompers that you
and the sheriff saw at the hospital?

108
00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:40,542
They still
making spleenburgers?

109
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,910
Yeah, made some calls.

110
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:44,245
That doctor never
showed back up to work.

111
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:45,997
Ditto a nurse
and some administrator.

112
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:48,633
<i>You never left, Sam.</i>
<i>They took off.</i>

113
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:49,788
So they could be
at any hospital in America.

114
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:51,013
<i>You're still in the cage...</i>
<i>with me.</i>

115
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:53,054
<i>What do you think,</i>
<i>Sammy?</i>

116
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,973
Sammy?

117
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:57,308
Sam.

118
00:06:57,393 --> 00:06:59,978
<i>Sam...</i>
<i>Hey, ground control!</i>

119
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:01,479
Sam!

120
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:07,652
Yeah. What?
I'm -- I'm right here.

121
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:08,820
You okay?

122
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:10,155
Yeah. I'm fine.

123
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:17,028
Good.

124
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:20,148
Every last bit of info
I ever had burned down,

125
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,033
so...
- What about this place?

126
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:24,085
Rufus leave anything?
Did you check the basement?

127
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,820
C-rations and dust.

128
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:28,857
I don't think
he'd been here in years.

129
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:31,710
So, I got to go round up
my old library.

130
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:33,828
I thought you said most of those
books were one-of-a-kind.

131
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,297
Yeah. That's why I stashed
copies all over the place.

132
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,219
Okay, good. Um...

133
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:43,838
Hey, uh, two-legs.
We're fresh out of grub.

134
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,106
Want to make a run?

135
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,025
Sure. Yeah.

136
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:50,395
Be careful with her,
would you?

137
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,846
And, uh, Sam?

138
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:53,314
Yeah?

139
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,400
Pie.

140
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:58,036
Obviously.

141
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:04,192
- So?
- "So" what?

142
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:06,861
Before you bail again,
"Girl, Interrupted" over there.

143
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:07,979
Any thoughts?

144
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,416
Looks to me
like he's doing better.

145
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,418
Better? What do you mean,
better? You just saw him!

146
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:15,053
Saw him check out <i>once.</i>

147
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:16,704
- That's progress.
- You're kidding!

148
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:18,840
Look, seems to me
that Sam's head

149
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:20,892
ain't no different
than your leg.

150
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:22,811
People heal on a curve.

151
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,480
Not diff-- Bobby, I get
this thing off in five days,

152
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,731
I'm golden.

153
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:28,650
Sam's not a curve.
He's a frickin' time bomb.

154
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,051
It ain't like
he's keeping secrets.

155
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:31,936
What you see
is what you get.

156
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:34,072
What's so nuts
about calling an upswing?

157
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:37,158
Because that's not how it works,
Bobby, <i>ever!</i>

158
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:40,028
All right?
Especially not with Sam.

159
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:41,629
The other shoe
is gonna drop.

160
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,414
- It's just a matter of when.
- Okay.

161
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:45,166
How 'bout we worry
about <i>today's</i> problems?

162
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,568
And today, we need intel.

163
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,789
I'm going.
You sit there and stew.

164
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:52,257
I'll check in.

165
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:57,462
Look...you sitting here
wringing your hands

166
00:08:57,546 --> 00:09:00,215
ain't gonna do nothing.

167
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:03,501
Maybe he'll surprise you.

168
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,534
? Well, I've walked through
those swinging doors ?

169
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,203
? a least a hundred times ?

170
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,272
Hey.

171
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:27,559
? She looked into my eyes ?

172
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:29,544
? I know just what she said ?

173
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,714
? and she said,
"give me a twirl" ?

174
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,134
? and I really couldn't tell you
what happened to that girl ?

175
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:37,886
Paper, too?

176
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,889
Uh, yeah. Yeah, please.

177
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,423
? ...At that hardwood floor ?

178
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:44,058
Here.

179
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,812
? Wishing she was here
so I could beg her for more ?

180
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:52,466
? and she was... ?

181
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:53,968
Yes, sir.

182
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,154
Do you see any other strange
charges on your statement?

183
00:09:56,188 --> 00:10:00,408
The May 27th charge
to "Mistress Magda," perhaps?

184
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,161
Oh. Sorry for asking.

185
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,416
We're gonna have to call
you back.

186
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,508
Yes?

187
00:10:17,593 --> 00:10:19,260
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,346
The Winchesters have triggered
one of my search programs.

189
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,380
Great.

190
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:24,665
A shop in Montana,

191
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:26,233
about a day and a half,
maybe two days from here.

192
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:28,290
- So?
- So?

193
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:31,890
So, why are you
still talking to <i>me?</i>

194
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:37,812
Ah, thank you.

195
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:41,115
Yep.

196
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,867
Where's Bobby?

197
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:45,153
- He take off?
- Yeah.

198
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:48,489
Hey, Sam, how you doing?

199
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,574
Fine.

200
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:55,546
I mean, you still,
you know...

201
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:59,467
Yeah, no,
I-I know what you mean.

202
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,037
Yeah, I'm -- I'm still seeing
crap that's not real.

203
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:05,206
But, yeah, I'm fine.

204
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:07,725
I mean,
I can tell the difference.

205
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:11,095
Think it's getting better?

206
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,065
Honestly? Uh...

207
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,901
I don't know.

208
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:19,237
I just know
I'm managing it, so...

209
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:21,489
So don't worry.

210
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:30,081
Where's the pie?

211
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:32,600
I got cake.

212
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,419
It's close enough, right?

213
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:04,983
Yeah, so, from what I can tell,

214
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:08,102
it's something called a Kitsune.

215
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:09,237
Not much.

216
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:11,105
They...look human...

217
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:12,606
till they sprout out claws

218
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:14,742
and stab you behind your ear
to get to your brain.

219
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:19,947
I don't --
I don't know yet.

220
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:23,167
Yes, Dean, I realize
killing 'em's important.

221
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:26,054
Maybe if Uncle Bobby
sent a book in <i>English.</i>

222
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,305
I am!

223
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:30,591
No, no, don't --
don't put him on the phone.

224
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:32,010
Hi, Dad.

225
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:36,014
Yes, sir.

226
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:39,434
I realize people are dying.

227
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:42,320
Yeah, I'm on my way
to the library right now.

228
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:22,343
Sorry, honey.
Price went up.

229
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:24,812
$55.

230
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:36,157
Oh, I don't --
I don't have it.

231
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,126
That's too bad.

232
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,361
Maybe we can make
a little trade.

233
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:42,630
Hmm?

234
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:14,479
Aah!

235
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:47,403
Other shoe!

236
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:48,738
Other who?

237
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,707
Sam. He took off.

238
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:51,758
Where?

239
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,376
I don't know.
Nowhere good.

240
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,161
Well, maybe he needed
a little "me-time."

241
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:57,063
Yeah, but his me-time
ain't just him.

242
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:58,364
I mean, for all we know

243
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:00,500
he's road trippin'
with Lucifer somewhere.

244
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:03,202
Left me here like
Jimmy friggin' Stewart.

245
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,254
- I assume you called.
- Straight to voicemail.

246
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,689
He turned his GPS off,
too.

247
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:08,474
<i>And</i> he took my car!

248
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,510
- Don't panic.
- Too late!

249
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,878
Look, he says he's okay,

250
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,597
so give it
a couple of days.

251
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,649
Just till
you get the cast off --

252
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,217
then hunt him down.

253
00:15:18,268 --> 00:15:20,853
Till then,
we'll both just keep calling.

254
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:21,938
All right.

255
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:30,696
You're goin' down.

256
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:39,005
You guys thinking
this is another one --

257
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,040
so-called ice pick killer?
- Same M.O.

258
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:42,675
Can't say I'm too broken up
about this one.

259
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:43,909
Oh, you knew him?

260
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:45,595
Busted him
half a dozen times.

261
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,547
- Real mensch.
- So, what's the deal?

262
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:50,249
Um, killer comes to town,
ganks a lowlife, moves along?

263
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,601
Looks like.

264
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,586
Stabs 'em all exactly the same,
right? Behind the ear?

265
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:55,555
Yeah.
No explaining a psycho.

266
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:58,357
We left that detail
out of the paper, though.

267
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,892
How'd you know?

268
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:01,594
I worked a case like this
a few years back.

269
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:02,829
Think it's related?

270
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,315
You find anything weird
about the brains?

271
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,766
Like what?

272
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:10,036
Like...missing.

273
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,770
Huh. Good question
for the coroner.

274
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:13,823
Right. Thanks.

275
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,397
How you doing?

276
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:42,602
Uh, was there a, uh,
big guy in here yesterday?

277
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,970
That's specific.

278
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:46,405
Uh, I mean big.

279
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,274
Like about yea high?

280
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:49,442
Maybe.

281
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,661
- Uh, brown hair?
- Yes, yes. That's him.

282
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,529
Do you, uh -- you remember
what he bought?

283
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:56,249
Snacks, maybe?

284
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,451
How about a paper?
Do you have yesterday's paper?

285
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:00,419
Yeah, right there.

286
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:12,215
Do you mind?

287
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,668
We don't get too many murders
out this way...

288
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,354
...much less a serial.

289
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,972
- So what'd you find?
- It's what we <i>didn't</i> find.

290
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:22,942
Let me show you.

291
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:26,028
Big chunk of mid-brain
went missing.

292
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:29,482
Mid-brain,
like pituitary gland?

293
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:32,118
Actually, their pituitaries
were clear gone.

294
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,020
How'd you know that?

295
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:36,739
Yeah, so, they need

296
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,358
a steady diet of human
pituitary glands to survive.

297
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:41,510
Educated guess.

298
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,470
Hang on. Slow down.

299
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,841
Right.

300
00:17:55,893 --> 00:18:00,763
So, the victims are located
in parks just off the highway.

301
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,481
Just one per town.

302
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,183
That's something.

303
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:07,153
What?

304
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,521
I-I'm just tired.

305
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:10,389
I've been looking at this
for like eight years.

306
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:13,793
Wait. Hang on.

307
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,829
I'll call you right back.

308
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,694
Triple red eye, please.

309
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:51,030
Okay.

310
00:18:58,322 --> 00:19:01,457
Triple red eye.

311
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,159
Thanks.

312
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,887
You stab it in the heart.

313
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:09,675
Stab it in the heart.

314
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,811
I said,
you stab it in the heart!

315
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:12,812
Shh!

316
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,182
Okay. Are you guys cool?

317
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:19,652
Can I have a normal life
for five minutes now?

318
00:20:19,703 --> 00:20:21,570
Oh, Dean.

319
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,657
Quick question --

320
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,692
how do you talk to girls?

321
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:40,506
Um...

322
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:44,376
I just wanted to, you know,

323
00:20:44,428 --> 00:20:45,945
say hi and --
no.

324
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,597
Go away.

325
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:55,554
It's just, I'm not supposed to
talk to boys.

326
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:26,524
Leave me alone.

327
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:27,548
Come on.
We just want to talk.

328
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:29,572
-  I have to go.
- Why so rude?

329
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:31,472
Don't touch me!

330
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:33,671
- Hey. I said be nice.
- Why don't <i>you?</i>

331
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,561
Butt out.

332
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:52,828
Hi. I'm Sam.

333
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:55,498
I'm Amy.

334
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,274
Oh, damn it.

335
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:32,701
Hi, Amy.

336
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,640
Sam.

337
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:42,526
- Wow.
- Yeah.

338
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,998
I just...never thought
I'd see you again.

339
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:48,649
- What are you doing here?
- I think you know.

340
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:51,419
You got tall, huh?

341
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:54,789
Small talk? Really?

342
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,156
Let's take a walk.

343
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,875
Sam --
walk.

344
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,061
So, same pattern,
same victim pool --

345
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,796
just like
when we were kids.

346
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,048
No, I-it's not what --
look, I'm not --

347
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,500
I've had the same job
for the last six years.

348
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,552
I-I have a house,
two cats, a mortgage.

349
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,720
I have a normal life.

350
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,856
You call this normal?

351
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,441
[ The Goo Goo Dolls'
"Two Days in February" plays ]

352
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:15,676
Ready to play doctor?

353
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,029
? I hung your picture
on the wall ?

354
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,180
? and that's all it is ?

355
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,449
So, you gonna tell me?

356
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:22,767
What?

357
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,152
How you kicked the crap
out of those guys.

358
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,537
I mean...

359
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,372
No offense,
but you're kind of...

360
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:29,523
Wiry?

361
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,525
Exactly.

362
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,693
So...?

363
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:35,429
Just watch
a lot of Bruce Lee movies.

364
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,166
? You say you got no faith
in things you can't see ?

365
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:40,968
You thirsty?

366
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:42,219
Sure.

367
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:44,505
? I'm sorry
I ain't there with you ?

368
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:48,309
? but you ain't here with me ?

369
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:52,146
So, you live around here?

370
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:53,564
It's a cool song.

371
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:56,150
My dad doesn't listen
to anything

372
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,218
recorded after 1979, so...

373
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,721
Does that mean
you can't?

374
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,406
I'm kind of
stuck in the car a lot.

375
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:05,109
My dad has to travel.
For work.

376
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,028
Yeah, me and my mom
bounce around a lot, too.

377
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,229
She's all about, like,
"Letting the wind be our guide."

378
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,331
Like a hippie?

379
00:24:10,398 --> 00:24:12,366
Minus the peace and love.

380
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,374
? You said that this is crazy,
you're a half a world away ?

381
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:21,926
We're always on the road.

382
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,428
I mean, I've seen the world's
biggest ball of twine twice.

383
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:26,764
Three times.
Not that big.

384
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:28,182
Right?

385
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:29,416
Okay, but be honest --

386
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,152
I mean,
moving all the time sucks.

387
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,937
You're always the new kid,

388
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:36,223
and everyone always thinks
you're a freak.

389
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,642
Sam, you <i>are</i> a freak.

390
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:44,398
But so was, I don't know,
Jimi Hendrix and...Picasso.

391
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,833
So am I.

392
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,121
All the coolest people
are freaks.

393
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:53,407
? ...Wrong, oh, ho, ho ?

394
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,743
? it's all right ?

395
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:57,244
Sam.

396
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:00,214
What I am, I'm managing it.

397
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:03,084
You spiked three guys
this <i>week.</i>

398
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,419
No, you don't understand.
It's not like that.

399
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,722
I'm -- I'm not
just some murderer.

400
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:09,724
- I <i>had</i> to.
- Why?

401
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,061
I can't.

402
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:16,814
I just had to.

403
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:19,299
Please believe me, Sam.

404
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,355
I can't. I'm sorry.

405
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,573
So am I.

406
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,177
This is the one
he asked to see.

407
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:48,179
Great, great.

408
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:49,930
Uh, let me ask you,
did he do anything to it?

409
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,400
No. He just asked
a few questions

410
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,852
about the other vics --

411
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:58,973
missing pituitary glands
and so forth.

412
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,641
Son of a bitch.

413
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,812
Sam's chasin' a <i>what?</i>

414
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,147
A Kitsune.

415
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,732
It's pretty rare. Dad and I
hunted one back in '98.

416
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,068
Vaguely rings a bell.

417
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,953
Yeah, didn't make
our highlight reel.

418
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:15,206
Well, least now we know
he's working a job.

419
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,541
- Yeah, but why pull the Houdini act?
- Not a clue.

420
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:18,859
What are you gonna do
when you catch up?

421
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,612
I got a few ideas.

422
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:36,310
How did you find me?

423
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:39,647
You dropped this.

424
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:42,049
"Amy Pond," huh?

425
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,684
Cute name.

426
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,706
You weren't kidding
about the mortgage.

427
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,773
Sam...

428
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:53,110
Wait, that's fresh.

429
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:56,563
That's not mine.

430
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,333
So, you killed <i>again!</i>
<i>You think I wanted to?</i>

431
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,452
I think you better tell me
<i>exactly</i> what you're doing,

432
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,003
or I have to kill you
whether I want to or not!

433
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:03,787
I can't.

434
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,574
- Sam, you know me.
- No, I <i>knew</i> you.

435
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,576
That was a long time ago.
No, you know me.

436
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,797
You know the kind of person
I am.

437
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:21,772
Oh!

438
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:22,940
Crap.

439
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:24,808
Sorry.
I didn't mean to.

440
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,527
It's just, if she sees it,
you know,

441
00:27:26,594 --> 00:27:27,761
my mom will be so pissed.

442
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,396
Yeah.
It was just an accident.

443
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,931
Yeah, well,
she has a temper.

444
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,234
Sometimes.
It's...no big deal.

445
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,568
My dad does, too.

446
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,436
You don't want to see him
when he's drinking.

447
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,243
My mom...

448
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,261
I don't think
she's a good person.

449
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,998
Sometimes I don't think
I'm a good person, either.

450
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,116
You are.

451
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,584
Don't be so sure.

452
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,470
I've been around enough bad

453
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:56,757
to know good when I see it.

454
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,063
It's just she has this...
whole plan for me,

455
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:05,599
but...I don't want
to be like her, you know?

456
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,685
I don't want to be like
my dad, either.

457
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,938
All right.

458
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,441
So then tell me
what's going on.

459
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:17,444
Drop the knife
and I'll show you.

460
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,079
Show me
and I'll drop the knife.

461
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,619
Don't move.

462
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,133
This is Jacob...

463
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,267
my son.

464
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:48,175
I've built a life here,
Sam.

465
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,527
I'm...in the PTA.
I'm boring.

466
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:53,314
- But you're still feeding.
- On the dead.

467
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:55,733
I'm a mortician.

468
00:28:58,186 --> 00:28:59,536
I know.

469
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:02,656
Not sexy, but,
you know, health benefits.

470
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:06,710
I quietly take
what Jacob and I need.

471
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:07,828
No one gets hurt.

472
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,881
But it can be risky,

473
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:13,200
feeding like that,
especially for a kid.

474
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,337
Jacob got sick.

475
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:19,039
He was dying, and the only way
to fight it off was --

476
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,924
He needed fresh meat.

477
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,260
It worked.

478
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,212
- After the last one, his fever broke.
- Amy --

479
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,814
- It's over.
- You can't guarantee that.

480
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:28,315
I give you my word.

481
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:32,236
So, how is spilling more blood
gonna help anyone?

482
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,573
You could still walk away
from this.

483
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:39,360
We both can.

484
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,447
Sam...

485
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,532
After what I did
for you.

486
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,503
- Amy, I --
- Hide! Quick!

487
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,237
What?

488
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:55,376
Hey.

489
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,710
They caught up.

490
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,745
Who caught up?

491
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,631
Couple of pros
in a piece-of-crap Impala.

492
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:05,886
We're leaving.

493
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,221
But, Mom --

494
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,722
I'm only gonna say
this once --

495
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,608
I put the food on this table,
so you will do as you are told

496
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:12,759
or I will let you starve.

497
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,095
Okay.

498
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,532
Gas up the van.
I'll pack.

499
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,108
Good girl.

500
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,218
Awesome first date, huh?

501
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:40,554
Look, I'm sorry you got to
go like this, but...

502
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,058
What's wrong?

503
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,143
Look, I know my mom's --

504
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:48,795
No, I just have to go.
I'm sorry.

505
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:56,803
Oh, that -- that's nothing!
That's just...

506
00:30:57,312 --> 00:30:57,970
Sam?

507
00:30:57,995 --> 00:30:59,627
It's my dad and brother
in the Impala.

508
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:01,975
You're a monster.

509
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,946
You're a hunter.

510
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,664
So...

511
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:08,982
You're supposed to
kill me...

512
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,702
...And I'm supposed to
kill you?

513
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:17,458
I guess.

514
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:21,011
Sam,
I've never killed anyone.

515
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:23,680
And I don't want
to hurt you.

516
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:26,666
Do you want to hurt me?

517
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,772
No.

518
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,476
Then run.

519
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,978
If my mom finds you,
she'll kill you. Just run.

520
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,397
Please, Sam.

521
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,802
Howdy, Sam.

522
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:07,649
New rule. You steal my baby,
you get punched.

523
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:10,104
The hell were you thinking,
Sam, running off like that?

524
00:32:10,171 --> 00:32:11,522
I mean, for all I know,

525
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:13,840
Satan could have been
callin' your plays.

526
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:16,944
Dean, look, how many times
do I have to tell you? I'm fine.

527
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:19,279
Oh, yeah, no, you're
a poster boy for mental health.

528
00:32:19,347 --> 00:32:21,115
You have any idea

529
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:23,033
the kind of horror shows
I had going on in my head?!

530
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:24,485
Dean, I left you a note.

531
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:26,370
There was a job in town.

532
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:27,354
A Kitsune.

533
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:29,456
Yeah. No, I know.

534
00:32:29,524 --> 00:32:32,626
And you ignore Bobby and I's
phone calls why, exactly?

535
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:34,661
Because I wanted
to take care of it.

536
00:32:34,712 --> 00:32:36,213
And I did.
I took care of it.

537
00:32:36,297 --> 00:32:37,698
- Really?
- Yes.

538
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:40,334
Where's the body?

539
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:47,975
There is no body.

540
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:49,092
Why not?

541
00:32:50,645 --> 00:32:53,147
Because I let her go.

542
00:32:53,214 --> 00:32:54,748
She's gone.

543
00:32:54,816 --> 00:32:56,150
You what?

544
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:57,601
Why?

545
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,272
Sam!

546
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,107
I knew
you were hiding something.

547
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,194
See,
we can never blow town

548
00:33:07,245 --> 00:33:09,229
without Amy throwing
a bitch-fit.

549
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,866
So agreeing
to go peacefully -- well.

550
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:14,401
Who is this?

551
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,370
- He's my friend.
- No, he's not.

552
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:17,904
Sam!
Shut up!

553
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,756
What is wrong with you,
huh?

554
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:22,709
You <i>that</i> stupid? Really?

555
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,679
I already told you,
you <i>cannot</i> have friends.

556
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:27,080
This kid is food!

557
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:27,881
No!

558
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:31,885
This'll teach you.

559
00:33:58,046 --> 00:34:00,797
You never told me that.

560
00:34:00,882 --> 00:34:03,417
I never told anyone.

561
00:34:03,484 --> 00:34:07,554
I mean, can you imagine
what dad would have done?

562
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:09,756
So you saw the article
in the newspaper,

563
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:10,957
and you just bolted.

564
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:13,277
It was my mess.

565
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:16,463
And you call letting her go
cleaning it up?

566
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:21,134
She killed her own <i>mom,</i>
<i>Dean, to save me.</i>

567
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:23,820
I hear you, Sam. I do.

568
00:34:23,888 --> 00:34:25,455
But look at her now.

569
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:28,492
She's dropping bodies,
man...

570
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,143
Which means
we got to drop her,

571
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,811
no matter
how many merit badges

572
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:34,781
she racked up
when she was a kid.

573
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:36,867
I'm sorry,
but it's that simple.

574
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:42,756
Nothing in our lives
is simple.

575
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:46,793
You have to run.

576
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:50,997
Amy!

577
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:51,998
Do you have cash?

578
00:34:54,602 --> 00:34:55,886
I-I want you on the first bus
out of town.

579
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,771
Tonight.

580
00:34:57,838 --> 00:34:59,139
- What about --
- I'll take care of her.

581
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:01,858
Just go!

582
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:03,644
Come with me.

583
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:09,066
We don't have to be alone.
We can be freaks together, Sam.

584
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,017
Sam...

585
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,653
I can't.

586
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,123
I'm sorry.

587
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,525
So am I.

588
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:26,083
Look, man, I get it, okay?

589
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,501
You meet a girl,
you feel that spark --

590
00:35:27,552 --> 00:35:29,202
there's nothing better.
But this freak?

591
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:34,841
I didn't mean --
yeah, you did.

592
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:37,427
Look, I see the way
you look at me, Dean,

593
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:38,929
like I'm a grenade

594
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:41,682
and you're waiting
for me to go off.

595
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:43,650
- Sam --
- I'm not going off.

596
00:35:43,718 --> 00:35:44,818
Look, I might be a freak,

597
00:35:44,885 --> 00:35:46,236
but that's not the same
as dangerous.

598
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:49,439
I didn't say --
it's okay.

599
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:50,440
Say it.

600
00:35:52,994 --> 00:35:56,613
I've spent a lot of my life
trying to be normal,

601
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:58,148
but come on.

602
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:00,033
I'm not normal.

603
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,901
Look at all the crap
I've done.

604
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:04,788
Look at me now.
I'm a grade-a freak.

605
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:08,008
But I'm managing it.
And so is Amy.

606
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:10,093
Is she? How?

607
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:12,078
She works
at a damn funeral home

608
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,414
so she doesn't
have to kill anyone, Dean.

609
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:15,882
She's figured out
how to deal.

610
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:17,017
Okay, well,
then explain the bodies.

611
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:18,969
She's done.

612
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:22,639
Her friggin' kid was dying,
Dean.

613
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:24,191
Put you or me
in her position,

614
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:26,259
we'd probably do
the same thing.

615
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,229
Look, you don't trust her.

616
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,281
Fine.

617
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:32,315
Trust <i>me.</i>

618
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:38,338
Dean, please.

619
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:43,043
Okay.

620
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,495
Seriously?

621
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,749
Got to start sometime,
right?

622
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:59,329
Bozeman. Right.

623
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,696
Got it. Thanks.

624
00:37:00,748 --> 00:37:03,416
That was Bobby. We'll hole up
in Spokane tonight.

625
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,001
We'll meet him tomorrow.

626
00:37:05,052 --> 00:37:07,971
Why don't you drive?

627
00:37:08,038 --> 00:37:09,305
You gonna punch me again?

628
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:34,864
Hey, why don't, uh --
why don't you check us in?

629
00:37:34,915 --> 00:37:36,249
I got to hit the candy store.

630
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,567
Doctor's orders.

631
00:37:58,806 --> 00:37:59,922
Next time you run,

632
00:37:59,974 --> 00:38:01,891
you should change
your license plates.

633
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:05,812
Keeping the same tags
makes you easy to track.

634
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:08,197
- Who --
- I'm Sam's brother.

635
00:38:08,265 --> 00:38:11,234
And <i>you</i> are Amy Pond,

636
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:13,069
the Bozeman mortician
who went missing.

637
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,404
There's people
looking for you.

638
00:38:14,455 --> 00:38:16,623
Sam sent you?

639
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:17,940
Sam doesn't know I'm here.

640
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:20,159
But he told you.
My son --

641
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:23,579
I know. I know.

642
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:26,633
But people...

643
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:29,002
They are who they are.

644
00:38:29,086 --> 00:38:31,170
No matter how hard you try,

645
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:34,257
you are what you are.

646
00:38:34,308 --> 00:38:36,592
You will kill again.

647
00:38:36,644 --> 00:38:38,845
I won't. I swear.

648
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:41,848
Trust me, I'm an expert.

649
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:45,401
Maybe in a year, maybe 10.

650
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:48,604
But eventually,
the other shoe will drop.

651
00:38:48,656 --> 00:38:50,940
It always does.

652
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:58,364
I'm sorry.

653
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,774
You got someone
you can go to?

654
00:39:27,978 --> 00:39:30,480
You ever kill anyone?

655
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:36,369
Well, if you do,
I'll come back for you.

656
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:40,189
The only person
I'm gonna kill is you.

657
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:47,330
Well, look me up
in a few years.

658
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:51,084
Assuming I live that long.

659
00:40:08,602 --> 00:40:09,718
Yes, sir.

660
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,105
Sam Winchester
was definitely here.

661
00:40:12,189 --> 00:40:13,222
Yes.

662
00:40:13,273 --> 00:40:15,375
Every alias we have for them,

663
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:17,677
and I'll find out
where they went from here.

664
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:19,512
I'm only
a couple days behind them.

665
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,199
Just grabbing a bite first.

666
00:40:28,405 --> 00:40:32,008
Do you know what I find?

667
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:34,427
Plain old people taste fine,

668
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:38,464
but everything is better...

669
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:40,199
with cheese.
