1
00:00:05,426 --> 00:00:09,379
? Carry on, my wayward son ?

2
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:13,550
? there'll be peace
when you are done ?

3
00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:17,687
? lay your weary head to rest ?

4
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:20,774
? don't you cry no more ?

5
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:23,476
What the hell?
Leviathan!

6
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:32,869
Let's be friends,
you and I.

7
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:34,404
I'd sooner
swim through hot garbage

8
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:36,656
than shake hands with a
bottom-feeding mutation like you.

9
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,377
? Once, I rose above
the noise and confusion ?

10
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:41,711
Bobby!

11
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:44,798
? Just to get a glimpse
beyond this illusion ?

12
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:49,502
? I was soaring ever higher ?

13
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:51,638
? but I flew too high ?

14
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:56,760
? though my eyes could see,
I still was a blind man ?

15
00:00:56,794 --> 00:01:00,313
? though my mind could think,
I still was a madman ?

16
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:03,483
? I hear the voices
when I'm dreaming ?

17
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:04,484
What the hell are you?

18
00:01:04,518 --> 00:01:05,769
He's a Prophet of the Lord.

19
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:07,404
? I can hear them say ?

20
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:08,939
That's the word of God?
Yes.

21
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:10,073
What's "Leviathan"?

22
00:01:10,107 --> 00:01:11,441
You could read it?

23
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:14,527
Hello, Kevin.

24
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:15,862
The only way
to kill Leviathan

25
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:17,731
is with the three bloods
of the fallen --

26
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:18,915
fallen angel blood.

27
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,034
You got to bleed
an Alpha --

28
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:23,787
and blood from the ruler
of fallen humanity.

29
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:24,955
Hello, boys.

30
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,840
- You gonna give us the blood or not?
- Happily.

31
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:28,008
But not quite yet.

32
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:29,659
Well, then when?
Last.

33
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:33,880
? Carry on ?

34
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:36,599
? you will always remember ?

35
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:37,600
? carry on ?

36
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:40,520
? nothing equals the splendor ?

37
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:44,024
? now your life's
no longer empty ?

38
00:01:44,058 --> 00:01:46,509
? surely heaven waits for you ?

39
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:49,512
It's a good thing we got Crowley
in our corner. Right?

40
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,364
Seeing as how
it all comes down to him.

41
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,233
What could
possibly go wrong?

42
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:56,703
- Mr. Crowley.
- Hello.

43
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:02,409
? Don't you cry no more ?

44
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:14,004
- How do you take it?
- Alcoholic.

45
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:16,172
Shall we get on
with this, then?

46
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:18,975
Just extending
the hand of hospitality.

47
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,226
To a mutation like me?

48
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:22,595
Tired of swimming
in hot garbage, are we?

49
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:25,648
That was a little colorful,
huh?

50
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:28,768
Well...

51
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,155
didn't mean to offend.

52
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:33,840
Of course you did.

53
00:02:33,874 --> 00:02:36,826
So, if you're
suddenly calling,

54
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:39,946
I guess you're up to speed
on the Winchesters,

55
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,949
which means
you intercepted the Prophet.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,485
And the Prophet told you

57
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,837
that my blood
is the key to everything.

58
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,346
You know
what I like about you?

59
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,847
Lack of pretension?

60
00:02:57,882 --> 00:02:59,466
You're smarter
than you look.

61
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:01,918
Oh, well,
now you're just flirting.

62
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:04,287
Not easy...to kill me,
but doable.

63
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:05,805
Especially for you lot.

64
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,973
You kill Angels.

65
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:10,276
You can certainly
wipe a demon off the board.

66
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:12,095
And yet, here we are,

67
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:14,114
negotiating
like proper psychopaths.

68
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:16,816
Well, I assume you have a vial
of your blood stashed somewhere,

69
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:18,267
and in the event
of your death,

70
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:19,786
it goes directly
to Sam and Dean.

71
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:23,339
See?
Smart assumption.

72
00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:26,076
One can't live
on looks alone.

73
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,877
Here's my offer.

74
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:29,045
All ears.

75
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,964
Full immunity
for you and your constituency.

76
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:34,167
I'm talking free-range grazing
for all demonkind.

77
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:36,803
I'm willing to cordon off,
say, Canada.

78
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:38,922
You and your crew can work
your little deals,

79
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:40,206
have your way
with the locals.

80
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,591
<i>All</i> of Canada?

81
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,343
Have it.

82
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:44,511
Fair.

83
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:45,595
And down here?

84
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:46,596
America's ours.

85
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,731
Your sales team
stays out -- period.

86
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:51,851
That's not up for negotiation.
We need America.

87
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:53,069
They're so fat.

88
00:03:54,238 --> 00:03:55,405
And in exchange?

89
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:02,996
The blood of
one sadly unimpressive demon

90
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,230
in New Jersey.

91
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:06,516
All I ask is that you give it
to frick and frack,

92
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,586
tell them it's yours,
stand back,

93
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,671
and let them come to me.

94
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:17,293
I can't deny
I long to see those two digested

95
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:18,812
once and for all.

96
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,301
You have a deal.

97
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:27,086
I suppose
you want it in writing?

98
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:28,438
I don't kiss
on the mouth.

99
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:29,672
Your loss.

100
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,394
I just so happen to have
a standard rider...right here.

101
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:40,183
I do so like this part.

102
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,417
Don't you?

103
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:48,544

105
00:04:54,937 --> 00:04:57,406
All right.
Exit's in 3 miles.

106
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,824
I still say
this is a bad idea.

107
00:04:58,858 --> 00:04:59,941
Dean, it was <i>your</i> idea,

108
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:01,993
and it was the best one
either of us had.

109
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:03,245
I said it as a joke.

110
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,996
It was a bad <i>joke --</i>
<i>good</i> <i>idea.</i>

111
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:07,866
Yeah, only because we got
no magic spell, no book --

112
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,535
nothing on how to find
a freakin' righteous bone.

113
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:12,754
We can call Castiel
again.

114
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:15,707
Dude, on my <i>car,</i>
<i>he showed up naked...</i>

115
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:18,510
Covered in bees.

116
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:21,680
Yeah, I'm not really sorry
I missed that.

117
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:24,582
<i>...All-time high</i>

118
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,584
<i>following Roman's acquisition</i>
<i>of Sucrocorp.</i>

119
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:27,803
<i>I say Roman's a buy.</i>

120
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:29,438
<i>Got to disagree</i>
<i>with you there.</i>

121
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:31,022
<i>I'm gonna call him</i>
<i>a "wait and watch."</i>

122
00:05:31,057 --> 00:05:32,357
<i>Come on, Lawshe.</i>
<i>You're killing me.</i>

123
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:33,809
<i>Hear me out.</i>

124
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,094
<i>This is a new sector for Roman.</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

125
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:38,397
<i>He's holed up at Sucrocorp</i>
<i>headquarters right now.</i>

126
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,365
<i>Just sit tight.</i>
<i>This --</i>

127
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:44,703
Holed up at Sucrocorp,
huh?

128
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:10,846
"Should the party
of the first part

129
00:06:10,897 --> 00:06:12,981
"fail to inform
the party of the second part

130
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:13,982
of his intent" --

131
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:15,233
Pause right there.

132
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:17,385
Correct me -- that should be
"party of the second part

133
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,904
vis-?-vis
party of the first part,"

134
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:21,690
'cause we just amended
clause 314-sub-a.

135
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,341
That's right.

136
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:25,744
You should do this
professionally.

137
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:26,862
Splendid.

138
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:31,366
So, "should the party
of the second part

139
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:33,289
Well, I guess if we can't
find a righteous bone

140
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:35,403
in a friggin' nunnery crypt.

141
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,822
All right.
Here -- listen to this.

142
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,159
Sister Mary Benedict
taught the learning-impaired

143
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:42,711
and died at age 23.

144
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,629
Eh, it's a little young.

145
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:46,381
Find someone
who's had time to cook.

146
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:50,318
Okay, well, there was, uh...
here -- Sister Mary Eunice.

147
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:53,939
Uh, fed the poor, became
Mother Superior at age 60.

148
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:56,141
Sounds political.
Power corrupts.

149
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:57,609
Right. Um...

150
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:00,979
Listen to this --

151
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:02,781
Sister Mary Constant,

152
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:05,700
83 years of quiet, humble
nun-like goodness.

153
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:07,118
What do you think?

154
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:10,222
Wow. <i>I</i> want to be more righteous
just reading this.

155
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:11,239
Exactly.

156
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,858
All right,
well, I lay odds on <i>her.</i>

157
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:16,361
Here we go.

158
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,168
Well...

159
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:24,553
let's bone this nun.

160
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:27,372
Sorry.

161
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,847
"...in which case,
the party of the second part

162
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:42,153
forfeits all rights to Canada
ad infinitum."

163
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:43,772
I think we're done here.

164
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:44,823
Susan!

165
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:46,992
Yes, sir.

166
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,910
Take this from Mr. Crowley,
make triplicates,

167
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:50,328
get pens and a notary.

168
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:52,130
We're ready
to sign this puppy.

169
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:09,214
Is he trying to make
a grand entrance or...?

170
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:10,315
I don't know...

171
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:13,718
Son of a bitch.
He's standing us up.

172
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:16,137
Well, we summoned him.
Doesn't he kind of have to --

173
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:18,773
If Crowley wants to screw you,
he'll screw you.

174
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:23,111
Or...he <i>can't</i> come
'cause something went wrong.

175
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:24,112
Maybe.

176
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,701
Maybe it's good news.

177
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:44,716
<i>You</i> deal with him.
I can't anymore.

178
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,002
You might want to be
more specific.

179
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:49,037
I was laying low
halfway across the world

180
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,805
when emo boy pops up
out of nowhere

181
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,307
and zaps me
right back here.

182
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,508
Why?

183
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,599
? Look out on a summer's day ?

184
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:04,853
? with eyes that know
the darkness in my soul ?

185
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:09,641
? shadows on the hills ?

186
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:10,942
? sketch the trees... ?

187
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:11,993
Hey, there.

188
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:18,033
? Catch the breeze
and the winter chills ?

189
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:23,488
? in colors
on the snowy linen land ?

190
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,957
So, Cass, what's, uh,
what's the word?

191
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,595
Well, Dean,
I've been thinking.

192
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,932
Monkeys are so...clever,
and they're sensible

193
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:38,203
in that they leave the skins
on the bananas that they eat.

194
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:42,057
Is it really necessary
to test cosmetics on them?

195
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:45,327
I mean, how important
is lipstick to you, Dean?

196
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:51,900
Not very.

197
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:56,838
You want to come inside and, uh,
tell us what's going on?

198
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,457
Now, you understand

199
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:01,126
I don't participate
in aggressive activity.

200
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:10,001
Mm.
Sister Mary Constant.

201
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:11,703
Good choice.

202
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:13,672
Why'd you go to Meg,
Cass?

203
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:17,208
When I left, I wanted to observe
the flowers -- and fruit.

204
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:20,011
Flowers come first,
obviously.

205
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,647
But I heard nothing
from them.

206
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:24,382
You heard nothing
from who?

207
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,567
The Garrison.

208
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:29,070
What happened
to the Garrison?

209
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:31,389
Well, finally,
the silence was deafening,

210
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:33,525
so I went to look...

211
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,078
to the home
of the Prophet.

212
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:39,447
You know,
Leviathan can kill Angels.

213
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:43,735
There's a reason why
father locked them in Purgatory.

214
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:46,588
They're the...Piranha that
would eat the whole aquarium.

215
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:51,326
They're gone.

216
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,128
The entire Garrison --
dead.

217
00:10:53,162 --> 00:10:56,931
If there's anyone left at all,
they're in hiding.

218
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:58,850
Um, I'm sorry.

219
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:02,103
If the angels are dead,
where's Kevin?

220
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:04,472
I could steal them
from their cages, the monkeys.

221
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:06,691
But where would
I put them all?

222
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:08,526
Hey! Focus.
Is Kevin alive?

223
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:10,945
I don't want to fight.

224
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,864
No, I'm not --

225
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:15,817
we're worried.

226
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:20,255
They took him.
He's alive.

227
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:23,608
I felt such responsibility,
but it's in your hands now.

228
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:25,877
Wait. Hold on a freakin' minute.
I feel much better.

229
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:27,512
Guys, what's all that?

230
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:30,832
We called Crowley.

231
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:31,833
You <i>what?</i>

232
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:33,551
Don't worry.
He never showed.

233
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:35,345
What do you mean "never" --
do you see him anywhere?

234
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,454
He stood us up.

235
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:38,973
Well, I'm sorry about that,
but I'm outie.

236
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,225
He could still sh--

237
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:42,010
Show up at any time.

238
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:43,178
Hello, boys.

239
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:48,650
Sorry I'm late.

240
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,835
This <i>is</i>
<i>an embarrassment of riches.</i>

241
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,064
Stay, won't you.

242
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:06,211
There's really
nowhere to run.

243
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:09,732
Don't even think
of smoking out, pussycat.

244
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:11,066
I've got eyes
all over the place.

245
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:12,284
Leave her be.

246
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:16,188
Castiel.

247
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:21,076
When last we spoke,
you -- well, enslaved me.

248
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:23,662
I'm confused.
Why aren't you dead?

249
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:25,831
I...don't know.

250
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:27,833
Well, do you <i>want</i> to be?
'Cause I can help with that.

251
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:28,918
All right, enough.

252
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:30,369
It's enough when I say.

253
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,921
I came here to help you.

254
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:33,255
I find out
you've been lying to me,

255
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,257
harboring an angel,
and not just <i>any</i> angel --

256
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:39,762
the one angel I most want
to crush between my teeth.

257
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:42,848
Oh, so you can
crush angels now, huh?

258
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:45,301
You bore me.
You know that?

259
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:47,169
You have
no sense of poetry.

260
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:51,857
Now, what do you
have to say for yourself?

261
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:56,228
Well, I'm still, uh, honing
my communication strategy.

262
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,364
I haven't even
been back to heaven.

263
00:12:58,398 --> 00:13:00,699
I-I keep thinking
there are no insects up there,

264
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:02,785
but here we have...
trillions.

265
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:04,904
You know,
they're making honey and silk

266
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:07,189
and...miracles, really.

267
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,791
What are you
talking about?

268
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:12,912
Um, preferring insects
to angels, I guess.

269
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:16,832
Here. I can offer a token,
if you like.

270
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:17,883
It's honey.

271
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,718
I-I collected it myself.

272
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:25,975
You're off your rocker.

273
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:28,978
He's off his rocker --
is that it?

274
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:33,766
Karma's a bitch,
isn't it?

275
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:37,486
Look, did you come here to, uh,
doggy-punch your old grudges

276
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,771
or to help us end Dick?

277
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:39,822
Pick a battle.

278
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:42,074
Well, I'm vexed.

279
00:13:42,108 --> 00:13:44,076
I'd like to do both.

280
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,996
But where's the fun
in clobbering a ball of wet fur?

281
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:51,784
Text me when sparkles here
retrieves his marbles,

282
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:52,785
I suppose.

283
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:54,670
Meanwhile...

284
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:57,189
...a prezzie.

285
00:13:57,224 --> 00:14:00,042
Really? Just boxed-up
and ready to go?

286
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:01,493
I'm a model of efficiency.

287
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:03,062
Is that right?

288
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:04,730
Then why were you late?

289
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:06,482
Dick had me
in a devil trap.

290
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,734
He's not an idiot.

291
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:10,803
He knows
what you two are after.

292
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:11,937
So what did he offer you?

293
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:13,188
A fair deal.

294
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:16,692
In exchange for giving you
the wrong blood...

295
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:19,778
It's demon,
but is it <i>mine?</i>

296
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:23,582
It's my blood.

297
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:26,151
Real deal.

298
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:27,236
And why should
we trust you?

299
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,538
Good God, don't.
Never trust <i>anyone.</i>

300
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:33,709
A lesson I learned
from my last business partner.

301
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:35,294
All right.

302
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:37,296
Give us the blood.

303
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,480
Certainly.

304
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:39,915
Oh, bonus.

305
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:43,218
Meg, I'm gonna scoop you up,
take you home,

306
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:44,887
and roast you
till you're jerky.

307
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:46,839
But not...yet.

308
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,258
Cass can have you for now.

309
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:53,896
Hilariously, it seems
he'd be upset at losing you.

310
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,316
And the boys need Cass
to get Dick.

311
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,318
Don't they, Cass?

312
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:00,986
Oh, I --
I don't fight anymore.

313
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:02,438
Come on.

314
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:04,239
Given the particulars
of your enemy,

315
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:06,492
sadly, you're vital.

316
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,482
Son of a bitch!

317
00:15:46,516 --> 00:15:49,318
Pure iron. Damn it.

318
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:52,287
All right. My mistake.

319
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:53,906
- Let's go.
- No!

320
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,458
You stay away from me.

321
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:58,777
Will you please
let me go home?

322
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:07,669
I need you.

323
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:08,804
No.

324
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:12,758
Powerpoint presentation's
on your desk for approval, sir.

325
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:13,759
Great.

326
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,345
Susan,
do I look like a fool?

327
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:18,547
- Not in that particular body, no.
- Good.

328
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:21,483
Have I told you there are three
rules to contract negotiation?

329
00:16:21,518 --> 00:16:23,435
Bring breath mints,
get it in writing,

330
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:25,854
and have a plan
for when they screw you.

331
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:27,523
Go to the freezer.

332
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:28,524
The arm?

333
00:16:28,558 --> 00:16:30,392
Yep, the arm.
Thatagirl.

334
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:47,009
Sit.

335
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:56,485
I'm Kevin.

336
00:16:58,671 --> 00:16:59,855
Polly.

337
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:04,560
What are you doing here?

338
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:06,145
Sitting.

339
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:07,379
I guess.

340
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:10,098
Are you a prophet?

341
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:22,044
So...

342
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:23,996
basically,
I'm on my own, then.

343
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:28,950
Well, one thing's for sure --
we only get one shot.

344
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:30,419
This thing don't reload.

345
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,721
You think Crowley's,
uh...

346
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:33,889
Double-crossing us?

347
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:34,990
Yeah.

348
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:37,392
You've got to figure
who he wants dead more --

349
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:39,961
us or Dick.

350
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:43,649
Depends
what Dick offered.

351
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:45,184
Here we go.

352
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:50,522
Okay.

353
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:53,442
Um, so do we, uh...

354
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,861
Uh, there's no magic words --
nothing.

355
00:17:55,912 --> 00:17:58,497
You just...just go.

356
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,834
All right, then.

357
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:23,438
Where's all the thunder
and lightning?

358
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,608
Uh...

359
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:27,893
<i>Maybe</i> it worked?

360
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:29,394
Awesome.

361
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:37,185
So, none of this
should cause you any ill effect.

362
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:39,905
I went to a little farm
in Normandy for the wheat

363
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:41,907
and the lettuce and tomato
and --

364
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,159
and I thoroughly examined
and comforted the pig

365
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:47,296
before I...slaughtered it
for the ham.

366
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,366
Here.
You need your strength.

367
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:52,701
Thanks, Cass.

368
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,637
Hey, Cass,
why was Crowley so certain

369
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:57,556
that you need
to come with us?

370
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,058
Crowley's wrong.
I'll be waiting right here.

371
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:03,378
But please --
accept this sandwich

372
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:05,514
as a gesture
of solidarity.

373
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,983
Morning, sir.

374
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:09,935
Delegates are
on their way.

375
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:11,320
Perfect.

376
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:14,406
We're gonna want everything
in place before they get here.

377
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,109
Send in the security detail,
would you?

378
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,118
Nice watch.

379
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:40,432
Get dressed.

380
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:49,358
Why does he
want you to...?

381
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:34,969
I'm a vegan.

382
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,694
You ready, Polly?

383
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:07,769
Well, I'm pleased as punch
to see you all here.

384
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:10,889
Last time we were in one room,
it was inside that angel.

385
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,026
Now, as key players,
I need you up to speed

386
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,561
on every aspect of the program,
not just the sudden influx

387
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:18,747
of happy, delicious stoners
in your neighborhood.

388
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:22,034
Oh. Eat up.

389
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:23,952
The Sushi's
made of fresh orphan.

390
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:28,206
All righty.

391
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:30,125
The slaughterhouses --

392
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,244
cutting-edge, humane,
efficient.

393
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:34,079
First one goes online
next month.

394
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,998
What's
the crowd-control strategy?

395
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:38,467
Glad you asked.

396
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:41,369
We've laid employees at key
junctures of law enforcement,

397
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,004
starting with the 911 call.

398
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,007
Everyone feels taken care of,
everyone stays calm.

399
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,427
We'll up the dose
just before harvest time.

400
00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:49,778
They won't feel a thing.

401
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:53,315
We're taking
a regional approach.

402
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:55,484
Ohio -- beta-testing.

403
00:21:55,518 --> 00:21:57,886
Wisconsin -- processing.

404
00:21:57,904 --> 00:22:00,655
Florida -- breeding program.

405
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,990
If you'll flip to page 10,

406
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:03,608
you'll see we're having a ball
buying fertility clinics.

407
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,059
Real juicy stuff.

408
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:15,504
Why are you
out of your cage, mouse?

409
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:17,172
But now
I want to talk to you

410
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:19,341
about something
I'm really excited about.

411
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:26,298
Everyone...

412
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:27,766
meet Polly.

413
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:38,360
You got it yet?

414
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:39,478
Here we go.

415
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:42,864
Thank you, Charlie,
wherever you are.

416
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:44,149
Got you, Dick.

417
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:47,819
Yeah, that's, uh,
the second floor,

418
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,154
and then --

419
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:50,205
what's that?

420
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:52,157
What the hell?

421
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:53,575
Is that Dick?

422
00:22:55,578 --> 00:22:56,795
And <i>that's</i> Dick.

423
00:22:58,414 --> 00:23:00,165
Son of a bitch.

424
00:23:00,216 --> 00:23:04,586
So, genetic propensity for
these three cancers -- zapped.

425
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,221
She's too stoned to care.

426
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:08,006
Polly, take off your dress.

427
00:23:11,594 --> 00:23:13,845
She's a slip of a thing,
isn't she?

428
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:15,847
And she eats like a linebacker.

429
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:17,899
Bottom line --
we're not making art.

430
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:19,968
We want to engineer
the perfect beast.

431
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:22,521
We want meat, and these
zippy little hummingbirds

432
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:24,689
have to be bred out fast.

433
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:30,162
Additive 3.0.

434
00:23:30,196 --> 00:23:32,164
Keep in mind,
the stuff we're shipping --

435
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:35,750
a little diluted,
longer-acting.

436
00:24:00,476 --> 00:24:02,677
Additive 3.0

437
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:07,399
targets only the characteristics
we want to breed out.

438
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:10,402
It'll be added in nondairy
creamer and multivitamins.

439
00:24:10,436 --> 00:24:12,787
First shipment
heads to Los Angeles tomorrow.

440
00:24:12,822 --> 00:24:14,623
So watch
those dysentery reports.

441
00:24:14,657 --> 00:24:16,825
And stop by the lab
before you go,

442
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:19,744
'cause those creamer cups
are just adorable.

443
00:24:19,795 --> 00:24:21,446
Cycle through again.

444
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,765
That's the maid
from the motel.

445
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:41,816
What motel?

446
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:45,437
Oh, no.

447
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:47,072
Oh, Bobby,
what are you doing?

448
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:48,423
Wait. Are you saying
that Bobby --

449
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:49,824
Look, just, uh,
wait here.

450
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,576
Are you out of your mind?!

451
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:53,912
You got the weapon,
and -- and eyes on Dick, plural.

452
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:55,330
I'll take care of Bobby.

453
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:56,915
Sam! Hey!

454
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:58,450
Shut up.

455
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:26,312
Bobby?

456
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:27,780
I know you're in there.

457
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:30,282
Listen to me.
There are cameras everywhere.

458
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:31,367
There's one right there.

459
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:33,202
Stop, okay?
You're gonna get her killed.

460
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:40,075
Bobby! Damn it!

461
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:42,111
How are you gonna kill Dick,
huh? You can't!

462
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:44,246
Good enough for me.

463
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:48,050
No!
I'm not letting you go.

464
00:25:48,084 --> 00:25:49,502
Get out of here, Sam.
No.

465
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:00,312
Bobby, stop.

466
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:02,231
Stop.

467
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:09,021
No!

468
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:23,035
Okay, thanks.

469
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:25,704
She's fine. Checking out
of the hospital tonight.

470
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:27,423
Well, that's positive.

471
00:26:27,457 --> 00:26:30,175
Tell me again why
you turned tail for some maid.

472
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,961
You were right there.

473
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:33,095
Shut up, Meg.

474
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:35,214
Because
Dick made more Dicks.

475
00:26:37,684 --> 00:26:40,636
He must've kept a chunk of the
original Dick Roman somewhere.

476
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,187
They'd all
have to touch it.

477
00:26:42,222 --> 00:26:43,389
Hey, shifty,
what's your problem?

478
00:26:46,175 --> 00:26:47,393
We need a cat.

479
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:49,929
Doesn't this place feel
one species short?

480
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:53,866
You got anything to say
on the topic of Dicks?

481
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:57,202
Crowley was pretty sure
that you could help.

482
00:26:57,237 --> 00:26:58,520
I <i>can't</i> help.

483
00:26:58,538 --> 00:27:00,289
You understand?
I can't.

484
00:27:00,323 --> 00:27:02,575
I destroyed...everything,

485
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:05,828
and I will
destroy everything <i>again.</i>

486
00:27:05,862 --> 00:27:07,963
Can we please
just leave it at that?

487
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:11,667
No.

488
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:12,701
No, we can't.
Dean...

489
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,053
We can't leave it.

490
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:16,221
You let
these friggin' things in.

491
00:27:16,256 --> 00:27:18,307
So you don't
get to make a sandwich.

492
00:27:18,341 --> 00:27:19,758
You don't get
a damned cat.

493
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,894
Nobody cares
that you're broken, Cass.

494
00:27:21,928 --> 00:27:23,045
Clean up your mess!

495
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:28,484
You know...

496
00:27:32,238 --> 00:27:33,772
we should play Twister.

497
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:40,496
Nice.

498
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,899
You scared off
the Empire's only hope.

499
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,334
Meaning?

500
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:48,253
It occur to you every one
of those things was <i>in</i> Cass?

501
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:50,005
He knows them.

502
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,174
He can see
past the meat suits.

503
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,546
So, he'll be able to spot
the real...fake Dick Roman.

504
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,466
Gold star, sugarpants.

505
00:28:00,517 --> 00:28:03,919
Too bad he's Fruit Loops.
You might've had a chance.

506
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:11,527
There's no real point
in looking for a tell.

507
00:28:11,561 --> 00:28:12,928
They all downloaded
Dick's brain.

508
00:28:12,946 --> 00:28:14,446
They've all got
the same tells.

509
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:16,264
All right,
then maybe the question is,

510
00:28:16,282 --> 00:28:18,433
what would the real Dick
be doing?

511
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:20,035
Is that the best
you can do?

512
00:28:21,037 --> 00:28:21,904
Idjits.

513
00:28:21,938 --> 00:28:24,289
Bobby.
We didn't know if you --

514
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:25,457
Well, you should've.

515
00:28:25,492 --> 00:28:27,660
You got the flask.

516
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:29,662
Dumb.

517
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:32,164
You should've burned it
right off.

518
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,433
Bobby --

519
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:37,119
I'm still Jonesing
to go back...

520
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:38,837
grab some poor bastard,

521
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:42,391
kamikaze 'em
going after Dick.

522
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:46,128
It's bad.

523
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:47,930
<i>America is for go-getters.</i>

524
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:50,465
<i>Folks who get off their butts</i>
<i>and make it happen.</i>

525
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:56,238
Let's be real.

526
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:59,024
I damn near killed you.

527
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:00,192
<i>And</i> that woman.

528
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:01,844
It wasn't your fault, Bobby --
not really.

529
00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:03,112
Right.

530
00:29:03,146 --> 00:29:06,982
That's just
what ghosts turn into.

531
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,836
I really bet the farm
I could outsmart that.

532
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:13,455
So, what's it feel like?

533
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,058
What? Going vengeful?

534
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:21,847
It's an itch
you can't scratch out.

535
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:27,603
Look...

536
00:29:27,637 --> 00:29:29,722
I'm done.

537
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:32,941
Go get Dick.

538
00:29:32,976 --> 00:29:36,278
But don't do it 'cause you think
it'll scratch the itch.

539
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:39,398
Do it 'cause it's the job.

540
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,989
And when it's your time...

541
00:29:47,023 --> 00:29:48,340
Go.

542
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:10,562
Here's to...

543
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:13,215
running into you guys
on the other side.

544
00:30:15,051 --> 00:30:17,152
Only...

545
00:30:17,187 --> 00:30:19,104
not too soon.

546
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:20,606
All right?

547
00:31:55,852 --> 00:31:57,168
Cass,
I need a wingman.

548
00:31:57,186 --> 00:31:58,437
Dean...

549
00:31:58,471 --> 00:32:00,439
You don't want to jump
into the jaws of death,

550
00:32:00,473 --> 00:32:02,507
that's...fine.

551
00:32:03,893 --> 00:32:05,844
How about we run
a little errand?

552
00:32:16,622 --> 00:32:18,073
Thanks for the lift.

553
00:32:18,124 --> 00:32:19,708
My pleasure.

554
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:20,792
Dean...

555
00:32:20,827 --> 00:32:22,961
Cass,
we've been over it.

556
00:32:22,995 --> 00:32:24,663
I get it --
you can't help.

557
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:28,032
If we attack Dick
and fail,

558
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,218
then you and Sam die heroically,
correct?

559
00:32:31,971 --> 00:32:33,338
I don't know.
I guess.

560
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:36,224
And at best, I die trying to fix
my own stupid mistake.

561
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:39,344
Or...I <i>don't</i> die --
I'm brought back again.

562
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:41,930
I see now.
It's a punishment resurrection.

563
00:32:41,981 --> 00:32:43,315
It's worse every time.

564
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:45,167
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:47,152
Uh, we're talking
about God crap, right?

566
00:32:47,186 --> 00:32:48,987
I'm not good luck,
Dean.

567
00:32:49,021 --> 00:32:51,106
Yeah,
but you know what?

568
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,324
Bottom of the ninth,

569
00:32:52,358 --> 00:32:54,326
and you're the only guy
left on the bench...

570
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,913
Sorry, but I'd rather have you,
cursed or not.

571
00:32:57,947 --> 00:33:00,248
And anyway,
nut up, all right?

572
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:01,283
We're <i>all</i> cursed.

573
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:03,084
I seem like good luck
to you?

574
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:07,005
What?

575
00:33:08,257 --> 00:33:10,926
Well, I don't want
to make you uncomfortable,

576
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,128
but I detect
a note of forgiveness.

577
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:18,066
Yeah, well, I'm probably
gonna die tomorrow, so...

578
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:21,019
Well,
I'll go with you.

579
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:24,723
And I'll do my best.

580
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,226
Thanks.

581
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,261
So...

582
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,980
can I ask the plan?

583
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:37,035
Well, according to Crowley,
Dick knows we're coming,

584
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:40,438
so we're gonna
announce ourselves -- big.

585
00:33:49,882 --> 00:33:53,385
? Get your motor runnin' ?

586
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:56,755
? head out on the highway ?

587
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:58,957
? lookin' for adventure ?

588
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:01,843
? in whatever comes our way ?

589
00:34:03,229 --> 00:34:05,680
? yeah, darlin',
go and make it happen ?

590
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:09,651
? Take the world
in a love embrace ?

591
00:34:09,685 --> 00:34:12,354
? fire all your guns at once ?

592
00:34:12,405 --> 00:34:15,607
? and explode into space ?

593
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:19,077
? like a true nature's child ?

594
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:22,364
? we were born,
born to be wild ?

595
00:34:22,415 --> 00:34:25,033
? we can climb so high ?

596
00:34:25,084 --> 00:34:27,819
? I never wanna die ?

597
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:12,097
Later, ho nuggets.

598
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:44,779
The King of Hell
will see you now.

599
00:35:48,868 --> 00:35:50,368
Kevin. Hey, buddy.

600
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:52,253
We got to hustle, okay?

601
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,289
Wait.
We can't leave yet.

602
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,757
Uh, yeah, we can.
It's okay. We got to go.

603
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:57,542
You don't understand.
Dick's got creamer in his lab.

604
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,711
- He's gonna kill all the skinny people.
- Wait. What? Slow down.

605
00:35:59,745 --> 00:36:02,514
We have to blow up
the lab, Sam.

606
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:03,465
Please.

607
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:06,584
Yeah, fine. Let's go.

608
00:36:06,602 --> 00:36:07,886
You know,
I think this might end up

609
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,638
the slickest little genocide
in history.

610
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,756
Thank you, sir.

611
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:12,941
Just sayin'.

612
00:36:12,975 --> 00:36:16,027
I smell "promotion."

613
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:29,791
Little abrupt...
but okay.

614
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:31,910
Castiel.

615
00:36:31,944 --> 00:36:33,712
Good to see you again.

616
00:36:33,746 --> 00:36:36,631
Thanks for the ride
into paradise.

617
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:40,668
And good on you!

618
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,254
Pulling that together --
A-plus.

619
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:45,890
Oh, you don't think
this'll work, do you?

620
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:48,643
You trust that demon?

621
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:49,961
You sure I'm even me,
Dean?

622
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:51,513
No.

623
00:36:51,564 --> 00:36:52,764
But <i>he</i> is.

624
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:56,768
See, here's the thing
when dealing with Crowley --

625
00:36:56,802 --> 00:37:00,488
he will <i>always</i> find a way
to bone you.

626
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:02,190
This meeting's over.

627
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:23,178
Did you really think
you could trump <i>me?</i>

628
00:37:23,212 --> 00:37:24,662
Honestly?

629
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:27,215
No.

630
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:34,889
Figured we'd have to
catch you off guard.

631
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:14,553
Sam, we should go.

632
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:16,338
What the hell?

633
00:38:16,372 --> 00:38:18,307
More chompers any second,
Sam.

634
00:38:18,341 --> 00:38:20,426
Not to worry.

635
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:24,230
I have a small army of demons
outside.

636
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:29,268
Cut off the head, and the body
will flounder, after all.

637
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:32,988
Think if <i>you'd</i> had just one king
since before the first sunrise.

638
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:34,723
You'd be in a kerfuffle,
too.

639
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:37,693
Which is exactly
what you wanted.

640
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:38,577
So did you.

641
00:38:39,396 --> 00:38:43,332
Without a master plan, the Levis
are just another monster.

642
00:38:43,366 --> 00:38:46,452
Hard to stomp, sure,
but you love a challenge.

643
00:38:46,486 --> 00:38:49,255
<i>Your</i> job is to keep them
from organizing.

644
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,756
Where's Dean?

645
00:38:52,325 --> 00:38:55,211
That bone...
has a bit of a kick.

646
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:56,762
God weapons often do.

647
00:38:56,796 --> 00:38:58,631
They should put a warning
on the box.

648
00:38:58,682 --> 00:38:59,682
Where are they,
Crowley?!

649
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:02,017
Can't help you, Sam.

650
00:39:05,138 --> 00:39:07,640
Sorry, Sam.
Prophet's mine.

651
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:12,228
You got
what you wanted --

652
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:15,531
Dick's dead,
saved the world.

653
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:17,650
So I want
one little prophet.

654
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:19,235
Sorry, moose.

655
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:20,703
Wish I could help.

656
00:39:20,737 --> 00:39:23,789
You certainly got a lot
on your plate right now.

657
00:39:23,823 --> 00:39:27,076
It looks like
you are well and truly...

658
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,277
on your own.

659
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:56,155
Wake up.

660
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:03,913
Good.

661
00:40:03,947 --> 00:40:06,282
We need
to get out of here.

662
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:07,833
Where are we?

663
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:09,034
You don't know?

664
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,454
Last I remember,
we ganked Dick.

665
00:40:12,488 --> 00:40:14,656
And where would <i>he</i> go
in death?

666
00:40:16,376 --> 00:40:17,710
Wait.
Are you telling me...?

667
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:19,945
Every soul here
is a monster.

668
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,597
This is where they come

669
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:23,382
to prey upon each other
for all eternity.

670
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:26,201
We're in Purgatory?

671
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,771
How do we get out?

672
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:31,023
I'm afraid we're much more
likely to be ripped to shreds.

673
00:40:36,896 --> 00:40:38,847
Cass,
I think we'd better --

674
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,951
Cass?

675
