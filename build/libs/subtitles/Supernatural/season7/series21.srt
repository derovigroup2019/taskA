1
00:00:02,737 --> 00:00:04,171
I am inside you.

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:06,907
Is it me,
or is this just like the cage?

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,180
Meg.

4
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,515
So, Dean, what's poor, dead
Castiel doing in that junker

5
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:16,583
out there?

6
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:18,668
He doesn't know he's Cass.
I know.

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,054
So, here's the deal --
I need friends.

8
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:22,255
We go straight to Sam.

9
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:23,723
So, you're saying
there's nothing?

10
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:25,758
This isn't a problem
I can make disappear.

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,944
But I may be able
to shift it.

12
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,097
I don't know.
I mean, we can't just leave him.

13
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,732
Well, we can't
bring him with us.

14
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:35,202
Everything on the planet's
out for us, okay? This is safer.

15
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:37,604
Welcome to the team,
Nurse Masters.

16
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:40,490
So Dick's funding
an archaeological dig?

17
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:42,275
Outstanding.

18
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:44,794
You will call as soon as
the package is in hand.

19
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,997
I don't know. Whatever it is,
he wants it bad,

20
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:48,999
which means we got to grab it --
end of story.

21
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:52,419
I've been looking for this
for a very, very long time.

22
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:57,007
- So now what?
- That's a good question.

23
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:59,926
Why don't we answer that a few
thousand miles away from here, though?

24
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:00,287
Hey, Kevin.

25
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,222
Princeton just adjusted
its acceptance rate

26
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,241
down to 8.7% for 2013.
Breathe, Kevin.

27
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:05,692
Are you studying?

28
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:07,026
I'm talking to you.

29
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:10,297
I'll start on probability
and statistics in 14 minutes.

30
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:11,548
I hate probability.

31
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,633
Tomorrow's my last chance
to get a perfect math score.

32
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:14,901
Your S.A.T.s are great!

33
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:16,453
Channing, everybody's S.A.T.s
are great.

34
00:02:16,455 --> 00:02:17,870
I have to do perfect.

35
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,723
Who knows?

36
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:21,808
The essays are at least
as important.

37
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:28,515
I have absolutely
nothing to say.

38
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:30,433
I know.
I know what you mean.

39
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:32,936
I read one by a kid
who got into Cornell.

40
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:35,605
He didn't have any arms
or legs or anything.

41
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:38,391
He had to type the whole thing
with his mouth.

42
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:40,193
It was beautiful.

43
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:42,912
I am so screwed.

44
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:47,968
You know, no matter what,
one day,

45
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,020
college isn't going to matter
anymore.

46
00:02:50,022 --> 00:02:51,955
You're out of your mind.

47
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,581
That's a lot of fuss
over a caveman lego.

48
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,799
Yeah.

49
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:06,603
Well, whatever Dick wants
is bricked up inside that.

50
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,964
All right.

51
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:45,458
That sound like somebody saying,
"no, wait -- stop" to you?

52
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,762
Uh...Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:50,947
Yeah.

54
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,684
Oh, well.

55
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:29,233

57
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:05,371
I don't know.

58
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,574
I think the line might panic
when they turn this corner,

59
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,793
see the blade assembly
up ahead.

60
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:16,666
Strange, isn't it,

61
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:18,718
that someone would choose
to be named "Dick"?

62
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,574
Yes?

63
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:30,480
This is Kevin Tran's voicemail.

64
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:32,148
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

65
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:35,434
<i>Kevin, it's mom.</i>

66
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,269
<i>I know</i>
<i>you're at school already,</i>

67
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,437
<i>about to take the test.</i>

68
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,073
<i>And I know all your hard work</i>

69
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:41,774
<i>will net the results we've discussed...</i>
Wait! What?!

70
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,326
<i>...but like Dr. Ender said,</i>

71
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:46,245
<i>don't obsess on</i>
<i>the "perfect."</i>

72
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:47,613
No. No. No!

73
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,466
<i>That's just a nice feather</i>
<i>in our cap, if we get it.</i>

74
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:53,252
<i>Now, Kevin, we're about to</i>
<i>finish up our last seminar.</i>

75
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:55,287
My flight's confirmed for 7:00,

76
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,307
<i>so I'll see you</i>
<i>at breakfast tomorrow.</i>

77
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:00,459
<i>Love you, honey.</i>

78
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,232
<i>...At a lost to explain</i>
<i>the continent-wide storm system</i>

79
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:08,351
<i>that appeared</i>
<i>seemingly out of nowhere,</i>

80
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:10,469
<i>blanketing</i>
<i>a good part of the nation</i>

81
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:11,904
<i>in freak lightning displays.</i>

82
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:15,158
<i>Here with Dr. Marlon Price of</i>
<i>the U.S. Meteorological Society</i>

83
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,694
<i>had a press conference</i>
<i>earlier today.</i>

84
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:20,613
<i>"Baffled"?</i>
<i>No, I'm not baffled.</i>

85
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:21,948
Frankly, I'm offended.

86
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,434
<i>This is not the way</i>
<i>weather behaves.</i>

87
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,378
Bobby?

88
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,349
Bobby, that you?

89
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:42,018
Think so.

90
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,438
But that whole adventure
at Roman's

91
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,506
seems to have drained
his batteries.

92
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:53,512
So, what?

93
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,448
We start the storm
heard 'round the world?

94
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,366
When we broke this thing open
last night,

95
00:06:57,368 --> 00:07:01,003
every maternity ward within a
hundred-mile radius got slammed.

96
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,022
Looks like any woman in
the last month of her pregnancy

97
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:04,373
went into labor.

98
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,858
Hmm.

99
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,544
This one goes out
to all the ladies.

100
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:12,014
So, heavyweight signs, omens --
what do we got?

101
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,216
I assume it's writing.

102
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:15,451
I've never seen
anything like it, ever.

103
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:18,421
And it doesn't match anything
in any book or online.

104
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,556
All right, so big daddy chomper
lands here,

105
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:22,225
he grabs himself
some dick...

106
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:23,542
And then he starts

107
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,728
secretly underwriting
university departments,

108
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,547
pouring money into digs --
all for this.

109
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:29,699
Why?

110
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:32,235
No clue.

111
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:35,221
We do know that
he will be tearing new ones

112
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:37,573
until he gets it back,
though.

113
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:39,058
Look,
we got to take a minute,

114
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,210
hole up somewhere safe,
find out what we've got.

115
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,979
Rufus' cabin, then?

116
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:43,880
Yeah.

117
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:46,732
This time,
I'm doing the shopping.

118
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:52,288
It's Meg.

119
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:54,874
What?

120
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:56,058
What up, Bullwinkle?

121
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,828
Just a little FYI call.
Your boy's awake.

122
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,229
What? Cass is awake.

123
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,181
When? When?

124
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:03,432
Last night about 8:00.

125
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:05,635
And you waited till now
to call us?

126
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:07,186
I've been busy with Cass.

127
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:10,256
He's just a tad different
than when he dozed off, 'kay?

128
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:12,074
What do you mean,
different?

129
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,477
Hey, Seacrest, guess what --
not a nurse.

130
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,445
Just playing one on TV.

131
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:19,932
Want answers? Start driving.

132
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:23,486
Great.

133
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:25,154
So, Indiana?

134
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:26,589
Yeah.

135
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:29,692
8:00 last night.

136
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,027
Yeah.

137
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:34,163
Same time
we opened up that thing.

138
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,166
Aah! Aah!

139
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:41,220
Aah!

140
00:08:42,974 --> 00:08:44,123
Hello?

141
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,458
Kevin? Where were you today?
You missed the test!

142
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,626
I...

143
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,512
And student council
and quartet.

144
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:51,130
I had to take
my mom's car.

145
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:53,649
I think I had a seizure
or something.

146
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:58,688
I've been chosen.
It's my birthright.

147
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,940
Oh, my God, Kevin, all
the pressure you've been under.

148
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:03,109
This isn't one of those
overachiever-teen meltdowns,

149
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:04,193
is it?

150
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:07,864
I'm supposed to keep going.

151
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:09,365
I'm not allowed to stop.

152
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:11,000
What do you mean,
"not allowed"?

153
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:14,237
Is someone with you?

154
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,639
They didn't make you take
your mother's car, did they?

155
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,824
Kevin?!

156
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,858
We raced all the way here.
Now I don't know.

157
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,243
I can't say I'm fired up
to see what's left of the guy.

158
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:43,745
You think he remembers
at all?

159
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:45,413
That, and I'm guessing

160
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:48,083
whatever kind of hell baggage
he lifted off of your plate.

161
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:49,751
It's not gonna be pretty.

162
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:52,987
Hey. Excuse me, gentlemen, but
it's way past visiting hours.

163
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:56,775
It's okay, Abel.
I've been expecting them.

164
00:09:57,743 --> 00:10:00,011
Hello, boys.

165
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:12,140
Hey, Cass.

166
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:23,868
Hello, Dean.

167
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:28,073
Sam.

168
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,974
Hey, Castiel.

169
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:32,844
Look at you,
walkin' and talkin'.

170
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:35,413
That's -- that's great,
right?

171
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:41,703
Pull my finger.

172
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:45,106
What?

173
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:46,641
My finger --

174
00:10:46,643 --> 00:10:49,043
pull it.

175
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:10,565
Just hang on, Cass. Wait.

176
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,917
Let us catch up to you
for a second.

177
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:17,038
So, you're saying you remember
who you are, what you are.

178
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,256
Yes. Of course.

179
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:20,458
Oh.

180
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,295
Outside today, in the garden,
I followed a honeybee.

181
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:26,214
I saw the route of flowers.

182
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:28,967
It's all right there,
the whole plan.

183
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:30,618
There's nothing to add.

184
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,420
You might want to add
a little thorazine.

185
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:33,872
Right?

186
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:36,541
He's been like the naked guy at
the rave ever since he woke up.

187
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:37,892
Totally useless.

188
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:40,311
Will you look at her?
My caretaker.

189
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:45,450
All of that thorny pain.
So beautiful.

190
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:48,102
We've been over this.
I don't like poetry.

191
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:49,204
Put up or shut up.

192
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:50,572
Okay.

193
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:52,907
So, Cass, you said
you woke up last night?

194
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:53,992
Yes.

195
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:57,412
I heard a ping that pierced me,
and, well,

196
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:58,779
you wouldn't have heard it

197
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:01,115
unless you were an Angel
at the time.

198
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:06,487
That's also
when we opened this.

199
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:09,541
Oh. Of course.
Now I understand.

200
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:11,226
Understand what?

201
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:12,927
You're the ones.

202
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:14,295
Well...

203
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:16,514
...I guess that makes sense.

204
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:18,316
What makes sense?

205
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:21,302
If someone was going to
free the Word

206
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:25,690
from the vault of the earth,
it would end up being you two.

207
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,141
I love you guys.

208
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:27,992
Oh.

209
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:28,976
Uck.

210
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:30,912
All right. All right.
Okay.

211
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:32,146
Yeah, yeah.

212
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:33,698
You said something about
"The Word."

213
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,099
Is that what's written
on there?

214
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,302
Did you know
that a cat's penis

215
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,170
is sharply barbed
along its shaft?

216
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:42,624
I know for a fact the females
were not consulted about that.

217
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,429
Cass, please, we're losing
ground out there, okay?

218
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:50,181
We need your help.

219
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:51,583
Can you not see that?

220
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:54,135
This is the handwriting
of Metatron.

221
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:56,521
Metatron?

222
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:59,057
You saying
a Transformer wrote that?

223
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,341
No. That's <i>Megatron.</i>

224
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:01,276
What?!

225
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:03,027
The Transformer --
it's Megatron.

226
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,562
What?

227
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:05,530
Metatron.

228
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:07,232
He's an Angel.

229
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:08,700
He's the scribe of God.

230
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:12,153
He took down dictation
when creation was being formed.

231
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:13,454
And that's
the word of God?

232
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:15,373
One of them, yes.

233
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,660
Uh...Well,
what's it say, then?

234
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:21,379
Uh...

235
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,364
"Tree"?

236
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:30,088
"Horse"? "Fiddler crab"?
I can't read it.

237
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,339
It wasn't meant for angels.

238
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:33,057
Okay,
this all sounds bad.

239
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,144
What are you two jackasses
doing with the word of God?

240
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:38,146
Let me see that thing.

241
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:39,731
Back off, Meg.

242
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,049
Come on,
it's my ass, too.

243
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:42,900
Back off.

244
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:44,218
Damn it!

245
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,537
Enough of this "demons
are second-class citizens" crap!

246
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:47,789
Don't like conflict.

247
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:51,909
Uh...

248
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,161
What the hell was that?

249
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:55,246
You heard him.
He doesn't like conflict.

250
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:57,615
He's down in the dayroom now.
I guarantee it.

251
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,900
All right,
I'll go handle Cass.

252
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:02,837
Sam, will you please pick up
the word of God?

253
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,456
Yeah.

254
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:08,793
What are you guys
caught up in now?

255
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,714
I deserve to know, Sam.

256
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:19,037
Okay, fine.

257
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,422
I'll hit the road, then.

258
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:23,941
Let me
just go get my angel.

259
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:29,597
Meg, what are you talking about?
Stop.

260
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:32,933
We both call, who do you think
Cass will come to?

261
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:34,285
I'm guessing me.

262
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:38,039
You heard him --
thorny beauty, blah, blah.

263
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,074
I'm the Saint
who stayed with him.

264
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:42,727
He owes me.
His words.

265
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:44,095
Yeah, what about
what he owes us?

266
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:45,680
Well,
work on him a little.

267
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:48,299
Maybe he'll start crushing
on you, too, hot stuff.

268
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,385
What are you gonna do with
a broken angel? Don't be stupid.

269
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:52,286
I'll take power
where I can get it.

270
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:54,105
I've got myself
to look out for.

271
00:15:03,298 --> 00:15:05,266
What the hell?

272
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:27,789
Hey!

273
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:37,014
Aah!

274
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:42,336
Not a demon or a chomper.
What the hell are you?

275
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:46,841
I'm a...
K-Kevin Tran.

276
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:50,361
I'm in advanced placement.
P-p-p-p-please don't kill me.

277
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:52,363
I'm not gonna kill you.

278
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,951
I'm sorry.

279
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:01,856
I-I'm sorry. I...

280
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:07,295
I don't -- I don't know why,
but I can't let go of this.

281
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:24,912
You realize you just
broke God's word?

282
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:37,808
It's Sam's thing,
isn't it?

283
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:44,332
You taking on his, uh,
cage-match scars.

284
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:47,618
I'm guessing that's what
broke your bank, right?

285
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,789
Well, it took...
everything to get me here.

286
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,426
What are you talking about,
man?

287
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:58,429
Dean, I know you want
different answers.

288
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:00,514
No, I want you
to button up your coat

289
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:02,650
and help us
take down Leviathans.

290
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:09,774
Do you remember
what you did?

291
00:17:32,648 --> 00:17:34,398
Do you want to go first?

292
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:38,002
You really stepped in it,
kid.

293
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:39,637
Oh, man.

294
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:43,674
All I know is,
this is -- it's for me.

295
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:46,594
I'm supposed to keep it.

296
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:48,379
Good luck.

297
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:51,532
But you don't know
what it is?

298
00:17:55,804 --> 00:17:57,254
Open it.

299
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,248
You know,
we weren't sure at first

300
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,751
which monkeys
were gonna make it.

301
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:30,337
No offense, but I was backing
the Neanderthals

302
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:33,024
because their poetry
was...just amazing.

303
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:37,044
It's in perfect tune
with the spheres.

304
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:40,181
But in the end,
it was you --

305
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:42,299
the homo sapiens sapiens.

306
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:46,103
You guys ate the apple,
invented pants.

307
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:47,855
Cass, where do we find this,
uh, Metatron?

308
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:49,089
Is he still alive?

309
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:51,642
I'm sorry. I -- I think
you have to go back to start.

310
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:58,282
This is important.

311
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:09,043
I think Metatron could stop
a lot of bad.

312
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:10,211
You understand that?

313
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:13,798
We live in
a "sorry" universe.

314
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,450
It's engineered
to create conflict.

315
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:19,503
I mean, why should I
prosper from...

316
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:21,121
your misfortune?

317
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:25,042
But these are the rules.

318
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:26,510
I didn't make them.

319
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:28,012
You made some of them.

320
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:29,797
When you tried
to become God,

321
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,266
when you cut that hole
into that wall.

322
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:33,684
Dean...

323
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,688
...it's your move.

324
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,972
Forget the damn game!

325
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:49,116
Forget the game, Cass.

326
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:53,170
I'm sorry, Dean.

327
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,456
No.

328
00:19:55,458 --> 00:20:00,027
You're <i>playing</i> "Sorry""

329
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:05,149
It's writing.

330
00:20:05,151 --> 00:20:06,267
Yeah. Yeah, we get that.

331
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:08,819
What's Leviathan?

332
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:11,605
What? You can read it?
Is that what it says?

333
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:13,541
Sort of.
It hurts a little.

334
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:15,342
Like looking through
somebody else's glasses,

335
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:16,377
but I think it...

336
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:19,563
It's about Leviathan,
how it came to be.

337
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:24,034
God locked him up far away,
right?

338
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:27,705
Like in jail...
Because they're so...

339
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:29,356
they're...

340
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:34,478
...they're real,
aren't they?

341
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,881
Yeah, Kevin. They -- they are.
And they're here.

342
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:39,800
Does it say anything
about how to kill them?

343
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:42,970
'Cause that's --
that's kind of been a problem.

344
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:45,039
I don't know.
It's not like <i>reading</i> reading.

345
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,824
It -- it's hard to focus
on it too long.

346
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:49,593
Sam.
Something's up.

347
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:51,712
What?

348
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:53,898
Aah!

349
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,100
Kevin, hey, hey, hey.

350
00:20:56,102 --> 00:20:56,984
Kevin.

351
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:00,905
Demon.

352
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,650
What?

353
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:13,918
Sam.

354
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,738
He's talking to angels.

355
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,541
A demon whore
and a Winchester...again.

356
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,263
Step away
from the Prophet!

357
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:28,649
Who? Who, me?

358
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:31,552
Sole keeper of the word on
earth, we are here to take you.

359
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:32,686
What do you mean, "take"?

360
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:34,421
Kill the demon
and her lover.

361
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:37,057
That's not how it --
we're not --

362
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:41,445
Where did you get that?!

363
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:49,103
Castiel?

364
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:51,872
Hi.

365
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:54,608
You're alive?

366
00:21:57,929 --> 00:21:59,630
You.

367
00:22:00,882 --> 00:22:01,782
Hello, Hester.

368
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:04,001
You smote thousands
in Heaven.

369
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:07,504
You gave a big, scary speech.
Then you were gone.

370
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,974
What the hell was that?!

371
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:12,726
Rude, for one thing.

372
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:15,562
Where have you been?

373
00:22:15,564 --> 00:22:17,197
Oh, Inias.

374
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:19,049
Hester, I...

375
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:21,986
I know you want something --

376
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:24,071
answers.

377
00:22:24,073 --> 00:22:25,522
I...

378
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:27,458
I wish it could be that --

379
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,195
there are still many things
I can teach you.

380
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:35,966
I can offer, um,
well, perspective.

381
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:37,001
Here.

382
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:38,619
Pull my finger.

383
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:42,373
Uh...

384
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,323
Uh...

385
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:45,175
Meg will -- will get
another light,

386
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:46,377
and I'll --
I'll blow it out again.

387
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:48,829
And, well, this time,
it'll be funny,

388
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:51,015
and we'll all look back
and laugh.

389
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:55,936
You're insane.

390
00:22:55,938 --> 00:22:57,504
Hey.

391
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,139
Heads up, Sunshine.

392
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:09,817
All angels blown back
to their corners.

393
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:12,319
We got like
three, four hours tops.

394
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:14,271
Meg,
where did you get that?

395
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,906
A lot of angels
died this year.

396
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:17,458
What's happening?!

397
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:22,830
What's happening?!

398
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:24,665
What is that?

399
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:28,135
It's, uh...
Kevin Tran.

400
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:32,556
He's, uh,
in advanced placement.

401
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:44,699
So, these Leviathans --
these monsters are real.

402
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:47,786
And angels with wings?

403
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:48,787
No. Uh...

404
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:51,139
No wings.
No anything.

405
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:53,374
No junk.
Junkless.

406
00:23:53,376 --> 00:23:56,327
So, Kevin, you can, uh,
read the chicken scratch

407
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:57,929
on the God rock, huh?

408
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:00,465
That is back in one piece,
I see.

409
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:02,584
And you're saying
that there's some sort of

410
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:05,086
a "How to punch Dick"
recipe in there somewhere?

411
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:06,838
I don't know
what you're saying,

412
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,058
but it seems kind of like
an "in case of emergency" note.

413
00:24:11,677 --> 00:24:13,711
What did they mean
by "Prophet"?

414
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:15,230
Oh, no. Really?

415
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:16,765
Yeah. Yeah,
that's what the angel said.

416
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:18,817
I don't want to be a Prophet.

417
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:19,934
No. You don't at all.

418
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:22,654
Gentlemen, we've got to
start running and hiding.

419
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:25,406
Or do you want to tangle
with those wing nuts twice?

420
00:24:25,408 --> 00:24:27,242
I'm sorry.
Did you say "we"?

421
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:29,077
I'm on the angels' radar
now.

422
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:31,830
You think I don't need
a little safety in numbers?

423
00:24:31,832 --> 00:24:33,698
All right,
we'll go to Rufus' cabin.

424
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,617
Kid can do his book report
there.

425
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:56,271
<i>We know you're hungry.</i>

426
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:58,940
<i>Why not enjoy</i>
<i>Biggerson's homemade pie bar?</i>

427
00:24:58,942 --> 00:25:01,759
<i>It's like a salad bar</i>
<i>but with pie.</i>

428
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,695
<i>Now back to</i>
<i>our top story on news 10,</i>

429
00:25:03,697 --> 00:25:05,780
<i>the search</i>
<i>for the missing honor student.</i>

430
00:25:05,782 --> 00:25:07,765
<i>The victim in this case</i>

431
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:10,718
<i>reportedly insisted</i>
<i>he'd been chosen by birthright,</i>

432
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,488
causing speculation that a cult
<i>may be behind the abduction.</i>

433
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,707
The family car is also missing.

434
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:17,559
<i>Federal authorities</i>
<i>have been placed on alert.</i>

435
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:20,111
<i>Again, 16-year-old</i>
<i>honor student Kevin Tran</i>

436
00:25:20,113 --> 00:25:24,299
<i>reportedly taken from his</i>
<i>Michigan home early yesterday.</i>

437
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:35,343
Oh, crap.

438
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:40,765
Hey.

439
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:42,150
So,
we got another wrinkle.

440
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:43,968
Uh, looks like
Kevin's gone missing...

441
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,270
And it's gone federal.

442
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:46,571
Yeah.

443
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:48,273
Where's Meg?

444
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:49,440
I'm here.

445
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:51,826
Great,
so now we're kidnappers?

446
00:25:51,828 --> 00:25:53,528
Not if we shut up about it.

447
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,146
Why? Who'd we kidnap?

448
00:26:05,157 --> 00:26:06,674
Oh, God.

449
00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:07,658
What?

450
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,377
Nothing. Nothing.

451
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:11,379
Just...

452
00:26:11,381 --> 00:26:12,931
my life...

453
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,465
my future...

454
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:17,719
...my girlfriend...

455
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:19,687
My mom's car.
Yeah.

456
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:21,022
Yeah, Castiel. It's me.

457
00:26:21,024 --> 00:26:22,574
Cass?
Where? Where is he?

458
00:26:22,576 --> 00:26:24,692
Shut up.
No. No, Cass.

459
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:26,060
You talk.

460
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:27,028
Perth?

461
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,863
"Perth"? As in Australia?

462
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:29,898
What dogs?

463
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,201
He says he's surrounded
by unhappy dogs.

464
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:35,686
Oh. Okay.

465
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:37,521
He's at a dog track
in Perth.

466
00:26:38,908 --> 00:26:41,626
Yeah, they're unhappy
'cause the rabbit's fake.

467
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:45,713
Listen, we're on highway 94,
north of St. Cloud, Minnesota,

468
00:26:45,715 --> 00:26:48,416
just passing
mile marker 79.

469
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:53,371
Aah!

470
00:26:55,841 --> 00:26:58,059
Kevin, this is Castiel.

471
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:01,930
You're one of the angels?

472
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:07,268
Boop.

473
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:10,104
Meg, are you hurt?

474
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:11,406
Shut up.

475
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:13,408
Guys, what happened back there?
Who were those guys?

476
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,244
They're from the Garrison --
my old Garrison.

477
00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:18,780
Looks like
Hester's taken over.

478
00:27:18,782 --> 00:27:21,532
We were assigned
to watch the earth.

479
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:23,001
Often, it was boring.

480
00:27:23,003 --> 00:27:26,004
The wars were very boring
and the sex --

481
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:27,755
you know, the repetition.

482
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:29,740
Anyway, I was, uh...

483
00:27:29,742 --> 00:27:31,509
I was their Captain.

484
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:33,177
Isn't that strange?

485
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:35,129
Cass, why are they pissed
at us now?

486
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,799
You know, those racing dogs
were absolutely miserable.

487
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:39,434
They can only think
in ovals.

488
00:27:39,436 --> 00:27:41,419
Cass, don't make me
pull this car over!

489
00:27:41,421 --> 00:27:42,470
Why are angels after us?

490
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:44,522
Are you angry?
Why are you angry?

491
00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:46,024
No, I-I'm...

492
00:27:46,026 --> 00:27:48,609
Please,
can we just stay on target?

493
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:52,480
There is no reason for anger.
They're only following protocol.

494
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:54,615
If the word of God
is revealed,

495
00:27:54,617 --> 00:27:56,934
a keeper of the word
will awaken,

496
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:59,037
like this hot potato
right here.

497
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,155
Please stop that.

498
00:28:01,157 --> 00:28:02,540
Anyway,

499
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:05,493
Garrison code dictates you
take the keeper to the desert

500
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:07,378
to learn the word
away from men.

501
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,313
What kind of sense
does that make?

502
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:11,299
He has to tell us
so that we can use it.

503
00:28:11,301 --> 00:28:14,002
That's God
and his shiny red apples.

504
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:16,954
I can't live in the desert.
I-I'm applying to Princeton!

505
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:19,424
Okay, you know what?
Screw the Garrison.

506
00:28:19,426 --> 00:28:23,011
We need the tablet to end
Sick Roman's "soylent us" crap.

507
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:24,295
If you want the word,

508
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:26,981
you'll have to duck Hester
and her soldiers.

509
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:29,100
Yeah, you're in our corner,
right, Cass?

510
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:31,652
No,
I don't fight anymore.

511
00:28:31,654 --> 00:28:35,406
I watch the bees.

512
00:28:42,898 --> 00:28:46,284
Let's leave off angel-proofing
sigils or I'll be expelled, too.

513
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:48,336
As long as we're invisible
to your Garrison buddies,

514
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:49,537
it works for me.

515
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:52,490
I'm sure you're pretty hungry,

516
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:54,375
so once we get settled
in upstairs,

517
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:55,960
we'll get some dinner going.

518
00:28:59,932 --> 00:29:02,800
This looks like
a sex-torture dungeon.

519
00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:06,888
Is this
a sex-torture dungeon?

520
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,141
No,
this is not a sex-torture...

521
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:14,345
Get over here.
Sit down and read, would you?

522
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:22,686
You seem troubled.

523
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:25,907
Of course, that's a primary
aspect of your personality,

524
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:27,875
so I sometimes ignore it.

525
00:29:29,294 --> 00:29:31,245
Okay. Um...

526
00:29:33,832 --> 00:29:35,800
...right now I'm just
wondering about you.

527
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:38,252
What about me?

528
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:43,775
You're worried about
the burden I lifted from you.

529
00:29:43,777 --> 00:29:46,344
I think I was done for.

530
00:29:48,697 --> 00:29:50,898
Do you see Lucifer?

531
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:54,552
I did at first.

532
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:55,970
It was...

533
00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:59,640
It was a projection of yours,
I think, sort of an aftertaste.

534
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:06,581
Now I more see...
well, everything.

535
00:30:08,784 --> 00:30:13,271
It's funny. I was --
I was done for, too.

536
00:30:13,273 --> 00:30:17,091
The weight
of all my mistakes,

537
00:30:17,093 --> 00:30:19,744
all those lives
and souls lost, I...

538
00:30:19,746 --> 00:30:21,963
I couldn't take it,
either.

539
00:30:21,965 --> 00:30:24,365
I was

540
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:30,671
I was lost
until I took on your pain.

541
00:30:30,673 --> 00:30:33,991
It's strange to think that
that helped, but --

542
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:36,927
I know you never did anything
but try to help.

543
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:39,530
I realize that, Cass,
and I'm grateful.

544
00:30:39,532 --> 00:30:40,898
We're all grateful.

545
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,901
And we're gonna help you
get better, okay?

546
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:45,436
No matter what it takes.

547
00:30:45,438 --> 00:30:48,456
What do you mean,
"better"?

548
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:10,428
Kevin.

549
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,997
This is all too much.

550
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:15,833
What's happened
to my life?

551
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:17,301
I'm just a kid
from Michigan.

552
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:19,020
I didn't want to be
a word keeper!

553
00:31:20,523 --> 00:31:23,407
Looks like
we're brown-baggin' it.

554
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:30,581
I am not prepared to factor the
supernatural into my world view.

555
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:32,483
Okay, there we go.

556
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:35,286
That's it. That's it.
Just breathe. Take it easy.

557
00:31:44,097 --> 00:31:46,330
I don't know, man.
What can I say?

558
00:31:46,332 --> 00:31:49,383
You've been chosen.

559
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:55,389
And it sucks.
Believe me.

560
00:31:57,342 --> 00:31:59,343
There's no use
asking "why me?"

561
00:31:59,345 --> 00:32:03,264
'Cause the angels --
they don't care.

562
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,986
I think maybe they just don't
have the equipment to care.

563
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:16,994
Seems like when they try,
it just...

564
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:20,464
...breaks them apart.

565
00:32:23,802 --> 00:32:25,136
I just want to be

566
00:32:25,138 --> 00:32:29,223
the first Asian-American
President of the United States.

567
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:34,929
Then do your homework.

568
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:02,106
See? I'm here,
just like I said.

569
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:04,058
You'd better start talking,
skank.

570
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,093
Tell me again why
I'm not just hauling you off

571
00:33:06,095 --> 00:33:07,244
to the king's cash window.

572
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:08,879
Come on, Rosco.

573
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:10,931
I told you.
I've got something way better.

574
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:13,284
You know how Crowley
likes presents.

575
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:15,303
He's not gonna care
if we bring in the Winchesters.

576
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:16,637
Yesterday's news.

577
00:33:18,273 --> 00:33:19,774
Not the Winchesters.

578
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:22,994
I've got the angel
who double-crossed him.

579
00:33:22,996 --> 00:33:25,262
I've got Castiel.

580
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,867
Nah.

581
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,819
Castiel -- he's dead.

582
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:35,623
Right,
'cause you're in that loop.

583
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:37,992
Where is he, then?

584
00:33:37,994 --> 00:33:42,079
First, I want to know how many
of you jerks I have to cut in.

585
00:33:43,383 --> 00:33:45,115
You think we're stupid?

586
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:46,884
We didn't tell anybody.

587
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:49,337
I love demons.

588
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:30,961
Didn't expect
to see you back.

589
00:34:30,963 --> 00:34:33,798
Yeah, not without
the King's army.

590
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,132
Knife.

591
00:34:36,134 --> 00:34:37,768
Typical.

592
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,603
I save our bacon,

593
00:34:39,605 --> 00:34:42,139
and you're sitting here,
waiting by a devil's trap.

594
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:45,893
Seriously, I just killed
two of Crowley's men.

595
00:34:45,895 --> 00:34:48,279
I could have gone
the other way on that.

596
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:49,897
It's true, incidentally.

597
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:53,067
There's other demons' blood
on that blade.

598
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:57,838
Look, I'm simpler
than you think.

599
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,458
I've figured one thing out
about this world --

600
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,209
just one, pretty much.

601
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:03,961
You find a cause,
and you serve it.

602
00:35:03,963 --> 00:35:06,180
Give yourself over,
and it orders your life.

603
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:10,384
Lucifer and Yellow Eyes --
their mission was it for me.

604
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:11,869
So, what?

605
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:13,804
We should trust you because you
wanted to free Satan from hell?

606
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:16,073
I'm talking "cause,"
douche bag,

607
00:35:16,075 --> 00:35:18,058
as in reason to get up
in the morning.

608
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,928
Obviously, these things
shift over time.

609
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,763
We learn, we grow.

610
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:27,435
Now, for me currently, the cause
is bringing down the King.

611
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:29,553
And I know we'll need help
to do it.

612
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:31,388
Crowley ain't the problem
this year.

613
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,741
When are you gonna get it?
Crowley's always the problem.

614
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:35,910
He's just waiting
for the right moment to strike.

615
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:38,028
I know what I'm supposed to do.

616
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,731
And it isn't
screw with Sam and Dean

617
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:44,234
or lose the only angel
who'd go to bat for me.

618
00:35:57,048 --> 00:35:58,916
This is good --

619
00:35:58,918 --> 00:36:00,601
harmony, communication.

620
00:36:00,603 --> 00:36:03,020
Now our only problem
is Hester.

621
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:04,305
What?

622
00:36:04,307 --> 00:36:06,357
Well, here, we're hidden
from the Garrison,

623
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:10,728
but when you killed a demon, you
put out a pretty clear beacon.

624
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,932
We need
better angel-proofing <i>now.</i>

625
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:20,404
You took the Prophet
from us?!

626
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:23,290
I'm -- I'm sorry?

627
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:26,210
You have fallen
in every way imaginable.

628
00:36:26,212 --> 00:36:27,962
Please, Castiel.

629
00:36:27,964 --> 00:36:30,447
We have to follow the code.
Help us do our work.

630
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:32,383
He can't help you.
He can't help anybody.

631
00:36:32,385 --> 00:36:33,534
We don't need his help...

632
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:35,252
or his permission.

633
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:40,641
The Keeper goes to the desert
tonight.

634
00:36:41,726 --> 00:36:43,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back off.

635
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:46,096
We're actually trying to clean
up one of your Angel's messes!

636
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:47,114
You know that.

637
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:48,432
He's right.

638
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:51,468
An angel brought the Leviathan
back into this world,

639
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,821
and -- and they begged him.

640
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:55,539
They begged him not to do it.

641
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,140
Look, just give us
some time, okay?

642
00:36:57,142 --> 00:36:59,810
We will take care
of your Prophet.

643
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:03,564
Why should <i>we</i>
give <i>you</i> anything...

644
00:37:03,566 --> 00:37:06,600
After everything
you have taken from us?

645
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:08,986
The very touch of you
corrupts.

646
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:12,840
When Castiel first laid a hand
on you in hell, he was lost!

647
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:17,761
For that,
you're going to pay.

648
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:19,179
Please.

649
00:37:19,181 --> 00:37:22,666
They're the ones we were
put here to protect.

650
00:37:23,602 --> 00:37:26,554
No, Castiel.

651
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:32,443
No more madness!

652
00:37:32,445 --> 00:37:33,694
No more promises!

653
00:37:33,696 --> 00:37:35,396
No more new Gods!

654
00:37:40,452 --> 00:37:41,702
Hester! No!

655
00:37:41,704 --> 00:37:43,203
Please!

656
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:45,072
There's so few of us left.

657
00:37:48,628 --> 00:37:50,694
You wanted free will.

658
00:37:51,362 --> 00:37:53,881
Now <i>I'm</i> making the choices.

659
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:10,981
What?

660
00:38:10,983 --> 00:38:12,800
Someone had to.

661
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,214
These are strange times.

662
00:38:23,828 --> 00:38:27,530
I think
they've always been.

663
00:38:27,532 --> 00:38:30,137
I wish
you'd come with us.

664
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:33,974
Oh, I'm not part
of the Garrison anymore, Inias.

665
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:35,926
I'm sorry.

666
00:38:45,804 --> 00:38:47,671
Thanks, Kevin.

667
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,890
Not a lot of people
could handle this.

668
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:53,443
You doing all right there,
"chosen one"?

669
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:54,678
Yeah.

670
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,030
Are you ready, Kevin Tran?

671
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:06,239
Bring the Keeper to his home.
We can watch over him there.

672
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,765
I couldn't find Meg
anywhere.

673
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:18,418
Yes, well,
she enjoys laying low.

674
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:22,689
Here.

675
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:25,125
Leviathan cannot be slain

676
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:26,576
but by a bone
of a righteous mortal

677
00:39:26,578 --> 00:39:29,146
washed in the three bloods
of the fallen.

678
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:32,282
Uh...

679
00:39:32,284 --> 00:39:36,987
It says we need to start with
the blood of a fallen angel.

680
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:43,577
Well, you know me.

681
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:46,746
I'm always happy to bleed
for the Winchesters.

682
00:39:53,387 --> 00:39:56,673
What are you gonna do,
Cass?

683
00:39:56,675 --> 00:39:59,342
I don't know.

684
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:02,679
Isn't that amazing?

685
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:10,821
Well, let's get to work.

686
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:14,825
We're going everything
we can.

687
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:15,942
Mrs. Tran, believe me.

688
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:18,111
He said
he'd had a s-seizure.

689
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,313
What -- what if
they hit him?

690
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:22,482
What if he has
a brain injury?

691
00:40:22,484 --> 00:40:23,984
You need to trust us,
okay?

692
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:26,486
It won't help to
wear yourself out with worry.

693
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:29,422
Mom?

694
00:40:29,424 --> 00:40:30,540
Kevin!

695
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:32,659
Oh!

696
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:39,382
Who are you?

697
00:40:39,384 --> 00:40:41,501
It's -- it's okay, Mom.
They brought me back.

698
00:40:41,503 --> 00:40:43,637
They're keeping me safe.

699
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,672
I don't believe
that's true.

700
00:40:46,173 --> 00:40:48,358
Rock beats scissor.

701
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:54,531
Leviathan beats Angel.

702
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:07,994
Hello, Kevin.
