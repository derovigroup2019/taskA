1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,375
Those things from purgatory.
Uh...Leviathan.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,600
They're like
shapeshifters only a lot

3
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:08,218
only a lot more
into eating folk.

4
00:00:08,286 --> 00:00:10,420
And they bleed black goo.

5
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:12,289
Mr. Singer. I believe
you know Sheriff Mills.

6
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:17,394
It's Dick frigging Roman.

7
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,762
Who the hell
is Dick frigging Roman?

8
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:21,298
I'm gonna eat you, Bob.
Yes.

9
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:24,902
Bobby! Come on!

10
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:26,019
Come on! Come on!

11
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:28,772
Go! Go!

12
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:30,824
Hey, Bobby, your hat.

13
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:33,560
Oh, God. Bobby?!
Hold on!

14
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:35,996
What, did you come here
to finish the job?

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,247
We're coming for you,

16
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:39,166
and not just to hurt you --
to kill you.

17
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,986
Bobby, um, hey.

18
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:44,087
Thanks...for everything.

19
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:45,655
Idjits.

20
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:49,376
Bobby? Hey!

21
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:03,640
All right, let's do this.
Move fast.

22
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:05,342
Wait, wait, wait.
What's the plan exactly?

23
00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:07,844
Don't die.

24
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,025
He's heading downtown.

25
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:23,577
All right, you take the street.
I'll take the alley.

26
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:25,228
I'll meet you
in the middle.

27
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:35,405
Son of a...

28
00:01:41,763 --> 00:01:43,096
Dean?

29
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,190
Dean?!

30
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:57,241

32
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:25,222
Don't give me
that dirty-diaper look.

33
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:26,273
I ain't calling you.

34
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:32,612
Hello?

35
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:34,648
Sam, it's Jody Mills.
I wake you?

36
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:36,366
The sheriff?

37
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:38,201
Uh, yeah.
Uh, I mean, uh --

38
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:40,570
Listen, I got something that
smells like you boys.

39
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:42,539
A body turned up
in Canton, Ohio.

40
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:45,158
Local P.D.'s trying to bury
the story and the body.

41
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:47,828
Okay, um, so, uh,
what's up with the body?

42
00:02:47,912 --> 00:02:49,429
Well, when it went missing,

43
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:52,549
it was a perfectly normal grad
student named Charles Durbin.

44
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:53,884
When it turned up,

45
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:56,103
the thing was mummified
minus the wrapping.

46
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,305
This is actually
the second body found like this

47
00:02:58,389 --> 00:02:59,573
in the last couple weeks.

48
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,341
Sound like a song
you boys tap to?

49
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,060
Yeah, yeah,
that's, that's um...

50
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:04,194
that's
our kind of number.

51
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:05,462
Hey, question --

52
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:07,531
how does a sheriff
in Sioux Falls

53
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:09,599
get wind of a case in Ohio?

54
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,184
I'm just that nosy.

55
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,071
Look, after everything I've been
through with you boys and...

56
00:03:14,138 --> 00:03:17,290
with Bobby, you know,

57
00:03:17,358 --> 00:03:19,476
something like this pops up
on the wire, it catches my ear.

58
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:20,810
What can I say?

59
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:21,778
Well, we'll look into it.
Thanks, Sheriff.

60
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,680
- Call me after, okay?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,318
That was Sheriff Mills.
She caught us one.

62
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:30,554
Oh, I feel bad.
We didn't get her anything.

63
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:32,456
I can't believe
I'm about to say this

64
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:35,108
but I hope you're watching
cartoon smut,

65
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:38,028
'cause reading Dick Roman crap
over and over again

66
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:40,931
is just self-punishment.

67
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,555
It's called anime,
and it's an art form.

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,116
Well, this looks nice.

69
00:03:59,183 --> 00:04:01,017
Check around back?

70
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:13,413
And one un-rancid bedroom.

71
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:14,815
Define semi-functioning,

72
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:17,868
and do not use the words
"hole in the floor."

73
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:37,720
How does paper
beat a rock?

74
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:40,557
It's stupid.

75
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:48,748
Kids playing hide-and-seek
found the body.

76
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:50,083
Wow. Very King Tut.

77
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:52,335
Yeah, so, this is where
the eyewitness

78
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:53,670
to the assault lives,

79
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:56,339
but the cops are calling him
an unreliable witness.

80
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:57,457
Because?

81
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:59,259
Let's find out.

82
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:02,045
Special Agent Smith.

83
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:04,598
This is, uh,
Special Agent Smith.

84
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:05,966
No relation.

85
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,750
Whoa.

86
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:09,302
Do you mind if we,
uh...

87
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:12,422
My mom's sleeping in there.

88
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:17,227
S-so, how can I...?

89
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:19,229
Oh, we, uh -- we had a few
questions about the incident

90
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,763
you witnessed in the alley.

91
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:24,034
You just gonna laugh at my story
like the rest of the suits?

92
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,051
We're not gonna
laugh at you.

93
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:32,075
All right, well,
I'm on the steps...

94
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:35,629
medicating...
when I hear fighting.

95
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:37,497
So I look.

96
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:39,583
There's my neighbor Durbin,

97
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:41,551
and some dude
dressed like my grandpa's

98
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:44,221
got him by the neck,
right?

99
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:45,639
What do you he looks like
your grandpa?

100
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:50,227
Uh...
Snappy shoes, suit,

101
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:53,129
one of those, um,
Justin Timberlake hats.

102
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,198
Y-you mean a --
a fedora?

103
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,466
Aha!

104
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:57,634
Did you see anything else?

105
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:04,774
This red, like, energy

106
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:09,729
passed through Durbin
to hat guy.

107
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:12,499
Even my watch stopped.

108
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,334
Durbs...

109
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:18,821
He aged before my eyes.

110
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:22,375
He looked like a raisin.

111
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:25,211
Well, we believe you.

112
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:27,380
Oh.

113
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:28,848
Thanks for your help.

114
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:30,833
Thank you,
officer -- officers.

115
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,232
Yep. Nothing that turns a dude
into a crypt keeper.

116
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,850
You?

117
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:51,454
Uh, well, greater Canton
turns out kind of a hot spot

118
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:53,290
for weird dead bodies.

119
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:55,024
Hmm. You don't say.

120
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:56,660
Yeah. News archives.

121
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:59,546
They're not exactly reporting,
uh, mummifies.

122
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,715
But still -- 1928,

123
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:05,051
three deaths cited as
spontaneous combustion.

124
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:07,420
Bodies "shriveled despite
no signs of fire."

125
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:09,372
Little stretch, but okay.

126
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:11,708
'74, three bodies found
with leathery decay.

127
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,729
Uh, '57, three more --
severe dehydration.

128
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,897
This time one made
the front page.

129
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:21,685
Girl named Terry Cervantes
found a corpse near her church.

130
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:23,236
Any pattern here
other than the location?

131
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:24,821
Random vics,
random years.

132
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:26,556
But they seem to drop
in threes.

133
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:30,026
That's two down,
one to go.

134
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:31,494
All right,
let me drive for a sec.

135
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:33,947
What, are you gonna look up
more anime,

136
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:35,999
or are you
strictly into Dick now?

137
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:46,209
Hmm.

138
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,545
- Are those local feeds?
- Yeah.

139
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:50,263
How did you do that
so fast?

140
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:52,915
A little tutorial
from Frank.

141
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:57,971
Don't worry. We'll pretend
this never happened.

142
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:03,259
Now, mummy numero dos
was found at the Gas n' Sip

143
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,761
near Main Street, correct?

144
00:08:04,812 --> 00:08:06,196
Yeah.

145
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:09,816
All right, well, here's all
the cameras around that store.

146
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:13,620
You need to teach me
that trick.

147
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:17,273
Hey, check it out --
Timberlake.

148
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:22,212
Wait a sec.

149
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,497
You can't let me bask in the
glory for one second, can you?

150
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:25,615
Shut up.

151
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,384
Look.

152
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:34,140
He hasn't aged a day,
has he?

153
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:37,460
All right, well, if he's been
popping up for decades now,

154
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:39,679
then somebody's bound to know
who he is, right?

155
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:42,899
Is there any chance that, uh,
Terry's still local?

156
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:45,802
You know it's so pretty
in the spring.

157
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:47,854
Everything's blooming.

158
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:49,639
That's why I walked home
that way --

159
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,341
to see the flowers.

160
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,077
Instead, I found that body.

161
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:57,230
I still have no idea what could
have done that to a person.

162
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:59,816
Do you recognize
that man?

163
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,918
Yeah.

164
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:04,871
I mean, he lived
on my parents' street.

165
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:06,489
Mr. Snider.

166
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,760
Where'd you say
your parents live?

167
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:18,435
So, what exactly
is this thing?

168
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:21,170
Some sort of vampire
who got too sucky?

169
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:22,522
Nope.

170
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,674
Coroner's reports said
there was blood in both bodies.

171
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:27,243
300-year-old blood,
but blood.

172
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:41,023
Dude, dude.
Uh, fedora dude.

173
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:47,046
All right,
let's do this.

174
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:48,381
Let's move fast.

175
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:49,582
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's the plan here, exactly?

176
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,751
Don't die.

177
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:09,552
All right, you take the street.
I'll take the alley.

178
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:11,187
I'll meet you
in the middle.

179
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:22,882
Son of a...

180
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:38,097
Hey!

181
00:10:38,182 --> 00:10:39,716
Hey!

182
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:42,185
Hey!

183
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:52,562
Hey, you!

184
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:55,448
Drop the gun!

185
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:56,950
Put it down!
Drop the gun!

186
00:10:57,034 --> 00:11:00,269
All right.

187
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,141
- Okay, can I just --
- Don't.

188
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:23,894
Listen to me.

189
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:26,080
Hey, if you tell me you're from
the Bureau one more time,

190
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:27,998
I'm gonna
air you out myself.

191
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:29,033
Got it?

192
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:39,043
"No signal."

193
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,228
Are you some
kind of Jerry spy?

194
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:42,463
Jerry who?

195
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,482
And a terrible one at that.

196
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,803
This badge was issued
68 years from now.

197
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:52,723
Ace work,
kraut-muncher.

198
00:11:56,361 --> 00:11:58,929
'44?

199
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,814
I'm stuck in 1944?!

200
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,935
We're all stuck in 1944,
ya bunny.

201
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,551
Take a powder.

202
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:22,753
Yes, sir.

203
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:28,425
Look I don't even like
frigging Sauerkraut, okay,

204
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:29,810
so you can
just skip the --

205
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:32,062
What happened in the alley?
And paint me a real picture.

206
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,430
All right, well,

207
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:37,101
I'm "12 monkey'ed" no matter
what I say, so here goes.

208
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:42,489
I was chasing this dude. Uh,
I'd just seen him mummify a guy.

209
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:45,109
Yeah.
So, I jumped him.

210
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,196
He lights up red.
Poof, we're in 1944.

211
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,125
Tell me more
about the red light.

212
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,321
Are you
seriously asking --

213
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:04,422
You want out of this jail,

214
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,024
you're gonna tell me
everything you can

215
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:09,727
about that man
and the so-called light.

216
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:12,680
Okay.

217
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:16,134
I saw it,
and then we were here.

218
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:23,658
Would you say that, uh...
It was all around you

219
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:26,644
or that more that it came
from inside this fella?

220
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,664
You believe me.

221
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:31,632
Are you...?

222
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:36,037
You're a hunter.

223
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:39,924
I don't know
what you're talking about.

224
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:42,043
Demons,
ghosts, shifters.

225
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:44,779
Hey,
I've killed 'em all.

226
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:47,382
And you're the same.

227
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:50,985
Just 68 years
before me, huh?

228
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:57,281
And your name is...?

229
00:13:57,332 --> 00:14:00,084
Dean...Winchester.

230
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:03,120
Ness.

231
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:04,589
Eliot Ness.

232
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:24,825
Dean?

233
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:26,027
No. Why?
Where's Dean?

234
00:14:26,094 --> 00:14:27,695
The thing that's been
mummifying people

235
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,665
took him in a frigging ball
of light and disappeared.

236
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:32,149
You guys get that a lot?

237
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,951
Yeah,
more than most people.

238
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:35,870
Well, I got you
into this, so --

239
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:37,455
No, no, no, you didn't.
A-all you did was just --

240
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:38,489
Shut up, Sam.

241
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,257
How I can help?

242
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:43,678
Well, um...

243
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:45,713
How do you feel about driving
and lifting boxes?

244
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,805
I-I got to tell you,
I mean, "Untouchables" is, like,

245
00:14:54,856 --> 00:14:56,390
one of my most
favorite movies ever.

246
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:56,991
What?

247
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:58,341
I must have seen that thing,
like, 50 times.

248
00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:01,062
"Seen it?"
What, like, I'm in the --

249
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:02,480
Oh, yeah, yeah! You don't even know!
Oh, you are -- pbht!

250
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:05,232
Look, hey, wait, wait, wait.
Let's just...Slow it down.

251
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:07,068
Okay?

252
00:15:07,152 --> 00:15:09,654
Now, time travel.

253
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:11,372
Is that something you find
up a lot of sleeves

254
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:12,690
in the future or...?

255
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:15,993
No, no, no. It's, uh,
not normally on the menu.

256
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:17,211
Trust me.

257
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:19,029
I'm as surprised as you are
that I'm here.

258
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:20,698
So we're hunting
the same thing,

259
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:23,017
just in different
centuries?

260
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:28,889
Two bodies.

261
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:32,810
A few days apart
just a little over a month ago.

262
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:35,646
One witness said that she saw
an assailant light up red

263
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:37,598
after sucking the life
out of a man.

264
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:39,200
Awesome.

265
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:41,552
How does that
fill you with awe?

266
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:46,657
Look, Dean, this thing,
it kills --

267
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:48,409
- In threes.
- In threes.

268
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,194
But you already know that.

269
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:51,912
He's two down.

270
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:00,287
You're coming with me.

271
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:02,123
We've got to get this thing
before it grabs the last one.

272
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:04,258
Okay, so, so, wait, uh...

273
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:08,295
Does...Does this mean
that I'm an Untouchable now?

274
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,097
It means we got to get you
into some new clothes.

275
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:13,684
You look like
some kind of bindle stiff.

276
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:19,140
Stiff your
br-- bin-- what?

277
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:37,825
Hey.

278
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,293
What's the rumpus,
Eliot?

279
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:43,781
Ezra Moore.
Dean Winchester.

280
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,218
Hey.

281
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:48,952
Who's he?
Some farmer clown?

282
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:51,455
He's, uh,
from the future.

283
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:53,841
Yeah.
Gas costs four bucks.

284
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:56,143
You can get cheese
out of a spray can.

285
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:59,263
And...the President,
he's a black guy.

286
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:00,848
I could go on.

287
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,800
Paint me impressed.

288
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:06,570
I assume you need
some clothes.

289
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:07,971
Come on.

290
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:10,574
Hey, let me, uh --
let me help you with those.

291
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:11,642
No, I got these.

292
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:13,744
You go get the other 20
in my truck.

293
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:14,695
Seriously?

294
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,996
Yeah.

295
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:18,199
I think Bobby may have had
a slight hoarding issue.

296
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:21,418
I could barely get the door open
on that storage locker.

297
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:23,537
And, um, I'm pretty sure
something's alive

298
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:24,755
in at least three
of those boxes.

299
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:53,851
Awesome.

300
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:56,370
"Awesome"?
You some religious kook?

301
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:59,456
No, he just
likes saying that.

302
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:01,492
So, spill already.

303
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:06,547
What bucket of syrup
did you two idjits step into?

304
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:09,717
Something funny,
sweetheart?

305
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:10,885
No, you, uh...

306
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:12,753
You just kind of
remind me of someone.

307
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:15,389
Okay, Ezra...
We need your help.

308
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:17,308
It seems we're hunting
a time traveler.

309
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,592
Delightful.

310
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:25,382
Got it.

311
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:29,720
Looks like fedora man,
1968.

312
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:31,438
Is that a -- is that
a ring on his finger?

313
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:32,823
Um...

314
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:38,028
Yeah.

315
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:48,789
I know that symbol.

316
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:52,710
It's the infinite hourglass.

317
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:55,179
That's the symbol
I saw on his ring.

318
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:57,631
- Yeah, that's the mark of Chronos.
- Who?

319
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:59,049
The God of time.

320
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,584
That's crazy.

321
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:02,386
The thing is,
with the Old Gods,

322
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:04,438
once upon a time they were
just short of invincible.

323
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:06,023
But a lot of their mojo
from worshippers,

324
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,024
from people feeding them.

325
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:08,893
These days, not so much.

326
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:10,260
Right, they're not
what they used to be.

327
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:11,562
But they make up
for lack of power

328
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:14,949
with being twice as pissed
and a lot more hands-on.

329
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,266
Okay.

330
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:18,435
So why's this God
killing people?

331
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:20,604
Could be he's killing folks
for his time juice.

332
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:21,789
All right, well,
how the hell

333
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:23,457
am I gonna
ride him back to 2012?

334
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,376
Well, you could
let him grab you,

335
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:27,995
if you don't mind him
using you for gasoline.

336
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,296
So, how do we
get Dean back?

337
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:30,748
How do we even find
this Chronos?

338
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,301
Best stab?

339
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,837
We find a way
to summon a God.

340
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:38,622
Look, let's just stick with
what we know.

341
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:41,008
Ezra, see if you can
find something in all this junk

342
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:42,559
that will kill a God.

343
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:44,261
No trouble at all.

344
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:47,564
Come in a few hours,
see what I can scrounge up.

345
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:49,466
You said you fellas
found his house?

346
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:52,770
Well, let's go see
if it's been built yet.

347
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:56,407
And then let's kill
that bastard, because that --

348
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:59,243
Is the Chicago way.

349
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:04,081
"The Chicago way?"

350
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:06,000
Who talks like that?

351
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:09,586
Sean Connery.

352
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:12,423
Come on.

353
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:17,261
Never watch that movie again.

354
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,829
- It looks empty.
- You got a lock pick?

355
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:27,054
Sure.

356
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,039
Take a look around.

357
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:48,459
Where's he getting all
the lettuce to support this?

358
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:09,897
He's using
the "biff strategy."

359
00:21:09,981 --> 00:21:11,348
Using what?

360
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:14,018
He's -- Chronos is betting
on races

361
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:15,486
he already knows
the outcome of.

362
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:18,072
Look at this.

363
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:20,223
He's spent a lot
of time in '44.

364
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:22,559
Yeah.

365
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,610
What's L.Y.?

366
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:27,781
It's not a what. It's a who.
Lester young.

367
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:30,284
He lays bets for a lot of
the flunkies in town.

368
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:32,569
Let's say we go
pay him a visit.

369
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,922
Hey! W-whoa!

370
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:37,374
Hey! Hey!
Easy with the jacket!

371
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,378
Yeah, I ain't talking.

372
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:43,964
I'm no stoolie.

373
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:51,588
I learned it
from watching you.

374
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:03,317
Look, you seem like
a swell guy, Lester.

375
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:06,003
And I want to help you out.
I do, but my partner here?

376
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:07,488
He just back from the war.

377
00:22:07,572 --> 00:22:09,306
And he's spent the last
two years

378
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:10,941
kicking in Nazi skulls.

379
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:12,826
If he doesn't kick in
a skull every couple days,

380
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:15,479
he gets real touchy.

381
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:19,716
Lester.
That a German name?

382
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:20,884
Hey, okay, okay.

383
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:21,969
There's no need
to snap your cap.

384
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:23,821
W-who you looking for?

385
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:25,355
Fella by the name
of Snider.

386
00:22:25,423 --> 00:22:27,091
What, that guy?

387
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:28,792
I mean,
bum never missed a bet,

388
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:30,344
but he gave me
the heebie-jeebies,

389
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:31,562
so I cut him off.

390
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:32,646
Where would you meet him
for the payoff?

391
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,801
T-the Early Bird!
It's a dive on Haggerty.

392
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:39,903
Practically lives in the joint.

393
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:56,620
That's it! Damn it.

394
00:22:56,671 --> 00:22:57,871
Okay, yours sounds better.
You first.

395
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:00,073
It says here that people
could summon Chronos

396
00:23:00,141 --> 00:23:02,459
"to compel him to tell them
their futures."

397
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:04,695
And I've got the spell
to do it right here.

398
00:23:04,762 --> 00:23:06,713
So why the "damn it"?

399
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:10,333
'Cause calling Chronos
isn't the problem.

400
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:14,004
It's making sure we summon him
when Dean is right there...

401
00:23:14,055 --> 00:23:15,889
Literally with his hands
on the guy,

402
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:17,191
so he can surf him back.

403
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:18,859
That's not automatic?

404
00:23:18,943 --> 00:23:21,478
No, it's more like we need to
get the time on their end right

405
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:22,696
to the exact second.

406
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,699
Or we get an angry God
but no big brother?

407
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,885
And he's trapped there
forever.

408
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:44,585
"Fine, you ass.
You win for once. Enjoy. R."

409
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:48,972
Who's "R"?

410
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,159
Rufus, a family friend.

411
00:23:52,337 --> 00:23:53,640
Wonder what they
were betting over?

412
00:23:53,995 --> 00:23:56,713
Well, whatever it was,
Rufus sure was a sore loser.

413
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,400
Yeah.

414
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:04,104
It's weird, huh?

415
00:24:06,724 --> 00:24:09,359
It's like their life's
a big puzzle.

416
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,379
You just keep finding
pieces of it

417
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:14,815
scattered
all over the place.

418
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:18,018
We should drink this.

419
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:25,008
He'd want us to.
Am I wrong?

420
00:24:25,076 --> 00:24:29,496
It'd be rude not to.

421
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:45,279
That's him.

422
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:47,698
Kind of puny for a God.

423
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:55,573
Thought you were, uh --
thought you were Mr. Boy Scout.

424
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,293
Why do you think I went after
Capone in the first place?

425
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:01,228
The guy had the best hooch
in Chicago.

426
00:25:02,664 --> 00:25:05,099
So, now, w-who died in your life
and made you a hunter?

427
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,283
Who died?

428
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:08,519
Nobody died,
you morbid son of a bitch.

429
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:10,437
I started doing this

430
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:12,006
'cause vampires were turning
folks in Cleveland.

431
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:13,307
And you got the bug.

432
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:15,559
That's when
I got the bug.

433
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:22,633
Sometimes you just want to
punch through the red tape

434
00:25:22,684 --> 00:25:25,102
with a silver bullet.

435
00:25:26,888 --> 00:25:30,140
Yeah, hunting sets me free.
Isn't that why you hunt?

436
00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:32,443
I used to do it 'cause
that's what my family did.

437
00:25:32,494 --> 00:25:34,278
Hmm.

438
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:36,580
But they just seem
to keep dying.

439
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,084
To tell you the truth,

440
00:25:40,151 --> 00:25:42,486
I don't know why I'm doing
much of anything anymore.

441
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:47,041
Boo-hoo.
Cry me a river, ya Nancy.

442
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:50,878
Tell me, are all hunters
as soft as you in the future?

443
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:54,381
Everybody loses everybody.
And then one day, boom.

444
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:58,435
Your number's up, but at least
you're making a difference.

445
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:01,772
So enjoy it while it lasts,
kid,

446
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,340
'cause hunting's
the only clarity

447
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:04,675
you're gonna find
in this life.

448
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:10,214
And that makes you
luckier than most.

449
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:18,322
Hello, nurse.

450
00:26:23,812 --> 00:26:25,879
Hey.

451
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:53,724
Sweet merciful awesome.

452
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:38,786
Well, everything's
coming up us, kid.

453
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,154
Talk to me.

454
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:42,606
I am.

455
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:46,160
The owner of the house,
Miss Lila Taylor, age 20,

456
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:47,494
lives alone.

457
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,588
Take the car, head back to Ezra,
see what she's got.

458
00:27:49,589 --> 00:27:50,266
I'm gonna stay here

459
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:51,753
and keep my peepers
on the Sheik and the Sheba.

460
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:09,424
That's it?

461
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:13,295
That is a 1,000-year-old
olive carved by vestal virgins

462
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:16,464
and dipped in the blood of --
you don't want to know.

463
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:19,431
Pulling this together
wasn't easy.

464
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,466
You and Ness both owe me,
smoothie.

465
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:26,604
You can have whatever you want
soon as we gank this thing.

466
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:29,357
Yeah, yeah.
Take your twig, wise guy.

467
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:30,608
Well, now,
how's it work?

468
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,176
Well...

469
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:35,981
You stick this end
in his heart.

470
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:38,616
Miss,
he has you for supper.

471
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:39,784
Make sense?

472
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:43,905
Wait, if I --

473
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,191
if I kill Chronos...
I'm stuck here.

474
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:48,793
You just now realized?

475
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:54,303
Oh, come on.
1944 ain't so bad.

476
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:55,855
Yeah, I could head over
to Europe,

477
00:28:55,922 --> 00:28:57,106
punch Hitler in the neck.

478
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,476
Oh, there's lots of ways
to pass the time, sugar.

479
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,450
That's for luck.

480
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:10,269
'Cause I'm lucky.

481
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,938
Thanks.

482
00:29:26,453 --> 00:29:30,139
"Back to the Future III."

483
00:29:30,223 --> 00:29:32,224
I need to borrow
some paper.

484
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:42,602
Mr. Ness I presume?

485
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:45,804
You know, I stopped by
the police station

486
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,989
to take care of that hunter
who rode me here.

487
00:29:47,074 --> 00:29:48,691
I heard you took him
out of jail.

488
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:50,159
I thought
I might see you again.

489
00:30:05,342 --> 00:30:09,428
Ethan?

490
00:30:09,496 --> 00:30:11,013
There you are.

491
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:13,966
Can't take the trash out
without the trash silly.

492
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:15,551
Sorry, honey.

493
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:18,688
I don't know
where I left my head.

494
00:30:18,772 --> 00:30:20,606
Be right there.

495
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,742
Sweetie, I want you
to pack a bag.

496
00:30:52,743 --> 00:30:55,578
Excuse me?

497
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,580
Well, you're always asking me
where I go.

498
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,949
Come with me tonight.

499
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,418
Is...is everything okay?

500
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,587
Yeah,
everything's perfect.

501
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:05,672
You're perfect.

502
00:31:07,925 --> 00:31:09,125
I just need you
to pack a bag

503
00:31:09,176 --> 00:31:10,844
and I'll explain why
on the way, okay?

504
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:12,212
- But the diner --
- Forget about them!

505
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,884
We'll call them tomorrow,
okay?

506
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:20,470
Just go. Pack.

507
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,367
Jackpot.

508
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:50,466
Can I help you, son?

509
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:54,754
Yes, sir. I am, uh,
Special Agent Costner

510
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,840
with the, uh, Department
of Homeland Termite Invasion.

511
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,591
- Termites?
- Yes, sir.

512
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:01,210
There's been an outbreak
all over this area,

513
00:32:01,262 --> 00:32:03,479
and I just want to do
an inspection,

514
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,048
make sure that the, uh,
perimeter's secure.

515
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,552
Yes. Yes, of course.
Um, you'd better come in.

516
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:10,770
Okay.

517
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,029
Is everything okay
up here?

518
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,747
What?!

519
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:39,465
Oh, yeah -- no!

520
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:40,800
No, no.

521
00:32:40,885 --> 00:32:43,136
Not to worry, because
I'm going to install something

522
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,254
that will protect this house
forever.

523
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,808
Yeah.

524
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:12,332
You are toast.

525
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,834
I'll keep pushing.
You go get some shut-eye.

526
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:16,669
Uh, that's okay.
I can, uh...

527
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:19,339
Do I have to use
my mom voice?

528
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:06,102
All right.
You asked for it.

529
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,053
Young man --

530
00:34:08,355 --> 00:34:12,475
"Sammy, turns out
Snider is Chronos."

531
00:34:12,526 --> 00:34:14,894
Wait, this is from Dean?
How --

532
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:18,731
Just read.
"I rode him to 1944.

533
00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:22,184
"Am working with Eliot Ness --
yes, that one.

534
00:34:23,704 --> 00:34:25,705
"Tracked down Chronos.

535
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:29,375
"He's banging some chick
named Lila Taylor,

536
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,693
"and we got a weapon.

537
00:34:30,744 --> 00:34:33,329
We're going after him.
Take care of yourself, Sam."

538
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,199
Look at the top.
November 5, '44.

539
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:39,702
So, now we know the exact date
Dean had hands on Chronos.

540
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:41,087
All we need
is the exact time.

541
00:34:41,171 --> 00:34:42,472
Which we get how?

542
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,891
Hoping, we ask someone
who was there.

543
00:34:47,594 --> 00:34:49,145
Miss Lila Taylor?

544
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,014
Oh, can you get
"The Sullivan Show"?

545
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:53,483
I want to watch
that Frankie Valli.

546
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,270
Um, actually,
we're with the police.

547
00:34:57,354 --> 00:35:01,774
Oh. Is Michael
in trouble again?

548
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:04,827
I told him not to read
those comic books.

549
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,947
Uh, no, no, no, no.
He's, uh -- he's fine.

550
00:35:08,032 --> 00:35:10,900
We'd wanted to ask you
some questions about this man.

551
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:18,241
Ethan.

552
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:20,209
That's Ethan.

553
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,097
Do you remember the last time
you saw Ethan?

554
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:25,948
Of course.

555
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:31,687
November 1944 --
the night the clocks stopped.

556
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,023
Th-the clocks stopped?

557
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:37,560
11:34.
Every clock in the house.

558
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:43,616
Ma'am, can you tell us anything
else you remember?

559
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,319
Ethan...

560
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:48,488
Said awful things.

561
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:50,940
And then...

562
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:53,493
And then he strangled
that poor man.

563
00:35:53,577 --> 00:35:55,344
What poor man?

564
00:35:55,412 --> 00:35:59,582
Two policemen came
to arrest Ethan.

565
00:36:01,802 --> 00:36:05,888
Ma'am,
was this one of them?

566
00:36:07,558 --> 00:36:11,094
Ethan choked the life
out of that man.

567
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,028
Ness!

568
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:30,780
Ness!

569
00:37:37,814 --> 00:37:39,482
Ethan!

570
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,767
Let's talk.

571
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:57,229
Here, break this.

572
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:04,470
Please don't hurt her.

573
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:05,571
Ethan,
what's happening?

574
00:38:05,638 --> 00:38:07,023
Yeah, Ethan.
What the hell?

575
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:08,807
Lila, I'm sorry,
but, you just --

576
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:10,860
everything I said to you
is true--

577
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,278
Oh, he might have left out
a few details.

578
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:14,280
He tell you he's a monster
who jumps through time?

579
00:38:14,347 --> 00:38:15,314
I'm a God!

580
00:38:15,365 --> 00:38:17,249
Look, I'm not a monster.

581
00:38:17,317 --> 00:38:18,961
Listen.
I'm the opposite.

582
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:20,029
Well, don't forget
to tell her about

583
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,800
all the people you murdered
along the way, boy scout.

584
00:38:21,825 --> 00:38:23,025
What?

585
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,257
It's not like that.
I do it for you, Lila.

586
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:26,926
I don't understand.

587
00:38:43,693 --> 00:38:45,911
Well, he's not as strong
as he used to be.

588
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:47,296
Isn't that right, Ethan?

589
00:38:47,364 --> 00:38:50,449
Now you got to
suck people dry.

590
00:38:50,517 --> 00:38:52,701
Wild guess -- it takes
three kills to juice you up.

591
00:38:52,786 --> 00:38:53,903
Sacrifices.

592
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,687
Three sacrifices,

593
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,873
and I can control
when and where I land.

594
00:38:57,958 --> 00:38:59,375
But once I get there,
it's never for long

595
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:01,043
before I'm tossed
through time again.

596
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:02,194
That's my life, Lila.

597
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:03,695
And all I want
is to get back here.

598
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:06,132
Because you just love
the clean Canton air?

599
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,583
Because I love her!

600
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:10,136
Because I lived the worst
existence you can imagine,

601
00:39:10,203 --> 00:39:11,720
and then I found you.

602
00:39:11,805 --> 00:39:14,873
After you killed Tyler Crosby
and Cathy Porter?

603
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:16,258
Lila here was gonna be
victim number three.

604
00:39:16,343 --> 00:39:17,760
Am I right?

605
00:39:17,844 --> 00:39:19,428
Don't act like you never
killed a soul

606
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:20,729
before you met her, pal.

607
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:22,398
Something tells me you used to
kill three saps

608
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,650
just for
a change of scenery.

609
00:39:24,717 --> 00:39:25,768
Yes, I did.

610
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:27,770
Back down.

611
00:39:27,854 --> 00:39:30,940
I-I used to wander,

612
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:33,392
but now I have you.

613
00:39:33,443 --> 00:39:35,027
I knew Cathy.

614
00:39:35,112 --> 00:39:37,530
She used to come into the diner
every day.

615
00:39:37,581 --> 00:39:38,581
Lila, please.

616
00:39:38,665 --> 00:39:40,399
You are a monster.

617
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,417
No, Lila, please!

618
00:39:49,242 --> 00:39:52,411
<i>O khrone parakaloumen</i>
<i>se thespizein</i>

619
00:39:52,462 --> 00:39:54,346
<i>hemin khronon</i>
<i>ton mellonta.</i>

620
00:40:03,306 --> 00:40:04,590
No!

621
00:40:08,428 --> 00:40:11,096
Hey, Untouchable!

622
00:40:18,321 --> 00:40:19,438
Dean!

623
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:22,491
Hey!

624
00:40:25,445 --> 00:40:28,330
No!

625
00:40:28,415 --> 00:40:29,715
You!
Destroyed everything!

626
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:32,301
Hey, Chronos?!

627
00:40:34,504 --> 00:40:35,954
Was that
the best you got?

628
00:40:48,351 --> 00:40:52,137
You want to know
your future?

629
00:40:52,189 --> 00:40:55,991
I know your future.

630
00:40:56,076 --> 00:41:01,580
It's covered
in thick black ooze.

631
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:06,835
It's everywhere.

632
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,255
They're everywhere.

633
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:15,010
Enjoy oblivion.
