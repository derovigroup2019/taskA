1
00:00:02,696 --> 00:00:04,331
Mr. Singer...

2
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:08,201
...your time's up.

3
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,055
Bobby! Bobby!

4
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:13,773
Idjits.

5
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:17,510
Bobby? Hey!

6
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:19,713
You really want
to get stuck...

7
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:21,214
turning into some ghost?

8
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:22,766
I know what I'm doing,
Rufus.

9
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:24,167
You're thinking
you can help those boys.

10
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:27,487
But how many spirits you meet
in their right mind?

11
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:31,024
What's it gonna be --
stay or go?

12
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:33,693
I'm concerned that Bobby
might be haunting you.

13
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:35,395
I've already tried
contacting Bobby.

14
00:00:35,397 --> 00:00:36,562
Without me?

15
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:38,582
If he was there,
I'd have told you.

16
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:41,451
We burned him, Dean.

17
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:43,837
The blade was across the room,
and then it was in my hand.

18
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:44,871
My beer drank itself.

19
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:46,456
That page magically appeared
on the bed.

20
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,591
Bobby's book fell down,

21
00:00:47,593 --> 00:00:49,459
and out popped the number
of the guy who found Cass.

22
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:50,460
It's <i>not</i> Bobby!

23
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:51,878
It could be.

24
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,046
- No, it <i>couldn't</i> be!
- Why not?

25
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:54,881
Because we <i>want</i> it to be.

26
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:58,268
Regular people -- they see ones
they lost everywhere, too.

27
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,469
Yeah, freakin' ghosts.

28
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:01,087
Or they just
miss them a lot.

29
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:05,058
If it <i>was</i> Bobby,
he would let us know.

30
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:13,316
Balls!

31
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:20,273
All right, here we go.

32
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:25,078
You know...

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,580
even though the world
is going to crap,

34
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:30,450
there's one thing
that I can always count on --

35
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:33,586
these things tasting the same
in every drive-through

36
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:35,972
in every state
in our great nation.

37
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:38,642
Mmm.

38
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:48,301
Annie.

39
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:49,569
Hey, Dean.

40
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:51,655
A nice surprise.
How you been?

41
00:01:51,657 --> 00:01:54,274
Oh, I'm still kicking.
So, good, I guess.

42
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:55,641
Heard about Bobby.

43
00:01:57,828 --> 00:01:59,312
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:02,115
Yeah. Us too.

45
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:04,417
What's up?

46
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:05,618
Well, I got
some of his old books.

47
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,652
I thought
maybe you'd want them.

48
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:07,987
Yeah. Sure.
Where you at?

49
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:09,673
Bodega Bay.
Crow's Nest Inn.

50
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:11,207
- You working?
- Always.

51
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:12,459
You guys anywhere nearby?

52
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:13,677
- Near enough.
- Cool.

53
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:14,678
Why don't we meet

54
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,929
at the Pier Front
Restaurant -- lunch?

55
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:18,598
- 1:00?
- Yeah. Bye.

56
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:35,365
We shouldn't be here.

57
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:38,184
Yeah. I know.

58
00:02:51,532 --> 00:02:53,166
Cops?

59
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:30,420
You shouldn't have
come here.

62
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,114
Hey, get this.

63
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:18,251
Dick Roman is funding
another archaeological dig.

64
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:21,387
Guy moves more dirt
than "The Drudge Report."

65
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:24,507
Well, anything
on what he's digging <i>for?</i>

66
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:28,294
Don't you think
I would have led with that?

67
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,333
Annie's not usually
this late, is she?

68
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:35,685
No, never.

69
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:38,571
She's totally compulsive.
I'll try her cell.

70
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:42,808
You know, uh, you know she
and Bobby had a thing, right?

71
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,644
Yeah.

72
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:46,979
Yeah, I knew that.

73
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,217
Really?

74
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:52,585
Yeah.

75
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:55,821
Kind of a foxhole thing --
very Hemingway.

76
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:58,174
Huh.

77
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:05,348
She and I kind of went Hemingway
this one time, too.

78
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:09,853
All right, well...

79
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:11,855
that happens.

80
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:15,675
What, you too?

81
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:17,176
Look, it was
a  while back.

82
00:05:17,178 --> 00:05:18,528
We ended up
on the same case.

83
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,562
She was stressed.

84
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:21,347
I-I-I...

85
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:24,567
I didn't...have a soul.

86
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,453
That's a lot of foxholes.

87
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,122
She's not answering.

88
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:34,911
Well, here's to ghosts
that aren't there.

89
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,299
You sound
kind of disappointed.

90
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:40,466
Ah, it's better this way.

91
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:42,868
I mean, even though I wish
we could see him again

92
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,254
doesn't mean
that we should.

93
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:49,976
Ahh.

94
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:53,396
Are we being stood up?

95
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:57,483
Yeah, let's hope
that's all this is.

96
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:04,724
Nothing?

97
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:05,891
Straight to voicemail.

98
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,160
Something's not right.

99
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:08,995
What's she doing
on Bodega Bay?

100
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:11,864
She's working some kind of job.
She didn't really say.

101
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:13,116
I got to get a refill.

102
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:14,250
You know what, man?

103
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:16,686
Why don't you just pack it away
for a while?

104
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:19,289
All it does is remind us of him,
you know?

105
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:25,378
Yeah, I thought about that,
but, uh...not yet.

106
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:33,486
Let's go check out
Annie's hotel room.

107
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:37,590
These go back years --
disappearances never solved.

108
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:40,059
They stop
a few decades back,

109
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:42,812
then pick up again
just recently.

110
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:43,929
All teenagers.

111
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:45,381
Looks like
Annie found a spot

112
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:47,000
a lot of them liked
to poke around

113
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:48,568
just before
they went missing.

114
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,652
Yeah?

115
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:52,488
Yeah.
Old Van Ness house.

116
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,524
It's, uh, cheery.

117
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:56,943
Well, the police
combed the place.

118
00:06:56,945 --> 00:06:57,943
They always come up dry.

119
00:06:57,945 --> 00:06:59,445
Yeah, local law.
Always on the ball.

120
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:01,314
Guys...

121
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:03,333
So, built in 1862
by the Van Ness family...

122
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:06,185
I just made that curtain shimmy.
...Who lost it in the early 1900s.

123
00:07:06,187 --> 00:07:08,788
Could you look in the
right place at the right time?

124
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,340
Put up for sale
a few years back. No takers.

125
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,724
Probably 'cause it creeps
their queso.

126
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:14,377
Balls,
this is exhausting.

127
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,346
It's just been sitting there,
boarded up, for ages.

128
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,380
Oh. Get this.

129
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:19,449
I guess
a couple months back,

130
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:20,817
someone put it
on one of those, uh,

131
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,885
"most haunted houses
in America" lists.

132
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:24,754
Let me guess -- that's when the
teenagers started going missing.

133
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:26,072
- Yep.
- Okay.

134
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:26,990
Now let's get rolling.

135
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:28,641
I say we get rolling.

136
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,668
Idjits.

137
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:46,726
Thank you.

138
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:54,350
Honey, I'm home.

139
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:01,024
Geez.

140
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:02,942
My people.

141
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:05,611
All right, let's go.

142
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:10,349
Hi.

143
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:12,902
I'm Bobby,
and I'm a ghost.

144
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:18,190
Hoping for a little
ghost orientation here.

145
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:23,046
Je m'appelle Bobby.

146
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:27,533
Chilly.

147
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:32,037
Annie?!

148
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:37,977
There's a whole lot
of something going on.

149
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,787
I know what you did
last night,

150
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:06,522
and you know
it was forbidden!

151
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:08,658
I don't brook that sort of thing
in my home.

152
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,095
Don't do it again, Dexter,
or there will be consequences.

153
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:19,102
The call to me
was the last one she made.

154
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:20,770
So where the hell is she?

155
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:23,005
Bobby?

156
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:25,775
Annie!

157
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:27,477
We've been looking
for you.

158
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,278
I can't believe
you're here.

159
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Yeah. I'm a doornail.

160
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,049
Bad news here.

161
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:36,969
If you can see me,
you are, too.

162
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,611
Wow.

163
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:57,380
Dead. Ghost.

164
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,963
Me.

165
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,316
Three words you never want
to use in a sentence.

166
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,003
I feel like I was drugged.

167
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,137
I get it.

168
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,121
I figure it was a month

169
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:08,923
before I even knew
I was still here.

170
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:09,874
You're doing well.

171
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,060
Terrific.
So, uh...

172
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:14,679
So, you duck your reaper,
too?

173
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,149
What? No.
I never even saw one.

174
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,767
You --

175
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,719
Bobby.

176
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,005
You ran away
from your reaper?

177
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,157
On purpose?

178
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,726
That's why
you're still here?

179
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,262
You stupid, crazy old --
hey.

180
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,998
I remember a time when you <i>liked</i>
how crazy I was.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,750
Oh, shut up!

182
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:37,168
I can't believe you.

183
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,319
You know what?

184
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,255
As a regular ghost
with no choice in the matter,

185
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:41,439
screw you.

186
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,309
Hey. I got unfinished business
here, same as you.

187
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,560
Uh-huh.

188
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,595
And there's my unfinished
business right now.

189
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:50,248
Kids!

190
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,583
Hello?

191
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,184
You're dead.

192
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,154
Well, they're not the brightest
bulbs on the string.

193
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,239
I came in,
they were roadkill.

194
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,475
Then this big guy
charges me.

195
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:02,677
And now I'm...

196
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,530
Crap.

197
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,650
Is there a fun aspect
to this?

198
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:09,817
Not really.

199
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:13,788
And so far, I can't crack
the code on any of it.

200
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,658
I mean, I've seen poltergeists
bench a piano as a warm-up.

201
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,576
I tried to help
the boys out once

202
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,444
by knocking a book
off the table

203
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,263
and blacked out
for two weeks.

204
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,832
So, Sam and Dean don't even know
you're here?

205
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:28,753
Wow.
That is messed up.

206
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,759
<i>Hey, Annie, I'm e-mailing</i>
<i>you those news clippings</i>

207
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:35,810
<i>that you asked for.</i>

208
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:37,428
We're redlining
all over the place.

209
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,479
Assume the worst?

210
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:39,430
Yeah, always do.

211
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,349
Okay.
Vengeful spirit.

212
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:43,318
Maybe lots of them.
Killing kids.

213
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,436
Look around.
No blood. No anything.

214
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,571
Certainly no bodies.

215
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,472
Well, if evil
is partying here,

216
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,474
it's got a hell
of a cleanup crew.

217
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,609
Wait, wait, wait.

218
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,477
What?

219
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,446
Here's something.

220
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,448
- From earlier this week.
- Okay.

221
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,601
<i>Free me.</i>

222
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:01,085
<i>Free me.</i>

223
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,620
Where'd that come from?

224
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:06,708
You ever seen a phone number
look like that?

225
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:24,609
All right, that's cool.

226
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,444
Excuse me. Hey!

227
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,380
Boss!

228
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:30,381
Dick.

229
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:31,766
Yeah, well...

230
00:12:31,768 --> 00:12:36,020
Ghosts ain't the most sociable
type to come down the pike.

231
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,356
But if he can do it...

232
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:46,197
Balls.

233
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,348
Graceful.

234
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,001
Novices.

235
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,838
You all make
the same mistakes.

236
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,679
Suppose <i>you</i> know
all about it.

237
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,264
Well, I've been
at it 80 years.

238
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:04,849
Yo, uh, fresh meat here.

239
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,051
Not even sure
what happened.

240
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,519
Really?

241
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:12,073
I got shot right in the melon,
never felt a thing.

242
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:13,441
You?

243
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:16,694
I was stabbed brutally,

244
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:21,432
right here at this bar,
April 17, 1932.

245
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,784
Who done ya?

246
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:26,621
I'm really very busy.

247
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:29,674
How come there's so many dead
folk in this place, anyway?

248
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,793
You know anything about that?

249
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:33,544
I guess we're not supposed
to talk about that.

250
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,596
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

251
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:39,250
Uh, my friend is
a little nosy, mister...?

252
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,936
Crane --
Haskel Crane.

253
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:43,588
Haskel...

254
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,522
you're right.

255
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,274
We <i>are</i> novices,

256
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:47,892
so, could you do me
a solid

257
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,395
and show me how to move
that chair?

258
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:53,781
It's one stupid chair.

259
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:57,235
Baby steps, gorgeous.

260
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,371
Try this first.

261
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,955
You're angsting at it.

262
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,808
You know what getting frustrated
will get you?

263
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,260
Nothing.

264
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,929
You've got two ways
to move things.

265
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,098
What I did --
which you obviously must --

266
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,783
is calm yourself.

267
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,019
You're saying
we should move crap

268
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,021
with the power of Zen.

269
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:37,141
I'm telling you
to let go of all <i>that.</i>

270
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:40,828
Calmly tell the thing
what to do.

271
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,498
You're getting tense.

272
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,918
You're not helpful.

273
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:52,423
What's option 2?
You said there were two ways.

274
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:55,826
Oh, you could use explosive
anger and pure, red-hot rage,

275
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,296
but that's impossible
to manufacture.

276
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,663
Sorry.

277
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,048
Makes sense.

278
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,634
Like poltergeists --
vengeful spirits.

279
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,719
I <i>am</i> vengeful.

280
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:06,354
You think I don't have
red-hot rage?

281
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:08,790
I think you're a sad excuse
for one of us,

282
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,608
and I'm unsurprised
that you're failing.

283
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,026
Take my help or don't,

284
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:14,428
but if you want
to move a flea,

285
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,947
surrender.

286
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:21,986
For the record,
I hated that Swayze flick --

287
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,988
romantic bullcrap.

288
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,716
What in cold hell
was <i>that?</i>

289
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:38,035
That's <i>you</i> one day.

290
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,220
That's all of us.

291
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,889
We deteriorate
at different rates --

292
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:43,541
some sooner, some later.

293
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,877
And eventually all...

294
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,929
like that.

295
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,736
Nothing left at all.

296
00:15:57,406 --> 00:16:00,057
Ghost Alzheimer's.

297
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,577
I'm liking this less.

298
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,728
Well, that is every square inch
of this place.

299
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,666
No bodies, no pieces
of bodies -- no Annie.

300
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,484
A whole lot of sizzle
and no steak.

301
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,753
Well, maybe no news
is good news.

302
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:13,921
Meaning?

303
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:15,840
Meaning maybe
she's just not here.

304
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:16,958
Maybe she's still okay.

305
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,893
Yeah, and what does
your gut say?

306
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,714
Let's just see if there's
anything else in her research.

307
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,217
Sam! Dean!

308
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,553
Honey, don't you think
I've tried that?

309
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,238
I shouted myself hoarse.

310
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,973
But I'm right here!

311
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:33,140
Well, now you know
how all the ghosts

312
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:34,475
who have ever tried to talk
to <i>us</i> feel.

313
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:36,994
You just have to wait
until they find you.

314
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,263
But I don't even know
where I'm at.

315
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,899
And I've searched every room
five times.

316
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,920
No wonder
they're walking away.

317
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,273
Is it me,
or am I being checked out?

318
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,045
No, stud.
<i>I'm</i> being checked out.

319
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,134
Can I help you?

320
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:02,320
I'm Victoria.

321
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,804
Annie.

322
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,339
I saw you here
the other day.

323
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,291
I know the kind
of work you do.

324
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,309
Did.

325
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:10,294
Hey, I'm <i>still</i> doing it.

326
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:13,080
I mean, other-dimensionally
speaking.

327
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:14,815
Attagirl.

328
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:17,234
Wait. Your voice.

329
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,120
You're the one
on my phone.

330
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,238
When you were here, I was able
to call out to you that way.

331
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,824
Ah, spectral voice
transference.

332
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:26,310
Right. Ghost juju.

333
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,578
Sure.

334
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,780
So...

335
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,699
W-what exactly did you mean
when you said, "free me"?

336
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:34,919
Victoria,
free you from what?

337
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,941
Bobby!

338
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:42,677
Where'd Annie get her intel?
Do we know?

339
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:45,546
Stupid flask.

340
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:47,932
Bodega Bay
Heritage Society.

341
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,266
Boys, come on.

342
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,852
All the action's
back in the pool.

343
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:52,520
Let's go!

344
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,023
Damn it.

345
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:59,810
The house dates back
to the mid-19th century.

346
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,047
Miles Van Ness made his fortune
in the gold rush,

347
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,150
eventually settling his family
in Bodega Bay.

348
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,019
Anything...unusual ever happen
in the house?

349
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,238
Over the course
of a century,

350
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,975
things are going to happen
in a house.

351
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:15,409
"Tell it what to do."

352
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,495
Some locals swear
it's haunted.

353
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,797
Move.
Every village has its idiots.

354
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,366
We only want
the real scoop, of course.

355
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,217
Balls!

356
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:24,719
Whitman Van Ness.

357
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:26,303
Son and heir.

358
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,339
Handsome, charming,

359
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,424
dogged by tragedy
all his life.

360
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:33,077
He lost the family fortune,
then the house.

361
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,545
It became a bordello.

362
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:37,732
He lived in isolation
till his death at age 40.

363
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:39,316
He's <i>still</i> there.

364
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,068
Who's the, uh,
the bruiser there?

365
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,839
Dexter O'Connell.
A convict.

366
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:46,557
An extremely violent man.

367
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,525
He's there, too.

368
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,560
Mr. Van Ness
was socially progressive

369
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,628
and took pity on him.

370
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,063
He worked
as grounds keeper.

371
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,666
Dexter was convicted
for murdering Whitman's fianc?e

372
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,351
on the eve
of their wedding.

373
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:02,123
Another calamitous event
in the poor man's life.

374
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,125
Well, thank you.

375
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:07,044
The house <i>is</i> popular
this week.

376
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,379
What do you mean?

377
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,514
A lady came by
the other day

378
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,082
asking all sorts
of questions.

379
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,835
Uh, 30s, red hair, good-looking?
Mm.

380
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:18,706
I gave her the same advice
I'll give to you.

381
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,307
Stay away from the place.

382
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:23,227
It's extremely unsafe.

383
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,819
So, besides Whitman's fianc?e,

384
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:33,370
Dexter O'Connell
was also convicted

385
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,773
of killing a bunch of hookers
who worked at the brothel.

386
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,292
He escaped
before they could hang him.

387
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:40,077
But then he returned
to the house,

388
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,213
where he was found
shot to death.

389
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:45,583
Why would he escape

390
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,235
and then go right back to
the house where he got arrested?

391
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:49,286
I don't know.

392
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,472
Add that to a list of things
I don't know.

393
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:52,473
So what's the next move?

394
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:53,758
You know, if I could,

395
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,011
I'd be getting old waiting
on you two to figure this out.

396
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,133
All right, now.

397
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,403
I can kill werewolves,
fix a Pinto,

398
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,089
and bake cornbread.

399
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:11,392
I will be damned
if I can't get Zen.

400
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:15,946
We're posting this video
as a warning about...

401
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,782
Or possibly
a memorial to...

402
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,918
Our friends Debbie Tellen
and Dudley Scott,

403
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,586
last known whereabouts...

404
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,987
The Van Ness house...

405
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,290
Since the cops
haven't done crap...

406
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:29,660
In what may be the final moments
of their love story.

407
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,763
They've been together
since like eighth grade.

408
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,766
Yeah. They entered this house
and texted us.

409
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,802
We're going in.

410
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:42,056
Ooh-ooh-ooh.

411
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:49,530
Sam?

412
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:51,615
What?

413
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,734
Tell me you wrote that.

414
00:20:58,206 --> 00:20:59,390
Uh...

415
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,059
No.
No, I didn't.

416
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,713
They came
into the house...

417
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,385
Well, then, who's there?

418
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,704
I said, who's there?!

419
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:38,662
Bobby?

420
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,748
They walked through...

421
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,117
these halls...

422
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:45,286
Seeking a grotto
of love.

423
00:21:45,288 --> 00:21:46,403
Seriously?

424
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,691
Bobby?!

425
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,878
Yes.

426
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,547
This whole time, we've been
trying to talk ourselves out of it,

427
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,682
he's been --
what's he doing here?

428
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,604
Dude.

429
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:04,688
We don't have time for this!

430
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,273
Get your asses back
to that house!

431
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:08,642
We got to get back
to that house, stat.

432
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:11,779
What happened?

433
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:18,586
Hello?

434
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:24,575
You shouldn't have
come here!

435
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:28,963
Dexter.

436
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:32,716
I expressly forbid you!
Enough!

437
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:36,303
Thank you.

438
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:56,924
Dexter, you tried
to warn them away.

439
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,926
You have enough of us.

440
00:22:58,928 --> 00:23:01,895
They're just children,
Whitman.

441
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:04,615
I can't watch this happen
all over again.

442
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:09,036
Shut up.

443
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:49,589
Ah, Victoria.
Grab the camera.

444
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:51,257
No. I can't.

445
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,594
We don't meddle
in Whitman's affairs.

446
00:23:54,596 --> 00:23:58,214
Hold it.
Let's get real.

447
00:23:58,216 --> 00:24:00,467
You sent me the S.O.S.,
and now I'm here.

448
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:02,185
So, give me a hand.

449
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:04,554
But now
he can get you, too.

450
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:06,656
Get me how?
I'm already dead.

451
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,610
Okay, you want to
help me understand?

452
00:24:10,612 --> 00:24:12,345
Exactly what did he do
to Dexter?

453
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:13,596
Punished him.

454
00:24:13,598 --> 00:24:15,465
He was trying
to warn them.

455
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,233
He tried
to warn you, too.

456
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:20,036
He drained him.

457
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:22,739
Drained?
What does that mean?

458
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:23,573
That's why he's so strong

459
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:25,041
and why you should
stay out of sight.

460
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:28,578
We're merely food to him --
food and perverse entertainment.

461
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:33,500
So, when he does that,
what happens?

462
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:35,385
Just...poof?

463
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:37,086
Forever.

464
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:41,558
See, I thought that Whitman
was some poor guy,

465
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,059
and Dexter
killed his fianc?e.

466
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:45,045
No. Whitman framed him.

467
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:46,312
Whitman killed
all of us.

468
00:24:46,314 --> 00:24:48,081
When this house
was a brothel,

469
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,984
I worked here
as a fancy lady.

470
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:52,368
He slit my throat.

471
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,936
"Fancy lady"? A hooker?

472
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:55,538
Please.

473
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,939
And now, even in death,

474
00:24:56,941 --> 00:24:59,442
every soul he traps here
makes him stronger.

475
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:02,128
Okay, so, where does
he keep the bodies?

476
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,329
I don't know.

477
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:04,547
Victoria,
you've been here forever.

478
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:06,366
You don't
follow him around.

479
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:13,590
Listen, we are going to pull
the plug on this bastard.

480
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:16,009
Now grab the damn camera.

481
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:19,179
Oh, dear.

482
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:23,800
It's him!

483
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:53,096
We combed the crap
out of this place.

484
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:55,498
If Annie's in there
and we didn't find her...

485
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,267
It's 'cause something
didn't want us to.

486
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:59,686
Awesome. Well, let's walk
right into <i>that.</i>

487
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:11,848
All right, I'll check upstairs.
Yeah.

488
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:16,352
Annie?!

489
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:19,873
Sorry, boys.
I'm leaving the pack.

490
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:22,826
It's Dean! And Sam!

491
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:29,916
That's not odd.

492
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,845
Sam, get back down here!

493
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:44,764
Annie?

494
00:26:47,718 --> 00:26:49,385
Slimer?

495
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:52,772
What?

496
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:55,108
Check it out.

497
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,278
<i>The final moments</i>
<i>of their love story.</i>

498
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,079
<i>They've been together</i>
<i>since like eighth grade.</i>

499
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:01,915
<i>Yeah. They entered this house</i>
<i>and texted us.</i>

500
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:03,900
Oh, I hate these Indie films.
Nothing ever happens.

501
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:06,619
<i>They came into the house.</i>

502
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:09,372
<i>They walked</i>
<i>through these halls.</i>

503
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:10,723
Wait, wait.
Pause it.

504
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:12,425
Frame back a little bit.

505
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:14,460
Stop.

506
00:27:14,462 --> 00:27:17,013
She's here,
and not in a good way.

507
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,716
Give them a moment.

508
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:22,085
They've got a little slower
since I left.

509
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:24,086
Annie?!

510
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:26,639
Got to let them know
that I'm here.

511
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:29,359
You have to do it.
We can't.

512
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:31,027
It's too dangerous.

513
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:33,563
These guys can help.

514
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:35,815
They just need to know
that we're here.

515
00:27:40,938 --> 00:27:42,739
Whoa!

516
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:44,741
Please. I'm Victoria --
Victoria Dodd.

517
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:46,509
Where'd you come from?

518
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:48,094
Here.

519
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,029
I was a fancy lady.

520
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:51,948
A hooker?

521
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:57,420
Uh, is Annie here?

522
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:58,554
Yes.

523
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,008
You can't see her.

524
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:04,644
No, you're not
standing on her.

525
00:28:04,646 --> 00:28:07,313
- You want to just tell them?
- I will.

526
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:10,299
In my day, we believed
in polite conversation.

527
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:13,269
Annie's in
terrible danger.

528
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:14,621
We all are.

529
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:16,572
- From?
- Whitman Van Ness.

530
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:17,473
But he's dead.

531
00:28:17,475 --> 00:28:19,876
I thought you said
they were <i>good.</i>

532
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:22,078
Hey, I'm just processing,
okay, lady?

533
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,096
He's dead. You're dead.

534
00:28:23,098 --> 00:28:24,330
Define "terrible danger."

535
00:28:24,332 --> 00:28:26,899
Whitman has great power
over all of us in the house.

536
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:27,934
He killed Annie.

537
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:31,571
She says
you can free us.

538
00:28:31,573 --> 00:28:33,840
Please, you must --

539
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,969
Victoria?

540
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:48,855
I'm gonna say she was
telling the truth,

541
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:50,940
considering that she just...
Got ghost-killed.

542
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:52,642
So, what?
Whitman Van Ness?

543
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:55,778
Now we know whose bones
to salt and burn.

544
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,397
Let's go.

545
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,551
Aw, hell no.

546
00:29:32,824 --> 00:29:34,508
If I hadn't stashed
that flask here,

547
00:29:34,585 --> 00:29:36,168
I'd still be glued
to Sam and Dean.

548
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,336
Real clever.

549
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:39,171
- Actually was.
- Son of a bitch.

550
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:41,290
I figured our one ace
was that bastard Whitman

551
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,042
couldn't leave
the house either.

552
00:29:43,044 --> 00:29:45,461
Must have pulled a number
like you and the flask.

553
00:29:45,463 --> 00:29:47,454
Probably planted something
on the boys.

554
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,264
Terrific.

555
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:49,682
Hey, listen, sweetie --

556
00:29:49,684 --> 00:29:52,601
you could beat yourself up
all day about this,

557
00:29:52,603 --> 00:29:56,155
or we could take advantage of
the fact that Whitman's gone,

558
00:29:56,157 --> 00:29:58,140
do what
we're supposed to do.

559
00:29:58,142 --> 00:29:59,858
Let's go figure this out.

560
00:30:00,977 --> 00:30:03,062
Coming, Robert?

561
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:11,036
Well, we searched
everywhere else.

562
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,873
I'm telling you, Whitman guards
his room like Fort Knox.

563
00:30:26,252 --> 00:30:30,506
Last time I checked,
ghosts didn't get cold.

564
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:34,226
Yeah.
That's Victoria.

565
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:35,878
That is how
he took her out.

566
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,746
But where did he get
her corpse?

567
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:40,532
Well, you said he dragged
those two dead kids away.

568
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:41,800
Where'd he take them?

569
00:30:41,802 --> 00:30:44,269
Yeah, I don't know.
I couldn't risk following him.

570
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:46,772
What else did you say
this place was,

571
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:48,407
other than a whorehouse?

572
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:50,109
It was a lot of things.

573
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:52,361
It was a boarding house,
a school...

574
00:30:52,363 --> 00:30:54,146
A speakeasy.

575
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:57,883
Yeah, well,
thing about speakeasies --

576
00:30:57,885 --> 00:31:00,169
hell of a lot to hide.

577
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:31,850
Still got it.

578
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:59,544
Well, this pretty much
tells the story, don't it?

579
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:01,563
You know, you and me --

580
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:04,750
we burned our fair share
of bones,

581
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:07,286
sent a lot
of ghosts packing.

582
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:10,722
It's a little different

583
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:13,108
when you're on
the receiving end.

584
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,195
So, uh...

585
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:20,749
...what do you think
happens to 'em --

586
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:23,485
heaven, hell, or...

587
00:32:23,487 --> 00:32:27,372
none of the above?

588
00:32:27,374 --> 00:32:30,042
I don't know.

589
00:32:30,044 --> 00:32:32,261
Just...gone,

590
00:32:32,263 --> 00:32:34,246
most likely.

591
00:32:35,682 --> 00:32:39,268
Yeah,
that's what I think, too.

592
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,553
That's what I want.

593
00:32:41,555 --> 00:32:43,555
I want a Hunter's funeral.

594
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:45,691
Oh, come on.

595
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:47,709
It's better than this --

596
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:50,028
stuck to this house,

597
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,698
somewhere between existing
and not.

598
00:32:54,851 --> 00:32:57,269
No, I'm...

599
00:32:57,271 --> 00:32:59,822
ready for some peace.

600
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,076
Wasn't much of a life.

601
00:33:04,078 --> 00:33:06,128
It was lonely,
what we do.

602
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,330
Yeah, well, the life I had
is the one I picked.

603
00:33:08,332 --> 00:33:10,499
Yeah,
but you had the boys.

604
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:14,436
All I had was work.

605
00:33:14,438 --> 00:33:15,804
It's gone now.

606
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:17,289
Yeah, well, I <i>ain't</i> done.

607
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,891
Okay, fine, but I am.

608
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:23,312
You're stronger
than I am now, Bobby,

609
00:33:23,314 --> 00:33:25,547
so, uh, you got to do this
for me.

610
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:33,522
All right. Here we go --
cemetery, edge of town.

611
00:33:33,524 --> 00:33:36,174
The Van Ness family
has its own mausoleum.

612
00:33:36,176 --> 00:33:39,745
All right, we light up
the bastard and finish him off.

613
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,118
Take it easy.
We'll get there.

614
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,287
Uh, that's not me.

615
00:34:05,438 --> 00:34:07,139
Why's he with us?!

616
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:08,140
I don't know.

617
00:34:08,142 --> 00:34:10,642
There's got to be
something on us!

618
00:34:10,644 --> 00:34:12,194
Hey, hey.

619
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:13,729
Ugh!

620
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:14,396
Sam!

621
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:16,448
Aah!

622
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:25,490
Did that do it?
Did that get rid of him?

623
00:34:25,492 --> 00:34:26,658
I don't know.
I got a bad idea

624
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,327
we just snapped him back
to his favorite house.

625
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:29,628
Where Annie's
a sitting duck.

626
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,046
We got to find those bones.
Come on.

627
00:34:31,048 --> 00:34:32,881
Let's build up the fire.

628
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:37,386
We can put some of these poor
bastards to rest, at least.

629
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:52,434
Well, let's get to cremating.
We ain't got all day.

630
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:24,850
Enjoy the view
from my room?

631
00:35:24,852 --> 00:35:27,269
Planning to thin out
the population?

632
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:32,307
Is this how you repay
my hospitality?!

633
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:46,571
No!
I will not be taken!

634
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,017
How long was I out?

635
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:17,135
A while.

636
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:18,186
Are you okay?

637
00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:20,822
Sure.

638
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:26,028
I mean...I'm dead,

639
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,163
I'm a ghost...

640
00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:31,366
but, basically, swell.

641
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:36,505
Hi, boys.

642
00:36:39,892 --> 00:36:41,209
Bobby?

643
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:44,379
Wait.

644
00:36:44,381 --> 00:36:46,848
You can see me?

645
00:36:57,191 --> 00:36:59,593
You're staring,
you know.

646
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:04,264
Annie's here, too,
by the way.

647
00:37:06,484 --> 00:37:07,651
Hi, Annie.

648
00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:08,685
H-hi, Annie.

649
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:09,903
Hi, guys.

650
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:14,908
She says you both look uglier
than she remembered.

651
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:20,063
Bobby,
h-how'd you stay here?

652
00:37:20,065 --> 00:37:22,382
Yeah, well, uh...

653
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,292
suck on that, Swayze.

654
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:36,113
That's why
you never answered me.

655
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:37,481
I tried calling you --

656
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:39,266
the, uh, talking board,

657
00:37:39,268 --> 00:37:42,686
the works --
but I was always alone.

658
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:45,989
Dean always had that thing
in his pocket.

659
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:48,358
That's why the EMF only went off
half the time.

660
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,210
We thought
we were going crazy.

661
00:37:50,212 --> 00:37:51,628
S-so, what happened?

662
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,147
Did you get stuck
or -- or what?

663
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:56,700
I <i>wanted</i> to stay.

664
00:37:58,036 --> 00:37:59,069
Bobby.

665
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,370
I need to help.

666
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,727
Not if it means
you have to...be this.

667
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:09,813
Well, life wasn't comfy.
Why should death be?

668
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:11,748
Now, come on.

669
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,034
Annie and I
found all the bodies.

670
00:38:14,036 --> 00:38:15,201
Let's put 'em to rest.

671
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:18,805
And keep my damn flask away
from the fire...

672
00:38:18,807 --> 00:38:21,108
Obviously.

673
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:26,680
Well, you coming?

674
00:38:38,225 --> 00:38:40,177
I'll miss her.

675
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:42,863
Me too.

676
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:44,114
Yeah.

677
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,366
Well, you didn't know her
like I did.

678
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:54,508
Well, uh

679
00:38:56,144 --> 00:38:57,761
Here's to Annie.

680
00:38:57,763 --> 00:39:01,431
She got the Hunter's funeral
she wanted.

681
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:06,586
Kind of like the one
we thought we gave you.

682
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:08,588
Dean.

683
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,725
What were you thinking,
Bobby?

684
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,095
You could be in heaven
right now,

685
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:17,597
drinking beer at Harvelle's,
not -- not stuck --

686
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,066
stuck here with you?

687
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:21,702
We still have work to do.

688
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:24,404
I just thought that was
kind of important, Dean.

689
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:29,976
It's not right.
You know that.

690
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:33,363
Sorry.
You're right.

691
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:35,665
What was I thinking?

692
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:53,133
So, what do you think
we should do?

693
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:56,069
We <i>did</i> what we should do.

694
00:39:56,071 --> 00:39:57,604
Now I don't know.

695
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:04,611
I mean, do you think
it's possible we could --

696
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:07,864
I don't know --
make it all work somehow?

697
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:10,450
I have no idea.
Maybe.

698
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:12,886
I've never heard of it.

699
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:17,157
But you know
what I do know?

700
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,176
It ain't the natural order
of things.

701
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:22,512
Everything
is supposed to end.

702
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:24,464
You know,
he was supposed --

703
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:31,171
And now...

704
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:34,057
What are the odds
this ends well?

705
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:37,894
What are the odds?
