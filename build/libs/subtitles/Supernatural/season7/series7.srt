1
00:00:02,626 --> 00:00:03,702
Hi, Amy.

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:06,705
You know me. You know
the kind of person I am.

3
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,974
She's dropping bodies, man,
which means we got to drop her.

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,476
She's done.
Trust me.

5
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:11,894
Okay.

6
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,180
You are what you are.
You will kill again.

7
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:15,097
What's going on with you?

8
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:17,933
You are what you are.

9
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,384
What the hell
are you talking about?

10
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,270
I'm talking about whatever
you're not telling me about.

11
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,354
I know you didn't want
to let her go,

12
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:24,657
but it was the right thing
to do.

13
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,025
So, thanks.
No problem.

14
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:26,975
You know my motto --
"here to help."

15
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:28,974
Kind of like
you helped Amy?

16
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:30,199
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:33,061
You should just
go on without me.

18
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:36,852
All right.

19
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:48,726
Yes.

20
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,095
A spirit has gathered
around us.

21
00:00:52,614 --> 00:00:54,832
Are you with us,
spirit?

22
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:04,108
I feel something.

23
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:06,059
I have goose bumps.

24
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:08,278
Uncle Danny?

25
00:01:08,363 --> 00:01:10,197
We're going to
make contact now.

26
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:12,783
Rest your hands
on the planchette.

27
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:17,237
Let the spirit
guide our hands.

28
00:01:19,073 --> 00:01:20,457
O spirit,

29
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:24,545
are you
the one we seek?

30
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:26,380
Are you...

31
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,415
Uncle Danny?

32
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,270
I'm not doing that.

33
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:35,222
Yeah.
She's pushing it.

34
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,911
It's okay
to be skeptical.

35
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,283
Danny,
if you're with us,

36
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:48,569
knock twice for yes.

37
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:52,156
Danny?

38
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:56,109
Can you ask him,
is he happy?

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,947
He is. He's happy.

40
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:02,166
Is sadie with him?

41
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:03,950
Now you're being
ridiculous, Cynthia.

42
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:04,968
Who cares about Sadie?

43
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:06,920
Ah, yes.

44
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:08,722
I see...

45
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:11,258
A family pet.

46
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:13,394
That's her.
Sadie was a Schnauzer.

47
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:17,898
She's with Danny, chasing
tennis balls in the afterlife.

48
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,400
Sadie loved
tennis balls.

49
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:21,735
There were
important papers.

50
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:24,405
No one can find them.
They weren't in the safe.

51
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:26,023
Can you
just ask him...

52
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:27,408
Of course.

53
00:02:27,475 --> 00:02:30,944
I'll need you to place
your hands with me

54
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:32,312
on the planchette.

55
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:40,454
Maybe --

56
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:42,956
maybe Danny didn't like
the question.

57
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:44,825
Tell him
to quit fooling around.

58
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:46,176
He knows darn well
that's my money.

59
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:52,549
Can't you two
stop squabbling?

60
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:55,803
For Pete's sake,
he's dead.

61
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:57,438
Tell him we're sorry.

62
00:02:57,505 --> 00:03:00,307
Maybe if we're nice,
he'll --

63
00:03:02,727 --> 00:03:03,977
oh, my God.

64
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:04,862
Danny?

65
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:12,870
What's going on?

66
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:21,745
Run!

Yeah.

00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,554
O spirits of the further...

82
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:29,790
am I going to win
the Powerball?

83
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,159
I'm gonna be rich.

84
00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:20,807
Hello!

85
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,225
First time
at Good Graces?

86
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,727
Yes.

87
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,212
Well, we're 100%
locally sourced, biodynamic,

88
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:28,665
and you get a free affirmation
with every order.

89
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:33,553
Think I'll source
a taco joint.

90
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:37,190
Just coffee,
black, extra shot.

91
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:43,080
You always wear a suit
to get your palm read?

92
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:48,068
Yeah. Not surprised
you caught this one.

93
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,570
It's on every morning zoo
in America.

94
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:51,955
You mind?

95
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,591
So, I, uh,
I went to the scene.

96
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:57,594
Wires, speakers, enough E.M.F.
to make your hair stand up.

97
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,880
Don't even think
about getting a reading.

98
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,336
Oh, and, uh, if this
hadn't have been two

99
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,847
psychics that bit it...

100
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:06,453
I would have just chalked this up
as being dumb and accidental.

101
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:08,722
And I know, I know.

102
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:10,807
This whole town's
supposedly calling ghosts.

103
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:13,643
But that takes some serious
spellwork and some serious mojo.

104
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:16,063
The only books this lady had
were Oprah crap.

105
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:18,765
When was the last time
you actually saw a real psychic?

106
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:19,816
Huh? Pamela?

107
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,368
Missouri?

108
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:23,954
Anyway, this is good.
And, uh, how you been?

109
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:26,790
And what can I get
for you?

110
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:30,110
Uh, pancakes, side of pig.
Coffee, black.

111
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:31,444
Fantastic.

112
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:33,413
You are a virile manifestation
of the divine.

113
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:38,618
What the hell
did he say to me?

114
00:07:40,388 --> 00:07:41,788
Oh, it's funny?

115
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,257
Yeah, no. Go ahead.
Laugh it up, Sam. Hilarious.

116
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,097
Dean...

117
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,348
Oh, he speaks.

118
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,567
...Look...

119
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:54,484
Sam.

120
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:57,771
Look, we're both here.

121
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,573
All right, the chance
of either one of us leaving

122
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,074
while people are still dying
out there --

123
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:03,493
You might as well
bite the bullet

124
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:04,911
and work with me
on this one.

125
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,696
I don't know if I can.

126
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:07,947
I'm not asking you
to open up a can of worms.

127
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:08,825
Okay,
I'm not even asking you

128
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:10,422
where the hell you've been
for the past week and a half.

129
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:11,647
Good.

130
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,623
I'm just saying, let's
try and stop the killings.

131
00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:17,841
That's it.

132
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:21,011
Okay.

133
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:24,214
Okay? Good.

134
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:28,435
Can I help you?

135
00:08:28,502 --> 00:08:29,536
You're the brothers
from the --

136
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:31,004
Oh, no, no, no, no.

137
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:32,856
The Winchester guys on the news
a couple weeks back?

138
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,274
- No -- we get that a lot.
- Yeah, no.

139
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:35,859
Those depraved killers
got put down

140
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,394
like the dogs
that they were.

141
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:40,847
Us on the other hand,
we're completely harmless.

142
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:43,733
Oh, yeah!

143
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:45,535
I'm sorry. Silly me.

144
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,288
And I can see by your energies,
you're completely gentle.

145
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:51,825
Excuse my friend.
She's excitable.

146
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:55,712
Sweetheart, look at them, hmm?
They're FBI.

147
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:57,747
Oh!

148
00:08:57,832 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm Russian.
We can spot the law.

149
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:02,702
You must be here
about the tragedies.

150
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:05,672
Oh, we're just beside ourselves
about what happened.

151
00:09:05,723 --> 00:09:07,340
Yeah. And so close
to festival season, huh?

152
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:08,758
Yeah -- no --

153
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:09,926
Of course
we are worried.

154
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:12,512
We have no idea
what's going on, huh?

155
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:15,232
Nikolai.
Let me know if I can help you.

156
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:16,850
I'm highly intuitive.

157
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:18,885
Nikolai Lishin,
spoon bender?

158
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,320
Mm. World famous.

159
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:23,056
Come to my demonstration
at the festival, huh?

160
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:24,357
Ugh!

161
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:28,361
I teach you to harness
the power of your mind.

162
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:32,415
Come,
let's leave them be.

163
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:38,839
So glad we decided
to vacation here, huh? Right?

164
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:41,574
All right.
Here we go.

165
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:42,759
First death.

166
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:44,577
Second death.

167
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:46,963
What am I looking at?

168
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:48,348
Well, see this?

169
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:50,467
Now, this is Imelda Graven,
death number one.

170
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,418
She was brained
by her own crystal ball.

171
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,770
Bummer, and ironic.

172
00:09:57,174 --> 00:09:58,859
Same necklace?

173
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:00,644
Yeah. See, Imelda gave it
to Goldy in her will.

174
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:02,229
Okay, so,
cursed object, maybe?

175
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,596
Worth looking into.

176
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:06,616
Goldy's next of kin
lives in town, also a psychic.

177
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:08,601
Oh, good.
I haven't had my fill.

178
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:17,443
He broke my spoon.

179
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:31,675
Melanie Golden?

180
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,460
Hi.
Uh...Got a minute?

181
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:38,148
You want me to stay?

182
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:39,316
No, that's okay.

183
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,967
Okay.

184
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:42,402
Thanks for
stopping by, hon.

185
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:43,469
Of course.

186
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:48,308
A friend.

187
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:50,527
She just heard
about my grandmother...

188
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:52,696
Which is, I guess, why you guys
are here, so come on in.

189
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,784
Sorry.
I just got back.

190
00:10:57,835 --> 00:10:59,286
You were
out of town?

191
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:03,206
Yeah, I work the circuit --
hotels, conventions, you know.

192
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,207
Oh. Wait.

193
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:06,042
No offense, but...

194
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:07,928
You don't seem
all that psychic.

195
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:10,013
Why do you say that?

196
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:12,933
Well, I mean, just, you know,
where's all the...

197
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,384
crystals and pyramids?

198
00:11:14,468 --> 00:11:16,136
I'm off the clock.

199
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:18,805
Also not psychic.

200
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,674
What?
It's an honest living.

201
00:11:21,726 --> 00:11:24,277
Interesting definition
of "honest."

202
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,179
Well, I honestly
read people.

203
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,732
It's just less whoo-whoo,
more body language.

204
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,016
Like you two --

205
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:32,118
longtime partners,
but, um...

206
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:33,386
a lot of tension.

207
00:11:33,454 --> 00:11:34,955
You're pissed.

208
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:36,990
And you're stressed.

209
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,492
It's not brain surgery.

210
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:42,329
It's kind of why my grandma
and me didn't get along.

211
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,364
I mean,
she'd go full smoke-machine,

212
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:47,033
but she still actually believed
in all that stuff, so...

213
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:48,385
You don't?

214
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:49,669
You do?

215
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,221
I've got an open mind.

216
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:53,890
You'd be surprised.

217
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:55,592
Hmm.

218
00:11:58,095 --> 00:11:59,496
I'm sorry to have to ask,

219
00:11:59,563 --> 00:12:01,514
b-but there's a necklace
of your grandmother's.

220
00:12:01,565 --> 00:12:03,883
Don't have it. Everything
went straight to the emporium.

221
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:05,151
She had a deal
with the owner.

222
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:06,069
The emporium?

223
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:12,826
Mm.

224
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:14,060
You're looking...

225
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,078
for something.

226
00:12:15,162 --> 00:12:16,162
You're good.

227
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,897
- You "Jimmy Tomorrow"?
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,582
We're looking for
a necklace.

229
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,167
Oh. Romantic.

230
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:24,120
It would have come in
with grandma Goldy's effects.

231
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:26,840
Oh. Yes, yes.

232
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:30,393
Now, you do know that this
is the Orb of Thessaly.

233
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:32,295
We did not know.

234
00:12:34,715 --> 00:12:36,416
Very powerful,

235
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,051
very rare.

236
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:39,052
Let me guess.
Very expensive.

237
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:40,553
Worth every penny.

238
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,057
Well, in that case,

239
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:46,609
we'll be taking
the state's-evidence discount.

240
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:49,229
What's going on?

241
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,647
A murder investigation

242
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:53,149
that we'd like to personally
thank you for not obstructing.

243
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:55,902
You know, I give
private energetic readings.

244
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:57,454
No, thanks.

245
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:58,488
A loss weighs on you.

246
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:00,773
You're angry.

247
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:02,909
It's complicated.

248
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:05,578
Come see me, Agent.

249
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:16,456
Thanks, Jimmy.
We'll see you.

250
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:18,725
The bureau's gonna reimburse me
for the necklace, right?

251
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:20,176
Oh, we'll send you
a check.

252
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:22,812
Right.

253
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:30,136
Went a little "Mentalist"
on you there, didn't he?

254
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:33,740
All right. Next question.
What's an Orb of Thessaly?

255
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:36,642
I know one thing --
it's made in Taiwan.

256
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:39,746
Oh, a fake, around here.
Imagine that.

257
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:42,665
'Course, that means that
whatever's killing mediums

258
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,984
is still out there.

259
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:03,495
He probably
should have bent those

260
00:15:03,496 --> 00:15:05,464
with the power
of his mind.

261
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,510
Chief.

262
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:10,444
- We met at the station.
- Right. Morning, Agent.

263
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:12,380
Morning.
Uh, this is Agent Borne.

264
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:14,615
So, what happened?

265
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:17,585
It's a weird one.
Chest full of cutlery.

266
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:20,305
All right.
We're gonna take a look around.

267
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:21,723
Let us know
if you get any leads.

268
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,391
Oh, I got leads
coming out of my ass.

269
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,145
As of 9:00,
our tip line had 46 calls,

270
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:30,131
all from clairvoyants that know
what <i>really</i> happened.

271
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:31,733
What's the popular theory?

272
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,568
It's a toss-up
between a ghost

273
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:36,437
and some sort of ogre
that only attacks Russians.

274
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,990
Policing Lily Dale
sounds fun.

275
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:40,408
It was either this
or Los Angeles.

276
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:44,829
So, these clairvoyants,
did they give any details

277
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:47,031
as to why they thought
it was a ghost?

278
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:48,583
Or a...

279
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,318
Russian ogre?

280
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:51,419
Their spirit monkey
said so.

281
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,322
Plus, apparently,
this guy claims

282
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:56,374
he had a vision
of his own death,

283
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,342
cutlery and all.

284
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:03,131
Excuse me.

285
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:06,551
Hello?

286
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:09,554
Agent Borne?
It's Melanie Golden.

287
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:10,938
Everything okay?

288
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:13,007
Did you mean it when you said
you had an open mind?

289
00:16:15,811 --> 00:16:17,145
I hadn't checked it
until today.

290
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:19,197
I mean, the only person
who ever called my landline

291
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,198
was my grandma.

292
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:22,066
That's okay. Go on.

293
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:24,118
Look, I wouldn't
put any stock in it.

294
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:25,870
I mean,
she was always calling me

295
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:28,272
with some crazy dream
she was sure was a sign,

296
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,658
that kind of thing,
but...

297
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:33,745
Uh, is it true Nikolai
had a real vision of his death?

298
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:36,530
That's what
we were told, yeah.

299
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:38,583
Well, so did she --
the day she died.

300
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,084
What'd she say?

301
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:42,387
Well, you can listen to it
if you want.

302
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:44,255
She said
she was in a seance,

303
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,207
then the lights go,
it's freezing.

304
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:48,476
Wait, she said that?
That the room got cold?

305
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:51,429
Yeah. Why?
Is that important?

306
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:52,880
What? What is it?

307
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:55,099
A ghost.

308
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:57,352
The real deal.

309
00:16:57,403 --> 00:16:58,936
Come on.

310
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:02,690
You're serious.

311
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:03,858
Yeah.

312
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:05,893
See, there's, uh,
fake whoo-whoo crap,

313
00:17:05,944 --> 00:17:08,162
and there's
real whoo-whoo crap.

314
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,615
Well, yeah, but...

315
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:11,899
Ghosts?

316
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,067
Oh, trust me.

317
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:15,753
There's a lot weirder
out there than that.

318
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:17,121
So "The X-files" is real,

319
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:19,390
or you just stopped talking
like an FBI Agent.

320
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,260
Well, um...

321
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:23,461
We're not FBI agents.

322
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:28,182
I need a drink.

323
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,283
I support that.

324
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:35,473
You know,
if this is a spirit,

325
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:37,725
it ain't your average spook
tied to a house.

326
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:39,944
I mean, this thing
is boogieing all over town.

327
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:41,062
Not surprised.

328
00:17:41,113 --> 00:17:42,430
I mean,
how many crystal balls

329
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:44,782
do you figure there are
in Lily Dale?

330
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:47,902
Somewhere between 50
and, uh, all of them.

331
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:50,538
Well, I mean,
quartz can act

332
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,206
as an antenna
for spirits, right?

333
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:53,541
I mean,
that's why mediums

334
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:55,710
started using crystal balls
in the first place.

335
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:58,129
Well, that means that
every storefront in town

336
00:17:58,213 --> 00:17:59,797
has got a ghost
satellite dish.

337
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:01,165
Exactly.

338
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,468
And this place is packed
with people summoning spirits.

339
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:04,618
Yeah, but, dude,
most of these guys

340
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,586
can't even call a taxi.

341
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:06,671
All it takes is one.

342
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:08,122
That's gonna be like

343
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:10,975
looking for a needle
in a stack of fake needles.

344
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,059
It's worse.

345
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:13,227
I mean,
I'll bet you anything

346
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:14,479
some of these guys
got real juice.

347
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:15,796
I'm not talking
kill-people level.

348
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:17,982
I'm just saying,
enough to make it complicated.

349
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:18,983
I hate this town.

350
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,319
All right, so, what?

351
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:23,438
Start hitting up
the Miss Cleos?

352
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,022
I was thinking
split up and canvass.

353
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:26,307
It's faster.

354
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:30,695
Right.
'Course you were.

355
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:43,791
What is it?

356
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:45,209
My brother?

357
00:18:45,294 --> 00:18:46,878
Is he
going back to prison?

358
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:49,297
Stay away.

359
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:53,217
His curse
will drag you down.

360
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:58,339
Folks do turn jail
into a habit, you know?

361
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:01,675
Oh, no, no.

362
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:04,479
Don't fret.

363
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,113
I's always say,

364
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:07,515
family...

365
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:09,450
Is a pain in the ass
anyhow!

366
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,372
Thank you,
Sister Thibideaux.

367
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:17,074
No, child.

368
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:20,127
Thank the spirits.

369
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:24,298
Now, will that be
cash or credit?

370
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:47,655
It's okay.

371
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:50,024
Like I said on the phone,
he can help.

372
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:52,493
Phony lawman, huh?

373
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:55,530
Yeah, 'cause nobody
can relate to phony around here.

374
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:57,365
Well, if you can
do <i>something,</i>

375
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,367
I don't care
if you call yourself the Pope.

376
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:00,918
All right.
What happened, exactly?

377
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:02,453
What happened is,

378
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:04,288
I had a friggin' vision.

379
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:06,340
Something is coming for me.

380
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:07,741
What's coming?
Did you get a look?

381
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:09,076
No.

382
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:11,596
But I sure felt it when it
started breaking my bones.

383
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:15,633
I don't want to die.

384
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:17,134
Okay.
We'll figure it out.

385
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:18,886
The vision happened
in here?

386
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:21,389
Yeah, by the cash box.

387
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,374
There any chance
good-lookin' was watching?

388
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:50,284
What was that?

389
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:57,675
What the hell?!

390
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,894
Oh, my God.

391
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:01,529
Oh, my God!

392
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:02,980
W-was that, I mean,
an actual --

393
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:04,181
Bona fide. Yeah.

394
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:07,435
Well, no offense,

395
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:09,637
but nobody's having
psychic visions around here.

396
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:13,357
This, uh, spirit, whoever
she is, is giving them out.

397
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:15,493
And then killing people?

398
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:17,495
Until we stop her.

399
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:19,330
Well, the good news is
you said

400
00:21:19,414 --> 00:21:21,532
you saw a clock
and it read 2:00 a.m.,

401
00:21:21,617 --> 00:21:23,384
so that gives us
a little time.

402
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:27,254
Now, does anybody recognize
this chick?

403
00:21:27,322 --> 00:21:28,923
You know,
I swear I've seen her,

404
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,925
like in a painting
or something.

405
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:32,159
A painting? Like, a --

406
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,344
No, not a painting.

407
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,212
In one of those old photos
in the museum.

408
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:43,688
Lily Dale has long been a haven

409
00:21:43,772 --> 00:21:45,506
for the psychically gifted.

410
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:48,809
Tortured elsewhere,
they're embraced here.

411
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,697
My own family
has a modest natural gift.

412
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:54,482
We also celebrate

413
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:57,451
our long and colorful
history of...

414
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,570
Embellishers.

415
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:05,292
Ectoplasm illusion,
circa 1890.

416
00:22:26,898 --> 00:22:28,983
Never ended well
for the siblings.

417
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,735
Why is that?

418
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:33,654
Mm, the strain
of working together,

419
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:37,658
or maybe just being around
each other all their lives.

420
00:22:37,726 --> 00:22:40,578
Those two were the exception,
actually -- the Campbells.

421
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:41,829
Got along famously.

422
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:43,781
Of course,
that was just a stage name.

423
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,082
They weren't actually
brothers.

424
00:22:46,918 --> 00:22:49,737
That was a cover
for their, um...

425
00:22:49,788 --> 00:22:51,172
Alternative lifestyle.

426
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:55,743
Any other questions
I can answer?

427
00:22:55,794 --> 00:22:56,877
Yes. Who are they?

428
00:22:56,928 --> 00:22:59,213
Oh, the Fox sisters --

429
00:22:59,264 --> 00:23:00,931
among the founders
of Lily Dale.

430
00:23:01,016 --> 00:23:02,249
Kate Fox --

431
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,268
quite troubled,
apparently,

432
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:06,220
but mesmerizing onstage.

433
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:09,356
She's said
to be able to levitate objects

434
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:11,609
and foretell
one's death.

435
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:12,926
That's her.

436
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:14,779
Her older sister,
Margaret --

437
00:23:14,863 --> 00:23:17,198
perhaps not
a natural psychic.

438
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,315
So, full of crap.

439
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,933
Yes, well...

440
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:22,703
She didn't have
her sister's charisma,

441
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:25,406
but she
looked after Kate.

442
00:23:25,457 --> 00:23:28,659
Sometimes, one's true gift
is taking care of others.

443
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:32,463
So, what happened
to them?

444
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:33,464
Lived here
all their lives.

445
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:35,166
Lived here
and died here?

446
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,803
Yes, well...
buried in the cemetery.

447
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:41,672
Great.
That was very educational.

448
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:42,807
Thank you.

449
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:43,891
Dean.

450
00:23:48,313 --> 00:23:50,564
I don't normally do this
during business hours,

451
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:52,349
but do you know
an Eleanor...

452
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:54,185
or an Ellen?

453
00:23:56,404 --> 00:23:59,023
She seems quite concerned
about you.

454
00:23:59,107 --> 00:24:01,859
She wants to tell you --

455
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:03,944
pardon me --

456
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:06,831
if you don't tell someone
how bad it really is,

457
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:09,083
she'll kick your ass
from beyond.

458
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,670
You have to trust someone
again eventually.

459
00:24:16,675 --> 00:24:20,661
Anyway, don't forget to visit
the gift shop.

460
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:27,601
All right.

461
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,603
Hit up the graveyard,
dig up Kate?

462
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:31,171
All right.
Wait a second.

463
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:32,973
All signs
point to her, Dean.

464
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,175
No. Just hold on
a damn minute.

465
00:24:35,227 --> 00:24:36,560
Enough with
"just the facts."

466
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:38,345
We agreed --

467
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:39,980
No, we agreed
to work the case.

468
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:41,732
We didn't agree for you to be
a dick the whole time.

469
00:24:41,817 --> 00:24:43,067
What?

470
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:44,285
You're pissed, okay?

471
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:46,453
- And you've got a right.
- Yeah, damn straight.

472
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:47,788
- But enough's enough.
- Says who?

473
00:24:47,856 --> 00:24:50,858
Look, I'll work
this damn case,

474
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:54,578
but you lied to me,
and you killed my friend.

475
00:24:55,797 --> 00:24:58,048
No, I put down a monster
who killed four people,

476
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:00,885
and if you didn't know her,
you'd have done the same thing.

477
00:25:00,969 --> 00:25:02,136
I <i>did</i> know her, Dean.

478
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:03,871
Yeah, which is why
you couldn't do it.

479
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:05,706
Look, I get it.

480
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:07,224
There are certain people
in this world,

481
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:09,209
no matter how dangerous
they are, you just can't.

482
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:11,145
Don't pull that card.
That's bull.

483
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:12,980
Look, if I've learned
one thing,

484
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:15,099
it's that if something
feels wrong, it probably is!

485
00:25:15,183 --> 00:25:17,718
Usually, yeah.
But killing Amy was not wrong.

486
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:19,103
You couldn't do it,
so I did.

487
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:21,772
That's what family does --
the dirty work.

488
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:24,909
And I would have told you
eventually,

489
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:27,194
once I knew that this whole
"waving a gun at Satan" thing

490
00:25:27,245 --> 00:25:28,395
was a one-time show.

491
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:29,864
I think it's reasonable
to want to know

492
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:31,782
that you're off
the friggin' high dive, Sam.

493
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,167
You almost
got us both killed,

494
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:34,902
so you can be pissed
all you want,

495
00:25:34,953 --> 00:25:36,069
but quit being a bitch.

496
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:03,564
I get
why she's killing people.

497
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:05,933
I don't get
why she's warning them.

498
00:26:08,954 --> 00:26:10,704
Give them a taste
of the curse, maybe?

499
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:14,775
It couldn't have been
a joyride.

500
00:26:14,826 --> 00:26:16,543
Here we go.

501
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:23,467
Sam!

502
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:25,002
Back off, crazy eyes.

503
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:26,136
Listen to me.

504
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:28,305
Why isn't anybody
listening?

505
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,306
No.

506
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:31,175
You don't get a vote.
No! Stop!

507
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:33,394
No!

508
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:43,470
Nice timing.

509
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:49,076
Got it.

510
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,744
And, Dean, thanks.

511
00:26:51,813 --> 00:26:53,664
They took care of it.

512
00:26:56,451 --> 00:26:58,102
Okay, so...

513
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:00,471
What -- just go home?

514
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:02,206
I guess.

515
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:09,263
Hey, why don't you come
stay with me a couple days?

516
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,330
Thanks.

517
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:14,685
Just one more minute.

518
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:15,769
It's fine, hon.

519
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:17,137
Oh, if you had
that vision,

520
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:19,056
you wouldn't want
to be here either.

521
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:30,617
Camille, it's okay.
Let's just go.

522
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:37,074
What is it?

523
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:42,529
Call them back! Now!

524
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,916
Melanie?

525
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:47,134
Dean,
you have to come back.

526
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:48,368
What's going on?

527
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,703
It's still happening!

528
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:51,038
Wait, what
do you mean it's --

529
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:52,840
She's still coming! Just tell me
what the hell to do!

530
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:54,224
All right. Listen to me.
Calm down.

531
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:55,726
Dean, just give me the phone
and drive.

532
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,428
Melanie? Hey.
Get to the kitchen.

533
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:58,896
Okay.

534
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:02,399
- Aah!
- She's here!

535
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:04,268
- All right, just go. Get salt.
- Aah!

536
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:13,027
It worked.
She's gone!

537
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:16,530
No, she's back!

538
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:18,499
Aah!
I'm out of salt!

539
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:20,284
Find iron.
Is there a fireplace?

540
00:28:20,368 --> 00:28:21,118
Melanie!

541
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:32,629
Aah!

542
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:33,964
Oh, God! Mel!

543
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:39,053
Camille! Camille!

544
00:28:39,104 --> 00:28:40,170
Camille! No!
Aah!

545
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:03,461
Should have known that whole
"good sis, bad sis" story

546
00:29:03,462 --> 00:29:04,830
was just showmanship crap.

547
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:06,690
Oh, and it turns out

548
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:08,942
that Kate was just
trying to warn people

549
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:10,527
about her evil bitch
sister.

550
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:12,513
And we burned her bones,
so that's gone.

551
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,697
- Dean.
- What?

552
00:29:13,748 --> 00:29:15,015
All we can do now
is go stop her.

553
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,900
That's not good enough,
by a mile.

554
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:18,001
I know. Believe me.
But --

555
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:19,036
can we talk
about this later?

556
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:21,505
Hey.

557
00:29:21,572 --> 00:29:23,457
How you holding up?

558
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:24,708
Been better.

559
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:26,743
Listen, if you need
for us to leave --

560
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:27,961
I need you guys to leave.

561
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:29,246
Okay, we will.

562
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:30,681
It's just that...

563
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:31,965
Look -- Margaret
is still out there.

564
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:37,187
What do you guys
need to know?

565
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:38,755
Is there anything
that stood out?

566
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,395
Well, um...

567
00:29:44,446 --> 00:29:46,413
She barely gave a crap
about me.

568
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:48,198
I mean,
I was just in the way.

569
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:50,367
She was all about
getting Camille.

570
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:52,602
- Okay. That's something.
- One other thing.

571
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:54,872
Um...She enjoyed it.

572
00:29:56,207 --> 00:29:57,708
She was smiling.

573
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:07,885
I feel naked
doing this in daylight.

574
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:09,286
Yeah.
Let's just hurry up.

575
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:28,605
All right, mags.

576
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:30,824
My lighter's juiced
this time.

577
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:38,999
Geraldo'd.

578
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,000
Not good.

579
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:41,452
Never good.

580
00:30:41,503 --> 00:30:43,454
Dean, if someone knew enough
to take Margaret's bones,

581
00:30:43,505 --> 00:30:44,621
they're not
kidding around.

582
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:46,540
That's serious
binding magic.

583
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,426
Great.

584
00:30:49,494 --> 00:30:51,378
Psychic ghost bitch
on a leash.

585
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:52,713
We got to find
those bones.

586
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:54,014
So we got to find
the bonehead.

587
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:56,683
So, what?

588
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,968
We call Bobby,
see what it takes

589
00:30:58,019 --> 00:30:59,586
to harness
the power of a ghost?

590
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:00,521
Yeah.

591
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:07,144
Hey, Sam, you know why
I'm not going to spend my money

592
00:31:07,195 --> 00:31:09,313
at the annual
Lily Dale E.S.P. Festival

593
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:11,231
and hot-dog-eating
contest this year?

594
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:13,233
Can't imagine.

595
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:15,352
Because all the headliners
are dead.

596
00:31:22,877 --> 00:31:26,880
You know, after Nikolai...

597
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:28,999
They asked Camille
to take his spot.

598
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,202
I mean,
she's so popular.

599
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:33,537
<i>Was</i> so popular.

600
00:31:33,588 --> 00:31:35,722
Okay, all these people --
would you say that they're

601
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,674
the, uh, you know,
top dogs in town?

602
00:31:37,725 --> 00:31:39,376
Well, it's not really
like that.

603
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:41,895
But they were all doing well.
I mean, your grandma?

604
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,347
She wrote a few books.

605
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:46,266
Yeah, and Imelda was on
"the Nate Berkus Show" twice,

606
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:48,752
so, yeah, I guess
they were doing pretty well.

607
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,188
You think that's why
she went after them?

608
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:53,073
I mean,
if you had to guess,

609
00:31:53,157 --> 00:31:55,492
who do you think
would be next in line?

610
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,528
I mean, I don't know.

611
00:31:57,579 --> 00:31:59,613
Well, your grandma
was headlining at the big hall,

612
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:01,865
so who do you think they would
ask to fill in for her?

613
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:04,001
Probably...

614
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:06,753
...Me.

615
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:11,592
Hey.

616
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:13,093
Agent.
Are you here with my check?

617
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:15,412
I'm looking for someone
who bought some things from you.

618
00:32:15,463 --> 00:32:16,597
How do you know from me?

619
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:17,948
I'm kind of doubting

620
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,850
they sell ash-wood altars
at the Gas 'n Sip.

621
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,251
Valid.

622
00:32:21,302 --> 00:32:23,103
Let me see the list.

623
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:32,696
Ah. Here we go.
Credit-card receipt.

624
00:32:32,763 --> 00:32:34,565
I assume you want
the address?

625
00:32:34,616 --> 00:32:36,233
That would be great.
Thanks.

626
00:32:36,284 --> 00:32:37,985
It's the least I can do.

627
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,104
I just heard about
Camille Thibideaux.

628
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:43,624
Thanks a lot.

629
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:47,711
You're welcome.

630
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:56,453
Are you sure
that'll work?

631
00:32:57,338 --> 00:32:59,056
That should hold her off
long enough

632
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,891
for Sam to find the bones
and burn them.

633
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,225
Hopefully.

634
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:03,560
Hopefully?

635
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:05,846
Does it hurt 'em?

636
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,297
Burning their bones?

637
00:33:09,684 --> 00:33:10,867
I never really
thought about it.

638
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:13,803
Probably, yeah.

639
00:33:13,855 --> 00:33:15,355
Good.

640
00:33:27,535 --> 00:33:29,152
Where's the altar?!

641
00:33:29,203 --> 00:33:30,837
It's there!

642
00:33:36,994 --> 00:33:37,961
You're...

643
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:39,713
not a necromancer.

644
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:42,716
This is a lamaze class,
I swear.

645
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,051
I-I believe you.

646
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:44,935
Sorry.

647
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:52,643
Om...

648
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:54,728
- Dean, it's the pawn-shop guy.
- How do you know?

649
00:33:54,812 --> 00:33:57,064
He goose-chased me to
a friggin' pregnant yoga class.

650
00:33:57,148 --> 00:33:59,683
All right, well, figure out
where he put her bones.

651
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:00,850
I will.

652
00:34:00,902 --> 00:34:02,202
Fast, Sam.

653
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:03,413
Somehow, I just knew
you'd be back.

654
00:35:11,886 --> 00:35:13,886
Hi, Agent.

655
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:15,580
<i>Put the skull down.</i>

656
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:17,364
Okay, okay.
Take it easy. Here.

657
00:35:20,824 --> 00:35:22,208
All right.
That's enough.

658
00:35:23,794 --> 00:35:25,544
- Is she gone?
- I doubt it.

659
00:35:25,612 --> 00:35:28,214
But she can't get past
the line, right?

660
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:29,131
Right.

661
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,220
Nice binding spell.

662
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:35,304
It doesn't matter.

663
00:35:36,807 --> 00:35:38,957
She helps me
because she wants to.

664
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:39,625
What?

665
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:44,313
Oh. Damn it.
I hate when they do that.

666
00:35:44,398 --> 00:35:46,298
Get the salt. Go.

667
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:49,402
Dean!

668
00:35:53,973 --> 00:35:56,642
Margaret and me
are the same.

669
00:35:57,644 --> 00:35:59,328
We're the real thing.

670
00:35:59,413 --> 00:36:01,280
But guess what --

671
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:03,649
sometimes the real thing

672
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,869
just isn't pretty
or entertaining enough.

673
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,059
When I show people what I'm
capable of, it scares them.

674
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:15,594
I can't pay my rent!

675
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:22,000
Get behind me.

676
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:24,169
That's as far
as you go, bitch.

677
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:26,305
Margaret's happy
to kill for me.

678
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:28,024
She likes the leash.

679
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:29,392
You're sick.

680
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:31,560
You know what else I am?

681
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:32,945
A real psychic,
you dick-bag.

682
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:37,450
Surprise.

683
00:36:44,157 --> 00:36:45,408
Aw.

684
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:48,026
Sorry, handsome.

685
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:51,697
Where are
the rest of the bones?

686
00:37:04,511 --> 00:37:06,762
These people
don't deserve to die.

687
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:09,315
Oh, come on!
Are you kidding me?

688
00:37:09,382 --> 00:37:11,901
I live in squalor 'cause I can't
put on a show like them?

689
00:37:11,985 --> 00:37:13,069
Don't do this.

690
00:37:14,438 --> 00:37:15,821
- They're in the bedroom, aren't they?
- No.

691
00:37:20,277 --> 00:37:21,327
You're not
getting in there.

692
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:36,959
Dean!

693
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,082
Too bad.

694
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:48,771
Dean.

695
00:38:13,147 --> 00:38:15,002
In the bed?

696
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:16,370
They were <i>in</i> the bed?

697
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:17,671
Yeah.

698
00:38:17,723 --> 00:38:19,390
Ugh. I can't believe
he was <i>boning</i> her.

699
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:20,841
Dean.

700
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:22,343
Can I get you
anything else?

701
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:24,095
Uh, just a refill.

702
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:26,380
And if you affirmate me,
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

703
00:38:30,152 --> 00:38:34,388
All righty then.
Coffee, coming up.

704
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:37,324
I can't wait to get out
of this frickin' fortune cookie.

705
00:38:37,392 --> 00:38:39,110
Dean.

706
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:43,781
I'm gonna go, um...

707
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:45,583
Do something outside.

708
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,034
Okay.

709
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:50,871
- Hi. Have a seat.
- Hi.

710
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:52,123
Oh, thank you.

711
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:53,124
Yeah.

712
00:38:54,576 --> 00:38:56,577
You didn't stick around
so I could say thank you.

713
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:58,863
No reason to thank me.

714
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,881
You saved my life.

715
00:39:00,932 --> 00:39:02,933
Yeah, but not
your friend's.

716
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:04,101
Well...

717
00:39:04,186 --> 00:39:06,053
you didn't
send that ghost, so...

718
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:07,805
Thank you
for coming to kill it.

719
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,394
You and Sam
seem a little better.

720
00:39:13,445 --> 00:39:15,762
You could tell that
from the walk up?

721
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:17,481
Take it or leave it.

722
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:21,452
Also guessing you're not so keen
to come visit here again,

723
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:23,437
so...this is goodbye.

724
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,875
Wish we'd met
on a better week.

725
00:39:27,942 --> 00:39:29,493
I wish I had
better weeks.

726
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:30,578
Hm.

727
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:32,496
But, uh, hey.
You never know.

728
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:35,216
It's not like
you can tell the future, right?

729
00:39:35,283 --> 00:39:36,133
Hmm.

730
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:42,223
Well, answer's hazy.

731
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,308
Try again later.

732
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:46,477
Right.

733
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,301
- Hey.
- Hey.

734
00:39:55,737 --> 00:39:57,104
That's your stuff.

735
00:39:57,155 --> 00:39:59,657
Yeah. Yeah.
I figured we'd take one car.

736
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:04,612
Works for me.
You still want to break my face?

737
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:08,082
No.
Uh, not at this moment.

738
00:40:08,149 --> 00:40:09,816
Look, you know what?

739
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:11,836
Um...

740
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,153
You were right.

741
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:14,922
About Amy.

742
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,757
If she was...

743
00:40:16,824 --> 00:40:18,125
just any monster,

744
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,095
I'm not sure I could have
let her walk away.

745
00:40:21,162 --> 00:40:23,130
I don't know.
I mean, I'll never know.

746
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:24,465
So, what are you saying?

747
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:26,133
What I'm saying is...

748
00:40:26,184 --> 00:40:27,852
I get why you did it.

749
00:40:27,936 --> 00:40:30,437
You were just trying to
make sure no one else got hurt.

750
00:40:30,505 --> 00:40:31,689
But here's the thing.

751
00:40:31,773 --> 00:40:33,440
You can't just
look me in the face

752
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:34,841
and tell me you're fine.

753
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:37,228
I mean, you're not sleeping,
you drink for the record --

754
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:38,729
Oh, here we go.

755
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:40,948
Look, whatever.
Last one to preach. I know.

756
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:42,533
But...
Just be honest with me.

757
00:40:42,617 --> 00:40:44,118
How are those
the actions of someone

758
00:40:44,185 --> 00:40:45,653
who knows
they did the right thing?

759
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:47,020
- You want me to be honest?
- Yeah.

760
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:48,706
I went with my gut.

761
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,524
And that felt right.

762
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:53,026
I didn't trust her, Sam.

763
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:54,528
Of course,
ever since Cass,

764
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:56,363
I'm having a hard time
trusting anybody.

765
00:40:58,149 --> 00:41:01,835
And as far
as how I been acting...

766
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:03,170
I don't know.

767
00:41:03,221 --> 00:41:05,306
Maybe it's 'cause
I don't like lying to you.

768
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:08,008
You know,
it doesn't feel right.

769
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:10,761
So, yeah, you got me there.
I been climbing the walls.

770
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:12,096
I know how that is.

771
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,984
But, hey...

772
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:19,386
If I learned one thing
from that museum,

773
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:20,988
sibling acts are tough.

774
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:23,691
Oh, don't compare us
to that hall of crazy.

775
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:26,076
We're like poster kids
of functional family life

776
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:27,111
compared to them.

777
00:41:27,195 --> 00:41:29,163
- It's a low bar.
- Well, hey... grading on a

778
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,165
curve has got me past everything
since kindergarten,

779
00:41:31,232 --> 00:41:32,499
so don't knock it.

780
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:33,701
Whatever you say.

781
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:40,457
I still want to know
how that guy bent my spoon.

782
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:44,378
Forget it, Sam.
It's Lily Dale.

783
