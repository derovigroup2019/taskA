1
00:00:02,631 --> 00:00:04,365
We think it may have been
an Alpha.

2
00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:06,500
An Alpha, like...?
Like all monsters come from somewhere.

3
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:08,052
Bag me a live Alpha.

4
00:00:08,086 --> 00:00:10,371
The first of your species.
The very first.

5
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:12,840
Prison full of monsters --
can't just leave them,

6
00:00:12,874 --> 00:00:14,842
can't let them go.
I understand.

7
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:16,761
Geothrive is part
of Roman Enterprises.

8
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:18,346
Dick's funding
an archaeological dig...

9
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,897
Factory in Saudi Arabia...
Fishery in Jakarta...

10
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:21,932
A research center --
it's everywhere.

11
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,068
It's all tied together,
Dean.

12
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:26,687
He's not in control.

13
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:28,039
That was
vengeful-spirit crap.

14
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:29,824
But it's still Bobby.

15
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:33,361
Well,
what the hell are you?

16
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:35,562
I'm a...
K-Kevin Tran.

17
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,581
I'm in advanced placement.

18
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:38,699
He's a Prophet
of the Lord.

19
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:39,834
And that's the word of God?

20
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:41,118
One of them, yes.

21
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:43,120
- Well, what's it say, then?
- It's about Leviathan.

22
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:45,756
Does it say anything
about how to kill them?

23
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,241
Leviathan cannot be slain

24
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,393
but by a bone
of a righteous mortal

25
00:00:49,428 --> 00:00:51,128
washed in the three bloods
of the fallen.

26
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:53,564
It says we need to start with
the blood of a fallen angel.

27
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:57,601
Always happy to bleed
for the Winchesters.

28
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:00,805
Hello, Kevin.

29
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:08,229
Thanks, Phil.

30
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:10,481
And now we turn our attention
to agriculture,

31
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:13,134
where an unlikely personality
has now come on to the scene

32
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:14,335
in a major way.

33
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,603
<i>Richard Roman,</i>
<i>a C.E.O. whose company</i>

34
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:19,156
<i>dominates the defense</i>
<i>and aviation sectors,</i>

35
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:20,774
<i>not to mention being a giant</i>

36
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,960
<i>in the motivational-speaking</i>
<i>world.</i>

37
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:25,463
<i>What can I say, Gloria?</i>
<i>I'm a multitasker.</i>

38
00:01:25,497 --> 00:01:26,681
Clearly.

39
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:29,300
And now you've recently
purchased controlling stock

40
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:30,768
in Sucrocorp --

41
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:32,319
among the world's
leading manufacturers

42
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:33,504
in high-fructose
corn syrup.

43
00:01:33,538 --> 00:01:35,890
It's a pleasure to have you
with us, Richard.

44
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:36,974
Please. "Dick."

45
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:38,092
So, tell us, Dick,

46
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:40,678
why the recent fascination
with big foods?

47
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:42,947
Well, it's no secret
we all love to eat,

48
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:46,283
but now Sucrocorp will focus
on eating well.

49
00:01:46,318 --> 00:01:47,852
Help me connect the dots.

50
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:50,637
How will pumping sweeteners
into our system

51
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:51,822
make us healthier?

52
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:53,107
One word -- purity.

53
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:54,909
<i>We're dialing back</i>
<i>the additives</i>

54
00:01:54,943 --> 00:01:57,495

<i>all-American product</i>

55
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:58,529
<i>you people deserve.</i>

56
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,798
<i>America</i>
<i>is for go-getters,</i>

57
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,534
<i>folks who get off their butts</i>
<i>and make it happen.</i>

58
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:06,137
<i>And we need you just</i>
<i>as healthy as you can be.</i>

59
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,005
<i>Which is why we are diving</i>
<i>whole hog</i>

60
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,124
<i>into what keeps Americans</i>
<i>living longer...</i>

61
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:11,609
and tasting better.

62
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:12,993
You do, of course,
mean to say

63
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:14,428
the <i>food</i>
<i>will be tasting better.</i>

64
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:17,932
That's exactly what I mean.

67
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,352
Your 11:00 a.m. is waiting
in the conference room.

68
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,020
Thank you, Susan.

69
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,463
Susan...

70
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:52,183
Are we still looking
for a rep in Mainstream Media?

71
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:54,218
- Yes, we are.
- Wunderbar.

72
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:55,986
Put a "replace order"
on Gloria there.

73
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,076
And with the corpse?

74
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,094
Call Chef Fieri.

75
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:06,313
I feel like barbecue.

76
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:16,657
Kevin. Dick.

77
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:19,660
I'm <i>very</i> excited
to meet you.

78
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,581
You nervous?

79
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:24,915
Don't be.

80
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,251
I'm your biggest fan.

81
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:31,338
I brought you a present.

82
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:41,699
What's that say, Kev?

83
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,567
I don't know.

84
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:45,736
Cute.

85
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,104
Edgar?

86
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:56,547
Easy, Edgar.
Don't scare the boy.

87
00:04:02,988 --> 00:04:05,089
You know, I've checked,
Kevin.

88
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:06,407
Number one in your class,

89
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:08,492
winner of the Chad Kennedy
top young scientist prize --

90
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:10,294
all that on top of being
Keeper of the Word.

91
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:13,497
You're a clever
young man.

92
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:17,801
I'm confident you'll make
the right choice here.

93
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:22,273
But I see this is
a negotiation.

94
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:26,126
Well, I will sweeten...
the pot.

95
00:04:27,646 --> 00:04:30,464
What is it?

96
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:33,601
My sources tell me
you're applying to Princeton.

97
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:37,021
Letter of recommendation
like that from a man like me --

98
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:38,939
done.

99
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:48,165
I can't do it.

100
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,718
I admire
your gumption, kid.

101
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:53,654
But I still think there's
some wiggle room here.

102
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:55,122
I tell you what --

103
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:56,774
let's kick it up a notch.

104
00:04:56,808 --> 00:04:59,310
See if I can't
change your mind.

105
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:02,346
Edgar,
that live feed up yet?

106
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,682
Of course.

107
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:10,988
Ma?

108
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:12,056
Mom?!

109
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:15,526
Well, I think this negotiation
is concluded.

110
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:19,880
You drive
a hard bargain, kid.

111
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:31,241
Okay, man, I have read this
more times

112
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:33,744
than the <i>Playboy</i> I found
in dad's duffel.

113
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,846
Anna Nicole?

114
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:38,899
Anna Nicole.

115
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:41,251
Oh, the good --
they die young, huh?

116
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:45,205
Look, we can read this
till our eyes bleed.

117
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:46,840
This ain't getting
any clearer.

118
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:49,109
Okay.
Then what does it mean?

119
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:51,929
Uh

120
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,515
Cut off the head,
and the body will flounder.

121
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:56,066
- Yeah.
- Okay.

122
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:59,019
Well, I think we both agree
that the head is Dick. Right?

123
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:00,270
Right.

124
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:02,356
So, bottom line is,
we go grab the stuff,

125
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,857
and we mix ourselves
a weapon.

126
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:04,942
End of story.

127
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:06,527
Look, I'm all
for killing Dick.

128
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:07,761
I'm just saying,
what then?

129
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:09,129
I mean, what about the rest
of the Leviathan?

130
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:11,432
What, are they gonna
just...drop dead?

131
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:13,200
I don't know.
Maybe.

132
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:14,568
Maybe?

133
00:06:14,586 --> 00:06:16,337
"Maybe" is good enough
for you right now?

134
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:18,589
- One problem at a time, all right?
- Okay.

135
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,707
But it's not a crazy idea

136
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:21,008
to try and figure out
what the catch is

137
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,259
before we go crashing
the gate.

138
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:23,711
Maybe this <i>is</i> the catch.

139
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:25,379
God's not telling us
every detail.

140
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:27,047
You know?

141
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:28,465
The word <i>is</i> from God.

142
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:31,218
I don't know how much better
it's gonna get.

143
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:54,124
Hey, Bobby.

144
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,994
How you feeling?

145
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:58,295
Stronger than ever.

146
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,631
Now, while you two
have been chasing your tails,

147
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:02,599
I've been thinking
on that weapon.

148
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:04,418
Wait a second. Don't you think you
should be saving your strength?

149
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:06,020
For what?

150
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:07,304
I'm just saying you might want
to slow down. You don't look so hot.

151
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:08,272
I'm in the veil.

152
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:09,990
My Brad Pitt days
are over.

153
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:12,292
Now, the kid says

154
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,811
that the only way
to kill Leviathan

155
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:16,146
is with a bone washed in the
three bloods of the fallen.

156
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:19,183
It's got to be from a human
as light and good

157
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:21,752
as the Leviathan are hungry
and dark.

158
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:23,487
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

159
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:26,139
The rest is doable,
and doable now.

160
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:29,109
You've already got
the fallen angel blood.

161
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:30,861
Now, next up is blood
from the ruler

162
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:32,029
of fallen humanity.

163
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,847
Now, the best I can tell,
that's Crowley.

164
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:37,468
Numero tres is the father
of fallen beasts.

165
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:38,452
Which means...?

166
00:07:38,486 --> 00:07:39,686
You got to bleed an Alpha.

167
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,038
But they're all dead.

168
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,123
I mean, every one we found,
we rounded up for Crowley,

169
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:44,708
and then Cass
whammied them all.

170
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,493
Well, then, make this
Cass' problem, too.

171
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:49,046
Cass ain't exactly in the
problem-solving mode, Bobby.

172
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:50,314
Then Crowley!

173
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:52,132
All right, I get it.
I get it.

174
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:52,800
Do you?!

175
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:02,810
I'm just sayin'.

176
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:05,295
I have faith that you boys
will figure it out.

177
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:10,717
Relax. I'm fine.

178
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:14,354
Just got a little
carried away.

179
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:19,526
<i>Here at Sucrocorp,</i>

180
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:23,430
<i>your well-being is</i>
<i>our number-one priority.</i>

181
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:29,870
<i>Sucrocorp...</i>

182
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:31,305
Little F.Y.I.

183
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,641
Bobby's officing out of the John
these days.

184
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:36,894
Uh...awkward.

185
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,712
Yeah, you're telling me.

186
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,681
He does have some ideas
about the weapon, though.

187
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:42,916
- Really?
- Yeah.

188
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:46,186
Well, uh, he may be
just in time.

189
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:51,175
"Roman acquires..."
What's Sucrocorp?

190
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,526
They make food additives,

191
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,411
namely high-fructose
corn syrup.

192
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:57,915
That crap is in -- well, it's in
just about everything --

193
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:00,217
um, soda, sauces, bread.

194
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:01,051
Don't say "pie."

195
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:02,102
Definitely pie.

196
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,254
Bastards.

197
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:05,305
So now what?

198
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,374
Roman's moved past
restaurants?

199
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:10,594
And into grocery stores,
Gas n' Sips, vending machines.

200
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:12,529
What can we do about it?

201
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:14,448
Short of going Al Qaeda
on their trucks and plants,

202
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:15,849
there's nothing we <i>can</i> do
about it.

203
00:09:19,387 --> 00:09:23,273
Like I said, uh,
Bobby's got some ideas.

204
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:27,060
<i>Et ad congregandum</i>
<i>eos coram me.</i>

205
00:09:29,814 --> 00:09:30,931
Hello, boys.

206
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:43,961
That's some bracing prose you're
putting down there, Kevin.

207
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:47,698
You all done?

208
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:53,587
You've done well. Princeton
will be lucky to have you.

209
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,657
What about my mom?

210
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:58,792
Make the call.

211
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:04,097
Release her.

212
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:07,067
But stress the consequences
of talking.

213
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:09,653
Kevin, I'm gonna request
the pleasure of your company

214
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:10,854
a tad longer.

215
00:10:10,905 --> 00:10:12,189
You, on the other hand,

216
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,807
I need to drop in
on an old friend.

217
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:19,145
So, that's what all
the "rumble, rumble" was about.

218
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:21,147
Who translated it for you?

219
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:22,983
Never mind. You gonna give us
the blood or not?

220
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:25,235
Happily.

221
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:28,372
But not quite yet.

222
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:29,656
I'm all for chopping Dick,

223
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:31,491
but I can't have you
running around

224
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:33,343
with a vial of my blood,
now, can I?

225
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:36,213
You know the sheer number
of nefarious spells

226
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:38,482
my enemies can use
that blood for?

227
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:41,134
- Well, then when?
- Last.

228
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:44,838
After you've got
all the other components.

229
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:48,792
Most difficult, the angel part,
I'm assuming.

230
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:54,347
Given your role
in their little apocalypse,

231
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:56,349
I can't imagine
the choirboys upstairs

232
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:59,319
are wetting their vestments
to do you -- what's the word? --

233
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:00,587
a solid...

234
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:03,907
Unless, of course, you have
an angel up your sleeve.

235
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,810
Well, that'd be convenient,
but, uh, no.

236
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,579
Don't worry about it.

237
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:10,881
We'll get the angel blood
one way or another.

238
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:12,749
We just need you to be ready
next time we call.

239
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,167
Fine.

240
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,186
Oh, here's a tip.

241
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,171
I have it on good authority

242
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:21,358
there's one Alpha
still among us.

243
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:23,760
Whose authority?

244
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:24,845
Mine.

245
00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:27,380
Wily character,
that Alpha vampire.

246
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:29,149
Somehow made good
his prison break

247
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:31,101
before Cass went nuclear
on the place.

248
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:31,902
And you know this how?

249
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:34,371
Keep your friends close,

250
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:35,956
your enemies, blah blah.

251
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,424
Needless to say,
I keep tabs.

252
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,677
He moves around quite a bit.

253
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:42,763
But I have an inkling

254
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:45,248
I know where to start
the Easter-egg hunt.

255
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:47,951
Happy trails.

256
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:51,705
Okay.
Where, jackass?!

257
00:11:58,546 --> 00:12:02,015
Hoople, North Dakota.

258
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,134
Piece of paper
would have worked.

259
00:12:15,947 --> 00:12:16,947
Hey.

260
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,330
He seem angry?

261
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:34,798
Angry?
Of course he's angry.

262
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:36,550
If you were Bobby,
wouldn't you be?

263
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:38,301
But was he showing signs
of fatigue,

264
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:39,386
like -- like fritzing?

265
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,254
No, actually,
it was just the opposite.

266
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:42,923
He said he never
felt stronger.

267
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:45,792
That's what
I was afraid of.

268
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,261
The stronger he gets,

269
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:50,564
the closer he comes to going
full vengeful spirit.

270
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:51,848
That's reality.

271
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,817
We need to talk about
what we're going to do with him.

272
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:55,402
- Do with him?
- Yeah.

273
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:57,470
Three weeks ago, you were
talking how this could work.

274
00:12:57,488 --> 00:12:59,189
And now you want to go Kevorkian
on his ass?

275
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,640
I'm just saying
that the lore

276
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:02,475
doesn't have a single
real-life example

277
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:04,194
of Casper
the friendly ghost.

278
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:07,414
It's all basically poltergeists
until a hunter comes along...

279
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:09,032
Yeah, well,
the lore sucks.

280
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,034
I'm talking pure hatred,
Dean.

281
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:12,702
No humanity.

282
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:14,788
I mean, he could...kill...

283
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:17,007
possess people.

284
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,842
I mean, Bobby could burn
this friggin' building down.

285
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:20,627
Look, if he goes off the rails --
Hey.

286
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:21,845
What?

287
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,113
Check out that guy
over there.

288
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:26,266
He seem a little
out of it to you?

289
00:13:28,302 --> 00:13:29,686
I-I don't know.
Maybe.

290
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:36,960
What about Paula Deen
over here?

291
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,036
Yeah, they --
they look like...

292
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:50,023
...like those
Turducken people.

293
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:55,545
It's starting.

294
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:58,548
It's the corn syrup.

295
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,901
Everything in the store
is laced with it.

296
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:03,870
Everything?

297
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:11,478
Hey, man, I'm gonna go
into toxic shock, okay?

298
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:13,530
I-I...I need my road food.

299
00:14:13,564 --> 00:14:15,348
That's what Roman
is banking on.

300
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:17,150
Hey.

301
00:14:17,185 --> 00:14:18,685
Hey.

302
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,238
This one says "natural."
T-that means it's safe. Right?

303
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:24,241
I hate to break it to you,

304
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:26,243
but corn syrup <i>is</i> natural,
technically.

305
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:28,862
Well, then what the hell
are we supposed to eat?

306
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:41,791
It's totally dark.
I can't see inside.

307
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:44,444
Well, should we wait
for daylight?

308
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,363
Hell no,
we're not waiting.

309
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:47,514
I'll scout it.

310
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:49,449
See if we need to bring in
the big guns.

311
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:51,551
I don't know.
Look, Bobby...

312
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:07,534
Okay.

313
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:08,735
Place is clear.

314
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:11,304
But there's something
you're gonna want to see.

315
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:24,634
Careful.

316
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:51,005
You know a way to kill vamps
with battery acid?

317
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,458
Only way I know
is beheading.

318
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:56,443
Well, something
didn't agree with them.

319
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,631
Hey.

320
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:03,567
Check out that wall.

321
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,486
Something seem weird
to you?

322
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:13,427
Yeah, see if you can find a switch
or a lever or something.

323
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:17,614
Don't need one.

324
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:30,494
Hey.

325
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:47,344
Dean. Machete.

326
00:16:47,378 --> 00:16:48,629
Hey.

327
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:51,014
Look.
We're not gonna hurt you.

328
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:52,800
Okay? No fangs.

329
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,051
See?

330
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:55,369
We just want to talk.

331
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:57,888
I was 8.

332
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,992
My mom left me at the playground
while she ran to the store.

333
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:06,230
A man approached me

334
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:08,766
and said I was
the prettiest girl there.

335
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,952
And I've been living
with these...

336
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:15,589
things...ever since.

337
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:18,692
At least until now.

338
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:20,694
Do you have any idea why?

339
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:24,014
I'm one of
his special girls.

340
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:27,868
All the others,
it was their job

341
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:29,303
to make sure I was ready
for the Alpha,

342
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:30,370
whenever he came.

343
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:31,588
Wash me...

344
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:33,874
give me my I.V. bags
every day.

345
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,978
It's my only food.

346
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:40,230
So my blood's pure.

347
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:42,900
They've been doing this
for, what, 12 years?

348
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:46,120
Virgins are a delicacy.

349
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:49,189
He always has
at least one of us on hand.

350
00:17:49,223 --> 00:17:51,508
Well, don't worry, okay?

351
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:53,059
We're gonna get you back
to your mother.

352
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:54,578
Think she remembers me?

353
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:55,863
Of course she does.

354
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:58,448
Don't you remember her?

355
00:18:02,637 --> 00:18:04,571
These, uh...

356
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,924
these guys --
they, uh, friends of yours?

357
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,775
They take care of the Alpha
when he's here.

358
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,893
Or <i>did.</i>

359
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:10,961
What happened to them?

360
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:12,796
A week ago,
they came back

361
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:15,215
from what they said
was an easy hunt.

362
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,568
Three humans just came,

363
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:19,186
didn't put up any fight.

364
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,155
But when they started
on them,

365
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:23,590
the vampires screamed
in pain.

366
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:27,311
The ones who ate
died immediately.

367
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:28,462
And the ones who didn't?

368
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:29,696
There was only one.

369
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:32,316
When he saw what happened,
he moved to animals.

370
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:34,201
He's out hunting
as we speak.

371
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,921
Never heard of vamps
being allergic to humans before.

372
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:39,857
You think maybe
it's the corn syrup?

373
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:41,124
I mean, think about it.

374
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:43,343
The Gas n' Sip was lousy
with stoners.

375
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:44,628
All ripe for the picking.

376
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:46,430
She did say
it was an easy hunt.

377
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:48,448
Do you know where
the Alpha is now?

378
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:51,084
I don't know.
Maybe.

379
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:53,453
He has a place he goes
when something's wrong.

380
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:54,738
He calls it his retreat.

381
00:18:59,928 --> 00:19:00,961
What is that?

382
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,049
That's, uh,
that's Sam's douche tracker.

383
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:09,319
Helps us find the Alpha.

384
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:10,921
All we need's an address.

385
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:13,640
I don't know.

386
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:15,792
But I remember things
that maybe can help.

387
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:20,247
That's okay.
Just do the best you can.

388
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:46,052
Finally.

389
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:48,955
I'd run out of magazines.

390
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:51,558
Quick question.
Where's your boss?

391
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,314
Let's try that again.

392
00:19:57,348 --> 00:19:59,132
- Where is he?
- Go to hell.

393
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,252
No. My neighborhood
is worse than that.

394
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:10,310
<i>Missoula, Montana.</i>

395
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:11,445
Was that so hard?

396
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,001
I can't do this, man.

397
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:20,070
I can't live
on rabbit food.

398
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:21,538
I'm -- I'm a warrior.

399
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:22,989
Dean, you'll be fine.

400
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:24,041
You don't know that.

401
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:26,826
So what's next
on the list?

402
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:28,678
Well, if we're bum-rushing
the Alpha,

403
00:20:28,713 --> 00:20:30,597
then we're gonna need
dead man's blood,

404
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:31,631
which means a morgue.

405
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:32,999
Or...

406
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:35,102
Or what?

407
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:40,857
Dude, forget the morgue.

408
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:44,361
We are swimming
in vamp poison.

409
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,614
Excuse me, sir.
Hi.

410
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:49,849
We, uh,
we're with the...

411
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:50,951
Red Cross?

412
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:53,503
See, we have
an emergency shortage.

413
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:56,189
And we're gonna need
you to...

414
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:59,659
You're not getting a word
I'm saying, are you?

415
00:21:01,362 --> 00:21:02,529
Hey.

416
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:05,198
Hold out your arm.
We need your blood.

417
00:21:05,216 --> 00:21:06,166
Dude.

418
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:10,087
All right, Sam.

419
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:12,422
Tap the keg.

420
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:13,507
Here?

421
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,208
Yeah, Sam, look around.

422
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:17,277
It's friggin' Woodstock. Everybody's
hopped up on the brown acid.

423
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:18,545
We don't need
the song and dance.

424
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:19,813
Give him a little prick.

425
00:21:36,414 --> 00:21:36,446
That hurts.

426
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,702
This is for Hurricane Katrina,
you said?

427
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:43,720
Yes.

428
00:21:43,754 --> 00:21:44,704
Yes, I did.

429
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,758
So, look...

430
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:51,128
When we get there...

431
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:52,712
Yeah?

432
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:59,085
Bobby's gonna have
to hang back.

433
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:01,721
Do you disagree?

434
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:02,755
He ain't gonna like it.

435
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:04,057
I mean, he helped us
in getting Emily.

436
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,609
Look, I'm team Bobby, too.
Okay?

437
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:08,111
But there's a reason we left him
in the car with Emily. You know that.

438
00:22:08,146 --> 00:22:09,479
The more action he sees,

439
00:22:09,514 --> 00:22:11,598
the more chance he gets
to spin out.

440
00:22:11,616 --> 00:22:12,816
All right, fine.

441
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:15,702
So, we'll keep him
off the front lines,

442
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:19,606
and he can just, you know,
keep calm and carry on, right?

443
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:21,074
And if he can't?

444
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:26,296
[ War's "Why Can't We Be
Friends?" Plays ]

445
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,115
? Why can't we be friends? ?

446
00:22:31,302 --> 00:22:34,287
? Why can't we be friends? ?

447
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,960
When they hauled you off
to vamp camp,

448
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:42,512
do you remember how long
the drive was?

449
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:44,431
We left at night.

450
00:22:44,465 --> 00:22:46,516
Got in before dawn.

451
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,319
So, six, seven hours?

452
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:51,638
I think so, yes.

453
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:53,740
Do you remember
any highways?

454
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:55,408
No. We only
took back roads.

455
00:22:55,443 --> 00:22:58,111
Okay. So, figure they averaged
45 miles per --

456
00:22:58,145 --> 00:22:59,779
Couldn't have been more
than 300 miles.

457
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:00,864
Right.

458
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:02,115
What direction
were you going?

459
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,501
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

460
00:23:04,535 --> 00:23:06,036
Oh, it's okay.
Em, you're doing great.

461
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:10,707
Um...is there anything else
you remember?

462
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:12,158
Bells.

463
00:23:12,176 --> 00:23:16,263
As we pulled up,
I heard these loud bells.

464
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:18,381
It was still dark out?
You thinking church?

465
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:19,683
No, that's too early.

466
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:21,384
It could have been
a monastery.

467
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:23,220
Monks get up at 4:00 a.m.
to pray.

468
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:26,273
Ugh. Can't get laid.
Can't sleep in.

469
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:27,691
A friggin' tragedy.

470
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:32,646
Okay, so, Alpha's camping
next to a, uh, monkey house.

471
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:36,566
How many do we got
in range?

472
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:39,119
Looks like one.

473
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:40,620
Just outside...

474
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,166
This is where he took me.

475
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,720
Are you sure?

476
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,223
What now?

477
00:24:00,258 --> 00:24:02,041
We'll get you
someplace safe.

478
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,194

What's a Kardashian?

486
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,417
Oh, that's...

487
00:24:27,451 --> 00:24:28,852
just another bloodsucker.

488
00:24:31,422 --> 00:24:33,573
No, it --
it's...a joke.

489
00:24:35,593 --> 00:24:36,743
Here.

490
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:38,628

by dawn,

call this number,

You bet.

500
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,439
It was the wind.

Chill out, Bobby.
We'll be back soon.

Well, he didn't take <i>that</i>

he was gonna take it?

00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:25,642
Excuse me.

00:25:25,676 --> 00:25:27,477

No, I'm close by.

00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:36,713
But...

533
00:26:36,747 --> 00:26:38,798
Are you sure you just
want to charge in there,

534
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:39,916
machetes blazing?

535
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:41,134
Last time,
it took a dozen hunters

536
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:42,218
to take down the Alpha.

537
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:43,520
And most of them
didn't make it out.

538
00:26:43,554 --> 00:26:46,573
Yeah, well,
you got a better idea?

539
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:55,548
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

540
00:27:07,912 --> 00:27:09,012
Dean.

541
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:17,187
Maybe we're too late.

542
00:27:19,123 --> 00:27:20,540
Sam!

543
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:23,343
<i>You know,</i>
<i>where I'm from,</i>

544
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:25,462
<i>you have to bite and claw</i>
<i>your way to the top.</i>

545
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:27,797
<i>Once you get there,</i>
<i>trust me,</i>

546
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:30,433
<i>the view's incredible.</i>

547
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:34,804
Okay, Dean's birthday.

548
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:38,775
Sam's birthday.

549
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:47,133
Damn it!

550
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,258
Son of a bitch.

551
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:57,160
Everything okay in there?
<i>- My</i> birthday.

552
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:59,496
Hello?

553
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:06,419
I need your help.

554
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:07,587
Get away from me.

555
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:09,422
Listen,
I need out of here.

556
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:10,924
Please!

557
00:28:21,502 --> 00:28:23,803
Just need you a little while.

558
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:39,919
Just till I get the bastard.

559
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:54,000
The Winchesters.

560
00:28:55,352 --> 00:28:57,487
I'm intrigued.

561
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,724
Emily.

562
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:04,010
Hi, Sam.

563
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:06,963
Wow.

564
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:08,131
For a girl raised
in a basement,

565
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:09,365
you're a hell of an actress.

566
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,517
You were gonna hurt
my daddy.

567
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:12,535
Hmm.

568
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,686
Wow.

569
00:29:13,704 --> 00:29:16,139
You get a trophy
in Stockholm Syndrome.

570
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:18,908
I'm sorry to burst
your bubble, but...

571
00:29:18,943 --> 00:29:20,043
we <i>weren't.</i>

572
00:29:20,077 --> 00:29:22,078
Sam here had
a better idea.

573
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:24,480
We're here to talk.
That's it.

574
00:29:27,284 --> 00:29:31,504
Now that my guys have taken
your blades

575
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:34,207
and your syringes
of tainted blood.

576
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:35,608
Is that what you mean?

577
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:38,077
Well, we...

578
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:40,964
figured you might hold
a grudge.

579
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:42,448
And why would I?

580
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:45,268
Because you captured me,
tortured me,

581
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,537
sold me to
the king of Hell?

582
00:29:47,571 --> 00:29:50,690
That was more our grandpa.

583
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:58,164
Ugh.

584
00:30:00,284 --> 00:30:01,501
Thank you.

585
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:03,336
That was awesome.

586
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,873
I'm going to
peel off your faces

587
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:08,541
- and drink you slowly.
- Just listen.

588
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:10,109
You <i>need</i> us.

589
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:12,629
Oh, yes.
I am <i>thirsty!</i>

590
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,080
The plague!
We know what it is!

591
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:17,367
What do you know
about Leviathan?

592
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,721
A bit.

593
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:25,875
You know they're poisoning
the food supply?

594
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,243
Roman didn't mention that

595
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:29,112
when we met for dinner
last fall.

596
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:32,298
We made lots of plans.

597
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,601
We are on excellent terms,
he and I.

598
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:36,903
You sure about that?

599
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:39,539
Did he mention
that he was going to...

600
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:42,241
Maui wowie
the human population?

601
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,593
Oh, of course.

602
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:47,680
He said grabbing a snack
would be easier than ever.

603
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:50,633
He said you'd all live together,
didn't he?

604
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:53,987
You really believe him?

605
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,856
You think your children
are dying by accident?

606
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,108
There is pesticide
in the formula!

607
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:01,010
It suits you to think so.

608
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:02,879
You need me on your side.

609
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:06,432
Look, we're not the ones
burning from the inside out.

610
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:07,567
Think about it.

611
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,468
Whatever deal he made with you
was crap!

612
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:11,771
- Trust us!
- Why are you telling me this?

613
00:31:11,805 --> 00:31:13,489
Because we can stop Dick.

614
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:15,408
Stop all of it.
We just...

615
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:19,629
We need your blood --
for the weapon.

616
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:24,050
So now you want to prevent

617
00:31:24,084 --> 00:31:26,969
the extermination
of the vampire race.

618
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:28,604
No.

619
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:32,158
But it beats going down
with you.

620
00:31:34,094 --> 00:31:37,013
Allan, darling...

621
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:41,200
come.

622
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:47,840
Well, the creep
gets creepier.

623
00:31:47,858 --> 00:31:49,609
- What's wrong?
- Edgar's here.

624
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,201
Wow,
what a funny coincidence.

625
00:31:58,235 --> 00:32:00,369
All right, we need soap,
uh, cleanser,

626
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:01,821
anything with borax in it.

627
00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:02,872
We need knives.

628
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:04,373
Put them in the study.

629
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:05,458
Wait. No, no, no.

630
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:07,493
- No, wait.
- Word of advice, boys.

631
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:10,529
You do not live through
centuries of fire and ice

632
00:32:10,547 --> 00:32:12,698
and continental divide...

633
00:32:12,716 --> 00:32:15,401
by jumping to conclusions.

634
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:17,587
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

635
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:19,705
You're making a mistake!

636
00:32:19,723 --> 00:32:21,724
Listen! Wait!

637
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,343
Never hurts to get
the story first.

638
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:28,564
Hey. Hey!

639
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:43,463
Edgar.

640
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:46,232
I would've whipped you
up a meal.

641
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:50,586
Please, sit.

642
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:52,588
I'm dying to know
why you're here.

643
00:32:52,623 --> 00:32:55,224
I think you know.

644
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:57,310
And how is that?

645
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,096
I smell Sam
and Dean Winchester.

646
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,791
Anything?

647
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:16,460
Nothing.

648
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,378
You think Edgar's here
for the same reason we are?

649
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,796
I mean, look,
if they figured out

650
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,715
that we're here to get
Alpha blood for a weapon...

651
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,999
I think
any way you slice it,

652
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:24,384
you got Pac Man and True Blood
in the same room,

653
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,502
and that's bad news.

654
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,220
I mean, he's not stupid.

655
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,638
Why the hell do you think
he locked us in here?

656
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:29,856
Dean, we're his enemy.

657
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,176
I mean, they're like
monster cousins or something.

658
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:34,861
Who would you give the benefit
of the doubt to?

659
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:37,847
You know what? Maybe the Sucro
<i>is</i> poisoning the vamps on accident.

660
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:39,533
Maybe they'll fix it.

661
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:42,719
I think you got the oldest
monster on earth

662
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:46,156
thinking he can hold his own
because he always has.

663
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,526
Edgar's gonna
eat him alive.

664
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:50,877
Yeah.

665
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,381
Hey.

666
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,703
You think you could pick a lock
with this?

667
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,057
But, Dean...

668
00:34:04,091 --> 00:34:06,026
We gave up
all our vamptonite.

669
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,844
Did we?

670
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:17,003
Do you want the boys?

671
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:20,390
Yes?

672
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:23,743
You're welcome to them.

673
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:26,079
I'll have them sent out.

674
00:34:26,113 --> 00:34:27,797
How kind of you.

675
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,950
Oh, Edgar...

676
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,336
You do know why Sam and Dean
are here, don't you?

677
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:37,357
They insist that you're
exterminating us,

678
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:41,778
and I thought, well,
that's...impossible.

679
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:43,947
Must be a mistake.

680
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:47,350
You're right.
Of course.

681
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,919
Wow.

682
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:24,638
Vamptonite.

683
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:26,072
Friggin' vamptonite.

684
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,725
All right, we need knives.

685
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,927
There's got to be a prep room
or a kitchen somewhere. Come on.

686
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,481
Here's what I don't
understand, Edgar.

687
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:36,633
You are aware
that your little additive

688
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:38,351
has side effects, yes?

689
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,303
Dick warned you
there might be kinks.

690
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:42,656
Yes. He also said
he'd be in touch.

691
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,407
My children are in a panic.

692
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,610
You don't call,
you don't write,

693
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,945
you don't send cookies.

694
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:52,315
Where exactly on the list
is fixing our plague?

695
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,655
My dear friend...

696
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,424
...nowhere.

697
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,993
We <i>want</i> you to burn like
the little roaches you are.

698
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:12,102
Roman said if I kept quiet,
I would get my reward.

699
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,387
And now you get to lay down
and die.

700
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,022
Nothing personal.

701
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:19,225
Our additive kills
the wolves, too...

702
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:21,611
the shifters, and those
disgusting little things

703
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,862
that eat corpses.

704
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:26,082
Anything with a taste
for human.

705
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,118
Except us.

706
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:31,004
Mankind's a limited resource,
after all.

707
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:36,126
There are seven <i>billion...</i>

708
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,527
of them.

709
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:39,696
Only seven.

710
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,385
- We come from you.
- Barely.

711
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:48,888
I am the <i>son</i> of Eve!

712
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:51,257
A pathetic mutt.

713
00:36:51,308 --> 00:36:52,875
Hardly one of us.

714
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,979
I knew Eve,

715
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,198
and honestly...

716
00:36:58,232 --> 00:36:59,716
your mommy was a whore.

717
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:15,198
Don't squirm.
I need every last drop.

718
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,084
Hey!

719
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,095
Grab a glass.
We're juicing this freak.

720
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,246
No!

721
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:31,748
Stay back!

722
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:35,602
Leave her alone.

723
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:37,253
She's been through
quite enough.

724
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:39,756
Now, that's rich...

725
00:37:39,774 --> 00:37:42,475
coming from the guy
who took her off the swing-set.

726
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,427
Do you want to do
this fight?

727
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,199
Or do you want my blood?

728
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:20,146
For taking care of Edgar.

729
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:21,631
Now go.

730
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,307
What about the little boy?

731
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:33,443
Are you joking?

732
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,995
Do we look like
we're joking?

733
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,531
How many other kids
you got in here, you freak?

734
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:42,585
At the moment, just him.

735
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,727
Emily...

736
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,345
help Allan with his coat.

737
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:54,113
He's leaving
with Sam and Dean.

738
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,002
Now, take it.

739
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:13,516
What?
No "thank you"?

740
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:17,003
Oh, right, right.

741
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:19,072
Your flesh is crawling.

742
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,659
All you really want to do
is kill me now.

743
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,145
You hate having to wait
and come back and try <i>again.</i>

744
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,981
Pretty much.

745
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:31,851
I wouldn't leave that head
too close to that body

746
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:33,686
for too long.

747
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:36,723
See you next season.

748
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:39,175
Looking forward to it.

749
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,818
Let's never do <i>that</i> again.

750
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,520
Cops thought
<i>we</i> took that kid.

751
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,071
Long as he gets back
to his folks,

752
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:53,523
I don't care
what they thought.

753
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,408
We had to jump out
a freakin' window, man.

754
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,543
Bobby.

755
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,545
Bobby?!

756
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,679
Dean?

757
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:19,799
He's gone.

758
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:39,322
I'm getting trace bits of EMF,
but it's fading fast.

759
00:40:39,357 --> 00:40:42,726
And Bobby's probably been gone
three or four hours.

760
00:40:44,095 --> 00:40:45,178
He's got the flask, Dean.

761
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:47,013
How the hell are we supposed
to track him?

762
00:40:47,048 --> 00:40:48,732
Look,
I hate to say this...

763
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:51,184
Well, then don't.
He's gone.

764
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,512
How could he do this...
Now?

765
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,230
I mean, we've got half
the freakin' weapon,

766
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:05,615
we're almost there.
It's not him.

767
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,584
I mean, he's not thinking.

768
00:41:07,618 --> 00:41:09,419
So, what, we just keep going
while he's out there like this?

769
00:41:09,453 --> 00:41:10,687
Do we have
any other option?

770
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,758
I mean, it's what
he'd want us to do. Right?

771
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:17,677
Yeah.

772
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:21,431
Yeah, him and Frank
and Cass,

773
00:41:21,465 --> 00:41:23,967
if his marbles
were in the bag.

774
00:41:26,804 --> 00:41:28,722
It's a good thing we got Crowley
in our corner. Right?

775
00:41:28,756 --> 00:41:31,274
Seeing as how it all
comes down to him.

776
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,695
What could possibly
go wrong?

777
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:40,400
Hello...

778
00:41:45,156 --> 00:41:46,439
...Dick.

779
00:41:46,457 --> 00:41:47,490
Mr. Crowley,

780
00:41:47,525 --> 00:41:49,609
we have so much
to talk about.

781
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:52,612
Take a seat.

782
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:59,242
