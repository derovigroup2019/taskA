1
00:00:02,362 --> 00:00:03,822
You know what Cass did?

2
00:00:03,823 --> 00:00:06,440
The dam inside
your brother's head is gone,

3
00:00:06,442 --> 00:00:08,308
and all hell's spilling loose.

4
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:12,913
Every time I close my eyes,
Lucifer is yelling into my head.

5
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:16,450
Good morning, Vietnam!

6
00:00:16,452 --> 00:00:18,035
You know
he's not actually...

7
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:19,319
Yeah.
No, I know that.

8
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:21,154
Try telling that to the volume
control inside my brain.

9
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:23,540
Did you try
the hand thing?

10
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:25,342
Your brother's
probably dead.

11
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,060
Shut up.

12
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:27,928
He said "shut up" to me.

13
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,995
You let me in.

14
00:00:28,997 --> 00:00:31,265
You wanted me, partner.

15
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:33,384
I do believe I've got you,
bunk buddy.

16
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:37,721
No net for you, Sammy.

17
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:01,378
Hey!

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,580
Dick!

19
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:18,762
Dude.

20
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:20,180
Get the hell away from me.

21
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:21,715
You speak friggin' English?

22
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:23,016
Go away!

23
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:24,217
It's okay.

24
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,319
No one's after me.

25
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:26,687
Why are you running up in here
like that?

26
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,222
Just...
Just leave me alone.

27
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:33,861
What the hell
did you take, anyway?

28
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:35,061
Nothing.

29
00:01:35,063 --> 00:01:36,363
Shut up.

30
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:39,366
No, he's telling the truth.

31
00:01:39,368 --> 00:01:42,085
Burned through that last beer
hours ago.

32
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:44,738
Right about the time
Dean passed out.

33
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,957
Come on, Sam.
Tell the nice tweaker.

34
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,292
You'd be sleeping by now

35
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:50,911
if the devil would just leave
you alone for five seconds.

36
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:52,713
Stupid Satan.

37
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:56,633
Chasing you all the way to...
Where the hell are we?

38
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:58,385
Ugh!

39
00:01:58,387 --> 00:01:59,470
I just need some rest.

40
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:01,889
Hey. Sam.

41
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:04,391
Try the hand scar.

42
00:02:04,393 --> 00:02:06,143
How many days
you been up, anyway?

43
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:07,260
Four.

44
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:10,063
Oh. Wait. Scratch that.

45
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,065
Five.

46
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:15,435
Hey, hold up! Wait!
Hold up!

47
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:18,872
You want to knock out?
I can knock you out.

48
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:50,571
? Good morning to you ?

49
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:52,356
? good morning to you ?

50
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:54,658
? our day is beginning ?

51
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,911
? so good morning to you ?

52
00:02:57,913 --> 00:03:00,697
I thought you liked
my singing!

53
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,416
Pills?

54
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:04,952
You do get that you're just
bringing free drugs

55
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:06,003
to the party, right?

56
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:08,338
I am <i>inside</i> you, Sam.

57
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,624
Hey. Sam.

58
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:12,876
What's the longest
a normal human being

59
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,345
has ever gone
without sleep?

60
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:17,998
11 days.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,766
Hey.

62
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:21,835
You always wanted
to be normal, Sam!

63
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:25,889
If you are,
you'll be dead in a week!

66
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,553
Okay, sir? You can't just barge
in here without an appointment!

67
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,138
They said, "Talk to Kadinsky."
You Kadinsky?

68
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,290
- You need to be scheduled!
- Well, then, schedule me!

69
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,424
He was in a car crash.

70
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,592
Why the hell
can't I see him?

71
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:48,610
You're Sam Smith's brother.

72
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:49,561
Yeah, what's going on?

73
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,147
I-it's fine.
Thank you.

74
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,348
Really.

75
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,369
Sam was admitted.

76
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:02,574
He was treated for a broken rib
and lacerations.

77
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,411
- Okay. That's not too bad. And?
- And...

78
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:08,881
He's on our locked
psychiatric floor.

79
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:13,302
I mean,
he's had some trouble...

80
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:15,387
So you're aware that Sam
is experiencing

81
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,106
a full-blown
psychotic episode?

82
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,257
Psychotic?

83
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,225
Come on.
I mean, the guy's...

84
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:23,228
It's not like the guy's
freakin' Norman Bates.

85
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,696
No, I'm sure he isn't.

86
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,882
We need to determine whether
his state was brought on

87
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:28,167
by the insomnia

88
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,069
or whether the insomnia is
a symptom of his condition.

89
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,220
Do you understand?

90
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:33,822
So that we can figure out
how to treat him.

91
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:37,075
Well, all I can say is that
the sleep thing is kind of new.

92
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,045
Right.

93
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:43,415
Well...we've pumped him
about as full of sedatives

94
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,666
as we safely can.

95
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:46,618
So far,
he won't go under.

96
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,720
I've never seen
anything like it.

97
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,180
I'm just sayin'.

98
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:00,516
Back when you had
no soul...

99
00:05:00,518 --> 00:05:02,768
You never had to sleep.

100
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,941
Ah, Mr. Helpless.

101
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:11,193
Pull up a six-pack, buddy.

102
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:12,427
How are you feeling?

103
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:14,563
Maybe you
should cancel my UFC fight.

104
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:17,065
Yeah. Keep that
sense of humor, Sam.

105
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,934
It'll get you through this.

106
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,207
Sam, I'm gonna
find you help.

107
00:05:26,944 --> 00:05:30,078
Now, that sounded
a little cynical.

108
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,713
I don't think
it's out there, Dean.

109
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:32,614
We don't know that.

110
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:33,749
We know better than most.

111
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,151
It's all snake oil.

112
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:38,770
Last faith healer
we hooked up with

113
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:42,140
had a reaper on a leash.
Remember?

114
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,976
Yeah...

115
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:45,844
Sam, I remember.

116
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,181
I'm just saying...

117
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,298
What?

118
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,067
That you don't want
my help?

119
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:53,936
No, I'm just saying

120
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,637
Don't do this to yourself.

121
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,305
Sam, if I don't find
something --

122
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:58,607
Then I'll die.

123
00:05:58,609 --> 00:05:59,942
Oh, you're upsetting me.

124
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,393
Dean, we knew
this was coming.

125
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,829
- No. No.
- When you put my soul back.

126
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,030
Cass warned you about
all the crap it would --

127
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,315
Screw Cass!

128
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:10,419
Quit being dali frickin' Yoda
about this, okay?

129
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:11,503
Get pissed!

130
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,874
I'm too tired.

131
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,212
This is what happens
when you throw a soul

132
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,597
into Lucifer's dog bowl.

133
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,334
When you think there's just
gonna be some cure out there?

134
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,224
Oh, you guys
are having a moment.

135
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,234
I'm a friend
of Bobby Singer's.

136
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,351
I'm looking for some info.

137
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:44,903
If you could, uh,
call me back.

138
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,490
785-555-0128.

139
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,691
Thanks.

140
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,056
I am so sorry
to have bothered you.

141
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:07,426
Narcissistic
personality disorder.

142
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,978
Okay, now,
this one I could have.

143
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:15,017
Time for meds, Sam.

144
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:18,770
Sets unrealistic goals.
Check.

145
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,608
<i>But</i> trouble keeping
healthy relationships?

146
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,577
Not so sure about that one.
Thoughts?

147
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,518
Yeah. Thanks.

148
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,899
Yeah, hi. Uh...
my name's Dean.

149
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,118
I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's.

150
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,286
I'm, uh, looking for some info.

151
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,673
If you could call me back
at 785-555-0128.

152
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:13,375
Thanks.

153
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,414
Sam,
how are we feeling today?

154
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,717
Rib pain --
scale of 1 to 10?

155
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:24,670
- It's -- it's not bad.
- Um

156
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,254
3.

157
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:30,308
You don't have
to lie, Sam.

158
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,595
I'm -- I'm not.

159
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,348
You've suffered
terrible agony.

160
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,467
I mean, your 10
must be astronomical.

161
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,852
Yeah. I-I guess
I have a high threshold.

162
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,637
Yeah.

163
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,440
But the worst is knowing
that there's always a new 10.

164
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,144
What are you
talking about?

165
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:53,081
Well, I'm talking about
the truly elegant torture

166
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,451
I have prepared
for you today, Sam.

167
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,759
Just stay the hell
away from me.

168
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:06,294
But it's --
it's so nice chatting.

169
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,431
Sam, I hate these
one-sided conversations.

170
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,433
Come on, buddy.
Engage.

171
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:13,101
Sam?

172
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:15,103
You...

173
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:16,855
Me...

174
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,106
Locked ward.

175
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:21,943
Is it me, or is this
just like the cage?

176
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,820
This is Dean.

177
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:06,938
Mackey.
Calling you back.

178
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,191
Hey. Real sorry
about Bobby.

179
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,225
Yeah, me too.

180
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:12,444
Look,
what you called about --

181
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,496
I might have something
for you.

182
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:17,949
There's this guy.
He goes by "Emanuel."

183
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,234
He kind of roams.

184
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:22,254
First started hearing about him
a couple of months back.

185
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:25,073
Now, he was healing the sick,
curing the crazy.

186
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:26,291
Uh-huh.

187
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,261
Naturally, I think something
in the milk ain't clean.

188
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,412
Find this sucker,
punch his clock.

189
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:32,964
- Right?
- Right.

190
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,966
Heard the best way to get
to him is through his wife,

191
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,435
Daphne, out in Colorado?

192
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,771
So, I go.

193
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,724
Tell her I'm going blind.
It's true.

194
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,592
My right eye's burnt out.

195
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:47,262
She says, "Go home.
He'll come."

196
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:49,648
So, I go.

197
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,767
I set every trap,
every test in the book.

198
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,569
That's what I
would have done.

199
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,654
Emanuel shows.

200
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,372
He passes every one.

201
00:10:57,374 --> 00:11:00,775
There ain't nothing weird
about this guy.

202
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:02,294
Except...

203
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,829
He's the real deal.

204
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,297
What do you mean?

205
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,465
He touched me,

206
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,584
and my eye was fixed.

207
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,221
Look -- I don't believe in much
that don't suck your blood.

208
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:16,624
But I wouldn't call you
on a maybe.

209
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:21,229
"Oh, my head hurts.

210
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:22,564
Make it stop!"

211
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:24,015
Hello?

212
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,519
You want this or not?

213
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,138
I saw you yesterday.

214
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,574
You didn't look too happy
with your in-flight meal.

215
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:34,776
Thanks. Uh...

216
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,494
Marin.
No problem.

217
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,646
Sam. Right?

218
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:40,448
"That's it.

219
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,483
I'm Sam."

220
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,889
"I'm Sam. Hi."

221
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,668
Hi. Uh, is this, uh,
Daphne Allen's house?

222
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,103
I'm looking for Emanuel.

223
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,688
Well, you found him.

224
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,390
Daphne's resting.

225
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,641
If you don't mind.

226
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,976
Oh, yeah, sure.

227
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,613
Um

228
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:14,532
So, I was hoping...

229
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,212
You were saying, Dean?

230
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,880
You know,
I'd think twice.

231
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,301
Or don't you know that your boss
issued a hands-off memo?

232
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:34,803
Please.

233
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:36,304
What have you done
for him lately?

234
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:39,758
Roman's head on a plate?
No?

235
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,177
Whatever Emanuel is,
Crowley's gonna want him --

236
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,596
a lot more than he wants <i>you</i>
these days.

237
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,065
So...

238
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,217
Aah!

239
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,036
What <i>was</i> that?

240
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:17,536
That creature hurt you.

241
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:22,262
I'm okay.

242
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:27,717
But, Emanuel...

243
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,434
They were looking
for you.

244
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:30,501
It's okay.

245
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:38,308
I'm Emanuel.

246
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:42,329
Dean. I'm...Dean.

247
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:43,914
Thank you for protecting
my wife.

248
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,701
Your wife. Right.

249
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:48,369
I saw his face.

250
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,638
His <i>real</i> face.

251
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,456
He was a demon.

252
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:55,509
A demon
walked the Earth.

253
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:58,379
<i>Demons.</i>

254
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:00,081
Whackloads of them.

255
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,348
You don't know about...

256
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:07,104
You saw the demon's
true face.

257
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,006
Emanuel has
very special gifts.

258
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:12,843
Yeah.
I-I've heard that about...

259
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,378
Emanuel.

260
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,230
That you can
heal people up.

261
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:19,016
I seem to be able to help
to a certain degree.

262
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:21,719
What's your issue?

263
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,574
My brother.

264
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,830
? <i>Wake up, little susie</i> ?

265
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:35,082
? <i>wake up</i> ?

266
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:38,135
? <i>wake up, little susie</i> ?

267
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:39,837
? <i>wake up</i> ?

268
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:45,426
You know, you're actually
keeping it together

269
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:47,228
better than I thought.

270
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,265
Kind of...the way someone
pinned under a bus

271
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:52,316
keeps it together.

272
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:53,451
None of this is real.

273
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:56,103
And yet...
you know what really sucks?

274
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,456
It doesn't really matter.

275
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:03,327
Because I won.

276
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:05,396
Your madness won.

277
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:06,464
I mean, look at you.

278
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:07,765
It's hard to believe

279
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,416
you were the guy
that saved the world once.

280
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,255
Mmm! Sammy.

281
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:17,274
What'll be today?
Maggots again...

282
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:18,943
Or, uh, tapeworm?

283
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:19,960
Thanks.

284
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,796
Yeah, no problem.

285
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:23,881
How are you doing?

286
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:26,267
Uh...little better.

287
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:29,136
That girl, uh, Marin...

288
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:32,940
Look, I'm not really
supposed to talk about it.

289
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:34,725
Let's just say,
unlike you,

290
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:36,977
she didn't get here
'cause of no accident.

291
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,131
So, Daphne --

292
00:15:57,133 --> 00:16:00,467
is that, uh, your wife?

293
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:02,636
She found me
and cared for me.

294
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:04,505
Meaning?

295
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:08,475
Oh, it's a...strange story.
You may not like it.

296
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:11,262
Believe me, I will.

297
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:17,351
A few months ago,
she was hiking by the river,

298
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:19,803
and I wandered
into her path,

299
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:24,575
drenched and confused,
and...unclothed.

300
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:27,144
I had no memory.

301
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:29,496
She said...

302
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:31,699
God wanted her
to find me.

303
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,538
So who named you Emanuel?

304
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,458
Bouncybabynames.com.

305
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:45,512
Well, it's working
for you.

306
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:48,215
Must be weird
not knowing who you are.

307
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,384
Well, it's my life.

308
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:52,636
And it's a good life.

309
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:55,689
Yeah, well, what if you were
some kind of...

310
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:58,508
I don't know...bad guy?

311
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,778
Oh, I...

312
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,397
don't feel like
a bad person.

313
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,193
Man,
you must be really determined

314
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:17,878
to wait out nap time.

315
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,297
Here.

316
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:21,865
Wait. Uh...

317
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:24,418
...share this with me.

318
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,388
Thanks.

319
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,975
I don't know why I'm thanking
you for a candy bar I stole.

320
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:41,185
So, how long you been here?

321
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:42,552
Five weeks and counting.

322
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:43,771
Going for the record.

323
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,789
How come?

324
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,224
It doesn't matter.

325
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:51,111
That's a lot of bandages
for "it doesn't matter."

326
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,562
You want the doctor answer?

327
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:56,333
I'm psychotically depressed
to a suicidal ideation.

328
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:58,702
And the <i>not</i> doctor answer?

329
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:02,539
I feel like crap.

330
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,843
I just...
want it to be over.

331
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:07,127
What?

332
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:10,965
Everything.

333
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:14,184
Come on.
Tell me I'm young

334
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:16,053
and have everything
to live for.

335
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:18,939
Why would you believe me?

336
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,909
True.

337
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:24,928
I heard <i>you're</i> here

338
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,464
because the voices
won't let you sleep.

339
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,118
Just <i>one,</i> really.

340
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,569
Who is it?

341
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:35,489
Like Charlie Manson
or the devil?

342
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,626
Kind of. Yeah.

343
00:18:39,628 --> 00:18:42,846
Me too.

344
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:45,649
I...hear a voice.

345
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:48,836
Is that why
you set the fire?

346
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:51,689
Who told you that?

347
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:54,258
No one.
T-they're burns, right?

348
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,144
I didn't set the fire, o--
<i>he</i> did!

349
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,397
You know what? I don't even know
why I'm talking.

350
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:01,565
Marin, it's okay.

351
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:02,666
No, it's not!

352
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:04,768
You are crazier
than I am!

353
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,404
Charles Manson tells you
what to do.

354
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:09,806
At least
it's my own brother --

355
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:11,358
It's your brother?

356
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,277
Yes.

357
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,581
It sucks...

358
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,284
when it's your
dead brother saying...

359
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:22,503
kill yourself
to be with him...

360
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,789
...or he'll do it for you.

361
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:31,762
So, your brother...

362
00:19:31,764 --> 00:19:32,930
Sam.

363
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:34,765
Sam.

364
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,801
What's his diagnosis?

365
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,836
Well

366
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:42,272
it's not exactly medical.

367
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:43,774
That should be fine.

368
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:46,860
I can cure illness
of a spiritual origin.

369
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:48,479
Spiritual?

370
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:50,314
Okay.

371
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:53,734
Someone did this to him.

372
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,539
You're angry.

373
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,540
Well, yeah.

374
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,024
Dude broke
my brother's head.

375
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:03,577
He betrayed you,
this dude.

376
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,497
He was your friend?

377
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,634
Yeah, well, he's gone.

378
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:12,052
Did you kill him?

379
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:16,873
I sense that you kill
a lot of people.

380
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,043
Honestly, I-I don't know
if he's dead.

381
00:20:22,313 --> 00:20:25,315
I just know that this...

382
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,267
whole thing
couldn't be messier.

383
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,687
You know, I used to be able
to just shake this stuff off.

384
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,022
You know,
whatever it was.

385
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,607
It might take me some time,
but...

386
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,943
I always could.

387
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,366
What Cass did...

388
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:44,118
I just can't --
I don't know why.

389
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,919
Well,
it doesn't matter why.

390
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,404
Of course it matters.

391
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:49,406
No. You're not
a machine, Dean.

392
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:50,674
You're human.

393
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,678
Your friend's name
was Cass?

394
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,265
That's an odd name.

395
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:15,282
Oh, hey, hey.

396
00:21:15,284 --> 00:21:17,818
Just, uh, sit tight.
I'll be right out, okay?

397
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:50,934
Oh, come on.

398
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:23,016
Emanuel,
you son of a bitch.

399
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:25,185
Emanuel.

400
00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:27,187
Yeah, not so much.

401
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:31,975
Meg.

402
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:35,445
Dean, Dean, Dean.
You got some 'splainin' to do.

403
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:55,364
Rumors are really starting to
fly about this Emanuel fellow.

404
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,667
My curiosity
sure got revved up.

405
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,137
Just tell me
what you want, Meg.

406
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:02,222
Imagine my surprise
when I track him down,

407
00:23:02,224 --> 00:23:03,807
and he's snuggled up
with <i>you.</i>

408
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:06,160
And he's the spitting image
of poor, dead Castiel.

409
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:07,978
So, Dean,
what's poor, dead Castiel

410
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,563
doing in that junker
out there?

411
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:10,664
Christmas caroling.

412
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,449
Fun.
But how's he alive?

413
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:15,152
Last I heard, he played God,
went poof.

414
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:16,686
I don't know.

415
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,706
And neither does he,
so you got to keep it shut.

416
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,191
Oh, I do?

417
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,826
He doesn't know he's Cass.

418
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:25,546
I know.
Been watching you for hours.

419
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:27,431
So here's the deal.

420
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:29,299
You might remember
Crowley and me

421
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:31,768
were frosty
back in the day?

422
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,220
- Well, times haven't changed.
- Good.

423
00:23:33,222 --> 00:23:35,889
That hurts my feelings.
I've been good to you, Dean.

424
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:38,875
No, you've been good to <i>you,</i>
sweetheart.

425
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,227
Look.

426
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:42,646
Right now, rumors
of this wandering healer

427
00:23:42,648 --> 00:23:43,981
are strictly low-level.

428
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:46,716
But body count's getting
high enough to change that.

429
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,069
Folks start poking,
they sniff angel dust.

430
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:51,738
Yeah, they start falling
all over each other

431
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,156
trying to tell Crowley.

432
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:55,242
Now picture Crowley
with his hands

433
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:57,411
on harmless
little amnesia Cass.

434
00:23:57,413 --> 00:23:58,579
Don't get me wrong.

435
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:00,697
I'm gonna burn
that smarmy dick.

436
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:01,748
My time's coming.

437
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,501
But right about now,
my army-of-one situation

438
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:05,702
is not cutting it.

439
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:07,788
It's cold out here,
there's a price on my ass,

440
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,822
and I need friends.

441
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,740
Yeah. I get that.

442
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,409
But I ain't it.

443
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,595
That's where
you're wrong, Dean.

444
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:16,597
'Cause I'm here
to help you,

445
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,265
and that makes us friends.

446
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:20,767
Help, huh?

447
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:23,854
You mean see if you can't turn
harmless little Cass out there

448
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:25,889
into an
angel-sized weapon?

449
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:27,591
Like you're taking
him caroling.

450
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:30,944
And by the way, you really want
to keep going with no backup?

451
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:33,363
Hey, I don't trust you,
either.

452
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:35,699
But I could really
use Emanuel.

453
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:37,200
And <i>he</i> trusts you.

454
00:24:37,202 --> 00:24:39,620
So for now, it's in everyone's
best interests

455
00:24:39,622 --> 00:24:42,606
to hold hands and cross
the street together, okay?

456
00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:45,442
We go straight to Sam.

457
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,877
No detours.

458
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:48,512
I love it.

459
00:24:48,514 --> 00:24:50,497
And one more thing.

460
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:54,167
My knife.

461
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,507
You sure
we wouldn't be safer

462
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:03,010
traveling with
a full-throttle Angel?

463
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:05,178
I could jog his memory.

464
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,180
Kidding!

465
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:10,651
We wouldn't want to upset
the poor guy.

466
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:17,941
Her face!
She's one of --

467
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:20,410
It's okay.
We come in different flavors.

468
00:25:20,412 --> 00:25:22,829
She's, uh...a friend.

469
00:25:23,531 --> 00:25:25,232
Meg.

470
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,167
Just here
for moral support.

471
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:29,870
I mean, after all,
we go way back.

472
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:31,821
Dean and me.

473
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:35,208
Just met you, of course.

474
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:39,546
I think we're gonna be
good friends, too.

475
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:43,717
All right.
Can we go?

476
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:51,441
Marin. Marin, hey.
Hold on.

477
00:25:57,382 --> 00:25:59,900
Um...I'm sorry
I upset you.

478
00:25:59,902 --> 00:26:02,986
It's okay.

479
00:26:02,988 --> 00:26:04,571
Can I ask you something?

480
00:26:04,573 --> 00:26:06,673
About?

481
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:08,241
The fire.

482
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:11,161
Look. You mean well,
but you have no idea --

483
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:13,213
You said
you didn't start it.

484
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:14,831
I believe you.

485
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,967
I can help you, Marin,

486
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:19,202
before he tries
to hurt you again.

487
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,661
You're worse.

488
00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:29,379
Your organs need sleep,
you know.

489
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,431
Your hair and nails
are gonna fall out,

490
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,433
and your kidneys
are gonna shut down.

491
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:34,668
I saw it in a movie.

492
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,187
Sorry.

493
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:43,226
So, um, your brother --

494
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:45,862
when did he pass?

495
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:48,064
Uh, last year.

496
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,633
Do you see him?

497
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:53,837
So...

498
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,589
He just talks to you.

499
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,546
But at first
it wasn't so bad.

500
00:27:02,548 --> 00:27:03,513
You must have missed him.

501
00:27:03,515 --> 00:27:05,015
Did you just hear him
at the house?

502
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:06,516
Here too.

503
00:27:06,518 --> 00:27:07,517
Whenever I'm alone.

504
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,219
I can always tell
he's coming

505
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:10,854
because I get
these chills.

506
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:12,639
You feel cold.

507
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:13,774
Yeah.

508
00:27:13,776 --> 00:27:17,894
I mean, you're right.

509
00:27:17,896 --> 00:27:19,730
At first it's like...

510
00:27:19,732 --> 00:27:22,365
I knew I was crazy,
but...

511
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:24,284
I didn't really care.

512
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:26,603
I did miss him.

513
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:30,106
But then...

514
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:33,877
He started saying
he was lonely.

515
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:35,712
And he started
to get mad.

516
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:37,831
And one day
he started yelling,

517
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:40,050
and I tried to run
but the door was locked.

518
00:27:40,052 --> 00:27:43,887
And when I turned around,
the whole room was on fire.

519
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:47,474
I barely got out.

520
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,645
How can you help me?

521
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:54,564
I can put your brother
to rest.

522
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:58,268
He's, um...

523
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,687
He's stuck here.

524
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:01,855
For real? Like --

525
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:04,324
Like he's a ghost.

526
00:28:04,326 --> 00:28:07,260
Why should I trust you?

527
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:10,447
Because it's your
only shot.

528
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,534
Okay.

529
00:28:14,536 --> 00:28:16,203
Okay.

530
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:20,373
So, your brother --
was he cremated? Buried?

531
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:21,991
We cremated him.

532
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,460
And do you have
anything of his?

533
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:28,765
This.
He made it for me.

534
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:31,168
With a busted hand, too.

535
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,687
Sliced it open
doing stupid archery.

536
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:34,888
He bled on it?

537
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,274
Probably.

538
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:38,492
Good.
That's -- that's good.

539
00:28:38,494 --> 00:28:39,509
Why is that good?

540
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:40,644
One more question.

541
00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:44,231
Is there any chance in hell
you got a lighter?

542
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,861
This silence
is very uncomfortable.

543
00:28:57,863 --> 00:28:59,546
Is there something
I should know?

544
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:01,832
I don't know.

545
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:03,133
Dean?

546
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:05,335
No.

547
00:29:05,337 --> 00:29:07,203
Meg has that effect.

548
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:09,372
Awkward. You know?

549
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:11,675
That must be difficult
for you.

550
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:15,512
Dean's making a joke,
Emanuel.

551
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,849
Oh.

552
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:27,357
Nice.

553
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,742
Where'd you score that?

554
00:29:28,744 --> 00:29:30,226
Grabbed it out of
Marcus' pocket.

555
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:32,495
Being locked up is really
turning me into a decent criminal.

556
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:36,449
We're laying down
a circle.

557
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:38,618
Help me open these, okay?

558
00:29:52,434 --> 00:29:54,267
You're gonna have to do this
on your own.

559
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:56,436
It's okay. I'm okay.
I'm just having a little...

560
00:29:56,438 --> 00:29:59,022
Brown acid moment.
...Dizzy thing.

561
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:00,223
It'll pass.

562
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:03,059
Definitely.
When your heart stops.

563
00:30:03,978 --> 00:30:05,145
Great. Now, um...

564
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:07,614
Stay with me
in the circle.

565
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,565
No matter what.

566
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:09,816
No matter
what happens, okay?

567
00:30:09,818 --> 00:30:11,368
What's gonna happen?

568
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,153
Give me the bracelet.

569
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,448
Marin, don't do this.
<i>Please.</i>

570
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,783
Marin, give me
the bracelet.

571
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,969
I'm so sorry. I have to.

572
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:44,017
Noooo!

573
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:50,323
Y-you got to go.

574
00:30:50,325 --> 00:30:51,975
Go.

575
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:55,612
Thank you.

576
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:10,126
Sam?
How you feeling now?

577
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:12,462
His soul is broken, Doc.

578
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:13,463
Can you give him a pill?

579
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:14,764
I can't give you
any more medication.

580
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:18,385
The potential for overdose
is too great.

581
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:20,904
We need to talk
about surgical solutions.

582
00:31:20,906 --> 00:31:22,622
Surgical?

583
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,840
Ooh. Lobotomy?

584
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:25,642
It's okay.
We're not talking lobotomy here.

585
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:27,527
Darn.

586
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:29,062
Sam.

587
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:30,864
Are you with me?

588
00:31:45,163 --> 00:31:48,531
Oh, gracious.

589
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,333
Damn it. Demons.

590
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:51,768
All of them?

591
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,320
No grass growing
under <i>your</i> feet.

592
00:31:54,322 --> 00:31:56,840
How many of those knives
do you have?

593
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:59,342
Just the one.

594
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:02,529
Well, then, forgive me,
but what do we do?

595
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:03,730
Yeah, Dean.

596
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:05,765
Got any other ideas
how we could blast through that?

597
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:09,436
Excuse us.

598
00:32:09,438 --> 00:32:11,104
Meg?

599
00:32:11,106 --> 00:32:14,024
Oh, for the love of...

600
00:32:14,026 --> 00:32:17,277
Sam's in there.

601
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,411
I know you're enjoying
the double dip

602
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:19,996
with your old pal, but --

603
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:21,164
You think
it's that cut and dry?

604
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,316
Really?

605
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:25,035
You know what he did.

606
00:32:25,037 --> 00:32:26,119
And you want to tell him

607
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:28,254
and just hope that he takes it
in stride?

608
00:32:28,256 --> 00:32:29,756
He could snap.
He could...disappear.

609
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:30,757
Who knows?

610
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,509
I gather
we know each other.

611
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:35,428
Just a dollop.

612
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,298
You can tell me.
I'll be fine.

613
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,766
How do you know?

614
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:42,469
You just met yourself.
I've known you for years.

615
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:43,803
You're an Angel.

616
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:47,857
I'm sorry?
Is that a flirtation?

617
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:49,592
No, it's a species.

618
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:51,444
A very powerful one.

619
00:32:51,446 --> 00:32:53,696
She's not lying.

620
00:32:53,698 --> 00:32:55,932
Okay? That's why
you heal people.

621
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,617
You don't eat.

622
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:59,786
I'm sure there's more.

623
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:02,906
Why wouldn't you
tell me?

624
00:33:02,908 --> 00:33:05,542
Being an angel --
it sounds pleasant.

625
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:07,494
It's not. Trust me.

626
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:09,278
It's bloody.
It's corrupt.

627
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,464
It's not pleasant.

628
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:12,982
He would know.

629
00:33:12,984 --> 00:33:15,068
You used to
fight together.

630
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,003
Bestest friends,
actually.

631
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:19,422
We're...friends?

632
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:24,594
Am I Cass?

633
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:30,900
I-I had no idea.

634
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:33,103
I don't remember you.
I'm sorry.

635
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:34,821
Look.
You got the juice.

636
00:33:34,823 --> 00:33:38,108
You can smite every demon
in that lot.

637
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:48,985
But I don't remember how.

638
00:33:51,755 --> 00:33:54,124
It's in there.

639
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:56,876
I'm sure it's just like
riding a bike.

640
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:00,597
I don't know how
to do that, either.

641
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:08,771
All right, I'll try.

642
00:34:13,477 --> 00:34:15,979
This ain't gonna go well.

643
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:17,197
I don't know.

644
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,783
I believe in
the little tree topper.

645
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:32,028
Hey, I know you.

646
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,529
You're dead.

647
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,581
Yes, I've heard.

648
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,435
I'm sorry, Dean.

649
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:03,392
That's my boy.

650
00:35:07,748 --> 00:35:10,116
I don't think
running will save you.

651
00:35:20,844 --> 00:35:24,497
That was beautiful,
Clarence.

652
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,582
Cass?

653
00:35:28,936 --> 00:35:31,554
I remember you.

654
00:35:36,694 --> 00:35:39,229
I remember everything.

655
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:52,786
What I did.

656
00:35:52,788 --> 00:35:55,238
What I became.

657
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,407
Why didn't you tell me?

658
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:58,992
Because Sam is dying
in there.

659
00:35:58,994 --> 00:36:00,377
Because of me.

660
00:36:00,379 --> 00:36:02,429
Everything.

661
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:04,080
All these people.

662
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:06,282
I shouldn't be here.

663
00:36:06,284 --> 00:36:07,884
Cass. Cass!

664
00:36:07,886 --> 00:36:09,335
You stay here.

665
00:36:09,337 --> 00:36:10,954
Cass!

666
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:27,987
Where...

667
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:29,806
Where -- where are we?

668
00:36:29,808 --> 00:36:32,325
Electroshock therapy.

669
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:33,493
Let's just get you
settled.

670
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:34,494
Don't be freaked.

671
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:35,528
I've seen this help
a lot of people.

672
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:37,814
My brother.

673
00:36:37,816 --> 00:36:39,032
Bite down.

674
00:36:43,754 --> 00:36:47,207
Ordinarily, they keep
this thing set on low.

675
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:49,759
But I was thinking
we could experiment a little.

676
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:51,828
What do you say, Sam?

677
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,632
Let's get that head
strapped in.

678
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:01,971
If you remember,

679
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:04,607
then you know you did the best
you could at the time.

680
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:06,276
<i>Don't</i> defend me.

681
00:37:06,278 --> 00:37:08,611
Do you have any idea
the death toll in heaven?

682
00:37:08,613 --> 00:37:10,012
On Earth?

683
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:14,117
We didn't part friends,
Dean.

684
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,286
So what?

685
00:37:16,288 --> 00:37:18,238
I <i>deserved</i> to die.

686
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,158
Now, I can't possibly
fix it...

687
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,695
So why did I even walk out
of that river?

688
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:29,833
Maybe <i>to</i> fix it.

689
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:32,418
Wait.

690
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,157
Amazing.

691
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:56,058
You just take those lickin's,
don't you, kid?

692
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,827
Well, if it's meat,
you can cook it.

693
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:00,330
You just got to turn up
the heat.

694
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:16,546
I should never have broken
your wall, Sam.

695
00:38:16,548 --> 00:38:17,964
I'm here to make it right.

696
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,858
You're not real.

697
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,196
Sam...

698
00:38:35,316 --> 00:38:36,866
...I'm so sorry.

699
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:47,425
I see that third
little pig was smart.

700
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,057
Went out and got
some bricks.

701
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:52,076
What the hell
do you mean you <i>can't?</i>

702
00:38:52,078 --> 00:38:54,695
I mean there's nothing left
to rebuild.

703
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:56,697
Why not?

704
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:57,831
Because it crumbled.

705
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,534
The pieces got crushed
to dust

706
00:39:00,536 --> 00:39:03,003
by whatever's happening
inside his head right now.

707
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:09,009
So you're saying
there's nothing?

708
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:11,478
That he's gonna be like this
until his candle blows out?

709
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,613
I'm sorry.

710
00:39:12,615 --> 00:39:16,267
This isn't a problem
I can make disappear.

711
00:39:16,269 --> 00:39:19,436
And you know that.

712
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:27,528
But I may be able
to shift it.

713
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,430
Shift?

714
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:31,632
Yeah, it would get Sam
back on his feet.

715
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,373
It's better this way.

716
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:43,177
- I'll be fine.
- Wait, Cass, what are you doing?

717
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:44,911
Now, Sam...

718
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:47,548
This may hurt.

719
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,351
And if I can't
tell you again...

720
00:39:50,353 --> 00:39:52,720
I'm sorry I ever did this
to you.

721
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,320
Sam?

722
00:40:09,322 --> 00:40:10,237
Sam!

723
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:10,937
Dean!

724
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:12,790
- Sam!
- Cass?

725
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,459
Cass, is that you?

726
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:20,631
Hello...Brother.

727
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:39,350
I don't know.

728
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:41,101
We can't just leave him.

729
00:40:41,103 --> 00:40:42,903
Well, we can't bring him
with us.

730
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:44,438
Everything on the planet's
out for us, okay?

731
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,574
Word gets out,
we can't protect him.

732
00:40:47,576 --> 00:40:49,309
Not really.

733
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:50,477
This is safer.

734
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:52,496
Every demon who knows
about Cass is dead.

735
00:40:52,498 --> 00:40:53,747
Not everyone.

736
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:55,649
Look, Dean, this whole

737
00:40:55,651 --> 00:40:56,867
"enemy of my enemy
is my friend" thing

738
00:40:56,869 --> 00:40:58,168
feels kind of like
a demon deal.

739
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,319
It's not a deal.
It's --

740
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:00,387
It's what?

741
00:41:02,374 --> 00:41:04,875
Mutually assured
destruction.

742
00:41:04,877 --> 00:41:08,512
Look, man, I get it.
She's not our friend.

743
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:09,963
We don't even
have friends.

744
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:11,331
All our friends are dead.

745
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:20,023
Well, you certainly
have experience.

746
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:21,358
I'm impressed.

747
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,110
Tell me --

748
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:26,146
why do you want
to join our staff?

749
00:41:27,014 --> 00:41:29,583
I really just want
to help the patients.

750
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:31,017
Watch over them.

751
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:32,619
Not to be immodest,

752
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:35,823
but I feel like
I'd make a great fit.

753
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:38,959
I can't argue with that.

754
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:42,212
Welcome to the team...

755
00:41:42,214 --> 00:41:43,914
Nurse Masters.
