1
00:00:01,615 --> 00:00:02,916
I don't want another hunter,
Bobby.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,401
Why can't <i>you</i> do it?

3
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:07,254
Fine.

4
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:08,288
What's his name?

5
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:09,956
Yeah, Garth, what do you got?

6
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:11,258
Better drop a dime to the FBI.

7
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:12,926
Hey. You Dean?

8
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:16,129
Hmm. I thought
you'd be taller.

9
00:00:16,147 --> 00:00:17,630
W-what's with
the scrawny guy?

10
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:18,798
Temp.

11
00:00:18,816 --> 00:00:20,767
Willis. FBI.

12
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:25,638
No, Garth, not <i>me,</i> the FBI.
The <i>real</i> FBI!

13
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:27,441
Oh, marmaduke,
you're crazy!

14
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:37,200
How are you still alive?

15
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:38,702
What'd I miss?

16
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:47,961
Long ago,
in these very woods,

17
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:50,297
lived an old woman
by the name...

18
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:52,832
of Jenny Greentree.

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,801
Ooh!

20
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:57,721
Forced out after her family
was killed in a fire,

21
00:00:57,772 --> 00:00:59,005
she lost everything.

22
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:01,841
Some say,
even her humanity.

23
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,144
That is <i>so</i> sad.

24
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:07,280
It's a true story, Ray.
Look.

25
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:10,484
She carved her initials
into that tree...

26
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:12,402
right before she died.

27
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:14,237
Those are <i>not</i>
<i>her initials.</i>

28
00:01:14,288 --> 00:01:16,123
So, how'd she die?

29
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:19,626
One night...
A blizzard hit.

30
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,580
She's cold.
She's hungry.

31
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:26,032
Nowhere to go.
No one to turn to.

32
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,019
Jenny Greentree
froze to death...

33
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:31,338
Right beneath...

34
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:33,140
that tree.

35
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:39,712
And her evil spirit has haunted
these woods ever since.

36
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,516
Don't do that!

37
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,696
You guys should have seen
your faces.

38
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,665
What the hell, Trevor?
That's not funny, man.

39
00:01:58,699 --> 00:01:59,950
To <i>you!</i>

40
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,669
Yo
did you drive here, man?

41
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:06,289
Ahh, please.

42
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,876
Look, why --
why don't you take --

43
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,962
take my phone, okay?

44
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:15,298
Call dad and bust me,
why don't ya?

45
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,517
No, I'm just saying,
you're wasted.

46
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:19,886
You can't just drive --
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,971
I heard ya.

48
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:25,692
What was that?

49
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:28,645
What? No. Trevor,
let's just sit down, okay?

50
00:02:28,696 --> 00:02:30,981
We'll --
shh!!

51
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:33,066
You --
you don't hear that?

52
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:38,154
Trevor,
there's nothing there.

53
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:40,373
All right? Let's just sit down,
and we'll all just --

54
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:41,541
What the...?

55
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:44,711
You got to run.
You got to run!

56
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:45,962
Trevor!

57
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,384
I'm sorry,
but what is your brother on?

58
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:58,925
Trevor!

59
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,010
Trevor!

60
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:06,299
Trev, come on.
Stop being a tool.

61
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:11,605
Come on, trev.
Let's head back.

62
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,773
Dude.

63
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:16,276

72
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:51,895
Ladies.

73
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:53,897
What do you want,
Top Gun?

74
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:55,899
For starters,

75
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,300
I'd like
a little respect.

76
00:03:57,335 --> 00:04:01,104
Sorry, Officer.
We didn't realize.

77
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:02,806
All's forgiven.
Take a seat.

78
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,292
Tell me about
Trevor Mcann.

79
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:06,676
Other night up
at widow's peak.

80
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:08,861
- Okay.
- All right.

81
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,163
It was weird 'cause he was super-drunk.
Well, it was just like he was super-drunk.

82
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:11,281
Whoa.

83
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:14,584
You. Go.

84
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:15,702
It was Jenny Greentree.

85
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,337
Shut up.

86
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:19,022
Okay?
She's just a dumb legend.

87
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:21,992
- Hold up. Who?
- Jenny Greentree.

88
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:24,094
My dad says she <i>really</i> died
in the woods.

89
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:26,112
And she's buried
in the town cemetery.

90
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,387
All right, Jenny G.

91
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:35,655
Your ganking days are over.

92
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:42,862
You've been Garthed.

93
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:45,198
? I was at the bar, shake,
breakin', and taking 'em all ?

94
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:47,117
? and that night,
I played the wall ?

95
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:48,785
? checkin' out the fellas,
the highs, the lows ?

96
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:50,954
? keepin' one eye open,
still clockin' the hoes ?

97
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:53,289
? there was one particular girl
that stood out from the rest ?

98
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:55,125
? poison as can be,
the high power chest ?

99
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:57,627
? Michael Bivins here,
and I'm runnin' the show ?

100
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:59,295
? Bell, Biv, DeVoe ?

101
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:01,014
? ha ha ha ?

102
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,252
<i>Ray, where are you?</i>

103
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,757
<i>You should be with your family</i>
<i>right now.</i>

104
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:13,092
<i>Don't do anything stupid.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

105
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,334
Yeah, I clocked out.
Put it to bed.

106
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,319
Problem solved.

107
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,671
And I'm headed your way,
so, uh...

108
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:34,173
Fire up that hot tub.

109
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:37,227
No, I heart <i>you</i> more.

110
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:42,449
<i>Abandoned vehicle</i>
<i>out by Widow's Peak.</i>

111
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:44,451
<i>Uh, we got another body</i>
<i>up here.</i>

112
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:46,052
<i>Guy's torn to shreds.</i>

113
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:47,253
What?!

114
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,156
No way. How is that possible?
I Garthed her!

115
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:52,525
All right, well,
call us if he wakes up

116
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:54,410
or, you know, anything.

117
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:55,912
Yeah, fine.

118
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:58,414
Thanks for your help,
Meg.

119
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,750
What a bitch.

120
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,919
So, Cass is the same,
then?

121
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,587
Yeah,
down to the drool.

122
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:06,306
Huh.

123
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,343
By the way,
how is your custard?

124
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:13,179
It's all right.
It's getting better.

125
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:15,515
Just wish it wasn't like
the damn tape from "The Ring."

126
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:18,818
I mean, I feel like I'm okay
'cause I passed on the crazy.

127
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:20,320
No, you didn't.
You heard what Cass said.

128
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:22,489
Let's -- let's not. You know what?

129
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:24,991
Hello.

130
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:27,327
Hey, Dean. It's Garth.

131
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:29,546
- Wait. W-who is this?
- Garth.

132
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,663
Garth Fitzgerald iv.

133
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,782
We worked together
on that demon thing?

134
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,950
You owe me one?

135
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:36,369
Oh, yeah.

136
00:07:36,403 --> 00:07:37,620
Yeah, how you doing,
Garth?

137
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:39,189
I'm ready to cash in
that chip, Bra.

138
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:41,841
There's something brewing
in Junction City, Kansas.

139
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:47,096
Well, this is it.

140
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:51,267
Gentlemen...
this is Corporal Brown.

141
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:53,720
Corporal James brown.

142
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:55,805
I'm shipping off
to the A.F. ma?ana.

143
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:57,273
I'm here to pay respects
to my cousin

144
00:07:57,308 --> 00:07:58,992
as I will not be able to
attend the funeral.

145
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:00,777
That must be terrible
for your family.

146
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:03,613
Losing two brothers
so fast.

147
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:07,150
Yeah. Yeah.
My aunt -- she's, uh...

148
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:09,319
she's real broken up
about it.

149
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,988
Hey, Doc,
can we see both files, please?

150
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,040
Mm-hmm.

151
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:18,277
Ah.

152
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:21,214
My wife. I'll, uh,
be in my office.

153
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:23,082
Great.

154
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,303
You didn't say
they were brothers.

155
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:30,089
Dude, I just found out
about the other corpse,

156
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:31,674
and...started
moving quick.

157
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:33,343
I'm sucking up info
as I go.

158
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:34,677
What, are you allergic
to a suit?

159
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,680
No. I just...
Look good in a uniform.

160
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:40,350
Yep.
Same cause of death.

161
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:44,470
Right, uh, gutted at night
in the woods,

162
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:46,072
where legend says

163
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:47,857
that the ghost of
Jenny Greentree roams.

164
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:53,029
Oh, uh, I already scanned
for EM...F.

165
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,698
Oh. Um...

166
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,316
I guess mine
must be broken again.

167
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:59,118
All right.
I'm reading your mail.

168
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:01,454
- Uh, ghost of Jenny...whatever?
- Greentree.

169
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:03,773
That's just it.
I torched her bones.

170
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:05,541
Yeah, well, maybe she's got
something still laying around.

171
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:08,111
Highly doubtful.
Chick was homeless.

172
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:10,129
Plus, is it me,
or is this less evil spirit,

173
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:11,598
more monster chow?

174
00:09:11,632 --> 00:09:13,449
A werewolf?

175
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:14,851
Except the witness said

176
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:17,553
that whatever was chasing
victim numero uno was invisible.

177
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:21,474
Uh
so, invisible ghost werewolf?

178
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:23,576
- Why'd you think I called for backup?
- Hey.

179
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:25,645
Either of you ever heard
of Thighslapper Ale?

180
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,398
Is that a stripper
or a beverage?

181
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:29,832
Beverage for douchebags.

182
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:32,802
Uh, number one microbrew
in the Pacific Northwest.

183
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:34,404
But we're in Kansas.

184
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:36,990
Yeah, I rest my case.
What's your point?

185
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:39,742
The owner is the dad
to the dead brothers.

186
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,528
Right.

187
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:44,530
I'll can the uniform,
go Fed.

188
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:45,915
See you at the brewery
in 40.

189
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:51,621
He grows on you.

190
00:09:59,713 --> 00:10:02,682
Agents. I'm Marie.
I'm a manager.

191
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:04,534
Thanks for coming in
on a Sunday.

192
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:06,903
We want to help.
Anything we can do.

193
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:13,526
Oh. So all this
is your dad's, huh?

194
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,028
And his friend --
Randy Baxter.

195
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:17,697
They own the place
together now.

196
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:18,865
Uh..."Now"?

197
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,700
Well,
since Dale died.

198
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:22,035
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

199
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:25,204
You think I just come in late
whenever I want?

200
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,255
I'm sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

201
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,257
The, uh, "charming"
Randy Baxter.

202
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,742
- Mm.
- Tell you what --

203
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,312
congratulations. You're headed
for the graveyard shift.

204
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:36,149
Be one second late,
and you're fired.

205
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:37,517
Yes, sir.

206
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,637
He's actually
a really nice guy.

207
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:44,524
It's just not easy
being the axman.

208
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:46,092
So true.

209
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,145
My comrades got you covered,
so if you'll excuse me.

210
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:52,264
Uh, yeah,
I'll go with you.

211
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:55,234
Mr. Mcann?

212
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:57,603
Uh, we'll be brief.
I promise.

213
00:10:57,621 --> 00:10:59,956
Mr. Mcann, is there
any reason to believe

214
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,591
your sons may have
had enemies?

215
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,694
We were told they were
animal attacks.

216
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,996
We just need to explore
every possibility.

217
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,682
They got lots
of friends.

218
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:11,250
No.

219
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:13,086
Well, do they work here
with you? Like Marie does.

220
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,737
Could someone
have been jealous?

221
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:17,423
N-no.
Marie's the only one.

222
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,759
Okay -- no.
Th-- there's no...Uh...

223
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:22,428
Jim. It's okay.
It's okay.

224
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:25,098
Let him get some rest.
I'll answer your questions.

225
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:26,349
Of course.

226
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:32,138
I'm just worried
about my dad.

227
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:34,640
He blamed himself
when Dale died, and now this.

228
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:36,275
Why did he
blame himself?

229
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:37,977
Well,
Dale was sensitive.

230
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:40,613
But what do you do --
watch them 24/7?

231
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:43,699
You can't blame
Dale's friends.

232
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:46,202
But your dad
still feels bad.

233
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:48,588
And it doesn't help
Dale's wife is suing us.

234
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:50,456
Really? Why?

235
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,608
She's angry and grieving,
and this is America?

236
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:56,662
I knew Ray and Trevor.

237
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,482
Hell, I'm godfather to all four
of Jim's kids.

238
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:01,384
Ray and Trevor
loved their fun,

239
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:03,219
but they'd never do
anything crazy.

240
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,987
No rugrats of your own?

241
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:06,105
Just Jim's.

242
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,808
They'd borrow my car,
raid my fridge.

243
00:12:08,842 --> 00:12:11,060
Now, the two of you started this
company with a third partner.

244
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:12,111
Right?

245
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:14,680
Yeah. Dale.

246
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:18,234
He passed away
a few months ago.

247
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:20,153
Passed away
in the woods or...?

248
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:22,155
He took his own life.

249
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:24,073
Oh. Sorry.

250
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:26,659
Well, he had problems
for a long time.

251
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:28,527
Look, this is
just a nightmare.

252
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:29,745
First Dale, now this.

253
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:31,714
This was gonna be
our big year.

254
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:33,800
We're selling Thighslapper

255
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:36,652
to one of the largest
distributors in the U.S.

256
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:39,205
It's been in the works
for months.

257
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:41,757
News is gonna hit public
pretty soon.

258
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,643
Well, that's
the brass ring, huh?

259
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:45,027
Given other circumstances,

260
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:47,280
yeah, we'd be celebrating
right about now.

261
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:06,165
That looks great,
sweetie.

262
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,701
Hello?

263
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,536
- There's grandpa.
- Hi.

264
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:21,080
Oops.

265
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:25,251
I'll get some snacks.
You should eat.

266
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:26,636
Sit, Dad.

267
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:32,191
Hey,
what you drawing?

268
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:34,477
My world.

269
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:36,812
Hmm.

270
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:20,239
What is it, sweetie?

271
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:34,370
What is it?

272
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,295
Lillian!

273
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:58,440
There's a million things with
claws go bump in the night.

274
00:14:58,442 --> 00:15:00,827
Once you throw in "invisible,"
the number goes down.

275
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:05,898
"Afternoon Delights"?

276
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:07,667
Really, Garth?

277
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:09,002
Don't you think this place
is a little, uh...

278
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:10,503
Uh,
you want a nice hot tub

279
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,138
after a day
at the office.

280
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,489
It's the little things.

281
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:17,877
I feel sad
for those brewery dudes.

282
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:20,546
Spend your life beautifying
the world through beer.

283
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:23,049
First a partner
offs himself.

284
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:25,985
Now two kids get ganked
by unknown freakadeek.

285
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,820
According to this,
Dale wasn't just a partner.

286
00:15:27,855 --> 00:15:29,172
He was also the brewmaster.

287
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:31,107
"Brewmaster"?

288
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:32,158
He was widely considered
a genius.

289
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:35,161
All right, that's it.

290
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:37,618
No microbrew is worth...

291
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:38,509
...What was it --

292
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:39,734
eight <i>Food Magazine</i> awards?

293
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:44,537
Beer's not food.
It's...whatever water is.

294
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:51,744
Hmm.
Thighslapper.

295
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,135
Wow,
that's actually awesome.

296
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:00,803
Damn it,
I'm not even mad anymore.

297
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:20,606
Wow.
Party on, Garth.

298
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:22,658
I don't even
usually drink beer.

299
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,877
It messes with
my depth perception.

300
00:16:27,414 --> 00:16:30,066
Especially
when I skinny-dip.

301
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:33,503
Hey, you guys
want to hear a joke?

302
00:16:33,554 --> 00:16:35,671
Listen to this.
This is something interesting.

303
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,528
Garth,
are you drunk?

304
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:44,847
Dude, I just...
drank a whole beer.

305
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:46,249
Of course I'm drunk.

306
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:50,136
"Something interesting."

307
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:51,270
Right. Uh...

308
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:52,739
Hey, can I have
some more Thighslapper?

309
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:55,525
No.
No. Coffee for you, Tara Reid.

310
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:56,943
Coffee with kalh?a
in it?

311
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:59,979
So, it says that Dale
actually left the company

312
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:01,514
two weeks before he died.

313
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:04,867
Or...maybe he got pushed out
'cause he didn't want to sell.

314
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:07,203
I mean, Baxter said the deal's
been in the works for months.

315
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:10,289
That would explain the widow.
She's suing.

316
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:13,126
Maybe Dale had a bone to pick,
and he's still picking it.

317
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,081
Right. So, maybe
he's a spirito malo.

318
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:21,717
<i>Unit to Mcann residence.</i>
<i>698 Washburn.</i>

319
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:24,003
"Mcann residence,"
as in Jim Mcann?

320
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:25,638
As in,
let's hope for their sake

321
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:27,723
our spirito ain't
made it out of the woods.

322
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:29,442
All right.

323
00:17:29,476 --> 00:17:30,943
Let's go check it.

324
00:17:30,978 --> 00:17:33,396
Uh, you two go.
I'm gonna visit the widow.

325
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,084
- So?
- Place is clean.

326
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:41,871
My EMF is a nada.
So is this one.

327
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:43,623
Is that mine?
Yeah.

328
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:44,740
I borrowed it
in case mine's broke.

329
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:45,741
Oh.

330
00:17:45,793 --> 00:17:47,743
So, uh...

331
00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:49,662
we still
on invisible werewolf?

332
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:52,031
Maybe, maybe not.
I can't get Tess to talk.

333
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:54,333
But I get the feeling
she saw something.

334
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,806
I'm gonna take a run
at her.

335
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,307
- A what?
- Trust me.

336
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:03,976
My special lady
has twins.

337
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:05,311
Mr. Mcann?

338
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:07,263
"Special lady."

339
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:08,931
Do you mind if we speak
to Tess alone for just a sec?

340
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:11,150
It would really help.

341
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,352
Honey, we'll...

342
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:15,154
We'll be right out there,
okay?

343
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:19,725
Thanks.

344
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:24,530
Hi, Tess.

345
00:18:24,564 --> 00:18:26,916
You want to tell me
what you saw tonight?

346
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:34,674
Or maybe
you'll talk to...

347
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,958
...Mr. Fizzles!

348
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:37,460
I'm your friend!

349
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:39,879
Yay!!

350
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:42,915
Garth. Why don't we put
the sock away?

351
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,885
Mr. Fizzles
wants to help Tess.

352
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,688
He wants to listen.

353
00:18:48,722 --> 00:18:50,640
Mr. Fizzles is gonna go
where the sun don't shine.

354
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:56,546
It was a monster.

355
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:00,066
I believe you, Tess.

356
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,385
Did it have claws?

357
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:05,955
How come you were the only one
that could see it, Tess?

358
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:12,828
What else, Tess?

359
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:18,334
You sure?

360
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:21,837
'Cause Mr. Fizzles can sense
when you're being a...

361
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:25,624
...liar.

362
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,793
All right.
That's -- that's enough...

363
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:29,011
Mr. Fizzles.

364
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:30,696
I drank
a grown-up drink.

365
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:35,585
Uh, grown-up like,
uh, coffee?

366
00:19:36,937 --> 00:19:39,255
Well,
you mean alcohol?

367
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:40,773
It was an accident.

368
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:43,743
Don't let them arrest me,
Mr. Fizzles.

369
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:50,099
Your husband did a lot
of traveling, huh?

370
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:53,119
He went to all kinds
of exotic places

371
00:19:53,153 --> 00:19:54,620
for the best
ingredients.

372
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:57,823
Right. I've tried his work.
It's -- it's great.

373
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:01,761
Um, I hear you're not exactly
on the best of terms

374
00:20:01,795 --> 00:20:03,112
with Dale's old partners.

375
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:05,765
Well, they sold his company
right out from under him.

376
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:08,801
It's not about money.
It's about...

377
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:11,654
It was his baby,
you know?

378
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:14,156
You sound pretty upset
about it.

379
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:18,010
I'm furious.
I hate them.

380
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:20,663
But then I think
how Dale was.

381
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:21,964
What do you mean?

382
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:26,235
His friends left him behind,
but you know what he said?

383
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:29,071
"I'm gonna send them a gift
that shows I forgive them."

384
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:31,507
Do you have any idea
what he sent them?

385
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,677
Bottle of saki.
From one of his trips.

386
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:39,849
In a...gorgeous box
with writing.

387
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:43,502
He was so careful with it.
Wouldn't let me touch it.

388
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:44,920
So, kid in the woods

389
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:47,539
sees something
that nobody else does.

390
00:20:47,557 --> 00:20:49,342
Then Tess sees a monster,
and Jim doesn't.

391
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:51,344
What's the thread?

392
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:53,346
Hmm.

393
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,216
Well, certain mutants
see infrared.

394
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:03,055
"Grown-up drinks."

395
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:04,323
Tess chugged her mom's,

396
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:06,192
and vic number one
was plastered.

397
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:07,677
Right.

398
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,695
So...

399
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,030
Whoa.

400
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:13,032
Monster you got to be drunk
to see.

401
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,566
Cool!

402
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:18,037
Also...hard to fight.

403
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:24,460
Ahh.
Just getting in the zone.

404
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:26,128
You are strictly
on wine coolers.

405
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:28,798
Hey, I love those.
Anything sweet.

406
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:32,018
Whoo!

407
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:36,772
So, uh, what's with
the Grody flask anyway?

408
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:37,890
Lucky charm?

409
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:39,525
It's Bobby's.

410
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:43,479
No microbrew is worth --
what was it -- eight...

411
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:49,201
Really?

412
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:50,769
'Cause, um...

413
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:53,322
You think
there's a possibility

414
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:55,875
that Bobby's
riding your wave?

415
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:57,376
No, we gave him
a hunter's wake.

416
00:21:57,411 --> 00:21:59,545
Yeah, I-I burned
my cousin Brandon,

417
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:01,213
and he stayed stuck.

418
00:22:01,248 --> 00:22:03,165
And -- and --
and they got ghosts in India,

419
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:04,783
and they cremate everybody
over there.

420
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:06,836
It's just instinct,

421
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:08,671
but maybe there <i>is</i> EMF
around here.

422
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:10,172
It just ain't the job.

423
00:22:10,223 --> 00:22:12,258
All right, we're not gonna talk
about this, okay?

424
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:13,342
Not in the middle of work.

425
00:22:13,393 --> 00:22:14,626
Sorry.

426
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:19,098
Just hope that fire
did the trick.

427
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:22,468
Hey, Sam.

428
00:22:22,486 --> 00:22:24,970
Yeah. Got it.
We're on our way.

429
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:48,327
Here it is.

430
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:05,177
Oh.
Wait a second.

431
00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:08,230
Someone's been sampling
the goods.

432
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:09,782
Oh, you don't say?

433
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:13,619
Hey, check it out.

434
00:23:15,288 --> 00:23:17,006
God, I love
paranoid people.

435
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,724
See if you can get on.

436
00:23:24,414 --> 00:23:25,898
Okay. Uh...

437
00:23:35,842 --> 00:23:37,143
All right, so,
first death was, what,

438
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:39,645
four months ago?
Yeah?

439
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,947
Mm-hmm, and, uh, Trevor Mcann.
Patient zero.

440
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:44,183
So, what did he
let out of that bottle?

441
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:55,444
Nothing there.

442
00:23:56,713 --> 00:24:00,199
That we can see.

443
00:24:09,242 --> 00:24:10,693
What, are you kidding me?

444
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:12,094
Tick-tock.

445
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:15,347
Ugh.

446
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:18,017
I mean, can you even
get drunk anymore?

447
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:21,387
It's kind of like drinking
a vitamin for you, right?

448
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:23,389
Shut up.

449
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:24,540
Holy...

450
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:52,918
- All right. Party time.
- Okay.

451
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:54,220
Rewind and go.

452
00:25:04,564 --> 00:25:06,348
So, he -- he let that thing
out of the box,

453
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:08,601
and it must have just
followed him

454
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:10,536
to the place
with all the thingies.

455
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,855
Yes. Yes.

456
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:15,190
That's smart.

457
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:17,743
I'm actually kind of drunk.

458
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:19,361
What is this?

459
00:25:19,412 --> 00:25:21,530
Me likey.

460
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:22,865
I miss these talks.

461
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:25,751
What the hell?!

462
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,154
- Oh, man.
- Uh...

463
00:25:29,172 --> 00:25:30,472
Turn it off.
Turn it off.

464
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:31,823
FBI, huh?
You know what?

465
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:33,292
You can save it for the cops.

466
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:35,878
Mr. Baxter, listen. If you just
let us explain, you --

467
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:38,297
aah!

468
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,470
911.
What's your emergency?

469
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:46,639
Hello?
Do you need assistance?

470
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:50,763
"Anata ga marou mono...

471
00:25:50,797 --> 00:25:52,932
Wa anata ka
ra mo morau."

472
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:57,902
It says, "what you took
will be taken from you."

473
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,971
Like, eye for an eye.

474
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:01,656
You with me?

475
00:26:02,892 --> 00:26:06,545
"Kono bin niwa

476
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:11,183
syoujou zuke no sake
ga hu-in sarete iru."

477
00:26:11,217 --> 00:26:12,384
Where'd you guys
get this anyway?

478
00:26:12,418 --> 00:26:15,387
Why? Is there, uh,
something the matter?

479
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:17,022
Well, you're not superstitious,
are you?

480
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:18,306
Not at all.

481
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:19,674
No, no.

482
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:23,361
Because...this says the bottle
inside contains a Shojo.

483
00:26:23,396 --> 00:26:25,914
What's a...Shojo?

484
00:26:25,948 --> 00:26:27,132
An alcohol spirit.

485
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:31,720
Look, it's just an old myth.
I wouldn't worry about it.

486
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:34,539
But they are not known
for being friendly.

487
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:39,327
I got to go.

488
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:41,329
Oh. Uh, hey...
There you go.

489
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,714
Thank you.
Thank you.

490
00:26:42,748 --> 00:26:44,649
Yeah.
Take care.

491
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:57,229
Garth.

492
00:26:58,648 --> 00:27:00,765
Where's Baxter?

493
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,102
Dude's a lot heavier
than he looks, F.Y.I.

494
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:05,437
But here.

495
00:27:05,471 --> 00:27:07,472
Thought you might
want this back.

496
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,076
You have the C.E.O. of the
douchiest microbrew in the U.S.

497
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,944
gagged in your hot tub?

498
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:14,479
You really think
that's gonna end well?

499
00:27:14,497 --> 00:27:16,248
I'm not feeling
the love.

500
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:18,483
All right. Shojo.

501
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,868
Uh,
let's see what we can see.

502
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,703
What's Shojo?

503
00:27:21,754 --> 00:27:23,821
Japanese booze monster.

504
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,625
I guess that <i>would</i> explain why
you got to be drunk to see it.

505
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:28,727
Very poetic.

506
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:36,401
Ooh. Creepy.

507
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:38,520
Okay. So,
a Shojo is said to roam

508
00:27:38,554 --> 00:27:40,305
where there's lots
of alcohol.

509
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:42,574
There's lore saying that,
back in the old day,

510
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:43,959
if you were plastered enough,

511
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:46,912
you could see one skulking
around the breweries in Japan.

512
00:27:46,946 --> 00:27:49,264
Yeah, but why is this one
shredding brewers' kids?

513
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:51,550
Apparently, you can harness
the will of a Shojo

514
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:52,901
with the right
spell box.

515
00:27:52,952 --> 00:27:54,870
Then you basically have
an attack dog

516
00:27:54,904 --> 00:27:56,299
that you can sic on
whatever sort of personal

517
00:27:56,324 --> 00:27:57,624
revenge mission you want.

518
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,824
So Dale nabs one
to punish his pals.

519
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:01,343
Send the bottle, sooner or later
it's popped open.

520
00:28:01,377 --> 00:28:02,544
Then you have a Shojo

521
00:28:02,578 --> 00:28:03,678
that will do whatever Dale
compelled it to do

522
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:05,196
right here on the box.

523
00:28:05,214 --> 00:28:07,249
Wait.

524
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,634
Except it's not killing the
people that screwed him over.

525
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:11,613
Well, Dale's widow said
the company was his baby.

526
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:13,922
So, if he really wanted his
friends to feel what he felt...

527
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:15,707
He would take theirs.

528
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:18,009
Well, their kids.
Jim's, anyways.

529
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:19,678
And Baxter
was the godfather.

530
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:21,613
All right,
skip to how do we gank it.

531
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:24,366
Good news.
It <i>is</i> killable.

532
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,367
But...

533
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:27,152
But only
with a samurai sword

534
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:29,220
consecrated
with a shinto blessing.

535
00:28:29,238 --> 00:28:31,339
Well...That's not
a silver lining.

536
00:28:31,374 --> 00:28:33,158
The Shojo already
cleaned house, right?

537
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:35,143
I mean, Marie's
the last target standing, so...

538
00:28:35,177 --> 00:28:37,679
I'll hit the pawn shops and,
uh, look for the sword.

539
00:28:37,713 --> 00:28:38,763
You babysit Marie.

540
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:43,285
Yikes. Sorry.

541
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:47,839
Don't worry about it.

542
00:28:47,873 --> 00:28:50,675
Unless I've got nothing
to be sorry <i>for.</i>

543
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,693
Garth.

544
00:28:51,727 --> 00:28:52,894
What's he talking about?

545
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:55,630
I'm concerned that Bobby
might be haunting you.

546
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:58,082
I brought it up to Dean,
and he shot me down.

547
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,401
Garth!
Leave it alone.

548
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:01,803
- It's okay.
- No, it's far from okay.

549
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:03,655
I've already tried
contacting Bobby.

550
00:29:04,857 --> 00:29:06,725
When that
beer disappeared,

551
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,743
I pulled out
a talking board.

552
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:10,195
Without me?

553
00:29:10,229 --> 00:29:12,063
You know, I figured,
why drag you in...

554
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:14,432
when it's something I could just
put to bed myself.

555
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,401
And?

556
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:18,253
And if he was there,
I'd have told you.

557
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:27,212
Talk about this later.
You follow Marie.

558
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:29,147
Let me borrow your keys.

559
00:29:38,307 --> 00:29:40,342
I'm trying to help you,
Mr. Baxter.

560
00:29:40,393 --> 00:29:42,060
And who the hell are you?

561
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:45,664
Now, I'm confused.

562
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,403
Dale goes to get you all
where it hurts --

563
00:29:51,437 --> 00:29:52,721
the kids.

564
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:55,857
Only, you don't have
any kids.

565
00:29:55,908 --> 00:29:58,576
It still affects me.
Believe me.

566
00:29:58,611 --> 00:30:01,129
You want to tell me
what you're hiding?

567
00:30:01,163 --> 00:30:03,698
Hiding?

568
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:05,033
Tell me this.

569
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:08,887
When was the last time you gave
an employee three chances?

570
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:10,955
- Probably never.
- Exactly.

571
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:12,624
You're the axman, right?

572
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:15,427
Tough job, but, hey,
somebody's got to.

573
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:19,547
So, how come you cut that
slacker janitor so many breaks?

574
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:23,618
Yeah. Well, I googled.

575
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:26,888
Come to find his mother...

576
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:29,774
was your secretary
way back in the day.

577
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:32,811
Of course, you were married
to Mrs. B., so, uh...

578
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:35,780
No way there's anything naughty
there, right?

579
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,618
What do you need to get?

580
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:43,171
It don't matter what Dale
knows about you,

581
00:30:43,205 --> 00:30:46,474
'cause that thing out there
killing the kids -- <i>it</i> knows!

582
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:52,247
It didn't end well
with his mom.

583
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:55,583
She made me swear
never to tell him.

584
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:57,252
Oh.

585
00:30:57,303 --> 00:30:58,803
So much for that.

586
00:30:58,838 --> 00:31:00,188
Where is he?

587
00:31:00,222 --> 00:31:03,591
He's, uh --
he's at the brewery.

588
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:05,143
Working
the graveyard shift.

589
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:09,848
Here.

590
00:31:09,882 --> 00:31:11,983
If you care about that kid at all,

591
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:15,587
don't call the cops
on me just yet.

592
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:42,279
It says
it's best to do this

593
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,565
in a running spring.

594
00:31:44,616 --> 00:31:47,451
Uh, yeah.
I, uh -- I got it.

595
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:49,136
Okay. We good?

596
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,571
I'll do my best.

597
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:51,855
All right.

598
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:54,174
"Shichihukujin..."

599
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:55,743
Go.

600
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:57,911
Oh.

601
00:31:57,962 --> 00:31:59,747
"Hito no teni rori korekara

602
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:03,834
seitoun yakuwari wo hatasu
kono Ken wo tataer."

603
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:06,703
That's it.

604
00:32:06,721 --> 00:32:08,839
Oh.

605
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:12,142
All right.
Uh, thanks. There.

606
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:14,544
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

607
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:19,549
Aah.

608
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:22,686
Hey, Garth.

609
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,988
Dean, Baxter's
got a secret love child!

610
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:26,106
The Shojo might come
for him first!

611
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:27,775
Whoa, slow down!

612
00:32:27,826 --> 00:32:29,443
I'm trying to
save lives here!

613
00:32:29,494 --> 00:32:30,778
Are you drunk?

614
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:33,730
Damn it!

615
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,067
Damn it.

616
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:38,152
Garth?

617
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:41,288
You dropped the phone,
didn't you?

618
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:43,624
Nope.

619
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:46,293
Garth!

620
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,229
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm here.

621
00:32:49,264 --> 00:32:50,531
Where the hell are you?

622
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:53,417
I'm in the brewery.

623
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:16,039
Garth?

624
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:18,509
Dean. It's here.

625
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:30,287
Whoa, whoa, hey!
What the hell?!

626
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:32,856
Come with me if you want to live!
Hey!

627
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:40,514
Yeah.

628
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:42,683
Hey, you good to drive?

629
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:44,201
Uh...

630
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:46,286
Well, get a ride.
It's at the brewery.

631
00:33:46,321 --> 00:33:47,471
What?

632
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:51,158
There's another kid.
Don't think -- move.

633
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,445
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait!

634
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:56,813
Taxi! Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

635
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:57,998
Stop!
Hold on, hold on.

636
00:33:58,032 --> 00:33:59,816
National security!
Please!

637
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:03,253
Thank you, ma'am. Sorry.
Thanks, guys.

638
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:05,088
Okay. Brewery.
Step on it!

639
00:34:05,123 --> 00:34:06,423
What?

640
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:08,292
The brewery! Hurry!

641
00:34:08,326 --> 00:34:09,626
Hurry. Hurry, hurry.
Please?

642
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,279
Uh, yeah, but I like to drive
safe, you know.

643
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:13,347
Dude, what's going on?
Who are you?

644
00:34:13,381 --> 00:34:15,465
I'm the law, son.
Now, follow me.

645
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:17,601
Are you drunk, dude?!
Get away from me!

646
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:21,221
All right. I'll just shoot.
Baxter is your father.

647
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:22,672
Baxter screwed Dale.

648
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,174
Dale roped
this Japanese monster

649
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:25,508
you can only see
when you're drunk,

650
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:27,110
and now it's here
to kill you.

651
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:31,465
Whoa, wait a minute.
Baxter is my father?

652
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,575
What are
you looking at?

653
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:42,692
Damn it, run!

654
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,495
Dude,
there's nothing there!

655
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:18,528
Whoa. Whoa. Easy!

656
00:35:18,562 --> 00:35:19,863
We got to get out of here, man.
It's here!

657
00:35:19,897 --> 00:35:20,864
Where's Garth?

658
00:35:20,898 --> 00:35:21,898
- Who?!
- Garth!

659
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,733
There was a guy --
he got knocked out!

660
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:25,402
Oh. Oh, God.

661
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,670
- Stay behind me. Stay behind me.
- Okay, okay, okay.

662
00:35:26,704 --> 00:35:27,838
What, you can see it?

663
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,007
Yeah. I'm skunked.
Just...

664
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:33,126
Fire exit.
On three. All right?

665
00:35:33,177 --> 00:35:34,411
Okay.

666
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:38,098
Okay.
So much for that.

667
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:46,773
Aah!
Get back!

668
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:05,709
Where is it?!
S-swing right!

669
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:08,211
<i>My</i> right.

670
00:36:08,246 --> 00:36:09,246
3:00, Dean!

671
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:14,001
6:00!

672
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:37,974
You okay?

673
00:36:37,992 --> 00:36:39,776
I'm alive?

674
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,478
- Yeah.
- Sam?

675
00:36:41,496 --> 00:36:42,529
Yeah.

676
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,530
Where's Garth?

677
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:45,482
Well, he's --
he's over this way.

678
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,700
Could you go get him?

679
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:49,036
All right.

680
00:37:04,535 --> 00:37:06,603
What'd I miss?

681
00:37:06,637 --> 00:37:09,356
This moved.

682
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:14,677
Bobby?

683
00:37:16,731 --> 00:37:18,415
Are you here?

684
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:23,754
Come on, do <i>something.</i>

685
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:35,358
You sure you guys
don't want to hang out?

686
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:38,828
Grab some brunch,
maybe some brews?

687
00:37:38,862 --> 00:37:40,330
Tempting but, uh,
we better roll.

688
00:37:42,366 --> 00:37:43,549
All right, well...

689
00:37:47,388 --> 00:37:50,089
Oh. Yeah.

690
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:52,708
Call me anytime.

691
00:37:52,726 --> 00:37:54,844
All right.
And you, Sam.

692
00:37:54,878 --> 00:37:56,012
Yeah.

693
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:57,430
Aw, come here.

694
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:59,148
Uh...yeah.

695
00:37:59,183 --> 00:38:01,351
Thanks, Garth.

696
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:05,855
Sayonara, kemo sabes!

697
00:38:07,825 --> 00:38:09,926
Nice ride.

698
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:17,133
You're right.

699
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,669
He has grown on me.

700
00:38:19,703 --> 00:38:22,322
? Poison ?

701
00:38:22,356 --> 00:38:23,640
? poison ?

702
00:38:23,674 --> 00:38:25,308
? poison ?

703
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:29,862
All right. Um...
So, let's talk about it.

704
00:38:30,335 --> 00:38:31,718
About what?

705
00:38:31,753 --> 00:38:34,822
Oh. The, uh,
talking board?

706
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:36,340
That's fine.
I get it, I guess.

707
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:37,674
No. Not that.

708
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:40,193
Look, I heard you.

709
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:41,528
Heard me what?

710
00:38:41,546 --> 00:38:43,764
What happened
in the brewery, Dean?

711
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,985
Nothing. It was, uh --
it was just my imagination.

712
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:49,970
Dean...

713
00:38:50,004 --> 00:38:52,038
Look, I know
something happened.

714
00:38:52,056 --> 00:38:54,475
I just want you to be straight
with me.

715
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:58,429
The blade was across the room,
and then it was in my hand.

716
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,930
And then my beer
drank itself.

717
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:02,816
Oh, and then, that page
magically appeared on the bed.

718
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:04,601
And -- and then Bobby's book
feel down,

719
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:07,104
and out popped the number
of the guy who found Cass.

720
00:39:07,155 --> 00:39:08,939
Nothing, I'm sure.

721
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,223
Clearly.

722
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:11,992
Well, then, what, Sam?

723
00:39:12,026 --> 00:39:13,777
Is Bobby here or not?!

724
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:15,496
You know what I think,
Dean?

725
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,230
I think that
regular people,

726
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,500
they see ones they lost
everywhere, too.

727
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:21,034
Yeah. Freaking ghosts!

728
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,170
Or they just
miss them a lot.

729
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:24,955
I mean, they see a face
in the crowd --

730
00:39:25,006 --> 00:39:26,206
we see a book
falling off the table.

731
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,458
Same thing, Dean.

732
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:30,043
I mean, I did the talking board.
I ran plenty of EMF.

733
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:33,079
When that beer went poof,
I went a little nuts.

734
00:39:33,097 --> 00:39:36,049
Yeah, and why
didn't you tell me?

735
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,784
Like I said,
little nuts at the time.

736
00:39:39,354 --> 00:39:41,421
All right,
well, if it wasn't Bobby,

737
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:43,757
then what Jedi'd that sword
into my hand?

738
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:46,760
The Shojo slammed the door
from across the room.

739
00:39:46,778 --> 00:39:49,413
Maybe it was trying
to grab the sword, too.

740
00:39:52,617 --> 00:39:54,768
Right.

741
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:56,537
Right, I mean,
if it was Bobby,

742
00:39:56,571 --> 00:39:57,771
he would let us know.

743
00:39:57,789 --> 00:39:59,439
I mean, who knows more about
being a ghost than Bobby?

744
00:39:59,457 --> 00:40:01,742
Instant Swayze, right?

745
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:03,610
Exactly.

746
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:05,245
Okay.

747
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:09,082
Okay, so your theory is
that -- that we're practically

748
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,718
regular people
about something for once.

749
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:14,338
All right.

750
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:17,508
Well, you want to grab
some brunch and some brews?

751
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:19,676
Ugh, no.
I'm <i>so</i> hung over.

752
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:21,595
Let's just hit the road.
All right.

753
00:40:44,502 --> 00:40:46,603
Hang on.

754
00:40:56,798 --> 00:40:59,066
There you are.

755
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,976
I'm right here,
you idjit!

756
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:20,786
Balls!
