00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:02,883
- Hello.
- Bobby singer?

2
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:05,038
My surgeon is a monster

3
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:07,575
please get your ass here to,
sioux falls general hospital.

4
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:10,116
They're like
shapeshifters,

5
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:12,452
only a lot more
into eatin' folk.

6
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:15,223
And...Nothing
can kill 'em.

7
00:00:16,703 --> 00:00:18,179
Anything else?

8
00:00:18,247 --> 00:00:20,584
Yep.
They bleed black goo.

9
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:23,396
Hi, Dean.

10
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:32,144
The spell only lasts
for a few days.

11
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:34,478
The stuff you don't talk about
doesn't just go away.

12
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:36,077
What the hell
are you talking about?

13
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:37,875
I'm talking about whatever
you're not telling me about!

14
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:42,700
We're good. Right?

15
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:44,518
We're good.

16
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,962
You sure about this?

17
00:00:56,831 --> 00:00:58,332
Trust me.

18
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:09,643
Good morning...
Megan.

19
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,999
That is a really,
really pretty dress.

20
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:11,896
Oh!

21
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:14,181
Thank you.
It's vintage.

22
00:01:14,232 --> 00:01:15,616
Well, it looks new
on you.

23
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:16,784
Aren't you sweet, sir?

24
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:18,035
Call me Dean.

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,288
How can I help you today,
Dean?

26
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:24,291
Um, well, I don't actually
have an account at this bank,

27
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,693
but I was wondering
if there was any way...

28
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:28,295
I could get change
for that?

29
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:29,964
I think I can make
an exception...

30
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:31,048
Just for you.

31
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,917
Thanks.

32
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:39,390
How do you want it, Dean?

33
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,310
Well, I'm gonna have
to take a rain check...

34
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:44,929
And all your money.

35
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:52,103
Hands in the air!
Hands in the air!

36
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,560
Your money's insured,
so no heroes, okay?

37
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:09,170
You ready?

38
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:10,204
Yep.

39
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:29,925

41
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:40,868
Okay, Chet.

42
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:44,271
Let's see how you like a little
fruit of the poison tree.

43
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:46,657
Isn't that just
a legal expression?

44
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:48,325
You're gonna wish it was.

45
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,163
Hmm.

46
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:55,216
Oaky.

47
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:57,718
Similar finish
to holy water,

48
00:02:57,785 --> 00:03:00,087
not as bitter
as rock salt.

49
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,427
And how are my two
favorite meat-sicles?

50
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,962
Is he still sucking air?

51
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:11,232
Greatest hits
didn't do the trick.

52
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:13,800
I'm down to B-sides
and deep cuts.

53
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:15,802
Well, you better figure out
something quick.

54
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:17,705
That whammy that witch dude
put on him

55
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:18,906
is only gonna last
for a few days.

56
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:20,191
He gets his spinach back,

57
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:21,442
we're gonna end up having
to drop a car on him

58
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,476
just to stop him.

59
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:23,977
Actually...

60
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:26,480
Edgar walked away
from that car.

61
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:28,499
He's fine.

62
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,118
Well, he is a little pissed
at you, but--

63
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:35,506
Oh. You didn't know?

64
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,707
Why don't you shut
your caketrap?

65
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,425
Ooh.

66
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:39,877
Bobby...

67
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,161
You've been using all this stuff
and he still won't talk?

68
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,221
Huddle over, coach?

69
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:52,056
How'd you find us?

70
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,859
It was easy.

71
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,560
I used pattern-recognition
software

72
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:59,146
and a basic heuristic algorithm
to track your known aliases.

73
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,066
Great.
Just what we need --

74
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,684
a Mensa monster.

75
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:07,538
All right.

76
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,373
Let's just start
with the start.

77
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,358
Where'd you get
our aliases?

78
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,745
From your trench-coated friend,
obviously.

79
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:17,331
When we were all nestled in
at Camp Cass,

80
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,617
kind of got
the full download.

81
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:21,502
That's just how we do.

82
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,004
So why <i>are</i> you
talking to us, Chet?

83
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,173
You're not dumb.

84
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,542
Why you spilling
state secrets?

85
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:30,327
'Cause I'm not scared of you.

86
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,830
You can't stop me.

87
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,233
You can't stop any of us.

88
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:40,187
We can't be killed,
you stupid little chewtoys.

89
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,307
You are aware that I'm the least
of your concerns, right?

90
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,245
Oh.

91
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,897
You haven't watched the news
today, have you?

92
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:57,354
<i>The two men, who up until</i>
<i>today were presumed dead,</i>

93
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,456
<i>locked the doors</i>
<i>and opened fire,</i>

94
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,891
<i>leaving no survivors.</i>

95
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,611
<i>Sam and Dean Winchester</i>
<i>are now the subjects</i>

96
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,347
<i>of a manhunt throughout</i>
<i>the state of California.</i>

97
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,185
Busy morning, you two?

98
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:13,304
Those sons of bitches
xeroxed us.

99
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:14,605
But I don't
understand how.

100
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,889
I don't know.

101
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,728
Maybe one of 'em
touched you at the hospital.

102
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,929
It was the hair!

103
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:24,515
Not too hard to lift some DNA

104
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,533
out of a motel
shower drain, guys!

105
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,988
You can copy people
like that?

106
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:32,656
Awesome.

107
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,241
Well, what is their plan,
exactly?

108
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,492
Squeeze us.

109
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:38,579
Turn us into the most wanted men
in America.

110
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,297
All right.
Well, that settles it.

111
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,915
We find these ass monkeys,
and we kill them ourselves.

112
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,183
Wait a sec.

113
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:44,585
Every form of law enforcement
in the country

114
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,253
has seen your ugly mugs
this morning.

115
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,455
Exactly. So what's the point
in trying to hide?

116
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:50,391
Better than sticking
your fool neck out.

117
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,459
These things are smarter
than you.

118
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,927
Geez, Bobby,
don't sugarcoat it.

119
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,080
You don't have a clue
how to kill 'em

120
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,148
or slow 'em down,
and your plan is, what?

121
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,184
Go right at 'em?
Genius.

122
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:02,069
They're wearing our faces,
Bobby. This is personal.

123
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:02,903
I'm with Dean here.

124
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,574
Well,
if you're gonna be stupid,

125
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:09,576
you might as well be smart
about it.

126
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,249
You need to see a fella
named Frank Devereaux.

127
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:16,650
Who's he?

128
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,486
He's a jackass
and a lunatic,

129
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:22,322
but he owes me one,
from back in Port Huron.

130
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,492
In the meantime,

131
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:28,212
I'll keep working
on Chatty Cathy here,

132
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:30,997
see if I can figure out
what makes him die.

133
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:50,984
The usual?

134
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,570
Rhymes with sing-songs.

135
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:57,408
You guys
sell protein bars?

136
00:06:57,492 --> 00:06:59,660
Yeah.

137
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:07,033
But it's in --
it's in the back, though.

138
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:08,052
Just, uh,
give me a second.

139
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,536
Sure. Thanks.

140
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,525
Pretty sure
the cashier just made me.

141
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,576
Drive.

142
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,196
Hell.

143
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,549
Thanks.

144
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,603
Special Agent Morris.
This is Special Agent Valente.

145
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,938
Gentlemen.

146
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,423
These Winchester boys
are keeping busy, I hear.

147
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:05,659
What is this,
some type of psycho road trip?

148
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:09,279
The second bank,
plus that convenience store?

149
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,731
Couple of days ago,
they were dead.

150
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:11,815
We know about
what you know.

151
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,784
Excuse me.

152
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,286
<i>Actual</i> serial killers.

153
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,572
Crime spree means paperwork.
Lots of it.

154
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,773
Which <i>you'll</i> be doing.

155
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:23,327
We gotta go.

156
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:26,330
Winchesters spotted
at a Gas n' Sip.

157
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,298
It's about a thousand miles
from here.

158
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,550
That's fast.

159
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:30,584
Must have flown.

160
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,052
That or Batmobile.

161
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,407
You sure this is
the right place?

162
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:54,825
Yeah.

163
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:07,955
Frank, you in there?

164
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:09,623
Frank?

165
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:14,761
Frank?

166
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:22,219
Frank?

167
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:26,940
Frank, anybody here?

168
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:34,114
Hello?

169
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:37,985
Anybody home?

170
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,075
Well, well.

171
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:48,929
Spider caught some flies.

172
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:06,379
Well, I'll be darned.

173
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,967
Psycho Butch and Sundance.

174
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,585
You're on CNN right now.

175
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:12,970
No, no,
t-that's not us.

176
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:14,555
I know. Can't be.

177
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,973
Unless you had a teleporter.

178
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:19,727
Do you have a teleporter?

179
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:21,478
No...Sir.

180
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:22,513
We don't.

181
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:28,535
Well, my condolences
on the doppelgangers.

182
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:31,605
Now, who sent you?
NSA? The Feeb?

183
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,741
March of Dimes?

184
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:37,828
Uh, Bobby Singer sent us.

185
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:41,031
Or not. Who?

186
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,816
H-he said
you could help.

187
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:44,918
He said you owed him,
from Port Huron.

188
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:50,457
Guy saves your life <i>one</i> time,

189
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:53,460
and, what, you owe him
the rest of yours?

190
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:56,096
That's usually
how it works, yeah.

191
00:11:10,595 --> 00:11:12,729
Oh, yeah.

192
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:15,899
I know that Bobby's
into that magic hooey,

193
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,201
but truth is,

194
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:19,403
the government have been
cloning people for years.

195
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:21,738
Guess it was just your turn
in the barrel.

196
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,457
- Well, actually --
- Forget it. He's rolling.

197
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,375
Yours have been
busy beavers.

198
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:27,944
You're number two
on the most wanted list.

199
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:30,547
Quickest climb up the charts
since Donna Summer.

200
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:33,250
So, what do you think
we should do?

201
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,669
Cuba's nice
this time of year.

202
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:37,387
No, we're not hiding.

203
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:40,757
Is he always this stupid?

204
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:43,640
Look, we got to stick around
and kick a couple asses.

205
00:11:44,596 --> 00:11:47,064
So, we just need you to get us
further off the grid,

206
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:48,649
but keep us on the board.

207
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:53,470
Well, first thing we got to do
is wipe all your old aliases.

208
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:55,472
No more rock shoutouts.

209
00:11:55,523 --> 00:11:58,642
It's Tom and John Smith
from now on.

210
00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:00,027
And no plastic.

211
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:01,328
Cash only.

212
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:03,947
And change your phones
on a very frequent

213
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:06,416
non-schedule schedule,
you understand?

214
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:09,920
Oh, and try to stay out of view
of the 200 million cameras

215
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:12,372
that the government
has access to, 'kay?

216
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:13,340
200 million?

217
00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:14,491
Big Brother,

218
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:15,825
he has many eyeballs,
my friend.

219
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:17,344
You see a place
that even looks like

220
00:12:17,428 --> 00:12:18,795
it can afford security,

221
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:21,798
you just
ease on down the road.

222
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,016
This...

223
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:25,719
This is your laptop,
right?

224
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:27,387
Yeah. That's mine.

225
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:30,524
What -- gee -- hey --

226
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:32,342
what are you --
what was that?!

227
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:37,531
Uh...

228
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:43,987
Thank you, I guess.

229
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:46,123
No problem.
You owe me five grand, cash.

230
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,541
- What?
- What?

231
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,076
Unless you wanna go
comparison shop at the mall,

232
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,460
sweet cheeks.

233
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:51,745
Say hi to the cops for me.

234
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:54,131
Okay.

235
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,552
Let's blue steel you up
some new I.D.,

236
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:01,972
Mr. and Mr. Smith.

237
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:05,542
Whoo!

238
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:07,844
Do it again!
Come on, do it again!

239
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:11,515
So you're just gonna touch me
in the morning,

240
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:12,649
then just walk away?

241
00:13:12,717 --> 00:13:14,184
Are you still talkin'?

242
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:16,103
Aren't you sick
of this yet?

243
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:17,988
You bleed.

244
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:22,993
Black...snot, sure,
but you bleed, you can die.

245
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,579
Sure, sport,
whatever you say.

246
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:27,247
Try the acid again,
why don't you?

247
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:29,583
Poor sap.
You're stumped.

248
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,285
Give it a rest, mouthy.

249
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:32,452
How long
you think these'll hold

250
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:34,087
once the spell wears off,
hmm?

251
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:36,089
Tick tock, old man.

252
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:39,760
I'm gonna really enjoy
eating you,

253
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:40,961
right down to that hat.

254
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:42,179
I said shut up.

255
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,881
And then I'm gonna
eat everyone...

256
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,600
you ever said hello to.

257
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:52,439
Hot damn.

258
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:54,308
Well, that's somethin'.

259
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:59,062
I marked all the towns
your stunt doubles hit

260
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:00,897
so you can see
the pattern.

261
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:02,098
All right, great.

262
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,067
Um, so,
what is the pattern?

263
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:05,953
No clue, man.
I can't see it.

264
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:07,270
Seems random.

265
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:08,538
Little tip from a pro --

266
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:10,824
there is no such thing
as a random series

267
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:13,043
of robbery murders
by your evil twins.

268
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,496
Well, have yourself some uppers
and look at that some more.

269
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:17,497
Good luck.

270
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:18,915
Thanks, Frank.

271
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:21,885
For what?
Sending you to your death?

272
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:23,887
Your doubles <i>want</i> to be
on "candid camera,"

273
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:25,789
put you
in the line of fire.

274
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,140
Now, I'd lay low,

275
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:29,426
'cause I love life
and its infinite mysteries.

276
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:31,795
But you two want to be dumb,
that's fine.

277
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:34,481
At least have the common sense
to ditch your car.

278
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:37,234
Uh, excuse me.
What?

279
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:38,819
Your doublemints --

280
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:41,938
they're using a car
just like the one outside.

281
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,831
What the...

282
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:16,890
What the hell
are <i>you</i> doing here?

283
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:19,526
You're all charm, Bobby.

284
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,762
So my therapist
keeps telling me.

285
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,030
How'd you find me?

286
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:25,615
I'm a cop, remember?

287
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:27,984
You gonna invite me in?

288
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,185
Well,
you may not want me to.

289
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:30,787
I got one of the big mouths
downstairs.

290
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:33,240
So I won't go downstairs.

291
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:36,743
Mm.

292
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:38,045
I, uh...

293
00:15:40,381 --> 00:15:42,249
I wanted to come
thank you.

294
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,199
Thank me?

295
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,534
Well, yeah...

296
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:46,053
Seeing as they were
fresh out of

297
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:48,004
"thanks for saving me from
liver-eating surgeon" cards

298
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:49,222
at the store.

299
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:52,059
Oh, that.
Just doing my job,

300
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:54,428
which nobody pays me for.

301
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,396
Right.

302
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,065
How you doing, Bobby?

303
00:15:58,149 --> 00:15:59,599
I'm fine.

304
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:01,768
Every day is a gift.

305
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:04,721
Your house
just burned down.

306
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:06,156
As you can see,
I got a roof over me.

307
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:07,657
Bobby!

308
00:16:07,725 --> 00:16:09,976
Let someone be nice to you
for five minutes?

309
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,430
Okay.

310
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:16,249
But not <i>too</i> nice.

311
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:17,734
I can't be going soft.

312
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:20,420
'Course not.

313
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:22,405
I can cook.

314
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:23,874
Ish. You know?

315
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,408
Why don't you
let me make you something?

316
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,796
Maybe put this new place
of yours in some kind of order.

317
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:31,298
Come on.

318
00:16:31,382 --> 00:16:32,966
I owe you that much.

319
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,853
Okay.
Thanks, sheriff.

320
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,774
Jody.

321
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:04,831
Did you think
it would be that easy?

322
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,083
No.

323
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:08,668
But it's a start.

324
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,588
Ugh.

325
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:33,944
You okay?

326
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:35,612
You know, it's bad enough

327
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:38,498
that they're ganking people,
wearing our mugs,

328
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,783
but now <i>this?</i>

329
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:42,419
Have us driving around
in this...caboodle

330
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:44,087
while Baby's on lockdown.

331
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:45,672
It's temporary, Dean.

332
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:48,458
Nobody puts Baby
in a corner.

333
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:50,794
Y-you know
that's a line from --

334
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:53,430
Swayze movie.
Swayze always gets a pass!

335
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:54,631
Right.

336
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:57,667
Uh, well, you want some tunes
or something?

337
00:17:57,718 --> 00:17:59,970
Here.

338
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:03,390
? <i>And what would you say</i>
<i>if I called on you now</i> ?

339
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,508
? <i>and said that</i>
<i>I  can't hold on?</i> ?

340
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,644
- Sorry, man, I-I...
- Just leave it.

341
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,679
Probably gonna be
the only thing on.

342
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,315
? <i>There's no easy way,</i>
<i>it gets harder each day</i> ?

343
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:16,286
? <i>please love me</i>
<i>or I'll be gone</i> ?

344
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:18,405
? <i>I'll be gone</i> ?

345
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:20,907
? <i>I'm all out of love</i> ?

346
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:23,159
? <i>I'm so lost without you</i> ?

347
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:24,661
? <i>I know you were right</i> ?

348
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:27,547
? <i>believing for so long</i> ?

349
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:29,382
? <i>I'm all out of love</i> ?

350
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:31,835
? <i>what am I without you?</i> ?

351
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:38,174
? <i>I can't be too late to say</i>
<i>that I was so wrong</i> ?

352
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,929
? <i>oh</i> ?

353
00:18:43,014 --> 00:18:47,350
? <i>what are you thinking of?</i> ?

354
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,318
? <i>what are you --</i> ?

355
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:00,897
- Dean.
- What?

356
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:03,166
Jericho --
the lady in white.

357
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:12,259
Blackwater -- wendigo.

358
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:14,094
Lake Manitoc --
the kid in the lake.

359
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:20,300
They're hitting towns
we've worked jobs in.

360
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:21,518
In order.

361
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:23,303
Since the day I left Stanford
with you.

362
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:25,972
So, what,
they <i>want</i> us to find them?

363
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:28,758
Well,
one way to find out --

364
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:30,894
next case would be
in...St. Louis.

365
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:33,480
Perfect.
Connor's Diner.

366
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:35,431
Best burgers
in St. Louis.

367
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:38,485
Oh, I deserve something good
in my life right now.

368
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:50,580
You know,
he has one of these every day.

369
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:52,215
And in his heart,

370
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:55,618
he thinks they're almost
as good as sex.

371
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,787
This...

372
00:19:57,838 --> 00:19:59,589
is disgusting.

373
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:04,460
Dead plants
with creamy goo.

374
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:07,814
It's like eating
self-righteousness.

375
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:09,099
I mean,
you tell me which is worse.

376
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,400
I mean, honestly, I just...
You know what?

377
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:11,434
I can't stand the guy.

378
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:13,987
Talk about a hero complex.

379
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:15,822
And he doesn't have
relationships.

380
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:17,974
No, he has applications
for sainthood.

381
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:19,409
Oh, and he thinks
he's funny.

382
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:21,328
He thinks
he's a damn comedian.

383
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:24,480
Who has two thumbs and
full-blown bats in the belfry?

384
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:25,815
I'm serious.

385
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:28,151
It's nothing but Satan-vision
on the inside.

386
00:20:28,202 --> 00:20:29,819
I mean, how he's walking around
in a jacket

387
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,505
with detachable arms
is beyond me.

388
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:36,209
You know, I had a brother
with this many issues once.

389
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:37,711
- Yeah?
- Know what I did?

390
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:38,628
- Hmm?
- I ate him.

391
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:40,496
Of course you did.

392
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:41,848
How are these guys
even a threat?

393
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:43,466
Boss says they gotta go,
they gotta go.

394
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:44,601
Right.

395
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:45,735
Idea.

396
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:47,503
You wanna trade?

397
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:49,556
I mean, I'll take chuckles
over schizo.

398
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:53,843
No, I like this one's
hair better.

399
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:55,445
You can stay
in the big one.

400
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:57,981
All right. In that case,
let's turn up the heat.

401
00:20:58,032 --> 00:21:00,033
The sooner I get out of this
and into something more stable,

402
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:01,151
the better.

403
00:21:02,653 --> 00:21:03,737
Hold on.

404
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:06,289
Hey, kid. Hey.

405
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:07,407
Why don't you fire up
the camera on that thing?

406
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:11,211
Point it over here.

407
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:15,698
Shall we?

408
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:19,219
All right, everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

409
00:21:19,303 --> 00:21:20,687
Anybody moves,

410
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:22,972
and I'll execute
every last one of you!

411
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:39,032
Choppin' their heads off
won't kill 'em,

412
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,117
but it'll slow 'em down
pretty good.

413
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,902
Till they fuse back up,
anyhow.

414
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,420
Well, that's something,
I guess.

415
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:46,539
I mean, assuming we can even
get close to them.

416
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,342
Believe me, I don't want you
walking right up to 'em, either.

417
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,928
I'm still looking for something
you can shoot at 'em.

418
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:54,213
Good times.
All right, thanks, Bobby.

419
00:21:54,264 --> 00:21:56,432
Hey, you take mayo,
right, Bobby?

420
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:57,917
You got a chick
over there?

421
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,252
What?

422
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,553
No.

423
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:03,089
Are you even working,
Richard Gere?

424
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,524
Shut up, you idjit.

425
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:07,593
Where are you boys
off to next?

426
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:09,195
Uh, St. Louis.
That's where we --

427
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:10,196
It's too late.

428
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:11,381
They hit St. Louis.

429
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:13,566
Pumpkin-and-Honeybunny'd
a diner there.

430
00:22:13,617 --> 00:22:14,984
Connor's Diner?

431
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,819
Yeah.
How'd you know?

432
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:20,039
Lucky guess.

433
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:21,290
All right,
so much for that.

434
00:22:21,358 --> 00:22:22,325
I guess we're off to...

435
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:24,627
To Ankeny, Iowa.

436
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:26,879
Call us if you get
anything else.

437
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:28,748
You got it.

438
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:44,397
Special Agents Morris,
Valente.

439
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,183
You were first
on the scene?

440
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:48,818
Unfortunately.

441
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:50,019
Wanna tell us
what happened?

442
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:06,869
<i>Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>
<i>Keep that up!</i>

443
00:23:06,954 --> 00:23:08,705
<i>I didn't say</i>
<i>you could put that down!</i>

444
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,707
<i>I want the whole world to know</i>

445
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,342
<i>what Sam and Dean Winchester</i>
<i>are capable of.</i>

446
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:19,382
<i>That all of 'em?</i>

447
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:23,169
<i>All but one.</i>

448
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,470
<i>No, please, no.</i>

449
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:34,731
<i>Well,</i>
<i>goodnight, St. Louis.</i>

450
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:37,183
<i>You've been</i>
<i>a wonderful crowd.</i>

451
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:39,351
<i>Grab your socks and hose,</i>
<i>Iowa,</i>

452
00:23:39,403 --> 00:23:41,487
<i>'cause we're</i>
<i>headed to you next.</i>

453
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,190
We need to alert --

454
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:46,743
Federal, state, local --
I'm on it.

455
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,134
Ooh.

456
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,065
Does this skin
make me look fat?

457
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:12,635
Balls.

458
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:16,355
It's pretty dark in here.

459
00:24:16,406 --> 00:24:18,390
High-school dropout.

460
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:21,694
A drunk like your daddy
before you.

461
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:25,414
Oh. You and dad.

462
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:27,566
Now, that's a can
of scorpions.

463
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:32,404
Your favorite singer
is Joni frickin' Mitchell?

464
00:24:32,456 --> 00:24:34,257
Oh, Bobby.

465
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:38,628
You are 10 pounds of sad
in a 5-pound bag.

466
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:52,091
Sam, Sam. Hold up.

467
00:24:54,978 --> 00:24:56,395
Don't move.
Don't move.

468
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:01,868
Oh, no.

469
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:02,702
This is all sorts
of wrong.

470
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:06,455
Those are nice wheels.

471
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,107
Tell you what,
when this is over,

472
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:09,292
I'm stealing those rims.

473
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:12,662
Tell the kids I said hi.

474
00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:14,130
Yeah.

475
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:15,381
Bobby,
we got eyes on them.

476
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:17,250
What?

477
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:18,251
It's like looking
at a funhouse mirror.

478
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:19,802
Yeah, I know the feeling.

479
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:21,420
All right, well,
tell me you got something.

480
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:23,139
Otherwise, we're gonna
have to get in close.

481
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:25,224
Look,
just hang back for now.

482
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:26,425
It's too late.
We gotta --

483
00:25:26,476 --> 00:25:28,394
hang on.

484
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:29,896
Hands in the air!

485
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:32,798
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Big misunderstanding.

486
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,233
Look, the guys you want --
shut up!

487
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:36,652
They're right there.
Shut up!

488
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,937
Drop the phone.
Put your hands in the air.

489
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:38,938
Dean?

490
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:40,773
Dean!

491
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:50,338
You know the thing
about you, Bobby...

492
00:25:50,363 --> 00:25:51,563
Save it.

493
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:54,136
I already know me,
handsome.

494
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:57,340
You got
the gruff thing down.

495
00:25:57,424 --> 00:26:01,043
Seen more death
than an electric chair.

496
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:04,096
Ready to die
with your boots on.

497
00:26:05,883 --> 00:26:07,767
But, you know,
deep down inside...

498
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,218
you're no cynic.

499
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:11,721
You still hope.

500
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:13,973
You even got a thing
for that lady upstairs.

501
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:16,976
Tiny part of you thinks,

502
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:18,477
maybe...

503
00:26:18,528 --> 00:26:20,897
after this is all done,

504
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:24,033
you and miss sheriff can make
your own little cabin

505
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:25,067
in the woods.

506
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:30,973
That's hilarious.

507
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:34,860
You're not getting any older
than tomorrow, Bobby.

508
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:36,162
Why do you bother?

509
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:39,999
You a Browning fan?

510
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:41,533
Come again?

511
00:26:41,585 --> 00:26:42,718
Robert Browning.

512
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:45,037
Poet.

513
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:47,306
You got that name rattling
around up there

514
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:49,642
with the rest of my thoughts
and feelings?

515
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,644
It's kind of hard
to sift through

516
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,596
all the drunken
blackouts, but --

517
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,499
"A man's reach
should exceed his grasp."

518
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:59,485
I like that.

519
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,387
That's actually lovely.

520
00:27:01,438 --> 00:27:02,855
Browning?

521
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:03,906
After I eat you,

522
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:05,491
I'm definitely gonna hit
the library.

523
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:10,896
What the hell is that?

524
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:13,666
Get it off.

525
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:14,634
Get it off!

526
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:16,235
Get it off!!

527
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:18,237
Get it off of me!

528
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:21,874
Get it off me!

529
00:27:24,928 --> 00:27:26,796
Oh, sorry.
Little snafu here.

530
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:30,099
Mm!

531
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:32,468
Okay, wasn't expecting
<i>that</i> reaction.

532
00:27:32,552 --> 00:27:34,353
What the hell
was in that bucket?

533
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:39,558
Look,
you're making a mistake.

534
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:41,394
The real killers
are back at the diner, okay?

535
00:27:41,445 --> 00:27:42,645
Is that the best
you can do?

536
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:43,863
I want my phone call.

537
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,282
Oh, there'll be a call,
to the FBI.

538
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:47,933
Take him
to cell number one.

539
00:27:47,985 --> 00:27:50,820
Take that one
to the interview room.

540
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:51,871
Once they're separate
and secure,

541
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:53,272
you boys call it a night.

542
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:54,573
You're making a mistake!

543
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:17,796
What, did you guys
forget something or what?

544
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,711
Hey. I have a right
to my phone call.

545
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:33,996
A right?

546
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,998
You killed how many people
last couple days,

547
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,333
and you want me to hop-to
on your rights?

548
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,586
I didn't --

549
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,805
please --

550
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:47,092
just give me one --
one phone call.

551
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:51,647
Boys?

552
00:28:51,714 --> 00:28:53,315
Bobby, we got popped.

553
00:28:53,382 --> 00:28:54,600
Okay.
I'll be there as soon as --

554
00:28:54,684 --> 00:28:56,018
No, no, there's no time.
Look, we saw them...

555
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,719
They saw us.

556
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,988
So, we are coming
to get us.

557
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:01,223
You read me?

558
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:02,357
Tell me
you got something.

559
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,559
There's a chemical --

560
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:05,861
sodium borate.

561
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,329
Okay, let me get Mr. Wizard
on speed dial.

562
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:09,248
No, no,
it ain't as weird as it sounds.

563
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,533
It's found in industrial
cleaners and soaps

564
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:12,918
and laundry powder.

565
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:15,420
Just look for anything
with the word borax on it.

566
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:17,456
You want me to "Desperate Housewife"
these mothers?

567
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,424
No, just trust me.

568
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,261
It burns 'em bad enough
to slow 'em down.

569
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:23,712
So get the strongest
you can find. Hear me?

570
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,664
Borax. Burns.
Got it.

571
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:27,466
Then douse 'em,

572
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,136
then get close,
and then chop the heads off.

573
00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:32,437
Got it.

574
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:34,139
And keep
the heads separate!

575
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:35,641
Bobby, you're a genius.
Thanks. I --

576
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:37,242
what'd you do that for?

577
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,461
Borax?
Decapitation?

578
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:43,482
What kind of sickos are you
and your friends?

579
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:44,650
Hey, you listen to me.

580
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:45,951
If you don't go get
every ounce,

581
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:48,603
every drop of
whatever that stuff is

582
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:50,405
in this place right now...

583
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,007
We're all gonna die!

584
00:29:52,075 --> 00:29:55,494
Well, you're crazier
than I thought.

585
00:29:55,578 --> 00:29:58,580
Hey!

586
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:06,755
What are you doing?

587
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:09,258
What is your problem?

588
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,425
We don't have time for lunch
right now.

589
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,593
I was hungry.

590
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,278
Later. Let's go.

591
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:31,280
What is it?

592
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,814
What happened?

593
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:35,784
I...It's just...

594
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,086
I don't know
what I just saw.

595
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:39,121
Let me out of here.

596
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,792
Okay, you listen to me,
and we'll live.

597
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,594
All right, keep your head down,
get to the supply closet.

598
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:48,496
Get anything that says borax
on it -- bring it here.

599
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:50,549
Now. Go.

600
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,477
Dean!

601
00:31:04,147 --> 00:31:05,013
I'm not your brother.

602
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:09,818
But I am Dean adjacent.

603
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:21,330
Sorry.

604
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,081
Sammy.

605
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:27,202
Not Sammy.

606
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,815
I just want to let you know

607
00:31:39,882 --> 00:31:41,733
how much I've really grown
to hate

608
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,385
you and your brother
since we've been wearing you.

609
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,439
I just don't get it.

610
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:49,057
You could be anything.

611
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:51,410
You're strong.
You're uninhibited.

612
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:54,062
You're smart enough,
believe it or not.

613
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,665
But you're so caught up
in being good

614
00:31:56,732 --> 00:31:58,950
and taking care
of each other.

615
00:31:59,035 --> 00:31:59,785
What do you care?

616
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:01,536
Because it pisses me off!

617
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:08,960
You're wasting
a perfectly good opportunity

618
00:32:09,045 --> 00:32:10,429
to subjugate the weak.

619
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:21,973
Cute. Really think you can
get close enough to use it?

620
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:23,608
Not until you're burning.

621
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:35,251
Here's the deal.

622
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,904
Dean...

623
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:40,491
...thinks you're nutballs.

624
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:41,727
He thinks you're off
your game.

625
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,852
You gonna kill me,
or is this some sort of

626
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,077
"play with your food" bull?

627
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,464
All right.

628
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,501
All right.

629
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:55,455
You know, I guess that's why
Dean never told you

630
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:56,840
that he killed Amy.

631
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,929
There it is.

632
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,182
The look on your face.

633
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:06,934
That is priceless!

634
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,937
That's what
I've been waiting for.

635
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,656
Now I can eat you.

636
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:16,443
'Cause, you see,

637
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,947
I like my meat
a little bitter.

638
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,678
Well, that felt good.

639
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:39,166
So...

640
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,168
the FBI is on the way.

641
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,803
Yeah, listen,
about that...

642
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,304
whatever I can do...

643
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,142
Especially if it involves lying
about everything I just saw.

644
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,526
Good.

645
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:54,364
I was hoping you could help us
kind of...be dead.

646
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,200
You know, quote unquote.

647
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,351
Yeah.

648
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,187
Yeah, I should be able
to swing that.

649
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,072
All right.

650
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:03,157
Come on,
let's grab a mop.

651
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,861
Sammy? You okay?

652
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,534
Yeah, I'm fine.

653
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:15,252
Let's go.

654
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,057
That's when I got the drop
on them

655
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,541
and shot them both.

656
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,876
You did good, sheriff.

657
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,144
Here's the files.

658
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,180
Cause of death --
multiple gunshot wounds.

659
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,881
I fingerprinted them first,
of course,

660
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,016
for your records.

661
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,517
Mind if we take a look
at the bodies?

662
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,437
Their bodies were sent to
the funeral home for cremation,

663
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:35,555
as per their living wills
and religious requirements.

664
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,758
Wow.

665
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,359
That must be
some kind of record.

666
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,777
They died last night.

667
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:43,530
You can contact
the funeral home.

668
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:44,731
They might still have
the bodies.

669
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:45,699
As you know,
once we do the autopsy,

670
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,117
we're obliged to release --

671
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:50,120
You had the bodies
destroyed?

672
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:52,572
What kind of
backwater operation is this?

673
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:54,508
Hey! Easy.
Forget about it.

674
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:57,845
No bodies,
no paperwork, right?

675
00:34:57,912 --> 00:34:59,096
Someone once told me
that was a good thing.

676
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,915
The good news still stands.

677
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,467
This case is closed.

678
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:05,085
Sam and Dean Winchester
are dead.

679
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,280
<i>The Winchester crime spree has</i>
<i>come to a violent end in Iowa,</i>

680
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,365
<i>where they were gunned down.</i>

681
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:21,101
That should take the heat off.
For now.

682
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,319
Thanks, Jody.

683
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:24,821
Couldn't have done it
without you.

684
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:26,540
Anytime you need me
to spill something else,

685
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:27,741
you give me a call.

686
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,744
Actually,
there is one more thing.

687
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:48,312
Don't open it.

688
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,098
Even if it starts talking.

689
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,432
<i>Especially</i>
<i>if it starts talking.</i>

690
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,518
When you cross over
Underhill Bridge,

691
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,103
just toss it
in the drink.

692
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,905
If you'll excuse me,

693
00:35:57,972 --> 00:36:00,457
I, um...I got a body
to bury in cement.

694
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:20,127
Dad, seriously?

695
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,179
Lying to the FBI,
incinerating bodies,

696
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,297
and <i>this</i> stuff?

697
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,881
What the hell is it?

698
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:26,300
'Cause it sure
isn't blood.

699
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,501
You're right about that,
sweetie.

700
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,003
It's much more than blood.

701
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,021
I can explain.

702
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,189
Don't bother.

703
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,598
It's valente.

704
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:05,101
Yes, sir, I'm with them now.

705
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:09,672
Well, unfortunately,
their heads are...

706
00:37:09,723 --> 00:37:11,157
missing.

707
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:13,175
Huh.

708
00:37:13,227 --> 00:37:14,948
But the actual Winchesters
are dead, yes?

709
00:37:14,973 --> 00:37:16,173
No, sir.

710
00:37:16,647 --> 00:37:17,814
They're in the wind.

711
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:19,782
So, all that brainpower,
all those resources,

712
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,068
and those two field mice
are still on my to-do list?

713
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:23,519
I'm sorry, sir.

714
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,872
We could grab some more DNA
and double them again.

715
00:37:25,956 --> 00:37:27,623
I like
where your head's at,

716
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:29,308
but sometimes
less is more.

717
00:37:29,376 --> 00:37:31,828
Those boys coming back
from the dead again

718
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:33,463
starts to strain
credulity,

719
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,865
even for the American media,
am I right?

720
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:36,966
Yes, sir.

721
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:38,885
I like
a subtler approach.

722
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:41,239
Back to the vision board
on this one.

723
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,524
Of course.

724
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:44,193
Just secure the bodies
and get back to the FBI,

725
00:37:44,244 --> 00:37:47,279
and we'll give this Winchester
situation a good think.

726
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:49,380
Definitely.
Thanks, sir.

727
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:51,549
And, Valente?

728
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,100
Next time,
call me with a win.

729
00:37:53,185 --> 00:37:54,235
For your sake.

730
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:55,937
Please don't make me
bib you.

731
00:37:56,021 --> 00:37:58,823
Yes, sir.

732
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:01,526
I'm craving a latte.

733
00:38:01,577 --> 00:38:03,277
You mind running
across the street

734
00:38:03,362 --> 00:38:04,728
before we hit the trail?

735
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,330
Decaf,
two pumps of vanilla,

736
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:08,899
and grab yourself whatever
you want -- my treat.

737
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,678
Mr. Roman.

738
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:22,213
I felt it was time
we met in person.

739
00:38:23,465 --> 00:38:25,183
I'm Crowley.

740
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,834
I run hell.

741
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:29,353
Yes, yes. Of course.
I agree, 100%.

742
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:30,638
High time we met.

743
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,640
A token.

744
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:33,641
You shouldn't have.

745
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:34,775
I love a muffin.

746
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:38,029
100% organic baby uvulas --

747
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:39,430
gluten free.

748
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:40,731
So considerate.

749
00:38:45,237 --> 00:38:47,121
I'll cut to the chase,
Mr. Roman.

750
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:48,406
Please. Dick.

751
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:50,491
Dick.

752
00:38:50,576 --> 00:38:53,110
You and I control
large interests

753
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:55,129
that I feel strongly
could meld,

754
00:38:55,214 --> 00:38:57,048
to the benefit of all.

755
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:59,166
You think?
I know.

756
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:01,419
Straight talk --
we should be friends,

757
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,553
you and I.

758
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:04,305
Why?

759
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:06,157
Why in the world
<i>would</i> we be?

760
00:39:06,225 --> 00:39:08,643
Well,
I brought you here...

761
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:10,411
Dick.

762
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:12,513
I found the way to open
the door to Purgatory.

763
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:14,765
To steal every last soul,
you mean.

764
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:16,667
You and that angel friend
of yours.

765
00:39:16,735 --> 00:39:18,869
Don't roofie me
and call it romance.

766
00:39:18,937 --> 00:39:21,105
I think you've
got me wrong.

767
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:22,490
Now it's <i>your</i> turn
to listen.

768
00:39:24,076 --> 00:39:25,476
I'd sooner swim through
hot garbage

769
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:26,661
than shake hands

770
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:27,778
with a bottom-feeding
mutation like you.

771
00:39:29,698 --> 00:39:34,652
You demons are ugly, lazy,
gold-digging whores.

772
00:39:34,703 --> 00:39:36,754
You're less than humans,

773
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:38,989
and they're not good
for much

774
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,442
till you dip 'em
in garlic sauce.

775
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,594
I'd never work with you,
Crowley.

776
00:39:43,662 --> 00:39:46,097
In fact, if I wasn't busy
with better things,

777
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:48,599
I might actively wipe your kind
from the face of the Universe.

778
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:50,000
And you'd deserve it.

779
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:53,471
Are we clear?

780
00:39:57,776 --> 00:39:59,844
Keep the muffins.

781
00:40:10,322 --> 00:40:12,039
Are you sure you want to dump
these things?

782
00:40:12,124 --> 00:40:14,458
I'm thinking they might actually
come in handy down the road.

783
00:40:14,526 --> 00:40:15,393
What do you think?

784
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:19,830
Hey.

785
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:21,882
What? What is it?
Talk.

786
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:24,552
Nothing.

787
00:40:24,636 --> 00:40:26,170
Well, <i>that's</i> convincing.

788
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:28,706
Did monster-us
give you the jeebs, huh?

789
00:40:28,757 --> 00:40:30,107
'Cause I gotta be honest --

790
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:32,209
I ain't looking in the mirror
for -- for a while myself.

791
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:33,644
Okay.

792
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:38,065
You really want to know
what's wrong?

793
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,567
Yeah.

794
00:40:39,651 --> 00:40:41,852
Yeah, you know my motto --
here to help.

795
00:40:41,903 --> 00:40:45,172
"Here to help."

796
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,691
Kind of like
you helped Amy?

797
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:53,614
Listen, Sam...

798
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:56,200
Don't --
don't lie to me again.

799
00:40:56,251 --> 00:40:58,736
No, don't even talk to me.

800
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:04,458
Yeah, I can't.

801
00:41:04,543 --> 00:41:07,911
You know what, Dean?
I can't.

802
00:41:07,963 --> 00:41:09,680
You can't <i>what?</i>

803
00:41:09,748 --> 00:41:12,683
I can't talk to you
right now!

804
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:14,602
Dean, I can't even be around you
right now!

805
00:41:14,686 --> 00:41:16,920
Okay, so --

806
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:19,390
I think you should just
go on without me.

807
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,781
Go.

808
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,934
All right.

809
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:32,903
Sorry, Sam.
