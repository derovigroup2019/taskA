1
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:04,102
Mr. Singer. I believe
you know Sheriff Mills.

2
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:09,296
Your soul. It's gone.

3
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:12,240
Sam. I'm gonna put up a barrier.

4
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:15,433
Don't scratch the wall.

5
00:00:19,757 --> 00:00:21,837
- You know who I am.
- Lucifer.

6
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:23,133
Hi, Sam.

7
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:25,302
I think this is
my best torture yet.

8
00:00:25,353 --> 00:00:26,386
You never left, Sam.

9
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:27,971
You're still in the cage...

10
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:29,222
With me.

11
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:30,340
This can't be happening.

12
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:38,031
Your vessel's melting.
You're going to explode.

13
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:40,901
There are things much older
than souls in Purgatory,

14
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:43,070
and you gulped
those in, too.

15
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:45,372
- What older things?
- The Leviathans.

16
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:46,873
I-I can't hold them back!

17
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,959
- Hold who back?
- Leviathan!

18
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:50,243
Cass?

19
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:52,963
Cass is -- he's gone.

20
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:03,006
Oh, this is going to be
so much fun.

21
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:22,342
Bobby?

22
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:33,954
How many of you ass-clowns
are in there?

23
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:36,239
A hundred?

24
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,340
More?

25
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:47,601
Your vessel's gonna explode,
ain't it?

26
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:49,419
Wouldn't do anything
too strenuous.

27
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,088
In fact, I'd call it a day,
head on home.

28
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,440
Huh?

29
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:56,643
We'll be back for you.

30
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:14,244
Well...

31
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:16,713
This is a new one.

32
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:32,846
You're not real.

33
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,964
Right.

34
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:38,268
You think this fruit bat
fever dream is reality?

35
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,021
You come back -- I'm sorry --
with no soul,

36
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:43,190
like some peppy
"American Psycho,"

37
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:46,610
till Saint Dean
glues you back together again

38
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:49,779
by buying you
some magic amnesia?

39
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:55,252
You're real.

40
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,620
I'm <i>very</i> real.

41
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:59,673
Everything between is
what we call "set dressing."

42
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:01,708
- No.
- You're still in my cell.

43
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:04,261
You're my bunkmate, buddy.

44
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:06,162
You're my little bitch,

45
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:08,431
in every sense
of the term.

46
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:09,599
Sam.

47
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,384
Sam.

48
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:12,469
- Sam!
- Sam!

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,836
You hearin' me?

50
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:14,971
Whoa!

51
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,191
Look at me. Hey!

52
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:20,861
All right, we got to
button this up.

53
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:23,313
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

54
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:24,347
Come on.

55
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:20,453

00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:40,573
You said it.

60
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:43,727
Those...

Leviathan.

62
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:48,598
Right.

63
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,383
If they're in the pipes,

64
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:53,203
they got themselves
a highway to anywhere.

65
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:56,406
Awesome.

66
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:16,676
Okay.

67
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:20,263
So, he's gone.

68
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:21,848
Yup.

69
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:24,067
Rest in peace...

70
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:26,403
If that's in the cards.

71
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:30,139
Dumb son of a bitch.

72
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:36,746
Well, he was friends with us,
wasn't he?

73
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:39,332
Can't get much dumber
than that.

74
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:40,533
Come on.

75
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:43,319
Those things will be
coming up for air soon.

[ The Doobie Brothers'

and she's ready for floatin' ?

78
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:04,444
? Ol' Mississippi,
she's callin' my name ?

79

92

Oh!

93
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:55,216
Oh!

94
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,291
Hey. Wake up, sunshine.

95
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,625
Up and at 'em, atom man.

96
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:06,728
- Sammy.
- Sammy.

97
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:07,762
Sammy.
Sammy!

98
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:08,963
Hey! Whoa!

99
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,817
That's 12 hours straight.
I'm calling that rested.

100
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:14,402
Here. Hydrate.

101
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:18,022
And, uh, protein-ate.

102
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:22,643
Breakfast in bed.

103
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:25,312
Don't get used to it.
Let me see that hand.

104
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:27,532
Aw, he wants to hold
your widdle hand.

105
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:29,117
How sweet.

106
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,992
Yeah, you'll live.

107
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,518
All right,
take it easy.

108
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:49,303
So, ooze invasion --
any leads?

109
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:51,022
I got all my feelers out.

110
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:54,475
Whatever they're up to,

111
00:07:54,526 --> 00:07:55,977
it ain't --

112
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:58,613
it ain't about going Mothra
down Main Street.

113
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,898
They'll turn up.

114
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:04,318
They seemed pretty eager
to stretch their legs, you know?

115
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,655
Yeah, well, now onto
our other big problem.

116
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:10,458
How are you doing?
And do not say "okay."

117
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:12,877
I'm not okay.

118
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,629
- You think?
- Hey.

119
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:15,913
Go a little easy.

120
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:17,548
There's nothing easy about it,
Bobby, okay?

121
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:19,366
We acted like he had everything
under control.

122
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:20,334
I get it.

123
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:21,803
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,088
Look, I-I didn't exactly
want to crack up, you know?

125
00:08:24,156 --> 00:08:25,873
What the hell happened
back there?

126
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,728
Well, it's not just flashbacks
anymore.

127
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:32,680
Well, then what?

128
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:35,483
It's more like...

129
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,102
I'm seeing
through the cracks.

130
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:40,387
What does that mean?

131
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:42,523
It means I'm having
a difficult time

132
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:43,991
figuring out what's real.

133
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,493
Hallucinations?

134
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:47,779
For starters.

135
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:49,614
Well, for starters, if you're
trippin' hell's bells,

136
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:50,865
why would you hide that?

137
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,617
I wasn't hiding it, Dean.

138
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:55,169
I-I was just
not talking about it.

139
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,371
I mean, it seemed like you two
had enough going on as it was.

140
00:08:57,423 --> 00:09:00,241
Look, I-I just figured try
to hold on to the safety bar

141
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:02,043
and ride it out,
you know?

142
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:03,711
I...

143
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:06,264
But it's getting
more specific.

144
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:08,415
As in, specifically what?

145
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:14,856
What the hell, Sam?

146
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:16,474
I told you.

147
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:17,692
No, I mean, seriously,

148
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,610
how do you -- how do you
argue with that?

149
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:21,863
I know.
I-it's a problem.

150
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,931
Well, now, wait.
I got it.

151
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,118
Why would the Devil holodeck you
a whole new life

152
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:28,936
when he could just kick your ass
all over the cage?

153
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:31,772
'Cause, as he puts it...

154
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:33,191

torture someone

for you to take away.

156
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:37,245
Very good, Sam.

157
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:39,413
Okay, fine.

158
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:41,215
But this
Malibu dream mansion

159
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:43,450
that he -- he -- he makes
for you to take away

160
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:45,503
is this post-apocalyptic
mess?

161
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,588
It had to be a mess, Sam,

162
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,192
or you wouldn't believe
it was your life.

163
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:59,967
Wait, are you seeing him
right now?

164
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:06,240
You know
that he's not real, right?

165
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:13,948
He says the same thing
about you.

166
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:21,005
I'm going back to work.

00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:57,458
<i>without any paperwork</i>
<i>whatsoever!</i>

180
00:10:57,525 --> 00:11:00,578
<i>Well,</i> doctor,
<i>I'm sorry you're so forgetful.</i>

181
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:11,088
Well, at least he's not
curled up under the sink.

182
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:13,424
Yeah, no, he's just
sitting there silently,

183
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:14,842
field-stripping his weapon.

184
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,938
What are you doing?

185
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:28,389
Turning on his GPS

186
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,625
'case he decides
to fly the cuckoo's nest.

187
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:36,614
And you?

188
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:39,283
How are you doing?

189
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:40,418
Seriously, Bobby.

190
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:41,836
It ain't like he's hexed,
you know?

191
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:44,205
I mean, what if this is
the kind of crazy you can't fix?

192
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:46,674
Yeah.
I'm -- I'm worried, too.

193
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,843
But...humor me
for a second.

194
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,077
How are <i>you?</i>

195
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:51,462
Who cares?

196
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:54,265
Don't you think our mailbox
is a little full right now?

197
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:55,633
- I'm fine.
- Right.

198
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:57,885
And weren't you
pissed at him

199
00:11:57,936 --> 00:11:59,887
when he said the same thing

200
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:01,588
just a couple hours
before spilling his marbles

201
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,691
all over the floor?

202
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:06,227
Yeah, well...

203
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:09,230
I'm not Sam, okay?

204
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:11,399
I keep my marbles
in a lead friggin' box.

205
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,567
I'm fine. Really.

206
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:16,370
'Course. Yeah.

207
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:18,906
Just lost one of
the best friends you ever had,

208
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:21,608
your brother's
in the bell jar,

209
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,328
and Purgatory's most wanted
are surfin' the sewer lines,

210
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:26,213
but yeah, yeah, I get it.
Right.

211
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:29,050
You're -- you're <i>fine.</i>

212
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:31,452
Good.

213
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:40,344
'Course...If at any time

214
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:43,447
you want to decide
that's utter horse crap,

215
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:45,132
well, I'll be
where I always am --

216
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,083
right here.

217
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:49,186
What, you want
to do couples' yoga

218
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:51,105
or you want to get back
to hunting the big bads?

219
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:52,356
Shut up.

220
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:55,760
Idjit.

221
00:13:00,982 --> 00:13:03,367
Yeah? Up yours, Manning.

222
00:13:03,452 --> 00:13:06,537
I still got .06
on your time.

223
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:09,173
Hey!
Where were you guys?

224
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:11,175
I guess
we got here early.

225
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,961
Heard something weird
coming from the showers.

226
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:18,665
Hey, what are you doing,
Williams?

227
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:19,717
You're gonna
get in trouble.

228
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,269
Yes, Scott.
I probably am.

229
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:26,673
I think what Williams
is trying to say, Scott,

230
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:27,841
is that we're too hungry
to care.

231
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,513
Crying to the E.R. nurse,

232
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:42,399
screaming,
"mother Mary, mercy!"

233
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:44,701
And when they
opened her back up?

234
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,186
Three sponges
and a set of clamps,

235
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:49,589
sewn up inside
like she was a living pi?ata!

236
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:52,292
You can't
trust these people.

237
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:53,877
Afternoon, ladies.

238
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:55,495
Oh, hello, doctor.

239
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:56,913
Hi, Dr. Gaines.

240
00:13:56,998 --> 00:14:00,467
So, Miss Mills --
you did excellent today.

241
00:14:00,534 --> 00:14:03,094
Just as we discussed --
it was a textbook appendectomy.

242
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:04,081
That's good.

243
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:05,628
But you have been through
a serious surgical procedure.

244
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,591
Now, I know you're tough...

245
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:12,312
...But I want you
to take it easy tonight.

246
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:14,681
Works for me, Doc.
The good news --

247
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:16,983
I put you down for
some pretty fun painkillers.

248
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:18,351
Ooh.

249
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:20,219
I'll check in on you
first thing.

250
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:21,604
You'll be home in no time.

251
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:26,225
Charming, isn't he?
Hmm.

252
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:29,579
Did you know a study
showed 3/4 of doctors

253
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:31,448
cheat on their exams?

254
00:14:31,532 --> 00:14:34,784
He might not know your appendix
from your vagina.

255
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,687
Hey, there, Gunga Din.
Buck up.

256
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:39,789
So, it looks like we got
some bad news for a change.

257
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:42,842
Stockville, North Kansas --
most of a high-school swim team

258
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,178
got mangled to death
in their locker room.

259
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:47,297
Cop-talk on the wire's
kind of garbled --

260
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:50,066
sayin' it looks like some kind
of wild-animal attack.

261
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:52,302
They're saying that whatever
attacked them

262
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:53,636
was about the size
of a linebacker.

263
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,188
It's a lead, Dean.

264
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:57,824
All right, but if you think
you're going out on a hunt...

265
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:00,210
No, I know. I'm not.
But you are.

266
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:02,629
Look,
Bobby's running the hub,

267
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:04,864
I'm 5150'd,

268
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:07,617
which leaves you
to follow this thing up.

269
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:09,285
Sam, you're in the middle
of a psychotic break.

270
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,104
It's a couple hours' drive,
Dean,

271
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:12,539
and it could be
a Leviathan thing.

272
00:15:12,606 --> 00:15:15,625
No, if you think I'm leaving you
here alone...

273
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,661
Hey, what am I,
chopped brains on toast?

274
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:20,630
I can eyeball the kid.
Go.

275
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:23,800
Work off some of these nerves
on something useful.

276
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:26,503
Fine.

277
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,303
You got yourself
an awfully small body.

278
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:45,638
<i>Too</i> small.

279
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:47,240
She didn't know <i>anything.</i>

280
00:15:47,307 --> 00:15:49,192
Can't even
see over the counter.

281
00:15:49,276 --> 00:15:52,278
Well, this one...

282
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:53,363
"Edgar."

283
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:59,002
Edgar worked on something
called a demolitions crew.

284
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:02,705
Watching things blow up
is apparently very satisfying.

285
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,293
"Annie" knew where
babies come from.

286
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:09,012
Disgusting, by the way.

287
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:10,964
I'm hungry.

288
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:12,799
We <i>all</i> are.

289
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,350
Yes, about that.

290
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:17,270
I'm sorry!

291
00:16:17,337 --> 00:16:18,354
Sorry?

292
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:20,390
They ate the swim team.

293
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:22,642
Like I said -- hungry.

294
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:23,893
That's no excuse.

295
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,344
Well, what do you
want me to do?

296
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:28,848
Get them in line.
I don't care how.

297
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:31,484
For God's sake,
it made the papers.

298
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:35,488
Look, the boss, honestly --

299
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:38,258
he just wants to hear
it's taken care of.

300
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:41,377
So take care of it
quickly.

301
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:44,464
I don't like
bringing him bad news.

302
00:16:44,531 --> 00:16:46,199
Are we clear?

303
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,052
Actually, I have an idea.

304
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,671
I could use your help.

305
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:54,874
<i>Dr. Bender</i>
<i>to the mental ward, please.</i>

306
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:56,342
<i>Dr. Bender.</i>

307
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:11,157
Little girl,
can I help you?

308
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,077
Are you a Dr. Sexy?

309
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:17,163
Uh...I'm a surgeon.

310
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:19,165
Where are your parents?

311
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,450
Is it true?

312
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:23,786
Surgeons can just cut into
whatever body they want?

313
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:25,238
What?

314
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:27,740
And remove whichever organs
they please?

315
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,042
Where in the world
did you hear --

316
00:17:29,093 --> 00:17:30,844
I want to be a surgeon
when I grow up.

317
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:33,513
Ow!

318
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,414
Let me go!

319
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:36,466
Aah!

320
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,919
And I want to grow up <i>now!</i>

321
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,222
Aah! Aah!

322
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:59,539
Hi. Special Agent Anderson --
Ian.

323
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:00,657
Yeah, okay.

324
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:02,458
Our point cop's
out on the doughnut.

325
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:04,994
Forensics. I can show you
the layout. And step lightly.

326
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:09,799
We got a whole bunch of NC-17
shizznickle right over there.

327
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:11,784
Right.

328
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:30,103
Damn it.

329
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:35,275
Shh! Just breathe deeply.

330
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:38,111
But my surgery
isn't till tomorrow.

331
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:39,362
I'm Dr. Sexy!

332
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:41,331
Your surgery
is when I say it is.

333
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:06,005
Huh.

334
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:09,309
Not weird at all.

335
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:36,753
Yeah?

336
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:38,704
Well, we are positive
for ick.

337
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:40,139
Same kind of stuff
that came out of Cass.

338
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,392
And, uh, two of the swim kids
are missing.

339
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:44,344
They stole
one of their parents' cars.

340
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:45,878
You know, I really think
Prince William

341
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:48,064
has found the right girl.

342
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:49,816
What do you think?

343
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:51,550
So,
you think these, um,

344
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:54,153
Leviathan things
just jump into people,

345
00:19:54,221 --> 00:19:55,405
like Eve did?

346
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:58,391
I don't know.
It makes sense, right?

347
00:19:58,442 --> 00:20:00,276
Anyway, uh, state troopers got
surveillance cam on the kids,

348
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,245
about six hours old.

349
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,247
They're gassing up just south
of the Dakota line,

350
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:05,832
so I'm headed back your way.

351
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:07,283
We'll just track 'em
from Bobby's.

352
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:08,451
- Yeah. Sounds good.
- Hey.

353
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:11,371
How you doing?

354
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:17,727
You know, uh, okay.

355
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:21,014
Okay. Well, hang in there,
all right?

356
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,917
Just okay?

357
00:20:24,968 --> 00:20:27,387
Man,
I'm having a <i>great</i> day.

358
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:37,206
Miss Mills, what are you doing
out of bed?

359
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,624
Are you okay?

360
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,776
Miss Mills,
you gave us all a scare.

361
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:48,881
What? No, I...

362
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:50,966
You can't be wandering around the
halls like that in your condition.

363
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:52,518
He took -- he took...

364
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,836
What? Who?

365
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:57,005
Dr. Gaines?

366
00:21:57,057 --> 00:22:01,644
Miss Mills, we told you
to take it easy, remember?

367
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,729
Of course.

368
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:05,814
What in the world were you doing
wandering the halls like that?

369
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:06,899
Nothing.

370
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:09,034
Um,
my stitches were itching,

371
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,953
and I just wanted to know
if that was normal,

372
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,788
and I must have fainted
or something.

373
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:15,691
My stitches
feel fine now.

374
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:17,793
Miss Mills,
you can't get out of bed.

375
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,861
You could have
ripped open your sutures

376
00:22:19,913 --> 00:22:21,013
with a fall like that.

377
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:24,283
Don't make me
go back in there.

378
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,469
'Kay?

379
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:30,322
What's that?

380
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,308
This is just something
to help you sleep.

381
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,043
No, that's okay.
I'll sleep just fine.

382
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:35,978
Doctor's orders.

383
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:41,984
I'll check on you later.

384
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:53,028
You can kiss my ass,
Dr. Monsterface.

385
00:22:58,084 --> 00:22:59,251
Oh, God.

386
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,503
Oh, no, no.

387
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:04,640
Okay,
if this is some dream

388
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,293
and you got power over it,
why don't you just end it?

389
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:08,377
End it?

390
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,964
This -- you not knowing
what's real,

391
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:15,134
the paint slowly peeling
off your walls --

392
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:17,136
come <i>on,</i> man.

393
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,606
This is the sweet spot.
Why would I end it?

394
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,524
It's not like
we got HBO in the pit.

395
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:24,476
All I got is you,

396
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:26,145
floating over the coals

397
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:29,565
with half a hope that
you're gonna figure it all out.

398
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,401
There's only one way
to figure it out, Sam.

399
00:23:32,469 --> 00:23:33,869
It's up to you.

400
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:37,072
It ends
when you can't take it anymore.

401
00:23:40,744 --> 00:23:43,712
I think maybe that's why
we're cleaning our guns.

402
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,963
Shut up.

403
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,567
I said shut up!

404
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,586
Hey, Sam.

405
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,304
You, uh...

406
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:57,760
...Havin' a little
bag-lady moment, huh?

407
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,294
Sorry.

408
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,970
Thanks.

409
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:20,366
You know, after...

410
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,418
Everything...

411
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:26,338
All these years,
all that we've been through...

412
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,491
You beat the Devil before,
kid.

413
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:32,544
It's kind of different.

414
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:34,680
Not really.

415
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,832
You'll get a handle
on this, too.

416
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:38,767
You will.

417
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:41,787
You're not in Hell anymore.

418
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,673
You're here, with us.

419
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,781
You hear me, Sam?

420
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,017
Yeah, I hear you, Bobby.

421
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,905
Oh. That's my local.

422
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:04,076
Hello?

423
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,695
Bobby Singer?

424
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:08,714
My surgeon is a monster.

425
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,132
Come again?

426
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,385
He took my windbag roomie,
and he ate her liver.

427
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,203
Except he wasn't --
he wasn't a surgeon.

428
00:25:15,255 --> 00:25:17,289
He...

429
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:20,142
Listen!
His face was...

430
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:23,061
His mouth
was this horrible th--

431
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,680
Who is this?
It's Jody.

432
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,047
Jody Mills.

433
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:27,015
Jody?

434
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:29,017
Sheriff Mills.

435
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:30,218
Gotcha.

436
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,654
I can't exactly
call a deputy here.

437
00:25:32,722 --> 00:25:35,056
Come on, you and I killed
zombies that one time.

438
00:25:35,108 --> 00:25:36,942
I <i>know</i> you handle
this kind of thing.

439
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,911
<i>Please</i> get your ass here
to Sioux Falls General

440
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,280
before he eats me, Singer.

441
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,421
Well, either Sheriff Mills
is having

442
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:52,040
an Obamacare-insured
opium dream

443
00:25:52,091 --> 00:25:53,709
or something's eating folks

444
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,761
down at Sioux Falls
General Hospital.

445
00:25:59,682 --> 00:26:03,886
Look, I-I don't want to bruise
your ego or anything...

446
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,137
No, no, no.
It's -- it's okay.

447
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:08,089
Go, go, go.
I-I'll watch the phones.

448
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,778
So...

449
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,764
Just you and me, huh?

450
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:20,369
What happened to you two?

451
00:26:20,436 --> 00:26:22,154
<i>I</i> did.

452
00:26:22,238 --> 00:26:24,439
Where is Dr. Gaines?

453
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:26,375
Oh, no, that's not
how it works, okay?

454
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:27,709
If you require
a physician's attention,

455
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:28,911
you're gonna have to
fill out these forms --

456
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,496
I can take over from here,
nurse.

457
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,614
These...

458
00:26:32,665 --> 00:26:35,217
Youths obviously require
immediate care.

459
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:46,178
This is where they bring
their bodies to be fixed.

460
00:26:46,262 --> 00:26:48,347
They consider it
a safe place.

461
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:52,601
But the truth is, often
they actually die here instead.

462
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:56,572
And they never question it.
I'm not kidding.

463
00:26:56,639 --> 00:27:01,076
We can feed discreetly.
No one will know.

464
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:02,861
A few of us
in the right positions,

465
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:04,830
and we could feast
every single day.

466
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,583
I'm thinking head nurse and the
staff administrator for a start.

467
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,834
I have to hand it to you --

468
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,152
it's exactly
what the boss asked for.

469
00:27:11,204 --> 00:27:13,322
- Out-of-the-box thinking.
- Yes.

470
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,542
You're off the swim team,
boys.

471
00:27:16,626 --> 00:27:19,661
Time to pursue
a career in medicine.

472
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:25,100
All right. Check in.

473
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:26,635
You won't stay?

474
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,521
I would <i>love</i> to grab us
a good anesthesiologist.

475
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,807
He asked me to check into some
other business in the area.

476
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:36,111
Anyway, seems you've got things
well in hand.

477
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,364
Why can't they scream?

478
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,733
Oh, I severed their vocal cords,
of course.

479
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:46,021
It's a delicate procedure
but very doable.

480
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:08,310
Dean.

481
00:28:08,377 --> 00:28:10,929
Oh. Hey.
Ooh, yeah, good thinking.

482
00:28:11,014 --> 00:28:13,599
Uh...

483
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:15,934
So, I, uh...

484
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:18,904
I followed those
swim-kid Levia...whatever.

485
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,105
- To where?
- Here.

486
00:28:20,189 --> 00:28:21,189
Well, back to town.

487
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,524
And that ain't
the good news.

488
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,942
What?

489
00:28:24,027 --> 00:28:26,028
It ain't just two of them,
I don't think.

490
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,329
Did you call Bobby?

491
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:29,397
Yeah, he's working his own case,
I got to move,

492
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:31,083
and I need backup,
and that means you.

493
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,185
Wait. You --
you sure about that?

494
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:35,037
I know. You're bonkers.

495
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,422
But, luckily, I just need you
to keep the engine running

496
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,874
and wait by the back door.

497
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,259
Just don't, uh...

498
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,045
Don't let Satan
change my presets.

499
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,413
Let's go.

500
00:28:56,476 --> 00:28:59,277
Her name is Mrs. Hackett.
She never came back.

501
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,063
I'll check it out.

502
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,766
Now, you get some rest.
I'll come by later.

503
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:11,873
Bobby Singer, my hero.

504
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,608
That's the roofies
talking.

505
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,226
Foot surgery, huh?

506
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:33,478
Died this morning.

507
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,772
Already autopsied?
What the hell?

508
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,693
- How you doing, Sam?
- In the head region?

509
00:29:47,777 --> 00:29:49,077
Devil
still riding shotgun?

510
00:29:51,814 --> 00:29:54,533
Not right now,
but...Yeah.

511
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:57,869
Maybe we ought to get you,
I don't know, some --

512
00:29:57,954 --> 00:30:00,088
some what?
Some "professional help"?

513
00:30:00,156 --> 00:30:02,541
What are they
gonna do, Dean?

514
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,826
Just stuff me
full of pills.

515
00:30:04,877 --> 00:30:07,462
We'll figure out
some other option.

516
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:08,630
Okay. Yeah.

517
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,383
But what are
your other options?

518
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:13,835
You remember when Martin
took his nosedive

519
00:30:13,886 --> 00:30:15,604
and started shooting
at nothing?

520
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:17,439
I mean, his sweater
unraveled fast.

521
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:19,357
- I'm not Martin.
- No, but you are crazy.

522
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,509
And that don't wash off.
You get that, right?

523
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:25,647
You are never
gonna be okay, Sam.

524
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:52,474
Sam!

525
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,309
Sammy?

526
00:30:59,882 --> 00:31:01,566
Sam?!

527
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:08,223
Oh, crap.

528
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,263
Oh, damn it.
There's five of 'em.

529
00:31:32,748 --> 00:31:33,882
All right. Come on.

530
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,133
Are you sure?

531
00:31:35,218 --> 00:31:37,352
Yeah, and listen,
when we get in there,

532
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:38,436
you got to
keep it together.

533
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,587
Yeah, yeah. I-I will.

534
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:40,856
'Cause if you're seeing
Lucifer,

535
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:42,440
then you could be seeing
all kinds of crap, okay?

536
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,758
You just don't know.

537
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,727
How is this helping?

538
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,596
I'm just saying, Sam,
you're out of control.

539
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:50,732
I'm dealing with it
the best I can.

540
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,317
<i>Dealing?</i>

541
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:53,935
I'm sorry.
That's just funny.

542
00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:55,770
I mean,
how can you deal?

543
00:31:55,822 --> 00:31:57,989
You think this is
an office building, right?

544
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:03,044
Sorry. Wrong.

545
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:05,413
Where the hell are we?

546
00:32:05,464 --> 00:32:08,049
Oh, you think I'm Dean.

547
00:32:08,117 --> 00:32:10,969
Right.

548
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:13,338
You poor clueless
son of a bitch.

549
00:32:13,422 --> 00:32:15,340
Stay the hell away from me.

550
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:18,810
Your world is whatever
I want it to be, understand?

551
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,896
Just leave me alone!

552
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:27,519
Now we're getting there.

553
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:29,771
Pinocchio's
seeing his strings.

554
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,572
Shut up.

555
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:32,274
It's the big crescendo.

556
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,474
I said shut up!

557
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,361
Want to point that gun
at someone useful?

558
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:37,478
Try your face.

559
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,982
You want
to know the truth?

560
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:43,418
You want to skip
to the last page of the book?

561
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:48,823
You know where to aim,
cowboy.

562
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:57,849
It's like a friggin' doggy bag
in here.

563
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,802
Can I help you?

564
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,838
You can maybe
still help this hospital.

565
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,674
Who's responsible for this
sloppy bit of documentation?

566
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:08,226
I know you.

567
00:33:08,311 --> 00:33:09,510
No, you got the wrong guy.

568
00:33:09,562 --> 00:33:10,979
Bobby...

569
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,064
Singer. Yes.

570
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:16,684
We saw you --
through the Angel's eyes.

571
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,825
Let's try
for amnesia, then.

572
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:35,536
Fair enough.

573
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,395
Oh, this can't be good.

574
00:34:02,564 --> 00:34:04,866
Sam? Sam!

575
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,754
Oh, look.
Another me.

576
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,209
Sam,
what are you doing?

577
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,261
Whoa! Whoa!

578
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,629
I thought
I was with you, Dean.

579
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:19,464
Okay.

580
00:34:19,548 --> 00:34:21,599
Well, here I am.

581
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,386
No. No, I-I don't --
I...

582
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,224
I can't know that for sure.

583
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,608
You understand me?

584
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,194
Okay, then we're gonna
have to start small.

585
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:35,363
I don't remember
driving here.

586
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:37,148
Well,
that's because I drove.

587
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:38,366
You <i>thought.</i>

588
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:40,435
Sam is very suggestible.

589
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:44,823
Whoa! Whoa! Sam!

590
00:34:44,907 --> 00:34:48,209
This discussion does not require
a weapons discharge!

591
00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:54,549
Look at me.

592
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,952
Come on.

593
00:34:58,004 --> 00:34:59,888
You don't know what's real?

594
00:34:59,955 --> 00:35:03,475
Look, man,
I've been to Hell.

595
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,177
Okay? I know a thing or two
about torture --

596
00:35:06,262 --> 00:35:10,465
enough to know
that it feels different

597
00:35:10,516 --> 00:35:16,654
than the pain of this -- this
regular stupid crappy this.

598
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,939
No. No, how can you
know that for sure?

599
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,742
Let me see your hand.

600
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:22,610
No, no, no.
The -- the gimp hand.

601
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:23,912
Let me see it.

602
00:35:23,979 --> 00:35:26,831
Smell you,
Florence Nightingale.

603
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:30,251
Hey!

604
00:35:31,454 --> 00:35:33,121
This is real.

605
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,491
Not a year ago,
not in Hell -- now.

606
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:38,209
I was with you
when you cut it.

607
00:35:38,294 --> 00:35:39,878
I sewed it up.

608
00:35:39,962 --> 00:35:40,995
Look.

609
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,350
We've done
a lot more with pain.

610
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:49,521
This is different --
right? --

611
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,839
than the crap
that's tearing at your walnut.

612
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:53,641
<i>I'm</i> different.
Right?!

613
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,045
Yeah, I think so.

614
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,446
You sure about that,
bunk buddy?

615
00:35:58,514 --> 00:36:00,615
Sam.

616
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:01,533
Sam.

617
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,371
Doesn't mean anything.

618
00:36:07,573 --> 00:36:09,824
Hey.

619
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,910
I am your flesh-and-blood
brother, okay?

620
00:36:11,994 --> 00:36:13,531
And I'm the only one
who can legitimately kick

621
00:36:13,556 --> 00:36:14,756
your ass in real time.

622
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,749
You got away.

623
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,717
We got you out, Sammy.

624
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,385
Sammy.

625
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,721
Sammy, I'm the only one
who can --

626
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,974
Believe in that.

627
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,927
Believe <i>me,</i> okay?

628
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:30,595
You got to believe me.

629
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:34,149
You got to make it stone
number one and build on it.

630
00:36:34,216 --> 00:36:36,384
You understand?

631
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:39,387
Yeah. Yeah. Agree.

632
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,897
Bobby. Hey.

633
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:51,332
Sheriff was right!

634
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,785
The hospital thing's
definitely our kind of thing.

635
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:55,587
I double-barreled
one of them in the morgue.

636
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,704
Silver buck shot --

637
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:58,256
no effect.

638
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,375
Bled black ooze.

639
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,877
- Leviathan here?
- I'm fallin' back.

640
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:05,130
I'll meet you at the house.
We can regroup.

641
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,050
Bobby's got a live one.

642
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,585
Okay, well, let's go.

643
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:19,861
Look, when we
get back to Bobby's --

644
00:37:19,928 --> 00:37:21,529
it's okay, Dean.
I'm good.

645
00:37:21,597 --> 00:37:23,231
No white rabbits.

646
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,599
I'm not seeing anything.

647
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,984
Okay.

648
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:28,069
Baby steps.

649
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,743
Oh, no.

650
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:05,123
Oh, no.

651
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,076
Any sign of him?

652
00:38:27,287 --> 00:38:28,471
That place was torched.

653
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,256
Somebody knew
what they were doing.

654
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:31,641
You think
Bobby was back there?

655
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,977
I don't know.

656
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,729
Bobby!

657
00:38:44,304 --> 00:38:46,506
<i>This is Bobby Singer's</i>
<i>direct hot line.</i>

658
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,690
<i>You should not</i>
<i>have this number.</i>

659
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:51,711
You <i>cannot</i> be
in that crater back there.

660
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:54,114
I can't -- if you're gone,

661
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,367
I swear I am going to strap
my "Beautiful Mind" brother

662
00:38:57,451 --> 00:38:58,585
into the car,

663
00:38:58,652 --> 00:38:59,953
and I'm gonna drive us
off the pier.

664
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,256
You asked me how I was doing?

665
00:39:03,323 --> 00:39:05,792
Well, not good.

666
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,028
Now, you said you'd be here.

667
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,631
Where are you?

668
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,853
Bobby!

669
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,504
Bobby?!

670
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,361
Bobby?!

671
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,901
Bobby!

672
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,408
Winchester.

673
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:40,410
Congratulations.

674
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,545
Apparently, you two
are competent enough

675
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,797
to warrant annihilating.

676
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:45,999
I'd take it
as a compliment.

677
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,600
Aah!

678
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,774
Dean! Now!

679
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,791
Sam.

680
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:31,077
Sammy?! Hey, come on, now.

681
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,846
Come on, I'm the one
with the broken leg.

682
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:33,963
You got to carry me!

683
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,300
Sam?!

684
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:50,375
Sam?

685
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,294
You stay with me,
you hear?

686
00:40:52,361 --> 00:40:53,578
Male, late 20s,
head trauma.

687
00:40:53,663 --> 00:40:56,364
Signs of increasing
intracranial pressure.

688
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:59,534
Hey,
so maybe I'm not real.

689
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:01,219
Nobody's perfect.

690
00:41:01,304 --> 00:41:03,555
But I'm not
going anywhere, Sam.

691
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,974
Sam? Sammy!

692
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,592
Yeah, he's seizing.

693
00:41:07,677 --> 00:41:08,927
Give him 10 of valium.

694
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,479
Copy that. We're just pulling in
to Sioux Falls.

695
00:41:10,546 --> 00:41:12,731
Sioux Falls?
Sioux Falls General?

696
00:41:12,815 --> 00:41:14,149
No, no, no.

697
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:16,234
No, you got to take us
somewhere else. Anywhere!

698
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,385
Please!

699
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:18,487
Yeah, okay, buddy.
