1
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:06,436
You look horrific. When was the
last time you really slept a night?

2
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:07,604
Let's just work,
all right?

3
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:19,057
Killer clown. I know
what you're thinking, Sam.

4
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,716
"Why did it
have to be clowns?"

5
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:21,580
Give me a break.

6
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:22,991
You didn't think
I remembered, did you?

7
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:24,749
Come on,
you still bust out crying

8
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,148
whenever you see Ronald McDonald
on the television.

9
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:27,390
At least I'm not afraid
of flying.

10
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:29,169
Planes crash.
And apparently clowns kill.

11
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,646
It's okay.

12
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,099
They can't hurt you.
They <i>can't</i> hurt you.

13
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,883
"If it bleeds, you can kill it."

14
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:52,152
Yeah.

15
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,403
"If it bleeds, you can kill it."

16

18
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,907
Hello?

19
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,943
Ye--

20
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,662
"I am the eggman."

21
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:55,749
Seriously, Frank,
pay phones?

22
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,133
I mean, come on.

23
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,502
I'm getting the clap off
this thing just touching it.

24
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,007
Fred Savage? Really?

25
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:08,311
Yeah, no, I know,
big mouths are everywhere.

26
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:11,130
Uh, well, since you asked,

27
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:13,633
some actual intel on the
Dick Roman guy <i>would</i> be nice.

28
00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:14,967
Fine.

29
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:16,102
All right.

30
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:17,637
Yeah, good looking out.

31
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,144
I hope he finds
something quick.

32
00:02:25,196 --> 00:02:27,146
This whole protocol du jour thing's
really creeping my cheese.

33
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,032
So, we got dick on Dick?

34
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:32,652
That's a vivid way
of putting it.

35
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,621
You find anything on Wonder Woman?
No.

36
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:37,040
And there probably won't be.
They are definitely gone.

37
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,175
<i>But</i> I might have found
something over in Kansas.

38
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,593
All right,
well, let's do it.

39
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,495
But, uh, a few simple rules,
okay? No babies.

40
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:44,431
In fact, no baby mamas.
No bars.

41
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,267
No booze --
no hot chicks of any kind.

42
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,602
Wait, wait, wait.
Did you just say --

43
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,304
Hey. <i>You</i> spawn
a monster baby,

44
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:53,690
see how quick <i>you</i> want
to dive back in the pool.

45
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:56,509
Ohh.

46
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,679
Those are <i>not</i> the fun kind
of hickeys.

47
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,315
You're -- you're saying
an <i>octopus</i> did this?

48
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:04,200
Not just any octopus.

49
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,286
Based on welt diameter,

50
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,621
enteroctopus dofleini.

51
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,791
And for those of us who skipped
the enteroctopus class?

52
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,526
Giant pacific octopus.

53
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:16,195
How giant we talking, Doc?

54
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:17,697
Approximately 30 feet.

55
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,387
I mean, aren't...
giant octopi rare around here?

56
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:25,505
Yet here we are.

57
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:26,673
All right,
so what happens?

58
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:28,124
Guy comes home,
cracks a beer,

59
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,760
and gets...suckered
to death?

60
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,812
Obviously, this was some kind
of freak fetish attack.

61
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,147
Someone created
those hickey marks,

62
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,216
then bled the man out.

63
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,106
That bite look
a little vamp-y to you?

64
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,240
Yeah, no question.

65
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,825
So what are we
looking for?

66
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,410
An octovamp?
A vamptopus?

67
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:49,496
That's crazy even for us,
right?

68
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,281
It does push the envelope.

69
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,032
Let's go chat up
the widow.

70
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:59,122
We're very sorry
for your loss, ma'am.

71
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,407
Mrs. Harper, we know
this is, uh, bad timing.

72
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:02,556
But we just have a few
routine questions

73
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:03,787
that we need to ask you --
is that okay?

74
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:05,012
Yeah.

75
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,630
Did the house
feel any different lately?

76
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,215
Different...?

77
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:11,101
Anything strange.

78
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,268
Cold spots.

79
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,304
Uh, did you smell
anything weird?

80
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:15,388
Maybe sulfury?

81
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,791
No. Not that
I can remember.

82
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,259
Okay, we're just ticking
all the boxes here.

83
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:23,480
Um, what about any skeletons
in your husband's closet?

84
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:26,566
- Skeletons?
- What do you mean?

85
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:28,835
Can you think of anybody
who would want to do him harm?

86
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:31,604
A colleague,
an old flame.

87
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,392
The tiniest detail
could really help.

88
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,747
You want to know
what he was up to lately?

89
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:41,815
Ask Stacey.

90
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,284
She was here
the night he died.

91
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,669
Um...Stacey?

92
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,338
Our nanny.

93
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,792
Any other questions?

94
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:54,978
No, that's...

95
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,095
Thank you.

96
00:04:56,147 --> 00:04:56,980
You've been a big help.

97
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:06,523
Really appreciate
the hospitality, ma'am.

98
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,835
Mom, dad, nanny --

99
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,204
boy, that is a love triangle
right out of casa erotica.

100
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,039
'Course, in those,
the jealous wife

101
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,375
tends to channel her feelings
more productively.

102
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:29,462
The only thing I can't wrap
my mind around is --

103
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:31,330
What, how wife lady
summoned an octovamp?

104
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:32,465
More like "why?"

105
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:33,883
I mean,
kind of impractical, right?

106
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:36,436
Yeah.

107
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,354
All right, one of us needs to go
talk to the naughty nanny.

108
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,689
The other one stay here,

109
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:40,974
shake down the place
when the wife leaves --

110
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,108
see what
we're dealing with.

111
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,142
All right.
I'm on the nanny.

112
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:44,277
No, I'm on the nanny.

113
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,179
I thought you said
no hot chicks.

114
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:48,231
We don't know
that she's hot.

115
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,404
Now, uh,
how would you describe

116
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,856
your relationship
with the deceased?

117
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:58,908
I don't know.
Normal, I guess.

118
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:00,410
Normal?

119
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,878
Well, I mostly dealt
with Debra.

120
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:06,032
There was nothing going on,
if that's what you mean.

121
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,968
Debra said that you were at
the house late the night that...

122
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,202
That Brian died.

123
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,872
Yeah.

124
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:15,225
Brian was working late,
so I stayed with Kelly.

125
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,426
She was pretty upset.

126
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,727
Why's that?

127
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,096
Well, it was her birthday.

128
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,815
We had a party
at Plucky's.

129
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,218
Plucky's.
Why does that sound familiar?

130
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,821
Plucky Pennywhistle's
Magical Menagerie?

131
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,357
Pizza chain for kids.

132
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:33,910
Actually, more
for lazy parents.

133
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:38,031
Anyway, her dad showed up

134
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:40,399
for five minutes,
then he went back to work.

135
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:42,735
And, of course,
her mom was out of town.

136
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:45,955
This stupid kid told Kelly her
folks didn't really love her.

137
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,740
She freaked.

138
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,292
I was calming her down
for hours.

139
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,795
Uh, did you...notice anything
weird at the house?

140
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,547
Weird like...?

141
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:57,249
Anything.
Even a bad feeling.

142
00:06:57,301 --> 00:07:00,520
No, nothing like that.

143
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:05,758
Actually, Kelly does have
a weird thing about closets.

144
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:07,944
But it's just kid stuff.

145
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,646
Try me.

146
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,665
She thinks there's a monster
in her closet.

147
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,451
It drives everyone crazy.

148
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,040
Hey, we talked
to the wrong person.

149
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,441
What?

150
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,243
Yeah, forget the mom.
Talk to the daughter.

151
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:26,079
She's mad at her dad
for ditching her birthday.

152
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,330
So, what do you think?

153
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,115
A birthday wish gone wrong,
something like that?

154
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,433
I don't know.
It could be.

155
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,901
I got a 20
on her right now.

156
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:32,802
Can you get to her without
tripping the AMBER Alert?

157
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,255
I'll try.

158
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:38,391
All right,
see what you can find out.

159
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,564
Whatcha working on there?

160
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,316
I know who you are.

161
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,135
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

162
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:50,920
You're the guy
that talked to my mom.

163
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:53,356
That's right. I did.

164
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,307
Kelly!

165
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,243
Something wrong?

166
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,079
My mom will get mad
if I talk to you.

167
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,251
Um...How come?

168
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,170
Because of what I told
the police.

169
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,154
And what did you tell
the police?

170
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:12,324
I told them that I tried
to warn my dad.

171
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,795
That the monster
would get him.

172
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,549
Kelly. Come here!
Now!

173
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,666
Kelly!

174
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:09,182
Aah!

175
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:11,884
Ugh!

176
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:50,077
"If it bleeds,
you can kill it."

177
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:19,289
Huh.

178
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,360
Hey. Um...

179
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:24,728
Okay, so,
the horse I get.

180
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,097
The hoofprints,
the jumping over the fence.

181
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,899
But, uh,
what ran him through?

182
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,368
Best thing I could tell you
is something <i>big.</i>

183
00:10:31,435 --> 00:10:33,203
So, what, like a lance?

184
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:45,132
It's sad.

185
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:46,883
Lady's got to pull
her friggin' 8-year-old

186
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:48,635
out of school
and tell him his dad's dead.

187
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,588
Excuse me.

188
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,142
Excuse me, ma'am?

189
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:56,977
Agent Jones, FBI.

190
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:59,980
I'm sorry.
I-I really need to go.

191
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:02,816
Okay. Uh,
just one quick question,

192
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,101
if you don't mind.

193
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:06,653
Um, was yesterday
your son's birthday?

194
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:10,941
Billy's birthday? No.
Why would you ask that?

195
00:11:10,992 --> 00:11:13,643
Nothing. Never mind.

196
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:15,996
Oh. But...

197
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,415
His father did take him

198
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:20,701
to a friend's
birthday party yesterday.

199
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:31,795
Hey.

200
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:34,965
Hey. You remember a chain
called Plucky Pennywhistle's?

201
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:38,802
No.

202
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:41,188
Really? Could have swore
you loved those places.

203
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:42,623
No, dude, I <i>hated</i> them.

204
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,276
Uh, you would dump me
and go trolling for chicks.

205
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:47,694
It's not like I left you
in jail.

206
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,613
I mean, those places
are supposed to be fun.

207
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,782
Fun?
Uh, they're lame.

208
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:54,034
And they smell like puke.

209
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:55,352
And the ice cream
is all grainy.

210
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:57,187
All right, don't have
one of your episodes, okay?

211
00:11:57,238 --> 00:11:59,623
I'm just saying I hit
a dead end with this whole

212
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,907
wishes-gone-wild thing,

213
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:02,993
but both kids
were at Plucky's day of.

214
00:12:03,044 --> 00:12:05,379
Look, why don't you go
check out the local Plucky's

215
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:06,913
and ask
about this Billy kid?

216
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:08,365
Look, man,
w-why don't I just...

217
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,217
Why don't I just
wait for you to get back?

218
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:11,335
No can do, Hermano.

219
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:12,803
I'm on my way
to talk to little Billy.

220
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,640
Why -- why -- why don't <i>I</i> talk
to Billy...Right now?

221
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:18,425
Wait, wait, wait.

222
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:21,211
This isn't about your, uh,
your clown thing, is it?

223
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:23,063
What?!

224
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:24,898
No!

225
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:26,066
Sammy?

226
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,351
No.

227
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:30,237
Yeah, what in the world
did they do to you?

228
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:32,105
All right, you know what?
Never mind.

229
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,074
Just know that 99.99%

230
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:35,892
of all clowns
can't hurt you.

231
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:38,195
Okay?
And if it bleeds,

232
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:39,746
you can kill it.

233
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,201
"If it bleeds, you can kill it."

234
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,881
I'm too old for this.

235
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,781
Welcome to Plucky's,

236
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,533
where all your dreams
are good.

237
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:19,986
Could you just,
uh, maybe...

238
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:21,788
Just get the manager
for me?

239
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:23,990
Okay.

240
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,318
I just need you to stay sane
for three more hours.

241
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:54,070
Okay? Here.

242
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:56,273
Finish your homework.

243
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:58,942
Like I can concentrate
in here.

244
00:14:18,963 --> 00:14:20,830
Real beauties, huh?

245
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:22,966
We rotate them out
once a week.

246
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:26,002
Kids love having their art
on the wall.

247
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:27,888
"Draw your worst fear"?

248
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:29,139
I <i>know.</i>

249
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,941
But we don't post
the truly evil stuff --

250
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:33,477
just the standard crap
like sharks and ghosts.

251
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:37,180
Jean Holiday,
shift manager.

252
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:38,949
Johnson, FBI.

253
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:40,617
So
tell me --

254
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:44,037
why even ask the kids to draw
creepy stuff to begin with?

255
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:46,540
It's just an exercise...

256
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,625
Some pop psychologist
came up with.

257
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:50,193
Plus, the owner's obsessed

258
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:51,912
with "aiding children's
development."

259
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:53,797
So, the place mat
is a safe way

260
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:55,999
to get kids to talk
about their fears.

261
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,301
You know, we get them
to sketch it in a little box,

262
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:00,870
and -- voil?! --
Plucky magically transforms it

263
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:02,339
into rainbows and candy.

264
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:05,509
Personally, I think
it's a load of hooey,

265
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,644
but they say that
if these fears run wild,

266
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:09,879
then it affects kids
long into their adulthood.

267
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:19,656
Yeah, I've -- I've --
I've heard that.

268
00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:22,492
Um...So, I don't know
if you'll remember,

269
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,779
but there was a kid
in here yesterday

270
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,197
named Billy Pogue
for a party?

271
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:28,865
Oh, the conniption kid.

272
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,417
Conniption?
He -- he had --

273
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,902
No, no, no, not him.
He was fine. It was his dad.

274
00:15:32,954 --> 00:15:35,672
He pulls the kid away
before cake and presents,

275
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:37,791
and I guess the kid asked to
stay for another five minutes.

276
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,093
The dad pulls
a full-frontal douchebag,

277
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:41,211
starts screaming.

278
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:42,912
Just embarrassed
for the kid.

279
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:55,775
Hey. Hey.

280
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,427
Hey!

281
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:03,984
You a cop?

282
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:05,986
Uh, yeah.
I'm a Fed.

283
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,656
Uh, what are you
investigating?

284
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,274
Couple of crazy deaths.

285
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:13,910
Why, is there something
you want to share?

286
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:15,945
Look -- not now.

287
00:16:15,997 --> 00:16:19,049
Too many eyes.

288
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:21,167
Come back after closing.

289
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:31,845
Hey.

290
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:34,898
So, what's the lowdown
with trauma town?

291
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,734
I can tell you this much.

292
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,969
Neither vic was up
for parent of the year.

293
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:41,821
Kelly's dad skipped
her birthday,

294
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:44,658
and Billy's dad pulled one
of those Dick Parent scenes

295
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:46,142
that makes
everyone cringe.

296
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:47,310
What the hell are these?

297
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:48,445
Kid therapy.

298
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:49,913
Um, you draw
your worst nightmare --

299
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,164
poof! --
Plucky fixes it.

300
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:52,815
Um, they hang them up
on this big wall.

301
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:55,118
Well,
can't argue with this.

302
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:56,819
Leprechauns <i>are</i> deadly.

303
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,507
Okay, so, Kelly <i>draws</i>
<i>a monster,</i>

304
00:17:00,591 --> 00:17:02,542
and then that goes after
her father?

305
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:04,127
That's what we're saying?

306
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:06,429
Well, here's the thing.
They label those.

307
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:08,431
And guess which two
were missing.

308
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:10,600
Well, name tag was there --
no place mat.

309
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:11,935
Little miss octovamp.

310
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:13,770
Yeah. And...

311
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:16,039
- Billy.
- So...

312
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,475
Somehow, whatever he drew
came to life

313
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:20,694
and killed his dad,
riding a horse.

314
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,480
Close, but no Seabiscuit.

315
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:26,866
See, I went and had
a little chat with Billy.

316
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:28,451
And he drew me this.

317
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,324
Wait.

318
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,492
So now unicorns are evil?

319
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:37,544
- Yeah.
- Obviously.

320
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:39,412
Great.

321
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:41,331
Well, now the question is,

322
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:45,251
how did a Unicorn come off
a sketch and kill Billy's dad?

323
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:47,036
How's <i>any</i> of this
happening?

324
00:17:49,974 --> 00:17:51,641
Well, that's it for me.

325
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,209
Guess I'll head out.

326
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,561
Uh, one more thing.

327
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:56,646
Some kid puked
in the ball pit.

328
00:17:56,714 --> 00:17:59,015
It's gonna need
a full sanitization.

329
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:01,217
Do that,
and then you can clock out.

330
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:26,092
Aah!

331
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,767
Ah!

332
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:36,352
Aah!

333
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:06,599
Aah!

334
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,812
Hold on one second
there, guys.

335
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:42,669
All right.
Uh, thank you.

336
00:19:45,673 --> 00:19:46,873
So?

337
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:48,825
The manager found the body
in the ball pit.

338
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:50,159
Blood everywhere.

339
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:51,427
Cops have a theory?

340
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:52,712
Yeah, they think
the ball washer did it.

341
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:54,931
The what?
The...ball washer.

342
00:19:54,998 --> 00:19:56,883
The what?
The ball --

343
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:58,968
Look at this.

344
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:03,356
Thank you, gentlemen.

345
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,894
That's a shark bite.

346
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:09,279
Yeah.

347
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:10,864
And, uh,
judging from the radius,

348
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:12,181
I'd say a 20-footer,
at least.

349
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:16,519
"Shark Week," man.
How do you not watch that?

350
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:19,455
Whole week of sharks.

351
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:36,539
Omar Cooper.

352
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,374
How much you want to bet

353
00:20:38,425 --> 00:20:39,976
little Omar here
was scared of sharks?

354
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:41,561
And Saul the janitor
is connected how?

355
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:42,946
I mean, he's not related
to Omar.

356
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:46,349
No. But Saul had something
he wanted to tell me.

357
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,651
So this isn't about ganking
some dickweed parent.

358
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:50,720
More like, uh,
silencing a whistle-blower?

359
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,488
Great, so whatever
we're looking for

360
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:55,742
can literally fire off
childhood fears at will.

361
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:58,561
Wow. Watch out
for evil lunch ladies.

362
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:00,196
All right.

363
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:01,447
Let's comb this place.

364
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:05,285
Seriously.

365
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:06,786
Dractopus.

366
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:08,538
Seabiscuit the impaler.

367
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:11,174
Land shark -- what's next?

368
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:20,416
Okay, Tyler, that's it.

369
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:22,218
You got to take the bus
from here.

370
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:23,219
But I thought --

371
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,354
I can't. I'm sorry.

372
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:25,605
I'm late.

373
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:28,892
Here.

374
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:36,933
Stay out of trouble.

375
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:01,137
Whee!

376
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,007
Aah!

377
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:09,896
Ohh.

378
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:11,381
Ow!

379
00:22:23,494 --> 00:22:25,111
Maybe...Tulpa?

380
00:22:25,196 --> 00:22:28,365
No, killing's are
too spread out.

381
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,033
True.

382
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:32,085
Um...Angel?

383
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:33,569
It's a little imaginative
for the God squad,

384
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:35,121
don't you think?

385
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,841
All right. So...What?

386
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:39,959
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm tapped out.

387
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:43,546
Well, whatever it is,

388
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:45,465
at least we know
<i>where</i> it is.

389
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:46,966
Plucky's!

390
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,703
That's where the victims
are getting picked up.

391
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,107
Yeah, but we swept the place
last night, and nada.

392
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:55,542
I can go back.

393
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,644
Go to the employees,
maybe dig up some dirt.

394
00:22:57,728 --> 00:23:00,246
What good's that gonna do?
They think you're a Fed.

395
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:02,632
The one guy who was gonna rat,
he got Bruce'd.

396
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,201
If anybody knows anything,
they're not gonna tell you.

397
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:07,454
All right. Yep.
That's the plan.

398
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:08,771
I'll go back...

399
00:23:08,823 --> 00:23:11,107
Play bad cop,
really lean into them.

400
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,276
And...?

401
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:16,329
And...when I'm done,
then you watch them.

402
00:23:16,414 --> 00:23:19,416
So if somebody freaks out,
then that's our creep.

403
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:22,469
Or he'll lead us closer,
and you can track him.

404
00:23:22,553 --> 00:23:25,004
Well, what's <i>my</i> cover?

405
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:26,956
I don't know.
Just hang back.

406
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:28,341
Act normal.

407
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:34,564
Yeah, yeah. Guy in his 30s
hanging out at Plucky's alone --

408
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:35,982
that's normal.

409
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:37,467
That's not pervy at all.

410
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:39,069
So, it doesn't matter
what people say.

411
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:40,236
We've roped it off.

412
00:23:40,304 --> 00:23:42,021
I've notified the powers
that be. Everyone's aware.

413
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:44,407
Just no one goes in the...

414
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:46,109
Hi.

415
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,527
Agent.

416
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:48,478
I bet I know
why you're here.

417
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,163
How's business?

418
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:52,482
Turns out not even
grim flippin' death

419
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:53,614
can slow down
the birthday fun.

420
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:54,834
Oh.

421
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:56,369
We roped off the ball pit,
though,

422
00:23:56,454 --> 00:23:57,820
until corporate
can get here.

423
00:23:57,872 --> 00:24:00,290
I just can't believe
the machine fritzed

424
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:01,708
and did Saul in
like that.

425
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,126
Yeah,
that makes two of us.

426
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:04,594
I'm gonna need to talk
to some of your employees.

427
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:05,845
Like who?

428
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,980
Like <i>you.</i>

429
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:30,286
Howdy, friend.

430
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:31,821
Giant slinky.

431
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:33,356
Would have killed for one
of those when I was a kid.

432
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:34,690
How much?

433
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:36,042
1,000 tickets.
American dinero. How much?

434
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:38,361
Oh, we don't take cash here
at Plucky Pennywhistle's.

435
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:41,164
Only tickets won through
hard work and determination.

436
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,833
You mainlined
the kool-aid, huh?

437
00:24:47,304 --> 00:24:50,557
It's double-ticket Tuesday
if you play skeeball.

438
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:57,564
Howdy, friend!

439
00:25:03,154 --> 00:25:04,988
So, where were you
last night?

440
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:07,157
Well, here.

441
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:08,741
Obviously.

442
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:11,227
I <i>found</i> him.

443
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,197
But I was by the cash register
the whole time.

444
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:16,533
There's a security camera
pointed right at the counter.

445
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,585
- The cops already looked at it.
- Uh-huh.

446
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:20,203
And you heard nothing?

447
00:25:20,254 --> 00:25:21,971
I heard the ball blaster.

448
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,739
I <i>didn't</i> hear him.

449
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:25,959
If I did, I would have
run in, of course.

450
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:27,577
Yeah, right, right.

451
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:28,878
So <i>that's</i> your excuse.

452
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:30,797
My <i>what?</i>

453
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:32,915
Look, I know
I'm new to this job, but I'm --

454
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:35,151
What?

455
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:36,970
- How new?
- Couple weeks.

456
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:38,354
I just got promoted.

457
00:25:38,422 --> 00:25:41,090
Hmm.

458
00:25:41,141 --> 00:25:45,895
So, uh, was there a lot
of competition for the gig?

459
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:47,013
I guess.

460
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:50,533
It comes with benefits.

461
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:52,735
The bosses had us
all write essays

462
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:55,405
about how we would
do our best for the kids,

463
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,639
and they picked me.

464
00:25:56,707 --> 00:25:58,458
Don't be shocked,

465
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:01,077
but I actually did two semesters
at college, so...

466
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:05,131
I'm not in any kind
of trouble, am I?

467
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:08,501
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

468
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:12,255
Look, I <i>know</i> I'm not perfect,
but I'm trying.

469
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:14,624
And, I mean, it's not as if
I'd ever do anything illegal.

470
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:18,228
Sure you wouldn't.

471
00:26:57,768 --> 00:26:59,135
<i>Special</i> Agent?

472
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:00,553
Wow!

473
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:02,138
I want you to know, sir,

474
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:03,753
that I really appreciate
what you do, and --

475
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:04,978
Quiet.

476
00:27:17,354 --> 00:27:19,021
Hey!

477
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:20,290
Stop cheating!

478
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:27,530
You heard him.
Knock it off!

479
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:33,303
Jackass. Jackass.

480
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:36,139
Tyler, soup's on.

481
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:40,876
- But, mom, I don't want --
- Just eat it.

482
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,228
But it sucks!

483
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:54,190
Hey, why don't you cut her
some slack?

484
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,408
What do you care?

485
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:57,393
Because I've been
where you are.

486
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,662
Your mom made you camp at
a stupid Plucky's after school?

487
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,614
Y-- no.

488
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:07,370
No, but my dad,
he...hauled me places.

489
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:09,789
Besides,
she's working a tough gig.

490
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:11,591
You know?
She's exhausted.

491
00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:15,094
You should take pity
on the old.

492
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,513
And, hey, free grub.

493
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:19,298
That stuff tastes
like butt.

494
00:28:19,383 --> 00:28:20,717
What?

495
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:22,918
Come on,
it can't be that bad.

496
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,919
Let's see here.

497
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:28,057
Ah.

498
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,394
That <i>is</i> butt.

499
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:37,984
You scared of robots?

500
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:39,869
They have laser eyes.

501
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:41,437
Yes.

502
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:44,540
Howdy, friend!
What's your name?

503
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:47,377
Hi.

504
00:28:55,452 --> 00:28:56,786
Lose the head.

505
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:00,440
Why'd you do it?

506
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:02,458
Do...What?

507
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,610
I think you know.

508
00:29:04,678 --> 00:29:06,813
I...

509
00:29:06,897 --> 00:29:07,847
I got rights.

510
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:08,898
You can't --

511
00:29:10,401 --> 00:29:12,134
I'm the federal
government, pal.

512
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:13,803
- I can do whatever I want.
- Okay. I'll talk.

513
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:19,742
Dean!

514
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:39,128
Hey! Hey! Come here!

515
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:42,298
Hey!

516
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:50,339
If this is about the meth lab
that fireballed up in Butte,

517
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,340
it wasn't me.

518
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:52,809
Okay, it was my brother,

519
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,194
but, um, we got
the same fingerprints, and...

520
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,814
Please. This is
the best job I ever had.

521
00:29:57,865 --> 00:29:59,949
All right, look, uh...

522
00:30:00,016 --> 00:30:01,367
Cliff.
Cliff.

523
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:02,785
You're not using
kids' nightmares

524
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:03,786
to smoke people,
are you, Cliff?

525
00:30:03,854 --> 00:30:06,873
I don't...think so.

526
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:10,710
Get up.

527
00:30:10,794 --> 00:30:12,027
What's going on?

528
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,663
All right, cards up.

529
00:30:13,714 --> 00:30:16,799
Yeah, we don't care that you,
you know, broke bad or whatever.

530
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:19,502
But there is some seriously
weird going on in there.

531
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:21,704
You mean the sub-basement.

532
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:23,706
This place
has a sub-basement?

533
00:30:23,757 --> 00:30:25,391
Sure.
Door's out back.

534
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:26,642
Easy to miss
if you don't know.

535
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,760
What's in there?

536
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:29,345
Alls I know is...

537
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:32,882
Me and Saul used to come in
after hours sometimes and...

538
00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:38,654
You ever shroom
in a ball pit?

539
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:43,493
Not that I...would,
agents.

540
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,579
It was Saul.
Just Saul. All alone.

541
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:47,997
Anyway...

542
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,833
Sometimes we'd hear, like,
spooky stuff,

543
00:30:50,901 --> 00:30:52,285
through the vents...

544
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:55,004
Coming up
from the boiler room.

545
00:30:58,592 --> 00:31:00,209
Okay, kiddo.
Let's go.

546
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,744
But somebody stole it!

547
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:04,514
So, draw another one!

548
00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:05,681
Okay?

549
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:08,184
We gotta go.

550
00:31:10,888 --> 00:31:12,855
Okay. I'm sorry.

551
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:15,858
Thank you.

552
00:31:15,926 --> 00:31:17,259
That place mat
sucked anyway.

553
00:31:29,272 --> 00:31:30,439
Dean. What?
What is it?

554
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,158
While you were out
being Dirty Harry,

555
00:31:32,242 --> 00:31:35,328
uh, Tyler's mom
got pissy with him,

556
00:31:35,412 --> 00:31:36,996
and now
his place mat's missing.

557
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,581
So, what do you think?

558
00:31:38,632 --> 00:31:40,783
I think the bitchy mom

559
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:44,003
plus, uh, sad kid
plus place mat

560
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:46,472
with something nuts
written on it...

561
00:31:46,557 --> 00:31:47,974
equals wacky corpse.

562
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:49,475
So you think she's next
on the list?

563
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,844
All right, I'll tail them
just to be safe. You --

564
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:52,962
check the boiler room.
I know.

565
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:54,630
Right.

566
00:31:54,681 --> 00:31:55,898
Oh. Oh.

567
00:31:55,966 --> 00:31:57,516
Uh, Dean, hey, uh,
any idea what he drew?

568
00:31:57,601 --> 00:31:58,901
- Robot.
- Robot?

569
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:00,803
Yeah, about the size
of a house.

570
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:02,304
Shoots destructo beams
out of its eyes.

571
00:32:04,575 --> 00:32:05,441
At least
I'll see it coming.

572
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:06,525
Yeah.

573
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:29,465
Now, that's perfectly normal.

574
00:32:58,912 --> 00:33:00,479
Drop it.

575
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:08,671
Drop it!

576
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,178
Mm-hmm.
Now kick it over.

577
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:24,403
Some pretty heavy hoodoo
you got here.

578
00:33:24,488 --> 00:33:26,322
I gotta say,
as far as I know,

579
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:29,775
none of these things,
uh, can poop out a Unicorn.

580
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,829
There's power in fear.

581
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:37,950
And when a child draws
what he's afraid of,

582
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:42,121
a little of that mojo
ends up on the page.

583
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:44,573
So, what, you toss it
in the fire,

584
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:47,626
and some bed-wetter's
horror show comes to life?

585
00:33:47,711 --> 00:33:49,545
I got to get something
off the parent, too.

586
00:33:51,247 --> 00:33:52,465
Something they own.

587
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:54,717
That bit gets tricky.

588
00:33:54,768 --> 00:33:56,919
Well, it hasn't seemed
to slow you down.

589
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,189
I'm just doing
what I need to!

590
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:01,924
Okay. Okay.

591
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:03,726
I get it. Okay?

592
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:09,264
No drawing...

593
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:10,483
No Iron Giant!

594
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:15,154
Oh, that b-word
is still on the list!

595
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:16,822
But not tonight.

596
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:17,990
Bigger fish.

597
00:34:18,075 --> 00:34:20,259
What, are you gonna shoot me,
Howard?

598
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:22,945
You really want a body
on your hands?!

599
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:24,630
- Blood everywhere?!
- You shut up!

600
00:34:24,715 --> 00:34:28,050
'Cause I got lots of ways
to take care of bullies.

601
00:34:28,118 --> 00:34:29,118
Don't you worry.

602
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:30,386
Like that FBI guy.

603
00:34:30,453 --> 00:34:31,504
He's your pal, right?

604
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:35,641
I saw you chase
Cliff down.

605
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:39,595
Five minutes ago,
his business card was torched.

606
00:34:39,646 --> 00:34:41,897
Along with something
from my...

607
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:44,316
personal collection.

608
00:34:45,736 --> 00:34:49,138
I-I-I picked it out
real special for him, too.

609
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:51,657
Soon as I saw him,
I noticed.

610
00:34:51,742 --> 00:34:54,744
He was staring
at every little Plucky

611
00:34:54,811 --> 00:34:57,830
like it was gonna stab him
or something.

612
00:35:07,707 --> 00:35:09,592
Guy's got a real thing
about clowns.

613
00:35:33,618 --> 00:35:37,305
Well, hey, these are,
uh, really nice dolls.

614
00:35:37,389 --> 00:35:39,724
Did you paint
them yourself?

615
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:45,980
Oh.

616
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:48,016
Uh, friggin' Plucky.

617
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,800
Plucky helps kids.

618
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:51,769
It's all I ever
wanted to do.

619
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,439
And when the management slot
opened up, I...

620
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:59,077
But they passed me over.

621
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,811
Shocker.

622
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:04,749
No, I told them,
"No one cares more than me."

623
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:06,701
But suits never listen.

624
00:36:07,703 --> 00:36:09,370
So, I'm doing it my way.

625
00:36:09,455 --> 00:36:11,422
So let me
get this straight.

626
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,991
You didn't get
the good parking space,

627
00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:15,676
so you start
dropping bodies?

628
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,412
Those parents
were horrible.

629
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:19,047
They deserved
what they got.

630
00:36:19,131 --> 00:36:20,631
What about Saul?

631
00:36:20,682 --> 00:36:21,766
Saul had a big mouth!

632
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,771
Some guy hits on
the babysitter,

633
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:28,839
all of a sudden
he's the world's worst dad?

634
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:31,392
A good parent
puts his kids first.

635
00:36:31,477 --> 00:36:34,278
And having a little girl
watch her pop get ganked

636
00:36:34,346 --> 00:36:37,148
by the closet monster --
that's putting her first?

637
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,350
In the long run,
they'll all be better off.

638
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:40,485
You think so?
Really?

639
00:36:40,536 --> 00:36:42,036
<i>I</i> would have been.

640
00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:54,932
So, your brother.

641
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:58,086
What'd you do to him?

642
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,670
It's not my fault!
It's theirs!

643
00:37:06,228 --> 00:37:08,763
Looks to me
like he drowned.

644
00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:12,984
I was screaming...

645
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:14,986
But my folks...

646
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:16,771
They didn't listen.

647
00:37:16,855 --> 00:37:18,940
They never listened.

648
00:37:19,024 --> 00:37:19,857
It was an accident.

649
00:37:19,908 --> 00:37:21,526
They let him die!

650
00:37:25,998 --> 00:37:27,198
Ohh!

651
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:28,583
Yeah!
Ohh!

652
00:37:35,257 --> 00:37:37,425
I'll bet you still
have nightmares.

653
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:41,045
In fact, I'll bet you haven't
been in the water since.

654
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:41,846
Shut up!

655
00:37:41,913 --> 00:37:44,382
Because you're afraid.

656
00:37:47,386 --> 00:37:48,719
No!!

657
00:38:06,872 --> 00:38:08,573
It wasn't my fault.

658
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:11,459
I'm sorry.

659
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:09,820
Let's roll.

660
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:16,377
Go ahead. Say it.

661
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:19,613
I'm sorry.

662
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:24,869
You look like you got attacked
by some PCP-crazed strippers.

663
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:31,609
Dude, one of them sprayed me
with seltzer from his flower.

664
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:38,399
I'm s-- whew.

665
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:39,667
What?

666
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:41,035
Nothing.

667
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,019
Carry on.

668
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,204
Ohh.

669
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:44,738
That's...

670
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:46,523
Sam...

671
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:50,878
I'm sorry for...
psychologically scarring you.

672
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:53,297
Which time?

673
00:39:53,364 --> 00:39:54,632
Shut up. Seriously.

674
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:56,634
You know, me ditching you
when we were kids,

675
00:39:56,701 --> 00:39:57,835
that was a dick move.

676
00:39:57,886 --> 00:40:00,037
You know,
the whole clown thing...

677
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:02,006
You know what, man?
Honestly...

678
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:07,311
Getting my ass kicked
by those juggalos tonight was...

679
00:40:07,378 --> 00:40:08,596
It was therapeutic.

680
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,764
- You faced your fear.
- Exactly.

681
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:13,767
And now what else could a clown
possibly ever do to me?

682
00:40:13,852 --> 00:40:15,019
- I feel good.
- Well, congrats.

683
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,687
By the way,
to celebrate...

684
00:40:16,755 --> 00:40:18,739
What?

685
00:40:22,027 --> 00:40:23,027
- No!
- Yes.

686
00:40:23,078 --> 00:40:24,445
Did you win this?

687
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:25,412
We earned that.

688
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:27,414
Ha ha!

689
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:31,234
Hey. I got you a little
something, too, actually.

690
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:36,674
What? You said
you were over it.

691
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:39,426
You can think
of it as a...

692
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:42,296
clown phobia
sobriety chip.
