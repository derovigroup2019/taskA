Who the hell --
Leviathan!

3
00:00:10,788 --> 00:00:14,341
? Ridin' the storm out ?

4
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:17,227
? waiting for the fallout

5
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:22,065
? on a full-moon night in
the Rocky Mountain winter ?

6
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:25,485
? wine bottle's low

7
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:26,853
stay the hell away
from me.

8
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,739
Your world is whatever
I want it to be, understand?

9
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:31,024
Leave me alone!

10
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:32,308
Whoa! Whoa!

11
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,993
You want to know the truth?
You got away.

12
00:00:34,078 --> 00:00:36,296
We got you out, Sammy.
This is real.

13
00:00:36,363 --> 00:00:38,815
You need to see a fella
named Frank Devereaux.

14
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:39,849
Bobby Singer sent us.

15
00:00:41,485 --> 00:00:43,986
? Watching the full moon
crossing the range ?

16
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:46,322
You can't stop any of us.
We can't be killed.

17
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:48,124
These things are smarter
than you.

18
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:49,926
You don't have a clue
how to kill 'em

19
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:51,761
or slow 'em down,
and your plan is, what?

20
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:53,513
Go right at 'em?
Hello, boys.

21
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:55,181
Years of demons
nipping at your heels,

22
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:57,217
haven't seen one for months. Wonder why?
We've been busy.

23
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:59,419
Hunting Leviathan --
yes, I know.

24
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:01,020
You met that dick yet?

25
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:02,505
We should be friends,
you and I.

26
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:04,390
I'd never work with you,
Crowley.

27
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:07,861
Okay, you sons of bitches.
Let's see what you're up to.

28
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:08,812
Go! Go!

29
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:14,984
He's not gonna die.
It's <i>one</i> bullet.

30
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:16,453
He's gonna be fine
because he's always fine.

31
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,322
So maybe I'm not real,
but I'm not going anywhere, Sam.

32
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:20,323
His eyes are open.

33
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:21,324
Bobby?
Hey.

34
00:01:27,164 --> 00:01:28,498
Idjits.

35
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:33,386
Bobby?

36
00:01:46,183 --> 00:01:47,717
Thank you.

37
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:49,102
Sure.

38
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:51,020
You've been here a couple nights
in a row now.

39
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:54,607
What can I say?
I like the ambience.

40
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:57,243
Get you anything else?

41
00:01:57,311 --> 00:02:00,396
No, thanks.

42
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,666
Thanks.
Keep safe out there.

43
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,201
Hey, there.
You lost?

44
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:40,904
What?

45
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:45,658
- Excuse me...
- Ooh-hoo.

46
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:47,126
You're looking a little
cabo wabo, there.

47
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:49,612
No. No, I'm fine.

48
00:02:49,663 --> 00:02:51,080
No. You're not.

49
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:53,950
I slipped a little special sauce
into your coffee

50
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:55,301
while you were watching
the skirt.

51
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:58,120
You do know we're venomous,
right?

52
00:02:58,172 --> 00:03:01,174
Looks like I didn't dose you
quite hard enough.

53
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:02,291
That's okay.

54
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:03,893
There's more
where that came from.

55
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:14,020
That's for the crappy tip.

Dean, you know, um...

59
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:07,826
...I wonder if -- if we...

60
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:09,812
I mean, should we
be telling people?

61
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:11,179
I mean, people he knew.

62
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:13,649
How long ago did I give Frank
these numbers?

63
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:15,150
It's been a few weeks,
right?

64
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,403
What, is he nuts,
or is he just being rude?

65
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:21,707
Probably both.

66
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,877
Dean, I-I got
to ask you a question.

67
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:26,795
Unless, of course,
something happened to him.

68
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:29,031
He can't get to the phone because a
Leviathan ate his face.

69
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:30,249
Yeah,
also a possibility.

70
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,533
We should go check
on him.

71
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:35,003
Dean, do you want to call
Bobby's people or not?

72
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:36,538
W-why is that our job?

73
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:37,923
Because who else
is gonna do it?

74
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:41,710
I'm not calling anybody.

75
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,428
If you want to,
you go right ahead.

76
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:46,682
I don't want to call anybody.
You kidding me?

77
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,336
Well, I'm not getting it.

78
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,896
Hello?

79
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:03,699
Is Bobby Singer there?

80
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,667
Uh, no.
He's, uh...

81
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:09,755
I-I-it's not,
but I'm a friend of his.

82
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,175
My dad asked me to call
Bobby Singer specifically.

83
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:16,094
He's...Not here,
but, look, if you need s--

84
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:22,134
Who was it?

85
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:24,136
Just some kid.

86
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,355
For Bobby?

87
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:27,523
Girl scout cookies?

88
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,942
I think maybe...

89
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:31,910
Maybe a-a hunter's kid?

90
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:32,978
I mean, she sounded
pretty scared.

91
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:36,932
You know, I have a caller I.D.
Maybe we should go find her.

92
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:38,650
We can check on her.

93
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:40,101
What about Frank?

94
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:42,237
Well, Dean, I think we should
go find this girl first.

95
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:45,824
Sam, Frank's been working
on the numbers

96
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,659
that Bobby spent
his last breath on,

97
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:48,994
and you want to
back-burner that?

98
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,419
Fine. You go
check out girl scout.

99
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,804
I'll find Frank.

100
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:00,956
Fine. But you know what?
On one condition --

101
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,808
if Frank is just
spinning his wheels,

102
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:04,793
then you bail out on crazy
and come meet me.

103
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:08,313
And thanks for drinking
my entire beer.

104
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:10,465
I didn't touch your beer.
Mine's right there.

105
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:15,136
You probably drank it
without noticing.

106
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,457
Right.

107
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:42,764
Hello?

108
00:07:42,832 --> 00:07:46,385
Um, we...spoke
on the phone earlier?

109
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,524
Hi.

110
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:55,110
Uh...I'm Sam.

111
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:56,728
You sounded like
you needed help,

112
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:58,063
and I was in the area.

113
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:00,065
How'd you find me?

114
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,985
Your dad is in
Bobby's address book.

115
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:04,503
So where is he?

116
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,789
Bobby?

117
00:08:07,857 --> 00:08:09,858
He, uh...

118
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,860
He's passed away.

119
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:16,164
Look, um --

120
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:17,716
Krissy.
Krissy.

121
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,885
I get it.
You don't let strangers in.

122
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:22,437
But if your dad said
you could trust Bobby,

123
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:23,922
then you can
trust me, too.

124
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:32,981
Just so you know,
911's on speed-dial.

125
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,099
One button.

126
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:35,517
Yeah, sure.
Note taken.

127
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:44,109
So...

128
00:08:45,227 --> 00:08:46,445
...you're a salesman,
too?

129
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:47,696
Yep.

130
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:50,082
So your dad's on the road
right now?

131
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:53,502
Been gone a while?

132
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:55,253
He usually calls
every night.

133
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:56,505
How long has it been?

134
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:58,340
Five days.

135
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:02,527
It's just you and him,
huh?

136
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:07,466
I know how that is.

137
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,352
Look, um...

138
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:14,022
Sometimes on the road,
crap happens.

139
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,924
So I'll help you
track him down.

140
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:17,893
Really?
'Course.

141
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:20,729
Did he happen to say
where he was going?

142
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,698
Said he had a couple leads
near Dodge City.

143
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:24,182
And does he have a desk
or something

144
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,117
where he keeps his stuff?

145
00:09:38,214 --> 00:09:40,082
Do you mind
making some coffee?

146
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:45,587
Thanks.

147
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:14,116
Krissy.

148
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:17,836
Hey, listen, so I think I got
an idea where to start.

149
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,154
So I'm gonna go.

150
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:21,173
Um...Can I borrow this?

151
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:22,791
Yeah.

152
00:10:22,842 --> 00:10:25,010
Thanks.

153
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:26,211
Here.

154
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:27,729
Here's a number,

155
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:29,264
in case you don't hear from me
in the next couple days.

156
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:32,050
Don't worry.

157
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:33,802
I promise I'll check in.

158
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:37,272
Don't say that.
That's what my dad said.

159
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:11,006
This can't be good.

160
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:17,262
Well...Hi.

161
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,184
Frank...

162
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:24,569
We're amongst
friends here.

163
00:11:24,654 --> 00:11:27,355
Okay, acquaintances.

164
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:31,743
That's just what a Leviathan
would say.

165
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,962
Frank.
I'm not a Leviathan.

166
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:45,344
Oh, sure.
You're not a Leviathan.

167
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:47,746
Dick Roman's
not a Leviathan.

168
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:50,382
Gwyneth Paltrow
is not a Leviathan.

169
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,416
Yeah?

170
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,018
Trust me.

171
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,355
Okay.
You know what, Frank?

172
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:58,441
I think you've been doing
a <i>little</i> too much research.

173
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:00,092
They're anywhere, anyone.

174
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:01,794
Who's to say
this ain't the day

175
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:03,863
they come for old Frank
who knew too much?

176
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,784
They bleed black goo,
right?

177
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:10,603
You want to see
what I bleed?

178
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,155
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

179
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,242
Let's take the guns
out of it, okay?

180
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,544
Okay.

181
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,647
See?
Red-blooded American.

182
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,486
Now...

183
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,787
Your turn.

184
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:47,790
Oh! Whoa.
Look, I'm obviously not --

185
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:49,158
Fair's fair, douchebag.

186
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:01,653
Yeah.

187
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:03,289
I'm glad we could share
that together.

188
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,990
Grab your gun,
come with me.

189
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,675
For God's sake,
don't make any noise.

190
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:27,813
Why the downsize?

191
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,815
You!

192
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:32,284
"Hey, Frank, go dig up some dirt
on Richard Roman."

193
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:34,954
That night, I was burned off
every I.P. I had.

194
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:36,906
Ears on my phones,
eyes on my house...

195
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,457
Wait -- Dick's got people
watching you?

196
00:13:38,524 --> 00:13:39,959
Do I look like I know?

197
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:43,078
You think it's easy to see
this deep into what's real

198
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:45,881
and also be bipolar
with delusional ideation?

199
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:48,700
There is no pill for
my situation, sweetiepop,

200
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:51,670
so, yeah, best guess --
the bigmouths are onto me.

201
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:54,089
Next question.

202
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:56,008
All right. Well, what's the word
on the bigmouths?

203
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:58,377
Their tentacles are everywhere.

204
00:13:58,428 --> 00:13:59,812
I-I'm looking at bankers,

205
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,930
military high-ups...

206
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:02,348
This is why
you didn't call me back.

207
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,548
Hey, cut me some slack.

208
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,234
You called me
like four days ago.

209
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:07,386
I called you
four <i>weeks</i> ago, Frank.

210
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:09,405
What? No.

211
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:10,739
Really?

212
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:12,858
Days, weeks --
quit busting my chops.

213
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:14,109
What, are you kidding me?

214
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:15,244
You cool your heels,
Buster Brown.

215
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:17,162
Frank, I paid you 15 grand
for this.

216
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,564
- Yeah, I get that --
- No, you <i>don't</i> get that!

217
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:22,585
Dick Roman is every card
in my hit deck.

218
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:24,270
You understand that?

219
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:27,456
Those numbers, they got
something to do with him, okay?

220
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,258
Bobby <i>died</i>
<i>for those numbers.</i>

221
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:32,127
Look,
I'm sorry about Bobby.

222
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:33,846
I really am.

223
00:14:33,913 --> 00:14:37,266
You know, this one
time, we were in Fresno,

224
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,884
and we got stuck --

225
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:40,519
No. No, no, no.

226
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:41,753
I'm not gonna play

227
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:43,606
"this one time with Bobby" crap,
all right?

228
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,441
I'm not gonna get all warm
and fuzzy

229
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:47,092
with somebody else
who barely knew him.

230
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:49,094
Just trying to make
friendly conversation.

231
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:51,697
This is not a friendship, Frank.
I'm paying you!

232
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:54,599
Hey.
You know what you need?

233
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:56,952
A little LSD,

234
00:14:57,037 --> 00:14:58,570
a little shiatsu --
I'm out of here.

235
00:14:58,622 --> 00:15:01,624
Hey, you want to know
what those numbers are?

236
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,958
Bupkes.

237
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:04,960
They're not lottery numbers,
license --

238
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:06,996
I know that, Frank.
Thank you.

239
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,131
Which leaves us
little else to do

240
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:10,699
but probability generate.

241
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,636
Come again?

242
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,057
You run most
reasonable possibilities

243
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:20,592
for a levi-related
five-digit number

244
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:23,562
written by a dying drunk,
you come up flat.

245
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:25,764
Know what you start
to wonder?

246
00:15:25,815 --> 00:15:28,067
"Hey, maybe I'm missing
a number."

247
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:29,735
Well, how do you figure?

248
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:31,236
Oh, I don't know.

249
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:34,306
Because Bobby was dying
of brain trauma.

250
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:36,158
I just had a tickle
there was a reason

251
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:37,693
nothing was popping out
at us,

252
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:39,695
so I set up a program
to run possibilities

253
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,313
for six numbers,
seven, eight.

254
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:43,499
But good news.
<i>Good</i> news.

255
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,669
Never had to go past six,
because this...

256
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:51,156
...my little lamb,
is coordinates.

257
00:15:58,598 --> 00:15:59,848
Are you sure?

258
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:01,517
To what?

259
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:05,220
A field in Wisconsin.

260
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:07,439
No.

261
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,641
No, Bobby didn't
give us coordinates

262
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:12,010
to some patch of weeds
in cheeseville.

263
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:14,947
No, he gave you coordinates
to a parcel

264
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:17,616
recently purchased
by Willman, Inc.,

265
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:18,984
a subsidiary of...

266
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:22,687
...Richard Roman
Enterprises.

267
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,714
So what do we do?

268
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:33,698
Stay away.

269
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,720
Or, if we're stupid...

270
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:39,704
We go there
and set up surveillance.

271
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,348
Matthew Havlena --

272
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,683
found in a ditch
off the interstate.

273
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:53,051
Cause of death?

274
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:55,571
Missing five pints of blood
can't have helped.

275
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:56,739
Puncture wounds --

276
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:59,608
femoral arteries
and carotid.

277
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:00,943
So, what?
Some kind of animal attack?

278
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:02,161
Or a vampire.

279
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:07,666
Huh. That...usually gets
at least a chuckle.

280
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:14,406
Find Frank?

281
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:16,241
- Yeah. Those numbers?
- Coordinates.

282
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,177
Dick bought some land.
We're headed there now.

283
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:19,628
Wait, wait, wait.

284
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:21,213
- You're just gonna drive right up to --
- Relax.

285
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:23,098
It's a field,
not the death star.

286
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:24,583
Dick's at
a T.E.D. Conference.

287
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:26,468
It's all over
<i>The Huffington Post.</i>

288
00:17:26,553 --> 00:17:28,270
Wait, wait, wait.

289
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:29,588
Since when do you read?

290
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:30,922
Know your enemy, Sam.

291
00:17:30,974 --> 00:17:32,224
What's going on
with the girl?

292
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:33,809
I don't think she even knows
her dad's in the life.

293
00:17:33,893 --> 00:17:35,427
So far, I got three
missing truckers

294
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:36,562
and one blood-free body.

295
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:37,696
Good times.

296
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:40,199
All right, well,
keep me posted.

297
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:41,933
Got the equipment arranged.

298
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:44,553
Come and get your costume on.
We can scoot.

299
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:46,538
"Costume"?

300
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:48,373
What?

301
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:52,628
What the hell's so special
about this place?

302
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:53,779
I love a mystery.

303
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:55,130
Now get up
in that cherry picker

304
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:56,781
and act like
you're fixing something.

305
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:57,782
I don't know how
to drive that thing.

306
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,084
You think I do?

307
00:17:59,135 --> 00:18:01,804
Well, why do I got to be
the sap that --

308
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:04,256
this one says "manager."
That one says "technician."

309
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:06,175
Sometime this month?

310
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:13,816
Yah!

311
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,108
Whoo!

312
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:47,716
Come on down, Tarzan!

313
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,268
What?!

314
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:56,675
We need to move.

315
00:18:56,726 --> 00:19:00,729
They got this place
wired up the wazoo.

316
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:02,197
They're watching us
right now?

317
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:06,068
Nah, nah, they're just watching
Cheech and Ed from ma bell.

318
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:07,536
You know, it's gonna be
a little difficult

319
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,737
to set up surveillance
if there's,

320
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:09,955
uh, <i>surveillance</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

321
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:13,325
Right. So we need to tap
into theirs instead.

322
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,914
All right, now what?

323
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,382
You look horrific.

324
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:22,501
When was the last time
you really slept a night?

325
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:23,635
Let's just work,
all right?

326
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:24,720
This is it.

327
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:26,638
We watch the screens.

328
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:29,024
I can take
the first shift.

329
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:31,927
You're no use
if you can't even...

330
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:34,379
Keep your eyes open.

331
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:42,604
Dean, hey.

332
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:44,556
So I think this guy
was hunting a Vetala.

333
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:46,608
Dad took one down
back in the day.

334
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,160
Silver knife to the heart,

335
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:49,444
twist, they're done.

336
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:51,396
He says they're maladjusted
loner types --

337
00:19:51,447 --> 00:19:54,399
like to knock a guy out,
drag him home, feed slow.

338
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,368
So, if Krissy's dad
got grabbed,

339
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:58,921
there's a chance
he might still be alive.

340
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:02,958
It'd be nice to get this girl's
dad back home to her, you know?

341
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:04,793
All right,
I could use your help.

342
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:07,763
Call me.

343
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:14,052
Excuse me.

344
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,939
Your manager said that you might
be able to help me.

345
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,473
Sure.
What can I do for you?

346
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:22,060
You ever see this man?

347
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:25,814
I...might have served him
the other day.

348
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:30,435
I think he may have
gone to...

349
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:31,987
talk to that girl
out there.

350
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,794
Thanks.

351
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:43,715
Hey!

352
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:46,251
Can I talk to you
for a second, uh...

353
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:48,286
Sally?

354
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:51,056
You ever see this man?

355
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,260
You sure?

356
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:00,098
It's not safe here.

357
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:01,600
Somewhere private.

358
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,608
Something's happening
around here.

359
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,326
I'm afraid I'll be next.

360
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:12,995
Tell me what you saw.

361
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,614
I don't know what I saw.

362
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:23,088
Sally, run!

363
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:25,624
Ohh!

364
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,175
How long was I out?

365
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:56,411
'Bout 36 hours.

366
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:58,112
What?

367
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,931
Why didn't you wake me?

368
00:21:59,998 --> 00:22:01,282
Not your butler.

369
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,050
Come see this.

370
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:09,173
What?

371
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:11,676
This is where
it gets good.

372
00:22:11,743 --> 00:22:13,060
Frank,
you need to get out more.

373
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:15,129
Not that.

374
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:21,469
Check out Sarah Palin.

375
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:22,970
Who is she?

376
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:24,806
Amanda Willer.

377
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:27,008
Surprise, surprise --

378
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:28,960
works for Richard Roman.

379
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:30,745
What was she doing?

380
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:32,930
Being a naughty,
bossy little girl.

381
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:36,484
Well, I hate to ask for that
in the non-porno version.

382
00:22:36,552 --> 00:22:37,702
They're surveying.

383
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:38,836
They're getting ready
to build something.

384
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:40,438
- Build what?
- Exactly.

385
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:41,956
"What?"

386
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:43,090
No idea.

387
00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:44,125
Well,
how do we find out?

388
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:45,760
We watch.

389
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:47,628
Patience, grasshopper.

390
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,214
Yeah, patience and me
aren't exactly on terms.

391
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,383
Well, then go out
and kill something

392
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:54,802
or whatever you kids do
to blow off steam.

393
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:56,437
What, you don't like
my suggestion?

394
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:58,022
I don't think
you're in a position

395
00:22:58,106 --> 00:22:59,640
to be giving suggestions,
all right?

396
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:01,976
I think you're one tinfoil hat
away from a rubber room.

397
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,311
Did I mention
you look awful?

398
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:04,862
Yes.

399
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:06,631
Maybe because
somebody I cared about

400
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:08,015
just got shot in the head.

401
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:11,452
And this is like shoving a rock
up a hill.

402
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,404
And -- screw you.

403
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:15,356
Here's my advice
you didn't ask for -- quit.

404
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:16,741
What?!

405
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:18,209
You want to keep going?

406
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:20,044
I want Dick Roman
on a spit.

407
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:22,079
But you're gonna drive yourself
into the ground first.

408
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:23,030
Good plan.

409
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:28,386
I'm not gonna quit.

410
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,688
It's not even an option.

411
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:32,924
I'm not gonna walk out
on my brother.

412
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:35,426
Okay, then, fine.
Do what I did.

413
00:23:35,511 --> 00:23:37,645
- What?
- Go native?

414
00:23:37,712 --> 00:23:39,013
Stock up on C rations?

415
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:40,431
No, cupcake.

416
00:23:40,516 --> 00:23:42,350
What I did when I was 26

417
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:45,436
and came home to find my wife
and two kids

418
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:47,104
gutted on the floor.

419
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:51,075
Decide to be fine till the end
of the week.

420
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:54,728
Make yourself smile
because you're alive

421
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,730
and that's your job.

422
00:23:56,782 --> 00:23:59,534
Then do it again
the next week.

423
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,571
So fake it?

424
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:06,407
I call it
being professional.

425
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:10,511
Do it right,
with a smile,

426
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:13,014
or don't do it.

427
00:24:22,424 --> 00:24:25,726
<i>Dean, hey.</i>

428
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:28,195
<i>So I think this guy</i>
<i>was hunting a Vetala.</i>

429
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:30,281
<i>Dad took one down</i>
<i>back in the day.</i>

430
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:31,932
No, no, no.
Sam, that's <i>not</i> right.

431
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:33,401
What's the guff?

432
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,069
<i>...says they're maladjusted</i>
<i>loner types --</i>

433
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,071
<i>like to knock a guy out,</i>
<i>drag him home --</i>

434
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:39,240
Sam.

435
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,659
No. Who's this?

436
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:42,827
Who's <i>this?</i>

437
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:45,713
Sam told me to call

438
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,331
if I didn't hear anything
back from him.

439
00:25:06,902 --> 00:25:09,904
That ringing
in your ears --

440
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:12,640
it's from the venom.

441
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:13,824
Venom?

442
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:15,209
Yeah.

443
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:17,595
They hit you with some kind
of knockout juice.

444
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:21,415
You seem to be handling this
pretty well.

445
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:23,718
Yeah. Well, um...

446
00:25:23,785 --> 00:25:26,454
I was out there
looking for you.

447
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:27,788
Lee Chambers?

448
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:31,325
I'm a friend
of Bobby Singer's.

449
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:32,343
Krissy called.

450
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:33,694
She -- she's fine.

451
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:35,713
She is.
She's just worried about you.

452
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:41,118
So how do we
get out of here?

453
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:45,056
They'll be back
pretty quick here.

454
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,674
Just the two of them?

455
00:25:46,742 --> 00:25:48,609
Yeah, they're a tag team.

456
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:50,111
One of them
knocks you out.

457
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:52,179
The other one dumps your rig
or your ride

458
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,449
or whatever
miles down the road.

459
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:58,302
It's a pretty nice system
they got.

460
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,870
They've been draining you.

461
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:02,440
Yeah.

462
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:05,409
They tap you three, four times,
you're dead.

463
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:07,361
And let me tell you

464
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:09,580
You can't see...

465
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:11,532
You can't walk.

466
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:15,536
I thought they'd kill me
right off,

467
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:17,171
but they don't have to.

468
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:19,373
They got nothing
to worry about.

469
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,308
How many times
they fed on you?

470
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,114
Three.

471
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:33,721
Did Sam tell you
where he was going?

472
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:35,356
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

473
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:36,490
What did you tell him?

474
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:38,659
Uh...He checked
my dad's room.

475
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:39,910
There?
Yeah.

476
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:53,841
Look,
I really don't have time

477
00:26:53,908 --> 00:26:55,042
to hold your hand here,
so --

478
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:56,293
What are you saying?

479
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:58,262
I'm saying go wait
in the living room.

480
00:26:58,346 --> 00:27:00,097
Your dad may not
want you to know

481
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:01,549
every single thing
about him.

482
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:33,781
Where is it?

483
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:36,884
You mean everything about
the job my dad was working?

484
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:38,552
Sam said you didn't know.

485
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,139
<i>Sam</i> seemed competent,
so I figured, fine --

486
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:43,974
I'll do what my dad
always tells me to.

487
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:46,477
"Be a regular kid,
don't say anything,

488
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:48,646
"stay out of
the line of fire.

489
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,548
Let the adults
work it out."

490
00:27:50,615 --> 00:27:51,799
So much for that.

491
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,435
All right.

492
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:55,903
Hand it over.

493
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,772
Okay? I have had
a long, <i>long</i> week.

494
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,812
All right, I get it.
You're a tough kid.

495
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:08,816
But I'm trying to get Sam
and your dad back.

496
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:12,703
My dad left,
and he didn't come back.

497
00:28:12,788 --> 00:28:17,208
Sam left,
and <i>he</i> didn't come back.

498
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:21,161
I give you the info, you leave,
<i>you</i> don't come back.

499
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:22,096
I'm coming back.

500
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:23,347
I'm coming with you.

501
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:26,217
N-no. No.
Hell, no.

502
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:27,167
I'm coming!

503
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:29,937
Or you're not going.

504
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:34,225
Ow!

505
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:35,476
Now hand it over.

506
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:40,013
I can't.

507
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:41,148
I burned it.

508
00:28:41,216 --> 00:28:43,117
You what?

509
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:47,855
But lucky for you,
I memorized it all first.

510
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:57,665
Hey, I have a question.

511
00:28:57,716 --> 00:29:00,000
All right,
here's the deal.

512
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:01,368
I'm a fun guy.

513
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:03,053
I'm actually awesome.
Okay?

514
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:05,089
But right now,
I'm not in the mood.

515
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:07,207
I'm neck deep
in some serious crap,

516
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:09,176
and if this wasn't
an emergency,

517
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:11,712
I would drop your ass off
at the nearest mall.

518
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:13,347
What serious crap?

519
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:17,318
Revenge crap, all right?

520
00:29:17,385 --> 00:29:18,652
Now shut up.

521
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,856
Eat a cookie or something.

522
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,615
One thing doesn't
make sense, though.

523
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,617
My dad's
a pretty great hunter,

524
00:29:33,735 --> 00:29:36,120
and your brother's the size
of a car, so...

525
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:37,955
So how'd this thing
get 'em both?

526
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,128
Vetalas usually hunt
in pairs.

527
00:29:44,212 --> 00:29:46,630
Sam and your dad
both assumed

528
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:49,082
it was one thing
hunting solo.

529
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:50,968
Why'd they think that?

530
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:53,554
Because they had
the wrong info.

531
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:56,106
Or, best available.

532
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:58,142
Our dad took down a loner
years ago.

533
00:29:58,226 --> 00:29:59,526
Sam has his journal.

534
00:29:59,594 --> 00:30:02,112
Your dad must've been going
on the same facts.

535
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:03,864
And you know different
'cause...?

536
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:08,819
Because I hunted one
that turned out to be <i>two</i>

537
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:10,571
a couple years back.

538
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:12,373
And you never told Sam?

539
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,741
Wow, thanks.

540
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,876
How 'bout sharing <i>that</i>
<i>with the rest of the class</i>

541
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,378
so we don't all
get killed?

542
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:20,047
Sam was away at <i>Stanford,</i>
<i>smartass.</i>

543
00:30:20,114 --> 00:30:23,634
Sam went to college?

544
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:25,636
I thought you said your dad
was a hunter.

545
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,637
He <i>was.</i>

546
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:28,339
We <i>were.</i>

547
00:30:28,423 --> 00:30:30,424
Sam quit,
went to college.

548
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:43,404
You could, too, you know --
go to college.

549
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:46,440
Be a hunter/pediatrician.

550
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,118
Hunter day
at the all-you-can-eat.

551
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:00,904
How's everyone feeling?
Good?

552
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:04,258
Strong silent.
Fine.

553
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:07,077
I don't need much entertainment
with my meal.

554
00:31:14,636 --> 00:31:16,887
Hey, Sally,
uh, did I tell you

555
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:19,673
about the Vetalas
I took down in Utah?

556
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:21,141
Yeah.

557
00:31:21,192 --> 00:31:23,360
You remind me of them.

558
00:31:23,445 --> 00:31:26,313
Except they were
so much...younger.

559
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:31,652
I tied 'em up.

560
00:31:31,686 --> 00:31:33,821
Not because I had to.

561
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:36,290
More so...

562
00:31:36,357 --> 00:31:37,858
I could take my time.

563
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:40,227
- You're lying.
- No.

564
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:41,829
I just want you to know

565
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,581
how much I enjoyed cutting up your sisters.
Shut up!

566
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:47,468
Aah! Ohh!

567
00:31:58,379 --> 00:31:59,813
You ever actually work
with your dad?

568
00:31:59,881 --> 00:32:03,067
Sure. 'Course.

569
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:07,071
No, I mean work,
not shoot cans in the woods.

570
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:09,023
I mean,
I help all the time.

571
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:11,775
So, no.

572
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:15,679
Well, right about now,

573
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:18,449
your stomach should be
pretty knotted up.

574
00:32:18,516 --> 00:32:19,650
Not really.

575
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:22,619
Look, maybe this was a lot
harder for you

576
00:32:22,704 --> 00:32:23,954
when you were my age.

577
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:26,423
Oh, you think
you're a good actress.

578
00:32:26,508 --> 00:32:27,791
You're not.

579
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:29,209
What are you
talking about?

580
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,961
Well,
I hate to break it to you,

581
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:33,263
but it's all over your face --
you're scared.

582
00:32:33,348 --> 00:32:35,132
Quit treating me
like I'm some girl.

583
00:32:35,216 --> 00:32:38,469
I've been prepping for this
my entire life.

584
00:32:40,922 --> 00:32:42,923
Training's one thing.

585
00:32:42,974 --> 00:32:45,309
Doing --
whole nother beast.

586
00:32:45,393 --> 00:32:47,444
Wow. You really
scared me straight.

587
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:49,063
Thanks, Dean.

588
00:32:56,905 --> 00:32:59,957
Why is that waitress
getting into that truck?

589
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,576
I'm not explaining
the R-rated crap to you.

590
00:33:02,627 --> 00:33:05,195
The <i>front</i> of the truck,
not the back, Dean.

591
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:16,507
All right.

592
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,727
What century is this?

593
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:23,046
No one fist-bumps
anymore.

594
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:26,433
Come on. Give it up.
Good work.

595
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:28,769
You're a dweeb.

596
00:33:30,772 --> 00:33:32,356
What the hell?
I got an idea.

597
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,024
How 'bout you stay here?

598
00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:36,243
Oh, you jackass.

599
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,477
Yeah, well,
I'm the jackass

600
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:38,862
who ain't bringing a kid
in there, period.

601
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:40,080
Why?

602
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:41,999
I can do everything
you can do.

603
00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:44,334
I'll bring them back.
Trust me.

604
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:45,619
Please,
they're probably dead.

605
00:33:48,256 --> 00:33:49,206
You don't know that.

606
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,490
It's been days.

607
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,676
Probably just
a pile of meat.

608
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:54,878
I've seen it.

609
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:57,998
People die, Dean.

610
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:01,218
I watched my mom
get torn to shreds.

611
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:06,390
Let me go in there
and kill them.

612
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,630
No.

613
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:15,282
Sorry.
You're such a hypocrite.

614
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:17,534
How come you get to do it
and I don't?

615
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:18,902
Because I'm the grown-up!

616
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,241
Give it to me.

617
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:25,909
What?

618
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:28,045
Your lock pick.

619
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:30,530
I <i>will</i> frisk you.

620
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:35,669
Thank you.

621
00:35:00,778 --> 00:35:03,063
Good thing we picked up
a new one.

622
00:35:03,164 --> 00:35:05,115
This one's
about tapped out.

623
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,400
You want to
finish him together?

624
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:08,285
Sure.

625
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,423
Not so fast.

626
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:28,722
Dad, hold on --
I got you!

627
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:30,274
Krissy, no!

628
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:36,813
Let her go...

629
00:35:36,898 --> 00:35:39,233
Or little miss sunshine here
gets it.

630
00:36:00,316 --> 00:36:02,316
What were you thinking,
bringing her here?

631
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,764
Now drop the knife!

632
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,689
She's just a child.

633
00:36:16,756 --> 00:36:18,090
Let her go.

634
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:19,808
Yeah, I don't think
we'll be letting anyone go.

635
00:36:24,097 --> 00:36:25,731
Daddy...

636
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:26,949
It's okay, baby.

637
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:30,069
Everything's
gonna be fine.

638
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,621
All right.
Enough with the family bonding.

639
00:36:32,706 --> 00:36:33,906
It's time for you
to shut up.

640
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:36,125
Daddy, no!

641
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:37,910
Dean!

642
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:38,994
He can't help you.

643
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,246
No one can.

644
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:49,722
I guess I'll have
to help myself, then.

645
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:12,995
Bad actress, huh?

646
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,863
Yeah, I take it back.

647
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,293
Yeah, I was hoping
you'd stop by.

648
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:29,762
I wanted to thank you.

649
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:31,830
It's no problem.

650
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:33,999
No, you saved my life.
Krissy's, too.

651
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,771
Actually, uh
she kind of saved ours.

652
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:41,624
Don't thank us.
Quit.

653
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:45,427
Your daughter's
14 years old.

654
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:47,913
She's already a hunter
with a kill under her belt.

655
00:37:47,981 --> 00:37:49,448
I'm not trying
to be a dick,

656
00:37:49,515 --> 00:37:51,683
but what do you think that does
to her life span?

657
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,322
She could still be
a regular kid.

658
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:58,440
You know,
I got into this for a reason.

659
00:37:58,508 --> 00:37:59,959
I know.
Your family.

660
00:38:00,026 --> 00:38:02,544
That's the same reason
you should get out now.

661
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:04,246
I can't.

662
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:09,918
You ever know anyone
who left the life?

663
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:15,307
No.

664
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:17,059
They all get killed first.

665
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:27,770
Well, uh...

666
00:38:27,854 --> 00:38:29,388
We should probably
let you get some rest.

667
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:31,573
Yeah.

668
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:43,585
Dean!

669
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,872
Thanks for saying bye,
asshat.

670
00:38:46,923 --> 00:38:48,257
Oh, what?
Now you're sentimental?

671
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:49,675
No.

672
00:38:49,742 --> 00:38:51,010
Just wanted to tell you

673
00:38:51,077 --> 00:38:52,711
that you're kind of amusing
for an old man.

674
00:38:55,415 --> 00:38:56,932
How'd you get out
of them cuffs, anyway?

675
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:58,917
Girl's got to have
her secrets.

676
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:02,938
Bobby pin.

677
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:04,440
You know, you could've
gotten yourself killed.

678
00:39:04,524 --> 00:39:06,058
I saved your bacon.

679
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:07,309
My point stands.

680
00:39:09,062 --> 00:39:10,312
But yes.

681
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:14,900
So...
Guess I'm retiring --

682
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:16,735
one and done.

683
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:19,905
Really?
How you feel about that?

684
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:22,708
Who knows?

685
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,877
Maybe I'll go to Stanford
like Sam.

686
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:31,133
We're so lame.

687
00:39:31,217 --> 00:39:32,551
Yeah, we are.

688
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:33,919
Take care of yourself.

689
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:50,382
You know what?

690
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:51,600
Good for them.

691
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:54,052
Yeah.

692
00:39:54,103 --> 00:39:56,138
It's nice to walk away
from someone

693
00:39:56,222 --> 00:39:58,190
and feel like
they could be okay.

694
00:39:58,257 --> 00:40:00,359
How about you? How you doing?
You all right?

695
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:05,948
No.
I'm definitely not.

696
00:40:06,032 --> 00:40:08,784
But, you know,

697
00:40:08,868 --> 00:40:11,370
I mean, I think, maybe...

698
00:40:11,437 --> 00:40:13,372
I just want to work.

699
00:40:17,293 --> 00:40:18,460
Should I even ask?

700
00:40:19,946 --> 00:40:21,163
I'm fine.

701
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:23,332
"Fine," meaning...?

702
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:27,536
You're right.
We should just...

703
00:40:27,604 --> 00:40:29,087
Work, right?

704
00:40:30,807 --> 00:40:34,726
And figure out a way
to kick Dick Roman's ass.

705
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:37,796
Well, hey, we are
the professionals.
