1
00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:02,929
Crossroads are
where packs are made.

2
00:00:02,932 --> 00:00:05,132
- That's serious spellwork.
- Used to summon a demon.

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,000
These people are actually making
deals with the damned thing.

4
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:10,153
They're seeing Hellhounds --
demonic pit bulls.

5
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:12,516
You can control them?

6
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:14,885
Sic him, boy!

7
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:16,636
Garth finally got them
to his houseboat,

8
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:18,755
but Kevin's having a lot of trouble
reading their half of the tablet.

9
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,674
- So, what is that stuff out front?
- Goofer dust.

10
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:22,442
You boys think you know
something about something,

11
00:00:22,444 --> 00:00:23,810
but not goofer dust?

12
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:25,378
What is it?
Hoodoo.

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,263
Keeps out demons.

14
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:29,449
In the box is the key

15
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:32,235
to every object,
scroll, spell

16
00:00:32,237 --> 00:00:35,122
ever collected for thousands
of years under one roof.

17
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:37,791
It is the supernatural
mother lode.

18
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:39,326
If knowledge is power,

19
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:42,796
then this is the most powerful
place on earth.

20
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,741
Holy crap.

21
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:07,514
Holy crap!

22
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:16,506
Holy crap.

25
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:55,895
Hey, Mom.

26
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,649
Wow.

27
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:24,729
Memory foam --
it remembers me.

28
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,367
And it's clean, too.
There's no funky smell.

29
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:32,036
There's
no creepy motel stains.

30
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,708
Really?

31
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,244
Sorry.

32
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,631
I'm gonna go fix us
some grub.

33
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,330
What you reading?

34
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:17,632
Sort of, uh, everything.

35
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:18,783
Oh, good.

36
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:20,618
Somebody's gonna have to dig
through all this,

37
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,554
and it ain't gonna be me.

38
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:25,807
You made these?

39
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:28,143
We have
a real kitchen now.

40
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:31,062
I know. I-I just didn't think
you knew what a kitchen was.

41
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:34,682
I'm nesting, okay?

42
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:37,068
Eat.

43
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:44,576
Huh? Yeah.

44
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:46,528
Wow.

45
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,997
You're welcome.

46
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:56,120
Yo.

47
00:04:56,122 --> 00:04:58,039
Dean?
Come quick.

48
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,707
What?

49
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:01,376
Kevin?

50
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:02,710
Kevin?!

51
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:04,429
Something wrong?

52
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:08,099
Guess.

53
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,565
Kevin? It's us.

54
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:44,969
Found him.

55
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,373
Wow.
You look like hammered crap.

56
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,276
Yeah.

57
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:52,961
Are you sleeping?
Not really.

58
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:54,178
Are you eating?

59
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,880
Hot dogs, mostly.

60
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:57,849
Sure, yeah --
breakfast of champions.

61
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,601
Look, I'm gonna feel dirty
saying this,

62
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:02,103
but you might want a salad
and a shower.

63
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:05,773
I know, and I've been getting
bad headaches and nosebleeds,

64
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:08,409
and I think maybe I had
a small stroke.

65
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,278
But it was worth it.

66
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,113
What was worth it?

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,952
I figured out
how to close the Gates of Hell.

68
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:20,288
You --

69
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:24,509
Come here,
you smelly son of a bitch.

70
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:28,963
Okay, okay.
So, what does this mean?

71
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:32,183
What are we looking at?
It's a spell.

72
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:33,301
And?

73
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:36,271
And it's just a few words
of Enochian, but...

74
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:37,138
Oh, here we go.

75
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,473
...the spell
has to be spoken

76
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:41,192
after you finish
each of the three trials.

77
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:43,561
T-trials like,
uh, like "Law & Order"?

78
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:44,946
More like Hercules.

79
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:49,484
The tablet says, "Whosoever
chooses to undertake these tasks

80
00:06:49,486 --> 00:06:54,605
should fear not danger,
nor death, nor..."

81
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:57,659
A word I think means
getting your spine ripped out

82
00:06:57,661 --> 00:07:00,078
through your mouth
for all eternity.

83
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,663
Good times.

84
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:04,382
Basically,
God built a series of tests,

85
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:08,002
and when you've done all three,
you can slam the gates.

86
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:10,254
So, what --
God wants us to take the SATs?

87
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:13,624
I-I guess.
Uh, he works in mysterious ways.

88
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,093
Yeah,
mysterious, douche-y ways.

89
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:16,627
All right.
Where do we start?

90
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:18,930
I've only been able to crack
one of the tests so far,

91
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:20,565
and it's gross.

92
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:25,320
You've got to kill a hound
of hell and bathe in its blood.

93
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:26,521
Awesome.

94
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:27,638
Awesome?

95
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,606
Yeah.

96
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:30,908
Hey, if this means
icing all demons,

97
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,361
I got no problem
gutting some devil dog

98
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:35,446
and letting Calgon
take me away.

99
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:36,781
Where are
you gonna find one?

100
00:07:36,783 --> 00:07:38,866
Well, Hellhounds like to collect
on crossroads deals.

101
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,618
So all we got to do
is track down some loser

102
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,704
who signed over
his special sauce 10 years ago,

103
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:45,322
get between him
and Clifford the big dead dog --

104
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:46,507
easy.

105
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:47,825
Doesn't sound easy.

106
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:49,093
It's not.

107
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:51,045
Look, you get on the net --
see what you can dig up.

108
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:53,181
I'm gonna go for a supply run
because we need goofer dust,

109
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:54,549
and the kid needs to eat
something

110
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,334
that's not ground-up hooves
and pigs' anuses --

111
00:07:56,336 --> 00:08:00,972
not that there's
anything wrong with that.

112
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,812
Okay,
I feel a lot better.

113
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:15,236
Hey, Kevin, buddy,
you got to slow down.

114
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:16,454
Get some shut-eye.

115
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:17,521
Take a day off.

116
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:18,456
Open a window.

117
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,208
No.

118
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,745
You said nuking hell --
that's how I get out.

119
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:24,912
That's how I go home.

120
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:27,415
Right, it is,
but you can't live like this.

121
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:29,366
You think I want to?

122
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:30,635
I hate it here.

123
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:32,220
I can't leave because

124
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:34,922
every demon on the planet
wants to peel my face off.

125
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:37,374
I can't talk to anyone
except you guys or Garth,

126
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:39,093
when he swings by,
or my mom.

127
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:41,813
Right? And when she calls,
all she does is cry.

128
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:45,817
I just...

129
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:49,020
I need this to be over.

130
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:51,406
I know. I do.

131
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:52,890
But trust me on this --

132
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:55,660
this whole
"saving the world" thing --

133
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:58,112
it's a marathon,
not a sprint.

134
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:01,933
You got to take better care
of yourself.

135
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,737
Hey.

136
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:11,175
Did you know that there are,
like, 6,000 kinds of tomatoes?

137
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,213
Did you find anything?

138
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:17,581
Yeah,
demon signs, 10 years ago,

139
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,017
all centered
on Shoshone, Idaho.

140
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,254
Okay, well, big-time mojo
means a big-time freak.

141
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:24,806
So, anybody have a horseshoe
shoved up his ass?

142
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:27,091
That's one way of putting it.

143
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:31,462
Meet the Cassitys,
small-time farmers

144
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:34,282
who struck oil on their land
in February of '03,

145
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:36,317
which is weird
because geological surveys --

146
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:37,985
Yeah,
you had me at "weird."

147
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:39,537
All right.
We thinking deal?

148
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:41,255
Best lead we've got.

149
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:43,241
Well, let's go visit
the Beverly Hillbillies.

150
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:44,876
You stay here,
work on step number 2,

151
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,961
and, uh, if you come across
anything about Hellhounds,

152
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:48,112
drop a dime, okay?

153
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:50,281
'Cause between the --
the claws and the teeth

154
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:53,000
and the whole invisibility
thing, those bitches can be...

155
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:54,752
real bitches.

156
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:55,953
I got you a present.

157
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,342
The, uh, blue ones
are for the headaches,

158
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:03,961
and the Greens are for pep.

159
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:06,731
Don't O.D.

160
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,349
Thanks?

161
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:11,468
You sure about that?

162
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,154
Sam, we are
on the one-yard-line.

163
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:15,239
It is time
to play through the pain.

164
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:36,260
All right,
keep an eye out.

165
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:38,012
Anybody with a Hellhound
on their ass

166
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,163
is gonna be showing signs --

167
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:41,098
hallucinating, freaking out --
the usual.

168
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,183
And if we find someone?

169
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:44,018
You get 'em clear.

170
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,053
I spike fido.

171
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:48,856
The crowd goes wild.

172
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:57,148
Hey, pal,
who runs this joint?

173
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:01,018
You're looking at her.

174
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:05,790
You...own the ranch?

175
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,575
Nope,
just manage the property.

176
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:09,744
You guys here about the job?

177
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:12,079
How'd you guess?

178
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:13,881
We get
our share of drifters.

179
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:15,349
Ah.

180
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:16,467
Ever worked a farm before?

181
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:18,719
Definitely.

182
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:21,355
We're quick learners.

183
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:25,009
Ellie...who we got here?

184
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:27,428
I'm Dean. This is Sam.
Oh.

185
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,146
Carl Granville.
A pleasure.

186
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:31,882
Pleasure. So you're not a Cassity?
No, my wife is.

187
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:33,401
Her and her family
own the place.

188
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:36,354
I'm just one those, uh --
what you call 'em? --

189
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:38,489
trophy husbands.

190
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:42,193
So, we, uh,
hiring the fellas?

191
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:43,661
Not sure yet.

192
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:46,163
Oh, come on.
They seem like swell guys.

193
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:48,282
Well, he's right.
We're swell.

194
00:12:01,913 --> 00:12:04,432
You bed down in here.

195
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:06,183
Breakfast is at 5:00,
dinner is at 8:00,

196
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,751
and in between, you're mine.

197
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:09,186
Questions?

198
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,355
I miss my room.

199
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,225
We're good.

200
00:12:14,227 --> 00:12:17,828
Okay.
Job is yours if you want it.

201
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,698
But I better warn you --
it's crap work.

202
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:26,287
Crap --
she literally meant crap.

203
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,295
I hate you.

204
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:36,163
I don't care.
Do I look like a hippie?

205
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:38,115
Organic food is better
for the cattle.

206
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:42,887
My land, my animals, my money,
my way -- end of story.

207
00:12:48,478 --> 00:12:50,177
She's a real piece of work,
huh?

208
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:53,347
Alice Cassity's
a piece of something, all right?

209
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:56,150
But what are we gonna do?
She's the boss.

210
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:59,470
Drink?

211
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:06,027
So,
what are we thinking?

212
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:07,144
What, dealwise?

213
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:08,979
Well, Ellie's the help,
so that rules her out.

214
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:11,648
And Carl doesn't really seem
like the sell-your-soul type.

215
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,451
So, Alice?

216
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:14,669
Ding-ding-ding.

217
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:15,953
Should we talk to her?

218
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:19,540
Why? So she can lie to us
and then call the cops? No.

219
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:22,376
No, we're gonna have to go
stalker on this one, Sammy.

220
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,163
The whole horse?
Oh, yes.

221
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:27,664
Seriously?
Yes.

222
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:30,885
What does she --

223
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,190
Just a wolf.

224
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:37,308
Yeah.

225
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,010
Probably spooked the hell
out of the horses.

226
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:41,362
I should check on them.

227
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:43,230
Well, all right.
Hurry back.

228
00:13:43,232 --> 00:13:44,699
Okay.

229
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:16,097
No!

230
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:27,243
God almighty.

231
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:30,829
I'm sorry, Ellie.
Carl seemed like a good guy.

232
00:14:30,831 --> 00:14:33,365
The best.

233
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:38,787
You say his head
was practically ripped off?

234
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:40,339
And you are?

235
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:41,957
Just curious.

236
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,575
He's new.
He works here.

237
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:46,378
Carl died bad --
let's leave it at that.

238
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,731
They've been reintroducing
wolves 'round these parts,

239
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,633
but I never thought...
This wasn't a wolf.

240
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:54,687
I got to make
some phone calls.

241
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,422
The whole family's
flying in for this.

242
00:14:57,424 --> 00:15:00,592
All the Cassitys
under one roof.

243
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:02,895
Good luck.

244
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:09,201
Oh, son of a bitch.

245
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:11,537
So, what do you think?

246
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:14,406
I think Carl signed the deal,
and now he's dog food.

247
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:16,158
Hellhound's gone,
and we were too busy

248
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,328
chasing a pile of Jack
to stop it.

249
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,880
Let's grab our stuff
and get out of here.

250
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:43,068
You okay, Mrs. Cassity?

251
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,269
Fine.

252
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:45,571
You sure?

253
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:48,407
I really am.

254
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:53,662
And...I know I shouldn't be
because I loved Carl...

255
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:54,963
I think.

256
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:56,732
I just can't remember why.

257
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:01,486
What do you mean?

258
00:16:01,488 --> 00:16:05,124
I mean...
Carl grew up around here.

259
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:07,626
We went to school together, and
he was always mooning over me.

260
00:16:07,628 --> 00:16:12,297
But I never --
I used to make fun of him.

261
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:14,550
When did you two
get together?

262
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:17,636
Valentine's Day, 2003.

263
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:19,138
I was at this party.

264
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,672
Carl was there,
and it was like

265
00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:22,408
I was seeing him
for the first time.

266
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,512
You know, suddenly he was cute
and smart and funny.

267
00:16:27,514 --> 00:16:31,116
It was magic.

268
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:34,403
Carl and I were happy
for 10 years.

269
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:39,191
Now he's dead,
and I'm not sad or angry.

270
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:42,044
I'm just...fine.

271
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,788
Hey, we, uh,
we have any graveyard dirt?

272
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:53,288
We should. Why?

273
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,373
Yarrow?

274
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,757
Yeah. No.

275
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,976
Dean, no.

276
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:59,678
We're not summoning
a crossroads demon.

277
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,930
Plan "A" bombed,
so welcome to plan "B" --

278
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:03,882
we get some red-eyed bitch
in a trap,

279
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:06,334
then we hold a knife on her
until she calls us in a pooch --

280
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:07,636
special delivery.

281
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:09,471
Yeah, except when Crowley
finds out we're dialing up hell,

282
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:12,024
he won't send one Hellhound --
he'll send a hundred.

283
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:14,026
That's not a plan, Dean --
that's suicide.

284
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:15,510
Well,
you got a better idea?

285
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,612
Yeah, we stay here.

286
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:19,398
I just talked to Alice
in the barn.

287
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,184
Carl didn't sell his soul
for oil -- he sold it for Alice.

288
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:24,753
His wife?

289
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:27,355
He loved her, she barely noticed
him, so he made a deal.

290
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:28,356
And now that time's up,

291
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,225
it's like
she barely even knew the guy.

292
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:33,194
You think our demon signed up
more than one schmuck

293
00:17:33,196 --> 00:17:34,496
while he was in town?

294
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:35,597
Wouldn't be the first time.

295
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,299
Look, Dean,
this family's rich

296
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:39,751
because someone booked
a one-way ticket downstairs.

297
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:42,938
And as of tomorrow,
they're all gonna be right here.

298
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,224
And you want to
scope 'em out?

299
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:49,010
I want to kill a Hellhound
and not die.

300
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:50,312
How 'bout you?

301
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:59,688
Two days --
then we do it my way.

302
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,574
Meet Noah Cassity.

303
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,793
He's 71,
worth a billion,

304
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:25,881
and just married wife number 5,
a 20-year-old lingerie model.

305
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:27,232
'Cause they have
so much in common?

306
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:30,469
Alice is his oldest, and that's
Cindy, the middle girl.

307
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:33,772
She had a single on the country
chart a few years ago.

308
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:35,640
Then she started hitting
the bottle,

309
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:36,925
and, well...

310
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,427
Her last album was a bunch
of holiday songs for dogs.

311
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:42,280
My favorites
were "Jingle Bark Rock"

312
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:44,533
and "Don't Pee on this Tree:
Happy Arbor Day."

313
00:18:44,535 --> 00:18:45,867
So she's the devil.

314
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:47,268
Pretty much.

315
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:50,405
And there's the baby --
Margot.

316
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:53,208
She ran away just before Alice
and Carl tied the knot,

317
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,910
lives in Paris.

318
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:56,128
How do you know all this?

319
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,381
I've been working on this farm
since I was 13,

320
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:00,916
and I've got eyes.

321
00:19:02,468 --> 00:19:06,555
Okay, tonight is
an all-hands-on-deck situation.

322
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:08,340
I'm gonna need
one of you inside,

323
00:19:08,342 --> 00:19:11,125
serving dinner
and pouring drinks --

324
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:12,961
a lot of drinks.

325
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:16,598
Okay. Well, have fun.
I won't wait up.

326
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,402
And somebody's gonna man
the grill.

327
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:22,070
What kind of grill?

328
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:28,660
Impressed?

329
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:32,364
I do like a man
who can handle his meat.

330
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:43,258
Really?

331
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
Keep it coming, Ken doll.

332
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:51,933
You're the best, Ellie.

333
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,387
Al,
I'm so sorry about Carl.

334
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:58,356
I mean,
he was the love of your life.

335
00:19:58,358 --> 00:19:59,558
Right.

336
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,142
Please,
she can do better.

337
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:02,694
Maybe Alice
should marry a child --

338
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:04,079
take after her father.

339
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:05,947
Ivanka's not a child.
Right.

340
00:20:05,949 --> 00:20:08,433
She's a prostitute
who looks like a child.

341
00:20:08,435 --> 00:20:10,151
Are you done?
Alice is in mourning.

342
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:12,287
Oh, I'm sorry, Margie.

343
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:15,073
I didn't see you there -- you're
too far up on your high horse.

344
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,410
Oh, yes,
but you are right --

345
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:21,963
we should all take a minute
and say a few words about Carl.

346
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:23,215
You first.

347
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:25,083
Was he a good lay?

348
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:27,802
What?

349
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:29,004
Oh, you didn't know?

350
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:31,423
Yeah, daddy caught 'em
going at it in the barn.

351
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:36,478
Al, it was
before you two got together.

352
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,347
I mean, Carl --
he loved you.

353
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:43,384
Yeah, that was back when Margie
was fat and Cin was sober,

354
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:44,769
a long time ago.

355
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:46,488
Get cancer and die,
old man.

356
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,156
You first, sweetie.

357
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:50,892
Are they
always like this?

358
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:51,860
More or less.

359
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:53,361
How can you work here?

360
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:55,830
I love the property,
I love the animals,

361
00:20:55,832 --> 00:20:57,532
and I tune out the people.

362
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:00,285
Well,
I can't remember the last time

363
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,203
we all sat down
and had a meal together.

364
00:21:02,205 --> 00:21:04,506
It was back at the old,
crappy house,

365
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:07,626
when daddy invited that
traveling salesman to dinner.

366
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:09,694
Oh, him.

367
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:11,012
He was so charming.

368
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:11,963
Yeah, English.

369
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:14,266
What was his name -- Kenny?

370
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:15,917
Crow--
Crow--

371
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,018
hmm?

372
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,270
Crowl--
Crowl--

373
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:20,021
Crowley?
Crowley.

374
00:21:24,143 --> 00:21:25,977
Crowley?
That's what they said.

375
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:28,280
Apparently, he swung through
town 10 years ago, to the day.

376
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:30,315
So, what -- do you think tea
and crumpets made these deals

377
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:31,650
and now he's collecting?

378
00:21:31,652 --> 00:21:34,119
Or he just sent his dog --
told it to go fetch.

379
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:35,197
Dude's king of hell. Grabbing
a few souls --

380
00:21:35,222 --> 00:21:36,906
that's got to
be below his pay grade.

381
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:38,265
I guess. Any idea who signed
the dotted line?

382
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,709
I have no clue.

383
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,875
It's brutal in there.

384
00:21:42,162 --> 00:21:44,296
Hey, Kev, what's up?

385
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:48,383
Hey, Dean, good news,
uh, I think...kind of.

386
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:50,085
Don't oversell it.

387
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:51,452
Sorry.

388
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:54,139
Um, I found something on the
tablet, uh, about Hellhounds.

389
00:21:54,141 --> 00:21:55,957
Uh,
this mean anything to you --

390
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,526
"the dire creatures may be seen
only by the damned

391
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:01,062
or through an object scorched
with holy fire"?

392
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:02,247
Like with holy oil?

393
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:03,464
It's got to be.

394
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:05,066
We could use a window.

395
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:06,518
Or glasses.

396
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:09,470
I think we've still got some
Jesus juice left in the trunk.

397
00:22:09,472 --> 00:22:11,305
All right, I'll take care
of the, uh, the X-ray specs.

398
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:14,159
You stay here. Do not let J.R. and
the gang out of your sight, all right?

399
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:16,528
Right. Hey, Kevin, uh,
you did great, man.

400
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,495
Get some sleep.

401
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:19,247
Okay. Tha--

402
00:22:43,172 --> 00:22:47,976
Oh, look.
Daddy's drunk <i>and</i> armed.

403
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:49,894
Must be Christmas.

404
00:22:57,686 --> 00:23:00,372
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

405
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:01,689
Where are you going?

406
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:03,792
Wherever
I damn well please.

407
00:23:03,794 --> 00:23:06,294
The wolf that killed
my son-in-law --

408
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:08,747
he's a man-eater,
got to be put down.

409
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:10,031
Doing this for Carl.

410
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,666
Okay, just -- just hold on
a second.

411
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:12,967
No, going now.

412
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:15,420
I'll come with you.

413
00:23:15,422 --> 00:23:19,307
You know anything
about hunting, boy?

414
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:22,060
A little bit, yeah.

415
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:31,552
Let's do it.

416
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:04,352
I like it...

417
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,974
...the whole Clark Kent
look.

418
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:11,943
Ellie, hey.

419
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:15,146
Hey.

420
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:16,815
So...

421
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:20,285
I think
you're really hot.

422
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:25,707
You want to go to my room
and have sex?

423
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,210
What?

424
00:24:29,212 --> 00:24:30,778
I -- sorry.

425
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,465
I don't usually do this.

426
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:36,885
I guess
I'm feeling my oats.

427
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:39,170
I can't.

428
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:43,675
What?

429
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:47,896
Okay.

430
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:50,315
Uh, embarrassing.

431
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:52,300
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want to.

432
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:53,852
Believe me.

433
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,987
No, it's okay --
you don't.

434
00:24:55,989 --> 00:24:57,405
I guess I'm gonna...

435
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:59,433
Ellie, um...

436
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:01,884
Rain check?

437
00:25:01,886 --> 00:25:04,804
This is one night only.

438
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:06,856
Sorry.

439
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:06,916
Watch yourself, boy.

440
00:26:06,918 --> 00:26:08,484
Where's Margie?

441
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:09,869
I thought she was with you.

442
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:11,671
Aah!

443
00:26:11,673 --> 00:26:15,091
Aah!

444
00:26:18,013 --> 00:26:19,846
Oh, my God! No!
Go back to the house.

445
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:22,799
Go! Move!
No!

446
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:36,774
What was that thing?

447
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:38,376
It was a Hellhound.

448
00:26:38,378 --> 00:26:40,111
See, when you sell your soul
to a demon,

449
00:26:40,113 --> 00:26:42,130
they're the ones that come
and rip it out of you.

450
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:43,114
Demon?

451
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:45,183
Crowley.

452
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:48,053
Poncey guy, about yea big,
mountain of dicks.

453
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:51,506
We know he was here 10 years
ago, making dreams come true.

454
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:53,008
Now,
if you didn't sign, great.

455
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,826
That freak out there
won't touch you.

456
00:26:54,828 --> 00:26:57,429
But if you did, I need to know,
and I need to know now.

457
00:26:57,431 --> 00:26:59,631
So, hands up.

458
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:00,599
So, wait.

459
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:02,784
T-the British guy
was a demon,

460
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:05,487
and now there's a Hellhound
after us?

461
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:06,771
A-are you insane?

462
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:08,740
They're obviously insane.

463
00:27:08,742 --> 00:27:10,158
Don't play dumb.

464
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,278
Yeah. I'm not playing.
I didn't sell my damn soul.

465
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,863
Well, somebody did,

466
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:16,064
and the sooner
that idiot owns up,

467
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:18,066
the sooner
the rest of you can go.

468
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:23,038
All right, seal 'em in.
Yeah.

469
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,156
What?!
Look, I'm gonna spread goofer dust

470
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:27,309
around the doors,
the windows.

471
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:30,095
That will keep the Hellhound
out...for a while.

472
00:27:30,097 --> 00:27:32,330
What is that -- how long?

473
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:34,266
Long enough for me to stab it
in its throat.

474
00:27:34,268 --> 00:27:36,834
No way. No way.
You can't do this.

475
00:27:36,836 --> 00:27:38,603
You can't --
Yes, I can. You want to know why?

476
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:41,439
Because it's what I do.
And, buddy, I'm the best.

477
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:43,675
See,
I gut old yeller out there,

478
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:46,394
and maybe -- just maybe --
you walk away.

479
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:48,997
I don't -- you're meat.

480
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:53,285
So, sit down, shut up...

481
00:27:53,287 --> 00:27:56,854
And put these on.

482
00:28:02,878 --> 00:28:05,363
I don't...

483
00:28:05,365 --> 00:28:06,665
Who are you people?

484
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:08,833
We're here to help.

485
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:11,419
Like you helped Margie?

486
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:13,254
When the Hellhound
gets close,

487
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:15,873
you might start seeing things,
hearing things.

488
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,509
It's gonna feel like you took
the brown acid,

489
00:28:17,511 --> 00:28:19,311
and it's trying to kill you.

490
00:28:19,313 --> 00:28:20,996
The handcuffs are
so you won't hurt yourselves.

491
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:22,647
And when one of you
starts bugging out,

492
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:25,266
we'll know who's on tap
to be puppy chow.

493
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:43,168
So...what's our play?

494
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,920
Well, you camp here, figure out
who whored their soul.

495
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:47,589
I'm gonna go scout
the grounds --

496
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:49,457
see if I can't gank
Huckleberry Hound

497
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:50,875
before he makes
his next move.

498
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:52,594
Wait, you're not going alone,
Dean.

499
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:54,129
I'm gonna come with you.
Wrong.

500
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:56,881
Uh, they're on lockdown,
and you need backup.

501
00:28:56,883 --> 00:28:58,583
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

502
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:00,885
No, I need you to be safe,
Sam, okay?

503
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:02,754
That's what I need.
What?

504
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:06,224
What am I --
when are <i>we</i> ever safe?

505
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:08,727
This is different.

506
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:09,911
How?

507
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:14,098
Because
of the three trials crap --

508
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,234
God's
little obstacle course.

509
00:29:16,236 --> 00:29:19,037
We've been down roads like this
before, man --

510
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,874
with Yellow-Eyes, Lucifer,
dick friggin' Roman.

511
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:26,828
We both know where this ends --
one of us dies...

512
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,213
Or worse.

513
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:30,799
So, what -- you just up
and decided it's gonna be you?

514
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:33,618
I'm a grunt, Sam.
You're not.

515
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,199
You've always been the brains
of this operation.

516
00:29:35,224 --> 00:29:35,755
Dean --

517
00:29:35,756 --> 00:29:38,957
And you told me yourself
that you see a way out.

518
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:42,177
You see a light at the end
of this ugly-ass tunnel.

519
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,628
I don't.

520
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,980
But I tell you
what I do know --

521
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:49,601
it's that I'm gonna die
with a gun in my hand.

522
00:29:49,603 --> 00:29:52,320
'Cause that's
what I have waiting for me --

523
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:54,606
that's all I have
waiting for me.

524
00:29:54,608 --> 00:29:57,141
I want you to get out.

525
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:58,976
I want you to have a life --

526
00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:01,496
become a man of Letters,
whatever.

527
00:30:01,498 --> 00:30:05,250
You, with a wife and kids and --
and -- and grandkids,

528
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:08,986
living till you're fat and bald
and chugging Viagra --

529
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:10,755
that is my perfect ending,

530
00:30:10,757 --> 00:30:13,825
and it's the only one
that I'm gonna get.

531
00:30:13,827 --> 00:30:17,011
So I'm gonna do
these trials.

532
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:21,999
I'm gonna do them alone --
end of story.

533
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,835
You're staying here.
I'm going out there.

534
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:26,755
If landshark comes knocking,
you call me.

535
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:29,707
If you try to follow me,

536
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:32,811
I'm gonna put a bullet
in your damn leg.

537
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:56,534
? I want you to love me

538
00:30:56,536 --> 00:31:00,638
? when I feel down,
I want you above me ?

539
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,590
? I search myself

540
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:04,759
? I want you to find me

541
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:06,561
? I forget myself

542
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:10,682
? I want you to remind me

543
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:14,769
? I don't want anybody else

544
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:18,656
? when I think about you,
I touch myself ?

545
00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:21,893
? oh-oh-oh, I don't want a--

546
00:31:21,895 --> 00:31:23,194
You sold your soul.
Admit it.

547
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:24,579
Why the hell
would you think that?

548
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:25,830
'Cause you're
a walking corpse,

549
00:31:25,832 --> 00:31:27,248
and you're married
to a centerfold.

550
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,333
I did the math.

551
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:31,202
She likes money,
and I'm rich. Do it again.

552
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:34,205
You sing like crap,
so explain the music career.

553
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:35,790
Hello -- auto-tune!

554
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:37,575
All right.
That's enough.

555
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:39,928
Oh, is it, four-eyes?
Is it enough?

556
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,263
I don't know why you even think
one of us made a deal.

557
00:31:42,265 --> 00:31:44,516
Because you struck oil
where there was no any oil.

558
00:31:44,518 --> 00:31:46,401
That didn't seem weird
to you?

559
00:31:47,353 --> 00:31:49,470
Margie.

560
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:50,755
Margie used to say that --

561
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:54,726
that if we were rich,
we'd all be happy.

562
00:31:54,728 --> 00:31:58,196
Right.
We're the damn Waltons.

563
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:01,149
? I'd get down on my knees

564
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:04,953
? I'd do anything for you

565
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:09,307
? I don't want anybody else

566
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:13,044
? when I think about you,
I touch myself ?

567
00:32:13,046 --> 00:32:16,414
? oh-oh-oh, I don't want an--

568
00:32:18,418 --> 00:32:21,252
Just in time.

569
00:32:21,254 --> 00:32:22,921
Ellie, are you okay?

570
00:32:22,923 --> 00:32:24,589
I'm good.

571
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:26,474
And I bet you're great.

572
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:31,763
Yep, great.

573
00:32:31,765 --> 00:32:33,815
Okay.

574
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:35,350
Listen...

575
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:38,186
Okay, whatever happens,
whatever you hear,

576
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:41,105
you need to stay in here
with that door locked.

577
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:42,156
Sit tight, okay?

578
00:32:42,158 --> 00:32:43,641
This is gonna sound crazy,

579
00:32:43,643 --> 00:32:46,010
but there is something evil
out there.

580
00:32:46,012 --> 00:32:48,830
I know.

581
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:51,249
You know?

582
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:54,836
It's coming for me.

583
00:33:09,544 --> 00:33:11,495
I need to take a leak.

584
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,473
Hold it.

585
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:14,758
Yeah, at my age?

586
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,176
Not really an option,

587
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:18,461
so either you let me go
or get me a bottle.

588
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,347
Ugh.
You're disgusting.

589
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,648
Wait!

590
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,502
No!

591
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,208
No, no, please.

592
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,660
Just let me go, please.
Please.

593
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:53,380
No!

594
00:33:53,382 --> 00:33:55,348
Please,
don't hurt my family.

595
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,802
I'm not.
I'm trying to help you.

596
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,256
Get in the house.

597
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:05,108
What? What?
Go!

598
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,943
Oh, God!
Go!

599
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:14,834
When my parents split up,
my mom took a job here.

600
00:34:14,836 --> 00:34:17,954
This was before
the Cassitys had money,

601
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:20,189
but it was
the best she could do.

602
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,025
So I grew up
on this farm.

603
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,077
That's
how you met Crowley?

604
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,679
They had this big dinner,

605
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:28,248
and after,
I saw him kissing Margie.

606
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,835
I ran.
I didn't know what to do.

607
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:35,755
But Crowley found me.
We talked.

608
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:37,757
He seemed so nice.

609
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:39,442
The best con men always do.

610
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,429
He asked me, if I had one wish,
what would it be?

611
00:34:42,431 --> 00:34:44,898
So I told him.

612
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,399
And he made you sign over
your soul.

613
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,684
He didn't make me do
anything.

614
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:51,154
My mom --
she had Parkinson's --

615
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:56,392
early stages, and I knew
how that story would end.

616
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,062
So I took the deal.

617
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:03,900
Ma is retired down in Phoenix
now, plays golf every day.

618
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,702
That was a stupid move,
Ellie.

619
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,237
I did it for my mom,
Dean.

620
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,522
What would <i>you</i> do
for your mom?

621
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:13,226
You had to know
this was coming.

622
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:14,494
No. How?

623
00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:17,414
Crowley didn't tell you about
the 10-year ticking clock?

624
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:18,932
What?

625
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:21,051
I knew that when I died,
I wasn't going to heaven,

626
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:24,437
but he never said anything
about that or monsters.

627
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:25,689
What a douche bag.

628
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:28,925
He probably didn't say jack
to Carl or Margot, either.

629
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,394
Margie made a deal?

630
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,929
So she's...

631
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,181
She's gone.

632
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:38,601
Oh, God.

633
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,537
I...

634
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,505
A few years ago,
Carl got drunk.

635
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,542
He told me did some kind
of magic at a crossroads --

636
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:49,112
summoned a demon.

637
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,380
I put two and two together,

638
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:53,767
and when I saw what that thing
did to him...

639
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:56,503
I just never knew
about Margie.

640
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:58,221
I thought I was next.

641
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,807
And you didn't run?
Where would I run?

642
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:05,979
All I wanted was one last meal,
some good tunes, and maybe...

643
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,470
I don't want to die.

644
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,368
Dean, what's happening?

645
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,820
Ellie, whatever you're seeing,
it's not real.

646
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,490
It means the Hellhound --
it's close.

647
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:40,274
Look, you need to stay
inside this circle, okay?

648
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,824
Now.

649
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,524
Dean...

650
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:47,026
No matter what happens,
you stay inside that circle.

651
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:48,227
You understand me?

652
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:30,052
Oh,
so <i>you're</i> Crowley's bitch.

653
00:37:30,054 --> 00:37:33,606
I guess pets really do look like
their owners.

654
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:38,778
What are you waiting for?

655
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,662
Come and get it!

656
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:15,981
Ohh!

657
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:43,777
Mnh.

658
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,906
You need to go
to a hospital.

659
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:47,291
Oh, I've had worse.

660
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,584
Yeah, he's had worse.

661
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,253
So, what now?

662
00:38:53,255 --> 00:38:57,674
Now we make a hex bag,
and you start running.

663
00:38:57,676 --> 00:38:58,792
If Crowley can't find you,

664
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,044
then he won't be able to sic
another mutt on you.

665
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:03,130
So I'm not going
to hell?

666
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,081
Not on my watch.

667
00:39:06,384 --> 00:39:08,101
Will you give us a minute?

668
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:09,937
Sure.

669
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:11,555
Thanks.

670
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,262
Dean,
even if she can dodge Crowley,

671
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:21,931
as soon as Ellie dies,
her soul is earmarked for hell.

672
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:24,651
Not if we shut it down
first.

673
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,606
The spell's not gonna work
for you, Dean.

674
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:37,297
Kah-nuh-ahm-dahr.

675
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:44,304
Doesn't matter.

676
00:39:44,306 --> 00:39:46,790
We'll track down another
Hellhound, and <i>I'll</i> kill it.

677
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:48,141
No.

678
00:39:48,143 --> 00:39:51,261
Sam,
I didn't pass the test.

679
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,647
But <i>I</i> did...

680
00:39:53,649 --> 00:39:55,182
And I'm doing
the rest of them.

681
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,100
My ass you are!

682
00:39:57,102 --> 00:39:58,702
I'm closing the gates.

683
00:39:58,704 --> 00:40:01,104
It's a suicide mission
for you.

684
00:40:01,106 --> 00:40:03,857
Sam...
I want to slam hell shut, too, okay?

685
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,609
But I want to survive it.

686
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,311
I want to live,
and so should you.

687
00:40:08,313 --> 00:40:11,981
You have friends up here,
family.

688
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:14,418
I mean, hell, you even got
your own room now.

689
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,887
You were right, okay?

690
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:20,257
I see light at the end
of this tunnel.

691
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:23,493
And I'm sorry you don't --
I am.

692
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:25,095
But it's there.

693
00:40:25,097 --> 00:40:29,599
And if you come with me,
I can take you to it.

694
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:30,584
Sam, be smart.

695
00:40:30,586 --> 00:40:33,303
I <i>am</i> smart,
and so are you.

696
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,938
You're not a grunt, Dean.

697
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,174
You're a genius --
when it comes to lore, to --

698
00:40:38,176 --> 00:40:40,277
you're the best damn hunter
I have ever seen --

699
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:42,896
better than me,
better than dad.

700
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,799
I believe in you, Dean.

701
00:40:45,801 --> 00:40:48,685
So, please --

702
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:53,407
please believe in me,
too.

703
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:15,879
Kah-nuh-ahm-dahr.

704
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:19,316
Sam.

705
