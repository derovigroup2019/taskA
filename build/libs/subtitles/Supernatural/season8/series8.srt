1
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:07,650
You have no one at all,
right?

2
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:13,323
My husband. He died
in Afghanistan eight months ago.

3
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:16,559
Cass.
Hello, Dean.

4
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:18,895
Getting me out of Purgatory
wasn't your responsibility.

5
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:21,681
I pulled away.
I needed to do penance.

6
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,484
For the things I did
on earth and in heaven.

7
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:27,854
How...the hell
did you make it out?

8
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:31,524
My name is Naomi.
We rescued you.

9
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:34,194
Consider these chats
your repayment.

10
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:36,329
You will report in
to me regularly,

11
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:38,498
and you will never remember
having done so.

12
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:51,210
Gary?

13
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,880
Olivia.

14
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,885
After last time, I-I didn't
think that you would come.

15
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:02,304
I wasn't going to,
but...

16
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:03,705
I'm glad you did.

17
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:06,809
So am I.

18
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:12,515
Do you hear that?

19
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:14,383
What?

20
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:18,521
The thumping noise?
Is -- is that you?

21
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:20,222
You can hear that?

22
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:22,358
Gary!

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,560
Ohh!
Gary!

24
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,830
Gary, what is it?!
What --

25
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:29,915
Ohh!

26
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:32,067
Gary! Gary!

27

29
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,311
Right, yeah.

30
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:49,014
No, just, uh -- just call us
whenever you find something.

31
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:50,349
Yeah.

32
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:53,185
Yeah, course.

33
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:54,653
Right. No, I-I, uh...

34
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:57,656
Yeah, hey, you know what?
Uh, Dean's here.

35
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:00,909
He really wants to talk
to you.

36
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:03,412
Ms. Tran,
yeah, hi, uh...

37
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,564
Tunnel.

38
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,533
What's going on
in Tran-land?

39
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:10,569
Well, uh, Garth finally got them
to his houseboat,

40
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:11,920
but Kevin's having
a lot of trouble

41
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:13,238
reading their half
of the tablet.

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,241
So far, bits and pieces.
Nothing about boarding up hell.

43
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:18,927
Garth has a safe-houseboat?

44
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:21,079
Dude, I don't even
ask questions anymore.

45
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,251
What's the word, Cass?

46
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:28,971
It's a shortened version
of my name.

47
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:31,440
Yes, it is.

48
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,941
I meant what's the word
on the Word?

49
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:35,260
Any, uh, tablet chatter
on angel radio?

50
00:02:35,262 --> 00:02:38,297
Oh, I couldn't say.
I turned that off.

51
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:40,115
You can do that?
Yeah, it's a simple matter

52
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,100
of blocking out
certain subsonic frequencies.

53
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:43,902
I could draw you a diagram
if you want.

54
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:47,272
No, that's -- we're good.
Why'd you flip the switch?

55
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:50,492
Because it's a direct link
to heaven.

56
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:53,445
And I don't want anything to do
with that place --

57
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:54,797
not anymore.

58
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,416
So what now?

59
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:59,885
Move to Vermont,
open up a charming B&B?

60
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:01,754
No.

61
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:05,624
I still want --
I still <i>need</i> to help people.

62
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:08,944
So...I'm gonna become
a hunter.

63
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:15,300
Really?

64
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:17,603
Yeah. I could be
your third wheel.

65
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:20,889
You know
that's not a good thing, right?

66
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,925
Of course it is. A third wheel
adds extra grip, greater stability.

67
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:24,693
I even found a case.

68
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:28,197
Oklahoma City -- a man's heart
jumped 10 feet out of his chest.

69
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,799
It sounds like
our kind of thing, right?

70
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:33,410
He's got a point.
Excellent.

71
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:34,668
I'll see you there.

72
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:36,001
Wait, Cass, Cass.

73
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:38,528
If you want to play cowboys
and bloodsuckers, that's fine.

74
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:40,478
But you're gonna stick with us,
okay?

75
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,681
None of this zapping around
crap. Capiche?

76
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:45,016
Yeah, I capiche.

77
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:47,402
All right, then.

78
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,113
Can I, uh, at least ride
in the front seat?

79
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,698
No. No.

80
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:02,450
Coroner said his heart
was ejected from his body.

81
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:05,370
Got some air, too.
Found it in a sandbox.

82
00:04:05,372 --> 00:04:07,339
Any idea what happened,
Detective?

83
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:10,091
A lot of people are thinking
drugs, Agent Nash --

84
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:12,093
an assload of drugs.

85
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:13,178
There are no narcotics
in that man's system.

86
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,046
His molecules
are all wrong.

87
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:18,333
But you don't think that,
huh?

88
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:20,218
Never seen an eightball
do <i>that.</i>

89
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:24,839
Wow.
And who called this in?

90
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:26,057
Friend of his named
Olivia Kopple.

91
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,309
She saw the whole thing.

92
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,694
Oh.

93
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:32,330
Ah, crap.
I have -- I have to take this.

94
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:33,735
Here's everything we got.
Knock yourself out.

95
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:35,868
- Thanks.
- Listen, you see anything weird,

96
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:38,186
anything out of the box,
you just call me.

97
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:42,040
Whatever you say, Scully.

98
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,959
Detective Glass.

99
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,043
On my way.

100
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:49,197
I can't sense
any EMF or sulfur.

101
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,252
Mr. Frieling's arterial health
is, uh, excellent.

102
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:56,471
Mm.

103
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:58,139
He did recently suffer
from a...

104
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:59,374
...mild, uh...

105
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:00,875
What is that?

106
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:03,345
...bladder infection.

107
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:04,646
Cass, stop smelling
the dead guy.

108
00:05:04,648 --> 00:05:08,266
Why? Now I know everything
about this man. So we can --

109
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:09,935
Do you know
he was having an affair?

110
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:11,937
What?

111
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:13,989
Strike one, Sherlock.

112
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:15,390
According to Olivia,

113
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:17,892
they would meet at the park
every Thursday at 12:45,

114
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:19,110
walk to the Moonlight diner,

115
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:21,079
where she always ordered
a caesar salad,

116
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:22,364
dressing on the side.

117
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:23,465
They would chat
about everything,

118
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:26,167
and she'd be back on the road
by 1:30.

119
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,070
You don't think
she's telling the truth.

120
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:31,589
Too much detail.
Sounds rehearsed.

121
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:34,242
Plus, we drove past
the Moonlight diner

122
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:35,627
on the way into town.

123
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:37,796
It's attached
to the Moonlight motel.

124
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:42,100
Okay, well, let's say that, uh,
Gary here's on the prowl,

125
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:44,252
but he's playing it safe
because...

126
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:47,605
...dude's married.

127
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:49,691
Doesn't want anyone
to see his ride

128
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:52,143
parked out in front
of a by-the-hour fleabag.

129
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:54,562
So he stashes his car
at the park across the street,

130
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:55,563
meets Olivia there.

131
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:56,865
His wife
probably found out about it,

132
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:58,650
and it broke her heart.
So she breaks his.

133
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:00,201
Sounds witchy.

134
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:01,602
Yes, it does.

135
00:06:01,604 --> 00:06:03,288
Guy was living a lie,

136
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,623
and it came back
to bite him in the ticker.

137
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,009
But nice job
on the bladder infection.

138
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,769
He said
he'd be here by 5:00.

139
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:38,139
Uh, just deep breath.

140
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:40,492
It's gonna be okay.
I know.

141
00:06:40,494 --> 00:06:42,410
It's just this house,
you --

142
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:45,447
he's gonna think
we're moving too fast.

143
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,166
Are we moving too fast?

144
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:52,653
We're making up
for lost time.

145
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:00,712
Don't talk politics.

146
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:03,164
Don't say anything bad
about the Cowboys.

147
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,599
And whatever you do,
don't --

148
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:07,252
do not use the words "moist"
or "irregardless."

149
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,021
There goes my opener.

150
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,026
Hi, Dad!

151
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:16,177
Ohh, munchkin!

152
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:18,646
Okay, embarrassing.

153
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:23,785
That is my job, kiddo.
So, who's this handsome fella?

154
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:27,872
Yeah, he's a good boy!

155
00:07:27,874 --> 00:07:30,024
How you doing there?
You're beautiful.

156
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:32,860
That good boy belongs
to this good boy.

157
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:37,132
Stan Thompson,
this is Sam Winchester.

158
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:38,800
Hi.
I heard a lot about you.

159
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:40,218
Not all bad, I hope.

160
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:45,890
So, this is a nice place.
Lawn could use a mow.

161
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:48,476
Sam found it.

162
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:49,710
I've been so busy lately.

163
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:52,247
He's had to move us in
by himself, pretty much.

164
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:56,267
Huh.
Job almost well done.

165
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:00,188
Do you want a drink, Dad?
We have beer, iced tea --

166
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,323
Anything cold will be fantastic.
Thank you, sweetheart.

167
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:04,392
Okay.

168
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:10,898
Mr. Thompson, um, I just --
I know this must be weird.

169
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,400
Uh, you haven't seen Amelia
in months,

170
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:14,836
and now she's living with a guy
you've never met.

171
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:16,204
Ame said
you went to Stanford.

172
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,639
I did.

173
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:19,190
It's a good school.
It is.

174
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:21,092
So what do you do now?

175
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:23,011
I work at a motel
in town.

176
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:26,331
Ah. Balancing the books?

177
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:30,185
Uh, no.
Maintenance mostly.

178
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:32,704
Ah.

179
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:34,189
Well, that makes sense.

180
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:35,940
'Cause I got to say, Sam,

181
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:38,643
you look like
a real fixer-upper to me.

182
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,533
I-I don't understand.

183
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:47,202
Gary had a heart attack.

184
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:48,153
Why would the FBI --

185
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:49,704
The parks
are government property.

186
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:51,372
We just got a few questions
for you.

187
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:55,160
I'll, uh...
I'll handle this.

188
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:57,879
I've done research.
I can crack her.

189
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:00,665
Now, Ms. Frieling,

190
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:03,618
I don't want to bother you.
I-I really don't.

191
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,489
But I-I do have
just one question for you.

192
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:09,507
Why did you kill
your husband?!

193
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:11,926
Agent Stills.
A word, please.

194
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:15,563
What?
I was being bad cop.

195
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:17,465
No, you were being
bad everything.

196
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:18,650
Please,
forgive my partner.

197
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:21,436
He's, uh -- he's going
through some stuff.

198
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:22,604
Listen to Sam.

199
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,355
What he was trying to ask --
is -- is there any way

200
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:29,327
Gary might have had secrets --
something he was hiding?

201
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:31,896
Hiding? Like what?

202
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,452
Deb?

203
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:41,372
Olivia.
Hey.

204
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:42,674
Are you okay?

205
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:44,342
As in mistress Olivia?

206
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:45,843
This is awkward.

207
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,381
I'm sorry. W-what did you think
Gary was hiding?

208
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:53,101
That he was sleeping
with her.

209
00:09:57,057 --> 00:09:58,339
I know.

210
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,026
You know?

211
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:06,864
Gary and I -- we...

212
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,299
had an arrangement.

213
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:10,351
He was seeing Olivia,

214
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:14,138
and I was spending some time
with our neighbor P.J.

215
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,042
I'll, uh -- I'll put this in the kitchen.
I'll help.

216
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:20,545
Yeah.
Okay.

217
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:22,247
Frigging suburbs, man.

218
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:23,581
So she's not a witch.

219
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,583
Just the best wife ever.

220
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,254
Then what killed her husband?
Who gives a...

221
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,063
It's a miracle!

222
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,334
God wants me to live!

223
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,826
Looks like suicide.

224
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,661
It was.
Guy left a note.

225
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:22,413
He invested everything
in Roman Industries

226
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,614
and lost it all when they
crashed and burned last year.

227
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:26,250
So why call us?

228
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,918
Because I have two witnesses
who swear

229
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,088
that Madoff here floated
in midair for a good 10 seconds,

230
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,590
then he looked down,
and splat.

231
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,143
Not sure I buy that,
but the way they're talking,

232
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,297
it sounds like something
straight out of a --

233
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:38,216
Cartoon.

234
00:11:38,217 --> 00:11:38,871
Hey, Detective.

235
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:41,889
You said you wanted weird.
Thanks.

236
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:44,835
Yeah, what do you got?
She's right, you know.

237
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,321
I mean, the whole heart jumping
out of the guy's chest,

238
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,822
the -- the --
the delayed fall --

239
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:50,474
that's
straight-up Bugs Bunny.

240
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,810
So we're looking for some sort
of insect-rabbit hybrid?

241
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,362
How do we kill it?

242
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:56,613
No, we don't, Cass.

243
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,165
That's a character,
like, uh --

244
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,816
like Woody Woodpecker
or Daffy Duck.

245
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:01,335
They're
little animated movies.

246
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:04,154
You know, uh, the coyote chases
a roadrunner,

247
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,323
and then the -- the anvil
gets dropped on his head.

248
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,959
Is it
supposed to be funny?

249
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,544
No.

250
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,430
It's hilarious.

251
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:16,166
<i>Stay tuned, kids!</i>
<i>We'll be right back!</i>

252
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,470
I understand.

253
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,355
The bird represents God.

254
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:25,275
And coyote is man,
endlessly chasing the divine,

255
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,411
yet never able to catch him.
It's...

256
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:30,197
It's hilarious.

257
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,351
I got no idea
what we're hunting.

258
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,536
Maybe it's a Tulpa.

259
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,121
Maybe it's some --
some crazy God

260
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,455
who watched too much
"Robot Chicken."

261
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,240
I-I -- I mean,
is there a link

262
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:42,910
between "Heartbreak Hotel"
and "Free Fallin'"?

263
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,661
Not that I can find.

264
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,696
All right, well,
I'm gonna call it.

265
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,799
Cass, you gonna book a room
or what?

266
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,217
No, I'll stay here.

267
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:52,052
Oh, okay. Yeah.

268
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,087
We'll have a slumber party
and braid Sam's hair.

269
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:57,374
- Where are you gonna sleep?
- I don't sleep.

270
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,726
Okay, well, I need
my four hours, so...

271
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:01,145
I'll watch over you.

272
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,430
That's not gonna happen.

273
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:07,050
Something's coming across
the police band.

274
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,402
Wait, you can hear that?

275
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:09,820
It's all waves.

276
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:15,242
A bank has been robbed.
It sounds loony.

277
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:17,194
Define "loony."

278
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,282
That's loony, all right.

279
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:26,069
Agents. I was just about
to give you a ring.

280
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,122
Got to ask --
do you boys chase the crazy,

281
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:30,574
or does the crazy chase you?

282
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,259
Depends on the day.

283
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:33,410
Who's the pancake?
Security guard.

284
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,128
He called in
reporting a robbery,

285
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,881
but by the time we got here --
A robbery?

286
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,915
Looks like the black hole

287
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:40,717
was trying to jimmy open
a safe-deposit box

288
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,936
when Mr. Rent-A-Cop
found him.

289
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:44,655
And, well,
you know how <i>that</i> story ends.

290
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,823
Black hole?

291
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,092
It's our name for a burglar
that's been running us ragged.

292
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,311
He's a pro --
no fingerprints,

293
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:52,980
never any sign
of forced entry --

294
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:57,234
just a pair of those every time,
like he's signing his work.

295
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:02,489
Perp's never done anything like
this before, though...obviously.

296
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:03,707
You mind if I take a look
at your files

297
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,708
on those other break-ins?

298
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,943
No skin off my nose.

299
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,295
I'm headed to the station now
if you want a ride.

300
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:10,163
Perfect.

301
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:16,670
Hey.
Can you lift this?

302
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:36,356
"X" marks the spot.

303
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:38,975
Well, whoever's doing this is
playing by cartoon rules.

304
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:41,411
- Animation doesn't have rules.
- Sure it does.

305
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,363
In Toontown, a pretty girl

306
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:44,915
can make your heart
leap out of your chest,

307
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,667
anvils fall from the sky,

308
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:49,986
and if you draw a door
or a black hole on the wall,

309
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:52,205
you can stroll
right through it.

310
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:54,675
So this is
how the thief got in.

311
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:59,096
And out.
And cracked the vault.

312
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,266
Then why isn't it working
now?

313
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:06,486
I got no clue.

314
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,109
Your father...

315
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,728
Beautiful handwriting.

316
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,897
How you feeling, Cass?

317
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:19,566
I'm fine.

318
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:23,854
Well, I just --
I-I know that when...

319
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,722
I got puked
out of Purgatory,

320
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,759
it took me a few weeks to...
Find my sea legs.

321
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,561
I'm fine.

322
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,915
Don't get me wrong.
I'm happy you're back.

323
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:36,667
I'm freaking thrilled.

324
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:40,921
It's just this whole
mysterious-resurrection thing --

325
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:42,872
it always has
one mother of a downside.

326
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:47,043
So, what do you want me
to do?

327
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:48,259
Maybe take a trip
upstairs.

328
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,426
To heaven?

329
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:50,627
Yeah, poke around,

330
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:52,095
see if the God squad
can't tell us how you got out.

331
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:53,513
No.

332
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,868
Look, man, I-I hate
those flying-ass monkeys

333
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,137
just as much as you do,
but --

334
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:01,688
Dean! I said no!

335
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,171
Talk to me.

336
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:21,191
Dean, I...

337
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:31,001
When I was...bad...and I had
all those things --

338
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:36,206
the...the leviathans...
writhing inside me...

339
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:40,710
I caused a lot of suffering
on Earth,

340
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:43,413
but I devastated heaven.

341
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:46,350
I vaporized
thousands of my own kind,

342
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:49,569
and I-I-I can't go back.

343
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:52,356
'Cause if you do,
the angels will kill you.

344
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:57,044
Because if I see what heaven's
become -- what I...

345
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:04,785
...what I made of it...
I'm afraid I might kill myself.

346
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:09,923
Hey.
Got something.

347
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:13,293
Good.
Excellent. What?

348
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:15,762
So this black-hole guy --
before he tried the bank,

349
00:17:15,764 --> 00:17:17,714
he robbed a house
across from the park

350
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:19,182
where Gary blew a gasket.

351
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:22,636
So, uh, you think
the house heist

352
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:24,588
and Gary's corpse
are connected?

353
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,010
According to the file,
they happened at pretty

354
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:27,775
much the exact same time.

355
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:29,426
Here.
Check this out. Okay.

356
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:35,032
Here's the house, and Gary died
across the street here.

357
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:36,733
And that building from
this morning -- right there.

358
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:38,935
The black hole hit that, too.
Let me guess --

359
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:40,120
where, uh, what's his name
took a swan dive.

360
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:43,323
All right. I'll bite.
What about the others?

361
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:45,942
Well, those are the places
that stuff got stolen.

362
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:47,044
But nobody got dead.

363
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:48,829
Take away the graffiti,

364
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:52,916
and these all look like
just normal smash-and-grabs.

365
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:54,951
But I made a few phone calls,
talked to some people

366
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:57,671
who are nearby --
neighbors and whatnot --

367
00:17:57,673 --> 00:17:59,339
and they reported
a whole lot of crazy.

368
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:00,474
Like?

369
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:02,225
Like a jogger
bumping his head

370
00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:03,643
and sprouting a four-inch lump

371
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:06,646
or a kid walking into a wall
and hearing birdies.

372
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:09,015
Basically, for 50 yards
around each robbery,

373
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:10,434
people were living
in a cartoon.

374
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:11,401
But it didn't last long --

375
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:13,353
I mean, 5, 10 minutes
at each place.

376
00:18:13,355 --> 00:18:14,354
About the length of time

377
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:15,822
it would take a thief
to get in and out.

378
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:17,190
Exactly.

379
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:19,776
But whatever power he's using,
it's -- it's not targeted.

380
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:22,829
I mean, it's -- it's
kind of like an area of effect.

381
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:25,749
I mean, picture him
in a bubble of weird,

382
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:30,170
and anything that touches it
gets daffy.

383
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:32,756
So this animaniac
can step through walls,

384
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:33,823
can toss an anvil?

385
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:35,592
Yeah, but he's warping reality
to do it.

386
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:37,160
So if someone
happens to be nearby

387
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:38,678
meeting the girl
of his dreams...

388
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,046
His heart
makes a break for it.

389
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:42,999
Okay, so smashing the, uh --
the rent-a-cop --

390
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:45,185
that -- that was on purpose,
but the rest of them --

391
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:48,338
what, is that just collateral weird?
Maybe.

392
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,606
So we're looking
for a thief.

393
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:51,141
And the deposit box he was
after.

394
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:55,395
Now, the house, the office --
every place he's hit

395
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:56,546
belonged to someone

396
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:57,531
living at the Sunset Fields
retirement home.

397
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,516
So you think
our guy's there.

398
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:01,535
Worth a shot.

399
00:19:01,537 --> 00:19:04,488
All right. Well, let's gear up.
It's wabbit season.

400
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:08,058
I don't think
you pronounced that correctly.

401
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,869
Come on. It's not that bad.
You can't tell me this joint

402
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:22,872
doesn't give you the heebs
and/or jeebs.

403
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:25,926
Hello. Can I help you?
Hi.

404
00:19:25,928 --> 00:19:27,344
Yeah.
Agent Crosby. FBI.

405
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:30,013
Sorry,
I'm Dr. Dwight Mahoney.

406
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:31,881
I run Sunset Fields.

407
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:34,317
We need to question
your residents.

408
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,736
Well...why?
About what?

409
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:39,556
Grand larceny,
mostly.

410
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:43,777
Of course.
Um, by all means, ask away.

411
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:45,228
If there's anything I can do
to help, let me know.

412
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,831
Appreciate it.
Great.

413
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,751
All right, let's do this.
No flirting, you two.

414
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:56,906
You are so pretty,
Charles.

415
00:20:00,928 --> 00:20:02,629
That's not my name.

416
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:07,517
Oh! You look
so much like my third husband.

417
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,022
We're here to talk
about the robbery, ma'am.

418
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:13,356
Robbery?
Mm-hmm.

419
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:15,692
The one the police talked to you
about a few days ago.

420
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:17,811
Someone broke
into your old house

421
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,963
and stole
a stack of bearer bonds

422
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:21,198
and, uh, some jewelry

423
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,899
that you stashed
under your floorboards.

424
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:26,536
Oh, my diamonds, yes.
I hid them there.

425
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:28,321
I'm sorry, Charles.

426
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:30,156
I didn't trust you.

427
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:32,459
You were quite
the bounder.

428
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:36,796
Did you tell anyone where
your valuables were, Mrs. Tate?

429
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:39,099
I don't think so.

430
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:41,167
But then I get a little fuzzy
sometimes.

431
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:44,054
Have you noticed
anything strange lately --

432
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,306
uh, cold spots, smells?

433
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:50,293
Well, there's the cat.

434
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:52,145
The cat?

435
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:55,098
He talks sometimes.

436
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,150
Really hates that mouse.

437
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:00,604
I'll interrogate the cat.

438
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:07,310
You all done here?

439
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:08,828
All right.

440
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,169
It's creepy, right?

441
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:17,837
A lot of these people --

442
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,624
they just tune out
and live in their own heads.

443
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:23,643
It's like maybe the real world
is too much for them,

444
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:25,595
and they just run and hide,
you know?

445
00:21:25,597 --> 00:21:27,797
Hmm.

446
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:34,671
Soup's on...
and semi-edible.

447
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:38,191
You remembered.

448
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:42,495
Dad was in the army, so we moved
around a lot when I was a kid.

449
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:44,781
Having spaghetti and hot dogs
our first night in a new house

450
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:46,733
was sort of a tradition.
All right. Got it.

451
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:49,736
Uh, my father was
in the Marines.

452
00:21:49,738 --> 00:21:51,037
Jarhead, huh?

453
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,658
That's right. Uh, 2nd battalion,
First Marines, Echo company.

454
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,661
I always thought they were
a little puffed up, myself.

455
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,031
But, hey.
What do I know?

456
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:04,417
I'm just an old grunt.

457
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:05,969
You're my old grunt.

458
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,060
So, Ame tells me
you never served.

459
00:22:14,062 --> 00:22:15,895
No.

460
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:17,380
See, I find that
hard to believe

461
00:22:17,382 --> 00:22:20,817
'cause I got to say, Sam,
you got the look.

462
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:23,603
The look?

463
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:26,072
The one a lot of guys get after
they've been through the meat grinder --

464
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:28,358
the one that let's you know
they've seen

465
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,193
a lot of crap
they can't forget.

466
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:32,562
The second
their feet hit solid ground,

467
00:22:32,564 --> 00:22:34,914
they start running,
and they don't stop --

468
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,617
not till they find something
to hold on to.

469
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:39,068
You think
that's what I'm doing here?

470
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:41,571
Just holding on?

471
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:47,910
I think the two of you are
holding on to each other, yeah.

472
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:50,930
'Cause I know she's scared.

473
00:22:50,932 --> 00:22:54,768
After what happened to Don, I
don't blame her for taking off.

474
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,138
Needing to run away and hide --
I know why she did it.

475
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,126
The question is --
what are <i>you</i> running from, Sam?

476
00:23:07,615 --> 00:23:09,932
Hey, what do you got?

477
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:14,621
Hey, um, nothing.
Uh, no hex bags, no EMF. You?

478
00:23:14,623 --> 00:23:16,289
Nada.

479
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:19,075
Half the folks I talked to don't
even remember being robbed.

480
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,414
Dean, um...

481
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:27,967
You remember a guy
named Fred Jones?

482
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:29,586
I think he was
a contact of dad's,

483
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:30,301
lived outside of Salt Lake.

484
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,639
Yeah, that guy gave me
my first beer.

485
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,223
I don't even think
I was double digits.

486
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:36,342
Right, yeah. Me, too.
Um, he was psychic, right?

487
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:38,395
Psychokinetic. Why?

488
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:42,932
'Cause he's in room 114.

489
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:47,320
Cass. Let's go.

490
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,072
I've almost cracked him.

491
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:50,607
Now.

492
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,277
Hey.
I'm not through with you.

493
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:59,982
Dumbass.

494
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:08,842
Mr. Jones?

495
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:13,713
Hey, it's, uh,
Sam Winchester.

496
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,466
Fred?

497
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:21,003
<i>My nerves!</i>
<i>Get me a doctor!</i>

498
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:23,740
Fred! Hey!

499
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:27,009
So,
you really think this one man

500
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:30,363
is causing all of these...
Shenanigans?

501
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:31,514
Well, if he is,

502
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:33,867
he'd be surrounded
by a circle of crazy, right?

503
00:24:35,786 --> 00:24:39,656
Hang on.

504
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:50,633
Bingo.

505
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:53,636
But how?

506
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:55,004
Fred's got juice.

507
00:24:55,006 --> 00:24:56,639
I mean, an average psychokinetic
can move things with his mind,

508
00:24:56,641 --> 00:24:59,142
but a guy like Fred --
you get him worked up,

509
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:00,677
he can reshape reality.

510
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,979
All right, so where's his "off" switch?
I don't know.

511
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:04,647
I'm not even certain
if he knows we're here.

512
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:07,567
Do we...kill him?

513
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:10,320
Excuse me, Agents.

514
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:12,522
Did he just threaten to murder
one of my patients?

515
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:16,910
Real freaking smooth.

516
00:25:16,912 --> 00:25:18,778
Well, we don't have to
leave him.

517
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,413
I could teleport him.

518
00:25:20,415 --> 00:25:21,915
Fred's radioactive,
Cass.

519
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,232
Zap him -- no telling
what will happen.

520
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:24,534
Me and Sam
will circle back tonight,

521
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:26,119
get Fred nice and clean.

522
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:28,338
You go invisible girl and keep
an eye on him. You hear me?

523
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:35,578
Good.

524
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:48,942
Happy Birthday, Sheila.

525
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,171
Ha. Good.

526
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:08,161
Get ready. Big breath.

527
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:10,380
Oh, ready.

528
00:26:25,802 --> 00:26:28,470
I'm just gonna wipe this off
your face, okay?

529
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:31,556
I'm just gonna
put this on.

530
00:26:35,144 --> 00:26:38,346
Oh.
You got my message. Good.

531
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,631
What the hell happened?

532
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,183
There was
a pastry mishap.

533
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,685
Okay, and?

534
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,136
And the frosting reached
near-supersonic speeds.

535
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:46,738
I thought --

536
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,406
Hey. Fred's gone.
Hey.

537
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:49,574
What?
Oh, fan-freaking-tastic.

538
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:51,159
Way to take your eye
off the ball.

539
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:53,194
You're
not supposed to be here.

540
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,646
Well, trust me, sweetheart,
you got bigger fish.

541
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,082
Charles,
she's wearing my diamonds.

542
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:58,649
Wait.

543
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,835
What? What's wrong?

544
00:27:00,837 --> 00:27:02,837
This is
Mrs. Tate's bracelet.

545
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,457
Where did you get it?

546
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,375
Answer the question.

547
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,010
My boyfriend
gave it to me.

548
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:25,927
Hey. Bearer bonds.

549
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:27,862
Maybe these belonged
to Sheila Tate.

550
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:29,898
So this man is our thief.

551
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,200
Yeah. Dean.

552
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,217
Cass.

553
00:27:53,055 --> 00:27:54,923
Stay still.

554
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:57,008
Move your hands.

555
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,528
How did you...

556
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,530
Guy eats his Wheaties.
Sam, come on. What did you...

557
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:19,697
Get up.
Come on. Sit down.

558
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,116
Wait a second!
What did you just do to me?!

559
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:23,618
Hey, hey, hey! Listen to me.
Where is Fred Jones?

560
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,620
I -- he -- he took him.

561
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:26,754
Who?!

562
00:28:26,756 --> 00:28:29,574
Dr. Mahoney.
That guy's evil, man, okay?

563
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:32,877
- He's using Mr. Jones.
- How?

564
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,246
Look, all Fred does is watch
cartoons, but he is magic, okay?

565
00:28:35,248 --> 00:28:37,132
A few weeks ago,
I-I slammed my foot in his door.

566
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:38,766
I smashed it flat --
and I mean flat.

567
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:40,418
And then when I shook the thing,
it popped back up,

568
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,684
like something out of a cartoon
or whatever.

569
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:43,222
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know.

570
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:46,774
So I told Dr. Mahoney, and then
he started doing experiments.

571
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:48,643
Just -- we just wanted to see
what he could do.

572
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,094
What about the robberies?

573
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,746
Oh, Mahoney's been skimming off
Sunset Fields for years.

574
00:28:51,748 --> 00:28:53,948
A lot of those folks --
they got stuff stashed away,

575
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,949
like, off the books.

576
00:28:54,951 --> 00:28:57,101
So Mahoney would track down
the loot,

577
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,703
and then we would take Fred
for a drive.

578
00:28:58,705 --> 00:29:00,905
Right, and use his bubble
of weird to rip people off.

579
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,273
How did you end up
gut-shot?

580
00:29:02,275 --> 00:29:04,242
Mahoney -- after --
after he anviled that guard,

581
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,044
he started freaking out,
and then you showed up,

582
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:08,946
and then the cake blew in
the day room, and then he lost it.

583
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,965
What does that mean,
"he lost it"?

584
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:12,834
I mean he's on his way
back to the bank right now

585
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,502
for one last score.

586
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:15,637
Doc's blowing town.

587
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:16,971
I mean, he said
that Fred was a loose end.

588
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:18,139
He was gonna kill him.

589
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:20,058
And then I like Fred,

590
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,643
so I said that if he hurt
the guy, I'd go to the cops.

591
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:23,728
And I didn't know
that he had a gun.

592
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,180
Okay.

593
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:31,269
Do you think Mr. Jones knows
what's happening?

594
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:32,520
I don't know.

595
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:35,607
Seems to me like the dude's
living in a dream world.

596
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,335
Look, I am trying to help.

597
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:50,321
Boy, I'll tell you,
if don could see you...

598
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:54,425
Don't. Just don't.

599
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:58,096
You can't --
you need to come home.

600
00:29:58,098 --> 00:29:59,997
Is that why you're here --
to drag me back?

601
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:01,165
This is my life.

602
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,134
This -- it won't last.

603
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,136
You are living
in a dream world.

604
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,438
I like it here.
I like this house.

605
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,623
I like Sam.

606
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,191
Sam is a mess.

607
00:30:10,193 --> 00:30:11,842
<i>I'm</i> a mess.

608
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:16,531
But when I'm with Sam,
I'm happy, Dad.

609
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:18,783
And I haven't been happy
in a really long time.

610
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:24,689
So please, just...
let us be messes together.

611
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:27,242
Give us a chance.

612
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,197
I'll dry.

613
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:55,386
Is that your car outside --
the Impala?

614
00:30:55,388 --> 00:30:57,855
Yeah, it was my dad's.

615
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:59,991
Guy had good taste...

616
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:02,827
...for a jarhead.

617
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:20,378
All right.
Jones has got to be close.

618
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,048
I'll hit the bank.
You see if you can find him.

619
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,459
Awesome.

620
00:31:55,547 --> 00:32:00,168
Can you feel that, Sam?

621
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,553
The power.

622
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,259
Calamity Jane for you!

623
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:11,562
Fred, hey.
Fred, hey, buddy.

624
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:13,765
Hey. Hey, Fred?
Listen to me.

625
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,933
Can you hear me?
Fred!

626
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,652
If we could just talk
to him.

627
00:32:17,654 --> 00:32:18,653
Hey, buddy.

628
00:32:18,655 --> 00:32:21,356
Hey, wake up.
Wake up.

629
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,440
Cass?

630
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:25,843
Wait. Wait!

631
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:34,520
Aha!

632
00:32:40,545 --> 00:32:42,963
Cass, uh,
where are we?

633
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:44,497
Inside
Mr. Jones' mind.

634
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:47,867
You said
you wanted to talk to him.

635
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:50,703
Who the hell are you?

636
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:56,209
Fred. Fred. Um, hey, it's --
it's -- it's me.

637
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:59,896
I'm, uh -- I'm Sam --
Sam Winchester.

638
00:32:59,898 --> 00:33:02,548
John's boy?

639
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,716
That's right.

640
00:33:03,718 --> 00:33:04,901
The scrawny one?

641
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:10,023
It's only been three,
four years since I've seen you.

642
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:11,241
You --
more like, uh, 20.

643
00:33:11,243 --> 00:33:16,562
Uh, listen, Fred,
I'm gonna need you to focus.

644
00:33:16,564 --> 00:33:18,415
How did you...

645
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:23,169
Why are you here, Sam?

646
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:31,044
What's up, Doc?

647
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:35,932
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You're lying!

648
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:39,436
This is happening, Mr. Jones.
They're using you.

649
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:41,972
As what -- some kind
of a damn psychic coppertop?

650
00:33:41,974 --> 00:33:44,924
You plug me in, and the whole
world goes wacky?

651
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:46,693
It doesn't work that way.
How would you know?

652
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:48,862
No offense,
but it seems to me

653
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:51,147
like you've been spending
more time in here

654
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:55,618
than you have...
Out there.

655
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,823
You want to know what's
the worst thing that can happen

656
00:33:59,825 --> 00:34:03,043
to a guy who's got a mind
like I got?

657
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:06,212
Losing it.

658
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,135
You let me walk,
and half of this is yours.

659
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:15,922
I think I'm gonna pass.

660
00:34:15,924 --> 00:34:18,124
I'm not really into stealing
from sweet old ladies.

661
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:19,142
I'm not stealing
from them.

662
00:34:19,144 --> 00:34:20,577
I'm stealing
from their children.

663
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:23,430
Little bastards think they can
drop their folks off at a home

664
00:34:23,432 --> 00:34:25,732
and visit twice a year,
maybe.

665
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:28,268
I took care
of all these old geezers.

666
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,070
I think I deserve--
I don't care!

667
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:31,821
Fine.

668
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:34,274
Have it your way.

669
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:42,582
Welcome to the fun house.

670
00:34:44,368 --> 00:34:46,536
Cartoons -- yeah, yeah, I always
loved them when I was a kid.

671
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:50,540
They made me feel...
Happy -- safe.

672
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:51,841
They were...

673
00:34:51,843 --> 00:34:53,993
Something
to hold on to.

674
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:56,212
Yeah.

675
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,953
Give up?

676
00:35:19,955 --> 00:35:21,521
I've been dealing
with this crazy for months!

677
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:25,125
And you -- idiot --
bring a gun to a gag fight.

678
00:35:25,127 --> 00:35:28,194
Yeah, well,
I did bring this.

679
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:30,163
And "X" marks the spot.

680
00:35:36,088 --> 00:35:39,255
I need you to stop this --
take control.

681
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:41,474
It's too hard!

682
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:43,593
Look, it can be nice living
in a dream world.

683
00:35:43,595 --> 00:35:45,395
It can be great.
I know that.

684
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:46,679
And you can hide,

685
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:48,948
and you can pretend all the crap
out there doesn't exist,

686
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:52,552
but you can't do it forever
because...eventually,

687
00:35:52,554 --> 00:35:56,406
whatever it is you're running
from -- it'll find you.

688
00:35:56,408 --> 00:35:58,508
It'll come along, and it'll
punch you in the gut.

689
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:01,027
And then...

690
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:05,782
Then you got to wake up,
because if you don't,

691
00:36:05,784 --> 00:36:09,586
then trying to keep that dream
alive will destroy you!

692
00:36:09,588 --> 00:36:13,039
It'll destroy everything!

693
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:33,476
Looks like somebody turned off
the boob tube.

694
00:36:33,478 --> 00:36:37,030
- Good.
- Means I can use this.

695
00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:43,736
No! You are never
going to hurt anyone again!

696
00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:59,702
That's all, folks.

697
00:37:10,454 --> 00:37:13,006
My God.

698
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,836
Fred. You good?

699
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:22,321
<i>Now</i> I'm good.

700
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,774
In a month, year...

701
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:29,311
Nobody gets sharper
with age.

702
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:33,065
I'm gonna lose control
again,

703
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:38,537
and somebody's gonna
get hurt...again.

704
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:42,541
You got to make it stop.

705
00:37:42,543 --> 00:37:45,861
There might be a way.

706
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,916
The procedure will be painful,
and...when it's over,

707
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:54,470
I'm not sure how much of <i>you</i>
will be left.

708
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:06,982
Well,
what are you waiting for?

709
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:14,556
Is he, uh --
is he okay?

710
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,643
He's listening
to "Ode to Joy."

711
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:22,248
He's happy.

712
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,869
All right, well,
let's blow this termite terrace.

713
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,921
Cass, you get to ride shotgun.
You done good.

714
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:30,572
Thanks, but I, uh...

715
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:33,793
I can't come. I, uh...

716
00:38:37,747 --> 00:38:39,932
Hello, Castiel.

717
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:41,634
And, no.

718
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:43,185
No?

719
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:46,138
I can see what you're thinking,
and I won't allow it.

720
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,523
You don't understand.

721
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,758
I have been trying
to pretend

722
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,429
that I can escape what I did
in heaven, but I can't.

723
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:56,532
All that pain
that I caused --

724
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,285
I-I have to come back,
to make things right.

725
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:02,238
And you are...
by doing what you're told.

726
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,157
Bottom line --
unless I ring my bell,

727
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:08,043
you stay out of heaven,
Castiel.

728
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:11,030
Well, then,
what should I do?

729
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:13,799
What do
you want to do?

730
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:21,290
You -- you what, Cass?
W-why can't you come with us?

731
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:24,927
I, um...

732
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:28,414
I want to stay
with Mr. Jones.

733
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:33,185
Someone should watch over him
for a few days just to be safe.

734
00:39:33,187 --> 00:39:34,436
Okay, and then what?

735
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,721
Then I'm not sure.

736
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:40,659
But I know
I can't run anymore.

737
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:45,480
So, Ame is playing
the Sugarplum fairy, right?

738
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:46,648
Right?

739
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,417
Now, this is her big moment,
you understand,

740
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,786
and she waddles up onto the stage --
Waddles?

741
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,122
What? You were a chubby kid.
It was adorable.

742
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,490
Anyway, she waddles up
onto the stage,

743
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:59,595
and she is dragging two feet
of toilet paper behind her.

744
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,547
No.

745
00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:04,049
You remember that?

746
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:05,551
Yeah.

747
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:08,687
Officially the end
of her career.

748
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:11,440
You want one of these?
Please, yeah.

749
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:14,860
Thanks.

750
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:22,234
My, uh --
my brother used to do that.

751
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:23,518
Yeah?
Yeah.

752
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,354
He a good guy?
Yeah.

753
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:29,208
Yeah, uh, he --
he was...the best.

754
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:36,515
Uh, I, uh...
I lost him, and, uh, I-I ran.

755
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,717
I'm sorry
to hear about that.

756
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:43,322
What?

757
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:46,541
A-are you sure?

758
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:48,644
Oh, God.

759
00:40:58,788 --> 00:41:01,774
Amelia?

760
00:41:01,776 --> 00:41:05,661
Baby? You okay?

761
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,697
It's Don.

762
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,401
He's alive.

763
00:41:19,092 --> 00:41:20,843
Sam, you with me?

764
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:33,759
