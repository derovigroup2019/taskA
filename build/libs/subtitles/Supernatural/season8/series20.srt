00:00:02,792 --> 00:00:04,443
"Supernatural" by Carver Edlund.

2
00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:06,629
Everything is in here --
I mean, everything,

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,964
from the racist truck
to me having sex.

4
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:11,133
<i>Moondoor.</i>
Wait, is that --

5
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:14,453
<i>Defend the Queen of Moons.</i>

6
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:16,088
I love you.
I know.

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,590
What's the second trial?

8
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:19,558
An innocent soul
has to be rescued from hell

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,626
and delivered unto heaven.

10
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:22,311
Aah!
Sam?

11
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,846
It's done.

12
00:00:25,216 --> 00:00:28,384
Kevin tran. Thought you could
elude me forever.

13
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:29,685
He's gone.

14
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:31,186
The little geek
made a run for it.

15
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,700
What the hell?

16
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:58,974
What the hell is this?

17
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:16,742
"1951"?

00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:09,678
Y--

21
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:12,548
Man,
I'm telling you,

22
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,166
give me five minutes
with some clippers, and --

23
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:15,717
Oh, shut up.

24
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:19,171
Uh, what time
did I lay down?

25
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:21,306
You took a siesta
around noon...

26
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:22,808
Yesterday.

27
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:29,514
I'm sorry. Uh...

28
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:32,350
That's why we don't have
nice things, Sam.

29
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:33,819
You okay?

30
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,372
Yeah,
I'm -- I'm fine.

31
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:40,793
Just, uh,
you know what?

32
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:42,461
I'm gonna get dressed.
We should go find Kevin.

33
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:43,862
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

34
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:45,798
Easy, easy,
sleeping beauty.

35
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,799
Look, man.

36
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:48,967
I've hacked
into every security camera

37
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:50,752
around Garth's houseboat,
Kevin's hometown,

38
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:51,753
where Mrs. Tran lived.

39
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:52,754
And?

40
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:54,756
Well, nothing so far.

41
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:56,175
Dean,
we have to find him.

42
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:57,342
I know. I know.

43
00:03:57,344 --> 00:03:59,044
Look, Garth is out
looking for him.

44
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:00,646
We've got a Hunter A.P.B.
out on Kevin.

45
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:02,714
We will do what we can
from here.

46
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:04,216
While you get better.

47
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:05,851
I'm fine.

48
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,219
Dean,
I can still go out there.

49
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:08,220
I can still hunt.

50
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:09,354
Really?

51
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:20,782
This is stupid.

52
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:26,839
All right.

53
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:27,923
You hit that target,

54
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:29,541
we'll talk about
you getting back out there.

55
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:31,243
No problem.

56
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:45,257
Look, man,
that second trial hit you

57
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:46,608
a lot harder than
that first one.

58
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,694
I don't know whether it was
just more intense or what.

59
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:51,213
It felt the same...

60
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:53,398
Till the next day.

61
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,235
So, we're gonna sit tight,

62
00:04:56,237 --> 00:05:00,489
keep an eye out
until you, uh, get better.

63
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:14,987
It's from Charlie.

64
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,123
"In the neighborhood,
found you guys a case""

65
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,508
Found us a case?

66
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,809
"In the neighborhood"?

67
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:22,060
How the hell's she know
where we are?

68
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:24,129
Uh...Well, she doesn't.

69
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:25,464
Not exactly, at least.

70
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:27,683
It says she tracked our cells
to a 20-mile radius,

71
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:28,817
then the signal went out.

72
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,269
Huh.

73
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:31,320
This place must be

74
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:32,905
in some kind of,
like, Bermuda Triangle.

75
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:34,072
What, are you saying

76
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:35,407
that we can make and receive
phone calls from here

77
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,325
and nobody can track us?

78
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,493
Man, I love this place.

79
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:51,006
Your highness.

80
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,325
What's up, bitches?

81
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:02,050
You okay, Sam?

82
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:04,002
Yeah. No, I'm --
I'm good. Yeah.

83
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:06,138
What are you doing
in Kansas?

84
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,507
Uh, a comic convention,
in Topeka.

85
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:11,727
In the middle
of the week?

86
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:13,779
Girl's got to get
her collectibles.

87
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,899
So, you gonna invite me
into your dungeon,

88
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:20,518
or do I got to answer
your questions three first?

89
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,187
Follow us.

90
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:24,573
Let us introduce you
to the Men of Letters.

91
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:26,458
Holy awesome.

92
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,676
Too bad
they got wiped out,

93
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,044
though
that is what they get

94
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:30,128
for the sexist name.

95
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:32,848
Well, anyway,
that's our skinny.

96
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,032
How about you?

97
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:36,585
Um...

98
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:38,203
Made a deal with
the Yesteryear weirdos.

99
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:41,273
We're gonna team up
to stomp the Shadow Orcs.

100
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,375
You guys are still coming
to the midyear jubilee, right?

101
00:06:43,377 --> 00:06:45,177
Wouldn't miss it.

102
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:47,212
So, what about
this case you brought us?

103
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:48,480
Oh.

104
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:51,716
When I was in Topeka,
I saw this pop up over the wire.

105
00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:54,936
Tom Blake,
a checkout clerk in Salina

106
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:57,072
who went missing
on his way home from work --

107
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:58,857
he was found dead yesterday.

108
00:06:58,859 --> 00:06:59,941
His insides?

109
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:01,243
Liquefied.

110
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:03,245
Locals have
no idea what happened.

111
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:05,831
They tried to bury the report
so people wouldn't freak,

112
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,332
but I flagged it.

113
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:08,583
I have eliminated

114
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:10,118
the following things
that go bump in the night.

115
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,203
Wait a second.

116
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:12,754
When did you become
such an expert?

117
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:16,958
Well, after you guys left,
I dug into all things monstrous.

118
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,378
I'm a wee bit obsessive...

119
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,680
If "a wee bit"
means completely.

120
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:26,084
I also found this series
of books by Carver Edlund.

121
00:07:27,553 --> 00:07:30,222
Did those books
really happen?

122
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:33,942
Wow.

123
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:36,261
That is some meta-madness.

124
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:38,230
Thanks for saving the world
and stuff.

125
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:40,365
Sorry you have
zero luck with the ladies.

126
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:42,284
Wha--

127
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:43,935
we need to find every single
copy of those books

128
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:45,020
and burn them.

129
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:47,072
They're online now,
so good luck with that.

130
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,458
Awesome.

131
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,710
Well, you two crazy kids
deal with that.

132
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:53,712
I will go see
if there's anything to this,

133
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:55,113
uh, case of yours.

134
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:56,614
I'm coming with you.

135
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,967
Whoa. Are you sure
you're okay?

136
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:00,502
- Yes.
- No.

137
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:02,287
You're taking a knee
as long as you're off your game.

138
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,473
I'll go with you.

139
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:05,974
Look,
no disrespect, okay,

140
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:07,676
but there is
a big difference

141
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:10,228
between reading about hunting
and actually hunting.

142
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,647
I'm coming with.

143
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:15,567
For serious?

144
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:16,902
Okay.

145
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:17,986
Now, if you can hit
that target,

146
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:19,354
then we can
talk about you --

147
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:26,478
What?

148
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,148
All right, if you're gonna do
a ride-along, then, uh...

149
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,868
You got to lose
the novelty T-shirts.

150
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:36,338
Son of a pantsuit.

151
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:44,079
? Yeah, yeah

152
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:48,433
? I used to think
maybe you loved me ?

153
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:51,520
? now, baby, I'm sure

154
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,640
? and I just can't wait

155
00:08:55,642 --> 00:09:00,195
? till the day
when you knock on my door ?

156
00:09:04,284 --> 00:09:05,700
Montage.

157
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:15,360
Trials?
That's never good.

158
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:16,661
Yeah, and our Prophet's
in the wind.

159
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:18,663
What about, uh, Castiel?

160
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:21,082
He seems
helpful and dreamy.

161
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:22,467
He's M.I.A.,

162
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:24,753
with a tablet of his own
doing God knows what.

163
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:27,973
I mean, to be honest,
this whole thing is...

164
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:29,707
I mean, Sam's a tough
son of a bitch,

165
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,726
but Cass was saying
that these trials

166
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,808
are messing with him in ways
that even he can't heal.

167
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:38,600
If it's any consolation,
having read your history --

168
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:40,986
there is pretty much nothing
the Winchesters can't do

169
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:41,937
if they work together.

170
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:43,738
Thanks.

171
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,408
Must be nice,
having a brother,

172
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,527
someone to always
watch your back.

173
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:49,694
Yeah.

174
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:51,329
No brothers or sisters?

175
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:53,582
Actually, I have two.

176
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:57,536
Their names are
Xbox and PS3.

177
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:01,206
I'm not getting
any reception.

178
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,207
Can I use your phone?

179
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,843
Mm. Sure.

180
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:10,632
Yeah?
Hey. It's me.

181
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:11,566
You okay?

182
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:13,752
Yes, Dean,
I'm still fine.

183
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:15,437
Look, I can hunt.
Well, let the healing continue.

184
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:17,422
I'll check in with you
later.

185
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:29,534
Close enough.

186
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:34,823
Come in.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,950
Hi.
Uh, Special Agent Hicks.

188
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:47,836
This is my partner,
Special Agent Ripley.

189
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:50,472
We're here about the body
with the creamy filling.

190
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:52,207
Ah, right.

191
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,791
I didn't think you guys
would have any interest in that.

192
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:55,360
FBI, ma'am.

193
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:56,794
We never leave a stone
unturned.

194
00:10:56,796 --> 00:10:57,846
Mind if we take a peek?

195
00:10:57,848 --> 00:10:59,064
Of course not.

196
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:00,849
I just need your signed
chain-of-custody request,

197
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:02,234
and it's all yours.

198
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:03,685
I'm sorry. The what?

199
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:06,321
Chain-of-custody request
from your supervisor to mine.

200
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,273
Right.

201
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:11,476
Uh, you know what?

202
00:11:11,478 --> 00:11:13,328
You want to call
my supervisor?

203
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,996
I'm sure he can give you
the override or whatever.

204
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:16,765
Yeah, I'm sorry.

205
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:17,949
Unless he can get me
the form,

206
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:19,868
I can't give you access
to the body.

207
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,487
But...FBI.

208
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:27,208
I understand, dear,
but paperwork is paperwork.

209
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,793
Of course.

210
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:31,630
Jennifer.
Uh, it is Jennifer?

211
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:33,164
Yeah.
Yeah.

212
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,500
Um, we have been
on the road all day,

213
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:38,136
and this
is strictly routine,

214
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:40,221
dot-the-"I," cross-the-"T"
kind of thing.

215
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:44,242
If you could do us
a solid...

216
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,319
Come back
with the signed form.

217
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:56,721
I'd be happy
to do you a solid.

218
00:11:56,723 --> 00:11:58,856
Until then...

219
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:03,244
That never happened
in the books.

220
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:04,963
You want to tell me happened
back there, Boo Radley?

221
00:12:04,965 --> 00:12:06,864
I'm sorry.
I-I froze.

222
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:08,967
I couldn't
control-alt-delete my way out.

223
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:10,919
Real-life role-playing
is hard.

224
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:12,220
It's okay.

225
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:13,722
We'll come back later

226
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:16,057
when, uh, Doris Do Right
isn't here anymore.

227
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,393
Oh, perfect.
Breaking and entering.

228
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:19,761
No different than hacking.

229
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:21,146
Beg to differ.

230
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:22,931
One I've been doing
since I was a teenager.

231
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,232
The other
I've done once

232
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,351
with you two idiots
walking me through it,

233
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:28,019
and I had my arm broken
in the process.

234
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:29,621
What did you hack
when you were a teenager?

235
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,440
Uh...NORAD.

236
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,394
Yeah. Whatever you say,
"Wargames."

237
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:38,496
Why don't we go grab some grub
while we wait?

238
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:47,905
Awesome.
I got three stars.

239
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:49,457
So?

240
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:52,627
I'm three levels
ahead of you, man.

241
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:57,048
Dude, stop.

242
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,916
I can't.
I'm just too good.

243
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:00,518
Dude!

244
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:15,817
Whoa. No, dude.

245
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,202
That's a bad idea.

246
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:20,071
Your face is a bad idea.

247
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,629
See?
Nothing to worry about.

248
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,741
Aaaaah! Aaaaah!

249
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:55,604
Maybe you should
go first this time.

250
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:56,539
Unh-unh.

251
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,491
Back on the horse, kiddo.
Come on.

252
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:05,831
Hey, there.

253
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,500
I am
Special Agent Ripley.

254
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:08,584
This is my partner.

255
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:09,785
Save it.

256
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:11,921
Your other agent's
over there.

257
00:14:19,062 --> 00:14:20,262
What took you guys
so long?

258
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:21,797
What the hell
are you doing here?

259
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,933
Working the case.
Same as you.

260
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:25,601
Jake Hill. Librarian.

261
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,603
Went missing yesterday,
no relation to the other vic.

262
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,322
Coroner
already swooped in

263
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:30,873
and scooped up
what was left of him.

264
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,075
Yeah. Yeah, we met her.
Bit of a stickler.

265
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:34,927
Well, there's, uh, not a body,
nothing else to see here,

266
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,095
so why don't you
head on home?

267
00:14:37,598 --> 00:14:39,315
Still haven't
talked to the witnesses.

268
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:41,917
Well,
we can handle that.

269
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,035
Charlie, why don't you
go talk to the witnesses?

270
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:44,670
But I don't want to miss
the "bro-ment."

271
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:46,655
Charlie!

272
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:50,509
Look, man,
I know you're frustrated,

273
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:51,510
but you're also sick.

274
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:52,712
I'm not leaving, Dean.

275
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:54,430
Hey, boys.

276
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:59,301
Special Agent Ripley,
FBI and...stuff.

277
00:14:59,303 --> 00:15:00,686
What game
you guys playing?

278
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:02,188
"Super Eater."

279
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,173
"Underworld Adventures"
or "Dimension Travelers"?

280
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:05,691
"Underworld Adventures."

281
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:07,393
Nice.

282
00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:12,347
So, about that childhood trauma
you experienced earlier.

283
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,202
I know you want to help.
I do, all right?

284
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:17,352
But --

285
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:19,955
Dean, you cannot take care
of the both of us.

286
00:15:19,957 --> 00:15:21,907
I need to be out here.

287
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:23,409
"Play through the pain""
right?

288
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:24,794
Come on, man.
Don't quote me to me.

289
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:26,962
So, the boys said

290
00:15:26,964 --> 00:15:28,214
they noticed something
on the body's arm

291
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:30,633
before it covered them
in years of future therapy.

292
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:32,551
Said it looked like
a blue handprint.

293
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:34,837
Sounds like something
you should read about.

294
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:35,871
In a book. At home.

295
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:36,972
I'm not leaving

296
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:39,708
until we find out
whatever's doing this.

297
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,677
Whatever.

298
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:44,379
You guys fight like
an old married couple.

299
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:45,815
Charlie.

300
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:47,066
Does this mean

301
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:49,309
we don't have to break into
the coroner's office anymore?

302
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:51,654
That's a great idea.

303
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:57,726
Is he leaving?

304
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:58,778
He's leaving.

305
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,945
That's all right.

306
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:01,163
I stole your car.
I think I know where he's going.

307
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:03,032
Come on.
Cool.

308
00:16:03,034 --> 00:16:06,001
Wait, you stole my car?

309
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:19,215
What took you so long?

310
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,301
I stopped for gas.

311
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:25,221
Shut up.
The body's in here.

312
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:29,175
The hell?

313
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:31,861
Charlie!

314
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:33,963
Charlie!

315
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:39,819
It's the coroner.

316
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:40,820
I got this.

317
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,457
Hello.

318
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,426
Hey, there.

319
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:06,145
Front door was open.

320
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,731
Oh.

321
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,132
Uh, w-what are you
doing here?

322
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:13,102
I, uh, came back

323
00:17:13,104 --> 00:17:16,489
to get a blank copy
of that form you asked for.

324
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,159
The FBI doesn't have
chain-of-custody forms?

325
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:23,529
The field office
had a power outage

326
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:25,114
after catching fire.

327
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:27,700
Figured I could just borrow
a copy or two.

328
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:30,669
Of course.
Just give me sec.

329
00:17:34,324 --> 00:17:35,958
What the hell?

330
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:39,879
It's empty.

331
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:42,715
Uh...

332
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:43,632
They burned the bodies.

333
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:45,217
Already?
Yeah.

334
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:47,853
They think it's some kind
of, like, outbreak scenario.

335
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:49,638
Even got the CDC
to sign off on it.

336
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,440
These folks
run a tight ship.

337
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:55,728
Okay.

338
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,779
Here you go.

339
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:58,447
Great.

340
00:17:58,449 --> 00:17:59,665
Perfect.

341
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,150
Thank you.

342
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,651
Well,
if you'll excuse me,

343
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:04,870
I have some work to do
in the morgue.

344
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:08,324
Uh, can I ask you
a personal question?

345
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:11,744
I am new
to the whole power-suit thing,

346
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:13,379
and yours...

347
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:14,547
is killer.

348
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:16,215
Where do you get them?

349
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:18,467
Does this mean we need
to take "Silkwood" showers now,

350
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:19,785
or is this
still a case?

351
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:22,221
Yeah. Something about that Mark
the kid saw rings a bell.

352
00:18:22,223 --> 00:18:23,872
Probably have to check the lore --

353
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:25,374
or maybe dad's journal.

354
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,094
Hurry up.

355
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:31,347
All you need are three jackets,
three pairs of pants,

356
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:32,815
and you're all set.

357
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:34,650
So simple, so smart.

358
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:36,068
You should have a blog.

359
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,070
Okay.
I'll get right on that.

360
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,745
Um, so,
what about shoes?

361
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,697
I can never find
the right kind to go with --

362
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:51,333
Okay. I'm sorry,
but I'm not a stylist.

363
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,575
Uh, well...

364
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:02,795
Thanks for the forms
and the fashion advice.

365
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:04,463
You're the best.

366
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:05,580
Don't go changing.

367
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:07,549
'Kay, bye.

368
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:14,023
Leviathan?

369
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:15,391
Mm...

370
00:19:15,393 --> 00:19:17,592
They consume their prey.

371
00:19:17,594 --> 00:19:20,129
Well, maybe the vics
were Leviathan.

372
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:24,650
No black goo on either scene,
according to the reports.

373
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:25,951
Dragons. They, uh --

374
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:28,070
No signs of burns
on the vics.

375
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:31,924
I hate that thing.

376
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:33,158
I want one.

377
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,376
Wait a second.

378
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:35,944
Djinn.

379
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:37,830
Djinn vics
don't get liquefied.

380
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:39,999
No, no, no, no.
Not regular Djinn.

381
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:42,251
According to this,
there is a bastard offshoot.

382
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:44,370
Uh, their eyes
light up blue.

383
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:46,722
They pass as humans,
all that regular jazz.

384
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:48,057
Except these
"leave their victims

385
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,025
with jelly-like insides""

386
00:19:50,027 --> 00:19:52,177
and supposedly,
when they poison their victims,

387
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:54,263
they leave behind
a blue handprint.

388
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,683
I hate that thing.

389
00:19:57,685 --> 00:19:59,234
And I want one.

390
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:01,487
So, do these things
die like regular Djinn?

391
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:03,656
Silver blade dipped
in lamb's blood, yeah.

392
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:05,741
Now we just got to find
the asshat.

393
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:07,309
All right.

394
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:10,112
Well, breakthrough means
snack time to me.

395
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:13,482
And I want to just,
uh, stretch my legs.

396
00:20:13,484 --> 00:20:15,150
I will pick us up
some grub,

397
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:18,087
and unlike you, Sam,
I will not forget the pie.

398
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:25,511
She seem
a little off to you?

399
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:27,680
Since the second
she got here.

400
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:45,526
Charlie...

401
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:46,369
it's Sam.

402
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,922
Uh...Again, call us.

403
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:50,206
Okay?

404
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,718
Hey.

405
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,688
Any word from Charlie?

406
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,389
Uh, no.

407
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,192
And there was
no comic convention in Topeka.

408
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,260
I don't know why.

409
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,995
I mean,
why would she lie to us?

410
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,649
One way to find out.

411
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:17,951
What are you doing?

412
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:19,736
When I called you
from her phone,

413
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:20,787
I turned on her GPS.

414
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,406
Charlie?

415
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,841
Hey, Charlie,
you in there?

416
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:29,429
Dean.

417
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:44,427
The hell?

418
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,699
What the hell
is this place?

419
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,788
Whatever it is,
it belongs to Charlie.

420
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,123
Or some variation of her.

421
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,327
Who the hell is she --
Jason Bourne?

422
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:02,111
All right, so,
we got no forced entry,

423
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:04,180
so either it was somebody
that she knew or --

424
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,165
Djinn.

425
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,618
Here's
all our missed calls.

426
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,886
You got anything
on her laptop?

427
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,137
Yeah.

428
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,057
Uh, she's been making donations
through her aliases

429
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,643
to Shawnee County General
here in Topeka.

430
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,044
Like, a charity?

431
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:19,930
A patient.
Gertrude Middleton.

432
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:22,849
We need answers.
Uh, I'll take Gertrude.

433
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:24,634
You keep Djinn-digging.

434
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,741
Gertrude's been in a persistent
vegetative state for 16 years.

435
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,077
About a year ago,
her condition got worse.

436
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,797
This ventilator's the only thing
keeping her alive.

437
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,349
How did this happen?

438
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,918
She and her husband
were hit by a drunk driver.

439
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,720
He didn't make it.

440
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,971
They were on their way

441
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:46,606
to pick up their daughter
from a sleepover.

442
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,324
Their daughter?

443
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,326
She was 12.

444
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:53,129
She got into trouble
after her parents' accident.

445
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:57,100
Nobody's
heard from her since.

446
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,318
Folks have been donating

447
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,936
to cover Gertrude's care
over the years.

448
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:04,724
It's a sweet gesture,
but the truth is, she's gone.

449
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:06,342
She ever get any visitors?

450
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,444
A couple nurses said
they thought

451
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,962
they saw someone
in here reading to her,

452
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:12,616
but nobody's ever officially
signed in to visit her.

453
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,183
She's all alone.

454
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,653
If you'll excuse me,
I have to make my rounds.

455
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,622
Thank you.

456
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:36,039
You got one hell of a daughter,
Mrs. Middleton.

457
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,541
I promise you I will find her.

458
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:44,180
You're not going anywhere.

459
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,381
Wilhelm scream.

460
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,691
Do you know
what I smell on you?

461
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,911
Deodorant?
A little pee, maybe?

462
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,246
Fear.

463
00:25:01,415 --> 00:25:03,533
Djinn smell fear?

464
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,869
Well, well, well.

465
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:06,953
If you know about Djinn,

466
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:08,838
then you
and your little friend

467
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,290
are Hunters, not FBI.

468
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,942
No. I'm --
I'm more hunter-in-training.

469
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,761
Totally
not worth killing.

470
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,247
Oh, but you are worth killing,
sweetheart.

471
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:19,933
Yeah.

472
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,269
You see, my kind --

473
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,188
we prefer
a more bitter taste to blood

474
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,357
than
the run-of-the-mill Djinn.

475
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,392
We prefer
the taste of fear.

476
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:33,113
And when I got a whiff of you
at that morgue...

477
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:36,633
Oh, such delicious fear
inside of you.

478
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,201
I followed your scent.

479
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,603
I knew you'd make a meal
fit for two.

480
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:44,074
For two?

481
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,242
No.

482
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:59,005
So, no chance
of a recovery, huh?

483
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:00,140
No.

484
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,591
No, Gertrude seemed like
a cool mom, too --

485
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,811
kind, strong, taken from
her family way too young.

486
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,312
Remind you of anybody?

487
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,648
Did you find anything?

488
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,150
I think so.

489
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,935
A John Doe
from nine years ago.

490
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,804
The original coroner
wanted the body sent to the CDC,

491
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,072
but the coroner's
new assistant

492
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,141
"accidentally" ordered
the body to be burned.

493
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,610
New assistant?
Jennifer O'Brien.

494
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:24,480
Coroner's a hell of a cover
for hiding kills.

495
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,285
My manly man friend's
gonna come get you,

496
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,454
you creepy power-suit lady.

497
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,289
Oh, let him come.

498
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,126
He reeked of fear,
as well.

499
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:43,666
Look at this. CDC?

500
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,718
Never heard from Jennifer
this time, either.

501
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,736
She faked the reports,

502
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,171
burned the bodies
to cover her tracks.

503
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,006
Why'd she get sloppy again
after nine years,

504
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,491
start leaving the bodies
where they could be found?

505
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:53,276
Well, let's go ask her.

506
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,727
According to this,

507
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:56,980
she owns two pieces
of property in town --

508
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,348
one 2-bedroom house
about 10 minutes from here

509
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,534
and an abandoned
shipping warehouse.

510
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,486
Of course she does.

511
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:31,047
Charlie.

512
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,548
Charlie.

513
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,549
Hey.

514
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,318
Hey, Charlie.

515
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,608
You okay?

516
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,809
Where's Charlie?

517
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,993
What the hell's going on?

518
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:35,578
I don't know.

519
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,579
Uh, different Djinn.

520
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:37,981
Maybe she needs
a different antidote.

521
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,049
Charlie?

522
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,084
She's burning up, man.

523
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,418
We're not letting her
turn to jello.

524
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,452
Okay, okay.

525
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:44,721
Uh...Okay.

526
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,256
Djinn poison puts your brain
into something like

527
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:47,991
a feedback loop
while your blood boils, right?

528
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:49,142
Right.

529
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,593
Um, if the antidote
didn't break the loop,

530
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,061
then maybe we can find a way
to break from the inside.

531
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,796
I mean, Djinn take you
to your happy place.

532
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:54,981
Your happy place
is like a dream.

533
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,433
African dream root.

534
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:16,152
All right.
Let's do this.

535
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,992
Ugh.

536
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,160
Okay.

537
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,963
All right, I'm gonna need
to go to sleep fast,

538
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,514
so, uh, punch me.

539
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,300
Look, man,
I know you don't want to, okay?

540
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,269
Aah.

541
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,355
Wow, you're a little
off your game there

542
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,390
'cause that was, uh,
that was pretty --

543
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:21,851
Come with me
if you want to live.

544
00:30:22,736 --> 00:30:24,654
I've always wanted
to say that.

545
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you doing
in my dream?

546
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,775
You were attacked
by a Djinn.

547
00:30:28,777 --> 00:30:30,493
The coroner,
Jennifer, remember?

548
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,829
Djinn usually send you to your,
uh, happy, your happy place.

549
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,580
No judgment,

550
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,948
but you got a really strange
sense of happy, kiddo.

551
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,383
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

552
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:39,419
Jennifer said that her kind
feeds off fear.

553
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,921
This isn't my happy place.

554
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,572
This is a recurring nightmare
of mine.

555
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:45,725
What is this?
It's a video game.

556
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:46,959
Wait a second.

557
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:48,044
You're telling me that this
whole thing is a video game?

558
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,762
It was called
"The Red Scare."

559
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,881
Uh, first-person shooter
against super-soldier vampires.

560
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,516
I copied it off of
a game company's server

561
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,851
before it was finished,

562
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,253
reprogrammed it to reflect
my flamingly liberal politics,

563
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,305
and then I released it
for free.

564
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:01,691
Then they tracked me down
and had me arrested.

565
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,892
I was 12.

566
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,194
And you've been on the run
ever since.

567
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,906
So, how do we
get out of here?

568
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,041
I don't know.

569
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,325
We gave you the Djinn antidote.
It didn't take.

570
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:20,493
And I killed the Djinn.

571
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:22,495
Both of them?

572
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:38,461
You killed my mom.

573
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:51,527
We got to get back
and help Sammy.

574
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:52,644
Tell me about this game.

575
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:53,862
Maybe if we can win --

576
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,989
Look, I don't know
how long I've been out,

577
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:06,375
but I've been through this level
a thousand times already.

578
00:32:06,377 --> 00:32:07,509
What?

579
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:08,627
Every time I beat the level
and save the patients,

580
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:10,129
I get reset
back to the beginning,

581
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:12,431
only there's less weapons
and the vampires are faster.

582
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:18,187
It's an infinite loop.

583
00:32:18,189 --> 00:32:20,505
Like Pac-Man
without level 256.

584
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:21,774
Level what?

585
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:23,275
Nothing.

586
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,177
Wait, what patients?

587
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:39,324
Charlie?

588
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:41,910
I know who this is.

589
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:49,835
What are you talking about?

590
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:50,786
When you went missing,

591
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:52,621
me and Sam found
your little crash pad.

592
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:56,675
We saw the payments
that you make for her.

593
00:32:56,677 --> 00:33:01,379
So, I went and visited your mom,
looking for you.

594
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:06,685
She's why I'm in Kansas.

595
00:33:11,107 --> 00:33:13,025
I sneak into the hospital
whenever I can,

596
00:33:13,027 --> 00:33:17,830
and I just --
I read to her.

597
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:22,518
She used to read me to sleep
at night when I was a kid.

598
00:33:25,222 --> 00:33:27,906
She'd read me
"The Hobbit."

599
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:34,346
She's the reason
I love the stuff I love.

600
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,749
I'm sorry for your loss.

601
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:41,086
She's not gone.

602
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,152
Sam?

603
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,107
Is this my nightmare
or yours?

604
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:17,622
So...

605
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:20,425
It wasn't your mama
who messed up.

606
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:21,426
It was you.

607
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:23,679
Shut up!

608
00:34:24,764 --> 00:34:26,464
I just came of age.
I had to feed.

609
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:28,600
I screwed up.

610
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:30,602
M-mom knew
how to cover her tracks.

611
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:32,654
She always told me
not to play with my food.

612
00:34:34,608 --> 00:34:36,575
Maybe you should have
listened to your mom.

613
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:43,648
This is it --
the boss battle.

614
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,833
Come on,
we got to save the patients.

615
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:46,001
Wait, wait.

616
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:48,787
You said that we're stuck
in a loop, right?

617
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,506
And out there in the real world,
you're dying.

618
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:51,623
And I might be, too.

619
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:54,826
We got to find a way
to break this loop.

620
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:57,495
Okay. How?

621
00:34:58,631 --> 00:35:01,333
I think the only way
to stop this is to not play.

622
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:02,634
What?

623
00:35:02,636 --> 00:35:04,686
No. No.
We've got to save them.

624
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,138
Nut up, Winchester.

625
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:09,441
See?
You can't stop, either.

626
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,776
Listen to me,
this poison --

627
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:12,611
it's designed to put your mind
into an endless cycle

628
00:35:12,613 --> 00:35:14,512
while your insides
turn to mush, okay?

629
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:16,365
And its fuel is fear.

630
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,016
Now, call me crazy,
but I think

631
00:35:18,018 --> 00:35:19,351
the only way
to break this cycle

632
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:21,186
is to let go of the fear
and stop playing the game.

633
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:23,688
You don't know that.

634
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,908
I know that your fear
is creating all of this.

635
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,627
But you're not afraid of those
super-soldier vamps out there,

636
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,295
you're not
afraid of this game,

637
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:31,747
and you're not afraid
of what it did to you.

638
00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:34,716
Hey. Look at me.

639
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:37,419
You're afraid
of losing her.

640
00:35:37,421 --> 00:35:39,871
Charlie,
she's already gone.

641
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:41,590
No. You don't understand.

642
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:42,841
You don't understand.

643
00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:48,263
I was at a sleepover,
and I got scared, so...

644
00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:52,651
I called my parents
to come and get me.

645
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:54,803
They should never have been
driving that night.

646
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:56,905
It wasn't your fault.

647
00:35:56,907 --> 00:36:00,692
I just
want to tell her that I'm sorry

648
00:36:00,694 --> 00:36:02,560
and I love her

649
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:04,246
and just have her
hear it again.

650
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:07,082
I just need her to hear that
one more time.

651
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:09,734
But she can't.
She can't.

652
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:11,069
I know.

653
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:13,905
Believe me, I know.

654
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:15,740
But you got to let her go.

655
00:36:19,212 --> 00:36:20,846
Game over, kiddo.

656
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:15,684
Mom?

657
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:17,819
Dean.

658
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:20,472
Dean. Hey, hey!

659
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:21,490
Come here.

660
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:23,275
You okay?
What happened?

661
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:25,310
What happened?
I'm okay.

662
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:29,698
Charlie?

663
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:35,787
I'm sorry.

664
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:37,506
I had to.

665
00:38:06,843 --> 00:38:09,595
So, thanks
for saving our bacon.

666
00:38:10,731 --> 00:38:12,965
Any time,
your highness.

667
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:17,937
You know you're gonna
be okay, right?

668
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:23,859
Those books portray you as,
like, one tough customer.

669
00:38:23,861 --> 00:38:27,413
If anyone can get through
the trials, Sam, it's you.

670
00:38:27,415 --> 00:38:28,747
Thanks.

671
00:38:28,749 --> 00:38:30,583
You know,
you really should come back

672
00:38:30,585 --> 00:38:31,917
and dig through
our archives.

673
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:36,121
You are definitely
a Woman of Letters.

674
00:38:36,123 --> 00:38:37,590
I like the sound of that.

675
00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:50,335
Well, thanks for
stopping by, Charlie.

676
00:38:50,337 --> 00:38:52,388
Always wanted
to get "Tron"ed.

677
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,474
What's next for you?

678
00:38:57,478 --> 00:39:00,412
Gonna go by the hospital.

679
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:06,518
Got to let go, right?

680
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,203
What about you?

681
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:09,538
You gonna let it go?

682
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,024
Never.

683
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,079
That's my boys.

684
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,699
I love you.

685
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:24,470
I know.

686
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:50,996
Okay, look,
you were right.

687
00:39:50,998 --> 00:39:52,498
I-I should have laid low.
I-I know.

688
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,668
I should have hung back.
But I'm glad I was able --

689
00:40:03,928 --> 00:40:06,211
What do you say
we find our Prophet?

690
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,774
Take all the time you need
with your mom, okay?

691
00:41:18,201 --> 00:41:20,636
One last time, okay?

692
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:33,182
"In a hole in the ground,
there lived a hobbit.

693
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,634
"Not a nasty, dirty,
wet hole,

694
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:40,005
"filled with the ends of worms
and an oozy smell,

695
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:43,508
"nor yet a dry, bare,
sandy hole

696
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,713
"with nothing in it
to sit down on or to eat --

697
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:51,322
it was a hobbit-hole,
and that means comfort."
