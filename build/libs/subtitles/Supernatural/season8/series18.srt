1
00:00:01,576 --> 00:00:04,446
A cross won't repel them.
Sunlight won't kill them.

2
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:07,059
But the bloodlust --
that part's true.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,667
That was vampire blood
he dosed you with.

4
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:11,500
Lights are too bright?
Sunshine hurt your skin?

5
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:13,768
I get so hungry.

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,503
Just so you know,
911's on speed-dial.

7
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:19,504
Krissy, you can trust me.
So your dad's on the road right now?

8
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:20,939
Been gone a while?

9
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:24,743
My dad left,
and he didn't come back.

10
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:25,644
So I'm coming with you.

11
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:27,508
No. Hell, no.
I'm coming!

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,998
Why is that waitress
getting into that truck?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,355
All right. Come on.
Give it up. Good work.

14
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:34,889
You're a dweeb.

15
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:39,526
Hold on -- I got you!
Dean!

16
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:41,662
He can't help you.
No one can.

17
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,466
I guess I'll have
to help myself, then.

18
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:49,269
I'm retiring.

19
00:00:50,537 --> 00:00:52,703
We're so lame.
Yeah, we are.

20
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:53,870
Take care of yourself.

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,982
? It's cold outside ?

22
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:07,650
? and I'm not quite ?

23
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:12,986
? ready for the morning light ?

24
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:16,023
? oh, oh, oh ?

25
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:18,992
? my hands are tied ?

26
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:20,560
? 'cause if I tried ?

27
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:26,199
? to leave this place,
I'd surely die ?

28
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:32,971
? hey ?

29
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,539
? hey ?

30
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,973
? hey ?

31
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:38,209
? I'd surely die ?

32
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,210
What was that?

33
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:41,645
? I'd surely die ?
What?

34
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,051
? Hey ?
There's no one out here but us, krissy.

35
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,385
? Hey ?

36
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:49,853
? hey ?

37
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:51,588
? I'd surely die ?

38
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,356
What?

39
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:56,693
? I'd surely die ?

40
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:12,409
No, no. No, no, no.

41
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,980
Okay.

42
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:28,126
No. No. Don't leave me here!
Aidan!

43
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,394
Don't leave me here!

44
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:32,264
Oh, God.

45
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:52,119
You okay?

46
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:54,555
That was close.

47
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:56,523
Next time one of you
can be the bait.

48
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:05,966
It's him.

49
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:09,803
One down. Two to go.

50
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:15,472

52
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:35,227
so, what are
we looking at again?

53
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,233
"Two young women found
near the freeway

54
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:41,367
with their throats
ripped out."

55
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:43,436
Sounds vampy to me.

56
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:45,071
Yeah, maybe.

57
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:48,575
Listen, if you want to
take a knee on this one

58
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,477
if you're not feeling
up to it...

59
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,845
What?

60
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:54,347
You know, the trials,
what Cass said,

61
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,583
that you got
what he can't cure.

62
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:58,385
Hmm, which means what,
exactly?

63
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:00,821
Well, I don't know.
You tell me. Are you okay?

64
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,357
I'm fine.
Are <i>you</i> okay?

65
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,892
Me?

66
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:07,461
Yeah. Um,
Cass dinged you up pretty good.

67
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:09,897
And?

68
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:13,734
And I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

69
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:15,303
What,
like my feelings?

70
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:18,472
If that's what you want to
talk about, sure.

71
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:25,480
Okay.

72
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:26,949
I'll tell you what.

73
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:28,585
Why don't I go get some,
uh, herbal tea.

74
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:29,115
Okay.

75
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,722
And you can find some
cowboy junkies on the dial.

76
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:31,856
Eat me, Dean.

77
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:33,524
And you know what?
We'll just talk it out.

78
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,060
Good talk.

79
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:41,263
Nay, great talk!
Very healthy!

80
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:43,665
FBI?

81
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,034
You're here about the lady
killer murders, aren't you?

82
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,136
The lady killer murders?

83
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:49,770
Yeah,
coined it myself.

84
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:51,972
Congratulations.
What can you tell us?

85
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:56,010
Well, both victims were female,
under 21,

86
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:57,778
and here's the kicker --

87
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,180
they were drained
of all their blood.

88
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:01,315
Huh.

89
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:04,650
Exactly.
We found that strange, also.

90
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:07,352
But then last night,
things got even stranger.

91
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:08,486
Last night?
Yeah.

92
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,356
We set up a security cam
on Fuller's Point

93
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:12,691
for safety purposes.

94
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:16,328
It's where our local young
people like to go make out.

95
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,330
Last night,
things got crazy.

96
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:25,836
Hell of a thing,
ain't it?

97
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:27,739
Uh, you I.D.
any of these people?

98
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,307
Well, not yet.

99
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:31,408
Crime scene was empty
when we got there.

100
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,976
No vic, no nothing.

101
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:37,747
Uh, I'm thinking it's some kind
of cult or a drug thing.

102
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:42,352
So I put a statewide A.P.B. out
on these three

103
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:43,919
about an hour ago.

104
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:45,954
I'm gonna need you
to call that off.

105
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:47,455
And we're gonna need
this footage.

106
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:48,790
What?

107
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,658
Sheriff,
why do you think we're here?

108
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:53,627
You just crossed streams
with a federal investigation.

109
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:55,829
Now, I suggest you cooperate,
call off your A.P.B.,

110
00:05:55,831 --> 00:05:58,031
or you're gonna find yourself
in a world of hurt.

111
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,067
Uh...

112
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:04,705
Right.

113
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:07,474
So, what was that
all about, G-man?

114
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,943
You remember
Krissy Chambers?

115
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,345
Uh, yeah, the Vetalas case,
right?

116
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:13,213
They were working
that truck stop by the freeway.

117
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:14,881
She and her dad
helped us shut 'em down.

118
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:16,383
Right, and then he promised
to go civilian

119
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:17,851
so she wouldn't
grow up to be a hunter.

120
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:19,886
Well, guess who the star
of this snuff film is?

121
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:21,554
Come on.

122
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:23,423
Well, maybe he doesn't know
she's doing this.

123
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,325
What, sneaking out
in the middle of the night

124
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:27,326
to go hunt monsters
with the Apple Dumpling gang?

125
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:29,428
Is that what kids are doing
for kicks these days?

126
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,430
Okay. Then maybe he knows,
and he's helping her out.

127
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,698
What, get caught
on "Candid Camera"?

128
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:37,836
Let's just go find her before
she gets into any more trouble.

129
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,612
You're 25?

130
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,717
Actually,
I think I'm 40.

131
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,513
I told you...
I have a boyfriend.

132
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:22,850
Then how come I couldn't
find him in your cellie?

133
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:24,252
Because we only Skype.

134
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:27,255
Right. And let me guess --
he also lives in Canada?

135
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:29,625
You know, he does, actually.
Oh.

136
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:31,894
A small town called
"kiss my ass."

137
00:07:33,563 --> 00:07:35,697
Okay.

138
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,267
But...

139
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:42,637
You sure were giving off
a different vibe in the car.

140
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,876
Good. You're back.
Let's do this.

141
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:52,480
Vamp was last seen
by an ATM camera

142
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:53,915
checking into this hotel.

143
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:56,418
I tapped into the hotel's
security cams and found him.

144
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,586
Room 215.

145
00:07:58,588 --> 00:07:59,921
Okay.

146
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:03,691
Let's do this.

147
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,493
You transmitting?

148
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:07,862
You bet.

149
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:11,065
He alone?

150
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,266
I can't tell.

151
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:15,669
Hey, how about we start
a new tradition,

152
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:20,741
and before each job, we give
each other good-luck kisses?

153
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:24,011
How about I punch you
in the throat instead?

154
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:42,363
You know you're not gonna
get anywhere with Krissy

155
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:43,531
with those cheesy moves.

156
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:46,635
How about you stop
putting salt in my game

157
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:49,238
<i>and mind</i>
<i>your own business?</i>

158
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,482
Blood?

159
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:30,515
Hey, Krissy.

160
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:32,250
What are you two
doing here?

161
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,085
Saving your bacon,
that's what.

162
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:36,821
Does it look like
my bacon needs saving?

163
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:41,860
Wait. How'd you find me?
I paid cash everywhere.

164
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:44,529
Only two hotels
within a 20-mile radius,

165
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:46,799
and we paid cash, too --
just more.

166
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,535
Freaking clerk.

167
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:51,705
Krissy,
where's your dad?

168
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,407
Dead.

169
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,813
Well, let's do this again,
like, never.

170
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:01,850
Now go. We got this.

171
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:02,885
We who?

172
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:04,620
And got what?

173
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:09,425
A vampire.

174
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:12,161
Sorry. A what?

175
00:10:14,232 --> 00:10:17,634
We're in.
The room's clear.

176
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:20,537
<i>Nobody here but a vic.</i>

177
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:45,831
I got him!

178
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,299
You --

179
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,867
son of a bitch.

180
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:50,569
We need to call an ambulance!
Ambulance is on its way.

181
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:53,171
She's in shock.
I'll stabilize her.

182
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:56,008
We'll leave her here
for the paramedics.

183
00:10:58,011 --> 00:10:59,278
Please!
Don't shoot me!

184
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,345
Don't shoot me!
Please, don't --

185
00:11:03,784 --> 00:11:07,186
Please...
It hurts so bad!

186
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:10,155
How did you drop him
so quickly?

187
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:12,358
Darts filled
with dead man's blood.

188
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,061
Where's the blue van?

189
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:16,328
What blue van?

190
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,699
The blue van
that he was Usain Bolting it to?

191
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:22,502
Never mind.

192
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,204
Wait, stop!

193
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:27,006
This is not your kill.

194
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:28,941
What are
you talking about?

195
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:32,579
Three months ago, this
blood banger snuck into a house

196
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:34,047
and killed three people
in their sleep.

197
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,384
What?!
No! I didn't do that!

198
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:42,056
One was a woman --
never hurt anyone!

199
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:48,162
The other two,
a brother and a sister.

200
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:50,731
I don't know
what you're talking about.

201
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:55,636
I came home from a friend's
house, and I found them.

202
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:00,474
They were my family!

203
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:02,576
This isn't happening.

204
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:05,380
I didn't do anything,
I swear.

205
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:06,648
Please, help me!

206
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:31,345
It's okay.

207
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:33,680
It's over.

208
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:40,254
We need to talk to you
privately.

209
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:49,964
You know this guy?

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,269
Yeah.
We have a past.

211
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:00,741
All right. So, you're
gonna have to catch me up.

212
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:02,243
What --
did your dad, uh --

213
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:03,878
he couldn't quit the life,
could he?

214
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,647
No, he did.

215
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:07,181
For a while,
it was amazing.

216
00:13:07,183 --> 00:13:10,685
We had dinner every night
at a table.

217
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:14,555
We watched TV, went on walks.
Even went to the mall.

218
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:16,424
And then?

219
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:19,360
And then...

220
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:22,731
The past
came a-knockin'.

221
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:25,400
I woke up one morning
and found him dead....

222
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:29,704
...his throat ripped out.

223
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:34,743
Well, I'm sorry.

224
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:37,646
Me too.

225
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:41,016
If it weren't for Josephine
and Aidan,

226
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:43,685
I don't know
how I would have made it.

227
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:46,822
So, they both lost
their families, as well?

228
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:50,860
Yeah, the same vamps
we're hunting together --

229
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,361
a nest.

230
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:55,498
Well, look, I am sorry
to rain on your parade,

231
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,468
but you are way too young
to be doing this.

232
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,137
You're never too young
to kill monsters,

233
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,507
especially the ones
that kill your family.

234
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,509
Hunting isn't all about killing
and revenge.

235
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,478
I thought we had this chat
last time.

236
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,115
Do you have any, uh --

237
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,051
do you have any family
that's still out there?

238
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:17,389
An aunt in Cincinnati.
Why?

239
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:19,491
'Cause you're packing a bag,
and we're taking you there.

240
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:22,061
I think Victor's gonna have
a problem with that.

241
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:23,562
Victor?

242
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:26,965
He took us in,
showed us everything we know.

243
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,268
Wait. So,
what are we talking here?

244
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,737
Some sort of kid's school
for hunters?

245
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:35,641
Don't be such a dweeb, okay?
We're not the X-Men.

246
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,743
Victor's helping us
get revenge.

247
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:39,445
Yeah, well, I don't care
what he is. He sucks.

248
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:41,247
'Cause you and your little crew
here got caught.

249
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:42,648
And if it wasn't for me,

250
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,283
your faces would be splattered
all over the news.

251
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:45,418
Well, you know,
so what?!

252
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,087
Maybe it's time
that people know the truth

253
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:48,788
about what's really going bump
in the night.

254
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,557
Oh, and cause panic?
Create mayhem?

255
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,025
Yeah,
that's a <i>great</i> plan.

256
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:55,662
Look, I don't need you
to save me, Dean.

257
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:58,699
I'm not a little kid
anymore.

258
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:03,104
Wow.

259
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:08,109
What happened?

260
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:09,710
Teenagers, that's what.

261
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:12,914
She tell you about Victor?
Yeah. What do we think?

262
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,482
Well, didn't we meet up
with a hunter named Victor

263
00:15:14,484 --> 00:15:15,550
one time in Spokane?

264
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:18,253
That's a long time ago.

265
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:21,055
I haven't heard
about him since.

266
00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:23,391
All right,
so, these kids are --

267
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:25,960
Dangerous and off their meds?
Yeah, no kidding.

268
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:28,763
So, what?
We go and talk with Victor?

269
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,466
Ready?

270
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:34,635
Okay.

271
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,259
Not what I'd call
a compound.

272
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:19,446
Huh.

273
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:21,281
What's wrong?

274
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:22,849
It's just not
what I expected.

275
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,785
And what was that?

276
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:26,686
A little more
"Lord of the Flies",

277
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:27,954
less Huxtables.

278
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:30,990
Sorry to disappoint.

279
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:33,826
Victor Rogers.

280
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:36,429
We met -- a Rugaru hunt
in Washington.

281
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:37,697
I'm Sam. This is Dean.

282
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:39,398
Oh, yes.
The Winchesters.

283
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,933
Right.

284
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,470
Hey.

285
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:46,972
Ohh.

286
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:50,175
Better now?
Much.

287
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,543
And what do
we always say?

288
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:54,046
Move on,
but never forget.

289
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:57,749
Good. Now, don't you have
a trig test in the morning?

290
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,752
Oh, I'm good, Vic.
No test.

291
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,875
I'm just gonna chill,
Uh-huh.

292
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:03,622
play video games.

293
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:04,755
Yeah, keep dreaming.

294
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,956
Because I asked you to clean
your room twice,

295
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,192
and you
still haven't done it.

296
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,360
Go on.

297
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,029
And you.

298
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,566
A full report about the hunt
on your desk by morning.

299
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,635
Okay.
I'll be in my room.

300
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,872
Drink?

301
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,175
Sure.

302
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,644
So,
these kids go to school --

303
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,513
like, school-school,
real school?

304
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,350
Yes, and they're doing
incredibly well

305
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,319
considering
all they've been through.

306
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,220
Okay,
so how does this work?

307
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,523
What, after --
after soccer practice

308
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:39,857
and --
and the bake sale,

309
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,926
they, uh,
chop vampires' heads off?

310
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,394
Well, yeah.

311
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,830
I think a balanced approach
is best, don't you?

312
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,432
But they're kids.

313
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,100
They shouldn't be hunting
at all.

314
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,236
You got to break this up
right now.

315
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:56,006
When I found them,
they were lost, confused, angry.

316
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,575
I gave them family
and purpose.

317
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,711
And you want to
take all that away? Why?

318
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,013
So they
don't get killed.

319
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:06,815
They know the risks.

320
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:08,851
Yeah,
but why take them?

321
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:10,853
Because the next generation
of hunters has to be better.

322
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:11,954
Better than what?

323
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:14,757
Better than us.

324
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,092
Oh, come on, guys.

325
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:20,929
I know your friends.
I mean, Martin was insane.

326
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:22,664
And somebody obviously dropped
Garth on his head

327
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,900
when he was a baby.

328
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,201
And I know you two loved
that Bobby guy,

329
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:28,003
but he was
a barely functional alcoholic.

330
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:29,171
Watch it.

331
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:32,340
No disrespect meant,
but Josephine is

332
00:18:32,342 --> 00:18:35,143
an all-state athlete
and National Merit scholar.

333
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:36,645
Aidan is so fast
he could pick your pocket

334
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:37,779
before you could
even blink.

335
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:40,248
And Krissy,

336
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,117
oh she's just a natural-born
leader and hunter.

337
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,885
So what?

338
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:45,920
So these kids are
the cream of the crop.

339
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:48,723
They are the Beatles.
They are the dream team.

340
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:50,925
And once they get
their revenge...

341
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:55,663
...they'll be better hunters
than any of us ever dreamed of.

342
00:18:58,566 --> 00:19:02,068
This is crazy.

343
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,671
Is it?
They got a pretty good life.

344
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:06,239
Kids aren't
supposed to hunt, Sam.

345
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:07,273
We did.

346
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:08,608
Yeah, and look
what that did for us.

347
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,709
Well, maybe
they're doing it right.

348
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:11,344
Maybe they can hunt
and have a real life.

349
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:12,512
You know
that's not true.

350
00:19:12,514 --> 00:19:13,913
Why, 'cause it didn't work
for us?

351
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:15,348
Because it doesn't work
for anybody.

352
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,250
Okay, then what
do you want to do?

353
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:19,285
'Cause Victor's
not gonna stop this.

354
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:21,275
They said they were hunting
a nest, right?

355
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,790
Yeah.

356
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,291
Well,
let's hunt it for 'em.

357
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:25,659
Well, that way,
until we can figure out

358
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:27,261
what to do with Victor,
they stay safe.

359
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:30,532
All right, um...

360
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:31,833
So, what's your move?

361
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:34,536
I want to talk to that girl
who was tied up at the hotel.

362
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,572
Something didn't smell right
about that.

363
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:38,735
Why don't you stay here
and look after the Brady Bunch?

364
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,336
Sam, just in time.

365
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:25,396
Grab a seat.
Waffles?

366
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:26,960
Yeah, Krissy's fav.

367
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:29,483
My dad used to make 'em for me
all the time.

368
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:31,543
I think it was the only thing
he knew how to cook.

369
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:37,922
Interact.

370
00:20:37,924 --> 00:20:39,182
Yeah, nerd.

371
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:41,075
And you -- manners.

372
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:44,098
We're gonna be late.

373
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,852
Come on.

374
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:50,783
Grab your stuff.

375
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:53,839
I'll pick you up after school.
See ya.

376
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:55,999
Wow.

377
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:57,492
Whirlwind, right?
Yeah.

378
00:20:57,494 --> 00:20:59,223
It's always like that
with kids.

379
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,549
You got any?

380
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,979
Me? Uh, no.

381
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:03,605
You want any?

382
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:06,199
Uh, I don't know.

383
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:12,674
Trust me,
the answer's yes.

384
00:21:12,676 --> 00:21:14,267
These yours?

385
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:16,394
Yeah.

386
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:18,354
Well,
until we went camping

387
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:21,210
and a Wendigo ripped them
to shreds.

388
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:26,097
Sorry.

389
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:30,780
Is that why you're doing this,
taking all these kids in?

390
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:36,627
But you know what I realized,
Sam, is that these kids,

391
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,957
they don't have to live it
the way we have.

392
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,947
You know, crappy hotel rooms,
always moving,

393
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:45,098
no family, no life.

394
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,623
It's not the only way.

395
00:21:50,547 --> 00:21:53,201
Like I told the cops already,

396
00:21:53,203 --> 00:21:55,195
I'm not sure why Jimmy Day
would do something like this.

397
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:56,324
Jimmy Day?

398
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:58,384
Wait, so you knew the guy
that grabbed you?

399
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:03,367
Everyone in town knows Jimmy.
He's a hero.

400
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:04,730
We had a parade for him
downtown

401
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:07,420
when he came back
from Afghanistan.

402
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:10,643
Uh, sorry.
When was this?

403
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:12,636
A few weeks ago.

404
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:16,790
So, uh...
this Jimmy Day guy,

405
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,683
he -- he just grabbed you
and took you to the hotel?

406
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:19,976
No.

407
00:22:19,978 --> 00:22:22,336
I-I came from work
and was in the parking lot

408
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:24,029
when this blue van
pulled up.

409
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:25,923
This guy with a hoodie
asked me directions.

410
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,644
That's all I remember,
till I woke up tied to that bed.

411
00:22:30,646 --> 00:22:32,070
And was hoodie there,
too?

412
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:37,798
Just Jimmy, and he was crying,
saying he was sorry and all.

413
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,591
That he was sorry?

414
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:41,885
At first I thought
he was gonna kill me.

415
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:46,802
But then he just...
he just seemed scared.

416
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:03,781
Hey.
What happened to school?

417
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,475
Victor pulled us out.

418
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:06,572
Why?

419
00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:08,566
'Cause we've found
another target.

420
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:10,393
Who?

421
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:12,823
The vamp that killed
Krissy's dad.

422
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:15,699
You ready?

423
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:21,676
Okay.

424
00:23:21,678 --> 00:23:25,947
Pulled this from a security
camera at a nearby gas station.

425
00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:28,016
Wait, how do we know
this is definitely her?

426
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:32,921
Police sketch,
victim's accounts...

427
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,725
...and this.

428
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:44,765
My dad's necklace.

429
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:52,039
My mom gave it to him
on their anniversary.

430
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,513
Are you sure this is
a video surveillance pic?

431
00:23:59,515 --> 00:24:00,881
It's her!

432
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,688
Excuse me.

433
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:10,265
Hey. You there?

434
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,970
Yeah. How did it go
with the girl?

435
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:15,141
Strange. Might be
that vampire wasn't lying.

436
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:17,043
He was fresh made
within the month,

437
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:20,112
but Josephine's family
was murdered three months ago.

438
00:24:20,114 --> 00:24:21,547
So, who killed them,
then?

439
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:22,782
I don't know.

440
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,351
I'd like to talk to whoever's
driving that blue van.

441
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:27,520
Other than that...You?

442
00:24:27,522 --> 00:24:28,555
Something's up.

443
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:30,090
Victor says he has
a surveillance photo

444
00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:32,025
of the vampire that killed
Krissy's father.

445
00:24:32,027 --> 00:24:35,061
But, Dean...
I'm not so sure.

446
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:36,196
Why's that?

447
00:24:36,198 --> 00:24:37,731
There's no time stamp
on it.

448
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:40,099
Okay.
So you think he's lying?

449
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:42,769
Well, that, or he's just wrong.
It's hard to say.

450
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:44,904
Yeah, I never trust a guy
who wears a sweater.

451
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:47,041
You want me to head
back there?

452
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:48,707
No, no. I'm good.
Let me do some more digging.

453
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:51,510
All right. I'm gonna talk to the
hotel clerk, see what he knows.

454
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:08,526
Hey.
Where did everybody go?

455
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:09,861
Tracking that vamp.

456
00:25:09,863 --> 00:25:12,297
Well, I think we got a problem
a lot closer to home.

457
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,666
Look at this.

458
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:16,902
See that blue van?

459
00:25:16,904 --> 00:25:19,438
My brother saw it
outside the hotel yesterday.

460
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,673
We think he's working
with the vampire we popped.

461
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:25,277
Looks like
we're going huntin'.

462
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:29,949
Ahh.
Nice to see <i>you</i> again.

463
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:31,583
Yeah, I bet.
Listen, I need to know

464
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:34,953
who, uh, checked
into room 215 yesterday.

465
00:25:36,723 --> 00:25:38,324
215.

466
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:39,692
It was some guy
wearing a hoodie,

467
00:25:39,694 --> 00:25:41,094
so it was hard
to make out his face.

468
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:42,862
He drive a blue van,
by any chance?

469
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:44,864
Do I look
like a valet?

470
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,869
He took one of those.

471
00:25:52,606 --> 00:25:54,474
Which one?

472
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:57,076
The one that says "lodge"
on it.

473
00:25:58,112 --> 00:26:01,915
"Conway Springs Lodge."

474
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:03,917
Yep, big during
the summer season.

475
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,485
But this time of year,
it's closed.

476
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:06,853
How far away is it
from here?

477
00:26:06,855 --> 00:26:08,889
Oh, it's a couple miles
down the road.

478
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,042
Hey!

479
00:27:32,044 --> 00:27:33,410
Who the hell are you?!

480
00:27:34,846 --> 00:27:36,346
Answer me!

481
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:38,682
Please make it go away.

482
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:39,683
It hurts so much.

483
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:42,287
What? Wha...

484
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,157
No, shut them off!
They're too bright!

485
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,393
Not till you tell me
what the hell's going on here.

486
00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:49,695
I don't know!

487
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:51,063
Aah!

488
00:27:51,065 --> 00:27:53,566
What's happening to me?

489
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:56,035
Come here.

490
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:57,337
That's never happened
to you before?

491
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:59,505
No. No, there's
something wrong with me.

492
00:27:59,507 --> 00:28:01,540
That -- that guy,
he did something to me.

493
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:03,009
What guy?
I don't know!

494
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:05,044
This guy in a blue van,
he -- he grabbed me.

495
00:28:05,046 --> 00:28:06,078
He took me here.

496
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,648
Oh, my stomach.

497
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,216
It hurts so much.

498
00:28:10,218 --> 00:28:12,618
Dean!

499
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,810
Put those away,
and we can talk.

500
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:29,983
Why are you with the vampire
that killed my dad?

501
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:31,985
You're barking
up the wrong tree.

502
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:34,254
She didn't
kill your pops.

503
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:38,825
I don't want to hurt you, Dean,
but I will if you don't move.

504
00:29:40,228 --> 00:29:43,363
Listen to me, Krissy.

505
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,165
She's innocent.

506
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:50,470
And how would
you know that?

507
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:53,640
Because she's fresh made,
a day or two.

508
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:55,776
Her dad was killed
months ago.

509
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:58,445
This whole thing stinks.

510
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:02,115
That vamp
that we killed last night?

511
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:03,917
Why was he swearing
that he didn't do it?

512
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,151
Because he was a liar.

513
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:09,756
Vampires don't beg
for their lives. They attack.

514
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:12,359
Look, last time
I'm gonna ask you nicely.

515
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:14,494
Take the damn guns off me,
or somebody's gonna get hurt.

516
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:15,629
Big talk.

517
00:30:15,631 --> 00:30:17,364
I know.
It is, isn't it?

518
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:26,507
So, let's say this isn't
the vamp who killed my dad.

519
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:30,378
She's still a monster
and deserves to die.

520
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,414
Not if we can save her.

521
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,415
What?

522
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,918
She hasn't fed yet.

523
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,354
We can reverse this if we find
her maker and get his blood.

524
00:30:39,356 --> 00:30:40,822
And why should we care
about her?

525
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:46,527
Like I said, hunting
isn't always about killing.

526
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:47,762
Oh, please.

527
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,664
Preach to some other choir.
We're not buying it.

528
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:51,533
You want to kill
an innocent girl?!

529
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:57,239
I want the blood sucker
who killed my dad to pay.

530
00:30:57,241 --> 00:31:00,776
And we're gonna find out
who that is.

531
00:31:00,778 --> 00:31:04,079
But let's not be so bloodthirsty
that just anyone will do.

532
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:05,948
But Victor says it's her.

533
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,115
And I say it ain't!

534
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:09,084
So we're gonna pack her
to go,

535
00:31:09,086 --> 00:31:10,819
and we're gonna ask Victor
ourselves.

536
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:12,120
Okay?

537
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,938
You're awake. Good.

538
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,940
We don't have much time.

539
00:31:31,942 --> 00:31:34,009
For what?

540
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:35,944
Picture this.

541
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:42,217
The kids arrive home
victorious,

542
00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:46,488
only to find you dead
in their living room.

543
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,193
It seems that nest of vampires
they were hunting

544
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:52,561
were seeking revenge...

545
00:31:54,797 --> 00:31:57,732
...and killed you.

546
00:31:57,734 --> 00:32:01,068
Thus, inspiring them
to hunt even more.

547
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:03,370
I'm sorry, Sam.

548
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:05,939
I can't have anyone poisoning
my kids' minds.

549
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:07,908
Other than yourself,
that is.

550
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,411
I don't need to justify
my actions to you

551
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:13,080
or your self-righteous ass
of a brother!

552
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:19,120
You mean like why you're working
with a vampire?

553
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:23,792
So what's he get out of this?
Free roaming rights?

554
00:32:23,794 --> 00:32:28,296
We are at war --
a war that we are losing.

555
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:33,102
That Leviathan fiasco
was a wake-up call.

556
00:32:33,104 --> 00:32:37,807
We have to do what we can
to survive.

557
00:32:38,976 --> 00:32:44,180
But I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

558
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:45,515
You're not a father.

559
00:32:45,517 --> 00:32:47,850
You don't know
what it's like

560
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:53,356
to hear the cries
of your children dying.

561
00:32:54,491 --> 00:33:00,029
But now I have a second chance
to make it all right,

562
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:02,131
to create the next generation
of hunters --

563
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:05,836
stronger, faster, smarter.

564
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:09,039
Hey, we're home.

565
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,752
What is going on here?

566
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:24,056
These two
are not to be trusted.

567
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:25,858
They're
trying to destroy us.

568
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,362
Do you know this vamp,
Victor?

569
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:33,165
Of course he does!
They're working together!

570
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,567
Is that true?

571
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,841
It's complicated.

572
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:45,844
No, actually,
it's not.

573
00:33:45,846 --> 00:33:48,547
See, blue van here's been
turning fresh vamps

574
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:50,048
and setting them up
for you kids as easy kills.

575
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,284
But why?

576
00:33:53,452 --> 00:33:58,690
Because they didn't kill
our families, did they?

577
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,594
No.

578
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:05,130
Well, then who did?

579
00:34:05,132 --> 00:34:07,033
I did.

580
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:08,300
And they all screamed...

581
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:13,472
...and begged for mercy,
especially the little ones.

582
00:34:13,474 --> 00:34:15,774
Enough, Seth!

583
00:34:15,776 --> 00:34:18,877
You have to understand.

584
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,847
I saw a way
to make the future better.

585
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:24,616
But to get there,
I had to do something hard.

586
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:28,820
He killed them
off your orders?

587
00:34:28,822 --> 00:34:30,422
You needed motivation.

588
00:34:30,424 --> 00:34:32,124
I scouted
each and every one of you.

589
00:34:33,426 --> 00:34:35,494
And knew it was the only way
to get you to hunt.

590
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:37,629
So you killed our families?

591
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:41,667
I know
the deaths are tragic.

592
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:45,537
But think
of all the future lives

593
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:48,306
that will now be saved
because you are now together.

594
00:34:48,308 --> 00:34:51,109
So, these fake vampires were
just a way for you to train us

595
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:52,878
and fill our heads
with lies?!

596
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,980
Don't you see?

597
00:34:54,982 --> 00:34:57,249
This is bigger
than all of us.

598
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:03,355
We have to learn
to put things in perspective.

599
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,291
Come with me.

600
00:35:06,293 --> 00:35:09,260
We can get past this.

601
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:22,773
That is unfortunate.

602
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:25,776
Aidan!

603
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,347
We're leaving.

604
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:30,681
That's not happening.

605
00:35:30,683 --> 00:35:32,816
I taught you
everything you know.

606
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:36,220
Don't make me hurt you.

607
00:35:36,222 --> 00:35:39,289
Not everything, Victor.

608
00:35:50,702 --> 00:35:53,437
Krissy, don't.

609
00:35:56,341 --> 00:35:58,576
If we want revenge
for our families' deaths,

610
00:35:58,578 --> 00:36:00,045
he gives it to us!

611
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:01,813
We don't kill people.

612
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:05,350
<i>You</i> don't kill people.

613
00:36:05,352 --> 00:36:08,820
He's not a person.
He's a monster.

614
00:36:10,356 --> 00:36:12,424
Krissy, this ends bad,
no matter what we do.

615
00:36:12,426 --> 00:36:14,526
Exactly.

616
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:21,632
Krissy, don't.

617
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:27,939
This is for my dad.

618
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,876
For Josephine's family.

619
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:34,212
For Aidan.

620
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:35,914
For me.

621
00:36:49,862 --> 00:36:52,330
So, we're just
gonna let him live?

622
00:36:52,332 --> 00:36:53,999
Yeah.

623
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:57,736
All alone, with himself.

624
00:36:57,738 --> 00:37:00,806
No family. No friends.

625
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:03,675
Ask me,
that's not much of anything.

626
00:37:08,015 --> 00:37:10,715
Let's save that girl.

627
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:18,790
Gun!

628
00:37:38,597 --> 00:37:39,898
Just drink slowly.

629
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,767
This will take away
all the pain.

630
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,477
Proud of you.

631
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:53,378
Shut up,
before I punch you.

632
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:56,513
So, how's she doing?

633
00:37:56,515 --> 00:37:58,515
Better now.

634
00:37:58,517 --> 00:38:01,084
Oh, um...

635
00:38:04,255 --> 00:38:05,790
I think this is yours.

636
00:38:09,928 --> 00:38:11,462
Thank you.

637
00:38:11,464 --> 00:38:15,299
I'll wait outside.

638
00:38:18,304 --> 00:38:20,305
Okay.

639
00:38:20,307 --> 00:38:22,107
Whenever you're ready,
we'll be in the car.

640
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:23,975
What are
you talking about?

641
00:38:23,977 --> 00:38:26,978
Your aunt? Cincinnati?
Normal life?

642
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,314
We'll be there
by lunch tomorrow.

643
00:38:29,316 --> 00:38:33,251
Look, I hate how
we were put together, but...

644
00:38:33,253 --> 00:38:35,320
I can't deny
that it feels right.

645
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:37,990
And why should I let Victor
ruin that, too?

646
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:39,659
So,
what you're saying is that

647
00:38:39,661 --> 00:38:42,128
you like that boy over there
and you want to stay?

648
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,730
What? Aidan? No.

649
00:38:44,732 --> 00:38:48,600
I mean...
He's like my brother.

650
00:38:48,602 --> 00:38:51,136
It's nothing like that.

651
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:54,506
Well,
you're all still minors.

652
00:38:54,508 --> 00:38:55,674
Not for long.

653
00:38:55,676 --> 00:38:57,576
Josephine will be 18
in a few months.

654
00:38:57,578 --> 00:38:59,744
And we all have a life
and each other here.

655
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:01,546
And hunting?

656
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,881
We won't go looking
for it.

657
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:07,151
But if any monsters show up
around here,

658
00:39:07,153 --> 00:39:09,487
they better look out.

659
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:14,792
Okay. Good.

660
00:39:14,794 --> 00:39:16,294
Really?

661
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:19,030
I thought I was gonna have to
fight you way more on that.

662
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:21,599
Well, you're right.
You're not a kid anymore.

663
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:23,568
You can make
your own decisions.

664
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:27,138
You're all right
for an old guy.

665
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,606
I'm really
not that old.

666
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:31,342
You keep
telling yourself that.

667
00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:32,510
Huh.

668
00:39:32,512 --> 00:39:33,811
All right.

669
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:35,813
Well, I'm gonna have a, uh --
a guy come and check on you

670
00:39:35,815 --> 00:39:36,814
every once in a while,
okay?

671
00:39:36,816 --> 00:39:38,216
His name is Garth.

672
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:40,284
He'll make sure that you're all
right and you got what you need.

673
00:39:40,286 --> 00:39:42,120
Garth?
Yeah.

674
00:39:42,122 --> 00:39:44,589
He's a little strange at first,
but you'll come to love him.

675
00:39:51,297 --> 00:39:54,099
Take care, Dean.

676
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:03,507
Yeah. Goodbye, Dean.

677
00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:05,910
Aidan.

678
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,214
Listen, there's, uh,

679
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:11,715
something I want to tell you
about Krissy.

680
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:12,816
I know. I know.

681
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:14,685
You'll kill me
if I ever hurt her.

682
00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:15,619
Blah. Blah. Blah.

683
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:19,423
No, no. No.
<i>She'll</i> kill you.

684
00:40:22,827 --> 00:40:25,829
Good luck.

685
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,506
This is good.

686
00:40:35,508 --> 00:40:36,907
Is it?

687
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:39,115
Could have been
a lot worse.

688
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:41,117
Will be if we don't shut
those Gates of Hell soon.

689
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,520
What do they have to do
with any of that?

690
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:45,455
They're hunters now.

691
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:47,791
You don't just walk away
from that.

692
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,025
There's only one way
out of that,

693
00:40:49,027 --> 00:40:50,594
and you and I both know
it ain't pretty.

694
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:53,430
Maybe
they'll be different.

695
00:40:53,432 --> 00:40:56,734
Or maybe if we shut that
hell hole once and for and all,

696
00:40:56,736 --> 00:40:58,636
those three
can have a real life.

697
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:04,942
Maybe they won't be
the only ones.

698
