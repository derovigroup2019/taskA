1
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:04,330
I don't hunt anymore.

2
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:05,565
- You quit?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:08,000
What could possibly
make you stop just like that?

4
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:10,236
Was there a girl?

5
00:00:10,238 --> 00:00:12,271
Yeah. There was.

6
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:13,506
And then there wasn't.

7
00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:15,941
You need to know,
I didn't just drop out.

8
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:16,942
I found something.

9
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:19,078
- Yeah, what was her name?
- Amelia.

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,447
Professor morrison,
your government needs you, sir.

11
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,082
My God,
where'd you find this guy?

12
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:25,084
Supposed to be a top expert
in his field.

13
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:26,586
- Wait, there's another tablet?
- Yes.

14
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:27,755
So another word of God?

15
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:28,956
How many words of God
are there?

16
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,825
I just became a Prophet,
like, a year ago.

17
00:00:30,827 --> 00:00:33,161
Well, did this tablet have a name?
"Demons."

18
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:36,097
What about demons?
As far as I could tell...

19
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:37,599
everything.

20
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,670
Kevin!

21
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:44,040
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Hey. What's it say?

22
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:45,976
Since we lost the tablet,
Kevin figures we don't need him.

23
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:47,478
Yeah,
but Crowley still does.

24
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,379
What's that kid thinking?!

25
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,980
He was
our responsibility.

26
00:00:49,982 --> 00:00:51,582
Let's find him.
Okay.

27
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,051
Aah!

28
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:10,002
Congratulations.
You're fast.

29
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:13,204
I do a lot of cardio.

30
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:24,714

Original Air Date on October 17, 2012

31
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:28,739
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

32
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,291
Wow.

33
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:34,026
Guy goes to Purgatory for
a year, all hell breaks loose.

34
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,227
Check this out.

35
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:38,530
A jogger in Minneapolis
gets his heart ripped out.

36
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:39,564
I'm guessing literally?

37
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,099
Only way
that interests me.

38
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,568
And then, there's another
article from six months ago.

39
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,237
Same thing happens,
also in Minneapolis.

40
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,639
What does that tell us?

41
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:49,374
Stay out of Minneapolis.

42
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:53,078
Two hearts ganked, same city,
six months apart.

43
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,314
I mean, that's got to be
a ritual, man.

44
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:56,648
Or at least some sort of

45
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,785
a heart-sucking, possessed,
satanic, crack-whore bat.

46
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:01,086
A what?

47
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:02,254
It's a case.

48
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:04,723
Look, I say we hang out
the shingle again and ride.

49
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:05,724
We're on a case, Dean.

50
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:07,827
Kevin and the demon tablet
need to be found,

51
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:09,362
so heart guy
takes a number.

52
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:11,464
Uh, we just spent a week
chasing our asses

53
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:13,265
trying to lock Kevin down,
okay?

54
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:15,534
And look at us. We're --

55
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:18,137
where the hell are we?

56
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,873
Farmers' market.

57
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,775
Organic.

58
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,344
What?
I had a year off.

59
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:27,012
I took the time
to enjoy the good things.

60
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:29,381
While avoiding doing
what we actually do.

61
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,417
Wow, Dean, does it make you feel
that much better

62
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,351
every time you say it?

63
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:34,120
All right, man,
look, I get it.

64
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:37,089
You took a year off to do yoga
and play the lute, whatever,

65
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,124
but I'm back.

66
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:39,558
Okay, we're back,
which means that we walk

67
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,293
and kill monsters
at the same time.

68
00:03:41,295 --> 00:03:42,494
We'll find Kevin.

69
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:44,997
But in the meantime,
do we ignore stuff like this?

70
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,598
Or are innocent people
supposed to die

71
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,534
so that you can shop
for produce?

72
00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:56,675
Here's what's odd
about this thing --

73
00:03:56,677 --> 00:03:58,811
the guy wasn't chopped
or cut into, no incision.

74
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:01,647
But his heart was ripped
out of him like a peach pit.

75
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:02,682
Was he robbed?

76
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,617
Phone, watch,
money all still on him.

77
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,152
What about enemies?

78
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:08,188
He was in town for a conference.
No local connections.

79
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,457
You guys had another one
of these about six months ago.

80
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,059
Yeah,
and we hit a brick wall.

81
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,195
We had nothing to go on,
really.

82
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:17,099
Thought maybe
we got lucky here.

83
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:20,535
A park surveillance camera
picked up something.

84
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:24,407
Huh.

85
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:26,875
That chubby guy the last person
to see the vic alive?

86
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:27,910
Other than the killer.

87
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:28,777
Name's Paul Hayes.

88
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:30,312
We pulled him in
for questioning.

89
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:31,580
So what makes you think
he's clean?

90
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:32,948
Well, so far,
no reason <i>not</i> to.

91
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,617
I mean, he said he briefly saw
the victim,

92
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:36,652
he ran out ahead,
that was it.

93
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:38,187
What, you mean
he didn't fall to his knees

94
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:39,488
and confess
to gutting the guy?

95
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,790
No. I mean we did
a thorough check on the guy,

96
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,859
not so much
as a parking ticket came up.

97
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:45,193
I mean, look at him.

98
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:48,830
I mean, sure, he can run
a little bit, but Thor he ain't.

99
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,766
You think he's gonna grab
Freddy fitness here

100
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:52,801
and throw him down
and rip out his heart?

101
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:54,636
I don't think so.

102
00:04:54,638 --> 00:04:57,072
Forgive me if I didn't take him
out back and shoot him.

103
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,979
Okay, uh
so...

104
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:06,983
...any idea where we can find
this guy?

105
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:18,093
Sorry.

106
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:21,529
I kind of try to stick to a
nutrition and workout schedule.

107
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:22,831
Do you want a hit?

108
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,199
I'm good. Thanks.

109
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,400
Oh.

110
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:30,738
So, Paul, you passed a runner
who was later killed.

111
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,206
Did you speak with him
at all?

112
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,808
Yeah, I went over this
with the cops.

113
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,042
I-I didn't know him.

114
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,911
I had never spoken to him.

115
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:42,013
I ran past him.
I never saw him again. The end.

116
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:46,950
Mm, oh.
It's disgusting.

117
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:49,653
It tastes like crap,
but it keeps you young.

118
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:52,288
Thanks, uh -- uh...
Too much fiber.

119
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,322
No such thing.

120
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:54,757
Thank you.

121
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,791
See?

122
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:58,293
Now, Paul,
we couldn't help but notice

123
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:01,664
that the jogger you outraced was
a good deal younger than you.

124
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,233
Yeah, and less, uh...

125
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:06,802
Uh, full-figured?
You should've seen me before.

126
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:09,137
Yeah, hugging a desk all day
and watching TV all night,

127
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,141
eating fried everything
was killing me.

128
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:14,743
I had a health scare
about a year ago.

129
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:15,744
I'm sorry to hear that.

130
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:17,045
No,
it changed my life.

131
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:19,013
I mean, I started taking care
of myself.

132
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:20,214
Now your body's a temple,
huh?

133
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:23,183
Where I worship every day.

134
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,288
Ah.

135
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,892
All right,
so...What's the word?

136
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,760
What did you find
poking around at Paul's?

137
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,563
Ah, just the usual --
condoms, hair gel.

138
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:40,333
No hex bags, nothing satanic,
nothing spooky.

139
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:42,167
So,
he didn't seem like a guy

140
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,836
who would be voted
most likely to disembowel?

141
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:45,971
No, they never do.

142
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,908
Wait a minute.
Here's another one.

143
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,309
What, murder?

144
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,044
And a do-it-yourself
heart bypass.

145
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,145
Two days after this one.

146
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,380
What part of Minneapolis?

147
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,883
The Iowa part. Ames.

148
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,884
Well, Paul was here
being questioned.

149
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:02,952
There's no way
that could have been him.

150
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:05,054
This guy was a cop.

151
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:07,790
This is exactly what happened
six months ago.

152
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,326
Minneapolis, then Ames.

153
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:13,128
Guess you missed that one.

154
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,996
I'm just saying.

155
00:07:14,998 --> 00:07:18,800
Arthur Swenson.
Real top-shelf officer.

156
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:21,035
20 years on the force.

157
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:23,938
He'd ordered a pizza,
which the vic delivered.

158
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,006
And then?

159
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:27,141
The vic didn't make
his next drop-off.

160
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:30,244
His body was found on the walk
in front of Swenson's.

161
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:32,213
And he wasn't wearing a heart?
No.

162
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:33,180
Heartless.

163
00:07:33,182 --> 00:07:36,417
And, uh,
what about Swenson?

164
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,085
Crumpled on the front stoop.

165
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:40,722
Covered in blood,
crying like a baby.

166
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,027
Ironically, he had been in court
all week, testifying.

167
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,795
Hey, Levitt, line two.

168
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:49,163
Excuse me.

169
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:51,532
Go ahead.

170
00:07:51,534 --> 00:07:53,701
So that couldn't have been him
in Minneapolis.

171
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:57,103
I hate
when this happens.

172
00:07:57,105 --> 00:07:59,605
So, this Arthur guy,
what does --

173
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:01,274
what does he have to say?

174
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:02,708
Uh...

175
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,510
it's not real helpful.

176
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:15,220
So,
you getting his statement?

177
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:18,557
Uh, yeah, k-kind of.

178
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,893
Probably not.

179
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:25,264
It's too bad I dropped out
of Lunatic 101.

180
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:28,968
Whatever it is, it sounds like
he's repeating it.

181
00:08:32,906 --> 00:08:34,406
Look at his eyes.

182
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,346
Hey, Arthur...

183
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:43,515
Did you do this alone?

184
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:49,855
Arthur, did some invisible voice
tell you you had to kill?

185
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:51,356
K'uhul ajaw, Cacao,
shi-jiiy!

186
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:56,262
Oh,
now you've pissed him off.

187
00:08:56,264 --> 00:08:57,897
Hey, Art.
Can I call you Art?

188
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,768
Listen, I'm gonna sprinkle
your arm with holy water,

189
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,071
and it's gonna steam and burn
if you're possessed by a demon.

190
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:12,245
He's a mushroom.

191
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,784
Okay, not possessed.

192
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:20,419
Arthur, you want to tell us
why you did this?

193
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:21,620
K'uhul ajaw, Cacao,
shi-jiiy.

194
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:23,255
K'uhul ajaw, Cacao,
shi-jiiy.

195
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:24,857
K'uhul ajaw, Cacao,
shi-jiiy.

196
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:28,060
Okay.

197
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,477
Aah!

198
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,217
So, what do you think?

199
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:34,095
Personally, I prefer
the Keith Richards version.

200
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:37,355
Can you actually understand
any of the words?

201
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:38,523
If they <i>are</i> words.

202
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:41,159
Sounds like babble to me.

203
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:43,161
Wait a second.

204
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:44,128
What?

205
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,464
I bought a translation app.

206
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:49,867
You bought an app.

207
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:50,934
Yeah.

208
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,702
Here, play it.

209
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:01,576
Softly repeating "K'uhul ajaw,
<i>Cacao, shi-jiiy" ]</i>

210
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:07,315
And babble wins.
"Language unknown."

211
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:13,254
Mm.

212
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,225
Agent Sambora.

213
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:20,327
What?

214
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:25,800
So, Dr. Kashi,
what are we looking at here,

215
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:27,501
some kind
of psychotic break?

216
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:29,704
Oh, definitely.
He was very thorough.

217
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:30,672
Severed the optic nerve.

218
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:32,708
He was determined
to remove the eye.

219
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,010
And he used,
uh, what to cut with?

220
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:37,077
He doesn't look strong
enough, but he broke off

221
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:39,389
part of the bed frame
and used it as a knife.

222
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:40,849
Thank you.

223
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,284
Wow. They should put
warning labels on those beds.

224
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,053
Like I said --
determined.

225
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:48,288
I noticed that he had
two different-colored eyes.

226
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,023
Yes. Apparently,
he was in an accident

227
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,658
where much of one eye
was shattered.

228
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,460
His vision was saved
with a transplant.

229
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,995
When was this?

230
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:59,933
A year ago,
almost to the date.

231
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:01,167
And, interestingly,

232
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:03,203
it's the transplanted eye
he chose to cut out.

233
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:05,705
Really?

234
00:12:07,374 --> 00:12:09,075
Hey, let me ask you something,
doc.

235
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:11,577
Is it possible to trace the
donor of a transplanted organ?

236
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:12,645
Difficult.

237
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:14,680
But possible?

238
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:18,784
Hmm.

239
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:28,996
- Hey.
- Hey.

240
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,435
Arthur Swenson had an eye
transplant a year ago, right?

241
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:31,900
Yeah.

242
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,434
Well, I remembered
that Paul Hayes

243
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,569
was talking about a health scare
he had a year ago

244
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:36,938
that changed his life,

245
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,408
so I pulled up his medical
records from Minneapolis.

246
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:45,246
You want me on board,
I'm on board.

247
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,914
Anyways, you want to guess
who else,

248
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,650
other than Arthur Swenson, had
a transplant in the last year?

249
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:50,618
Paul Hayes?

250
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,253
I gave it away, didn't I?

251
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:53,821
Okay,
so we've got two suspects

252
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:56,057
in two identical murders
in two different cities

253
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:58,192
that both had organ transplants
a year ago.

254
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,861
Yeah. Also...

255
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,095
I love
when there's an "also."

256
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,630
I got to thinking
about all that stuff

257
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:04,031
Arthur Swenson
was talking about.

258
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,801
Maybe your translation app
called it "language unknown"

259
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:11,639
because it's a dead language,
like ancient Greek or Manx.

260
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:12,840
Manx?

261
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,477
So I e-mailed an audio file
of Arthur's mumbling

262
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,778
to Dr. Morrison.

263
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,574
Who?

264
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,282
Dr. Morrison,
the anthropology Professor

265
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:22,049
who helped us out
with the Amazons.

266
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,252
Yes, okay. Okay.

267
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:26,854
Well, let's get our asses
on the road.

268
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:28,222
Headed to...?

269
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,391
Well, if we are in a repeat
of a cycle from six months ago,

270
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,161
then, after the murders
in Minneapolis and in Ames,

271
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:36,097
the next heart attack
was in Boulder, Colorado.

272
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:03,491
Randa?

273
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:05,994
Chick, right?

274
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:11,633
Loved your performance
tonight.

275
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:15,937
Must take, uh, must take
years of training.

276
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:22,910
Actually, uh...
I'm kind of a natural.

277
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:30,617
Um...

278
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,486
You know, I don't normally do
this kind of thing.

279
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:35,087
Mm-hmm.

280
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:38,224
Um, there's just --

281
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:41,961
just something about you.

282
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,992
All right,
case is coming together.

283
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,594
Things are coming together,
man.

284
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:16,164
You and me.
It is all good.

285
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,936
Hey.

286
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:22,604
What?

287
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:24,739
What are you thinking about,
organic tomatoes?

288
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,875
I'm not thinking
about anything.

289
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:29,444
I don't know about you,

290
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:32,880
but this last year has given me
a new perspective.

291
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:33,910
I hear you. Believe me.

292
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,216
But now I know
where I'm at my best,

293
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:36,884
and that is right here,

294
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:39,854
driving down crazy street
next to you.

295
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,156
Makes sense.

296
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:44,259
Yes, it does.

297
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:46,395
Or...
maybe you don't need me.

298
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,365
I mean,
maybe you're at your best

299
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:50,933
hacking and slicing
your way

300
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:52,668
through
all the world's crap alone,

301
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,904
not having to explain yourself
to anybody.

302
00:15:57,742 --> 00:15:58,842
Yeah, that makes sense,

303
00:15:58,844 --> 00:16:00,477
seeing as I have
so many other brothers

304
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:02,412
I can talk to
about this stuff.

305
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:03,847
Look, I'm not saying
I'm bailing on you.

306
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:05,682
I'm just saying make room
for the possibility

307
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:07,150
that we want
different things.

308
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:09,086
I mean, I want my time
to count for something.

309
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:10,988
So,
what we do doesn't count?

310
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,961
Yeah?

311
00:16:17,963 --> 00:16:20,464
Hey, Dr. Kashi.

312
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:21,432
Okay.

313
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:22,533
Thank you.

314
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:25,602
Uh, could you run
one more name for me?

315
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:28,639
Yeah -- Hayes, Paul.

316
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:30,641
Uh-huh.
And the donor?

317
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:33,611
Seriously?

318
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:36,413
How many others?

319
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:37,848
Did anybody
from Boulder, Colorado,

320
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,751
receive
any of those organs?

321
00:16:40,753 --> 00:16:42,019
Okay, thank you.

322
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:46,656
Well, this is gonna singe
your axons.

323
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:49,492
She says that both
Paul Hayes' kidney

324
00:16:49,494 --> 00:16:52,495
and Arthur Swenson's new eye
came from --

325
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:53,996
you ready for this? --

326
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:55,364
Brick Holmes.

327
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,705
You don't mean
<i>the</i> Brick Holmes.

328
00:16:58,706 --> 00:16:59,202
I do.

329
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:00,769
- The all-pro quarterback?
- Indeed.

330
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,538
Yeah, the guy played
at the top of his game

331
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,006
for like a million years,
didn't he?

332
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:06,008
Yeah, he -- he bought it
in a car crash last year.

333
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,976
Yeah.

334
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:08,778
Nose-dived off a bridge
or something.

335
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,313
He must've signed
a donor card.

336
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:13,415
Did the doctor say
how many organs he donated?

337
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:15,651
Including our two suspects?
Eight.

338
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:17,153
Eight?
Eight.

339
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:19,422
Okay, um, and one of them's
in Boulder, am I right?

340
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:21,123
You would be wrong.
That's the bad news.

341
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,727
Good news is, Brick lived
just outside of Boulder.

342
00:17:24,729 --> 00:17:26,062
Well, Brick's dead.

343
00:17:26,064 --> 00:17:28,664
Yeah, but he's all we got,
so we are going to Boulder.

344
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:40,911
K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy.

345
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:47,752
K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy.

346
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:55,160
K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy.

347
00:17:55,162 --> 00:17:58,929
K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy.

348
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:42,135
I just want to say

349
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:44,069
how sorry we are for your loss,
Mrs. Holmes.

350
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:45,304
Thank you.

351
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:47,005
You know, Brick Holmes was
my idol back in high school.

352
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:49,174
Amazing career.

353
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:52,211
18 pro seasons, 7 division
championships, 4 Super Bowls --

354
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:54,112
never slowed down a day.

355
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:58,450
Brick lived for competition
and athletic perfection.

356
00:18:58,452 --> 00:19:01,220
I don't think it occurred
to his fans that he was human,

357
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:02,755
like the rest of us.

358
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:04,623
Do you know your son was
an organ donor?

359
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:09,361
Does that make this
a matter for the FBI?

360
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:10,929
Like we explained earlier,

361
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:14,500
we're mostly here to dot
some I's on a different matter.

362
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:17,336
There was a public-awareness
thing a few years ago.

363
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:19,505
A lot of star athletes
signed on.

364
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:21,608
I'm sure Brick
didn't think twice about it,

365
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,710
since he never thought
he was going to die.

366
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:26,346
A lot of jocks are like that,
I guess.

367
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:29,249
You know,
I-I can't help wonder

368
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,551
what happened that night
on that bridge.

369
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:34,487
There was light traffic, no
alcohol involved, no skid marks.

370
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:36,956
Big-time athlete,
reflexes like a cat,

371
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,858
how is it that he just drives
off the side of a bridge?

372
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,595
When things happen
that aren't supposed to happen,

373
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:46,165
they're called accidents,
I believe.

374
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,768
So, everybody knows about
Brick's football career, obviously,

375
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,438
but no one knows much
about his personal life.

376
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,572
Was he ever married?

377
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:57,242
Just to the game.
He gave it everything he had.

378
00:19:57,244 --> 00:19:58,944
It's a difficult life.

379
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:01,680
Did you notice any changes
in Brick before he died --

380
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,949
you know, anyone,
anything new in his life?

381
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:06,151
No, no.
I don't think so.

382
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:07,586
So, no new interests?

383
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:10,622
Fly fishing, stamp collecting,
the occult?

384
00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:12,457
The occult?

385
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:14,326
As a "for instance."

386
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:15,760
No.

387
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:18,896
Everything was
just as it had been.

388
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:22,300
I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid my time is up.

389
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:26,036
The university is naming a new
athletic building after Brick.

390
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:27,238
I can't be late.

391
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,207
Of course.
Just one more question.

392
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:32,110
There is always one more
question in life, isn't there?

393
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:35,079
That's what <i>I</i> find.

394
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:36,914
Right.

395
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:41,952
Oh, she didn't want to say much,
did she?

396
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:43,420
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

397
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,289
There it is.
It happened.

398
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,024
Come on, don't tell me someone
had their heart ripped out

399
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:50,394
here in Boulder.
All right, then I won't tell you.

400
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,138
What are you doing here,
Randa?

401
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,875
You know I like to stay close
to the mother ship.

402
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:10,514
I saw a car out front,
so I came in the back.

403
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:12,148
Cops?

404
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:18,054
I suppose Brick's death
continues to fascinate.

405
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:21,157
So we're clear...

406
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:23,693
You're still being very careful
about what you say?

407
00:21:23,695 --> 00:21:26,763
I'm old, Randa,
not an idiot.

408
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:28,731
I'm just trying
to protect Brick.

409
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:30,066
And so am I.

410
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:33,303
Brick's heart beats
inside here now.

411
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:36,839
Brick gave me new life.
I can feel him.

412
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:38,975
It's why I moved
to Boulder...

413
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:41,878
to be near here.

414
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,780
And I'll watch out for you
like Brick did.

415
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:45,582
I don't need
your concern.

416
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:48,986
We need each other,
and Brick needs us.

417
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:52,890
You keep
our little secret safe,

418
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:56,728
and the three of us
will be just fine.

419
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,735
All right, Professor Morrison,
that does it.

420
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:05,738
The FBI thanks you.

421
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,941
Yes,
I am totally looking into

422
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:11,411
adding you
as a technical advisor.

423
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,546
Yeah, I-it comes
with a medical plan.

424
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:15,748
All right, goodbye.

425
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,717
He come through?

426
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,918
Yeah, he did.

427
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,622
All right, so, here's
what crazy Arthur Swenson

428
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:24,591
was babbling over and over.

429
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:28,061
Um, first,
it <i>is</i> a dead language --

430
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,329
ancient Mayan.

431
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:30,897
Doesn't get much deader
than that.

432
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:35,568
So, what Arthur was saying was
"The divine God Cacao is born."

433
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,669
Cacao?

434
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:39,338
Cacao. Yeah,
the Mayan God of maize --

435
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,773
corn, the big crop.

436
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:43,442
See, Cacao was
the most powerful God

437
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:45,510
because maize was the most
important thing to the Mayas.

438
00:22:45,512 --> 00:22:48,313
Well, that and torturing
and killing everyone in sight.

439
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:50,315
So, this is
what we're looking for,

440
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:52,684
is a thousand-year-old
culture's God of corn?

441
00:22:52,686 --> 00:22:54,786
Uh, I guess.

442
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:56,554
Well, whatever it is,
we better cap it quick,

443
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:57,956
or somebody in Phoenix
is next up

444
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:58,990
to get their heart yanked.

445
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:00,925
Someone in Phoenix
got a piece of Brick?

446
00:23:00,927 --> 00:23:02,460
Yeah, I got a name.
Just e-mailed the cops.

447
00:23:02,462 --> 00:23:04,162
Just heard back from them.

448
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:06,431
They haven't seen the guy
in days.

449
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:08,733
Uh, oh,
got another e-mail here, too.

450
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:10,235
This one is for you.

451
00:23:10,237 --> 00:23:11,803
From a university.

452
00:23:11,805 --> 00:23:14,339
Answering questions
about admissions.

453
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:18,209
Just something I'm looking into.
An option.

454
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,878
You're seriously talking about
hanging it up?

455
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,613
I'm not talking about anything,
Dean.

456
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:24,281
I'm just looking
at options.

457
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:27,884
So, what, should we just go
to Phoenix

458
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:30,120
and chase our tails
until this guy shows his face?

459
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:32,522
No. Uh, Brick Holmes
is the way into this.

460
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:35,925
Eleanor Holmes was doing her
damndest not to tell us a thing.

461
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:38,794
Nice job on changing
the subject, though.

462
00:23:44,468 --> 00:23:46,570
All right,
naming ceremony's over at 10:00.

463
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:47,738
We got to get in and out.

464
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,507
Master bedroom.
Yeah.

465
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:55,147
Closets.

466
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:05,825
Brick's closet.

467
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:07,660
Looks like the stuff hasn't
been touched in a year.

468
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:12,364
Man, what this stuff
would go for on eBay.

469
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:18,905
Hey, Sammy,
would it totally crush you

470
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:22,743
to know that your boy Brick
wasn't a natural blond?

471
00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:25,778
Dean, this is really weird.

472
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,046
What do you got?

473
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,916
I don't know.
Is this <i>Eleanor's</i> closet?

474
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:32,485
Why would his mother's closet
be in here? Are you sure?

475
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,090
Check this out.

476
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,262
This is what she was wearing
today when we talked to her.

477
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:44,697
Maybe she moved
into Brick's room after he died.

478
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:51,170
Or...

479
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:54,873
Oh.

480
00:24:57,143 --> 00:24:58,376
Thanks, Dean.

481
00:24:58,378 --> 00:25:01,880
Now that image is permanently
etched into my retinas.

482
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:22,269
That's
what I'm talking about.

483
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:35,015
Wow.

484
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:38,018
I knew he'd have something
like this in his house.

485
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,388
This is a lot of hardware.

486
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,457
Okay, the football trophies
I get,

487
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,991
but there's a lot
of other stuff here --

488
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:47,361
I mean, baseball, boxing,
race-car driving.

489
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:50,297
He was a fan.

490
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,965
Any kind of athlete --
he respected them.

491
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,500
I mean, look at all
the old stuff he's got --

492
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:56,170
a cricket mallet,
golf clubs,

493
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:59,339
a Kendo sword,
archery equipment.

494
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:09,149
Hey, look at this.

495
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:15,688
They're all the same.

496
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,590
"Dearest Betsy..."
Blah blah blah.

497
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:18,691
Who's Betsy?

498
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:20,627
I don't know.
Girlfriend?

499
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,962
Eleanor didn't mention
a Betsy.

500
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:26,867
This one looks old.

501
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:29,970
Uh, "Dearest Betsy,
third day of training camp.

502
00:26:29,972 --> 00:26:32,572
"Roadwork improving.
Working on my left jab.

503
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:35,375
They say this kid Sugar Ray
is gonna be tough."

504
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:36,376
Sugar Ray?

505
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:37,978
As in Robinson?

506
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,913
Didn't he box in, like,
the '40s?

507
00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:41,248
Is it signed the same?

508
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,050
Yeah. "Love, me."

509
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:46,286
Here. "Dearest Betsy,
on the road again.

510
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:48,155
"So hard to be away from you,
honey.

511
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:49,743
Will give the Red Sox hell

512
00:26:49,768 --> 00:26:51,393
and get back to you."
"Dearest Betsy..."

513
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:53,628
"Dearest Betsy, Le Mans will be
a bitch this year with all the rain..."

514
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,430
"...the Phillies are tough,
but we're looking to be tougher..."

515
00:26:55,432 --> 00:26:57,398
"...them Dodgers will wish
they never left Brooklyn..."

516
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,234
"...looking for my best gal
Friday night at the Garden..."

517
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:01,035
"...our o-line hung tough.
I had all day back there..."

518
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,404
"...Alain Prost is a monster
in the straightaway..."

519
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:04,772
"Dearest Betsy..."
"Dearest Betsy..."

520
00:27:04,774 --> 00:27:05,873
"Love, me."

521
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,442
Wait,
this one looks recent.

522
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:11,077
"Dearest Betsy...

523
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,412
So tired of it all."

524
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:20,954
Hey.

525
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:24,057
I pulled up the names
on those trophies. Check it out.

526
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:29,230
All right, Brick Holmes --
football player.

527
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,832
Charlie Karnes --
race-car driver.

528
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:32,701
Davey Samuelson --
baseball player.

529
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:33,669
Kelly Duran -- boxer.

530
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:35,804
Four different guys, right?
Okay.

531
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:37,673
Check this out.

532
00:27:41,746 --> 00:27:44,680
Same dark eyes, same cheekbones,
nose, mouth.

533
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:47,282
Wait, are you saying
that these four guys

534
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:48,984
who all look to be
in their mid-20s

535
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:52,187
and go back 70 years
could be the same guy?

536
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:55,290
Wow.

537
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:58,194
For a 95-year-old,
Brick Holmes could take a hit.

538
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:09,016
So, if all those athletes
were the same guy,

539
00:28:09,018 --> 00:28:10,719
how'd he pull it off?

540
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:14,823
Appear, then go away
and come back with a new look?

541
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:16,592
Cacao, the, uh, the --
the maize God --

542
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,560
was Mayan, right?
Yeah.

543
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:20,996
The Maya were all about war
and torture and conquest...

544
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:22,630
and sports.

545
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:24,732
It says, "Their athletes
were treated like kings.

546
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:27,434
"The Mayan jocks made sacrifices
to Cacao by --"

547
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:28,836
ready for this? --

548
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:31,571
"killing a victim, pulling out
his heart, and eating it."

549
00:28:31,573 --> 00:28:35,075
They believed the rituals
gave them super-charged power

550
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:37,777
over their opponents.

551
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:39,846
Yeah, but they didn't stay young
forever.

552
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:41,347
So, what?

553
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:44,284
Maybe Brick just made some kind
of deal with this Cacao?

554
00:28:44,286 --> 00:28:45,952
Well,
we've seen it before --

555
00:28:45,954 --> 00:28:47,754
people making deals
with demons, Gods.

556
00:28:47,756 --> 00:28:49,622
I mean, maybe he stayed
young and strong

557
00:28:49,624 --> 00:28:51,458
so long as his sacrifices
kept coming.

558
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,160
Remember all that antique
sports equipment he had?

559
00:28:54,162 --> 00:28:56,363
This guy could go back
to the Mayan days.

560
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:57,531
Wow.

561
00:28:57,533 --> 00:29:02,669
So, one of the greatest QBs
to ever play the game

562
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:04,271
was over 900 years old.

563
00:29:04,273 --> 00:29:05,805
Well,
that explains Brick,

564
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:08,241
but what about the mooks
carrying his spare parts?

565
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:10,243
Maybe the spell
went along for the ride

566
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:12,445
and infected the people
who got his organs.

567
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:14,480
Remember how Paul Hayes said

568
00:29:14,482 --> 00:29:16,783
he had a health scare
that changed his life?

569
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:18,551
I mean, maybe the spell
could compel him

570
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:20,019
to keep carrying out
the ritual.

571
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:21,654
Sort of like getting bit
by a werewolf.

572
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:23,923
I mean, once you're infected,
you do what you got to do,

573
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:25,491
especially if you like
the results.

574
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:28,094
Right, except old Arthur,
the dedicated cop,

575
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:30,096
couldn't handle it
and went nuts.

576
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:36,736
Brick Holmes, a heart eater.
Who knew?

577
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:38,204
Hey, sorry, buddy.

578
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:43,209
The mighty --
they fall hard, huh?

579
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:46,111
Well, at least he wasn't
sleeping with his mother.

580
00:29:46,113 --> 00:29:48,714
Yeah, good, Sam.
Find the silver lining.

581
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:51,150
No, seriously. Look.

582
00:29:57,223 --> 00:29:59,124
"Fighter Kelly Duran
is congratulated

583
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:02,227
on a second-round knockout
by wife Betsy."

584
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:05,062
"Dearest Betsy."

585
00:30:10,302 --> 00:30:11,335
Hello, Eleanor.

586
00:30:11,337 --> 00:30:14,906
Or would you rather us
call you Betsy?

587
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:18,677
Look, Eleanor,
innocent people are dying.

588
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,180
And they're gonna continue
to die until we stop it.

589
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,585
Did you know about the murders
over the past year?

590
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:31,424
No. I didn't.
I swear.

591
00:30:31,426 --> 00:30:35,929
I thought when -- when
Brick died, it would be over.

592
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:37,397
Help us.

593
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:41,201
Betsy, this is not what you want
Brick's legacy to be.

594
00:30:44,472 --> 00:30:49,410
His Mayan name was Inyo.

595
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:56,150
He was a proud young athlete
nearly 1,000 years ago.

596
00:30:56,152 --> 00:30:57,784
He lived for sport

597
00:30:57,786 --> 00:31:00,787
and never wanted
his days in the sun to end.

598
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:05,925
So he arranged a bargain
with the God Cacao

599
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:07,126
through a high priest.

600
00:31:07,128 --> 00:31:08,460
Stay young forever.

601
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:12,431
As long as the sacrifices
continued, twice a year --

602
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:15,667
once for the planting,
once for harvest.

603
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:17,636
When did you find out
about this?

604
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:21,606
Not until I began to age
and -- and Brick --

605
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:26,578
Kelly, as he was
when I met him -- did not.

606
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:31,751
But by that time, Brick himself
had changed...inside.

607
00:31:31,753 --> 00:31:34,219
He wasn't just the warrior

608
00:31:34,221 --> 00:31:36,555
whose only reason for living
was combat.

609
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:37,956
He --

610
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:42,194
we were deeply,
deeply in love.

611
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:46,965
So in love, I'm ashamed to say,
that when I found out that --

612
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:49,534
how my husband stayed
young and strong,

613
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:51,403
I chose to ignore it.

614
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:53,605
You and Brick had to go
underground from time to time

615
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,073
to hide your secret, right?

616
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:56,508
Every 10 years or so,

617
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:00,813
he would re-emerge
with a new look, a new name.

618
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:04,483
And me, I was the wife,

619
00:32:04,485 --> 00:32:07,619
and I was the woman
in hiding,

620
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:11,189
and then,
when I got into my 40s,

621
00:32:11,191 --> 00:32:15,661
I became Brick's mother.

622
00:32:15,663 --> 00:32:18,196
Eleanor.

623
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:24,002
I am so tired.

624
00:32:24,004 --> 00:32:26,939
You can't imagine
the burden of it all.

625
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:29,741
I think even Brick
was through.

626
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:33,746
He could see the end of my days
were at hand, and...

627
00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:38,217
He had lived centuries
all alone,

628
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:40,386
but I don't think
he could bear the thought

629
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:41,553
of life without me.

630
00:32:43,723 --> 00:32:46,725
That's why he drove
off that bridge.

631
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:54,366
You must think
I'm a monster.

632
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:55,768
No.

633
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,137
No,
just that you married one.

634
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,241
Well, see,
here's the deal.

635
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:05,011
Now there are eight killers
out there

636
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:08,013
that we have to deal with,
not just one.

637
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:09,815
I don't think so.

638
00:33:09,817 --> 00:33:12,552
What? Why not?

639
00:33:12,554 --> 00:33:17,123
Brick used to say
the heart was key.

640
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:20,293
That was the focus
of the sacrifice.

641
00:33:20,295 --> 00:33:24,564
Are you saying that if we stop
Brick's beating heart,

642
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:26,365
then we could stop
the whole thing?

643
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:33,172
Do you know where the person is
who has the heart?

644
00:33:33,174 --> 00:33:35,608
Do you know?

645
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:47,553
Really?

646
00:33:47,555 --> 00:33:49,522
Our king daddy monster
is a stripper?

647
00:33:49,524 --> 00:33:53,159
We're pretty sure
this is gonna work, right?

648
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:57,230
Well, as long as Eleanor knows
what she's talking about.

649
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:02,035
You think Brick thought
maybe he'd burn to nothing

650
00:34:02,037 --> 00:34:03,170
when he crashed that car?

651
00:34:03,172 --> 00:34:06,540
Yeah, but he didn't,
which brings us here.

652
00:34:47,515 --> 00:34:50,150
Smell that?

653
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:51,986
You're gross.

654
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:24,686
Eleanor sent you,
right?

655
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:27,889
I figured she'd probably break
and give me up.

656
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:31,893
This won't end well for her,
of course.

657
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:34,196
Not that it's gonna end well
for you.

658
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:39,735
Oh, now, you don't think we're
gonna let you do that, do you?

659
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,336
"We"?

660
00:35:48,945 --> 00:35:50,479
I'm the guy from Phoenix
you were looking for.

661
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:01,656
Oh, you guys are stronger
than you look.

662
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:04,659
Comes with the package.
Plus, I work out a lot.

663
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,898
You can't imagine
who I was before.

664
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,835
This shy, awkward little thing
from Georgia

665
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:15,870
with a heart condition.

666
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:17,939
Then I had the surgery.

667
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:22,844
I became freaking
Xena: Warrior Princess.

668
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,751
I couldn't dissect a frog
in high school.

669
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,821
But sacrificing to Cacao?

670
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,256
Better than sex.

671
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:42,899
So, if I go real slow
and take my time and enjoy this,

672
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:46,436
I can actually show you
your own beating heart

673
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,705
before you die.

674
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,812
Aah! Aah!

675
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,609
Aah!

676
00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:49,657
Well, we better get going, uh...

677
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:53,482
We just wanted you to know
that it really is over now.

678
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:57,753
Well, it had to be,
one way or the other.

679
00:37:57,755 --> 00:38:02,525
I half thought you might fail
and Randa would come after me.

680
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:06,395
Either way,
I'd finally be at peace.

681
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,934
You take care of yourself,
Eleanor.

682
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:19,943
Wow. Back in business.

683
00:38:19,945 --> 00:38:21,344
Got the win.

684
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:24,347
Admit it --
feels good, huh?

685
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:26,282
You know, I was thinking about
what Randa said about, uh,

686
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,451
you know, what it feels like
to be a warrior.

687
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:31,520
I get it, man, I do.

688
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:35,024
I know.
I know you do.

689
00:38:35,026 --> 00:38:36,492
I don't.

690
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:39,461
Not anymore.
Hell, maybe I never did.

691
00:38:39,463 --> 00:38:41,330
Come on, Sam, don't ruin
my buzz, would you?

692
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:43,098
Dean, listen,
when this is over --

693
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,635
when we close up shop
on Kevin and the tablet --

694
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:48,771
I'm done.
I mean that.

695
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:50,539
No, you don't.

696
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:52,875
Dean,
the year that I took off,

697
00:38:52,877 --> 00:38:55,577
I had something
I've never had.

698
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,280
A normal life.

699
00:38:58,282 --> 00:39:00,983
I mean, I got to see
what that felt like.

700
00:39:03,386 --> 00:39:06,122
I want that.

701
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:08,024
I <i>had</i> that.

702
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:13,195
I think that's just how you feel
right now.

703
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:23,605
Amelia!
Amelia, this isn't funny.

704
00:39:25,074 --> 00:39:27,042
Amelia!

705
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:32,880
Riot?

706
00:39:32,882 --> 00:39:34,148
Riot!

707
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,821
Happy Birthday!

708
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:46,127
What is this?

709
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:49,631
You've never seen
a birthday cake before?

710
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:51,767
Sit.

711
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:55,004
Eat.

712
00:39:57,498 --> 00:40:01,498
