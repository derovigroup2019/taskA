1
00:00:01,892 --> 00:00:04,058
I think dad wants us to
pick up where he left off --

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,660
saving people, hunting things...

3
00:00:05,662 --> 00:00:06,911
the family business.

4
00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:08,747
We have to carry out his legacy.

5
00:00:08,749 --> 00:00:10,198
Aah!

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,466
It's a bloodline.

7
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:12,534
It's in your blood,

8
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:15,286
your father's blood,
your family's blood.

9
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:18,456
I like that John kid.
You do?

10
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,874
Yeah, I think you two
were meant to be.

11
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:21,909
Yeah, the union
of John and Mary Winchester --

12
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:24,712
<i>very</i> big deal upstairs --
top-priority arrangement.

13
00:00:24,714 --> 00:00:26,381
Are you saying that you
fixed up our parents?

14
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:27,966
The orders were
very clear.

15
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:29,717
You and Sam
needed to be born.

16
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,353
Your parents
were just meant to be.

17
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:35,089
This book.

18
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:37,442
This is dad's single
most valuable possession.

19
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:40,095
Everything he knows about
every evil thing is in here.

20
00:00:40,097 --> 00:00:41,896
And he's passed it on to us.

21
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,238
How many people
do you think dad saved?

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,372
That's his legacy.

23
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:53,124
So we got to keep going.

24
00:01:21,654 --> 00:01:23,571
Hey, sport.

25
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:25,023
Sorry about that.

26
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:26,474
Where are you going?

27
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:28,610
Work.

28
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:31,529
I just wanted to check on you
before I left.

29
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:33,748
What's that, pops?

30
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,319
One day,
I'll tell you all about it.

31
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,588
Now get some shut-eye.

32
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,507
See you
first thing in the morning.

33
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:50,215
[ Music box playing
"As Time Goes By" ]

34
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:05,180
Good night, son.

35
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:37,395
Good evening, sir.

36
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:45,653
Josie.

37
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:48,072
No one told me this initiation
was a formal affair.

38
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:50,658
Well, someone had to class up
the joint, right, Henry?

39
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,510
Ain't that the truth?

40
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:54,746
The hard part's over,
right?

41
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:57,165
We made it.

42
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:01,586
Ms. Sands?

43
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:40,375
Secura tibi facias libertate.

44
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:43,745
Servire, te rogamus, audi nos!

45
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:45,129
Henry.

46
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:47,782
Do not
let Abbadon get it.

47
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:54,255
That's impossible!

48
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:55,340
How?

49
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:41,719
Kah-nee-lah...

50
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:44,389
Poo-goh.

51
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:46,691
Kah-nee-lah...

00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:48,726
Poo-goh.

Kah-nee-lah...

54
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,533
Poo-goh.

Which of you

60
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:27,342
Uh, neither.

61
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:29,377
That's impossible.

62
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:31,814
That's absolutely...

63
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:33,232
What did I do wrong?

64
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,516
Who the hell are you,
mister?

65
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:36,735
Not now.
I'm thinking.

66
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:39,822
Please.

67
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:42,658
I can assure you
there's no need for violence.

68
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,177
One of you
must know John Winchester.

69
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,578
I'll tell you what --

70
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,697
when one of us
falls out of your closet,

71
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,199
<i>then</i> you can
ask the questions.

72
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:52,034
Yes, my apologies.

73
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:53,902
Is it absolutely essential,
sir,

74
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:56,171
that you keep
your hands on me?

75
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,292
Thank you.

76
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,761
Gentlemen,

77
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:06,348
in the absence of
any and all other explanations,

78
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,415
I'm afraid this has been

79
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:11,419
a marvelous,
tragic misunderstanding.

80
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,188
I'll be on my way.

81
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,273
That's
not happening.

82
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:15,891
There are things
of grave importance.

83
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:18,426
I do not have time to
deal with the likes of you.

84
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,813
You're not going anywhere,
007...

85
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:23,365
...till we
get some answers.

86
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,487
How did he do that?

87
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,955
You got to be
kidding me!

88
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,564
2013.

89
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:59,184
My God.

90
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,687
Guess the Mayans were wrong.

91
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:16,535
Nice taste in wheels.

92
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,373
Yours, I presume?

93
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:29,014
And there
with the holy water.

94
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,849
He's clean.

95
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,003
I could have
told you that.

96
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:37,272
Yeah, well, you can start by
telling us everything

97
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:38,690
before I
beat it out of you.

98
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:43,061
I'm quite certain this is all
beyond your understanding,

99
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,847
my alpha-male-monkey
friend.

100
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:49,184
And violence will not help you
comprehend this any easier.

101
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:51,987
Let me tell you
what I understand!

102
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:53,872
Some asshat
pops out of my closet

103
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,991
asking about my dad,
smashes up my ride.

104
00:07:55,993 --> 00:07:57,759
So why am I not
getting violent, again?

105
00:07:57,761 --> 00:08:00,546
John Winchester
is your father?

106
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:06,201
What is that?

107
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:10,923
Oh, my God.

108
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:11,757
What?

109
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,874
Run!

110
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,681
Henry.

111
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,735
Silly man,
you forgot to lock the door.

112
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,405
But then spells never were
your best subject, were they?

113
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,109
Why don't you be a doll
and give me what I want?

114
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,028
And I promise to kill you
and your friends here quickly.

115
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,080
You know
I can't do that.

116
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,782
You're not a fighter,
Henry.

117
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:47,960
Josie.

118
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,044
I know
you're still in there.

119
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:50,178
You must fight this.

120
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:54,800
I'm afraid
Josie's indisposed, Pet.

121
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,418
It looks like
it's just you and me.

122
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:03,058
Ohh! Aah!

123
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:09,031
Well, that is
no way to treat a lady.

124
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,036
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

125
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:25,631
Hey! Hey! Hey!

126
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,118
You okay, lady?

127
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,722
What the hell
are you doing?

128
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,727
Show me
what you've seen.

129
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:51,323
Thank you.

130
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:53,492
By the way,
I'm checking out.

131
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:17,299
Are you okay?

132
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:18,967
Yes, I will be.

133
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,526
It's just
all the adventures I enjoy

134
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,611
are usually
of the literary nature.

135
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:31,363
Yeah, well, now that
you're done blowing chunks,

136
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:34,516
you want to tell us
who Betty Crocker was?

137
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:36,234
Abbadon.

138
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,352
She's a demon.

139
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:38,653
No kidding.

140
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:39,788
Where'd she come from?

141
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,956
Where'd <i>you</i> come from?

142
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,625
She's from hell.

143
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:48,080
I'm from
Normal, Illinois --

144
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,381
1958.

145
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:51,633
Yeah, right.

146
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,419
Seriously?

147
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,705
Dude's time traveling
through motel-room closets?

148
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:58,707
That's
what we've come to?

149
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,375
If you could just
take me to John,

150
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:02,043
we could clear all this up,
I'm sure.

151
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,061
I've told you
that's not gonna happen.

152
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:03,895
Why not?

153
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,430
Because he's dead!

154
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:09,818
No.

155
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,990
What's it to you?

156
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:17,892
Everything.

157
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,498
I'm his father.

158
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:42,238
Driver's license says

159
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,158
he's Henry Winchester
from Normal, Illinois.

160
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,359
He knows dad's birthday,

161
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:48,244
the exact place
where he was born.

162
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:52,031
Dude,
that's our grandfather.

163
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:53,950
I'm just saying before we
break out the warm and toasties,

164
00:11:53,952 --> 00:11:56,569
let's not forget that, uh,
H.G. Wells over there

165
00:11:56,571 --> 00:11:58,371
left dad high and dry
when he was a kid.

166
00:11:58,373 --> 00:12:00,123
But maybe he didn't
run out on dad --

167
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,174
I mean, not on purpose.

168
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,141
Maybe he time-traveled here

169
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:04,377
and, I don't know,
got stuck.

170
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,763
Yeah, well, either way,
dad hated the son of a bitch.

171
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:08,598
And dad
made up for that how?

172
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,466
By being
father of the year?

173
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:13,770
Here you go.

174
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:15,722
Thanks.

175
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:17,473
Look, dad had his issues,
okay,

176
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,726
but he was
always there for us.

177
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:22,779
I freaking hate
time-travel, man.

178
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:27,099
How you doing?

179
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,485
I'll be fine.

180
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:33,840
After all,
despite everything,

181
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:37,577
I've just met my grandsons,
haven't I?

182
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,045
Henry Winchester.

183
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:40,663
It's a pleasure.

184
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:41,714
Sam.

185
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:43,466
Hello, Sam.

186
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:47,119
Dinner.

187
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:50,423
This is Dean.

188
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:51,974
Right.

189
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:53,343
Well, this has been
touching.

190
00:12:53,345 --> 00:12:55,561
How about we figure out
how to clean up your mess, huh?

191
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:57,963
Abbadon.

192
00:12:57,965 --> 00:12:59,682
Yes.

193
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:01,133
She must be stopped.

194
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:02,819
And how come she didn't die
when I stabbed her?

195
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:05,104
Because demons
can't be killed

196
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:07,607
by run-of-the-mill
cutlery.

197
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:09,192
At the very least,
you'd need

198
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:11,527
an ancient demon-killing
knife of the Kurds.

199
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:14,364
That's what this is.

200
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,032
Where'd you get that?

201
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:17,583
Demon gave it to me.

202
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:19,752
We've been around this block
so many times.

203
00:13:19,754 --> 00:13:20,820
Now, that portal

204
00:13:20,822 --> 00:13:22,789
or whatever it was
you came through --

205
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,923
is it still open?

206
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:25,541
I highly doubt it.

207
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:27,343
Why?

208
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:29,929
I'm just thinking
if we can't kill this Abbadon...

209
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:31,531
Maybe we can shove her
back where she came from.

210
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:32,632
How did you do it?

211
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:35,668
It's a blood Sigil.

212
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,688
Blood leads to blood.

213
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,056
Or their next of kin.

214
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:43,776
But Abbadon
came through it, also, right?

215
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:45,812
So can you create
this blood Sigil again?

216
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:48,981
My blood,

217
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:50,066
an angel feather,

218
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:51,084
tears of a dragon,

219
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:52,568
a pinch of
the sands of time --

220
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,537
I-I would need those
and...

221
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,989
At least a week
for my soul to recharge,

222
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:58,324
but, yes,
it's possible.

223
00:13:58,326 --> 00:14:01,878
You tapped the power of
your soul to get here?

224
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,379
I thought
only angels could do that.

225
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:06,716
You should know this.

226
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:08,634
What level are you two?

227
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:10,636
What level?

228
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:13,189
Level of knowledge.

229
00:14:14,408 --> 00:14:16,809
You're Men of Letters,
correct?

230
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:21,247
I'm a little rusty
on my boy bands.

231
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:22,348
Men of what?

232
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,601
Men of Letters,

233
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:28,738
like your father,
who taught you our ways.

234
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,407
Our father
taught us how to be hunters.

235
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:35,778
You're not.

236
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,797
Are you? Hunters?

237
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:41,233
Well, hunters are...

238
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:43,085
Hunters are apes.

239
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:45,922
You're supposed to --

240
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:47,940
you're legacies.

241
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:51,911
Legacies of what?

242
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,942
What's going on here?

243
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:13,149
No.

244
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,868
All right, well,
this was enlightening.

245
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,203
Let's hit the road,
huh?

246
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:18,488
Give him a minute,
Dean.

247
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,039
We just spent four hours
driving, okay?

248
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,273
All he did was
stare out the window

249
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:22,441
and request Pat Boone
on the radio.

250
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:23,409
He had his time.

251
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:24,944
It's just a facade,

252
00:15:24,946 --> 00:15:26,462
a way to rook our enemies

253
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:29,882
into believing
we are housed elsewhere.

254
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:32,385
Okay, enough with
the decoder talk.

255
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:33,469
How about you tell us

256
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:35,054
what this whole
Men-of-Letters business is,

257
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:36,923
or you're on your own?

258
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:38,624
It's none of
your concern.

259
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:40,459
Why,
because we're hunters?

260
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:41,978
What do you
have against us?

261
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,814
Aside from
the unthinking, unwashed,

262
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:47,650
shoot-first-and-don't-bother-to-
ask-questions-later part,

263
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:48,734
not much, really.

264
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:50,186
You know what?
Wait a second.

265
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:52,071
We're also
John's children.

266
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:57,610
You're more than that,
actually.

267
00:15:57,612 --> 00:16:01,280
My father
and his father before him

268
00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:03,916
were both Men of Letters.

269
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:06,869
As John and you two
should have been.

270
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:11,624
We're preceptors,

271
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:13,209
beholders,

272
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:17,263
chroniclers of all that
which man does not understand.

273
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:21,500
We share our findings with
a few trusted hunters --

274
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:24,103
the very elite.

275
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:25,738
They do the rest.

276
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,158
So you're like Yodas
to our Jedis.

277
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:33,362
Never mind.
You'll get there.

278
00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:35,197
Okay, but if you guys
were such a big deal,

279
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,783
then why haven't we --
or anyone we know --

280
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:40,185
ever heard of you?

281
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:41,454
Abbadon.

282
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:50,362
Henry. Why?

283
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:51,747
Why'd she do it?

284
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:53,916
I think for this.

285
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:56,368
Okay, what's that?

286
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,004
I wish I knew.

287
00:16:58,006 --> 00:16:59,922
Abbadon attacked us

288
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:02,174
the night of
my final initiation.

289
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:04,594
All secrets
were to be revealed then.

290
00:17:04,596 --> 00:17:05,678
Let me
get this straight.

291
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,879
You traveled through time

292
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:09,231
to protect something
that does you don't know what

293
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,717
from a demon
that you know nothing about?

294
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:17,690
Good.

295
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:34,457
Hand me your...
walkie-talkie.

296
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:37,877
You mean my phone?
Even better.

297
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:42,765
Operator,
I need Delta 457.

298
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:46,752
Who are you
not calling?

299
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:49,271
Our emergency number.

300
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:52,358
Yeah. Not anymore.

301
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,560
They can't all be gone.

302
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:56,445
There must be
another elder out there

303
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:58,814
who can help us figure out
how to stop Abbadon

304
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:01,200
and what to do
with the box.

305
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:03,302
Hey, uh, hi.

306
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:05,071
Can we hijack your computer
for a hot second?

307
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,875
Like you could
fit a computer in this room.

308
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:11,627
Sure.

309
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:13,212
Thanks.

310
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:14,497
Sam.

311
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,248
Yep.

312
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,466
All right, um...

313
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:19,451
give me a name --
anybody who, uh,

314
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:20,419
might have been there
that night --

315
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:21,470
one of those elders.

316
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:24,006
Um...Ackers, David.

317
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:26,242
Larry Ganem.

318
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:28,260
Um, Ted --

319
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:29,345
Okay, here it is.

320
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:32,431
Um, August 12, 1958.

321
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,600
A tragic fire
at a gentlemen's club.

322
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:36,986
Uh, 242 Gaines Street.

323
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:39,488
This is
242 Gaines Street...

324
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,473
But that was no fire.

325
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:46,862
Larry Ganem, David Ackers,
Ted Bowen, and Albert Magnus --

326
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:48,698
all deceased.

327
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,915
Albert Magnus.

328
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,250
He a friend of yours?

329
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:53,536
Even better.

330
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:09,802
These were my friends,

331
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:11,887
my mentors,

332
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:16,025
our last defense against
the Abbadons of the world.

333
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:18,244
Here's your buddy
Albert Magnus.

334
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:20,179
Albertus Magnus.

335
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:22,615
And he was hardly
a buddy.

336
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:25,534
He was the greatest alchemist
of the middle ages.

337
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:29,288
Okay, so why is he
buried here?

338
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,024
He's not.

339
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:34,960
His was the alias we'd use
when going incognito.

340
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:38,080
I believe someone planted
his name in that article...

341
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:40,499
so that if a man of letters
came looking for answers,

342
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:42,835
he'd know
something was amiss.

343
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:46,639
So someone wanted you
to come to this grave.

344
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:48,540
The question is why.

345
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:53,596
What is this?

346
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:55,931
Our crest.

347
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,818
The Aquarian Star,

348
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,720
representing
great magic and power.

349
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:04,890
They say it stood at
the gates of Atlantis itself.

350
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:06,358
Hmm.

351
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,277
It's on all the tombstones
except for this one --

352
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,412
uh, Larry Ganem.

353
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:18,504
The Haitian symbol for
speaking to the dead.

354
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:20,405
This is the message.

355
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:25,744
You boys ever
exhume a body?

356
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,442
Love what you've done
with the place.

357
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,029
Wrong night.

358
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:45,648
"Carrie" screening's
on Sunday.

359
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,368
I dig your costume,
though.

360
00:20:52,272 --> 00:20:54,740
What are you doing?

361
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:01,080
Show me
what you've seen.

362
00:21:01,082 --> 00:21:02,464
Can we
hijack your computer?

363
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:03,048
Give me a name.

364
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,133
Ackers, David.

365
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:04,967
Larry Ganem.

366
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:06,585
Tragic fire.
That was no fire.

367
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:07,386
Albert Magnus.

368
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:08,554
Thanks.

369
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:16,312
Please don't hurt me!

370
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:24,270
I like your top.

371
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:37,590
Tell me how we got
stuck doing this?

372
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:48,768
Hey, was, uh,
Larry a World War I vet?

373
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,303
No.

374
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:52,605
Well, then,
who's the stiff?

375
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:54,640
No idea.

376
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:04,434
Captain
Thomas J. Carey III.

377
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:06,869
That mean anything
to you?

378
00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:10,273
Well, somebody
wanted you to see this,

379
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:13,426
so maybe
that somebody is Larry.

380
00:22:13,428 --> 00:22:16,062
So, what,
maybe he, uh,

381
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,497
survives the attack

382
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:20,416
and hides out
with this guy's identity?

383
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,552
Okay.

384
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:25,238
What are we waiting for,
then?

385
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,789
Cover this up.

386
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,158
Let's be on our way.

387
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:43,472
What is that?
I know that tune.

388
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:46,342
"As Time Goes By."

389
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:49,362
I hope so.
It's from "Casablanca."

390
00:22:49,364 --> 00:22:51,681
Right.

391
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:55,118
Dad used to whistle it
from time to time.

392
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,020
Your father saw "Abbott
and Costello Meet the Mummy"

393
00:22:58,022 --> 00:22:59,622
at the drive-in one night.

394
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:02,959
It scared the beeswax
out of him.

395
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:06,129
So I got him this little
music box that played that song

396
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:08,431
to help him sleep at night.

397
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:10,283
It worked like a charm.

398
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:14,437
Wow,
it's hard to believe

399
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:15,888
dad was ever
scared of anything.

400
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,840
Hey, uh,

401
00:23:17,842 --> 00:23:19,275
according to
county records,

402
00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:22,612
Tom Carey
lives in Lebanon, Kansas,

403
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:26,365
and is a very happy
127-year-old.

404
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:31,237
I say
we get some shut-eye,

405
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:32,521
head over
first thing in the morning.

406
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:34,657
Wait, wait, wait.
Listen to this.

407
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:35,875
According to dad's journal,

408
00:23:35,877 --> 00:23:37,293
he once tortured
a demon that said

409
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:39,529
he made his bones
working for Abbadon,

410
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:43,449
who, it turns out,
is a Knight of Hell.

411
00:23:43,451 --> 00:23:45,701
What does that
even mean?

412
00:23:47,204 --> 00:23:49,472
Knights of Hell are
hand-picked by Lucifer himself.

413
00:23:49,474 --> 00:23:53,426
They are of the first-fallen,
first-born demons.

414
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:55,595
So very pure,
very strong.

415
00:23:57,881 --> 00:24:01,350
Legend has it that Archangels
had killed all of them,

416
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:04,520
which, as we have witnessed,
is not the case.

417
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:07,773
Unless she's
the last of her kind.

418
00:24:10,194 --> 00:24:12,394
You say
that belonged to your father?

419
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:13,996
Yeah.

420
00:24:13,998 --> 00:24:15,915
May I?

421
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:21,420
It's a hunter's journal.

422
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:24,006
I assume
Men of Letters --

423
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:25,258
you use journals, too?

424
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,877
I intended to.

425
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:31,697
I sent away for one
the day before my initiation.

426
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:36,469
As a matter of fact,
judging by my initials here,

427
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:38,137
this one, I believe.

428
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:40,389
That was yours?

429
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:43,743
It must have arrived
after...

430
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:49,598
I'm beginning to gather

431
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,751
I don't make it back
from this time, do I?

432
00:24:51,753 --> 00:24:55,988
We don't know
for sure.

433
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,875
All we do know is that
dad never saw you again.

434
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:01,244
What did he think
happened to me?

435
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:04,947
He thought
you ran out on him.

436
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:11,003
John was a legacy.

437
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:13,789
I was supposed to teach him
the ways of the Letters.

438
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:16,809
Well, he learned things
a little differently.

439
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:18,527
How?

440
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:20,479
The hard way.

441
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:23,482
Surviving
a lonely childhood

442
00:25:23,484 --> 00:25:25,818
a stinking war...

443
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,136
only to get married

444
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:30,206
and have his wife
taken by a demon...

445
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:34,827
...and later
killed by one himself.

446
00:25:36,646 --> 00:25:39,949
That man got a bum rap
around every turn.

447
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:41,650
But you know what?

448
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:44,337
He kept going.

449
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:45,504
And in the end,

450
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:49,091
he did a hell of a lot more good
than he did bad.

451
00:25:50,794 --> 00:25:51,994
I'm sorry.

452
00:25:51,996 --> 00:25:54,180
I wish I had
been there for him.

453
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:56,716
Yeah, it's a little late
for that now,

454
00:25:56,718 --> 00:25:58,217
don't you think?

455
00:26:00,003 --> 00:26:02,939
It's the price we pay for
upholding great responsibility.

456
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:03,973
We know that.

457
00:26:03,975 --> 00:26:07,893
Your responsibility
was to your family,

458
00:26:07,895 --> 00:26:10,329
not some
glorified book club!

459
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:13,499
I was a legacy.
I had no choice.

460
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:19,956
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that.

461
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,172
Hey.

462
00:27:10,174 --> 00:27:11,007
Wake up!

463
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:12,174
What? What?!

464
00:27:12,176 --> 00:27:14,126
Henry -- he's gone.

465
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:16,295
Where is he?
No idea.

466
00:27:16,297 --> 00:27:18,848
He just left a note saying
he was gonna fix everything.

467
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,600
Yeah,
or screw it all up.

468
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:23,903
All right.

469
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:34,280
Satnam.

470
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:38,317
Welcome, traveler.

471
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,935
What can I
help you with?

472
00:27:39,937 --> 00:27:41,770
I can use
a tear of a dragon

473
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:43,272
and a pinch of
the sands of time,

474
00:27:43,274 --> 00:27:44,773
but don't bother
wrapping it up.

475
00:27:44,775 --> 00:27:45,991
I'll be using it
right away.

476
00:27:45,993 --> 00:27:47,743
We don't carry
those things here.

477
00:27:47,745 --> 00:27:49,211
But can I interest you
in some kava root?

478
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:50,830
It's great for anxiety.

479
00:27:50,832 --> 00:27:54,583
In your window --
hunters' signs.

480
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:57,136
I know who you are
and what you are.

481
00:27:57,138 --> 00:27:59,505
Now give me what I need
so I can be on my way.

482
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:02,508
I agree.

483
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,427
You should be going,
stranger.

484
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,680
I understand.

485
00:28:07,682 --> 00:28:08,898
You don't know me,

486
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,217
so you're
reluctant to sell to me.

487
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:13,152
Fine.

488
00:28:13,154 --> 00:28:16,805
But please let me
purchase some chamomile

489
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:19,325
for my restless nights
before I go.

490
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:22,244
Bah-rah-gah-doh.

491
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:29,485
Sleep well.

492
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:33,038
Now we know what he meant
by "fix everything."

493
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,490
What?

494
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:36,342
He broke in to the trunk,
stole an angel feather.

495
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:37,493
I'm guessing
he's gonna whip up

496
00:28:37,495 --> 00:28:38,711
another one of those
blood spells

497
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:41,130
and Marty McFly himself
back to the 1950s.

498
00:28:41,132 --> 00:28:42,264
To do what?

499
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:43,766
Stop Abbadon
before she strikes?

500
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:45,134
Or grab dad
and haul ass.

501
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:46,469
Look,
point is he's doing it.

502
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:47,636
How?

503
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:49,722
He still needs two ingredients
for the spell.

504
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:51,023
Unless...

505
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:53,859
Unless there's some place nearby
that sells real hoodoo.

506
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:56,362
I'll call Garth.

507
00:28:56,364 --> 00:28:58,847
<i>All units, possible</i>
<i>homicide at Astro Comics.</i>

508
00:28:58,849 --> 00:28:59,681
<i>Location...</i>

509
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:01,016
Hey.
Hmm?

510
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:03,402
It just hit the wires --
one dead at Astro Comics.

511
00:29:03,404 --> 00:29:05,687
Abbadon?
Yeah, has to be.

512
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:07,456
Okay,
so she's close.

513
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,241
I'll go find Henry.
You find Larry.

514
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:11,660
Figure out
how to kill this chick.

515
00:29:20,253 --> 00:29:24,089
So, Henry is dead.

516
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:29,762
I was so sure that --
that he had survived.

517
00:29:29,764 --> 00:29:31,680
Yes, well, um,
like I said --

518
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:33,782
I found his journal
and was hoping

519
00:29:33,784 --> 00:29:36,235
you could
fill in the gaps

520
00:29:36,237 --> 00:29:37,653
and explain to me
what happened

521
00:29:37,655 --> 00:29:39,221
that night in 1958.

522
00:29:39,223 --> 00:29:40,722
It doesn't matter.

523
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:42,658
They're gone. We're gone.

524
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,443
But Abbadon is not.

525
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:46,278
Abbadon was a hired gun.

526
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,083
She killed us all
that one night.

527
00:29:51,085 --> 00:29:53,369
Everyone but you.

528
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:56,405
She blinded me.

529
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:58,374
It's a miracle I survived.

530
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:00,709
It's okay, dear.

531
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:05,848
But she did not
get what she came for.

532
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,350
The box.

533
00:30:09,753 --> 00:30:12,004
Listen, Abbadon is here,

534
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:13,806
and she wants this thing.

535
00:30:13,808 --> 00:30:17,526
So I need to know everything
there is to know about it.

536
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:21,814
In the box is the key

537
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:25,100
to every object,
scroll, spell

538
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:27,570
ever collected
for thousands of years

539
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:29,938
under one roof.

540
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,776
It is the supernatural
mother lode.

541
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:38,831
Poo-goh.

542
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:40,916
Kah-nee-lah....

543
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:42,451
Henry, wait!

544
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,121
This is a risk
I have to take.

545
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:47,306
And what if you die,
huh?

546
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:49,975
Who said you'll even
survive a jump?

547
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:52,928
You cannot begin to
understand how I felt

548
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,513
after reading
John's journal.

549
00:30:54,515 --> 00:30:56,131
Oh, I think I can.

550
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:58,800
See, I've read that thing
more times than you can imagine,

551
00:30:58,802 --> 00:30:59,852
and it hurts every time.

552
00:30:59,854 --> 00:31:01,737
Maybe so,
but you didn't let him down!

553
00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:03,772
I did!
Just like you said!

554
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:05,941
Well, I was wrong.
No!

555
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:07,476
No, you were right.

556
00:31:07,478 --> 00:31:08,777
And I'm going to go back

557
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,162
and give him
the life he deserves,

558
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:11,447
not the one
he was forced to live.

559
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:12,698
What if it's
not meant to be?

560
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,832
Then it will be!

561
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:14,783
How can you be so sure?

562
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:16,952
Because it's
the right thing to do!

563
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:20,372
I can save him
and stop Abbadon!

564
00:31:20,374 --> 00:31:21,457
How?

565
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:23,842
By going back
an hour before she attacks

566
00:31:23,844 --> 00:31:25,094
and making preparations.

567
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:27,162
If you do that
and you change the past,

568
00:31:27,164 --> 00:31:29,882
me and Sam
might cease to exist!

569
00:31:29,884 --> 00:31:32,768
I'm aware that time
is a delicate mistress,

570
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,170
but I'm willing to bet on
this being for the best.

571
00:31:35,172 --> 00:31:36,689
I understand that
this is not

572
00:31:36,691 --> 00:31:38,507
your idea of a happy ending,
okay,

573
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:40,509
and that you're disappointed
that me and Sam

574
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:41,777
are mouth-breathing
hunters.

575
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:44,530
But you know what?
We stopped the Apocalypse.

576
00:31:44,532 --> 00:31:47,483
If this works
the way I planned,

577
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:50,703
there will never be
an Apocalypse to stop.

578
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:54,607
So...

579
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:56,959
Abbadon wants the key

580
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:58,577
so she can
get her hands on it.

581
00:31:59,964 --> 00:32:02,631
Can you imagine
what she would do with that?

582
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:03,999
So, how do we stop her?

583
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:04,883
How do we stop Abbadon?

584
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:06,201
You don't.

585
00:32:12,008 --> 00:32:16,562
If you know
where the key is,

586
00:32:16,564 --> 00:32:19,381
then take it to
these coordinates.

587
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:21,883
Throw it in.

588
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:23,885
Shut the door forever.

589
00:32:25,155 --> 00:32:26,655
And walk away.

590
00:32:26,657 --> 00:32:30,075
Wait,
w-why would I do that?

591
00:32:30,077 --> 00:32:33,395
Because it is
the safest place on earth,

592
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:36,248
warded against
any evil ever created.

593
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,585
It is impervious to
any entry,

594
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:41,403
except the key.

595
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:44,006
Right, but then
all that knowledge would be --

596
00:32:44,008 --> 00:32:47,009
would be lost
and gone forever.

597
00:32:47,011 --> 00:32:50,346
And that is
the price we have to pay

598
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:53,632
for keeping it away
from Abbadon.

599
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:59,555
You do...
have the key, don't you?

600
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:01,857
I don't, um...

601
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:05,944
But, uh, my brother...

602
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,948
...my brother does.

603
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:12,651
How rude.

604
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,637
You haven't finished
your tea, Sam.

605
00:33:17,073 --> 00:33:18,106
Abbadon.

606
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:22,628
The years have not
been kind, Larry.

607
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:29,334
Sammy?

608
00:33:29,336 --> 00:33:31,336
No.

609
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:33,005
Much sexier.

610
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:34,390
Try again.

611
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:37,810
Abbadon.
Good boy.

612
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:39,645
Now listen up --
I want to make a good,

613
00:33:39,647 --> 00:33:40,763
old-fashioned horse trade.

614
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:43,899
Henry and the key
for your brother.

615
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:45,601
Or he dies.

616
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:48,404
Am I clear?

617
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:49,638
Crystal.

618
00:33:51,024 --> 00:33:53,609
On the road to Larry's,
there's a processing plant.

619
00:33:53,611 --> 00:33:56,612
Don't keep me waiting.

620
00:33:56,614 --> 00:33:58,864
Abbadon has Sam?

621
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:03,035
She wants to trade
you and the key for Sam's life.

622
00:34:03,037 --> 00:34:07,539
If I could just go back,
stop this all from happening.

623
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:08,924
And what if you can't?

624
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:11,960
I can't take that risk --
not with Sammy on the hook now.

625
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:13,879
I can't abandon my son,
Dean!

626
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:15,497
Not again!

627
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:17,633
I need to do this.
I'm sorry.

628
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:20,269
Kah-nee-lah...Poo-goh.

629
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:22,137
Well, I'm sorry, too.

630
00:34:41,435 --> 00:34:43,903
Sorry about that.

631
00:34:45,356 --> 00:34:47,473
No, you're not.

632
00:34:47,475 --> 00:34:49,859
You've wanted to do that
since we met.

633
00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:53,696
Henry, you need to
understand something.

634
00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:58,534
When my dad died,
I couldn't save him...

635
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:02,538
...no matter
how bad I wanted to.

636
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:09,262
I never want that to
happen to Sam...ever.

637
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:14,717
If there's a chance
that I can save him,

638
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,853
I'm gonna do it.

639
00:35:19,356 --> 00:35:22,225
He's my brother.
He's the only family I got.

640
00:35:31,986 --> 00:35:34,120
Don't do it, Dean.

641
00:35:34,122 --> 00:35:35,655
Too late for that now.

642
00:35:35,657 --> 00:35:37,023
That's the problem
with you hunters.

643
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:38,691
You're all
short-sighted.

644
00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:40,410
Yeah, at least
we're not extinct.

645
00:35:40,412 --> 00:35:42,295
Abbadon!

646
00:35:42,297 --> 00:35:45,531
I'll send Henry here over
with the box.

647
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:48,584
You do the same with Sam.
No tricks.

648
00:35:48,586 --> 00:35:51,554
My only interest
is Henry and the key.

649
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:53,806
You two are free to go.

650
00:35:58,178 --> 00:36:00,396
You can do this
standing,

651
00:36:00,398 --> 00:36:01,931
or you can do it
crawling.

652
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:03,316
Your call.

653
00:36:12,192 --> 00:36:14,410
Henry, I'm sorry.

654
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:16,496
Save it.

655
00:36:18,082 --> 00:36:19,365
Don't do this, Dean.
This is a bad idea.

656
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:21,000
Shut your mouth.
Let's go.

657
00:36:24,455 --> 00:36:25,788
Come on.

658
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:32,762
We had a deal!

659
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:35,848
Surprise.

660
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,749
I lied.

661
00:36:40,804 --> 00:36:42,355
Henry!
Wait. Wait.

662
00:36:43,057 --> 00:36:44,474
Ohh!

663
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:49,929
You're not the only one.

664
00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:52,281
I'm gonna do it.

665
00:36:52,283 --> 00:36:54,433
He's my brother.
He's the only family I got.

666
00:36:54,435 --> 00:36:55,985
So, what are you
thinking?

667
00:36:55,987 --> 00:36:57,603
Can you
slow Abbadon down?

668
00:36:57,605 --> 00:36:59,322
Because if you can,
I'll do the rest.

669
00:37:01,493 --> 00:37:03,042
Whoo!

670
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:05,211
What a blast.

671
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:06,829
Now, give me the box.

672
00:37:13,787 --> 00:37:15,638
Where is it?!

673
00:37:17,258 --> 00:37:18,124
Okay.

674
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:22,478
We can do this
the hard way.

675
00:37:32,023 --> 00:37:34,473
Why am I stuck?!

676
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,032
A devil's trap
carved into the bullet.

677
00:37:44,985 --> 00:37:46,869
You're gonna have to
get close.

678
00:37:46,871 --> 00:37:49,822
And "close" means
it could get ugly.

679
00:37:49,824 --> 00:37:52,208
I know.
But you do that for blood.

680
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:58,181
You still didn't kill me.

681
00:37:58,183 --> 00:38:01,384
No, but you'll wish
we did.

682
00:38:03,804 --> 00:38:05,605
The demon trap
in your noggin

683
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:07,356
is gonna keep you
from smoking out.

684
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:09,108
We're gonna cut you
into little steaks

685
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,777
and bury each strip
under cement.

686
00:38:11,779 --> 00:38:14,346
You might not be dead,
but you'll wish you were.

687
00:38:17,684 --> 00:38:18,901
We did it.

688
00:38:23,624 --> 00:38:25,908
No, <i>you</i> did it.

689
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,494
For a bookworm,
that wasn't bad, Henry.

690
00:38:32,332 --> 00:38:35,968
I'm sorry I judged you two
so harshly for being hunters.

691
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:39,839
I should have
known better.

692
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:41,874
About?

693
00:38:43,944 --> 00:38:46,979
You're also Winchesters.

694
00:38:46,981 --> 00:38:49,065
As long as we're alive,

695
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:52,051
there's always hope.

696
00:38:56,657 --> 00:39:00,493
I didn't know my son
as a man,

697
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:04,614
but having met you two...

698
00:39:04,616 --> 00:39:08,334
I know I would have been
proud of him.

699
00:39:47,563 --> 00:39:50,465
I get it now.

700
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:52,867
Hmm?

701
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:55,503
What Cupid said

702
00:39:55,505 --> 00:39:56,888
about heaven busting ass

703
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,406
to get mom and dad
together.

704
00:39:58,408 --> 00:40:01,042
The Winchesters
and the Campbells --

705
00:40:01,044 --> 00:40:04,462
the brains and the brawn.

706
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:08,333
Well,
I'm glad you see it.

707
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:11,269
All I see in our family tree
is a whole lot of dead.

708
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:18,559
Hey, I, uh...

709
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:20,478
Found this
in Henry's wallet.

710
00:40:25,117 --> 00:40:27,201
Dad looks happy.

711
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:32,507
Kind of makes you wish
he knew the truth, huh?

712
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:35,343
I mean, all those years
thinking his old man ditched

713
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,211
when the poor son of a bitch

714
00:40:37,213 --> 00:40:40,498
really came here
and saved our bacon.

715
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,334
Freaking time-travel,
man.

716
00:40:45,087 --> 00:40:47,055
You think it would have
made a difference?

717
00:40:47,057 --> 00:40:49,807
What?

718
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:52,093
Dad.

719
00:40:52,095 --> 00:40:54,178
If he'd had
