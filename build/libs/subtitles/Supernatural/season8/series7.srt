having done so.

715
00:40:58,588 --> 00:41:03,691
No. I won't do that.

716
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,146
Now, as you were.

717
00:41:08,148 --> 00:41:09,914
They won't even notice
you were gone.

718
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:12,283
Sam: ...track down
the other piece.

719
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:15,420
You're with us on this one,
right, Cass?

720
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:17,755
Cass, you okay?

721
00:41:18,924 --> 00:41:21,209
I'm -- I'm fine.

722
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:24,495
And, yes, I'm with you --
if that's all right.

723
00:41:32,004 --> 00:41:35,172
Sam: It is, right?

724
00:41:35,174 --> 00:41:37,392
You two are good?

725
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:41,079
Yeah.

726
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:46,104
