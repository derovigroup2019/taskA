1
00:00:03,312 --> 00:00:05,480
Where's the road?

2
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:06,850
You're freakin' alive.

3
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:07,927
What the hell happened?

4
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,697
Standing too close
to exploding Dick

5
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:12,097
sends your ass
straight to Purgatory.

6
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:16,629
You were in Purgatory?

7
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:18,728
Well,
how'd you get out?

8
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:23,601
What, no thanks
for saving your hide?

9
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:25,004
I got something
you need.

10
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,506
- Yeah, what's that?
- A way out.

11
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:28,507
What's in it for you?

12
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:30,038
I'm hopping a ride.

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,510
We made it, brother.
I can't believe it.

14
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,710
You and me both.

15
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:35,443
What about Cass?
Was he there?

16
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:37,210
Yeah,
Cass didn't make it.

17
00:00:37,212 --> 00:00:39,447
Cass, I think
we better g--

18
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:40,984
Cass?

19
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:42,687
So Cass is dead?
You saw him die?

20
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:44,488
I saw enough.

21
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,622
I don't want to be a prophet.

22
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:46,887
He was
our responsibility.

23
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:48,554
And you didn't answer
the damn phone.

24
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:50,487
Let's find him.

25
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,723
The King of Hell just
snapped my girlfriend's neck.

26
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:55,192
Crowley kidnapped you.
I saw that.

27
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:56,426
Then you escaped.

28
00:00:56,428 --> 00:00:57,894
How?

29
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:59,196
It was a tablet.

30
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:00,465
There's another tablet?

31
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:01,632
Did this tablet
have a name?

32
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:02,933
"Demons."

33
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:04,034
What about demons?

34
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:06,270
Banish all demons
off the face of the Earth,

35
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:07,839
lock them away
forever.

36
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:18,250
So sorry to have kept
you waiting, Mr. Vili.

37
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:22,053
It's just...it's been so long
since you checked in with us.

38
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:24,556
We had to dig
through our archives.

39
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:26,290
Don't worry about me,
dear.

40
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:27,691
I've got plenty of time.

41
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:29,292
Which box is it again?

42
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:30,492
One.

43
00:01:30,494 --> 00:01:32,360
I'm...sorry.

44
00:01:32,362 --> 00:01:36,197
Did you say one,
as in box number one?

45
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,998
If memory serves.

46
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,940
During
our last renovation,

47
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:50,276
we had to replace
the safe boxes,

48
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:53,445
and we put yours
inside a new one.

49
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,647
Ah...

50
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:20,104
I'm...sorry, sir,
but...is that a bone?

51
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,273
Not just any bone,
my dear.

52
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:26,776
An extremely valuable one.

53
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:32,180
Well, I'm happy we were able
to keep it safe for you

54
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:34,015
all these years.
Hmm.

55
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:36,919
Is there anything else
I can help you with today?

56
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:40,689
Why, yes,
now that I think about it.

57
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:44,093
I'd like to make
a withdrawal.

58

60
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,362
Are you kidding me?

61
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:01,663
You're kidding me.

62
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:03,065
What?

63
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:05,501
Is it too much to ask if we can
swing by and check on my mom?

64
00:03:05,503 --> 00:03:06,668
"Swing by"?

65
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,237
It's a day's drive
in the opposite direction.

66
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,938
You know that, right?

67
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,407
Yes. I understand
we're in a hurry.

68
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:13,908
Okay, well,
then, what's the problem?

69
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,445
Channing's broken neck
is my problem!

70
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:22,618
As in I'd rather not see my mom
twisted into a corkscrew.

71
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,086
- Kid's got a point, Dean.
- Stay out of this.

72
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,787
Kevin, your mom is fine.

73
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,157
How can you
possibly know that?

74
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,825
Because Crowley needs her to be,
okay?

75
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:31,993
In fact,
he's probably got

76
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:33,528
the place stacked
with bodyguards right now,

77
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,763
protecting her
so that when you do show up,

78
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:37,031
they'll pounce on you both.

79
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,100
Is that supposed to make me
feel better?

80
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,269
She's bait, man,
plain and simple.

81
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:44,072
And you want to swim right up
and bite the hook?

82
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:51,079
Look, we have got Crowley
by the short and curlies, okay?

83
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:54,115
All we need to do is find
the tablet, whip up the spell,

84
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:58,086
and -- boom! --
Sunshine and Sandy beaches.

85
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:03,692
Dean,
my mom's all alone.

86
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:06,394
She's surrounded by demons.

87
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:07,762
Can you
really not understand

88
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:09,497
why I want to make sure
she's okay?

89
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,308
Son of a bitch.

90
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,210
Fine. Let's go.

91
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:33,322
Tiger mom, 9:00.

92
00:04:33,324 --> 00:04:34,923
Where?

93
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,358
Left window.

94
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:47,837
She seems okay.

95
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:54,843
Sad...but okay.

96
00:04:57,914 --> 00:04:59,682
Check out the mailman.

97
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:02,985
Yeah, that's Carl.

98
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:04,320
So what?

99
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:06,622
Yeah, well, Carl's filled
your mom's mailbox

100
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:09,025
three times
since we've been sitting here.

101
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:11,127
He's a demon?

102
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:12,762
And see the gardener?

103
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:17,066
Think that plant
needs any more water?

104
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:10,756
He'll be back.
You just have to believe.

105
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:11,891
Thanks, Eunis.

106
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:14,227
And I do believe.

107
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,831
I just...
wish I could do more.

108
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,468
Linda, you're doing
all you should by staying here.

109
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,605
He needs to know he has a home
to come back to.

110
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:31,078
Hi, Mom.

111
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,881
Oh!

112
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:35,216
Kev-- Kevin!

113
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:37,685
Ah -- oh! Oh!

114
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:39,020
What...

115
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:41,088
She's clean.

116
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:47,862
Do you smell that?

117
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:57,305
<i>Et secta diabolica,</i>
<i>omnis congregatio, omnis legio,</i>

118
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:59,207
<i>omnis incursio</i>
<i>infernalis adversarii,</i>

119
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,609
omnis spiritus exorcizamus!

120
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,282
Aah!

121
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:10,885
Eunis!

122
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:13,521
That's not Eunis.

123
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:21,461
Mrs. Tran, your friend
was possessed by a demon.

124
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:23,363
Have you ever seen
"The Exorcist"?

125
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:26,666
Is that what you've been doing
all year --

126
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:28,835
watching television?

127
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:33,173
Did you
really have to kill her?

128
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:36,377
The demon would have warned
Crowley where Kevin was

129
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:37,711
if we didn't.

130
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:41,549
And Crowley is the one
who kidnapped you?

131
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:44,619
Yeah. He needs me to translate
his stupid tablet

132
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:46,587
so he can take over the universe
or something.

133
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,055
Which is why
we need to get it

134
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:50,091
so that we can slam
the gates of Hell forever

135
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:51,559
with Crowley inside.

136
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:54,429
So that things like <i>that</i>
don't ever happen again.

137
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:59,166
Prophet of the Lord,
huh?

138
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:03,838
It does have
a nice ring to it.

139
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,708
I'll get packed.

140
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,076
We're gonna need
a safe house

141
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:09,910
since Crowley's been
to the cabin, so --

142
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:10,978
Safe house?

143
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,013
I thought we were going
to get the tablet.

144
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:14,181
Uh, <i>we</i> are.

145
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:16,383
You're taking a trip
to a demon-free zone.

146
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:17,951
And risk letting Kevin

147
00:08:17,953 --> 00:08:20,654
fall into the hands
of this Crowley again?

148
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:21,822
I don't think so.

149
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:24,158
Ms. Tran, all due respect,
Dean's right.

150
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,327
Crowley --
he's not just a killer.

151
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,396
He trades in torment.

152
00:08:28,398 --> 00:08:30,965
And if he can find a way
to separate your soul from you,

153
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,667
he'll take that soul to hell
and -- and roast it

154
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,070
till there's nothing left
but black smoke.

155
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:37,406
Look, it's best
if you let us handle this.

156
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:39,507
I understand.

157
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:42,244
But it's not my soul
I'm worried about.

158
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:44,112
It's my son's.

159
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:47,816
Kevin,
you want to back us up here?

160
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,419
Came all the way down here
to pull her out of the fire.

161
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:52,388
Now she wants to jump
right back in.

162
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,992
Like I can tell her
what to do?

163
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:07,235
All right. Coming with us
has conditions --

164
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:10,005
uh, hex bags
to stay off the bad guys' radar

165
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,909
and, uh, you're gonna have to
get inked up.

166
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:15,711
Do what, now?

167
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:16,978
Yeah, uh...

168
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:20,549
...you, too, shortstop.

169
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,618
Keeps the demons out.

170
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,086
Fine.

171
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:27,021
Really?

172
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:30,558
What,
like it's my first tattoo?

173
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,562
[ The Reverend Horton Heat's
"The Devil's Chasing Me" plays ]

174
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:52,014
? black clouds in the east ?

175
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:54,283
? the devil's chasing me ?

176
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,118
You smell it, Sammy?

177
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,453
Burning flesh?

178
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,955
Revenge. So close.

179
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,161
Hey, how'd you do
that reverse-exorcism thing?

180
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:08,664
Just said the verse
backwards.

181
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,301
? The devil's chasing me ?

182
00:10:27,582 --> 00:10:29,817
So, place is clean,
far as I can tell.

183
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,489
All right.
Positive thoughts.

184
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:52,974
You hid the word of God
in a diaper bag?

185
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:54,909
No.

186
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:05,754
Shut up.

187
00:11:14,564 --> 00:11:16,556
Been nothing but trouble
with these lockers.

188
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:19,194
Got broke into damn near
every day for a while.

189
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:21,896
Could never figure out
who it was till yesterday.

190
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:24,066
Oh, so you know who did it?
Sure.

191
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:27,069
Was Clem Smedley, a guy
who worked the desk before me.

192
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:28,537
Please tell me
he's down at county right now.

193
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:30,773
Yep,
waiting for arraignment.

194
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,608
Thanks.

195
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,311
Should have known they'd plant
a LoJack in one of them bags.

196
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,413
Sharp guy, that Jerry.

197
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:39,816
He'll be a fine replacement
for me.

198
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:41,418
Right.

199
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,722
Well, in one of those lockers,
there was a tablet.

200
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,026
Do you know where it is?

201
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:53,363
Can I even acknowledge that
without my lawyer here?

202
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:56,366
Uh, look,

203
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:57,934
I'm sure we can work out

204
00:11:57,936 --> 00:11:59,803
a little, uh,
something-something

205
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:01,938
with the locals
if you just cooperate.

206
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,476
What kind of
something-something?

207
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,887
I don't think he knows,
man.

208
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:19,890
Leniency?

209
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:21,992
Oh, he knows.

210
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:25,762
Where's the angel?

211
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:31,401
So,
here's what I'm thinking --

212
00:12:31,403 --> 00:12:33,103
full immunity
from all charges,

213
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:36,172
both past, present,
and future.

214
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:44,781
Hey.

215
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:45,948
Dean. Come on.

216
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,250
You feel that?

217
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:52,722
There's a stream.

218
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:54,623
Go on.

219
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,126
It runs through a clearing
not far from here.

220
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:58,428
I'll show you.

221
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,300
How about
you just tell me?

222
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,405
Hey.

223
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:09,773
Dean!

224
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:12,576
Pawn shop,
First and Main.

225
00:13:12,578 --> 00:13:13,844
Go on.

226
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:17,480
Three days' journey.

227
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,248
Follow the stream.

228
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,083
There's a clearing.

229
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:23,986
You'll find your angel
there.

230
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,427
You know what, Mutt?

231
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,030
I believe you.

232
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,041
Dean?

233
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:54,048
Come on.

234
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,170
Whoa.

235
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:13,672
Hey.

236
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:20,545
Hello, sir.
Agents Neil and Sixx, FBI.

237
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:23,682
Uh,
we're looking for a tablet.

238
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:26,585
About, uh, yea big, got some
hieroglyphic crap on it.

239
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:28,487
Sold to you
by a thief named Clem.

240
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:30,522
- Ring a bell?
- Nope.

241
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:35,127
Hey, Lyle, I've had a really,
really bad day today,

242
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,962
so I'm not in the mood
to dillydally.

243
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:40,699
If you want to do this the rough
way, I am happy to oblige.

244
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:41,933
Sure.

245
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:45,204
We can do it that way,
if you want to get famous.

246
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:50,610
That your car outside?

247
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:51,978
What's it to you,
mail-order?

248
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,446
Hey, pal!

249
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:54,914
I got it.

250
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,383
I notice you're driving
with expired tags,

251
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:59,452
maybe because
you just acquired it in a trade,

252
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:02,355
and I'm guessing that means
you haven't registered it yet,

253
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:04,423
which means
you haven't paid the tax.

254
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:05,691
Is that correct?

255
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:07,093
None of your business.

256
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:11,697
Kevin, average blue book
on a 2010 Ferrari F430 Spider?

257
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,065
$217,000.

258
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:15,834
And the 5% Wyoming tax?

259
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:17,936
$10,850.

260
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:21,707
$10,000.

261
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,342
Something tells me

262
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:26,112
you're the type who might balk
at a tax bill that big.

263
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:29,181
W-what is this,
an FBI audit?

264
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:31,050
No. But my brother,

265
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:34,353
who happens to work for the
Wyoming tax assessor's office

266
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:35,554
could arrange that

267
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:38,757
if he thought something untoward
was happening here.

268
00:15:42,194 --> 00:15:43,594
So what's it going to be --

269
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:47,197
the tablet or that piece of
eurotrash crap you call a car?

270
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:01,446
Sure this is
the right place?

271
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:03,414
It's what
the pawn slip says.

272
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,117
Kevin?

273
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,620
Who wants to know?

274
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:10,654
Oh, relax, Dean.

275
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:13,290
I'm not going to steal
your Prophet.

276
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:18,829
Ah. And you must be
Kevin's mother.

277
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:23,901
Um...Beau.

278
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:27,238
And it is
my absolute pleasure.

279
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,806
And, um, Kevin.

280
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:32,376
Imagine my luck.

281
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:35,045
Here I was,
working so hard looking for you

282
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:38,482
that I never stopped to think
you might be looking for me.

283
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:39,984
I have something for you.

284
00:16:39,986 --> 00:16:42,386
What is it?

285
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:47,292
An invitation, dear man,
to a very exclusive auction.

286
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:51,162
Let me guess -- where you'll be
selling the tablet?

287
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:54,432
Well, when we acquire an item
as hot as the word of God,

288
00:16:54,434 --> 00:16:57,135
it's smart to unload it
as fast as possible.

289
00:16:57,137 --> 00:16:59,270
And we are
in such desperate need

290
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:00,872
of a headliner
for tonight's gala.

291
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:02,073
Well, I hope you have

292
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:04,275
three extra tickets
to your little eBay party,

293
00:17:04,277 --> 00:17:05,910
'cause the Prophet's
with us.

294
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:08,413
Oh, if you're worried
about the safety of the Prophet,

295
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:13,152
rest assured that we have a
strict "no casting, no cursing,

296
00:17:13,154 --> 00:17:15,655
"no supernaturally flicking
the two of you against the wall

297
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:17,123
just for the fun of it"
policy.

298
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,260
Is that right?
How'd you manage that?

299
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:22,796
Well, I <i>am</i> the right hand
of a God, after all --

300
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:23,797
Plutus, specifically.

301
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:27,501
Is that even a planet
anymore?

302
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:29,970
It's the God of greed.

303
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:33,140
And my liege has warded
these premises

304
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:36,177
against hell, heaven,
and beyond --

305
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,446
quite necessary
with some of the players we see.

306
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:39,847
And incidentally,

307
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:45,154
quite possibly the safest place
your precious Prophet could be.

308
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:48,791
Mm. Well, since time
is of the essence,

309
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:51,661
perhaps I'll just go ahead
and add a plus-three

310
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:54,197
to the Prophet's invitation.

311
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,100
Copacetic?

312
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:02,538
Well,
thank you, Mr. Peanut!

313
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,176
All right.

314
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:08,678
What do we have to bid?

315
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:12,548
What? We can't just show up
there empty-handed.

316
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,818
Dean, all we have to our names
is a few hacked gold cards.

317
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,819
All right. Well, then, we're
gonna have to get creative.

318
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:19,622
Huh.

319
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:23,259
Well...

320
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:24,627
No. Mnh-mnh.

321
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:26,563
Say it
and I will kill you,

322
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:29,165
your children,
and your grandchildren.

323
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:32,068
Okay, okay. Uh...

324
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,203
Wait a second.

325
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,038
They -- these auctions --
they display the items

326
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,405
to the bidders beforehand,
right?

327
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,773
Yeah, so?

328
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:39,974
So all we got to do

329
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:41,676
is get Kevin close enough
to memorize the spell.

330
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,344
What do you think,
brainiac?

331
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:44,879
Think you can swing it?

332
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:46,447
Of course he can swing it...

333
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:49,783
if the bumper stickers
on my Previa mean anything.

334
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:54,555
They didn't mean it,
baby.

335
00:19:19,014 --> 00:19:20,214
Now, now, Dean.

336
00:19:20,216 --> 00:19:23,918
The system only works
when everyone participates.

337
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:36,631
I'll be back for this.

338
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:55,886
How the hell are we
supposed to know who's who?

339
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:58,421
It's pretty simple, Dean.
They're all monsters.

340
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:01,658
Hey, hey.

341
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:08,665
Great.

342
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,434
I guess we're not as original
as we thought.

343
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:11,735
It's okay. It's okay.

344
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:13,537
We just got to come up
with a plan "B."

345
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:17,141
And what, pray tell, could
possibly have been plan "A"?

346
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:18,475
Bring the Prophet

347
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:20,644
to the most dangerous place
on Earth,

348
00:20:20,646 --> 00:20:25,783
memorize the tablet,
and then va-moose?

349
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,686
Hello, boys.

350
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:39,061
Crowley.

351
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:40,729
Kevin.

352
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:42,964
What a pleasure
to see you.

353
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:45,667
Sorry about
your little playdate.

354
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:46,967
Her name?

355
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,369
Ah.

356
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:50,041
Well, if you're gonna make
an omelet,

357
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,543
sometimes you have to break
some spines.

358
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:54,212
And who is this
lovely young thing?

359
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:55,513
Must be your sister.

360
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:57,182
Aah!

361
00:20:57,184 --> 00:20:58,950
Stay away from my son.

362
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:01,119
Charming.

363
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:02,187
Defiling her corpse

364
00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:03,989
has just made number one
on my to-do list.

365
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:05,958
Unh, unh, unh, unh.

366
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,160
Don't mind a little love tap,
but anything more,

367
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:10,295
and our mookie pals here
may just throw you out,

368
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:11,363
and that would be a shame.

369
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:14,232
He's right, Dean.
It's not worth it.

370
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:17,302
Listen to moose,
squirrel.

371
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:23,108
Ah.
Here comes our host.

372
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,944
Honored guests,
please take your seats.

373
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:26,646
That's Plutus?

374
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:28,781
What is he,
God of the candy aisle?

375
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:33,387
Gentlemen,
the auction is starting.

376
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:36,724
Good luck
with the bidding.

377
00:21:38,827 --> 00:21:40,594
Nice right hook.

378
00:21:42,764 --> 00:21:44,598
Dean Winchester?

379
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,800
Do I know you?

380
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:49,036
Uh, no,
but, uh, I knew Castiel.

381
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,705
You're an angel?

382
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:54,242
This -- this was the nearest
vessel on short notice.

383
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:56,143
We don't usually come to things
like this, but, uh...

384
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:59,447
You're chasing the magic rock?
We protect the word of God.

385
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:04,285
Well, awesome job so far,
uh...Alfie.

386
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,587
Actually,
my name is Samandriel.

387
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:08,322
Let's just stick
with Alfie.

388
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:10,458
I wanted to ask you
about Castiel.

389
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,994
What happened to him?

390
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:18,699
Well, me and Cass -- we, uh --
we iced Dick Roman

391
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:21,869
and got a one-way rocket ride
to Purgatory for our trouble.

392
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:25,340
But you escaped.
Did -- did Castiel?

393
00:22:31,748 --> 00:22:37,117
You know, there are some
in heaven who still believe,

394
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,287
despite his mistakes,

395
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:43,023
that Castiel's heart
was always in the right place.

396
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:46,258
Are you one of them?

397
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,064
I think too much heart
was always Castiel's problem.

398
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,494
Cass!

399
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,997
Dean.

400
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:29,404
Cass?

401
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:36,611
Damn,
it's good to see you.

402
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:37,946
Nice peach fuzz.

403
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:39,047
Thank you.

404
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:41,616
You should meet somebody.
This is Benny.

405
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:42,917
Benny, this is Cass.

406
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,118
Hola.

407
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,820
How did you find me?

408
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:47,822
The bloody way.

409
00:23:47,824 --> 00:23:50,058
You feeling okay?

410
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,027
You mean am I still...

411
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:55,363
Yeah, if you want to be
on the nose about it, sure.

412
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:56,631
No. I'm perfectly sane.

413
00:23:56,633 --> 00:24:00,301
But, then, 94% of psychotics
think they're perfectly sane,

414
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:03,738
so I guess we'd have to ask
ourselves, "what is sane?"

415
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,007
That's a good question.

416
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:08,076
- Why'd you bail on Dean?
Dude --

417
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:11,679
the way I hear it,
you two hit monster land,

418
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:13,614
and hot wings here
took off.

419
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:15,983
I figure he owes you
some backstory.

420
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:18,418
Look, we were surrounded,
okay?

421
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,686
Some freak jumped Cass.

422
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:21,755
Obviously, he kicked its ass,
right?

423
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:24,524
No.

424
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:26,259
What?

425
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:30,130
I ran away.

426
00:24:30,132 --> 00:24:32,499
You ran away?

427
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:35,134
I had to.

428
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:38,271
That's your excuse for leaving
me with those gorilla-wolves?

429
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:39,506
Dean --

430
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:42,142
you bailed out and, what,
went camping?

431
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:45,379
I prayed to you, Cass,
every night.

432
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:46,513
I know.

433
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:47,948
You know
and you didn't...

434
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,218
What the hell's
wrong with you?

435
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,254
I am an angel
in a land of abominations.

436
00:24:53,256 --> 00:24:56,257
There have been things hunting
me from the moment we arrived.

437
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:57,491
Join the club!

438
00:24:57,493 --> 00:24:59,393
These are not just monsters,
Dean. They're Leviathan.

439
00:24:59,395 --> 00:25:00,828
I have a price
on my head,

440
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,099
and I've been trying to stay
one step ahead of them, to --

441
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:08,069
to keep them
away from you.

442
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:10,004
That's why I ran.

443
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,612
Just leave me, please.

444
00:25:17,614 --> 00:25:19,180
Sounds like a plan.
Let's roll.

445
00:25:19,182 --> 00:25:21,983
Hold on, hold on.

446
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:25,686
Cass,
we're getting out of here.

447
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:27,688
We're going home.

448
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,156
Dean, I can't.

449
00:25:29,158 --> 00:25:30,157
You can.

450
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,525
Benny, tell him.

451
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:34,694
Purgatory has
an escape hatch,

452
00:25:34,696 --> 00:25:37,530
but I got no idea
if it's angel-friendly.

453
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:38,530
We'll figure it out.

454
00:25:38,532 --> 00:25:42,100
Cass, buddy, I need you.

455
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:45,070
Dean...

456
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:48,439
And if Leviathan want to take
a shot at us, let them.

457
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:50,975
We ganked those bitches
once before.

458
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:52,577
We can do it again.

459
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:54,579
It's too dangerous.

460
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:57,348
Let me bottom-line it
for you.

461
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,550
I'm not leaving here
without you.

462
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,185
Understand?

463
00:26:04,556 --> 00:26:06,691
I understand.

464
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:20,772
Ladies, gentlemen,
and...other,

465
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:25,142
welcome to this
once-in-a-lifetime event.

466
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:27,211
Samandriel.

467
00:26:28,113 --> 00:26:29,647
Slumming it, are we?

468
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:34,218
The first name in magical
and alchemical esoterica.

469
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,087
Our prices may be high,

470
00:26:36,089 --> 00:26:40,625
but our quality is unmatched,
and we stand by our products.

471
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:43,562
Don't know why you're so keen
on that hunk of dirt.

472
00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:46,298
So it tells you
how to blast back a few demons?

473
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,566
I'll just make more.

474
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:52,171
Can't get rid of all
of my black-eyed boys, Samantha.

475
00:26:52,173 --> 00:26:55,107
Yeah, we'll see.

476
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:56,842
And across the plane...

477
00:26:56,844 --> 00:26:59,244
All right. So, how much we got
for plan "B"?

478
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:02,014
Uh, well, we got
our hacked credit cards,

479
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:05,417
$2,000,
and a, uh, Costco membership.

480
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:09,955
Our first item,
the amulet of Hesperus.

481
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:14,193
Let's start the bidding with,
um, three tons of dwarven gold?

482
00:27:14,195 --> 00:27:16,528
Ah. This lady.

483
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,331
I have three.
Do I have, uh, four?

484
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,599
Ah. Four, gentlemen here.

485
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:22,635
Four. Going for five.

486
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:24,236
Five?

487
00:27:24,238 --> 00:27:26,706
Five to this lady.

488
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,041
Plan "C"?

489
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:30,209
Big time.

490
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:32,011
Any other bids? Any other bids?

491
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:35,282
I'm gonna use the restroom.

492
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:37,083
Sold.

493
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:12,184
Oh, sorry.

494
00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:34,106
This isn't
the men's room.

495
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:43,683
Okay.

496
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:48,688
Our next item up for bid,
the hammer of Thor, Mjoelnir.

497
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,025
A finger bone
from the frost giant Ymir.

498
00:28:57,498 --> 00:29:03,436
Uh...the bone and,
uh, 5/8 of a virgin.

499
00:29:08,577 --> 00:29:09,843
Ah. Sold.

500
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,949
Plan "C" tanked.

501
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:17,784
Maybe you should try plan "D"
for dumbass.

502
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:22,956
Our next lot,
the word of God, capital "G" --

503
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,692
very old, very rare.

504
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:29,329
$3 billion.

505
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:31,632
Whoa. Whoa.

506
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,568
The "Mona Lisa."

507
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:38,173
The <i>real</i> "Mona Lisa,"
where she's topless.

508
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:41,477
Vatican City.

509
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:44,748
Alaska.

510
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,751
Palin
and a bridge to nowhere?

511
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:48,919
No, thanks.

512
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,054
All right. The moon.

513
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,790
You're bidding
the moon?

514
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,091
Yeah.
Claimed it for hell.

515
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,194
Think a man named Buzz
gets to go into space

516
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:58,461
without making a deal?

517
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,264
Ah. I'm sorry, gentlemen.

518
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,633
It seems that our reserve price
has not been met.

519
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,769
So in order to stimulate
the bidding,

520
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,071
we're going to add an item
to this lot --

521
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,741
Kevin Tran,
Prophet of the Lord.

522
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,110
No!

523
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,150
Mr. Tran is the only person on
Earth who can read this tablet,

524
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,952
which makes them
a perfect matching set.

525
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,721
So out of your league.

526
00:30:23,723 --> 00:30:27,325
So,
do I hear a bid of --

527
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,394
No, stop!

528
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:31,562
I'll give you
whatever you want.

529
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:35,366
I have a 401, my house.

530
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:38,636
Good effort, Ms. Tran,
but I'm afraid

531
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:41,072
this is a little out
of your price range.

532
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,142
My soul.

533
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,310
Mom, don't!

534
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:47,679
I bid my soul!

535
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,581
Are you sure?
That's a big move.

536
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:51,549
Interesting.

537
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:54,719
If it's souls
that you're after,

538
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:57,022
I can give you
a million souls.

539
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,656
Hey, flyboy,
are you gonna get in on this?

540
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:01,426
We guard the souls in heaven.
We don't horse-trade them.

541
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:02,393
So we have a deal.

542
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:05,129
It's not about the quantity,
chief.

543
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:07,898
It's about the sacrifice.

544
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,737
This little lady's soul is
the most valuable thing she has.

545
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:14,639
It's everything.

546
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:17,809
Are you willing to offer
everything, Mr. Crowley?

547
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:21,913
Tick-tock.

548
00:31:21,915 --> 00:31:26,017
Fine. You win.

549
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:28,587
I bid...

550
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:30,889
My own soul!

551
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,300
Mr. Crowley,
you don't have a soul.

552
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:45,904
Congrats, sweetheart.

553
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:48,607
Thank you. Thank you.

554
00:32:07,785 --> 00:32:11,854
Losing my soul --
is it going to hurt?

555
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:14,223
Probably.

556
00:32:15,993 --> 00:32:17,860
Will I die?

557
00:32:17,862 --> 00:32:20,596
No. You'll just wish
you were dead.

558
00:32:20,598 --> 00:32:23,699
Okay.

559
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,342
It's time.

560
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:40,616
You all right?

561
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:42,118
Yeah.

562
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,853
Can I --
can I just have a minute?

563
00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:48,424
Dean, this sucks.

564
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:49,558
Are you kidding me?

565
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,360
We're about to close
the gates of Hell forever.

566
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:53,029
If you ask me,
we got off cheap.

567
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:05,643
Excuse me, miss.

568
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:09,246
Hi.
My name is Sam-- Alfie.

569
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:11,048
I'm an angel.

570
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,883
Who works at Wiener Hut?

571
00:33:12,885 --> 00:33:16,487
No. This is, uh --
it doesn't matter.

572
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:19,724
Uh, what you did in here
was amazing,

573
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:20,859
and I want you to know

574
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:22,627
that my friends and I
can protect your son.

575
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:25,663
The Winchesters are
exceptional men,

576
00:33:25,665 --> 00:33:29,668
but...they're just men.

577
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,470
If Kevin comes with us --

578
00:33:31,472 --> 00:33:33,472
Oh, no, no.

579
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:37,175
The last time that angels
tried to help my son,

580
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:42,513
I watched them die, and Kevin
went missing for a year.

581
00:33:42,515 --> 00:33:49,253
So, no offense, but I'm gonna
take my chances with them.

582
00:33:56,629 --> 00:34:00,264
Mjoelnir,
I've missed you.

583
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,669
Where's the kid?

584
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:08,072
What are you gonna do
with her soul?

585
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:10,475
Whatever I want.

586
00:34:10,477 --> 00:34:11,943
I might sell it,

587
00:34:11,945 --> 00:34:17,749
or maybe I'll just tuck it away
with my other precious objects,

588
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:19,785
let them keep me warm
at night.

589
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:20,886
Mm.

590
00:34:26,494 --> 00:34:28,361
Whenever you're ready,
dear.

591
00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:37,070
Wait!

592
00:34:39,874 --> 00:34:43,878
Hello, boys.

593
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
Crowley.

594
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:54,688
No. You can't.
My warding spells.

595
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,324
Your girl Friday

596
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:59,393
showed me a few loopholes.

597
00:35:00,895 --> 00:35:04,965
No offense, but I'm going to
take my chances with them.

598
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,233
Now, that...

599
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:09,537
...was very, very stupid!

600
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:19,547
And all it cost me was
an island in the South Pacific.

601
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:21,916
I love a bargain.

602
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:34,294
Can't do all my tricks,
but I can do enough.

603
00:35:34,296 --> 00:35:35,662
Get out of her!

604
00:35:37,398 --> 00:35:41,266
If I had a nickel for every time
someone screamed <i>that</i> at me...

605
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,308
Getting in touch with your
feminine side, huh, Crowley?

606
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,176
Something like that.

607
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:54,546
Well, come and get him.

608
00:35:59,351 --> 00:36:01,352
One out of two ain't bad.

609
00:36:01,354 --> 00:36:03,488
Watch the kid!

610
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,790
Kevin, don't!
Let Dean take care of it.

611
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,058
Sam, move!

612
00:36:23,573 --> 00:36:25,340
Don't!

613
00:36:25,342 --> 00:36:29,544
You know what's better
than one private island?

614
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:33,249
<i>Two</i> private islands.

615
00:36:42,727 --> 00:36:45,462
Okay. Give it back.

616
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:47,898
Give it back.

617
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,606
Where'd you get
the 5/8 of a virgin?

618
00:37:00,578 --> 00:37:01,311
Oh, no.

619
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:15,525
Mom!

620
00:37:32,142 --> 00:37:34,143
Well, that was exciting.

621
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:41,651
Good luck
closing the gates to Hell...

622
00:37:42,352 --> 00:37:44,486
...without this.

623
00:37:44,488 --> 00:37:49,625
Surprising what mommy dearest
has rattling around in her head.

624
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:51,460
Want to know
who your real father is?

625
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:54,296
Scandalous.

626
00:37:54,298 --> 00:37:55,798
Crowley!

627
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,502
I know we're not mates,
Kevin,

628
00:38:00,504 --> 00:38:04,039
but one word of advice --
run.

629
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:06,775
Run far and run fast.

630
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:08,376
'Cause the Winchesters --

631
00:38:08,378 --> 00:38:11,980
well, they have a habit
of using people up

632
00:38:11,982 --> 00:38:14,582
and watching them die bloody.

633
00:38:17,919 --> 00:38:21,288
Toodles.

634
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:40,543
Has she said anything?

635
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:49,652
Listen, Kev,
what your mom went through --

636
00:38:49,654 --> 00:38:50,720
it's hell.

637
00:38:50,722 --> 00:38:53,322
Trust me, I know.

638
00:38:53,324 --> 00:38:55,925
But she seems tough.
She'll pull it together.

639
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:03,566
You tried to kill her.

640
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:08,504
Kid, in this life --

641
00:39:08,506 --> 00:39:09,805
Shut up!

642
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:13,075
I don't want to hear any more
of your crappy speeches.

643
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:19,648
I just want to talk to my mom
alone.

644
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,318
Sure.

645
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,088
Five minutes.

646
00:39:30,427 --> 00:39:31,961
Mom...

647
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:45,041
Dean, were you really
going to, uh...

648
00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:47,343
What?
Slit soccer mom's throat?

649
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:50,346
Yeah, I was.
I wish I had.

650
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:52,415
Dean --

651
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:53,483
It was Crowley, Sam.

652
00:39:53,485 --> 00:39:55,418
No matter what meat suit
he's in,

653
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,986
I should have knifed him.

654
00:39:58,656 --> 00:40:00,290
I mean, yeah,
it would have sucked,

655
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,825
and I would have hated
myself,

656
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:04,927
but what's one more nightmare,
right?

657
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:13,036
It seem a little quiet
in there to you?

658
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:20,578
Kevin?

659
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,846
Kevin!

660
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:27,384
You've got to be
kidding me!

661
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:28,986
Hey.

662
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:30,821
What?

663
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:35,593
What's it say?

664
00:40:35,595 --> 00:40:40,598
Uh, that they bolted,
that we shouldn't come looking,

665
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,567
and since we lost the tablet,
Kevin figures we don't need him.

666
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:44,335
Yeah,
but Crowley still does.

667
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:45,703
What's that kid thinking?!

668
00:40:45,705 --> 00:40:48,840
He thinks
people I don't need anymore --

669
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:51,376
they end up dead.

670
00:40:51,378 --> 00:40:54,981
Dean, that -- that --
that's not true.

671
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:56,349
You know that.

672
00:41:00,554 --> 00:41:03,123
Dean! Dean!

673
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:05,492
Aah!

674
00:41:05,494 --> 00:41:06,560
Dean!
