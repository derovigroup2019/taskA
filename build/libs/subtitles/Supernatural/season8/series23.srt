1
00:00:00,962 --> 00:00:02,408
I'm about to close
the Gate of Hell forever.

2
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:05,494
? Carry on, my wayward son

3
00:00:06,504 --> 00:00:10,239
? there'll be peace
when you are done ?

4
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:11,573
Ugh!

5
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:15,244
? Lay your weary head to rest

6
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:17,763
? Don't you cry no more

7
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:19,315
You were in Purgatory?

8
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:20,582
It felt pure.

9
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:23,185
I don't hunt anymore.
I found something.

10
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:24,303
Did you look for me?

11
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:25,621
Kevin Tran.

12
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:27,356
Thought you could
elude me forever?

13
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:28,924
God built a series of tests.

14
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:30,943
When you've done all three,
you can slam the Gates of Hell.

15
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:33,446
Where do we start?
Kill a hound of hell.

16
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:34,897
An innocent soul
has to be rescued from Hell

17
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,316
- and delivered unto heaven.
- And the final test?

18
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:38,484
To cure a Demon.

19
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:40,236
? Once, I rose above
the noise and confusion ?

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:41,821
Abaddon --
a knight of Hell.

21
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:42,922
She's gone.

22
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:44,040
My name is Naomi.

23
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:46,108
We rescued you.

24
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,878
? I was soaring ever higher

25
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,112
The Angel Tablet.

26
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:51,380
I won't hurt Dean.

27
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:52,965
Kill him.

28
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,950
We're family.

29
00:00:55,952 --> 00:00:57,636
I have to protect
this tablet now.

30
00:00:57,638 --> 00:00:59,171
These trials --

31
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:01,173
they're purifying me.

32
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:04,143
? I hear the voices
when I'm dreaming ?

33
00:01:04,145 --> 00:01:05,728
Metatron?
I'm the scribe of God.

34
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,264
Heaven needs your help,
Castiel.

35
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:12,968
? Carry on, my wayward son

36
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,271
I'm killing everyone
you've ever saved.

37
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:16,605
Maybe we should just take
the deal.

38
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:18,607
The trials --
you'll give them up.

39
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:20,993
Kick it in the ass
like we always do.

40
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:22,445
Are you with me?

41
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:23,996
? ...no more

42
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:31,871
On the house, Sheriff.

43
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:34,290
Oh, thanks, Nance,
but I didn't order --

44
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:36,959
so...
Good luck.

45
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,177
...what are we drinking?

46
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:40,179
Roderick?

47
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:43,265
Wow, Jody.

48
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:44,750
Words cannot begin
to describe

49
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:47,803
the injustice that
that picture does to you.

50
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:53,275
Come on.

51
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:57,196
What?
Look at you.

52
00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:01,367
The fancy career,
the suit.

53
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:04,820
I'm pretty much what I am --
small-town girl.

54
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:09,074
We do share something,
you and I.

55
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:10,876
What?

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,728
Loss.

57
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:26,926
My son and my husband.

58
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:29,762
How did you know?

59
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,067
I've lost someone, too.

60
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:46,695
It's not a date
till I've cried.

61
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:50,699
So now you've cried.

62
00:02:57,624 --> 00:03:00,009
Oh, this is crazy.

63
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:02,428
This is crazy.

64
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:06,048
<i>I'm</i> crazy.

65
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:13,522
He's attractive, though,
right?

66
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:16,592
He's hot.

67
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:26,602
<i>Manu mortis accesso,</i>
<i>spiritus vitae recedit.</i>

68
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:46,255
You have less than one minute
before a very dear, attractive,

69
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:49,958
and slightly tipsy friend
of yours snuffs it.

70
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,527
Call it off, Crowley.

71
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:53,462
Because?

72
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,614
Because it's over,
you son of a bitch.

73
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:56,966
We want to deal.

74
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:58,684
30 seconds.

75
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:02,154
We stop the trials,
and you stop the killing.

76
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:06,141
I want the Demon Tablet --
the whole Demon Tablet.

77
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:08,527
Fine, but then the Angel Tablet
comes to us.

78
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:09,578
On what grounds?

79
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,163
On the grounds
that you're a douche bag

80
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:13,332
and no douche bag
should have that much power.

81
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:14,833
Deal or not?

82
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:21,123
First, I need to hear
two little words --

83
00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:26,378
I surrender.

84
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:35,301

86
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:07,169
You hid the Demon Tablet
underneath the devil?

87
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:08,203
Seriously?

88
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:10,222
What? I was delirious.

89
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:22,384
You sure
this is gonna work?

90
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:25,571
What choice do we have?

91
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:29,274
All right, listen,
this is a secret lair.

92
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:30,943
You understand me?

93
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:32,861
No keggers.

94
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:35,614
I don't have any friends.

95
00:05:35,616 --> 00:05:38,066
Yeah, well,
just lay low.

96
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:39,618
Who knows?

97
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,421
You'll be a mathlete again
before you know it.

98
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:45,207
You guys?

99
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,460
You're doing
the right thing.

100
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,272
What was he like?

101
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,591
Who?

102
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:07,730
Oh. God?

103
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,766
Mm, pretty much
like you'd expect.

104
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:17,939
Larger-than-life, gruff,
bit of a sexist.

105
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:21,744
But fair --
eminently fair.

106
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:27,499
The Nephilim was a monster,
Castiel.

107
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:29,284
And the next trial?

108
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:31,887
Across the street.

109
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,289
His name
is Dwight Charles.

110
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,626
I've been listening in
on the Angel radio.

111
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:40,112
Cupid frequency,
actually.

112
00:06:40,114 --> 00:06:43,298
And he is the next
on their list.

113
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,017
Their list?

114
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,438
To do
the horizontal mambo.

115
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,141
Slap bellies.

116
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,360
To find love.

117
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,329
Oh. Yes.

118
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:59,748
Well, that.

119
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,202
He's slotted to be dinged by
Cupid's arrow within 24 hours,

120
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:06,004
which is good for us,
because the second trial

121
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:08,657
is retrieving
Cupid's bow.

122
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:10,626
No killing?

123
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:15,948
No killing.

124
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:47,880
Hello, boys.

125
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:52,334
What's
that old expression?

126
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:55,036
Success has many fathers.

127
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:56,972
Failure is a Winchester.

128
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:59,575
Where's the stone?

129
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:00,955
You show us yours,
and we'll show you ours.

130
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,228
Really, Dean?

131
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,897
I'm trying to conduct
a professional negotiation here,

132
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,182
and you want to talk
dangly bits?

133
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:08,884
The stone.

134
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,455
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slowly.

135
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:16,942
There she is.

136
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:22,781
And the contract?

137
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:30,706
Yeah, I'm sure there's
no hidden agendas in <i>there.</i>

138
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,208
The highlights --
we swap tablets,

139
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,911
you stand down
from the trials forever.

140
00:08:35,913 --> 00:08:38,246
You stop killing
everyone we've ever saved.

141
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:39,631
Agreed.

142
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:49,057
Unh-unh-unh.

143
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,592
Nice try, squirrel.

144
00:08:51,594 --> 00:08:53,094
Moose is doing
these trials.

145
00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:54,112
Moose signs.

146
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:55,380
No, no, no.

147
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:57,866
He's not signing anything
until I read the fine print.

148
00:08:57,868 --> 00:09:00,035
I can read it.

149
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:02,103
Hey, you wanted me here.
I'm here.

150
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:04,406
But I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let him screw us even more.

151
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,607
What's this?

152
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,960
Trouble in paradise,
boys?

153
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:17,219
What is it, Nathaniel?

154
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,821
One of our freelancers
has reached out to us.

155
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:22,758
He's found Castiel.

156
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:26,061
Where?

157
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:30,015
A drinking establishment
in Houston, Texas.

158
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,650
And...

159
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:34,152
What?

160
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:37,973
He says
Castiel was not alone.

161
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:40,275
Who was he with?

162
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:43,412
By the description,
I-I think it was him --

163
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:46,415
the scribe.

164
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,502
You're gonna move
your lips

165
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,454
the whole way up here,
aren't you?

166
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:56,992
You know
why I always defeat you?

167
00:09:56,994 --> 00:09:58,176
It's your humanity.

168
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:00,161
It's a built-in handicap.

169
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:02,464
You always put emotion

170
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:05,467
ahead of good, old-fashioned
common sense.

171
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:11,339
Let's have the big galoot
sign it now, shall we?

172
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:29,218
Is this a joke?

173
00:10:32,194 --> 00:10:34,362
You realize
all I have to do is...

174
00:10:34,364 --> 00:10:35,881
Unh-unh-unh.

175
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:39,251
Demonic handcuffs,
jackass.

176
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:42,471
No flicking, no teleporting,
no smoking out --

177
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,873
oh, and...
no deal.

178
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,477
Which pretty much means
that you're our bitch.

179
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,394
Fine.

180
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:51,713
You want to play chain gang?
Let's.

181
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:55,600
You saddled yourself
to the wrong bull, mate.

182
00:11:00,356 --> 00:11:02,991
I can do this all day,
'cause you know what?

183
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:04,609
Damn, it feels good!

184
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:06,578
But sooner or later,

185
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,397
you're gonna have to face it --
you're ours.

186
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,951
Which means
that your demon ass

187
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:15,921
is going to be a mortal ass
pretty damn quick.

188
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:18,540
What's
he mouthing on about?

189
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,742
You're the third trial,
Crowley.

190
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,673
What are you reading?

191
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:31,125
Personal advertisements.

192
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:38,849
The faster that man finds love,
the faster the Cupid will come.

193
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:40,851
Trust me.

194
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:43,253
I'm friends with friends
who do this for a living.

195
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:47,925
Help you gents?
Yes.

196
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:51,028
Would you say
that you're looking for, uh,

197
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,229
a partner in crime...

198
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:58,819
...or, uh, someone
who's into nurse role-play

199
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:00,988
and light domination?

200
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,160
Brother,
it's 10:00 a.m. on a Tuesday.

201
00:12:06,162 --> 00:12:08,662
Uh, we'll have two drafts,
please.

202
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:12,466
Coming up.

203
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:17,138
You're not the most subtle tool
in the shed, are you?

204
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:20,641
Kill him.

205
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:26,964
Next one won't wing you.

206
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:28,182
Take it someplace else.

207
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:33,154
Let him go.

208
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:35,823
Haven't you caused enough harm
already, Castiel?

209
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:39,827
Stop. Please, Castiel,
don't make this any worse.

210
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,996
Please.

211
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,195
You really think
this is gonna hold me,

212
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:35,199
that you're gonna cure me
or whatever it is?

213
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:49,647
He's primed.

214
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:51,398
How you feeling?

215
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,236
Honestly, for the first time
in a long time,

216
00:13:55,238 --> 00:13:57,387
it feels like
we're gonna win.

217
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:58,906
I'm good.

218
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:01,058
All right, well,
no dancing in the end zone

219
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,076
until we're finished.

220
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:04,111
What's the good father's
playbook say now?

221
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:07,164
Well...

222
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,999
Now that we got
the consecrated ground,

223
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:11,401
I just, uh

224
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:15,122
I slip Crowley one dose of blood
every hour for eight hours

225
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:17,741
and seal the deal
with a bloody-fist sandwich.

226
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:18,909
That should do it.

227
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:20,761
Your blood's supposed to be
purified, isn't it?

228
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:26,583
You ever, uh -- you ever done
the "forgive me, father" before?

229
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:28,769
Well, once,
when we were kids.

230
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:32,523
Which is why I have no clue
what to say now.

231
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:35,643
Well, I mean, I could give you
suggestions if you want.

232
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:37,645
O-okay. Yeah, sure.

233
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:39,113
All right.

234
00:14:39,115 --> 00:14:40,781
Well,
I'm just spit-balling here,

235
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:45,119
but if I were you, uh...

236
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:48,772
Ruby, killing Lilith,

237
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:51,992
letting Lucifer out,
losing your soul,

238
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:54,325
not looking for me when I went
to Purgatory,

239
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,935
Thanks.
for starters.

240
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:04,288
Or, hey, h-how about what
you did to, uh, Penny Markle

241
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,589
in the sixth grade?

242
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:06,807
Why don't you lead
with that?

243
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:09,343
Well, that was you.

244
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:13,914
Carry on.

245
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,758
Okay, um...

246
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:48,265
...if anybody's listening,
here goes.

247
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:53,187
Dean,
I need your help.

248
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:54,938
Little busy, Cass.
Take a number.

249
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,440
I'm afraid
this can't wait.

250
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:58,025
Naomi
has taken Metatron.

251
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:02,696
And you know Metatron how?

252
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:04,698
I've been working with him
on the Angel trials.

253
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,984
The what?
We're gonna shut it all down --

254
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:09,236
Heaven, Hell,
all of it.

255
00:16:16,462 --> 00:16:17,461
I know you.

256
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:19,546
We've never
officially met.

257
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,450
Naomi.

258
00:16:27,306 --> 00:16:29,757
Your reputation precedes you.

259
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,409
The Archangels --

260
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:35,062
wanted me to debrief you
after God left.

261
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,749
"Debrief" me.

262
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,317
Is that what you call it?

263
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:41,551
Well,
how would you know?

264
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:43,237
You ran
before I had the chance.

265
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:47,408
But...here we are.

266
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:51,695
I just have one question
before we begin.

267
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:54,698
You had to know that we would
leap at the chance

268
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,918
to extract all of God's secrets
from that head of yours,

269
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,089
which is why
I ask myself...Why?

270
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:05,626
Why did the scribe suddenly
come in from the shadows?

271
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:12,132
And what are you doing
with Castiel?

272
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:20,424
"Of the blessings
set before you,

273
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:23,811
make your choice
and be content."

274
00:17:27,365 --> 00:17:30,117
Not a big reader,
are we?

275
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:37,658
Metatron, the guy
who was full-on crazy,

276
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,877
cat-lady-hoarder
angel yesterday --

277
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:41,745
now he wants
to save Heaven?

278
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,214
Yes, he wants to.

279
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:46,200
But I'm the only one
who can.

280
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:50,637
I can't fail, Dean,
not on this one.

281
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:51,755
I need your help.

282
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:55,225
Look, Cass,
that's all well and good, okay,

283
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:56,760
but you're asking me
to leave Sam,

284
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:58,795
and we've got Crowley in there
tied and tressed.

285
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:00,180
Now,
if anybody needs a chaperone

286
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:02,015
while doing
the heavy lifting, it's Sam.

287
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,319
You should go.

288
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:08,021
Seriously.

289
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:10,374
Oh, what, and leave you here
with the King of Hell?

290
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:11,592
Come on.

291
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:13,093
I got this.

292
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:16,897
And if you guys can lock
the angels up, too...

293
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:18,815
That's a good day.

294
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:25,822
Look, I...

295
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:28,175
I'm down with sending the angels
back to Heaven,

296
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:29,710
just 'cause they're dicks.

297
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:31,211
But the Demons?

298
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:32,479
This is on us.

299
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:34,932
Start the injections now.

300
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:37,601
If I'm not back in eight hours,
finish it,

301
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:39,052
no questions,
no hesitation.

302
00:18:39,054 --> 00:18:41,338
Yeah.

303
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:11,251
You really think injecting me
with human blood

304
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:12,386
is gonna make me human?

305
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:14,838
Did you read that
on the back of a cereal box?

306
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:19,209
Aah!

307
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:32,940
You're miles out of your league,
moose.

308
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:38,745
See you in an hour.

309
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:46,903
Is this a joke?

310
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:49,106
No.
It's the word of God.

311
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:51,358
What?
It's a tablet.

312
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,093
All right, translate.
That's what you do.

313
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:54,744
Okay.

314
00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:56,880
Um,
it's the Angel Tablet,

315
00:19:56,882 --> 00:20:00,250
which I've never laid eyes on
in my life.

316
00:20:00,252 --> 00:20:02,769
You want a translation
in like six hours

317
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:05,556
when it took me six months
and a dead mom

318
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:08,108
to translate
a piece of the Demon Tablet?

319
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:11,979
And according to your own words
this morning...

320
00:20:13,198 --> 00:20:14,764
...this is not what I do.

321
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:15,949
It's what I <i>did.</i>

322
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:17,818
You told me I was out,
Dean.

323
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,870
Yeah, well --
and if this is gonna be

324
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:22,656
the "guys like us are never out"
speech, save it.

325
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:25,576
Dean's right.
Cass!

326
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:27,711
There is no out.
Only duty.

327
00:20:27,713 --> 00:20:29,112
Get the hell off me.

328
00:20:29,114 --> 00:20:32,583
You are a Prophet of the Lord,
always and forever...

329
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:35,785
...until the day
you cease to exist,

330
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:37,471
and then another Prophet
takes your place.

331
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:42,309
Now, are you clear
as to the task before you?

332
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,682
Then do it, and let's go.

333
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:13,507
Aah!

334
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,160
What the hell,
Crowley?

335
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:22,165
Biting?! Seriously?!

336
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:40,150
<i>Inferni sectatores,</i>
<i>nunc audite regem.</i>

337
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:49,526
For the love of everything,
whoever is hearing this --

338
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:55,165
if anyone is hearing this --
this is your king.

339
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:58,802
Send help immediately.

340
00:22:13,118 --> 00:22:15,170
Anything?
You've been gone long enough.

341
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:16,954
No.

342
00:22:17,456 --> 00:22:20,040
There was <i>one</i> female,
but...

343
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:21,575
What?

344
00:22:21,577 --> 00:22:23,677
...I don't think
she was female.

345
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,130
Anything here?

346
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:28,582
Free drinks.

347
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:31,268
Your, uh, buddy over there
thinks you saved his life.

348
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:39,476
Do you really think it's wise
to be drinking on the job?

349
00:22:39,478 --> 00:22:42,563
What show
<i>you</i> been watching?

350
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,265
Talk to me.

351
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:47,267
Are you sure about this?

352
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:49,453
I mean, it's one thing

353
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,371
me and Sammy
slamming the gates to the pit,

354
00:22:51,373 --> 00:22:55,125
but you -- you're --
you're boarding up Heaven,

355
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:57,244
and you're locking
the door behind you.

356
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:01,665
Yeah. I know.

357
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:05,919
You did a lot of damage
up there, man.

358
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:08,589
You think they're just gonna
let that slide?

359
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:14,428
Do you mean
do I think they'll kill me?

360
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,480
Yeah, they might.

361
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,467
So this is it?

362
00:23:22,854 --> 00:23:24,971
E.T. goes home.

363
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:31,862
Hey, there.

364
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:32,996
Where's Ed?

365
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:35,716
Flu. I'm Gail.
Well, okay, then.

366
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:36,650
Showtime.

367
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:38,818
Let me give you
a hand.

368
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,321
Oh, thanks.

369
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:42,673
Ah.
You're a real gentleman.

370
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:44,174
Hey.

371
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:45,992
Holy crud, this is like
the first five minutes

372
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,311
of every porno
I've ever seen.

373
00:23:47,313 --> 00:23:49,429
Thanks.

374
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,633
Gail, Rod.

375
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:54,735
Ma'am.

376
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:56,353
Rod rides a stool here
most days.

377
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:02,192
I'll be seeing you both.

378
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:09,099
Thanks for the help.

379
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:10,100
No problem.

380
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:16,807
Damn, that's sweet.
Damn, that's sweet.

381
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:21,745
? Oh,
it's so nice to be with you ?

382
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:24,464
? I love all the things
you say and do ?

383
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:26,249
How about
the next one's on me?

384
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:29,336
? And it's so nice
to hear you say ?

385
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:32,389
? you're gonna please me
in every way ?

386
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,511
How we doing, Moose?

387
00:24:37,513 --> 00:24:40,981
Ain't it about time
for the next love injection?

388
00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:44,518
? Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes

389
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,553
? turn and face the strange

390
00:24:46,555 --> 00:24:49,022
? ch-ch-changes

391
00:24:49,024 --> 00:24:51,658
? just gonna have to be
a different man ?

392
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:56,413
? time may change me,
but I can't trace -- ?

393
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:16,416
Did you really think you could
kidnap the King of Hell

394
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:19,219
and no one was gonna notice,
dumb nuts?!

395
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:24,591
Hello, boys.

396
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:26,943
That's <i>my</i> line.

397
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:30,263
Abaddon?

398
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:32,032
They told me
you were dead.

399
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:33,283
So not.

400
00:25:33,285 --> 00:25:35,769
And the rest
of the cavalry?

401
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:38,455
Oh, no, it's just
little, old, unkillable me.

402
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:43,777
Brilliant.

403
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:46,797
Why send in a few grunts
when you can send in a knight?

404
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,282
Say your prayers,
Moose.

405
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:54,621
That'll do.

406
00:25:54,623 --> 00:25:56,673
Undo these.

407
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:58,642
I'll kill him myself.

408
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,336
That was an order,
was it?

409
00:26:09,338 --> 00:26:12,189
I am your King.

410
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:14,140
About that...

411
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Hello, brother.

412
00:26:20,482 --> 00:26:21,698
Give us your bow.

413
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,166
What?

414
00:26:23,168 --> 00:26:26,503
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey.

415
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:29,172
Talk first, stab later.

416
00:26:31,793 --> 00:26:33,326
Do you know what I find
the most shocking

417
00:26:33,328 --> 00:26:34,661
about time-traveling
through a closet

418
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:36,296
and landing
in the year 2013?

419
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:39,132
Aah!

420
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:40,684
Somebody thought
it was a good idea

421
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:42,335
to make you
the King of Hell.

422
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:47,190
You know what that boy's
trying to do, right?

423
00:26:49,393 --> 00:26:52,696
He's trying
to shut the Gates of Hell.

424
00:27:06,077 --> 00:27:10,497
Right now you and I are gonna
talk about regime change.

425
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,500
You little whore.

426
00:27:13,502 --> 00:27:15,635
I am your k--

427
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:30,684
I love the suit.

428
00:27:30,686 --> 00:27:33,052
Aah! Aah!

429
00:27:38,743 --> 00:27:41,745
Aaaah!!

430
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:52,439
I've been afraid to go home
for some time now.

431
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:56,075
Orders used to come once a day,
and now it's chaos.

432
00:27:56,077 --> 00:27:59,880
It all seems to be
breaking down.

433
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:03,466
And you think
you can fix that?

434
00:28:03,468 --> 00:28:07,304
With time, yes.

435
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:13,760
Take it, then.

436
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:20,934
You've been digging.

437
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:24,321
Why are you doing this --
<i>this?</i>

438
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:27,707
Do you have any idea
what it would be like

439
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:33,807
to be plucked from obscurity,
to sit at God's feet,

440
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:39,169
to be asked
to write down his word?

441
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:45,291
The ache I felt
when he was gone,

442
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:50,764
telling myself,
"Father's left,

443
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:54,517
but look what he's left us --
paradise."

444
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,469
But you and your Archangels

445
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:59,272
couldn't leave well enough
alone.

446
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:04,160
You ran me from my home.

447
00:29:05,313 --> 00:29:09,633
Did you really think
you could do all of that to me

448
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:12,819
and there'd be
no payback?

449
00:29:25,267 --> 00:29:27,717
Ahh.

450
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:30,003
You did good back there,
Moose.

451
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:34,507
I'll deny it if you ever
quote me, but I'm a proud man.

452
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:35,675
I'm proud of you.

453
00:29:37,112 --> 00:29:38,845
Thanks.

454
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:41,448
Hold on.
Uh, w-what's that?

455
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,700
It's what it looks like.

456
00:29:43,702 --> 00:29:44,851
Are you joking?

457
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:46,987
I just saved your life.

458
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:49,022
Seriously?

459
00:29:49,024 --> 00:29:51,074
Seriously?
Me, seriously?

460
00:29:51,076 --> 00:29:53,043
We just shared a foxhole,
you and I.

461
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:55,128
We beat back
the Tet offensive,

462
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,831
outrun the --
the rape of Nanking together!

463
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,033
And still you're gonna do me
like this?!

464
00:30:00,035 --> 00:30:01,051
Aah!

465
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,839
Aah!

466
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:09,476
"Band of Brothers"?
"The Pacific"?

467
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:12,145
None of this
means anything to you?

468
00:30:12,147 --> 00:30:17,267
All those motels, you never once
watched HBO, not once?

469
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:20,320
"Girls"?

470
00:30:20,322 --> 00:30:22,072
You're my Marnie, Moose.

471
00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:25,892
A-and Hannah -- she just --
she needs to be loved.

472
00:30:25,894 --> 00:30:27,277
She deserves it.

473
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,831
Don't we all -- you, me --
we deserve to be loved.

474
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:34,451
I deserve to be loved!

475
00:30:34,453 --> 00:30:37,337
I just want to be loved.

476
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:39,789
What?

477
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:43,209
What?

478
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:05,531
Would it be possible,
Moose...

479
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,839
...I'd like...

480
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:19,095
to ask you
a-a favor, Sam.

481
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:26,985
Earlier, when you
were confessing back there...

482
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:32,609
...what did you say?

483
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:42,619
I only ask because,
given my history...

484
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:48,441
...it raises the question...

485
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:53,246
Where do I start...

486
00:31:57,551 --> 00:32:05,174
...to even look for forgiveness?

487
00:32:05,176 --> 00:32:07,293
I mean...

488
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:10,596
How about we start
with this?

489
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,276
I think I found
the Angel trials,

490
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:25,278
but I don't see anything
about a Nephilim

491
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,146
or a Cupid's bow
or anything like that.

492
00:32:27,148 --> 00:32:28,865
Oh, come on, Kev!

493
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:30,450
We're
on the one-yard line here.

494
00:32:30,452 --> 00:32:32,201
Okay, a-and I should have
mentioned this six months ago,

495
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:35,088
but the sports metaphors --
y-you want to motivate me,

496
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,656
"Magic" cards,
"Skyrim," Aziz Ansari.

497
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:45,598
I'm not here to fight you,
Castiel.

498
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,665
Dean?

499
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:47,600
Not anymore.

500
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:48,685
Dean?

501
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:49,886
Where is Metatron?

502
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:52,689
He told you he was going to fix
Heaven, didn't he?

503
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:56,642
Murdering a Nephilim,
cutting off a Cupid's bow --

504
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:59,645
it's a lie, all of it.

505
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:00,679
I've been in his head.

506
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:02,681
You've been
in <i>all</i> our heads.

507
00:33:02,683 --> 00:33:05,368
That's the problem.
No, Castiel, you're wrong.

508
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,788
This is what you do.

509
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,990
You twist things.

510
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:12,909
I'm trying to fix Heaven.

511
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:15,244
Metatron is trying
to fix Heaven.

512
00:33:15,246 --> 00:33:17,663
Metatron isn't trying
to fix anything.

513
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:19,165
He's trying to break it --

514
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,567
an act of revenge
for driving him away.

515
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:23,052
Break it how?

516
00:33:23,054 --> 00:33:24,420
Dean.

517
00:33:24,422 --> 00:33:30,376
Expel all Angels from Heaven,
just as God cast out Lucifer.

518
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:33,396
Cast you out to where?
Hell?

519
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:35,982
Here.

520
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:38,217
Thousands of us,
walking the Earth.

521
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:39,385
Lies.
Wait!

522
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:47,560
Our mission was to protect
what God created.

523
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:50,530
I don't know
when we forgot that.

524
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:57,570
I want nothing more than to see
you shut the Gates of Hell,

525
00:33:57,572 --> 00:34:00,423
but I told you
that you could trust me.

526
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:05,912
If Sam completes those trials,
he is going to die.

527
00:34:05,914 --> 00:34:08,097
What the hell
are you talking about?

528
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,266
I saw it
in Metatron's head.

529
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:15,471
It was always God's intention --
the ultimate sacrifice.

530
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:22,562
As for you, Castiel,
I beg of you, stop this path.

531
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:25,064
Metatron
has been neutralized.

532
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:30,503
If you want back in,
truly, I will listen.

533
00:34:37,294 --> 00:34:39,295
Hey, right now, talk to me.

534
00:34:39,297 --> 00:34:40,630
Is she lying?

535
00:34:40,632 --> 00:34:41,881
I don't know.

536
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:42,748
Well, find out!

537
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,584
She's lying.
Take me to him.

538
00:34:44,586 --> 00:34:46,219
Dean --
take me to him now!

539
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:52,558
<i>Exorcizamus te,</i>
<i>omnis immundus spiritus,</i>

540
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,096
<i>hanc animam redintegra,</i>
<i>lustra.</i>

541
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:09,842
Dean, I'm not wrong.

542
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:11,327
I'm going to fix my home.

543
00:35:13,114 --> 00:35:14,330
Cass!

544
00:35:19,653 --> 00:35:21,120
Sammy, stop!

545
00:35:32,182 --> 00:35:34,833
She told you I lied,
didn't she?

546
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,837
You should've listened
to the bitch.

547
00:35:48,948 --> 00:35:50,948
Easy there. Okay.

548
00:35:51,677 --> 00:35:53,793
Just take it easy.
We got a slight change of plan.

549
00:35:53,794 --> 00:35:56,711
What?
What's going on?

550
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:58,429
Where's Cass?!
Metatron lied.

551
00:35:58,431 --> 00:36:02,300
You finish this trial,
you're dead, Sam.

552
00:36:07,422 --> 00:36:09,474
So?

553
00:36:12,194 --> 00:36:13,478
You promised.

554
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,263
Shh!

555
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:21,736
Castiel, I want you to stop
thinking about master plans,

556
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:26,157
Heaven and Angels,
and all this.

557
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,126
That doesn't concern you
anymore.

558
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:36,951
These were never trials,
Castiel.

559
00:36:36,953 --> 00:36:38,753
This is a spell.

560
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:41,973
And what I'm taking
from you now --

561
00:36:41,975 --> 00:36:44,309
your essence, your Grace --

562
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:47,312
is the last piece.

563
00:36:53,436 --> 00:36:59,140
And now something wonderful
is going to happen,

564
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:02,443
for me and for you.

565
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:06,915
I want you to live this new life
to the fullest.

566
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:08,833
Find a wife.

567
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:10,118
Make babies.

568
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,821
And when you die
and your soul comes to Heaven,

569
00:37:13,823 --> 00:37:15,723
find me.

570
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:18,593
Tell me your story.

571
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:21,095
Hmm?

572
00:37:21,097 --> 00:37:23,047
Now go.

573
00:37:25,684 --> 00:37:27,135
Look at him.

574
00:37:27,137 --> 00:37:30,188
Look at him!
Look how close we are!

575
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,358
Other people will die
if I don't finish this!

576
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,460
Think about it.

577
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:38,730
Think about
what we know, huh?

578
00:37:38,732 --> 00:37:41,749
Pulling souls from hell,
curing demons,

579
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:44,285
hell,
ganking a Hellhound!

580
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:48,022
We have enough knowledge on
our side to turn the tide here.

581
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:49,523
But I can't do it
without you.

582
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:52,360
You can barely do it
<i>with</i> me.

583
00:37:52,362 --> 00:37:54,796
I mean, you think I screw up
everything I try.

584
00:37:54,798 --> 00:37:56,414
You think I need a chaperone,
remember?

585
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,333
Come on, man.
That's not what I meant.

586
00:37:58,335 --> 00:38:00,701
No, it's exactly
what you meant.

587
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,306
You want to know
what I confessed in there?

588
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:07,342
What my greatest sin was?

589
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:11,763
It was how many times
I let you down.

590
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:16,184
I can't do that again.

591
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:17,485
Sam --

592
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:20,388
What happens when you've decided
I can't be trusted again?

593
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,658
I mean, who are you gonna
turn to next time instead of me?

594
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,744
Another angel, another --

595
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:28,212
another vampire?

596
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:31,582
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

597
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:34,068
to watch your brother just --
Hold on, hold on!

598
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:37,956
You seriously think that?

599
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:42,910
Because none of it --
none of it -- is true.

600
00:38:42,912 --> 00:38:45,463
Listen, man, I know we've had
our disagreements, okay?

601
00:38:45,465 --> 00:38:48,749
Hell, I know I've said some junk
that set you back on your heels.

602
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:52,270
But, Sammy...come on.

603
00:38:53,605 --> 00:38:55,723
I killed Benny
to save you.

604
00:38:55,725 --> 00:38:57,775
I'm willing
to let this bastard

605
00:38:57,777 --> 00:39:01,112
and all the sons of bitches that
killed mom walk because of you.

606
00:39:01,114 --> 00:39:05,233
Don't you dare think that there
is anything, past or present,

607
00:39:05,235 --> 00:39:07,068
that I would put
in front of you!

608
00:39:08,654 --> 00:39:11,072
It has never been like that,
ever!

609
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:13,408
I need you to see that.

610
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,793
I'm begging you.

611
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:24,785
How do I stop?

612
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:28,756
Just let it go.

613
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:30,124
I can't.
It's in me, Dean.

614
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:31,926
You don't know
what this feels like.

615
00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:37,065
Hey, listen,
we will figure it out, okay,

616
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:39,434
just like we always do.

617
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:41,686
Come on.

618
00:39:43,156 --> 00:39:45,189
Come on. Let it go, okay?

619
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:47,158
Let it go, brother.

620
00:39:50,312 --> 00:39:53,314
Hey, Dean.

621
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,869
See?

622
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:00,538
Aah!
Sam?

623
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:04,425
I got you, little brother.
You're gonna be just fine.

624
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:06,878
Sam, Sam?

625
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,330
Cass?!

626
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:10,664
Castiel?!

627
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,833
Where the hell are you?

628
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:46,134
Sammy!

629
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,947
No, Cass.

630
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:37,596
What's happening?

631
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:45,348
Angels.

632
00:41:49,514 --> 00:41:51,314
They're falling.

633
