1
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:06,153
Takes a painful long time
to bleed out from the gut.

2
00:00:06,154 --> 00:00:07,736
You can do whatever you want,
Crowley.

3
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:09,206
Metatron -- he's an angel.

4
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:11,123
He's the scribe of God.

5
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:13,261
This is Metatron.
<i>This</i> is Metatron?

6
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,029
I'm not one of them.
I'm not an Archangel.

7
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:16,914
I worked
in the secretarial pool

8
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,533
before God chose me
to take down the Word.

9
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:26,240
I've got it.
The third trial.

10
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:28,476
What is it?
To cure a demon.

11
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:35,433
Cass?!
A little help here.

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,435
Abaddon. She's a demon...

13
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,854
Who, it turns out,
is a knight of Hell.

14
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:42,440
Knights of Hell are
handpicked by Lucifer himself.

15
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:46,560
The Demon Trap in your noggin is
gonna keep you from smoking out.

16
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:48,296
We're gonna cut you
into little steaks

17
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,031
and bury each strip
under cement.

18
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:10,384
I can't believe you finally
came up here with me.

19
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:11,636
Why wouldn't I?

20
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,355
I love this place.

21
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:18,059
It's like...I can breathe,
you know?

22
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:23,931
Tommy  you okay?

23
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:27,201
Aah!

24
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:32,623
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.

25
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,629
Did you hear that?

26
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,914
What?

27
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,949
The growl?

28
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:44,802
No.
Maybe it's a bear.

29
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,122
Shelly, get back!

30
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:50,925
Baby, what is wrong?

31
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:52,960
It's not a bear.
It's a Wendigo.

32
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,317
Aah!

33
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,068
Hide in the bedroom.
Right now.

34
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,270
Hide, Shelly!

35
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,105
Tommy,
I don't hear anything.

36
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:06,640
What are you doing?

37
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:08,693
I'm gonna light his ugly ass
on fire.

38
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:09,861
Get back.

39
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,115
Aah!

40
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:15,199
Aah!

41
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,869
Aah.

42
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,989
Aah!

43
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:23,424
Aah!

44
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:27,879
What's...H-happening?

45
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,263
Tommy!

46
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:33,768
Aah!

49
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:49,483
Please tell me that's everything.
Yeah.

50
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,852
No, not even close.

51
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:53,738
You see, the Men of Letters
kept files

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,374
on every demonic possession
for the last 300 years,

53
00:02:56,376 --> 00:03:01,212
I mean, we've got Borden, Lizzy,
all the way to Crane, Ichabod.

54
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,334
Aah.

55
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:08,085
How you feeling?

56
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,638
Honestly, um...

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,174
My, uh,
my whole body hurts.

58
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:17,595
I feel nauseous and like I'm
starving at the same time,

59
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:21,148
and everything smells like
rotting meat.

60
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,217
I've had that hangover.

61
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,969
Jager, man.

62
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,322
Maybe you should, uh,
take a break, get some air.

63
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:29,807
Dean, the only thing
that's gonna make me feel better

64
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,577
is finishing this.
All right.

65
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,329
Well, I'll go get you some grub,
keep your strength up.

66
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,199
Morning.

67
00:03:41,903 --> 00:03:44,338
I like this bunker.

68
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,923
It's orderly.

69
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,925
Oh,
give us a few months.

70
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,877
Dean wants to get
a ping-pong table.

71
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,963
I've heard of that.
It's a game, right?

72
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,418
Are you okay?

73
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,888
My wound isn't healing
as quickly as I'd hoped...

74
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,723
But I am getting better.

75
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:06,944
And you're getting worse.

76
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,764
Well, two trials down,
one to go.

77
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:14,118
And the final test,
do you -- you know what it is?

78
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,070
I have to cure a Demon.

79
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,072
Of what?

80
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:20,875
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

81
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:22,443
Soup's on.

82
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:29,583
There we go.

83
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:32,503
I think this is, uh...

84
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,122
Oh,
it's still good.

85
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:39,176
A half-drunk beer, jerky,
and three peanut-butter cups?

86
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,228
Yeah, we're --
we're running a little low.

87
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,465
I'll make a run.

88
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,734
Dean,
I can go with you.

89
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:51,188
Dean.

90
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,773
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,444
For what?

92
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:00,281
For everything.

93
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:02,283
Everything?

94
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:05,636
Like, uh...
Like ignoring us?

95
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:08,339
Yes.

96
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,758
Or like bolting off
with the Angel Tablet,

97
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,994
then losing it
'cause you didn't trust me?

98
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:15,713
You didn't trust <i>me.</i>

99
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,265
Yes.

100
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,451
Yeah.

101
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,803
Nah,
that's not gonna cut it.

102
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:24,004
Not this time.

103
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,175
So you can take your little apology
and you cram it up your ass.

104
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:33,030
Dean, I thought I was doing
the right thing.

105
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:36,117
Yeah, you always do.

106
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:42,156
Hey, uh,
do we have a room 7B?

107
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:50,364
Dude, go easy on Cass,
okay.

108
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:51,549
He's
one of the good guys.

109
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,169
Dude, if anybody else --
I mean <i>anybody</i> --

110
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:56,303
pulled that kind of crap,

111
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:58,089
I would stab them in their neck
on principle.

112
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,840
Why should I give him
a free pass?

113
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:04,528
Because it's Cass.

114
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,398
What are we supposed to be
looking for down here?

115
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,934
Um,
anything on case 1138.

116
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,737
It was
a class 5 infernal event --

117
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,706
St. Louis, March 8, 1957.

118
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,109
"Class 5 infernal event"?

119
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,945
Yeah. See, the Letters have
this whole rating system.

120
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,197
"The Exorcist"
would have been a class 2.

121
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,283
All right, so, what makes
this puppet show so special?

122
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,568
It was weird.

123
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,452
Weird how?

124
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,703
No clue.

125
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:32,373
One of the files just had a note
written in the margin

126
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,624
about room 7B

127
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,794
and the word "weird"
with three exclamation points.

128
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,245
Good times.

129
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,746
Yeah.

130
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,604
Hmm.

131
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:49,023
Got it.

132
00:06:57,482 --> 00:07:00,234
Sammy, check this out.

133
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,038
Whoa.

134
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:08,876
Is that a Devil's Trap?

135
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:11,445
It takes up
half the room.

136
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:24,058
These chains -- they have
spellwork etched into them.

137
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:28,762
So we have a dungeon.

138
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:31,599
Finally.

139
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:35,319
What do you got there?

140
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:45,446
Movie night?

141
00:07:56,157 --> 00:07:59,710
Simon, we're filming.

142
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:04,348
<i>Um, hello, world.</i>

143
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,166
So this new ritual
<i>we're going to see,</i>

144
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:08,702
this new type of exorcism,
<i>h-how does it work?</i>

145
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,900
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>It's my first time.</i>

146
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:30,958
Wait,
is that Abaddon?

147
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,244
<i>Aah! Aah!</i>

148
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,828
It's not killy enough.

149
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,164
It's got to be the, uh,
the chick she possessed.

150
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:50,711
<i>Hurry.</i>
<i>We must do it now.</i>

151
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:58,385
<i>Dead! They're all dead!</i>

152
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:01,605
<i>Everyone you ever loved...</i>

153
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,408
Hey, those chains look exactly
like the ones in our dungeon.

154
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,509
In your <i>what?</i>

155
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,078
Demon on a leash --
cool.

156
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,118
<i>Aah! Aah! Aah!</i>

157
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:31,752
<i>Exorcizamus te,</i>
<i>omnis immundus spiritus...</i>

158
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:35,856
<i>hanc animam redintegra...</i>

159
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,260
<i>Lustra!</i>

160
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:42,029
<i>Lustra!</i>

161
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,599
<i>She's dead.</i>

162
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:54,041
<i>Where's the demon?</i>

163
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:57,077
<i>Stop filming.</i>

164
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:59,330
<i>What happened?</i>

165
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,798
<i>Will you just stop?!</i>

166
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,024
Well, that was weird...

167
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,226
With
three exclamation points.

168
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:14,795
That wasn't
a normal exorcism.

169
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:17,331
They changed the words.

170
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:21,268
I believe "lustra"
is Latin for wash or cleanse.

171
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,270
Oh, yeah, 'cause that was
the most freaky thing

172
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:24,488
was the vocabulary.

173
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,908
What about the bloody high five
or the chest burster?

174
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,362
Anything else on the film,
like director's commentary,

175
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,363
sequel, maybe?

176
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,781
Yeah, listen to this.

177
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:37,334
The older priest, Max Thompson,
bit the dust in '58,

178
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:41,822
but the younger one is still
alive and still in St. Louis.

179
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,657
Think this kind of weird
is worth the drive?

180
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,509
Dean,
everything in those folders --

181
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,544
the possessions,
the deals, all of it --

182
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,463
we've seen that before,
but that --

183
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:52,833
That was all new.

184
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:54,268
Yeah,
it's worth the drive.

185
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,335
All right. Let's roll.

186
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:58,138
Not you.

187
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,190
Sam is more damaged
than I am.

188
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:04,111
Yeah, well, you know, even
banged up, Sammy comes through.

189
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,513
Dean, I just want to help.
We don't need your help.

190
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:11,702
Just stay here
and -- and get better.

191
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:18,459
Father Thompson had
some unorthodox ideas,

192
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:20,341
which is why the Men of Letters
were interested.

193
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:25,031
Unorthodox how?

194
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:28,702
What exactly do you mean,
"saved"?

195
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:33,006
A demon is a human soul,
twisted and corrupted

196
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:34,875
by its time in Hell.

197
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:39,096
Father Thompson believed that
you could wash that taint away

198
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,065
and restore their humanity.

199
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,066
So, what, they just stay

200
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,734
in whatever schmuck
they're possessing

201
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,270
and -- and get a ticket
upstairs?

202
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,555
I wish I knew.

203
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:52,693
Okay, but this --
this ritual...

204
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,945
Can cure a demon?

205
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,114
I suppose, if it worked,

206
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:01,502
but that night,
something went terribly wrong.

207
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:03,921
The Demon escaped
into the world,

208
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,957
and that poor old woman...

209
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,309
It was horrible.

210
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,679
I know father Thompson
kept trying.

211
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:16,934
There were other possessions,
experiments,

212
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:21,021
but I couldn't face that --
not again.

213
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:26,076
And then,
a few months later...

214
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,611
He was dead.

215
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,862
How'd that happen?

216
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:33,099
Something tore him apart.

217
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:39,940
Did he keep any,
uh

218
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:43,160
Did he keep records
or --

219
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:53,954
Uh  do you have
a-a bathroom, maybe?

220
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,091
Thanks.

221
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:06,150
Is he all right?

222
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,102
Uh, no, padre.

223
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:12,489
He's...pretty damn far
from all right.

224
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,441
That's why we're here.

225
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:15,993
I don't understand.

226
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,911
Well, short story is,
uh, Sammy there

227
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:19,813
is gonna take
whatever shredded your friend

228
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,748
and every other black-eyed bitch
out there,

229
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,251
and he's gonna get rid of them
for good.

230
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:26,453
<i>He</i> is?

231
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:28,956
In his condition?

232
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:32,325
Father,
over the past couple of months,

233
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,962
I've seen him do crap that I
didn't even think was possible.

234
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:37,548
I mean, sure,
he's miserable and he's hurting,

235
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,549
but you know what?

236
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,033
There's not a doubt
in my mind

237
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:43,353
that he's gonna cross
that finish line -- not one.

238
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,473
So, will you help us?

239
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:49,977
I'll get father Thompson's
things for you.

240
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:52,345
Thank you.

241
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:31,318
Dude.

242
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:39,409
<i>Dude.</i>

243
00:14:44,522 --> 00:14:45,922
Dude!

244
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:46,657
I -- I have money.

245
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,831
Where's the pie?

246
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,833
I think we're out.

247
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,703
You don't understand.

248
00:14:59,705 --> 00:15:01,672
I need pie.

249
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,461
Put the virgin down,
Castiel.

250
00:15:09,297 --> 00:15:11,415
We need to talk.

251
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:20,315
You're Metatron?

252
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:21,867
<i>The</i> Metatron?

253
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:23,119
Yes.

254
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:28,633
In public, it's Marv.

255
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:30,151
Marv.

256
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:31,770
And you're Castiel.

257
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:34,923
Kevin Tran
told me about you.

258
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,441
He did?
Yeah.

259
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:38,476
According to him,
you and I have a lot in common.

260
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:40,445
We're both free thinkers.

261
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,681
We're both
on heaven's most wanted list.

262
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:45,333
I thought we could socialize,
maybe grab a bite.

263
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:47,318
I'm sorry --
we can...What?

264
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,538
Look,
I've been on sabbatical.

265
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,323
I'm trying
to play catch-up,

266
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:55,210
but I have to talk to somebody
about what's going on back home.

267
00:15:55,212 --> 00:15:58,763
And by home, you mean heaven?
Right.

268
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,231
I've been looking around,

269
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:03,218
crawling through
a few divine nooks and crannies,

270
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,186
and from what I can see,

271
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:08,106
without the Archangels,
it's a mess up there.

272
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:09,140
Open warfare.

273
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:12,861
I thought Naomi
was running things now.

274
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:14,896
Is that what she told you?

275
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:17,482
I mean,
Naomi's a player --

276
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:20,218
don't get me wrong --
just one of many.

277
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,737
There are factions
upon factions,

278
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:25,373
all fighting,
betraying each other.

279
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,791
It's just a matter of time

280
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:29,490
before they start ripping
each other apart.

281
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:30,703
It's all broken.

282
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,698
I know, I'm the one
who broke it.

283
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,799
There was a time when I thought
I could lead our people,

284
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,835
but I was mistaken.

285
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:39,504
I spilled
so much blood.

286
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:47,448
And I've tried to atone
for my sins and I did penance.

287
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,845
And I
betrayed my friends

288
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:50,979
to protect our secrets,

289
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:52,814
but I've just failed.

290
00:16:52,816 --> 00:16:54,015
And now --

291
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:55,066
Look, I know.

292
00:16:55,068 --> 00:17:00,271
But now the angels --
heaven --

293
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:03,524
need someone
to come to the rescue.

294
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:04,692
They need us.

295
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:07,111
Us?
Yeah. Just -- just picture it.

296
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:10,665
We ride to the rescue,
save the day --

297
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,667
make a great story.

298
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:18,956
Look, the angels are like
a big, dysfunctional family.

299
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,826
We need to lock them all
in a room

300
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:24,161
until we work
these problems out --

301
00:17:24,163 --> 00:17:25,880
all the factions,
you, me --

302
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:27,832
what,
like a big family meeting?

303
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:29,667
Exactly.

304
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:33,438
Which is why we have to
shut down heaven.

305
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,355
What?

306
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:37,642
Do you like crepes?

307
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:40,511
Wait --
Eugenie's in Ojai

308
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:43,731
makes the greatest
caramel apple crepes.

309
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:46,350
Metatron -- Marv.

310
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:54,677
I can't find Cass.

311
00:17:54,678 --> 00:17:55,867
You think he blew town?

312
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:57,128
Sounds like him.

313
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:59,195
So it turns out that, uh,

314
00:17:59,197 --> 00:18:02,415
Father Thompson recorded
all of his demon-cure tests.

315
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:05,385
This one here,
this was the last one --

316
00:18:05,387 --> 00:18:07,187
two days before he died.

317
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:13,309
<i>The date is August 3, 1958.</i>

318
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:16,929
<i>This is trial 19, hour 1.</i>

319
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:20,400
My subject is Peter Kent.

320
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:25,705
Mr. Kent is the father
of two young sons,

321
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:30,126
and three weeks ago,
he was possessed by a demon.

322
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,901
I'm going to
ask you a question now.

323
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:45,458
When you crawled into Mr. Kent
and ate his children,

324
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,143
how did it feel?

325
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:50,513
Orgasmic.

326
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:56,348
Aah!

327
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:01,741
<i>The first dose</i>
<i>has been administered.</i>

328
00:19:01,743 --> 00:19:05,078
Do we know what padre was dosing
number-one dad up with?

329
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:08,531
Uh, yeah,
his own purified blood.

330
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,617
Purified how?

331
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:11,618
Before he started,

332
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,336
Father Thompson
went to confession.

333
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:17,123
<i>This is trial 19, hour 2.</i>

334
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,010
When you ate his children,
how did it feel?

335
00:19:21,012 --> 00:19:22,295
Stringy!

336
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:24,764
Aah!

337
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:27,517
<i>The second dose</i>
<i>has been administered.</i>

338
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,168
<i>Hour 4.</i>

339
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,687
When you ate
his children --

340
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:32,338
Kiss my ass!

341
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,357
How did it feel?
Soft.

342
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:37,193
Aaaah!

343
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:39,696
<i>The sixth dose</i>
<i>has been administered.</i>

344
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:40,613
Stop.

345
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:42,181
How...
Please.

346
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:43,533
Aah!

347
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:45,685
...did it...

348
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,353
Aah! Aah!

349
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:48,371
...feel?

350
00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:51,991
Stop!!

351
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:08,558
<i>Hour 8,</i>
<i>the subject is prepped.</i>

352
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:12,095
Aah! Aah!

353
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:22,739
<i>Exorcizamus te,</i>
<i>omnis immundus spiritus.</i>

354
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:28,528
<i>Hanc animam redintegra,</i>
<i>lustra!</i>

355
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,663
<i>Lustra!</i>

356
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:44,510
When you ate his children,
how did it feel?

357
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:45,929
They were screaming...

358
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:48,848
and I laughed.

359
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,500
Why did I laugh?

360
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:52,251
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

361
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:54,420
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

362
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:55,921
God, I was a monster.

363
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,808
But now you are a man
again.

364
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,028
<i>And you have been saved.</i>

365
00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:09,085
Did he just...
Cure a demon?

366
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:10,536
Maybe.

367
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:13,606
Could we take this hoodoo
on a test drive?

368
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:16,709
Um, I mean,
I have the exorcism right here.

369
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:20,613
All we need is the blood,
consecrated ground, and a demon.

370
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,131
So, what?
We summon a demon, trap it --

371
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:25,418
Or -- or we use one
that we've already tagged.

372
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,572
Do we still have dad's
old army field surgeon's kit?

373
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:31,391
It's in the trunk.
Why?

374
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:33,142
Yeah, I think it's time
we put humpty dumpty

375
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:35,061
back together again.

376
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,687
Why did you leave?

377
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:47,824
I can't have this conversation
on an empty stomach.

378
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:49,325
Here you go.

379
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:50,443
Thank you.

380
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:51,444
Can I get you anything?

381
00:21:51,446 --> 00:21:52,996
Coffee, please.

382
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:54,697
Sure. Cool coat.

383
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:57,617
No,
it's actually quite warm.

384
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:01,487
Cute <i>and</i> funny -- okay.

385
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,878
I should have picked
a better-looking vessel.

386
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,930
What did you mean,
we can shut down Heaven?

387
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:14,550
Oh, you know,
the trials --

388
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:17,136
God's little
"pull in case of emergency""

389
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:19,022
the Leviathans
get out of control,

390
00:22:19,024 --> 00:22:20,973
you put them in Purgatory.

391
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:25,611
Demons get a little too demonic,
toss 'em into Hell.

392
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:28,781
Angels get uppity,
slam the pearly gates.

393
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:32,685
Are you saying you know
the trials to close heaven?

394
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:35,071
I wrote 'em down.

395
00:22:35,073 --> 00:22:37,457
It's not something
you forget.

396
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:40,993
Look,
I think a little alone time

397
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:42,378
would be good
for the angels.

398
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,963
At the very least,
it would s--

399
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,684
It would stop the fighting
up there

400
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:51,671
from spilling out down here,
which will happen.

401
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:53,222
It always does.

402
00:22:53,224 --> 00:22:54,841
You're gonna complete
these tests?

403
00:22:54,843 --> 00:22:57,193
No.

404
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:58,644
I can't.

405
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:04,183
I am a pencil pusher,
always have been.

406
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:05,685
I'm not strong enough.

407
00:23:05,687 --> 00:23:09,689
But you --
you are a warrior.

408
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:12,942
I've got the plan.

409
00:23:12,944 --> 00:23:15,561
You've got the muscle.

410
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:17,196
We can do this.

411
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:20,817
Heaven needs your help,
Castiel.

412
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:23,102
I <i>am</i> the one
that caused these problems.

413
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:25,037
I should be the one
to fix them.

414
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,074
But you understand this is,
um, not going to be easy.

415
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:31,294
I understand.

416
00:23:31,296 --> 00:23:32,745
No, you don't.

417
00:23:33,597 --> 00:23:36,015
See our waitress?

418
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:44,423
She's the first trial --
got to cut her heart out.

419
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:45,274
What?

420
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:47,176
No, she's...

421
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:49,362
She's just a girl.

422
00:23:49,364 --> 00:23:51,030
No, she isn't.

423
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:54,433
She's a Nephilim,
an abomination.

424
00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:56,953
She's the offspring
of an angel and a human?

425
00:23:56,955 --> 00:23:59,872
I thought that wasn't allowed.
It's not.

426
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:04,544
There's only one on Earth,
and you are looking at it.

427
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:08,447
But she didn't choose to be
a Nephilim, so she's innocent.

428
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:09,415
Yes, she is.

429
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:12,084
I told you
it wasn't gonna be easy.

430
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:14,587
But if you want to do this,
Castiel,

431
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:16,672
if you <i>really</i> want to
do this,

432
00:24:16,674 --> 00:24:19,642
you got to ask yourself
what's more important --

433
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:23,346
her life or your family?

434
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,605
So you really think
this will work?

435
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:35,158
Dude, we got needles.
We got thread.

436
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,493
We've seen "Young Frankenstein"
about a thousand times.

437
00:24:37,495 --> 00:24:38,778
Yeah, we're golden.

438
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,663
Ugh.

439
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,285
This is
gonna be disgusting.

440
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:47,920
Uh-huh.

441
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:25,476
Morning, sunshines.

442
00:25:25,478 --> 00:25:27,128
It worked.

443
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:29,364
You owe me a beer.

444
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:33,418
And I owe you both
so, so much.

445
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,654
I can't wait to tear out
those pretty green eyes.

446
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:40,391
Good luck with that.

447
00:25:40,393 --> 00:25:43,394
We figured kitty
didn't need her claws.

448
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:49,300
Then I'll stump you to death.
It'll be swell.

449
00:25:50,954 --> 00:25:52,537
Yeah, that's not gonna happen,
either.

450
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:54,539
The bullet -- remember?

451
00:25:57,711 --> 00:25:59,827
So you sit there
like a good little bitch.

452
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:02,330
We're gonna consecrate
the ground,

453
00:26:02,332 --> 00:26:03,748
and you're gonna get
to fessing up.

454
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,250
Oh, I know this tune.
I doubt that.

455
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:10,972
Father Max Thompson,
born October 12, 1910.

456
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:13,174
Died August 5, 1958.

457
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:16,077
Who do you think
ripped him apart?

458
00:26:17,262 --> 00:26:18,963
Word got back
to home office

459
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:21,332
that Maxie
was messing with things,

460
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:23,401
so we made an example.

461
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:27,005
It wasn't my most artful kill,
but it was effective.

462
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:29,173
And bonus --

463
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:31,859
before he died, he told me
all about Josie Sands.

464
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:35,146
I found her, and I rode her
into the Men of Letters.

465
00:26:35,148 --> 00:26:38,232
And what I did
to them, that was art.

466
00:26:38,234 --> 00:26:39,701
So you know
what Max was doing?

467
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:43,054
Fella screamed
the basics...

468
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:44,489
But it'll never work.

469
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:45,940
You keep telling yourself
that.

470
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:56,517
Hello, boy.

471
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:58,453
Crowley.

472
00:26:58,455 --> 00:27:00,304
Crowley?

473
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,807
The salesman?

474
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:04,108
Try the King of Hell.

475
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,144
This is a joke, right?

476
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:10,531
Stay.

477
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,040
Hold on.

478
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:21,576
How'd you get this number?

479
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:23,327
Ah, first things first --

480
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:25,029
what are you wearing?

481
00:27:25,031 --> 00:27:26,547
Oh, okay,
hanging up now. Hang up.

482
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,866
Fine.
This isn't a social call.

483
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:30,134
I was wondering.

484
00:27:30,136 --> 00:27:32,754
You lads been reading
the papers,

485
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:36,641
say, <i>Denver Times</i>
from yesterday?

486
00:27:36,643 --> 00:27:37,675
No?

487
00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:40,878
Well, you should.
It's side-splitting.

488
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,036
What the hell --
I'm sexting you an address.

489
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:06,170
Check it out.

490
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:08,906
Then we'll talk.
Cheerio.

491
00:28:08,908 --> 00:28:11,292
Wait, what?

492
00:28:11,294 --> 00:28:12,326
Crowley?

493
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:44,876
Here it is.
Vic's name is Tommy Collins.

494
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:46,461
Tommy.
Why do I know that name?

495
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:47,628
Well, Tommy Collins,

496
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,797
we saved him from a Wendigo
like forever ago.

497
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,583
Okay, and, what, you think
that Crowley blew his head off?

498
00:28:52,585 --> 00:28:54,451
Well,
what are we dealing with here?

499
00:28:54,453 --> 00:28:56,304
Some sort
of Demon-Wendigo team-up?

500
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:58,622
Uh, no clue.

501
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:00,664
All right, well, we'll
pour one out for Tommy later.

502
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:03,928
As far as Crowley goes,
screw him.

503
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,631
We got everything we need to put
him in a permanent time-out.

504
00:29:10,068 --> 00:29:15,323
No.
No! No! No! No!

505
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:16,524
She's gone.

506
00:29:16,526 --> 00:29:19,777
She's -- son of a bitch!

507
00:29:35,627 --> 00:29:37,962
Dean!

508
00:29:40,884 --> 00:29:42,383
It's a text message
from Crowley --

509
00:29:42,385 --> 00:29:45,319
an address
in Prosperity, Indiana.

510
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:46,554
Prosperity?

511
00:29:46,556 --> 00:29:48,306
Didn't we work
a case there?

512
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:51,175
Yeah, yeah, the one with
the witches and the baked goods.

513
00:29:51,177 --> 00:29:53,394
So what? He's going
after somebody there now?

514
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:54,312
I don't know.

515
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:55,897
We got to check it out.

516
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:58,282
Well, you know it's a trap.
Of course it's a trap.

517
00:29:58,284 --> 00:30:01,986
But a trap means demons,
and we could use one right now.

518
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:41,659
Sam.

519
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:48,332
Is that...Jenny?

520
00:30:57,075 --> 00:30:59,594
You were a great gal,
Jenny Klein.

521
00:31:07,585 --> 00:31:09,971
Hey.

522
00:31:09,973 --> 00:31:10,638
What the hell are you doing,
Crowley?

523
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,224
Dean.
Hey.

524
00:31:13,226 --> 00:31:15,393
Oh, Moosie,
isn't it obvious?

525
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:18,462
I'm killing everyone
you've ever saved --

526
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:22,166
the damsels in distress,
the innocent whippersnappers,

527
00:31:22,168 --> 00:31:25,102
the would-be vampire chow --
all of them.

528
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:26,370
How do you even know --

529
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:29,657
I have my sources
and a cracking research team.

530
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:31,726
When you boys hit a town,

531
00:31:31,728 --> 00:31:34,278
you tend to leave a mess.

532
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,180
Now,
you're probably wondering

533
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:38,883
why my droogs aren't in there
giving you the bum's rush,

534
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:42,336
so let's brass these tacks,
shall we?

535
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:45,339
I'm gonna gut one person
every 12 hours

536
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:47,258
until you bring me
the Demon Tablet

537
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:52,063
and stop
this whole trials nonsense.

538
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:54,382
We don't have the tablet.
Kevin took it and --

539
00:31:54,384 --> 00:31:56,484
I took Kevin.

540
00:31:56,486 --> 00:31:59,570
Then someone took him back.

541
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:02,056
Word from the cloud
is that it wasn't Heaven.

542
00:32:02,058 --> 00:32:04,025
So either
the cutest little Prophet

543
00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:05,693
in the world
is with you two lads,

544
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:09,163
or you better find him
tout-bloody-suite

545
00:32:09,165 --> 00:32:11,866
because time,
she is a-wasting.

546
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:16,404
About now, you're thinking
of ways to stop me.

547
00:32:16,406 --> 00:32:21,258
You won't be able to, but you'll
try because that's what you do.

548
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,162
You -- you try.

549
00:32:25,164 --> 00:32:28,432
So,
time for an object lesson.

550
00:32:28,434 --> 00:32:34,138
Indianapolis,
the Ivy Motel, room 116.

551
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,359
You have 57 minutes.

552
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:49,570
What's it gonna be,
Castiel?

553
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:02,733
Sarah.

554
00:33:02,735 --> 00:33:04,418
Sam?

555
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,670
I'm Sarah Blake.

556
00:33:06,672 --> 00:33:07,805
I'm Sam.

557
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:16,380
What's going on?

558
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:39,292
I know what you are.

559
00:33:39,294 --> 00:33:41,261
I could see your halos.

560
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:44,715
And we know what you are,
abomination.

561
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:48,385
Please, I'm not.

562
00:33:48,387 --> 00:33:50,554
I try to be nice.

563
00:33:50,556 --> 00:33:52,272
I just want to live
my life.

564
00:33:52,274 --> 00:33:54,924
We know.

565
00:33:56,394 --> 00:33:57,894
I am sorry.

566
00:33:59,113 --> 00:34:00,263
You will be.

567
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,830
Having fun?

568
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:33,563
You want an abomination?

569
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:35,932
I'll show you
an abomination.

570
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:56,019
So a demon named Crowley

571
00:34:56,021 --> 00:35:00,924
is gonna kill me
in...16 minutes.

572
00:35:00,926 --> 00:35:02,492
No.

573
00:35:02,494 --> 00:35:05,045
No, he's not.

574
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:17,941
Sarah, long time.

575
00:35:17,943 --> 00:35:20,777
What you doing in Indy?

576
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:25,532
I...was scouting
an estate sale for my dad.

577
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:29,452
Look, we're gonna put
Devil's Traps everywhere --

578
00:35:29,454 --> 00:35:31,154
the windows, the door.

579
00:35:31,156 --> 00:35:32,823
We've got holy water,

580
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:35,458
an exorcism ready to play
on a loop,

581
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,079
and anything that comes
through that door --

582
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:41,998
it's meat.

583
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,051
Look,
I know this is insane,

584
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:47,721
but insane
is kind of what we do.

585
00:35:47,723 --> 00:35:51,057
We'll keep you safe.

586
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:52,976
Okay.

587
00:35:52,978 --> 00:35:55,679
Okay? That's it?

588
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:58,949
You've done it before.

589
00:36:13,114 --> 00:36:15,064
That's new.

590
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:17,901
Yeah, I...

591
00:36:17,903 --> 00:36:19,235
His name is Ian.

592
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:21,705
He works
search and rescue.

593
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:24,457
Guess I have a type.

594
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:28,295
Our daughter, Bess --
she'll be one in a month.

595
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,385
That's, uh, great.

596
00:36:35,387 --> 00:36:36,519
I mean it.

597
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:38,722
I'm really, uh...

598
00:36:38,724 --> 00:36:40,857
I'm really happy for you.

599
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:44,311
Thanks, Sam.

600
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:52,652
And what about you?

601
00:36:52,654 --> 00:36:54,821
Me?

602
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:58,408
Pretty much the same,
I guess.

603
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,793
No, you're not.

604
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:01,661
You're not the same.

605
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:06,066
Look, it's been years,

606
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:10,921
and I can't even imagine
the things you've been through.

607
00:37:10,923 --> 00:37:13,390
But I don't know.

608
00:37:13,392 --> 00:37:18,178
You just seem...more focused,
confident, like...

609
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:21,948
...like you know
what you want.

610
00:37:25,102 --> 00:37:26,736
You grew up, Sam.

611
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:32,409
I <i>do</i> miss the old haircut,
though.

612
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,503
Crowley.

613
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:44,921
Five...

614
00:37:44,923 --> 00:37:46,256
Four...

615
00:37:46,258 --> 00:37:48,675
Trios...

616
00:37:48,677 --> 00:37:49,759
Zwei...

617
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:51,628
...uno.

618
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,054
Sarah! Hey!

619
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:03,690
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Can you hear me?

620
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:04,924
Sarah!

621
00:38:04,926 --> 00:38:08,177
She's dying, and there's
nothing you can do about it.

622
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:09,345
You son of a bitch!

623
00:38:09,347 --> 00:38:11,698
Son of a witch, actually.

624
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,616
My mommy taught me
a few tricks.

625
00:38:13,618 --> 00:38:17,070
It's a spell.
Find the hex bag.

626
00:38:17,072 --> 00:38:19,706
I thought of sending in
a few of my bruisers,

627
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,409
really letting them
go to town.

628
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:26,029
But then, well, trial one
was kill a Hellhound.

629
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:29,249
Trial two was rescue a soul
from the pit.

630
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:33,837
So, from here on, I'm gonna
keep everything hell-related --

631
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,539
demons, et cetera --
away from you.

632
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:38,008
Safe side and all that --

633
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:42,178
plus, I just thought
it seemed fitting.

634
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,649
From what I understand, Sammy
took that bird's breath away.

635
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:49,886
What's the line?

636
00:38:49,888 --> 00:38:54,824
Saving people, hunting things --
the family business.

637
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:58,161
Well,
I think the people you save,

638
00:38:58,163 --> 00:39:03,033
they're how you justify
your pathetic little lives.

639
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:06,569
The alcoholism,
the collateral damage,

640
00:39:06,571 --> 00:39:08,872
the pain you've caused --

641
00:39:08,874 --> 00:39:12,292
the one thing that allows you
to sleep at night,

642
00:39:12,294 --> 00:39:16,730
the one thing is knowing
that these folks are out there,

643
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:21,751
still out there happy
and healthy because of you,

644
00:39:21,753 --> 00:39:25,188
you great, big,
bloody heroes.

645
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,440
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You're gonna be okay.

646
00:39:27,442 --> 00:39:29,225
Sarah?
They're your life's work,

647
00:39:29,227 --> 00:39:33,930
and I'm going to rip it apart
piece by piece

648
00:39:33,932 --> 00:39:37,283
because I can,

649
00:39:37,285 --> 00:39:40,570
because you can't stop me,

650
00:39:40,572 --> 00:39:43,823
and because
when they're all gone,

651
00:39:43,825 --> 00:39:45,708
what will you have left?

652
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,710
No. No, no, no.

653
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,963
No.

654
00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:50,997
No, please, no.

655
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:53,967
You want to keep those people
alive.

656
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:57,003
I want complete
and utter surrender.

657
00:39:57,005 --> 00:40:00,256
The tablet, the trials --
you'll give them up,

658
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:03,159
or we'll keep doing
this dance.

659
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:05,795
Your choice, my darlings.

660
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:47,070
You okay?

661
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:54,577
What do you think?

662
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:56,946
Look, I know
it's bad right now, okay,

663
00:40:56,948 --> 00:40:58,131
but we stick to the plan.

664
00:40:58,133 --> 00:40:59,098
We shut down Hell.

665
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,950
How, exactly?

666
00:41:00,952 --> 00:41:03,169
We get a demon --

667
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:04,170
You heard Crowley.

668
00:41:04,172 --> 00:41:05,955
He's not gonna let one
near us,

669
00:41:05,957 --> 00:41:09,008
and without a demon,
all we can do is sit back

670
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,928
and watch people we know,
people we saved,

671
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,148
die like Sarah.

672
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,482
So what are you saying?

673
00:41:16,484 --> 00:41:21,104
I'm saying...

674
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:23,305
Maybe this isn't
one we can win.

675
00:41:23,307 --> 00:41:25,458
Maybe we should just take
the deal.

676
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:30,329
We'll figure this out.

677
00:41:30,331 --> 00:41:32,265
We will.

678
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:33,700
Man, we'll get it done.

679
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:36,786
We'll kick it in the ass
like we always do.

680
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,592
Are you with me?

681
