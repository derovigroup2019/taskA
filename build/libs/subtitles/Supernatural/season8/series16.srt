1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,741
I figured out
how to close the Gates of Hell.

2
00:00:03,743 --> 00:00:06,877
Basically,
God built a series of tests.

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,413
When you've done all three,
you can slam the Gates.

4
00:00:09,415 --> 00:00:11,749
You need backup.
No, I need you safe, Sam.

5
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:13,951
We both know where this ends --
one of us dies.

6
00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:15,219
I'm gonna do these trials.

7
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:17,087
I'm gonna do them alone --
end of story.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,807
Aah!

9
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,178
Aah!

10
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:26,313
The spell's not gonna work
for you, Dean.

11
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:27,565
Sam,
I didn't pass the test.

12
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,517
But <i>I</i> did...And I'm doing
the rest of them.

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,518
Sam...

14
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:34,939
I'm good. I'm okay.

15
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:36,690
I can do this.

16
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:20,201
Oh, God.

17
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:28,158
Oh, no.

18
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:15,172
Dang it.

19
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,808
Dispatch, Seven-Mary-Four --
you got your ears on?

20
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,593
Go ahead, Seven-Mary-Four.

21
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:37,978
I got a hit and run
on 89.

22
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,480
He's dead.

23
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:41,231
What's the condition
of the body?

24
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:44,368
Looks like he's frozen solid.
Please advise.

25
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,986
Seven-Mary-Four,
please hold your position.

26
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:50,207
We'll send an ambulance
to your location.

27
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:54,128
What the hell...

28
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:17,565

30
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:58,942
What's up with you?

31
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,146
Nothing. Why?

32
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:10,337
Heard from Kevin?

33
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:15,709
Uh, no. Nothing yet.

34
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:17,260
What's it been,
like, three weeks?

35
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:19,212
What's taking that little
brainiac so long?

36
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:21,098
It's a book. Read it.

37
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,550
Just a guess, but translating
an ancient language

38
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:26,169
with zero help might be
more difficult than we think.

39
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,472
So, no word from Cass,

40
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:29,573
Kevin's taking
his sweet little time,

41
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:30,774
and you're acting cagey.

42
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:33,676
We need a lead before I start
climbing these walls.

43
00:04:33,678 --> 00:04:34,844
Well, um...

44
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:40,984
In that case,
I can give you zombies.

45
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:46,790
Guy gets hit by a car,
left for dead overnight,

46
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:49,126
guts spilled out
all over the road,

47
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:50,577
then gets up
and walks away from it.

48
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:51,995
Nothing about
brain munching?

49
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:53,130
Remember Bobby's wife?

50
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:55,832
She didn't...
munch on any brains.

51
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,250
Well, who's the witness?

52
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:59,586
Montana state trooper,
20-year vet.

53
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:00,754
Checked his pulse,

54
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:03,306
saw his insides spilled out
all over the place,

55
00:05:03,308 --> 00:05:05,842
pronounced him dead
with a capital "D."

56
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,076
Since when have the Feds

57
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:24,727
started tracking
zombie activity?

58
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,480
We don't track
zombie activity

59
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,532
because there's no such thing
as zombies.

60
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:29,950
Uh-huh.

61
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:31,701
Why don't you just tell us
what you saw?

62
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:32,869
Article said it all --

63
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:37,724
dead as dog poop,
guts pecked out, face frozen.

64
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:39,526
People don't walk away
from that.

65
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:41,011
Zombies do.

66
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:44,131
And you don't think something
could have dragged him away?

67
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,300
One set of footprints,
no drag marks.

68
00:05:47,302 --> 00:05:49,786
You didn't go after him?
That's grizzly country.

69
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:52,606
You couldn't pay me enough
to hike those woods,

70
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:54,024
not without a bazooka.

71
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:55,592
Uh, Jack?

72
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:57,894
I got something here.

73
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:02,616
Came across the wire
from Livingston.

74
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:06,403
John Doe --
presumably mauled by a grizzly.

75
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:09,105
Holy crap, that's him.

76
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:11,291
That's the dead guy?
Dead my ass.

77
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:13,160
That's a zombie, boys.

78
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:16,129
Uh, you know what,
trooper?

79
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,280
Why don't you stay here?

80
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:18,632
We'll take care
of this one.

81
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:19,916
We need someone
to hold down the fort.

82
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,285
You sure?

83
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,638
Yeah, and if things go
all "Dawn of the Dead" on us,

84
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,922
you'll be our first call.

85
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:29,593
Boys...

86
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:31,478
Aim for the head.

87
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:42,189
No I.D. on this guy?

88
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:44,524
Fingerprints
came up blank, too.

89
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,952
What's going on down here?

90
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:57,087
Liver was eaten.

91
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:59,322
Best guess
is a bird got at it.

92
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:02,592
Hmm.

93
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,212
I got to say,
I am a little disappointed.

94
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:07,347
Yeah, 'cause you wanted
to shoot zombies.

95
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:09,599
Damn straight I wanted
to shoot some zombies.

96
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,302
Look, man, this is about as
open-and-shut as it gets, all right?

97
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:15,222
Guy gets Mack-trucked,
goes down for a nap, wakes up,

98
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:18,108
takes a detour into mama bear's
den -- end of story.

99
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,476
Then why would he run?

100
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:21,177
He was injured.

101
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:22,479
That trooper
could have helped him.

102
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:23,980
I don't know. Shady past?

103
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:26,967
Dean, don't guys
with a shady past

104
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,451
usually have a fingerprint
on file?

105
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:32,189
Whatever it was,
the guy's dead now, all right?

106
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:33,790
Remember
what Bobby said, hmm?

107
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,375
"Wood chipper
beats everything"?

108
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:38,662
Yeah, well,
so does grizzly bear.

109
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,885
You better start talking.

110
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:45,802
What are you?

111
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:47,704
If you say, "zombie,"
I swear --

112
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:49,389
What?!
No, I'm not anything.

113
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:51,207
Look, two minutes ago,
you were room temperature.

114
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,142
You're something.

115
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:54,261
Look, I don't know
what I am, okay?

116
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:55,312
I don't know who I am.

117
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:57,013
All I know
is all I do is die,

118
00:07:57,015 --> 00:07:59,716
so if you want to shoot me,
shoot me.

119
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:01,401
Just promise me
you finish the job,

120
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:03,019
'cause I can't take this
anymore.

121
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:11,695
All right. Get up,
get up, get up. Stand up!

122
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:12,662
All you do is die?

123
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:14,281
What's that
supposed to mean?

124
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:17,400
Once a day,
for as long as I can remember.

125
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:19,619
After a few hours,
I'm back.

126
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:22,305
What are you,
like a real-life Kenny?

127
00:08:22,307 --> 00:08:23,924
Who?

128
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:28,678
No, my name is Shane.

129
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,096
All right,
well, listen, Shane.

130
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:31,598
We're not gonna find out
what the hell you are in here,

131
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,249
so you're gonna
come with us, okay?

132
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,517
We're gonna run a few tests,

133
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,518
make sure
everything's kosher.

134
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,853
Tests?

135
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,357
Seriously?

136
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,726
This is FBI-sanctioned?

137
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:45,228
Drink.

138
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:52,369
All right, so, uh,

139
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:54,120
how long has this dying thing
been going on?

140
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:56,406
As long
as I can remember,

141
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:58,808
but my memory only goes back
a few years.

142
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,794
Wait,
so now you have amnesia?

143
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:02,295
How do you know your name?

144
00:09:02,297 --> 00:09:04,247
My real name isn't Shane.

145
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:06,833
It was given to me
because...

146
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:08,802
I don't know, people had to
call me something.

147
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:10,453
Okay. So, then,
what happened to you?

148
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:12,455
Got pulled off a mountain
in Europe.

149
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:14,841
They said that I got caught
in an avalanche.

150
00:09:14,843 --> 00:09:17,894
I don't remember anything
from before the rescue.

151
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:19,396
When I realized
my condition,

152
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:21,398
I knew I couldn't
be around other people,

153
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,351
so I built a little cabin,
learned to hunt, kept to myself.

154
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:25,769
Seemed easiest that way.

155
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:28,071
Then a couple pot growers
grew nervous

156
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:29,906
with me being
so near their crop.

157
00:09:29,908 --> 00:09:32,108
Shot me -- twice.

158
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,526
I figured it was time
to move on.

159
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:35,662
Right into the grille
of that pickup.

160
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,084
You think maybe I could
clean up?

161
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:44,421
Yeah, man.
Knock yourself out.

162
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,378
Well,
he's definitely something.

163
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,014
Yeah, but maybe
he's not the monster.

164
00:09:54,016 --> 00:09:55,432
Maybe he's the victim.

165
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:56,883
You thinking curse?

166
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,635
Could be looking
for a witch, yeah.

167
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:00,553
You know what?

168
00:10:00,555 --> 00:10:01,805
He's parked here.
He's safe.

169
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:03,390
Maybe we should
just get another room

170
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:04,808
until we can
figure this out.

171
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,859
All right,
but you're the one

172
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:09,396
going full-cavity
for the hex bag.

173
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,830
Who are you?

174
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:49,018
You don't remember.

175
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:52,405
Never mind.

176
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,896
Aah!

177
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:36,199
Who are you?

178
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,707
Now I'm your worst enemy.

179
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:50,947
Who the hell was that?

180
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:54,050
She -- she said
that she knew me.

181
00:11:54,052 --> 00:11:56,219
Yeah, how?

182
00:11:56,221 --> 00:12:00,757
I don't know, but, uh, I could
have sworn that she was upset

183
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,509
I didn't know her back.

184
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:04,260
This is, uh -- this is a lot
more than a curse, man.

185
00:12:04,262 --> 00:12:05,512
You've got, like,
some tiger blood.

186
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:06,813
Where did you learn
that kung fu?

187
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:09,899
Hey, buddy, you okay?

188
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,067
Yeah.

189
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:12,902
Yeah,
I just need a minute.

190
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:15,772
I've never been in a fight
in my whole life.

191
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:20,109
Whoa, hey, hey, pal.

192
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:21,110
Hey. Are you --

193
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,413
Hey, whoa.

194
00:12:23,415 --> 00:12:24,714
Is he having
a heart attack?

195
00:12:24,716 --> 00:12:25,782
Do we call 911?

196
00:12:25,784 --> 00:12:26,866
And tell them what?

197
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:28,251
That the dead guy we stole
from the morgue

198
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:29,786
is alive
and having a coronary?

199
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,326
I feel like
I'm sitting Shiva.

200
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:45,184
Well, that's not --
never mind.

201
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:46,686
Um...We need to think.

202
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:48,721
Dean, what do we know of

203
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:52,108
that has Jason Bourne
fighting skills,

204
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,779
dies a lot, and has a history
with violent women?

205
00:12:56,781 --> 00:12:58,998
I don't know -- you?

206
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,723
May I help you?

207
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:26,009
Agent Bonham?

208
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:28,094
And you are?

209
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:29,862
This is gonna sound
really strange,

210
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:34,233
but I'm looking for a corpse
that went missing today.

211
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:36,536
The coroner said that you were
the last one to see it.

212
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:41,407
I'm Hayley.

213
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:45,628
Uh, this is Agent Jones.

214
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:48,614
Why are you looking
for our John Doe?

215
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,500
Well, his name is Shane.

216
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:54,804
At least,
that's what I called him.

217
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:57,674
I'm the mother of his son.

218
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:02,061
Hey.

219
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:04,964
Why don't you, uh,
slap me some skin, huh?

220
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:06,349
He's shy.

221
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:09,402
It's okay, Oliver.

222
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:12,355
Oh, you weren't
supposed to see --

223
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:13,356
It's okay.

224
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:15,858
Stay with the nice
FBI agents, Oliver.

225
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:19,529
Hey.

226
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:31,174
When I was younger,

227
00:14:31,176 --> 00:14:34,093
I had friends that wanted to
climb this mountain in Europe,

228
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:36,095
and I thought
it sounded exciting,

229
00:14:36,097 --> 00:14:38,381
so...I joined them.

230
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:39,882
The avalanche?

231
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:42,468
He -- he told you?

232
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,054
What else did he say?

233
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:47,724
Just that he doesn't remember
how he got there.

234
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:52,228
My friends were gone,
and when I found him,

235
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,064
his clothes were torn off,
his eyes were frozen solid,

236
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:57,516
but he was still alive.

237
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,820
I just knew there was
something off about him,

238
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:02,205
the way that...he would --

239
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:03,656
Die every day?

240
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:07,577
Yeah.

241
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:10,129
I thought it was
from exposure or shock.

242
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:11,631
Maybe he was unconscious.

243
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,199
We were both in bad shape.

244
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:16,135
And I know I couldn't have
made it down the mountain

245
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:17,553
if it weren't for him.

246
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:22,391
And when we got to the bottom,
we, um...realized

247
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:24,477
that it had become
something else,

248
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,545
and we spent
the night together,

249
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:30,900
and while we were, you know...
He had a heart attack.

250
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:34,520
Awkward.

251
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,391
So, I called 911,
and they couldn't save him.

252
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:42,161
And I had to go down
to I.D. the body...

253
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:43,529
He popped up again.

254
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:44,831
Alive.

255
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,034
I freaked out.
And I ran.

256
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:50,787
And nine months later,
I had Oliver.

257
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,342
I hired
a private investigator.

258
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:57,593
I really tried to find him,

259
00:15:57,595 --> 00:16:00,930
but when they gave up,
I gave up.

260
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,269
Until a couple
of months ago.

261
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:08,137
Now, what made you
look again?

262
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,973
The worst thing.

263
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,985
Hayley?

264
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:27,323
Hello, Shane.

265
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:31,544
Oliver,
come here, honey.

266
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:40,002
I thought it was time
you two meet.

267
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:42,755
This is Oliver.

268
00:16:58,055 --> 00:17:01,357
Did you find anything?

269
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:03,025
Well, uh...

270
00:17:03,027 --> 00:17:05,862
Looks like we were right
about that curse thing.

271
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:09,749
From what I can tell,
we're looking at a Titan.

272
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,251
A Titan?
What is that -- like, a God?

273
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:13,703
More like a proto-God,

274
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:16,155
like the Gods
before the Gods.

275
00:17:16,157 --> 00:17:17,790
They ruled over Greece

276
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,375
before Zeus and the rest
of the Olympian Gods

277
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:20,343
overthrew them.

278
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:23,329
Okay,
so who is this guy?

279
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:25,598
Best I can tell?

280
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,216
Prometheus.

281
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:29,668
Seriously?
Yeah.

282
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:33,389
Well, didn't he --
he steal fire or something?

283
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:34,523
Yep.

284
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:36,142
He, uh, "Ocean's Eleven'd"
Mount Olympus

285
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:38,110
and stole the flames
of Olympia.

286
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:39,562
For what, kicks?

287
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:41,480
For us, actually.

288
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:44,650
Zeus decided to revoke
humanity's ability to make fire

289
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:47,203
so we couldn't cook,
couldn't stay warm,

290
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:48,788
couldn't see in the dark.

291
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,956
Sounds like a monster's
paradise.

292
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,190
And this guy made it right
for us?

293
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:52,191
Yeah.

294
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:53,242
And in return,

295
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,428
Zeus decided to strap him
to that mountain

296
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,630
and make him relive death
every day.

297
00:17:57,632 --> 00:18:00,049
Damn.
Every day for how long?

298
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:02,718
No wonder the guy's hard drive
is fried.

299
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:07,757
Did you figure out
who, uh, Xena-wannabe was?

300
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,725
I'm guessing Artemis,
Zeus' daughter.

301
00:18:09,727 --> 00:18:12,711
She's been known to carry around
weapons like that dagger.

302
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:14,764
They're nasty.
They'll kill Immortals dead.

303
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:15,932
All right.

304
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:19,652
Well, we've never battled
a God curse before.

305
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:21,621
Hope we can break it.

306
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:26,175
This is an eagle
chowing down on your intestines.

307
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:28,277
You don't remember that?

308
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,328
No.

309
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,164
Okay, look,
I hate to break it to you,

310
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,950
but you <i>are</i> Prometheus.

311
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:36,035
Well, then,
the best thing for me

312
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:38,570
is to get as far away from them
as I can.

313
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:39,872
Wait. I'm sorry.

314
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:41,641
You just discovered that you
have a seven-year-old son,

315
00:18:41,643 --> 00:18:42,792
and you want to walk away?

316
00:18:42,794 --> 00:18:43,876
And I'm a God.

317
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:46,012
And this God and his daughter
are hunting me.

318
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:47,213
What chance do I have?

319
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:48,381
Okay.

320
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:49,882
We're gonna help you,

321
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:51,083
but we need a plan first,

322
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:52,802
and we can't
come up with one here.

323
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:54,353
Where are we going?

324
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:55,521
Someplace safe.

325
00:18:57,941 --> 00:18:58,891
What's wrong?

326
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,109
He fell.

327
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:01,444
Do I need to call
an ambulance?

328
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:03,479
No. Don't.

329
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:10,703
He's dying, isn't he?

330
00:19:10,705 --> 00:19:11,787
I was going to tell you,

331
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,956
I just wanted you to have
a chance to adjust.

332
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,375
Wait a second --
he has your curse?

333
00:19:17,494 --> 00:19:18,828
What curse?

334
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:40,123
Just put him right here.

335
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:46,463
This curse was put on you.
Why the kid?

336
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:47,741
I don't know.

337
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:49,543
You keep saying "curse."
What curse?

338
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:51,212
How long has this
been happening?

339
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:53,697
Oh, well, I -- since he turned
seven a few months ago.

340
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:56,250
It started with the dying,
and then he stopped talking.

341
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:57,952
Wait, seven?

342
00:19:57,954 --> 00:20:00,354
Age seven marks one of the first
Greek rites of manhood.

343
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:01,739
So, what?

344
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:04,374
Are you saying the curse is
hardwired into his programming?

345
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:05,559
How do you know that?

346
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:08,145
Look at me.

347
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:10,564
I'm sorry that I ran out on you
all those years ago.

348
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:11,599
I was scared.

349
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:14,185
I didn't understand
what was going on.

350
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:17,571
But we have a child,
and whatever you have, he has.

351
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:19,657
I need to know
how to stop it.

352
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:22,993
What curse?

353
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:30,401
Okay, so Ollie's dad
is a Greek God

354
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:34,371
who has been cursed to die
every day by Zeus.

355
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:38,843
And you guys
are...Ghostbusters.

356
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:40,010
Am I getting this right?

357
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,630
Well, you know,
due to the fact that your son

358
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,465
is currently,
albeit temporarily, dead,

359
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,850
I'm gonna
let that one slide.

360
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:47,701
You have to realize
this sounds crazy.

361
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:49,086
It's true.

362
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:50,471
I didn't believe it myself
at first,

363
00:20:50,473 --> 00:20:51,939
but it's the only thing
that makes sense.

364
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,024
Look, the faster you wrap
your brain around this,

365
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:55,726
the faster we can
solve the problem.

366
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:57,027
Solve the problem?

367
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:59,613
I-I'm just not even sure
I understand the problem.

368
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:01,115
All right.

369
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:02,599
So, the way
we usually handle this

370
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:05,236
is we summon the bastard
and we work him over

371
00:21:05,238 --> 00:21:07,538
until he undoes
whatever it is he did.

372
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,990
Summon Zeus.

373
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:11,125
Yes.

374
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:12,442
And if he doesn't want
to undo it?

375
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:14,545
Then we take him out.

376
00:21:14,547 --> 00:21:18,499
And hopefully,
the curse dies along with him.

377
00:21:20,002 --> 00:21:22,386
This can't be happening.

378
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:27,224
This I can handle.

379
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:36,000
Listen, you can run and hide
and die for all eternity.

380
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:37,001
It's your choice.

381
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:39,270
But Sam and I are gonna
go after Zeus...

382
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:43,190
...with or without you.

383
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:49,363
I'm in.

384
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,606
Here we go.

385
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:16,941
What you got?

386
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:19,009
Dragon penis.

387
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:20,677
What?

388
00:22:22,698 --> 00:22:27,868
Ancient Greek hunter
by the name of Drakopoolos.

389
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,536
Near as I can tell,
he was a badass

390
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:31,238
whose name, incidentally,
is Greek --

391
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,957
No, no, no.
I got that.

392
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:35,409
Thanks, Ace.

393
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:37,328
Hey.

394
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,831
How's the, uh...
Is the kid?

395
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,049
He's fine.

396
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:46,186
Oh, please, keep going.

397
00:22:46,188 --> 00:22:49,189
Right, so, uh,
Drakopoolos

398
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:50,941
tangled with Zeus
back in the day,

399
00:22:50,943 --> 00:22:53,260
and the Men of Letters
translated his journal.

400
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:54,845
The Men of Letters?

401
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:57,514
It's a secret society.

402
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:59,183
This is
actually their lair.

403
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:02,319
We're legacies.

404
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:09,343
No big deal.

405
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:10,744
Okay.

406
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:13,497
So, it says here
he summoned Zeus into a trap

407
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:15,565
and found out
how to kill him.

408
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:16,667
What's that?

409
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:19,903
Wood from a tree
struck by lightning.

410
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:22,706
Right. So, it says we need
two things for the summon --

411
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,591
frozen energy
from the hand of Zeus,

412
00:23:24,593 --> 00:23:26,260
and the bone
of a worshipper.

413
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:28,178
Frozen energy --
you thinking fulgurite?

414
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,380
Well, it makes sense.

415
00:23:29,382 --> 00:23:30,681
All right.

416
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:32,082
You get on the web,
see if there's any greeks nearby

417
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:33,300
that are still worshipping
the Old Gods.

418
00:23:33,302 --> 00:23:34,351
On it.

419
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:37,354
W-what about the wood?
Is that easy to find?

420
00:23:37,356 --> 00:23:38,739
With a little bit of luck.

421
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:41,925
Oh. Wait --
t-this journal just ends.

422
00:23:41,927 --> 00:23:43,143
What do you mean?

423
00:23:43,145 --> 00:23:44,928
I mean, how do we know
if Drako-whatever survived?

424
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,763
How do we know
Zeus didn't get to him?

425
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:48,232
We don't know.

426
00:23:48,234 --> 00:23:50,534
How do we know
this is going to work?

427
00:23:50,536 --> 00:23:52,903
We never know for sure,
but these books --

428
00:23:52,905 --> 00:23:54,705
they're, uh,
they're pretty good.

429
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:59,460
So, we're hanging our lives
on the writings of a dead man

430
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:01,695
who...is named after
genitalia.

431
00:24:01,697 --> 00:24:04,331
It's a loose
translation.

432
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,949
Experts.

433
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:07,551
All right.
Listen to this.

434
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:10,421
Greek pagans two towns over.
Best part?

435
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:13,290
They have an obit page
with cemeteries.

436
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:14,558
All right.

437
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,510
You two
are on grave duty.

438
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:17,895
We'll handle the B&E.

439
00:24:17,897 --> 00:24:19,930
We'll be in touch.

440
00:24:19,932 --> 00:24:21,398
Hey.

441
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:24,818
B&E? You mean,
breaking and entering?

442
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,437
What for?

443
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,138
Well, the book
calls for fulgurite.

444
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,606
It's a little hard
to come by.

445
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:30,941
The last time
we needed it,

446
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:32,659
we, uh, stole it
from a one-percenter.

447
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:34,962
You do know that fulgurite
is available

448
00:24:34,964 --> 00:24:37,247
in crystal shops
all over, right?

449
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,867
Really?
Yeah.

450
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:44,821
The new age people, they use it
to make cheap jewelry.

451
00:24:44,823 --> 00:24:46,256
Hmm.

452
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:06,193
Why are you doing this,
Sam?

453
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:11,782
We need a bone,
so I dig.

454
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:14,618
No, I mean for us.

455
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,570
This isn't your problem.

456
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:18,572
You're risking your life.

457
00:25:18,574 --> 00:25:20,791
Why'd you risk yours
to steal that fire?

458
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:24,828
Good question.

459
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,197
Wish I could remember.

460
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:29,866
Trust me on this --
it was worth it.

461
00:25:29,868 --> 00:25:32,970
You pretty much, uh,
saved the whole world.

462
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:36,557
Yeah, I guess.

463
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,843
But none of that --
none of that means anything

464
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:42,312
unless I can save my son.

465
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:02,866
Listen,
I know this all seems

466
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:04,535
a little haphazard,
all right?

467
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:06,703
But trust me when I say
that me and Sammy

468
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:09,206
have gone in with a lot less
and come out on top.

469
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:10,740
I believe you.

470
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:12,709
It's just all this.

471
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:16,713
And I'm about to ask Zeus,
the Greek God,

472
00:26:16,715 --> 00:26:18,682
to help cure my son.

473
00:26:18,684 --> 00:26:20,584
The thing
you got to remember

474
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:23,604
is this is not about
asking for his help, okay?

475
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:24,921
He's not your friend.

476
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:27,558
It's about getting him
to do what's right.

477
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:42,656
Stay calm.

478
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:16,406
Oh, come now.

479
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:20,577
Can't we do this
civilized?

480
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:22,446
Well,
it depends on you.

481
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:25,716
All we need is to break a curse
you put on a little kid.

482
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:31,838
So, how about you say, "yes,"
and we all go home?

483
00:27:33,224 --> 00:27:36,093
Nice to see you again,
Prometheus.

484
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:39,096
All cleaned up.

485
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:40,881
I've been
looking for you.

486
00:27:40,883 --> 00:27:43,300
It's gone too far, Zeus.

487
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:46,937
Break the curse.

488
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:53,277
It's your child
who has the affliction.

489
00:27:57,582 --> 00:28:00,033
Interesting.

490
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:01,868
So, what's it gonna be?

491
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:06,290
The easy way or we could
do this the hard way.

492
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:08,458
Break the trap, dear man,
and I'll break the curse.

493
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,459
No dice.

494
00:28:09,461 --> 00:28:10,661
Fix the kid.

495
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:12,045
Going once...

496
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:13,463
Don't be that guy.

497
00:28:13,465 --> 00:28:14,531
Going twice...

498
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:17,000
Hey, you can rot here
for all I care.

499
00:28:17,002 --> 00:28:19,753
Yes, and the child
will continue to suffer.

500
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:32,099
Let's roll.

501
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:45,562
He needs me,
and you know it.

502
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:48,415
No!

503
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:50,834
Hayley, no!

504
00:28:50,836 --> 00:28:52,002
Now save my son.

505
00:28:52,004 --> 00:28:55,922
What do you say?

506
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:06,099
Shall we try this
the hard way?

507
00:29:15,946 --> 00:29:19,415
Bring forth the child.

508
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:21,967
Please.

509
00:29:35,465 --> 00:29:37,349
Balls.

510
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:40,152
I trust
you've met my daughter.

511
00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:44,523
Hayley, don't do it.

512
00:29:47,444 --> 00:29:50,279
This is the son
of Prometheus.

513
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:55,250
And he's cursed
to suffer death every day.

514
00:29:55,252 --> 00:30:00,088
I must admit, I could never have
conceived such a horrible fate

515
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,541
for such
a beautiful child.

516
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,626
Just goes to show,

517
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:08,647
we must all leave room
for happy accidents.

518
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:10,832
What does that mean?
I don't understand.

519
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,017
Tell me,

520
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:16,388
has Prometheus experienced
the child's death yet?

521
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,811
How did he take it?

522
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,866
Did he hurt?

523
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:31,186
Good.

524
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:41,363
Imagine a thousand children
all dying in unison.

525
00:30:41,365 --> 00:30:47,503
Only then would you
understand my pain.

526
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:53,425
But we can't always have
what we want, so...

527
00:30:55,011 --> 00:30:57,212
...one will have to do.

528
00:30:57,214 --> 00:30:58,880
No.

529
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:09,891
I have a special job for you,
my little friend.

530
00:31:13,062 --> 00:31:14,746
Artemis.

531
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,421
Move.

532
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:26,425
So, you know
who this is, Dean,

533
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:27,743
walking us
to our deaths?

534
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:28,877
Don't know. Don't care.

535
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:31,430
It's our God, Artemis --
the Goddess of Hunters.

536
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,714
Oh, that's fascinating.

537
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,800
See, she's who we'd
pray to for courage

538
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:37,803
when hunting
the Gorgon or the Minotaur.

539
00:31:37,805 --> 00:31:40,138
Of course, she's not really
worship worthy anymore,

540
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,057
uh, having lost
a step and all.

541
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:46,495
The hell I have.

542
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:48,564
Really, Sam?
Trash-talking a God?

543
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:50,282
Seriously?

544
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:55,237
So, let's see
if we can make up

545
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:58,206
for seven years
of lost time.

546
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,308
Still at full power?
Really?

547
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,727
Then why did it
take you seven years

548
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:19,811
to track down Prometheus?

549
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:20,795
He was hiding.

550
00:32:20,797 --> 00:32:22,981
Hiding from you?

551
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,485
So the God of Hunters couldn't
find a shack in Montana?

552
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:29,605
Maybe it's that you didn't
want to find him.

553
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:33,575
Good, Sam,
you're doing great.

554
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,661
Your dad's gonna
kill that kid, you know?

555
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,695
Don't worry.

556
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:39,481
He'll come back.

557
00:32:39,483 --> 00:32:41,566
Unlike you.

558
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:43,118
He was in love with you,
you know.

559
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,536
He told us.

560
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:46,288
You lie.

561
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,793
Okay, sure, yeah.

562
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:54,212
Believe whatever you want.

563
00:32:58,334 --> 00:32:59,518
No, no, no, no.

564
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,720
Don't pass out on me
just yet.

565
00:33:01,722 --> 00:33:04,890
I'm only
just getting started.

566
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,481
What did he say to you?

567
00:33:12,483 --> 00:33:14,950
This wasn't the first time
he escaped that mountain,

568
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,485
and that you
let him go free

569
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:17,819
as long as you could hide
your little tryst

570
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:18,904
from the old man.

571
00:33:18,906 --> 00:33:20,539
The hell he said.

572
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,240
His brain is mush.

573
00:33:22,242 --> 00:33:23,692
Oh, yeah?
Then how did I know?

574
00:33:23,694 --> 00:33:25,410
What, have you spilled it
to anyone?

575
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:28,930
Homer? Hesiod? Herodotus?

576
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:31,066
Of course not.

577
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:33,135
You were afraid big daddy
would find out

578
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:35,871
that you fell for the person
he hates most in this world.

579
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:37,923
Of course, when he saw
the zombie article,

580
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:39,307
it kind of forced your hand,

581
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:42,094
and you had to come hunt him
down no matter how much it hurt.

582
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:43,845
You know what?
Go ahead.

583
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:44,896
Kill us.

584
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,749
And let your father
slaughter that boy.

585
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:51,837
Over and over again.

586
00:33:53,222 --> 00:33:55,023
That won't leave a mark.

587
00:33:56,192 --> 00:33:59,244
You like being an immortal,
don't you?

588
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,497
Oh, sure,
you die every day,

589
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:06,668
but nothing
can keep you dead.

590
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:11,506
It's almost like taking
a little nap.

591
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:15,711
All of your cares and worries
disappear for a little while.

592
00:34:15,713 --> 00:34:21,466
Well, it's sleepy time,
my dear boy.

593
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,224
This has to stop, father.

594
00:34:30,926 --> 00:34:33,228
Stop?

595
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,782
I'm only
just getting started.

596
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:38,283
You've done enough.

597
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:43,955
I am doing this for us --
for our kind.

598
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:48,827
He is the reason we're here
and not ruling the world.

599
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:52,947
He's the reason they have
forgotten all about us.

600
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:55,133
Let them go.

601
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,470
All of them.

602
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:03,475
I am your father,
and you will obey me.

603
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,564
You were once my father.

604
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:13,935
Now you're someone else.

605
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,699
I never get tired
of watching you die.

606
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:32,871
Your boy is going
on the mountain.

607
00:37:40,178 --> 00:37:43,264
I'm sorry.

608
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:16,814
You know what?

609
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:19,750
How about we go get
some ice-cream sundaes?

610
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:23,087
No.

611
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:25,556
I'd like to stay.

612
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:50,531
Well, here's to that crazy
little wild card called love.

613
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:53,534
How did you know Artemis had
the hots for Prometheus, anyway?

614
00:38:53,536 --> 00:38:55,586
Intuition.

615
00:38:55,588 --> 00:38:58,488
Uh...luck.

616
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,625
Yeah, well, whatever it was,
it worked...pretty much.

617
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:03,711
At least the kid's
all right.

618
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:07,298
You know...

619
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:12,887
I'm starting to think
maybe I was being naive.

620
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:15,222
What are you
talking about?

621
00:39:15,224 --> 00:39:20,544
When I said that I could
just will myself

622
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:22,963
into coming out of these trials
unscathed.

623
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:24,782
No, no, no.

624
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:27,517
Stop with the sullen
emo crap, all right?

625
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,538
That's -- you're not gonna die
like Prometheus.

626
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,156
How do you know, Dean?

627
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:34,742
Bobby, Rufus,
now Prometheus --

628
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:36,577
you think any of them
chose death?

629
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:37,962
No.

630
00:39:37,964 --> 00:39:40,197
The life chose for them.

631
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:42,216
Yeah, well,
you promised, okay?

632
00:39:42,218 --> 00:39:44,919
You promised to live a long,
Clark Griswold life

633
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:47,805
full of prostate exams
and colonoscopies, all right?

634
00:39:47,807 --> 00:39:50,707
You're not welshing
on that deal, not on my watch.

635
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:54,011
If you die, it's gonna be
because of something normal.

636
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,647
Like a heart attack?

637
00:39:56,649 --> 00:39:59,350
Exactly.

638
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,820
Yeah, eat your burger.

639
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:22,756
Cass, you got your ears on?

640
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:34,685
Listen, you know I am not
one for praying,

641
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:38,989
'cause in my book it's...
it's the same as begging.

642
00:40:41,026 --> 00:40:44,928
But this is about Sam,
so I need you to hear me.

643
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:51,335
We are going
into this deal blind...

644
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:56,557
...and I don't know what's ahead

645
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,126
or what it's
gonna bring for Sam.

646
00:41:00,445 --> 00:41:05,549
Now, he's covering pretty good,
but I know that he is hurting,

647
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:09,136
and this one
was supposed to be on me.

648
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:17,811
So, for all that
we've been through,

649
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:21,148
I'm asking you...

650
00:41:23,902 --> 00:41:27,571
...you keep a lookout
for my little brother, okay?

651
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:44,688
Where the hell are you, man?
