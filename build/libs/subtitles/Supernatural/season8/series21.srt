1
00:00:02,517 --> 00:00:03,779
If the Demon Tablet
can shut the Gates of Hell,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,997
what can
the Angel Tablet do?

3
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:06,165
I can't let you take that,
Dean.

4
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:08,501
I just know that I have to
protect this tablet now.

5
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:10,152
From Naomi?
And from you.

6
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:12,004
From me?
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:13,088
Cass! Damn it.

8
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,040
My name is Naomi.
Oh, I know who you are.

9
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:16,658
And I know what you did to Cass
after he got out of Purgatory.

10
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,660
They're controlling us,
Castiel!

11
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:20,963
And now Castiel is
in the wind

12
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:23,098
with a hydrogen bomb
in his pocket.

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,217
God built a series of tests.

14
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,969
When you've done all three,
you can slam the Gates.

15
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:28,304
What's the second trial?

16
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:30,105
An innocent soul
has to be rescued from Hell

17
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:31,390
and delivered unto Heaven.

18
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:35,144
It's done.

19
00:00:35,146 --> 00:00:38,180
That second trial hit you a lot
harder than that first one.

20
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:40,199
He's in my head, Dean.

21
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,400
Fear, the hiding.

22
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:42,868
And if he's in my head,
he knows where I am!

23
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,221
Thought you could
elude me forever?

24
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:47,323
He's gone.

25
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:48,407
Little geek
made a run for it.

26
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,659
Yeah, but where?

27
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:31,617
Kevin, come on! It's us!
Open up.

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,570
We're bleeding out here.

29
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:37,923
Come on, man. It's me.

30
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:41,160
Now it's <i>wet</i> me.

31
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:42,578
You forgot the knock.

32
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,346
What's the point of a secret
knock if you don't use it?

33
00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:46,765
Sorry, Kevin.

34
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:50,252
We got it.

35
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:56,692
Got what?

36
00:01:56,694 --> 00:01:58,811
Uh, we caught a tip

37
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:01,113
that Crowley was moving
his earth-side operations,

38
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:04,116
so we, uh, laid ourselves
an awesome trap.

39
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:05,484
And it worked.

40
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:09,371
We got the other half
of the tablet.

41
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:11,707
What?

42
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:14,793
It's the light
at the end of your tunnel, kid.

43
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:17,946
Don't say
we never got you nothing.

44
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:20,966
Holy crap.
Are you kidding?

45
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:23,502
We can get the third trial.

46
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:25,504
We can finally figure out

47
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:28,557
how to close the Gates of Hell
on Crowley's ass forever.

48
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:31,010
Sounds good to me.

49
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:33,429
So, we digging up the other half
of that thing or what?

50
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:37,266
Don't need to.

51
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:42,321
So, uh
Special K,

52
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:43,972
you keep your nose
to the God-stone.

53
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:45,824
We're gonna drive out
and make a lot of noise

54
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:48,310
a long way from here,
keep the safeboat safe for you.

55
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,550
We'll be back
as soon as we can, okay?

56
00:02:55,952 --> 00:02:58,921
I guess he's okay.

57
00:02:58,923 --> 00:03:01,373
All right. Don't forget
to lock up after us.

58
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:35,157
So, it's three trials.

59
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,078
Three trials and the Winchesters
get to lock the door on me.

60
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:43,532
Ha!

61
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:46,719
You, fake Sam,

62
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,420
if you're gonna tip our hand,

63
00:03:48,422 --> 00:03:51,373
I'll have to scrub
Kevin's short-term memory again.

64
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,876
And that's risky,
so watch the patois in there.

65
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:56,345
Patois?

66
00:03:56,347 --> 00:03:58,097
Your slang.

67
00:03:58,099 --> 00:03:59,898
"Special K,"
"nose to the God-stone" --

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,049
that's the way <i>Dean</i> speaks.

69
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:07,690
Sam is...more basic,
more sincere.

70
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:12,945
Remember, I want two distinct,
authentic characterizations.

71
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:14,730
Yes, sir.

72
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:25,073
I was born to direct.

73
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:29,075

75
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:37,534
All right, here we go --

76
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:41,669
John Winchester's famous
cure-all kitchen-sink stew.

77
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,490
There you go.

78
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,025
Enough cayenne pepper in there
to burn your lips out,

79
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:47,744
just like
dad used to make.

80
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:51,915
You want me to do the whole, uh,
airplane thing with the spoon?

81
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:57,387
When was
the last time you ate?

82
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,389
I don't --
days, Sam.

83
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:02,375
It's been three days.

84
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:07,097
When did you get that?

85
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,882
When did you start
throwing off heat waves?

86
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:13,653
Here.
Enough! Dean, please.

87
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,559
The bloody handkerchiefs,
the fever, the shaky legs --

88
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:20,610
this is not good.

89
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,446
Well, I'm not good,

90
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:27,701
and I'm not going to be good
until we can start moving again,

91
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,803
until I can start
the third trial.

92
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:32,756
Trial? I wouldn't let you
start a moped.

93
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:36,760
We're on the rails
with this thing, okay,

94
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,628
and the only way out of it
is through it.

95
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,430
Believe me, I know,
and you know how bad

96
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:43,750
I want to slam the door
on all those sons of bitches.

97
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:46,553
But you got to let me
take care of you, man.

98
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,689
You got to let me help you
get your strength back.

99
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:55,028
This isn't
a cold or a fever

100
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,398
or whatever it is
you're supposed to feed.

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,600
This is part of it all.

102
00:06:00,602 --> 00:06:04,571
Those first two trials --
they're not just things I did.

103
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,407
T-they're doing something
to me.

104
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,076
They're changing me,
Dean.

105
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,310
It's Kevin.

106
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:29,012
Finally.

107
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,385
<i>Sam, Dean,</i>

108
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:37,854
<i>I've set up this message</i>
<i>with some software</i>

109
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,023
<i>and a remote server</i>
<i>so it'd send itself to you</i>

110
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,742
<i>if I didn't reset it</i>
<i>with a command once a week,</i>

111
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:46,012
<i>which means I didn't reset it</i>
<i>this week.</i>

112
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:48,331
<i>And there's only one reason</i>
<i>I wouldn't,</i>

113
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,101
<i>which means if you're watching</i>
<i>this then I --</i>

114
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:54,487
<i>then I'm -- I'm dead.</i>

115
00:06:56,857 --> 00:07:00,043
<i>I'm dead, you bastards,</i>

116
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,163
<i>so screw you, screw God,</i>
<i>and everybody in between!</i>

117
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:08,635
<i>Crowley must have gotten to me,</i>

118
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,888
<i>and the one thing I know is</i>
<i>that I won't break this time.</i>

119
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,142
<i>I'm not sure how I know,</i>
<i>but -- but I do.</i>

120
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,879
<i>I've been uploading</i>
<i>all my notes and translations.</i>

121
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:22,282
<i>I'm sending you the links</i>
<i>so you can get all of it.</i>

122
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:25,852
<i>You guys are gonna have to try</i>
<i>to figure out the rest.</i>

123
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:31,024
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

124
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:37,364
<i>I know it was my job,</i>
<i>but I -- but I couldn't...</i>

125
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:44,504
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

126
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:50,760
Damn it!

127
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:02,388
Yeah. I know you
haven't seen him, Keel.

128
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,024
Nobody has.

129
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,325
All right,
well, if you talk to Garth,

130
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:07,744
then just
have him call in.

131
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:08,962
Yeah.

132
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:12,332
Garth still M.I.A.?

133
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:13,249
Yeah.

134
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:15,952
How about the other Prophets
in line?

135
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,788
I mean, if Kevin is, uh...

136
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,408
Is dead, then won't one of them
be activated?

137
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,261
Nothing.
No, not a peep.

138
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:32,752
Here we are -- no lead,
no tablet, squat.

139
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:38,641
Well, I mean,
we got all this.

140
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,661
We should have
moved him here.

141
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,113
I guess I've been
acquiring the taste.

142
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:02,465
Yeah? The coffee's
not too bad here.

143
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:07,587
You know, I remember
when you first discovered it.

144
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,558
Before you started brewing it,
you'd just chew the berries.

145
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,960
Folktale is true, by the way.
You learned it from the goats.

146
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,799
Uh, been on the road
a long time, huh?

147
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:23,653
Feels like I've been
on the run forever.

148
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,141
Um, I'm sorry, mister,

149
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:29,475
but you're gonna have to order
more than coffee

150
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:31,661
if you want to keep
the table.

151
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:34,013
Oh, of course. Um...

152
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:38,418
I'll have the smart-heart
beer-battered tempura tempters.

153
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,372
Of course.
Coming right up.

154
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,597
They're getting closer.

155
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,881
What's that, chief?

156
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:01,024
I swear to God, Lance,
the guy just disappeared.

157
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:10,850
You on the crack again,
Perry?

158
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:18,207
Ion, tell me
that you have good news.

159
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:21,544
He's using
a clever tactic.

160
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:23,012
It's a restaurant
called Biggerson's.

161
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:26,999
The humans have built hundreds
of them, almost exactly alike.

162
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,768
What are
you talking about?

163
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,553
It's their sameness.

164
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:32,555
Castiel
is using it against us.

165
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:34,724
Now, we try to
orient ourselves,

166
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:36,859
but it's as if we're in
every Biggerson's at once,

167
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:38,694
trapped in a quantum
superposition,

168
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:42,315
now, he chooses
which to go to next --

169
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,116
that's what's giving him
the edge.

170
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:46,369
You're saying that
you can't catch him?

171
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:51,407
There -- there is
just so many Biggerson's.

172
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:53,209
Very well.

173
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,412
You say
he can't be caught.

174
00:10:57,864 --> 00:11:02,752
Then we will simply have to
make him stop.

175
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,925
Hmm.

176
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:13,212
There it is again,
every time.

177
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,230
Hmm?

178
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:17,149
This symbol -- I know it.

179
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:19,402
Now, Kevin has it down as --
as sort of like a signature

180
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:21,387
for the scribe of God.

181
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,439
It appears every time
Metatron makes one of his,

182
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:24,941
uh, like editor's notes.

183
00:11:24,943 --> 00:11:27,410
Okay.

184
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:28,727
But I think
I've seen it before.

185
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,079
I mean,
it was a long time ago.

186
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:34,116
It was one of my, uh,
humanities courses at Stanford.

187
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,089
They taught word of God
at Stanford?

188
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:43,259
No, uh...It was an overview
of native American art.

189
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:44,844
I think
it's a petroglyph.

190
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:47,079
A petro-what, now?

191
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,882
This one belonged
to a tiny tribe in Colorado,

192
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:51,384
more of a-a clan, really.

193
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:54,420
It says here they held
onto their scrap of mountains

194
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,755
when all the other tribes
fell to the white man.

195
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,091
Uh, so this glyph was
a territorial marker.

196
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:03,262
Closest translation --
"Messenger of God."

197
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:10,870
"Messenger of God."

198
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:14,073
"Messenger of God."
Dean, we have to go there.

199
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:16,292
On that hunch?
You can barely function.

200
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:18,744
I'm only gonna get worse.

201
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:20,379
I mean, until I get back
to the real job,

202
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:24,216
until we find the third trial --
we're out of Prophets!

203
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:26,168
We're not gonna figure out
what Kevin couldn't!

204
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,803
I say we go
to this messenger of God

205
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:29,338
who wrote it
in the first place!

206
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,507
And you think
that this Metatron

207
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:34,760
is hiding out in the mountains
with a bunch of Indians?

208
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:37,396
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

209
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:42,651
You're not -- you're not really
supposed to say "Indians."

210
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:46,772
It's...
We should go.

211
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:50,308
You are delirious.

212
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:04,256
You have to stop.

213
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:07,627
They said
you have to stop.

214
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,679
No.

215
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:14,050
They said you have to stop.
No.

216
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:16,352
You have to stop.

217
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:22,224
You have to stop.

218
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:24,060
No.

219
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:25,695
You have to stop.

220
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:30,683
They said you have to stop.

221
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,672
You have to stop.

222
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:53,321
Nice place.

223
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:12,457
Morning. Hi.

224
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,394
Uh, we'd like a room.

225
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:22,585
Here, please.

226
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:29,341
Hmm.

227
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:40,853
Did you hear that?

228
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:45,924
Hear what?

229
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:49,879
He has the flu.

230
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,037
You have to stop.

231
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,540
You have to stop.
They said you --

232
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:02,808
Aah!

233
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:07,229
Can't hear myself think.

234
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:10,833
We were supposed to be their
shepherds, not their murderers.

235
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:13,636
Not always, Angel.

236
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:18,140
There was that day back in Egypt
not so long ago

237
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:22,111
where we slew
every firstborn infant

238
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:24,313
whose door wasn't splashed
with lamb's blood,

239
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:27,399
and that was just P.R.

240
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:29,435
Well, I wasn't there.

241
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:33,305
Oh, you were there.

242
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,641
You just
don't remember it.

243
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,278
How -- how many times

244
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,198
have you torn into my head
and washed it clean?

245
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,834
Frankly, too damn many.

246
00:15:51,991 --> 00:15:55,427
You're the famous spanner
in the works.

247
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:57,329
Honestly,
I think you came off the line

248
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,764
with a crack
in your chassis.

249
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:02,301
You have never done
what you were told,

250
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,104
not completely.

251
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:08,057
You don't even die right,
do you?

252
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:12,010
Where is the Angel Tablet,
Castiel?

253
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:17,783
In the words of a...
good friend,

254
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:20,119
bite me.

255
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:23,455
Oh, we'll bite.

256
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:26,625
Don't worry.

257
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:31,530
Go. Search all
these...Biggerson's.

258
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:35,918
He must have hidden it
along the way.

259
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:49,481
I can barely see.

260
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:53,519
I need food.

261
00:16:56,323 --> 00:16:59,658
All right. Uh, barbecue ribs,
mashed potatoes.

262
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,410
<i>Garlic</i> mashed potatoes.

263
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:04,530
Garlic mashed potatoes,
mixed greens with baby lettuce,

264
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:09,251
cornbread,
and, uh, pad Thai.

265
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:13,322
Garth says there's a good little
place on the other side of town.

266
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:17,743
What the hell?
Kid's been working hard.

267
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:29,355
Those guys
aren't half bad.

268
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:31,923
No, sir.
You chose well.

269
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,376
Of course,
if I wasn't running everything,

270
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:36,195
I could have played Dean
myself.

271
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:39,064
Oh, you would have made
a great Dean, sir.

272
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:52,911
Regular tourist mecca
we got here.

273
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:54,797
We're the only guests
in this whole place.

274
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,384
Last entry in the registry
was in '06.

275
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:01,720
Hey,
you remember when, uh...

276
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:03,939
when dad took us to the bottom
of the Grand Canyon

277
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:06,141
on that pack-mule ride?

278
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:07,543
The what?

279
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:12,631
And your, uh --
your mule kept farting,

280
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:18,070
just letting go,
like gale force.

281
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:20,189
Dude, you were like
four years old.

282
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:21,640
<i>I</i> barely remember that.

283
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:26,478
You rode a farty donkey.

284
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,147
Okay, uh,
I'm gonna go check out

285
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,000
the Two Rivers Travel Museum
and Trading Post.

286
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:33,502
Yeah, yeah!

287
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:35,654
I'm gonna --
I'm gonna, um --

288
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm gonna follow
the hotel manager,

289
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:39,825
D-Dr. Scowley-Scowl.

290
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,294
He's like a villain
from "Scooby-Doo."

291
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:44,496
No, hey,
uh, little big man,

292
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,633
you should get some rest.

293
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:49,968
Yeah,
I can do that, too.

294
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:55,441
The people
of the Two Rivers tribe

295
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:57,276
came to this land
centuries ago,

296
00:18:57,278 --> 00:18:59,695
a land that
was harsh and stony.

297
00:18:59,697 --> 00:19:02,364
But their mighty leader

298
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:04,533
told his people
that they must stay here.

299
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:07,069
He claimed that
this was the home on Earth

300
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:09,288
of the great spirits'
sacred messenger

301
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,022
and that if
they'd made offerings,

302
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,691
their blessings
would be many.

303
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,160
What were the offerings?
Huh?

304
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:19,030
Uh, what did the great spirit's
sacred messenger ask for?

305
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,799
Stories.

306
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,391
He asked the people
to tell him stories.

307
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:34,229
I bet I know
what the blessings were.

308
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,932
Sam?

309
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:06,772
I've been all over them.
It's not there.

310
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,442
Why?

311
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:13,245
Why are you doing this?

312
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:16,949
Let us put the tablet
back where it should be.

313
00:21:16,951 --> 00:21:19,835
I need to protect it.

314
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:21,670
From the Angels?

315
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:24,673
From all of us.

316
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:31,162
I'm just going to have to
pull you apart, aren't I?

317
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,360
Naomi, darling.

318
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:49,665
Miss me?

319
00:22:01,062 --> 00:22:04,014
Get off! What the hell?!
Take it easy, man.

320
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:05,098
God!

321
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy. Take it --

322
00:22:09,238 --> 00:22:11,321
Found you on the floor,
passed out.

323
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:12,406
Your temperature was 107.

324
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:15,158
I had to force it down
or you were toast.

325
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,561
He's here, Dean.
The Metatron is here.

326
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:20,447
I know it.
I can hear him.

327
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:22,199
What are
you talking about?

328
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:25,702
All I know is that
I'm connected to it somehow.

329
00:22:25,704 --> 00:22:28,338
What, like you got
a link to him, like a Prophet?

330
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,257
I don't know!

331
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:32,592
I just know he's here.
The Metatron is here.

332
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,761
Okay. Here where?

333
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:37,881
I can show you.

334
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,434
I can show you.

335
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:42,719
The manager --
he was delivering books to him.

336
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:44,420
Books?
Books.

337
00:22:44,422 --> 00:22:47,791
Hard-covers, paperbacks,
novels -- books.

338
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:50,644
Stories.

339
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:54,314
Do you like it?

340
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:58,601
I had my R&D people melt down
one of your Angel blades,

341
00:22:58,603 --> 00:23:02,539
cast it into bullets.
Seems to do the trick.

342
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,940
How dare you.

343
00:23:03,942 --> 00:23:08,111
I am the daringest devil
you've ever met, love.

344
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:14,401
We've been here before,
haven't we?

345
00:23:15,753 --> 00:23:18,588
Let's see
who blinks first.

346
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:27,481
Hmm.

347
00:23:33,137 --> 00:23:36,273
Hi, Cass.

348
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:41,495
That's right, Cass.

349
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:44,331
I got me
an Angel on the payroll.

350
00:23:45,816 --> 00:23:48,985
It's that kind of universe
these days.

351
00:23:56,844 --> 00:24:02,182
Now grab <i>him</i>
and follow me.

352
00:24:03,518 --> 00:24:06,019
Hey, kid, you okay?

353
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:07,503
I can't, all right?

354
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:09,339
It's the break
in the stone.

355
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:11,858
There's key writing.
I-I can't make it out.

356
00:24:13,177 --> 00:24:14,644
You guys were right.

357
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:17,063
I-I do need the other half
of the tablet to get the trial.

358
00:24:17,065 --> 00:24:19,449
It's not too far from here.

359
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:25,739
Awesome.
Uh, well, what's the 10-20?

360
00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:31,244
Just wanted to take a moment
away from the main action...

361
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:39,702
...to chat
with my old business partner.

362
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:42,672
I assume
you won't die just yet.

363
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:45,508
Takes a painful long time
to bleed out from the gut.

364
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:49,045
You can do
whatever you want, Crowley.

365
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:53,049
I will never tell you
where I buried the tablet.

366
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:55,352
I know, Cass.

367
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:57,020
I know.

368
00:24:57,022 --> 00:24:59,489
Luckily...

369
00:24:59,491 --> 00:25:01,408
I don't believe
you have to.

370
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,693
I've been getting
regular updates

371
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:07,864
from my expensive friend
here.

372
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:09,866
Naomi should have caught you
out of the gate,

373
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:11,835
seeing as lately
she's been knuckles deep

374
00:25:11,837 --> 00:25:12,902
in that melon of yours.

375
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:16,572
She thinks
that your touching the tablet

376
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:20,076
has broken her spell over you.
Hmm?

377
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:23,446
The tablets
weren't meant for the Angels,

378
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:26,749
and they weren't
meant for you.

379
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:28,802
She's got
a lot on her plate,

380
00:25:28,804 --> 00:25:32,088
so you can't fault her
for missing it.

381
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,424
I was thinking to myself,
"self,

382
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:38,478
"if Cass got away from her
by touching the tablet,

383
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,265
why would he ever <i>stop</i>
touching the tablet?"

384
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:44,567
And then I thought
to myself,

385
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:48,938
"self...he hasn't
stopped touching the tablet,

386
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,606
now, has he?"

387
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:11,446
Aha!

388
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:22,805
Oh, you're a pip, you are.

389
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:25,442
What?

390
00:26:25,444 --> 00:26:28,945
Oh!

391
00:26:28,947 --> 00:26:31,973
This is the king.

392
00:26:32,837 --> 00:26:34,818
The kid told us
where the other half was,

393
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:37,337
but it...wasn't.

394
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:40,273
Dab of crap tricked us,

395
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:43,760
sent us into some kind
of Hunter mousetrap.

396
00:26:43,762 --> 00:26:46,262
You jackasses.
You're ruining my streak!

397
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,133
Watch him.

398
00:26:51,969 --> 00:26:54,471
I'll be right back.

399
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,308
I should be taking you
to the E.R.

400
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,477
They can't
do anything for me.

401
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:03,279
You know, I've been
remembering things --

402
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:05,482
little things
so clearly.

403
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:06,616
What?
Donkey rides?

404
00:27:06,618 --> 00:27:09,619
You used to read to me,
um, when I was little --

405
00:27:09,621 --> 00:27:12,906
I-I mean really little, from --
from that old, uh

406
00:27:12,908 --> 00:27:14,574
"Classics Illustrated"
comic book.

407
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:16,376
You remember that?
No.

408
00:27:16,378 --> 00:27:17,961
"Knights
of the Round Table."

409
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:19,579
Had all of
King Arthur's knights,

410
00:27:19,581 --> 00:27:21,965
and they were all on the quest
for the Holy Grail.

411
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:24,751
And I remember looking
at this picture of Sir Galahad,

412
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:26,469
and -- and --
and he was kneeling,

413
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:30,256
and -- and light streaming
over his face.

414
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:35,979
And I remember...
thinking, um,

415
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:39,766
I could never
go on a quest like that...

416
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:46,222
...because I'm not clean.

417
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:51,060
I mean,
I-I was just a little kid.

418
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,450
You think maybe I knew,

419
00:27:57,452 --> 00:28:00,420
I mean,
deep down, that...

420
00:28:00,422 --> 00:28:05,842
I had...
demon blood in me

421
00:28:05,844 --> 00:28:10,013
and about the evil of it
and that I...

422
00:28:10,015 --> 00:28:13,650
wasn't pure?

423
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:16,752
Sam,
it's not your fault.

424
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:19,139
It doesn't matter
anymore,

425
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:22,308
because these trials...

426
00:28:24,761 --> 00:28:27,197
...they're purifying me.

427
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:40,126
They were here, the -- the --
the books, the boxes!

428
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:42,078
They -- they're gone.

429
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,595
Who are you?

430
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:31,681
Metatron?

431
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:36,186
This is Metatron?
<i>This</i> is Metatron?

432
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:38,571
Sit down.

433
00:29:50,118 --> 00:29:51,918
Who sent you?

434
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,537
We came on our own.

435
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,339
We're the Winchesters.

436
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:58,124
I'm Dean. This is Sam.

437
00:29:58,126 --> 00:30:00,627
You work for Michael?

438
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:01,994
Or Lucifer?

439
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:06,933
What, you really
haven't heard of us?

440
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:09,803
What kind of angel are you?

441
00:30:09,805 --> 00:30:12,305
W-we're
the freaking Winchesters.

442
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:23,199
How --
how far can this go?

443
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:25,485
Shh. Shut up.

444
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:28,288
Ion...

445
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,241
How far can we
let it all drop?

446
00:30:31,243 --> 00:30:33,493
This charge
was left to us.

447
00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:34,911
It's our mission.

448
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:38,832
Do you even know
what the mission was?

449
00:30:40,217 --> 00:30:44,254
They've been
in all our heads.

450
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:51,094
We aren't machines for them
to program and reprogram.

451
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:53,396
That wasn't
what this was meant to be.

452
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:56,933
Nothing matters.

453
00:30:56,935 --> 00:31:01,521
You are so wrong,
brother.

454
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:08,394
It all matters.

455
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:28,581
You little prat.

456
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:32,185
You having fun yet?

457
00:31:34,855 --> 00:31:36,756
Screw you.

458
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:39,476
Am I seeing this?

459
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:43,480
How did you
figure it out?

460
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:46,483
It started when they forgot
the secret knock.

461
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:49,936
But really, it --
it was the way they acted.

462
00:31:49,938 --> 00:31:51,871
I don't think
on their best day Sam and Dean

463
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:54,774
would go into town
and get me a barbecue dinner,

464
00:31:54,776 --> 00:31:58,411
n-not when there are
leftover burritos in the fridge.

465
00:31:58,413 --> 00:32:00,964
So...

466
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:04,751
Demons
were too polite?

467
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:07,837
Yeah.

468
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,107
Well,
I'll be a son of a whore.

469
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:12,976
Michael and Lucifer --

470
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:16,346
t-those -- those dudes
are in the deep fryer.

471
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:18,264
Yeah. We put them there
ourselves.

472
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:22,268
What about
Gabriel and Raphael?

473
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,837
Dead.

474
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,321
You really don't know this?

475
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:27,690
I've been very careful.

476
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:29,409
Hey, can you --

477
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:31,861
Can you turn that down?

478
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:34,948
Turn what down?

479
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,483
Oh.

480
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:39,151
You're resonating.

481
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:41,921
Resonating? What --
what do you mean, resonating?

482
00:32:41,923 --> 00:32:44,207
You've undertaken
the trials.

483
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:47,927
You're trying to pull one
of the great levers, aren't you?

484
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:51,047
You're pretty far along,
too.

485
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:54,968
You get that far along, you
start resonating with the word

486
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,004
or with its source
on the material plane --

487
00:32:58,006 --> 00:33:01,173
with me.

488
00:33:01,175 --> 00:33:04,310
You said you were being careful.
Careful how?

489
00:33:04,312 --> 00:33:06,362
I'm not one of them.

490
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:08,014
I'm not an Archangel.

491
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:10,483
I'm really
more run-of-the-mill.

492
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:12,986
I worked
in the secretarial pool

493
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:16,823
before God chose me
to take down the Word.

494
00:33:16,825 --> 00:33:21,327
Anyway, he seemed very worried
about his work,

495
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:22,829
what would happen to it
when he left,

496
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:26,966
so he had me write down
instructions.

497
00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:30,970
Then he was gone.

498
00:33:32,556 --> 00:33:35,758
After that...

499
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,596
The Archangels took over.

500
00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:43,600
They cried,
and they wailed.

501
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:47,670
They wanted their father back.
I mean, we all did.

502
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:52,725
But then --
then they started to scheme.

503
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:56,496
The Archangels decided
if they couldn't have dad,

504
00:33:56,498 --> 00:33:59,332
they'd take over the Universe
themselves.

505
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:03,169
But they couldn't
do anything that big

506
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:05,338
without the Word of God.

507
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,342
So I began to realize

508
00:34:09,344 --> 00:34:13,212
maybe they would realize...

509
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:16,215
they needed me.

510
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:20,086
So, you get
a ruffle in your feathers

511
00:34:20,088 --> 00:34:22,388
and just decide
to disappear,

512
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,707
go stick your head in the sand
forever?

513
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,444
You have no idea
what's been going on out there?

514
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:30,280
Nope.

515
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:34,901
That's the whole point.

516
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:36,653
You soldiers
down in the Garrison --

517
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:39,605
at least they let you
believe the lie.

518
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:44,210
Upstairs, working for Naomi,
working in intelligence,

519
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:46,663
we had no option
but to live in the dirt.

520
00:34:46,665 --> 00:34:49,716
She never reset me completely.
I always knew too much.

521
00:34:49,718 --> 00:34:53,136
I had to --
I had to do my job.

522
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:54,420
Ion...

523
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:57,223
Shut up!

524
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:10,103
So you have been holed up here
or -- or -- or in a wigwam

525
00:35:10,105 --> 00:35:12,471
or before that,
in some cave,

526
00:35:12,473 --> 00:35:14,440
listening to stories,
reading books?

527
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,828
And it was something
to watch.

528
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,949
What you brought
to his Earth --

529
00:35:22,951 --> 00:35:26,836
all the mayhem,
the murder,

530
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:32,675
just the raw, wild invention
of God's naked apes --

531
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:35,945
it was mind-blowing.

532
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:41,000
But really, really...

533
00:35:41,002 --> 00:35:43,219
It was your storytelling.

534
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:48,775
That is the true flower
of free will,

535
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:52,879
at least
as you've mastered it so far.

536
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:57,200
When you create stories,
you become Gods

537
00:35:57,202 --> 00:36:02,872
of tiny, intricate dimensions
unto themselves.

538
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:06,626
So many worlds.

539
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:12,031
I have read as much as it's
possible for an angel to read,

540
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:13,365
and I haven't caught up.

541
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:16,368
You know what?

542
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:20,089
Pull the freaking trigger.

543
00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:23,542
What?

544
00:36:23,544 --> 00:36:25,728
Pull the freaking trigger...
Sam.

545
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,214
...you cowardly piece of garbage.
Hey.

546
00:36:28,216 --> 00:36:29,982
All the time
you've been hiding here,

547
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:32,551
how much suffering
have you read over?

548
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:34,320
Humanity's suffering.

549
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:37,824
And how much of it has been
at the hands of your kind?!

550
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:40,293
Hey, hey.

551
00:36:40,295 --> 00:36:41,944
You want a story?

552
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:47,450
Try Kevin Tran's story.
He was just a kid.

553
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:48,951
He was a good,
straight-"A" kid,

554
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:52,672
and then he got sucked in to
all of this -- this Angel crap

555
00:36:52,674 --> 00:36:57,409
and became a Prophet of
the Word of God -- your Prophet.

556
00:36:58,745 --> 00:37:00,746
And you should have been
looking out for him, but no!

557
00:37:00,748 --> 00:37:04,133
Instead, you're here,
holed up, reading books.

558
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:10,540
He's dead now
because of you.

559
00:37:15,595 --> 00:37:18,815
You know the Winchesters are
up to the third trial?

560
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,652
You know they're gonna
shut the door on Hell?

561
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:25,604
I'm not worried, kid.

562
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:32,712
You have no idea
what's on this demon tablet,

563
00:37:32,714 --> 00:37:37,049
all right, the power you could
have gotten with this

564
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:39,118
if you weren't running around like
a chicken with his head cut off.

565
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,971
You think
I can't make you tell?

566
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:47,009
I know you can't,
and you do, too.

567
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:49,679
You know what?

568
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:52,798
I've already won.

569
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,270
I have the Angel Tablet,
you little smudge.

570
00:37:58,805 --> 00:38:02,975
And I got deals and plans
up the jacksie.

571
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:08,247
And I don't...
Need...You!

572
00:38:52,224 --> 00:38:54,041
Is that it?

573
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:55,459
Is he good?

574
00:38:55,461 --> 00:38:58,896
Give him a minute.

575
00:39:07,473 --> 00:39:10,575
How did you get past
Crowley's angel warding?

576
00:39:10,577 --> 00:39:13,744
I'm the scribe of God.
I erased it.

577
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:15,246
But you saw, right?

578
00:39:15,248 --> 00:39:16,831
I mean, you --
you're caught up

579
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:19,133
on everything
that's been going on,

580
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:20,651
all the crap
that your brethren's

581
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:23,454
been doing to humanity
all this time?

582
00:39:23,456 --> 00:39:26,207
I saved the boy,
didn't I?

583
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:29,594
But are you in?
With us, I mean.

584
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:34,432
You really intend
on closing the doors of Hell?

585
00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:38,836
Seems like the thing to do,
don't it?

586
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:42,339
It's your choice.

587
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:44,892
And that's what this has
all been about --

588
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:47,728
the choices
your kind make.

589
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,315
But you're gonna have to weigh
that choice.

590
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:55,352
Ask yourself, "What is it
going to take to do this,"

591
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:59,690
and, "what will the world
be like after it's done?"

592
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,693
Dean?

593
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:04,462
Dean?!

594
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:12,386
Kevin?

595
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:14,338
Hey.

596
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:20,094
We thought we lost you, kiddo.

597
00:40:20,096 --> 00:40:24,515
I'm good.

598
00:40:24,517 --> 00:40:28,552
Second half of the tablet,
and I got it.

599
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:30,855
Third trial.

600
00:40:33,108 --> 00:40:35,443
I didn't tell Crowley.

601
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:39,430
So what is it?

602
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:41,115
To cure a Demon.

603
00:40:46,421 --> 00:40:48,906
Yeah.

604
00:40:50,425 --> 00:40:53,628
Who are you?

605
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,018
Cure a Demon?

606
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,103
Okay, ignoring the fact

607
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:04,188
that I have no idea
what that actually means,

608
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,524
if we -- if we do this,
you get better, right?

609
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:08,893
I mean, you'll stop
trying to cough up a lung

610
00:41:08,895 --> 00:41:11,395
and -- and --
and bumping into furniture?

611
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:14,281
I feel better, yeah,

612
00:41:14,283 --> 00:41:17,568
uh, just having
a direction to move in.

613
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,203
Well, good,

614
00:41:19,205 --> 00:41:20,788
'cause where we're headed
doesn't sound like a picnic.

615
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:24,992
But we're
heading somewhere.

616
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:27,878
The end.

617
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:40,591
Cass?!

618
00:41:42,061 --> 00:41:44,428
A little help here.
