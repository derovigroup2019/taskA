1
00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:02,347
You're freakin' alive.
What the hell happened?

2
00:00:02,471 --> 00:00:03,554
Standing too close
to exploding dick

3
00:00:03,556 --> 00:00:05,256
sends your ass
straight to Purgatory.

4
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:06,978
For the whole year?
Well, how'd you get out?

5
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:11,595
? I think
I'm going to Katmandu ?

6
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:15,149
? that's really,
really where I'm going to ?

7
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:18,536
? If I ever get out of here

8
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:20,872
? that's what I'm gonna do

9
00:00:22,107 --> 00:00:25,276
? K-K-K-K-K-K-Katmandu

10
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:28,546
? I think it's really
where I'm going to ?

11
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:31,666
? If I ever get out of here

12
00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:33,451
? I'm going to Katmandu
Hello, Dean.

13
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:34,969
How the hell
did you make it out?

14
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:37,805
Hello, Castiel. My name
is Naomi. We rescued you.

15
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:39,340
Hell Gates.
What about Hell Gates?

16
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:41,893
The tablet told me all the stuff
about closing the gates of Hell.

17
00:00:41,895 --> 00:00:44,012
Forever.
Her name's Amelia Richardson.

18
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:46,097
She and I had a place together
in Kermit, Texas.

19
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:47,631
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.

20
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,467
What?
I'm just trying to do the right thing here.

21
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,269
You and Don
deserve a chance.

22
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:53,154
Dean Winchester?
You're an angel?

23
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:54,638
My name is Samandriel.

24
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:57,425
There are more tablets?

25
00:00:57,427 --> 00:01:00,728
More than "Leviathan"
and "Demon"?

26
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,113
These are innocent lives
we're talking about.

27
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:03,831
And you're willing to risk that
on Benny's word alone?

28
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,982
Damn right I am.

29
00:01:04,984 --> 00:01:07,535
Lay down your arms,
you unholy thing!

30
00:01:07,537 --> 00:01:10,588
What do you want?
I want your head on a stake.

31
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,374
- No!!
- Is it done?

32
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:15,826
Yeah.
Any casualties?

33
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:17,512
Martin.
Was it Benny?

34
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:18,763
He had it coming, Sam.

35
00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:21,182
? Katmandu

36
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:38,816
Naomi.

37
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:40,985
Naomi, Crowley has me.

38
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:04,342
Ah, ah, ah.

39
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:06,894
Been on angel radio,
have we?

40
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:09,564
No.

41
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:13,985
Don't lie to me,
Alfie.

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,405
I'm not lying.

43
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:19,157
Please,
I wouldn't lie to you.

44
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:23,728
Oh, Alfie,
after all these weeks together.

45
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,330
I mean, how --
how I wish that were so.

46
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,068
Now we're
going to have to...

47
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,755
Turn off that signal...

48
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:36,240
Again.

49
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:37,508
No.

50
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,077
No!

51
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,745
No!

52
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:47,635
N-o-o-o-o-o-o!

55
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,079
Who did you expect?

56
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:32,124
Long drive?

57
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:33,408
Well, I wouldn't have
had to make it

58
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,510
if you hadn't have hung up
on me.

59
00:03:34,512 --> 00:03:36,295
Yeah, well,
I heard all I needed to hear.

60
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:38,079
No, you heard
what you <i>wanted</i> to hear.

61
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:39,715
I told you
Benny wasn't killing.

62
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:42,684
Hell, I watched him end
the fangbanger that was.

63
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:44,219
How about Martin?
How did he end that?

64
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:45,554
Stupid --
just like I said it would.

65
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:47,422
Crazy son of a bitch
didn't give Benny a choice.

66
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:49,558
It was self-defense.

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,692
Seriously, Dean?

68
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:53,228
That's the story
you're going with?

69
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,198
That the vampire
was the real victim here?

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,099
Hey, like it or not,
that's the truth, okay?

71
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:00,202
There was a time when that
actually meant something.

72
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:01,570
Yeah, yeah.
No kidding.

73
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,271
What does that mean?

74
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:05,273
You think this is
just about Benny?

75
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:07,075
What the hell
are you talking about?

76
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:08,427
What the hell do you think
I'm talking about?

77
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:10,496
Amelia?

78
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:11,780
Oh, come on, man.

79
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:14,132
I sent you that text
'cause I needed you to -- to --

80
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:15,918
You needed me to what?

81
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,337
To tear ass to Texas?

82
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,422
To be afraid that what happened
to Jessica,

83
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:22,508
what happened to...
everybody that we care about

84
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,792
might have happened
to her?

85
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:26,311
You were gonna kill Benny.
What was I supposed to do?

86
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,013
Is that what we are?

87
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:31,466
You save a vampire
by making me believe

88
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:33,936
that the woman I love
might be dead?

89
00:04:33,938 --> 00:04:38,106
What do you
want to hear, Sam?

90
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:43,745
That I was wrong?
Fine. I was wrong.

91
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:45,531
Okay?

92
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,315
But if you'd have just
heard me out,

93
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:48,250
if you'd have trusted me,

94
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:49,418
all of this
could have been avoided.

95
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,752
You didn't want me
to trust you.

96
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:54,155
You wanted me to trust Benny,
and I can't do that.

97
00:04:54,157 --> 00:04:57,509
Okay.

98
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:02,764
Okay, well, then,
what the hell do we do now?

99
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:05,384
That depends.

100
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:08,170
It depends on you.

101
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:11,857
On whether or not you're done
with him.

102
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:14,943
Well, honestly,
I don't know.

103
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:27,489
Glad I made the drive.

104
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:40,586
Shh.

105
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,205
Shh.

106
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,477
He's been crying
for two days.

107
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,978
The doctors
missed something.

108
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,516
It's called an inguinal
hernia -- very hard to detect.

109
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:09,031
Castiel,
we have a situation.

110
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,033
Samandriel
has been captured.

111
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:12,918
I thought
Samandriel was dead.

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,203
He's been missing,

113
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:18,573
and now we know --
Crowley has him.

114
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:21,376
Where?
His distress call cut out

115
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:24,046
before I could pinpoint
his exact location,

116
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:26,932
but you will find him
and you will bring him home.

117
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:31,753
Crowley will have warded
against angels this time.

118
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:33,755
I'll need help getting in.
Take whatever you need.

119
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:36,391
But you will be certain,
Castiel,

120
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:38,760
it was your idea
to rescue Samandriel,

121
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:41,113
not mine,
not Heaven's.

122
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:42,430
Do you understand?

123
00:06:58,247 --> 00:06:59,948
Aah.

124
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,583
Damn it, Cass!

125
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:02,784
How many times
I got to tell you...

126
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:04,302
...it's just creepy!

127
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,121
Dean, I need your help.

128
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:07,589
The angel Samandriel...

129
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:10,225
Sam--
...He's been taken.

130
00:07:10,227 --> 00:07:13,528
You mean Alfie,
the wiener-on-a-stick kid?

131
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,330
Yes.

132
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:19,801
I -- I heard his
distress call this morning.

133
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:22,303
On what, angel radio?
I thought you shut that down.

134
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:24,139
Well, my penance,
it's going well,

135
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:26,992
and I thought it was time
to turn it back on.

136
00:07:26,994 --> 00:07:29,477
I've, uh...been
helping people, Dean.

137
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,115
Well, good for you.
All right.

138
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:36,785
So, who snatched heaven's
most adorable angel?

139
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:38,020
Crowley.

140
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:41,023
I'm listening.

141
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:43,041
Samandriel is being held
in the general vicinity

142
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:44,710
of Hastings, Nebraska.

143
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:47,295
"The general vicinity"?
That's all you got?

144
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:49,431
Yes, which is why
I need your help.

145
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:52,167
It seems this is
gonna involve...

146
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,469
talking to people.

147
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:58,807
Come on, Cass, I thought
you were a hunter now.

148
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:03,178
Well...I thought so,
too, but...

149
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,364
It seems I --
I lack a certain --

150
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,150
Skill?

151
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:10,185
You saw nothing.

152
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:20,378
All right.

153
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,713
What am I looking for?

154
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:25,050
Well,
when you torture an angel,

155
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:28,203
it screams,
and that kind of pain,

156
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:30,956
it creates a ripple effect
of strange incidents.

157
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,259
Where's Sam?

158
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:37,212
Sam's gone.

159
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:40,098
It's all right.
We'll, uh, find Alfie ourselves.

160
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,017
<i>This charming</i>
<i>little dung beetle</i>

161
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,436
<i>makes his living</i>
<i>upon the sands of Egypt.</i>

162
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:46,772
<i>Here,</i>
<i>billions of tiny particles,</i>

163
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:49,274
<i>the remnants of ancient seas,</i>
<i>are pushed ever higher</i>

164
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:51,827
<i>by the relentless winds</i>
<i>of the Sahara.</i>

165
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:54,079
<i>This is where the dung beetle</i>
<i>makes its living.</i>

166
00:08:55,082 --> 00:08:56,898
<i>The ancient Egyptians...</i>

167
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,035
Look,
last night at the bar,

168
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:01,837
I just wanted to make sure
it was you.

169
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,741
You know...
peeping in my window.

170
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,178
"Peeping."

171
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,579
You make it sound
so, uh...

172
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,748
Stalker-ish?

173
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,967
Um...

174
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:19,638
Anyway, I ran out
because he was leaving.

175
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,274
He travels a lot
since he's been back.

176
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:25,477
Right, n-no, I get it.
You had someplace...

177
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:26,778
I had to be, yeah.

178
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,596
Are we gonna have
a whole conversation

179
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:30,098
with me finishing
your sentences?

180
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:35,436
So, why <i>are</i> you here?

181
00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:36,955
It's not
what it looks like.

182
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:40,441
I-I thought you were
in trouble -- that you had --

183
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:43,495
It doesn't matter.

184
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:45,914
You're okay.

185
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,916
I <i>was</i> okay.

186
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:52,754
You know,
settled in...content.

187
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:56,558
But here you are.

188
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,894
What am I supposed to do
with that?

189
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,812
Give me five seconds,
and I'll be gone.

190
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:02,814
I didn't come here to make
trouble for you.

191
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:03,965
I-I came because...

192
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:06,985
You cared?

193
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:10,822
See that?

194
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:13,491
I just did it again --

195
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:16,644
finished your sentence.

196
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:23,285
Yeah, I care.

197
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:25,670
I care, too.

198
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,128
I told you
it was an accident.

199
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,763
Yes, of course.

200
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:37,632
But now there shall be
no more accidents,

201
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:41,236
no more angel radio.

202
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:43,838
Stop this, please.
It's been...

203
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,891
...weeks, yes.

204
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,508
We're almost there,
though.

205
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,860
I'm certain of it.

206
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,695
I'm begging you!

207
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:53,732
When we demons
possess a human,

208
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,700
we invade all of them,

209
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:59,788
their muscles,
their...bones, their brains.

210
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:05,026
I can't help but wonder
if it isn't the same for angels.

211
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:07,913
No.

212
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:25,146
Vah-teh-kah-rah.

213
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:29,434
Vah-teh-kah-rah.

214
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:33,554
Vah-teh-kah-rah.

215
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:35,440
Sal-voch-tay.

216
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:39,828
Vah-teh-kah-rah.

217
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,281
Sal-voch-tay.

218
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:45,500
Sal-voch-tay.

219
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:50,121
Sal-voch-tay.

220
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:51,790
Sal-voch-tay!

221
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:27,312
Mr. Hinckley?

222
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:30,899
Hi. Uh, we're from the,
uh, <i>Geneva Gazette.</i>

223
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:35,136
I wanted to ask you a few
questions about your <i>ambush.</i>

224
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,691
Yeah,
well...I'd laugh, too,

225
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,827
if it didn't feel like the sun
just ate my face.

226
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,996
It's a metaphor.

227
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,449
Sorry.

228
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:49,801
Uh, now,
in the police report,

229
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:53,488
it said that the, uh --
the bush talked to you, yeah?

230
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,174
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy,
but, yeah.

231
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,458
And what did it say?

232
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,629
No clue.
Sounded like Klingon to me.

233
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,631
Gonna need exact words.

234
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:04,799
Are you serious?

235
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:08,686
That's his serious face,
yes.

236
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:14,675
As much as you can remember,
Mr. Hinckley.

237
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:19,747
Sounded something like...
"Sol-voch."

238
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:24,652
Yeah.
"Sol-voch-tay."

239
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:30,652
Well, what do you think?
Mean anything to you?

240
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:33,538
Yes. It's Enochian.
It means "obey."

241
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,940
"Obey"? Obey what?
I don't know.

242
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:38,626
But the amount of pain
an angel must be in

243
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:41,879
not just to manifest through
shrubbery but to burn --

244
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:44,916
Dean...We have to find him
before it's too late.

245
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:46,801
Okay.

246
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:48,836
Okay, well, look,
a sign like that --

247
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:50,972
Alfie can't be too far,
right?

248
00:13:50,974 --> 00:13:54,392
So we'll just start at the bush
and work our way out.

249
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:57,461
And look for what exactly?
Crowley could have him anywhere.

250
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:58,462
Well, if I know Crowley,

251
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,231
the place will be swarming
with demons,

252
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,233
so we'll just drive
till we see ugly.

253
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,438
It's official --
I hate motels.

254
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,326
Say something.

255
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:15,446
What would you
like me to say?

256
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:21,919
"That was great"?
"That was...a mistake"?

257
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:25,256
I don't know.
Both, I guess.

258
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:31,996
I understand.

259
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:33,598
Do you?

260
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,935
Do you understand
I have a life here?

261
00:14:37,937 --> 00:14:41,338
A good man
that loves me --

262
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,558
a man
I don't want to hurt?

263
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,893
I know.

264
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:48,229
And do you know you're
the first thing I think about

265
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:50,031
when I wake up
in the morning

266
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:52,750
and the last thing
before I go to sleep?

267
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:58,188
It's tough to let
something like that go.

268
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,575
Yeah.

269
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:03,294
Especially if you keep
showing up here.

270
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:06,964
Are you saying
you want me to leave?

271
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:09,500
I'm telling you
that if you stay,

272
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:14,989
against everything I believe in,
I would be with you.

273
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:19,660
But if you leave...

274
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:21,412
Don't come back.

275
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:26,216
I can't have you with one foot
in my life

276
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,653
and one foot
out there doing...

277
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,154
Whatever it is you do.

278
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:33,891
That life of yours
I have no idea about.

279
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:35,860
You don't
want to know about it.

280
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:37,061
Believe me.

281
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:39,330
It's a big step.

282
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,083
For me or you?

283
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:43,985
Both.

284
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:47,788
I...need to think
about this.

285
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,292
You need to
think about this.

286
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:54,629
Words will never cover
what you mean to me --

287
00:15:54,631 --> 00:15:57,715
what you'll always mean to me,
but we should...

288
00:15:57,717 --> 00:15:59,216
Think about it.

289
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,588
Okay.

290
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,641
How about two days
from now...

291
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:08,359
around 7:30?

292
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:10,361
I'll be off work then.

293
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:15,700
One of us will be here,
and we'll know.

294
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:20,071
Neither of us
will be here...

295
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:21,872
and we'll know.

296
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:27,945
Or both of us
will be here...

297
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:29,797
and we'll know.

298
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:57,992
Wow,
will you look at that?

299
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:00,027
Our ninth
abandoned factory.

300
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:01,245
Ain't that America?

301
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:03,280
Hey, what do you say,
this doesn't pan out,

302
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,449
we head back to that
beer-and-bacon happy hour

303
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:07,118
about a mile back, huh?

304
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,869
Wait a minute, Dean.

305
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:11,422
Those derelicts,
they're demons.

306
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:13,874
I can see
their true faces.

307
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:18,929
Crowley's got that many
hell monkeys outside,

308
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:21,799
he's got to have
at least double inside.

309
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:25,469
And Angel Warding.
I can feel it.

310
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:28,105
Well, you, me, and a demon knife
ain't gonna cut it.

311
00:17:28,107 --> 00:17:31,058
Okay. I'll get Sam.

312
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,177
No.
We don't need Sam.

313
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:34,278
But you just said --

314
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,864
Look, if Sam wanted in,
he'd be here, okay?

315
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,402
I got a better idea.

316
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,054
Slow read?

317
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,076
Slowest.

318
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:07,011
Where's Garth?

319
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:09,397
Supply run?
I don't know.

320
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:13,217
Sort of lost track
of when he comes and goes.

321
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:15,319
You guys need help
with something?

322
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:16,987
I'm working here.

323
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:19,323
You look horrible.

324
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:21,776
Yeah. Thanks.

325
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:24,028
He's right.
Are you okay, Kevin?

326
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,946
Fine.

327
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:29,383
I'm just...
in the middle of this.

328
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:32,119
And? Any luck?

329
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:34,038
Interpreting
half a Demon tablet?

330
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,573
No.

331
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,343
I got nothing.

332
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:41,295
All right,
well, buck up,

333
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:45,466
'cause, uh, we need some more
of that demon TNT ASAP.

334
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:47,051
You used it all?

335
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:49,437
Yeah, so let's whip up
another batch.

336
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:50,855
Sure.

337
00:18:50,857 --> 00:18:54,108
West Bank witch hazel,
skull of Egyptian calf,

338
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,526
the tail of
some random-ass newt

339
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:56,861
that may or may not
be extinct --

340
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:58,362
All right, all right,
I get it --

341
00:18:58,364 --> 00:18:59,947
ingredients are hard
to come by, huh?

342
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:01,699
That's just
the first three ingredients.

343
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:05,319
Give me the list.
I'll get what we need.

344
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:09,206
Well...

345
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,672
What on earth could you possibly
need now, Viggo?

346
00:19:24,674 --> 00:19:27,925
I've given you every torture
instrument known to man --

347
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:29,927
short of
a Neil Diamond album.

348
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,563
I've found something, sir.
I need a translator.

349
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:34,181
You're looking at him.

350
00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:36,066
Show me.

351
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:43,474
Zoh-bah-leh-ta.

352
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:45,809
What have we here?

353
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:48,696
I think it's Enochian.

354
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:51,481
Of course it's Enochian,
you pigeon.

355
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,935
The question is,
why is he speaking Enochian?

356
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:58,038
What have you drilled into here,
Viggo, huh?

357
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,208
Zoh-bah-leh-ta.

358
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,677
Sah-teh-voch-leh.

359
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,779
Bollocks.

360
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:07,882
What is it, sir?

361
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:15,689
Well, what our feathered friend
was uttering essentially was,

362
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:17,007
"You, celestial being,

363
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,710
have been created to be an angel
of the Lord."

364
00:20:21,313 --> 00:20:23,831
You've got
into his operating system --

365
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,016
his factory settings.

366
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,452
From who? God?

367
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:30,654
Who the hell cares
where it comes from?

368
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:33,624
Let's find out what makes
this flying monkey tick.

369
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:42,049
Sah-teh-voch-leh.

370
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:07,157
I mean, come on.

371
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:10,945
How long's it take to get
a calf skull from Egypt?

372
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,667
Kevin.

373
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:17,851
Kevin.

374
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:30,130
Your mom's hot.

375
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:32,850
I'm serious,
your mom is one sexy --

376
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:41,525
Hey, I thought I told you
to go underground.

377
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:43,193
Hey.

378
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:44,228
I am so far underground,

379
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,762
I'm breathing
through a straw, brother.

380
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:49,400
Uh, look...

381
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:52,236
What happened with your friend
Martin back there,

382
00:21:52,238 --> 00:21:54,571
it wasn't supposed
to go down that way.

383
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:56,390
I know.
Your granddaughter told me.

384
00:21:56,392 --> 00:22:00,244
Dean, you did this old dog
a real solid,

385
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:03,714
and, uh...the way
you stood up for me --

386
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:06,500
Well, shoe on the other foot,
you would have done the same.

387
00:22:06,502 --> 00:22:08,452
Yeah.

388
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:09,503
I hate to ask for much else,

389
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:11,088
but I don't suppose
there's any chance

390
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,573
you're anywhere near
the Catskills?

391
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:13,957
Working a case on the other side
of the country.

392
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,225
Why? What's up?

393
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:18,429
Yeah, just hitting a little
rough patch, I guess.

394
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:20,931
You know,
doing this whole solo thing.

395
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:24,401
Benny...
One day at a time, man.

396
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:26,153
You know what?

397
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:29,657
Uh...A cup of coffee
sure would do me good.

398
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:31,141
All right, as soon as I'm done
with this case,

399
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:34,028
I'll, uh...
I'll be there, okay?

400
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,946
Yeah.

401
00:22:35,948 --> 00:22:39,333
All right, brother.
Thank you.

402
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:50,177
Hey.

403
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:52,662
Where <i>is</i> your mom?

404
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,831
Somewhere safe.

405
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,000
You kicked your mom
to the curb?

406
00:22:57,002 --> 00:23:00,304
She was too distracting.

407
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:02,022
I couldn't focus.

408
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:04,525
The angels said
I had to go to the desert

409
00:23:04,527 --> 00:23:06,777
to learn the word of God,
all right?

410
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,063
So...This is my desert.

411
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:11,065
Yeah,
but your mom's your mom.

412
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:15,069
I can't enjoy a world
I need to save, Dean.

413
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:17,588
I can enjoy it
when this is all over with.

414
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,406
For right now...

415
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:22,426
There's nothing more important
than this.

416
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:43,514
Watching humanity --
it never gets old, does it?

417
00:23:50,322 --> 00:23:51,522
I got what we need.

418
00:23:51,524 --> 00:23:53,657
Oh, it's about time.

419
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,077
What's he doing here?

420
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:00,564
Don't worry, Dean.

421
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,899
Once we save Alfie,
I'm out.

422
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,035
Oh, once "we" save Alfie.
Don't hurt yourself, Sam.

423
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:06,070
Cass and I can handle it.

424
00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:07,421
Not according to Cass.

425
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:09,022
I told you
we didn't need him.

426
00:24:09,024 --> 00:24:12,309
We need <i>everything,</i>
Dean.

427
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:17,965
And I need both of you,
as you say, to stow your crap.

428
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:19,183
Can you do that?

429
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:52,961
So, there are four
main points of warding --

430
00:24:52,962 --> 00:24:54,395
north, south, east,
and west --

431
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,860
and four Enochian symbols,

432
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:01,964
like this,
that you need to destroy

433
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:03,049
before I can enter.

434
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:04,200
Okay, so, what?

435
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,484
We go in,
take care of the hell mooks,

436
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:07,036
and you extract
the angel?

437
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,537
Yes.

438
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:09,705
After killing so many,

439
00:25:09,707 --> 00:25:12,808
I need to save
at least this one.

440
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:16,329
Sounds like a plan.

441
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:19,732
Okay. Let's do this.

442
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:21,884
Wait. Here.

443
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:23,236
This doesn't just work
on angels.

444
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:24,971
It kills demons, too.

445
00:25:27,157 --> 00:25:29,992
Thanks, Cass.

446
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:52,882
Aah!

447
00:25:58,088 --> 00:26:02,191
Well, not my most
original work, but...

448
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:03,753
Voh-meh-pah-rah-less.

449
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:08,291
Voh-meh-pah-rah-less.

450
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,843
What is it?

451
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:14,130
<i>That</i> was tablet talk.

452
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,514
Protecting the Word of God

453
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:18,768
seems to be hardwired
into these dingbats.

454
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,684
Thanks.

455
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,369
Come on.

456
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,527
Zod-leh-fah.

457
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:56,065
"Demon tablet."
Tell me one I don't know, huh?

458
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,406
Alfie.

459
00:29:31,318 --> 00:29:33,936
M-m-Mr. Crowley,
not that this isn't important,

460
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,772
but perhaps we should be making
preparations to leave.

461
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,691
We -- we seem to be
under attack.

462
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,494
Did you say something?

463
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,598
All right,
anytime now, Cass.

464
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:08,804
Cass! Hey!
You okay?

465
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:11,106
It must be the sigils.

466
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,943
I'm not at full power.

467
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,694
Sam,
help me muss this crud.

468
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:17,229
No, wait!
There's no time.

469
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:19,448
Samandriel won't last
much longer.

470
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,016
Cass.

471
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:23,152
Here, take this.

472
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,627
Dean, hurry up.

473
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,962
Come on!

474
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:45,891
All right.
Plan "B."

475
00:30:45,893 --> 00:30:47,343
We have a plan "B"?

476
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:57,353
As you were saying?

477
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,939
Bah-nah-sah-ee.

478
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:04,393
Cass? Anytime now.

479
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,399
Yes?

480
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:13,786
Ar-doh-zah-feh.

481
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,905
Spit it out,
you heavenly pile of filth!

482
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,576
Pah-deh-rah.

483
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,578
Holy mother of sin.

484
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,015
What? What is it?

485
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:30,653
There's an Angel tablet.

486
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,991
Hold still.

487
00:32:56,495 --> 00:32:59,280
Wait!
I know -- I know things.

488
00:32:59,282 --> 00:33:02,834
Cass! Go!

489
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:07,171
Good, good.
There's so much you don't know.

490
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:08,756
You <i>need</i> me.

491
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:11,092
Yeah.

492
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:13,428
Yeah, I don't think so.

493
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:23,137
It's okay.
You're safe now.

494
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:24,839
I'm taking you home.

495
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:27,692
No. You can't take me
back there, Castiel.

496
00:33:27,694 --> 00:33:29,360
Why not?

497
00:33:29,362 --> 00:33:31,479
You don't understand.

498
00:33:31,481 --> 00:33:34,198
I told Crowley...
Things --

499
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,184
things
he shouldn't have known.

500
00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:39,487
He got to our coding,
our secrets --

501
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:41,339
secrets I didn't even know
we had!

502
00:33:41,341 --> 00:33:42,657
What secrets?

503
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,543
Heaven, Naomi.

504
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:47,211
No. W-who's Naomi?

505
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:49,530
Who is --

506
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:52,216
listen to me.
Listen to me closely.

507
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:54,218
I've been there.
I know!

508
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,554
They're controlling us,
Castiel!

509
00:33:56,556 --> 00:33:58,222
What do you mean?

510
00:33:58,224 --> 00:33:59,440
Kill him!

511
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:01,776
What does he mean,
"they're controlling us"?

512
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:02,860
Castiel!

513
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:07,315
Who is controlling us?
Why did I see your face?

514
00:34:07,317 --> 00:34:09,400
Why was I so afraid?
What did you do to me?

515
00:34:09,402 --> 00:34:12,303
This is a direct order!
Kill him!

516
00:34:34,843 --> 00:34:36,311
What did I just do?

517
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:38,479
You killed a traitor.

518
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:41,199
Samandriel...was good.

519
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:43,267
And I was trying
to atone for --

520
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:45,303
Samandriel was broken.

521
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:48,556
He revealed the existence of
what I would die to protect --

522
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:50,908
what any of us
would die to protect.

523
00:34:52,244 --> 00:34:55,363
The Angel tablet,
Castiel.

524
00:34:55,365 --> 00:34:56,831
Crowley knows.

525
00:34:56,833 --> 00:35:01,452
I just murdered one of our own
to protect a tablet?

526
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:08,259
If the Demon tablet
can seal demons in hell,

527
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:11,095
what do you think the Angel
tablet could do to us?

528
00:35:12,581 --> 00:35:14,515
You're a hero, Castiel.

529
00:35:14,517 --> 00:35:17,719
You've done Heaven
a great service.

530
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:20,388
And that's what I tell
Sam and Dean?

531
00:35:23,442 --> 00:35:27,028
Cass!
What the hell happened?

532
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,279
You tell the Winchesters

533
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:30,481
that Samandriel
had been compromised.

534
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:33,985
He was compromised.

535
00:35:33,987 --> 00:35:36,904
He came at you,
and you acted in self-defense.

536
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:39,540
He came at me.

537
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:42,827
I killed him
in self-defense.

538
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:45,446
Say you must return
his body to Heaven,

539
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:47,248
and then bring him to me.

540
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:50,468
Cass, you okay?

541
00:35:55,174 --> 00:35:59,727
My vessel must have been damaged
in the melee.

542
00:35:59,729 --> 00:36:01,562
I have to go.

543
00:36:01,564 --> 00:36:05,066
Samandriel's remains
belong in Heaven.

544
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:10,605
I need to see just how far
Crowley dug into him.

545
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:15,109
Do you understand?

546
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:18,946
Yes, I understand.

547
00:36:21,366 --> 00:36:22,784
Cass, wait.

548
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:25,453
Thank you both...

549
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:28,840
For everything
you've done.

550
00:36:28,842 --> 00:36:32,376
Cass!

551
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:02,267
Okay.
That should do it.

552
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:05,604
Cass can't see or hear us now.

553
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:07,572
Okay, what the hell?
I know.

554
00:37:07,574 --> 00:37:09,641
I told you something was off with him
since he got back from Purgatory.

555
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,076
So, what, you think someone's
messing with him or something?

556
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:12,661
Who?
Angels?

557
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,447
Why would the angels have him
kill <i>another</i> angel?

558
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,216
You know what, man?
I got this.

559
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:24,634
You go.

560
00:37:24,636 --> 00:37:26,486
What?

561
00:37:26,488 --> 00:37:29,272
Don't you have a girl
to get back to?

562
00:37:29,274 --> 00:37:33,327
Yeah. I guess I do.
Um...

563
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,898
Since when are you
on the Amelia bandwagon?

564
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,118
I don't know.

565
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,588
I'm just tired
of all the fighting.

566
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,626
And, you know, maybe
I'm a...little bit jealous.

567
00:37:49,628 --> 00:37:52,679
I could never separate myself
from the job like you could.

568
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,271
Hell, maybe it's time for at least one
of us to be happy.

569
00:37:57,273 --> 00:37:58,806
What, you being
such a big hugger and all?

570
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,774
She does make me happy,

571
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:08,943
and she could be waiting for me
if I went back.

572
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:12,813
I'd be a...very lucky man
if she was.

573
00:38:14,316 --> 00:38:16,233
But now...

574
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:18,652
with everything
staring down at us,

575
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:22,022
with all that's left
to be done...

576
00:38:22,024 --> 00:38:24,608
I don't know.

577
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,861
Huh.

578
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:28,796
Yeah.

579
00:38:28,798 --> 00:38:34,718
Well, I do know this --
whatever you decide...decide.

580
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,921
Both feet in
or both feet out.

581
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:40,007
Anything in between
is what gets you dead.

582
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:42,977
Yeah,
I keep hearing that.

583
00:38:44,513 --> 00:38:51,068
I'm gonna...take a walk.
Clear my head.

584
00:39:31,927 --> 00:39:33,594
Dean.

585
00:39:33,596 --> 00:39:35,563
Thank you mightily, bud.

586
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:38,832
I'm in a hard way here.
How close are you?

587
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:44,104
I'm sorry, man.
I, um...I'm not gonna make it.

588
00:39:44,106 --> 00:39:46,991
You mean now, or...?

589
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:49,126
Listen, Benny.

590
00:39:49,128 --> 00:39:53,497
Everything you've done for me
I will never forget,

591
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:57,167
but, uh...

592
00:39:57,169 --> 00:39:59,953
This is it.

593
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:02,640
End of the line?

594
00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:07,628
End of the line.

595
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:11,515
Yeah, well, I never liked
these cellphones anyway.

596
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:13,651
You, uh...

597
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:16,770
You stay good,
all right?

598
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:18,405
You too, Dean.

599
00:40:18,407 --> 00:40:20,774
And, uh...

600
00:40:20,776 --> 00:40:22,409
Thanks for the ride.

601
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:24,862
Yeah, man.

602
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:28,735
Adios.

603
00:40:45,324 --> 00:40:50,324
