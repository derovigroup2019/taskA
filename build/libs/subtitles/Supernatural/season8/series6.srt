1
00:00:01,644 --> 00:00:03,409
Hey. You Dean?
Hey, Garth.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,842
Garth.
Garth.

3
00:00:04,844 --> 00:00:06,543
Oh, Marmaduke, you're crazy!

4
00:00:06,545 --> 00:00:08,543
He grows on you.

5
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:13,614
What'd I miss?

6
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:15,248
<i>You're right.
He has grown on me.</i>

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,549
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

8
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,616
I don't hunt anymore.

9
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:20,884
- You quit?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:22,986
What could possibly
make you stop just like that?

11
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:24,586
Was there a girl?

12
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:26,521
Yeah. Amelia.

13
00:00:26,523 --> 00:00:28,655
- All right, what about you?
- What about me?

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,493
I'm Benny.

15
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:46,198
I can see you two have
a lot to talk about.

16
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,451
Hey, hon.

17
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:17,853
Just in time.

18
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:19,287
Grab me a cold one,
would ya?

19
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:22,423
Why don't you have Sara Alcott
get it for you?!

20
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,291
What?

21
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:28,728
Oh, my God!

22
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,296
Mary, help!

23
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:32,999
Mary, what are you doing?!

24
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:34,533
Mary, what are you doing?!

25
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:35,500
Mary! Mary, help me!
Get the...

26
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:37,035
Aah! Mary!

27
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:40,070
Mary! No!

28
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:42,205
Aaaaaaah!

31
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:55,649
Heads up.

32
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:58,051
I caught wind of a case
on this police scanner.

33
00:01:58,053 --> 00:01:59,753
Sounds like
our kind of thing.

34
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,622
I wasn't even gone
10 minutes.

35
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,524
Okay.
That matters why?

36
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:06,725
I don't know, Dean.

37
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,493
How about because you haven't
said a word to me

38
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,527
since Prentiss Island?

39
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,528
And now, what?

40
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,996
You want me to shut up
and ride shotgun

41
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,898
and act
like nothing happened?

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,900
You want to talk
about Benny?

43
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:19,336
- Fine. Let's talk.
- Okay.

44
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:22,338
<i>How about he's a vampire?</i>

45
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,739
He's also the reason
I'm topside

46
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,507
and not roasting on a spit
in Purgatory.

47
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:26,508
Anything else?

48
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,708
Don't pretend
I don't get it.

49
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,410
I know you had to do
what you had to down there.

50
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:31,678
I highly doubt you get anything
about Purgatory.

51
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,447
But you're out now,
and Benny's still breathing.

52
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:35,648
Why?

53
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:39,851
He's my friend, Sam.

54
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:44,422
And what about my friend, Amy?
She was what?

55
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:47,157
'Cause you sure as hell didn't
have a problem ganking her.

56
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,292
Well, I guess people change,
don't they?

57
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,327
We let that werewolf Kate go,
didn't we?

58
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,729
She was different.
She...

59
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:54,564
you think
Benny's different?

60
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:57,839
He tell you he's not
drinking live blood, or something.

61
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:04,268
And you believe him.
Wow.

62
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,037
<i>Okay. You know, you're right.
People do change.</i>

63
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,040
Yeah.
I got a vampire buddy,

64
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:11,042
and you turn your phone off
for a year.

65
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:13,110
Don't turn this on me.

66
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,512
Look, Benny slips up

67
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:19,049
and some other hunter
turns his lights out, so be it.

68
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:22,420
But it's not gonna be you,
right?

69
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,259
You coming or not?

70
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:42,909
So,
guy's old lady comes home

71
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:44,810
while he's working
underneath his ride,

72
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:47,580
puts the pedal to the metal,
and takes half his head off.

73
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:48,481
What, that's it?

74
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:49,783
Yeah, in a nutshell.

75
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:52,986
She says she blacked out,
doesn't remember a damn thing.

76
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:54,587
Well,
sounds like insanity.

77
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:55,722
Maybe.

78
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:57,590
So, how does that make this
our kind of thing?

79
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:02,395
Because, Sam,
Kevin's in the wind, okay,

80
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:04,197
you're sulking around
like a eunuch in a whorehouse,

81
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,365
and I can't help
but ask myself,

82
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,534
when is decapitation
not my thing?

83
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:15,208
Whoa, whoa.

84
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:17,577
FBI?

85
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,646
Yeah, happened to be
in the neighborhood.

86
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:22,181
First a Texas Ranger,
now you guys?

87
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:23,683
Texas Ranger?

88
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:27,687
Yes, sir.
Right over there.

89
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,392
Oh,
you got to be kidding me.

90
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,638
Hey, Chuck Norris.

91
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:49,710
Sam? Dean!

92
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:52,279
Forgot he was a hugger.

93
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:54,148
- Come here!
- All right. Okay.

94
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:56,817
We're still...
we're still working here.

95
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,419
Uh, you guys have no idea
how much I missed you.

96
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:01,354
Um,
excuse us, would you?

97
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:03,023
Yeah,
we'll be right back.

98
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,294
<i>A Texas Ranger, Garth?
Seriously? We're in Missouri.</i>

99
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:09,429
What? Come on.

100
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,731
I look like a funeral director
in one of those.

101
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:14,300
Wow.

102
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:16,469
I heard some chatter you two
were back in the batter's box,

103
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:18,438
but I didn't believe it
till now.

104
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,907
Oh, uh, one sec.

105
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:25,111
Um...

106
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:28,681
Yo, Earl.
What you got?

107
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:30,048
A revenant.

108
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,085
Okay, uh, you'll need a casket
and some silver spikes.

109
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,154
Oh, and don't get bit.

110
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:37,723
No, it won't turn you,
but it will hurt like hell.

111
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:39,559
Okay, so,
once you got all that,

112
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:42,428
nail that sucker in, bury him,
and throw away the key.

113
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,596
Okay?

114
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:45,898
All right. Hasta.

115
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,033
What are you doing?

116
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:48,434
My job, hombre.

117
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:50,403
- Your "job"?
- Yeah.

118
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:53,240
And since when is
giving advice your job?

119
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:55,442
Hold up.
Are you the new Bobby?

120
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:56,776
You shut your mouth.

121
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:58,111
Yes.

122
00:05:58,113 --> 00:05:59,613
You shut your mouth.

123
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:02,549
What?!

124
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:04,684
Bobby was gone.
You two were MIA.

125
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:06,018
It was a weird time.

126
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:09,989
Somebody had to step in
and take up the slack.

127
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:12,658
All right.

128
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,226
Let's just
get back to work,

129
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:17,429
and we'll talk about this later,
all right?

130
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:20,632
Did Garth just tell us
what to do?

131
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:23,402
Uh, Scott Lew.

132
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:25,137
These gentlemen here
are with the FBI.

133
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,073
Mr. Lew's parents were
the individuals involved

134
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:29,475
in this...
unfortunate situation.

135
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:30,443
Sorry for your loss.

136
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,112
Just a few questions,
Mr. Lew.

137
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:33,346
Um, by any chance

138
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:36,383
were your parents having...
marital problems?

139
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:39,687
No.
Uh, no more than anyone else.

140
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:41,088
What about
your mother's health?

141
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,689
Any chance this was
a seizure, a stroke,

142
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,725
anything that might
help explain this?

143
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:46,126
I don't think so.

144
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:48,662
Um, they're checking her out
at the, um, hospital right now.

145
00:06:48,664 --> 00:06:50,597
What about
stranger behavior?

146
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:52,666
Stranger? How?

147
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:54,034
Hearing voices,
seeing things...

148
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,669
your mother mention anything
like that?

149
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:59,440
My parents were married
for 30 years...

150
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:00,708
high-school sweethearts.

151
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,576
There's no good explanation
for why this happened,

152
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:04,244
no matter
where you want to look.

153
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,515
Okay, well,
thank you, Scott.

154
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:10,751
We'll be in touch.

155
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:24,165
No EMF.

156
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:26,067
No traces of sulfur
anywhere.

157
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,337
Like I thought... bust.

158
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,471
Hold on there, Sam.

159
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:32,206
There's a lot of things
to factor in here.

160
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,474
Uh, it happened
last night,

161
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:35,176
so the readings
could be cold by now.

162
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:36,310
Good point.

163
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:38,813
And, uh,
even if there was any sulfur,

164
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,448
Barney Fife and his crew

165
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,117
probably contaminated
the whole crime scene

166
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,852
and any evidence
that was here with it.

167
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,887
Wow.
He's on a roll.

168
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,622
That's one word for it.

169
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:51,593
Uh, guys,
I think I found something.

170
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,732
Is that gum,
or is that ectoplasm?

171
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:59,301
Ectoplasm is usually black,
right?

172
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:03,472
Mm.

173
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:06,108
Definitely ectoplasm.

174
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,710
So, what are we thinking...
uh, some kind of ghost, right?

175
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,820
Uh,
Ranger McCrae here.

176
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:19,589
One of those things rings
Hammer, I'm throwing down.

177
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:21,824
Oh, great.

178
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:22,959
Okay.

179
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:29,198
Okay.

180
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,766
Thanks, Doc.

181
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:32,835
Asked the coroner
to drop me a line

182
00:08:32,837 --> 00:08:35,538
in case the autopsy turned up
anything... unusual.

183
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,640
And guess what.

184
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,678
Our dead guy had the word
"Alcott" carved into his chest.

185
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,979
With what?

186
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,748
Coroner's best guess?

187
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,417
His wife Mary's
fingernails.

188
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:50,654
Mrs. Lew, can you tell us
what happened?

189
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,791
I was at the store
getting groceries,

190
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:55,360
and the next thing I know,

191
00:08:55,362 --> 00:09:00,265
my son Scott finds me
in the driveway.

192
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:03,368
And Chester was...

193
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:09,008
Do you remember anything at all
about what happened?

194
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,978
Um... Chester dying?

195
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,447
Not really.

196
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:18,083
Bits and pieces, I guess.

197
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:26,925
Such as?

198
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:31,363
I remember his screams...

199
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:34,266
the smell of burnt rubber,
and...

200
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:37,369
I remember feeling
so angry...

201
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:41,272
just uncontrollable rage,
like I wasn't myself.

202
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:45,643
And after it was over,
all that anger was...

203
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:47,846
it was gone.

204
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:52,717
Uh, ma'am, does the word
"Alcott" mean anything to you?

205
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:57,856
What does she have to do
with anything?

206
00:09:57,858 --> 00:10:00,025
It's a she?

207
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:03,128
My husband, Chester, and I
were going steady in high school

208
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,798
for a few years already
when we had a big fight.

209
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,932
What about?

210
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:09,302
Something stupid,
I'm sure.

211
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:10,870
It was around prom,

212
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:13,974
and so he took Sara Alcott
as his date instead of me.

213
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:15,876
So, this Sara Alcott
was a rival

214
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:17,611
for your husband's
affections?

215
00:10:17,613 --> 00:10:20,180
Sara had
one night with him,

216
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:23,450
whereas I was with Chester
for 37 years.

217
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:25,385
Of course, right.
Sure.

218
00:10:25,387 --> 00:10:27,588
Um,
just one more question.

219
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,957
Um

220
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,993
Is... Ms. Alcott still alive?

221
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:35,095
As far as I know,
yes.

222
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:39,000
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Lew.

223
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:40,668
Let me get this straight.

224
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,505
This poor guy goes to prom with
some girl over 30 years ago,

225
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:45,906
and because of that,
he is now a pancake?

226
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:47,541
I mean,
if this is a ghost,

227
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:49,776
maybe it's some sort of possession?
What are you talking about?

228
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:51,311
You heard her.
Alcott's alive.

229
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:53,414
Well, we're definitely gonna
want to talk to her.

230
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,883
Yeah,
sounds like a plan.

231
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:57,484
Did we eat yet?

232
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:05,026
Mmm. Thanks.

233
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:07,194
Keep 'em coming.
All right.

234
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:10,965
So, Dean,
give me the skinny.

235
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:13,034
Where were you
this past year?

236
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:16,404
Why don't we save what I did
on my summer vacation

237
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:17,672
for another time?

238
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:19,907
Aw, come on.

239
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:22,609
All right.

240
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:24,845
I was in Purgatory.

241
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:29,883
<i>Like
the Purgatory Purgatory?</i>

242
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:32,986
No, the one in Miami.

243
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:35,655
Man, that's balls.

244
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:38,158
That's not how you say
"balls."

245
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,227
So how'd you get out?

246
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:48,802
What's up with all
the, uh, hillbilly hankies?

247
00:11:48,804 --> 00:11:50,836
These people know
the civil war's over, right?

248
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:51,472
Mm.

249
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:54,674
That's a touchy subject
around these parts.

250
00:11:54,676 --> 00:11:57,244
See, Missouri was
a border state.

251
00:11:57,246 --> 00:11:59,812
So, half the men
were Confederate,

252
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:01,280
the other half
were the Union.

253
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:03,149
How do you know all this?

254
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:05,385
I went to college.

255
00:12:05,387 --> 00:12:06,686
You went to college?

256
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:07,854
Yeah.

257
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:09,822
College,
and on to dental school.

258
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:12,224
What, you...
you were a dentist?

259
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:14,160
Yeah, just for, like,
a hot minute.

260
00:12:14,162 --> 00:12:16,095
Where'd you think I got
my first case?

261
00:12:16,097 --> 00:12:20,066
Let me guess...
Tooth Fairy.

262
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:30,876
Yeah.

263
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:35,114
Man, I felt terrible
when I ganked that S.O.B.

264
00:12:35,116 --> 00:12:37,784
Uh,
you killed the Tooth Fairy?

265
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:39,218
Yeah, man.

266
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,788
I mean, not my proudest moment,
but  it happened.

267
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,591
Mmm.

268
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:51,430
Man, this is good.

269
00:12:51,432 --> 00:12:52,598
Mmm.

270
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:00,740
Hey, hon.

271
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:03,176
Uh, just, uh, grabbing some joe
on the way to the hospital,

272
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:04,677
gonna bring mom her stuff.

273
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,979
Oh, crap.

274
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:07,880
Jeff's here.

275
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:11,684
Don't worry,
I'll be fine.

276
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:14,721
Okay.

277
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:17,122
Love you.

278
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:45,884
Hey, Scott, how's...

279
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:49,154
uh, look, I heard about
what happened with your folks.

280
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:50,589
I'm really sorry.

281
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:51,757
If there's...
there's anything...

282
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,992
I mean, anything...
that I can do,

283
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:54,560
just...
just ask, man. Please.

284
00:13:54,562 --> 00:13:57,029
How about getting me
my money back, Jeff?!

285
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:58,364
Oh!

286
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:30,705
So, first the mom goes
"Natural Born Killer,"

287
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:32,574
and now the son?

288
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:35,910
Well, what do we got...
a ghost with an oedipus complex?

289
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:38,045
I don't know
what that means.

290
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:39,280
Check that out.

291
00:14:39,282 --> 00:14:41,149
"Sussex."

292
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,683
What is that,
another name?

293
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:44,452
I don't know.

294
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:45,720
Hey,
what'd the cops say?

295
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:48,489
Aw, come on.

296
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,692
Not much.

297
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,660
Uh, Scott insisted he wasn't
in control of himself.

298
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:55,495
Says all he remembers
is a red-hot rage.

299
00:14:55,497 --> 00:14:58,465
So, what is this, some...
some kind of family curse?

300
00:14:58,467 --> 00:14:59,766
Is that Bobby's hat?

301
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:01,401
Oh, yeah. Sure is.

302
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:04,771
We worked a rugaru case together
a few years back.

303
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:07,074
He left it in my car,
so I kept it as a...

304
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:08,609
memento.

305
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:11,412
What are you doing?!
That's not how you wear it.

306
00:15:11,414 --> 00:15:14,181
Gentlemen,
surveillance is up,

307
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:17,551
but something
is all screwy with it.

308
00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:25,258
Must be the camera.

309
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,196
Yeah, thank you,
there, deputy.

310
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:30,197
You guys see the head?

311
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:31,965
Ever seen anything like that
before?

312
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,000
Like that? No way.

313
00:15:34,002 --> 00:15:35,001
So?

314
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:36,236
So?

315
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:38,004
So, I'm thinking we need to talk
to Sara Alcott.

316
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:41,108
I found her... although these
days, she goes by Sara Brown.

317
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,676
How about this?

318
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:45,044
I'll check her out, and you two
see what you can find out about Sussex.

319
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:46,012
Word.

320
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:47,380
Awesome.

321
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,820
Mmm.

322
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:56,289
Now, I know you didn't come
all this way

323
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,458
for my sweet tea, Agent.

324
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,693
No.

325
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:02,563
Um, actually, I'm...
I'm here about Chester Lew.

326
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:03,997
Oh, yes.

327
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:05,365
So sad.

328
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:06,533
It is.

329
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:10,337
Is it true you and Chester...
dated a ways back?

330
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,673
Well, that is an odd question
for the FBI, isn't it?

331
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,044
You wouldn't believe
the awkward questions

332
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:18,312
I've had to ask people.

333
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:19,413
Yeah.

334
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:21,915
Well yes.
Yes.

335
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:26,053
Me and that old tomcat, Chester,
we went to prom together.

336
00:16:26,055 --> 00:16:27,354
That's about it.

337
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:29,656
And that's all?

338
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:34,728
Well, I wasn't exactly
a good girl,

339
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,163
if that's what you mean.

340
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:38,966
And after that,

341
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:41,802
I-I thought that Chester and I
were gonna be hot and heavy.

342
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:44,572
But it just wasn't
meant to be.

343
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:48,175
And, uh, a week later,
he eloped with Mary.

344
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:51,177
Did you speak much to Mary
or Chester again after that?

345
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:55,381
Well, I'd see them about,
you know... picnics and such.

346
00:16:55,383 --> 00:16:59,117
But... Mary kept Chester
on a pretty short leash.

347
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:02,987
Honestly, I'd moved on,
but it seems she never did.

348
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,923
And why do you think
that is?

349
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,592
Well,
I guess in her mind,

350
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:11,263
I was a reminder
of Chester's betrayal.

351
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:12,364
Huh.

352
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,534
So, if that's all...

353
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:19,973
Yes, uh, thank you very much
for your help.

354
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,399
It's been a long time
since I let myself go like that.

355
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,869
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

356
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:54,108
You asked me
if I lost someone.

357
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,577
I did.

358
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:58,546
My husband.

359
00:17:58,548 --> 00:18:01,449
He died in Afghanistan
eight months ago.

360
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:05,619
That must have been,
um...

361
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:07,288
I...

362
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,489
I can't imagine.

363
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:10,858
Yeah.

364
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:16,031
We were together forever.

365
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:20,303
Or at least it seemed
that way.

366
00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:23,039
Then one day,
Don just enlists.

367
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,775
Didn't ask me,
just said something

368
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:29,446
about wanting to do
the right thing.

369
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:35,453
Next thing I know, he's
off overseas and I'm all alone.

370
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:39,524
I got a couple letters,
some phone calls,

371
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:42,694
and then a knock
at the door.

372
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:45,163
Just like that.

373
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,666
And everywhere I looked,

374
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,870
all I could see
was judgment and pity

375
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:55,274
and just this constant reminder
of Don everywhere.

376
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:58,677
So I moved here...

377
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,183
...and became even more of
a hot mess than I already was.

378
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,488
And you hit a dog.

379
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,513
Easy there, flyweight.

380
00:19:33,515 --> 00:19:35,082
Last time
you drank a beer,

381
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:37,284
I had to pick you up
off the floor.

382
00:19:40,356 --> 00:19:41,956
You're such an idjit.

383
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,430
Idjit's supposed to be used
angrily.

384
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,166
Okay? Not happy.

385
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:53,801
If you're gonna butcher it,
don't say it at all.

386
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:57,772
Whoa, then. Okay.

387
00:19:57,774 --> 00:20:00,441
N-none of my business,

388
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:03,444
but... this have anything to do
with you and... Sam?

389
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,446
No, you had it right.
It's none of your business.

390
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:07,081
Okay.

391
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,149
It just seems that you guys

392
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:10,218
are a little tense
around each other.

393
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,587
We're fine.

394
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:13,955
Can we get back to work?

395
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:14,890
Yeah.

396
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:15,824
Okay.

397
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:16,758
All right.

398
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,960
Just, uh...
just letting you know

399
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:21,496
that I'm here for you,
for anything.

400
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,934
I know sometimes Bobby,
he would...

401
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:27,535
You're not Bobby!

402
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:29,003
Okay?

403
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:32,873
You're never gonna be Bobby,
so stop!

404
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:44,185
Bobby belonged to all of us,
Dean... not just you and Sam.

405
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,422
Now, I'm just taking
what he showed me

406
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:50,291
and trying do something
with it.

407
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:52,293
That's all!

408
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:58,200
Why don't you see
if you can find something

409
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:00,101
in that bourbon-drenched book
of his

410
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:02,571
so we can get the hell
out of Dixie, all right?

411
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:04,673
Yeah. I'm on it.

412
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:13,881
Hey.

413
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:16,751
"Sussex" is not a who,
it's a what.

414
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:18,586
It's a business that went
belly-up about a year ago.

415
00:21:18,588 --> 00:21:19,921
Look at this.

416
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:22,857
So, the guy
that Scott brained?

417
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:26,994
His old business partner...
ran the company into the ground.

418
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:28,729
So,
Scott had a beef with Jeff.

419
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:31,432
Looks like.

420
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:36,404
Hey,
you're on speaker.

421
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:38,406
Sara Alcott's clean,
if you look past the fact

422
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:40,108
that she and Chester
knocked boots on prom night

423
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,577
back in the day.

424
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:43,545
Okay, so...

425
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:45,380
Mary has
a grudge against Sara,

426
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:47,983
and Scott has a grudge
against Jeff.

427
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:49,618
Besides the fact this is
making my head hurt,

428
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,987
how does this add up
to a ghost?

429
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:53,055
Guys!

430
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:54,723
Bobby has it right here.

431
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:56,892
Green goo equals a spectre.

432
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:58,594
Which equals ghost,
right?

433
00:21:58,596 --> 00:21:59,628
Mm, yeah, kind of.

434
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,530
A spectre is
an avenging ghost.

435
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:03,299
It, uh...
it possesses you

436
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:05,234
and finds out whatever betrayals
you're feeling

437
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:07,003
and forces you
to act on them.

438
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:09,171
Bobby say anything in there
about how we hunt these things?

439
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:12,008
Uh, the last spectre
he encountered

440
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,678
rose shortly after someone
desecrated a nearby grave.

441
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,084
Which...

442
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:26,755
Uh, there was a grave desecrated
locally three days ago.

443
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:28,223
It says here...

444
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:30,926
Oh.

445
00:22:30,928 --> 00:22:32,461
This could get awkward.

446
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:34,696
What?

447
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:39,635
The unknown soldier?

448
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:41,170
You're kidding me,
right?

449
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:42,371
Mary Lew steamrolled
her husband

450
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:43,772
the day after this place
was vandalized.

451
00:22:43,774 --> 00:22:45,073
Do the math.

452
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:47,309
But I thought the unknown
soldier was buried in Arlington.

453
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:49,878
Yep, but this is the Confederate
tomb of the unknown soldier.

454
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,613
See, the idea was,

455
00:22:51,615 --> 00:22:54,283
they took a faceless, nameless
soldier they couldn't identify,

456
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:55,317
and they buried him here

457
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,019
to commemorate
all the soldiers who died.

458
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:58,454
Did you learn that
in college?

459
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:00,422
Nope...
Civil War re-enactments.

460
00:23:00,424 --> 00:23:01,724
Once a year, every year.

461
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:05,427
Don't hate.

462
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:08,430
Okay, uh,
what about the guard?

463
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:10,599
Uh, he's ceremonial.
Gone by dusk.

464
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:12,834
- So, then we do this tonight?
- Yeah.

465
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:15,304
Burn a Confederate soldier's bones
in a town full of rednecks?

466
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:17,572
Sure.

467
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:41,862
Place doesn't look disturbed
to me.

468
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:43,430
What's
the police report say?

469
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:45,865
Uh, they think it was
just some kids messing around.

470
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:48,300
They, uh... they found
some beer cans, some graffiti.

471
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,169
Oh, and the casket was open
when they got here,

472
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:51,670
but they closed that
back up.

473
00:23:51,672 --> 00:23:54,406
Yeah, but not before Casper had
a chance to make a run for it.

474
00:23:54,408 --> 00:23:57,009
So, what? If they never touched this,
none of this would be happening?

475
00:23:57,011 --> 00:23:59,311
Yeah,
according to Bobby.

476
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:04,884
All right, well,
let's get this party started.

477
00:24:04,886 --> 00:24:08,221
Sammy, you want to give me
a hand?

478
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:12,959
And... go.

479
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:24,671
Whoa.
Check out this hardware.

480
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,472
Do you guys know
how much this is worth?

481
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:29,376
Yeah, but why open it up if
you're not gonna take anything?

482
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:31,044
I don't know.

483
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:34,314
Maybe the cops showed up
and they had to split fast.

484
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:37,150
You sure this will work,
even on a spectre?

485
00:24:37,152 --> 00:24:38,318
It's a ghost, isn't it?

486
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,122
You burn its bones,
the ghost disappears.

487
00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:48,195
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

488
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:50,798
Uh, I kind of feel like we
should say something, all right?

489
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,668
Don't you?
Just... a little...

490
00:24:57,473 --> 00:24:59,641
Sure.

491
00:24:59,643 --> 00:25:01,377
We won.

492
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:12,387
Write that up for me,
would you, Doug?

493
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,063
Help! Please!

494
00:25:25,301 --> 00:25:26,668
Hey. You okay?

495
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:32,006
Need my... asthma... inhaler.

496
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:34,476
From evidence. Please.

497
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,502
Why don't you write
your own reports, Sheriff?!

498
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:21,460
10 bones says Deputy Doug had
an Axe to grind with his boss.

499
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:23,095
How can you be
so sure?

500
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:25,965
Ah, what the hell?

501
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:27,734
Maybe we torched
the wrong redneck.

502
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:29,136
Or maybe not.

503
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:31,205
<i>Maybe an object was removed
from the grave,</i>

504
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:33,306
something the spectre's
attaching itself to.

505
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:34,674
Like Bobby's flask?

506
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,243
Um,
I don't know, guys.

507
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:38,545
You saw what I saw.
Those kids didn't take anything.

508
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:40,047
Or they did.

509
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:41,715
And this spectre hitched a ride
with it.

510
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:43,584
And whoever has the object
gets possessed.

511
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:46,820
Okay. So, who's got the object,
and, more importantly,

512
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:48,822
who do they got
a grudge against?

513
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:51,825
All right.
We need you to focus, Deputy.

514
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:54,495
Other lives depend on it.

515
00:26:54,497 --> 00:26:57,164
Tell me what happened
after you shot the sheriff.

516
00:26:57,166 --> 00:27:00,267
I was on the ground.

517
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:04,572
I think Karl tackled me,
and I asked him what happened.

518
00:27:04,574 --> 00:27:06,207
And?

519
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,910
He didn't answer me.

520
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:11,412
He just took my gun
and walked away.

521
00:27:11,414 --> 00:27:13,515
Did he say
where he was going?

522
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:17,719
I guess...
I must have hurt him, too.

523
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,788
He said he was going
to the hospital.

524
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:24,759
You two find out what you can
about the unknown soldier.

525
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:27,128
I got the hospital.

526
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:43,378
Hey, uh, Sam.

527
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,879
If you ever need to talk,

528
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:47,282
I just want to let you know
that I'm here.

529
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:50,118
About anything...
you know, life, uh, Dean, you.

530
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,486
I'm okay. Thanks.

531
00:27:51,488 --> 00:27:53,922
I mean, it just seems
like you and Dean are talking

532
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,590
but nobody's listening
to each other.

533
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,658
I had this cousin once...
well, he's gone now...

534
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,926
but his name was Frank.

535
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,729
Frank and I
used to build...

536
00:28:06,734 --> 00:28:08,168
Hey.

537
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,202
Hey.

538
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:10,937
Uh, just lock up
when you leave.

539
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,172
I'm late.

540
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:13,940
Wait, what?

541
00:28:17,243 --> 00:28:18,644
I just think it's better

542
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:20,646
if neither of us get
the wrong idea here.

543
00:28:22,282 --> 00:28:23,482
O-okay.

544
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,484
And I know I said
a lot of things last night,

545
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:27,386
and I know I can't ask you
to forget them.

546
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:30,355
But just... Do.

547
00:28:30,357 --> 00:28:32,358
Why?

548
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,159
Because I don't need
your pity.

549
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:36,628
I don't need you looking at me
the way they all...

550
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,696
like that.

551
00:28:37,698 --> 00:28:43,369
Wait, um
you think this is pity?

552
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:45,938
Amelia, I'm glad you told me
about Don.

553
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,373
It helps me understand.

554
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,842
How messed up I am?
You think I don't know that?

555
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:51,610
You don't have to feel sorry
for me, Sam.

556
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:52,878
I didn't mean it
like that.

557
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,114
Yeah, well, like I said,
I'm late. So...

558
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:10,296
Hey, you comin'?

559
00:29:22,242 --> 00:29:24,309
You do know there is
a good reason

560
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,645
<i>he's called the Unknown soldier,
right?</i>

561
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:27,846
Right.

562
00:29:27,848 --> 00:29:29,781
Uh, we were just hoping
maybe a theory or two

563
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:31,549
had been a floated around
over the years...

564
00:29:31,551 --> 00:29:33,251
something local, maybe?

565
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:37,122
There is one.

566
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:41,693
Hey, ump.

567
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:44,296
You remember me?
I stole second!

568
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:46,365
Karl?
What the hell are you doing?

569
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,500
Why are you doing...

570
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:49,869
Why am I gonna make mustard
from your brain stem?!

571
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,803
I don't know.

572
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:53,773
Why did you call me out,
ump?

573
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:55,075
I'm sorry.

574
00:29:55,077 --> 00:29:57,010
Please.

575
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:58,745
Looks like
you're shooting blanks.

576
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:03,383
Hey, that tickled.

577
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,557
Corporal Collins
of the Union

578
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,293
shot and killed
his brother, Vance,

579
00:30:13,295 --> 00:30:15,528
who fought
for the Confederacy.

580
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,496
Local boys.

581
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:18,631
Wait,
so two brothers fought

582
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:20,700
on opposite sides
of the Civil War?

583
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:24,037
Legend has it that Vance
swore vengeance on his brother

584
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,371
with his dying breath.

585
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:27,807
Years later...
consumed by guilt, no doubt...

586
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,843
the corporal dug
his brother up

587
00:30:29,845 --> 00:30:31,811
where he'd buried him
on the battlefield

588
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:33,113
and brought him home.

589
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:36,216
Are you suggesting this Vance
guy is the unknown soldier?

590
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:38,618
That's one theory,
anyway.

591
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,752
What's that?

592
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:42,589
Karl, listen,

593
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,424
I know the spectre's turning
the temperature up in there.

594
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,893
So just tell me
what the object is,

595
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:48,395
and we'll send this joker
home.

596
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:49,496
I don't think so.

597
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:53,900
There's unfinished business,
thanks to you.

598
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:58,505
Oh,
the spectre likes you.

599
00:30:58,507 --> 00:30:59,607
Oh, yeah?

600
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:01,075
Why don't you tell him
to come on out here?

601
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:03,177
We'll make promise bracelets.

602
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:09,316
Most of the soldiers
were poor farmers,

603
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:12,987
so the families would give them
a penny on a string.

604
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:15,857
It was for good luck,
and in case they ever got lost,

605
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:17,792
they always had a penny
for food or drink.

606
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:21,929
A penny.

607
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:27,835
Here. Have a taste.

608
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:32,907
<i>It's me. Do what you gotta.</i>

609
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:34,342
Dean, hey.

610
00:31:34,344 --> 00:31:36,177
There was a string on the floor
of the tomb.

611
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:38,079
It used to hold an old penny.

612
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:39,214
That's the object.

613
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:40,415
We're coming right now.

614
00:31:43,353 --> 00:31:45,253
Dean?
What the hell, man?

615
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:48,489
We went to the hospital.
You're not answering your phone.

616
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:57,198
You should have looked for me
when I was in Purgatory.

617
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:33,936
Come on, Dean.

618
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:35,447
I know it's not you in there
pulling the strings.

619
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:37,148
Shut up!

620
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,449
Don't!

621
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:44,388
You never even wanted
this life.

622
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,292
Always blamed me
for pulling you back into it.

623
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:48,993
- That's not true.
- Really?

624
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:50,461
'Cause everything
you've ever done

625
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:53,665
since you climbed into my ride
has been to deceive me.

626
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,867
What do you want me
to say?

627
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,702
That I've made mistakes?

628
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:00,171
I've made mistakes,
Dean.

629
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:01,773
That's not Dean, Sam.

630
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:03,274
Shut up!

631
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,244
Mistakes?

632
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:11,716
Well, let's go through
some of Sammy's greatest hits.

633
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,785
Drinking demon blood,
check.

634
00:34:13,787 --> 00:34:16,421
Being in cahoots with Ruby.

635
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:20,328
Not telling me
that you lost your soul.

636
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,599
Or how about running around
with Samuel for a whole year,

637
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:25,333
letting me think
that you were dead

638
00:34:25,335 --> 00:34:27,168
while you're doing
all kinds of crazy.

639
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,404
Those aren't mistakes,
Sam.

640
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:31,139
Those are choices!

641
00:34:31,141 --> 00:34:34,510
All right.
You said it.

642
00:34:34,512 --> 00:34:36,512
We've both played
a little fast and loose.

643
00:34:36,514 --> 00:34:40,916
Yeah, I might have lied,
but I never once betrayed you.

644
00:34:42,151 --> 00:34:45,553
I never once left you
to die.

645
00:34:45,555 --> 00:34:48,790
And for what, a girl?

646
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:51,392
You left me to die
for a girl?!

647
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:06,942
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

648
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:08,010
Garth, don't.

649
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:10,712
No, he won't kill me.

650
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:13,482
His beef isn't with me.

651
00:35:13,484 --> 00:35:15,685
You're not gonna shoot me,
are you, Dean?

652
00:35:15,687 --> 00:35:17,019
Move.

653
00:35:17,021 --> 00:35:18,521
Come on, Dean.

654
00:35:18,523 --> 00:35:20,890
You do not want to kill
your brother.

655
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:23,526
You... you've been protecting
him your whole life.

656
00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:24,661
Don't stop now.

657
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,963
He left me to rot
in Purgatory!

658
00:35:26,965 --> 00:35:28,864
All right. All right.
Maybe he did. I don't know.

659
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:31,166
I wasn't there.
But I'm sure he had his reasons.

660
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:33,836
Just like you had your reasons
for Benny.

661
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:35,337
Who?

662
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:37,339
Benny has been more of a brother
to me this past year

663
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:39,107
<i>than you've ever been!</i>

664
00:35:40,476 --> 00:35:41,643
That's right.

665
00:35:41,645 --> 00:35:43,110
Cass let me down.

666
00:35:43,112 --> 00:35:44,578
You let me down.

667
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,881
The only person that
hasn't let me down is Benny.

668
00:35:48,484 --> 00:35:49,550
I know you're angry.

669
00:35:49,552 --> 00:35:51,720
But, man,
you got to fight this thing.

670
00:35:51,722 --> 00:35:53,221
Do not do this!

671
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:54,890
Just let it go.

672
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,828
Come on, Dean.

673
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:02,931
Goodbye, Sam.

674
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,007
Ow! God!

675
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:19,114
Garth, don't!

676
00:36:21,452 --> 00:36:22,551
It's cool.

677
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:26,389
It's all good.
I'm cool.

678
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:44,212
It took me forever to melt
that penny, but it's finally gone.

679
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:46,599
How come that penny didn't
jack you like everyone else?

680
00:36:47,136 --> 00:36:48,202
I mean, I can understand

681
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:50,305
why it didn't affect
the kid who took it.

682
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:51,639
He's young and innocent.

683
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:53,654
But, uh, everyone
at some point in their life

684
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:55,454
feels like
they've been screwed.

685
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:56,655
Not me, man.

686
00:36:56,657 --> 00:36:58,824
I let all that stuff go
with the help of my yogi,

687
00:36:58,826 --> 00:36:59,858
my Sega Genesis.

688
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,227
And you should, too.

689
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:04,596
You can't change the past,
amigo.

690
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:09,034
Now, there's something
I want to say to you.

691
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,836
Stop being a idjit!

692
00:37:12,572 --> 00:37:15,741
With Bobby dead, you and Sam
are all each other has.

693
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:18,511
And that's not so bad, man.

694
00:37:20,147 --> 00:37:23,183
Now, you know
what's coming next, right?

695
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:24,484
Come on.

696
00:37:24,486 --> 00:37:25,452
Oh...

697
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:26,619
Come on.

698
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:29,756
Yeah, okay.

699
00:37:38,031 --> 00:37:39,766
Hey, uh...

700
00:37:48,676 --> 00:37:50,778
Keep on truckin', Garth.

701
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,848
Thanks.

702
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,183
Oh, got to go.

703
00:37:57,053 --> 00:38:00,488
Yo, Lamar.
What do we got?

704
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,689
Wendigo?

705
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:03,992
You got a flare gun?

706
00:38:03,994 --> 00:38:06,261
No?

707
00:38:06,263 --> 00:38:07,696
What about
a flame thrower?

708
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:12,268
Then you'd better get
some sneakers, buddy,

709
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,037
'cause you're
gonna have to run.

710
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,838
All right.

711
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:24,782
Balls!

712
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:53,542
Sam, I can't.

713
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:55,911
I don't pity you.
Okay?

714
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:58,113
I don't.

715
00:38:59,883 --> 00:39:02,951
You and I...
we're a lot of things,

716
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:05,420
but we're not to be pitied.

717
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,793
Look, I lost my brother, Dean,
a few months ago.

718
00:39:11,795 --> 00:39:14,762
It felt like
my world imploded

719
00:39:14,764 --> 00:39:18,633
and came raining down on me,
and...

720
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:20,101
I ran.

721
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:21,535
Just like you.

722
00:39:23,438 --> 00:39:25,405
Is that supposed to be
a pep talk?

723
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:29,008
Yeah, uh, sort of.

724
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,076
Because...

725
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:34,614
<i>See, now I pity you.</i>

726
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:39,587
Oh, look, I mean,
that wasn't really my point.

727
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:43,391
Yeah, well, bell's rung
on that one, so...

728
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:48,862
So, uh...

729
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:50,498
So what now?

730
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,799
I don't know.

731
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:54,001
You want to talk about it?

732
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:57,472
Last night?

733
00:39:57,474 --> 00:39:59,373
<i>No. Dean, you pervert.</i>

734
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:05,579
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like that.

735
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:10,017
Do you want to
talk about Don?

736
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:16,791
Hey,
I'd like that, too.

737
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:23,397
Sammy!

738
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,444
For the record, the girl...
her name's Amelia.

739
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:36,678
Amelia Richardson.

740
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,982
She and I had a place together
in Kermit, Texas.

741
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:41,885
Look, man, I don't even remember
what I said, but, uh...

742
00:40:41,887 --> 00:40:42,919
But what?

743
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:44,554
But you didn't mean it?
Oh, please.

744
00:40:44,556 --> 00:40:46,056
You and I both know

745
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:47,437
you didn't need that penny
to say those things.

746
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:48,125
Come on, Sam.

747
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:49,659
Own up to your crap,
Dean.

748
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:52,195
I told you from the jump
where I was coming from,

749
00:40:52,197 --> 00:40:53,763
why I didn't look
for you.

750
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:55,098
But you?

751
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,366
You had secrets.

752
00:40:56,368 --> 00:40:57,433
You had Benny.

753
00:40:57,435 --> 00:40:59,569
And you got
on your high and mighty,

754
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:02,038
and you've been kicking me
ever since you got back.

755
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,139
But that's over.

756
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:07,343
So move on, or I will.

757
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:10,480
Okay.

758
00:41:10,482 --> 00:41:12,048
I hear you.

759
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,184
Good.

760
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:19,522
You know what?
Hear this, too.

761
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:21,357
I just might be
that hunter

762
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,960
that runs into Benny one day
and ices him.

763
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:29,532
I guess we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it, won't we?

764
00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:32,769
Yeah.

765
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:35,171
Yeah.
You keep saying that.

766
