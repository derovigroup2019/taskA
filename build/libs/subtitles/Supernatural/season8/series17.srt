1
00:00:01,644 --> 00:00:02,309
She's uh...

2
00:00:02,499 --> 00:00:03,090
Meg.

3
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:04,292
She's a demon, Sam.

4
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:07,127
Remember me?
I sure remember you, Clarence.

5
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:08,795
I learned that
from the pizza man.

6
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:11,998
She's running. Which means
you're running from Crowley.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,017
My name is Naomi.
We rescued you.

8
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,752
They're controlling us,
Castiel!

9
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:17,471
Kill him!
This is a direct order!

10
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:19,222
What did I just do?

11
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:21,448
You tell the winchesters
that Samandriel had been...

12
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:22,293
Compromised.

13
00:00:22,294 --> 00:00:23,727
You acted in...
Self-defense.

14
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:25,028
Cass, you okay?

15
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,232
There's another tablet?
So, another Word of God.

16
00:00:30,602 --> 00:00:32,702
The Angel Tablet,
Castiel.

17
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:33,937
Crowley knows.

18
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:35,489
God built a series of tests.

19
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,324
When you've done all three,
you can slam the Gates of Hell.

20
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:38,792
Sam,
I didn't pass a test.

21
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:41,161
But I did. And I'm doing
the rest of them.

22
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:43,663
Cass,
you got your ears on?

23
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:47,000
You keep a lookout
for my little brother, okay?

24
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:18,031
No, Cass. No!

25
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:22,502
No, Cass, don't.
Please.

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,065
No hesitation.

27
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:54,985
Quick. Brutal.

28
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:56,519
Everything's
back in order.

29
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:59,155
Finally.

30
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:01,658
You're ready.

31
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:15,636
<font color=#00FF00>? Supernatural 8x17 ?</font>

33
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:27,934
What the hell is this?

34
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:32,072
Spear of Destiny?

35
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:33,940
What is this --
God's toothpick?

36
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:39,112
You know, would it have killed
these asshats

37
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:40,113
to label these boxes

38
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:42,782
in something
other than hieroglyphics?

39
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:44,084
It's ridiculous.

40
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:52,208
Hey.
You listening to me?

41
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:54,844
Yeah.

42
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:56,963
It's, uh...
Fascinating stuff.

43
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:58,348
You should probably, uh,

44
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,849
write it all down
in your journal

45
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:01,351
for the archives,
you know?

46
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,020
Yeah, thanks.
You're a lot of help.

47
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:13,396
Hey, Doc Holliday,
you all right over there?

48
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:17,784
Uh, yeah.

49
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:19,569
Um...
I'm fine.

50
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:22,455
Just, uh, wrong pipe.

51
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:33,800
Well, hello.

52
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:38,922
These Men of Letters
weren't so boring after all.

53
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,159
Konnichiwa.

54
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:45,428
Hey, check this out.

55
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,646
What is wrong with you?

56
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:47,797
What's wrong with me?

57
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,298
You kidding me?
This is a first edition, dude.

58
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,151
You know what this would
go for on eBay?

59
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:53,319
No. Why? Do <i>you?</i>

60
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:55,071
No.

61
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:56,740
Maybe.

62
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:58,441
Shut up.

63
00:03:58,443 --> 00:03:59,642
You find anything?

64
00:03:59,644 --> 00:04:00,910
I did, yeah --

65
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:03,913
uh, dead bodies showing up
all over the Midwest last week.

66
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:07,333
Benton, Indiana;
Downers Grove, Illinois;

67
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:08,651
uh, Novi, Michigan;

68
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:10,787
and then again last night
in Lincoln Springs, Missouri.

69
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,122
And how is this us?

70
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:14,007
Because each of the victims
had severe burns

71
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,658
around their eyes, hands,
and feet,

72
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,844
puncture wounds through
the backs of their hands,

73
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:20,847
eyes and internal organs
liquefied.

74
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,766
That sounds like us.

75
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:23,767
Yeah.

76
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,668
Also, no link
between any of the victims.

77
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,320
Uh, one was
a real-estate agent.

78
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:29,055
Another was
a local historian.

79
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:30,523
Woman killed last night
was a teacher.

80
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,726
So, chupacabra.

81
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,110
What do we got?
Power tools gone rogue?

82
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:35,311
Wait -- are we talking

83
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:37,847
a-a "Maximum Overdrive"
situation here?

84
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,515
I don't know.

85
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:40,867
Worth a shot, though.

86
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:42,786
I'll grab my gear. We should
probably leave in five.

87
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:44,154
Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:46,856
'Less, of course, you need some
more time with Miss October.

89
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,124
What?

90
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:51,010
Oh.

91
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:52,746
Yeah.
Yeah, make it 10.

92
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:12,649
We just have a few
routine follow-up questions

93
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:13,983
about your wife, sir.

94
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:16,653
Did she have
any enemies?

95
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,154
Ann?

96
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:20,723
Honestly, I can't think of
a soul who'd want to hurt her,

97
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:22,509
even after
everything that happened.

98
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:24,611
Everything
that happened?

99
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:28,081
About a week ago,
something changed in Ann.

100
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,417
She was out of sorts,
not herself at all.

101
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,153
Out of sorts how?

102
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:36,022
It'd be better
if I show you.

103
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:39,242
She stopped sleeping.

104
00:05:39,244 --> 00:05:40,627
She stopped eating.

105
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:42,712
She went out
in the middle of the night,

106
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:44,914
going God knows where.

107
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,967
I tried to talk to her,
but, uh...

108
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:49,936
She would just mutter
to herself.

109
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:51,855
About what?

110
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:56,142
Something...
about an orchard?

111
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:59,946
Finally, I just followed her
one night,

112
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:01,447
and she went
to the playground.

113
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:03,283
Over here --
the elementary school.

114
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:06,903
And she started digging.

115
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:09,372
She would leave with
these little bags full of dirt.

116
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:11,407
Hung them here.

117
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:16,212
All these bags represent holes
that she dug in the ground.

118
00:06:16,214 --> 00:06:19,415
Were these holes, uh --
I don't know -- 6 feet deep?

119
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:20,416
No.

120
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:21,968
She dug for hours.

121
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,803
She never broke a sweat.

122
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:26,005
Straight down
10, maybe 15 feet.

123
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:29,392
Did you notice
anything else?

124
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:35,798
I didn't say anything
to the cops

125
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,817
'cause I didn't want them
to think I was crazy.

126
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,403
After Ann came home,

127
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:42,355
I came down here
to confront her,

128
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:43,656
and she was on the phone.

129
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:45,024
Any idea
who she was talking to?

130
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:46,276
No.

131
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:47,660
But I know what I saw.

132
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,362
And it wasn't my Annie.

133
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:55,151
After I called her out,
her eyes...

134
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:56,419
they turned black.

135
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:01,991
Now, I-I know
I must have imagined it.

136
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:04,427
I know I did.
But I-I left.

137
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:06,462
I went to the bar,
probably had too much to drink,

138
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:09,048
and by the time
I came back...

139
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:14,304
...my Annie was, uh...

140
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:19,175
I should have stayed.

141
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:23,012
I should have
protected her.

142
00:07:23,014 --> 00:07:26,783
I'm moving into
my sister's place today.

143
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:29,569
I can't be here
anymore.

144
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,204
Sure.

145
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:35,358
Well, um, thank you very much
for your time.

146
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,911
We're both very sorry
for your loss.

147
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:41,080
So, somebody's killing demons.
Well, that is awesome.

148
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:43,132
I feel like we should send
a card or flowers.

149
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:45,251
What kind of flower says
"thanks for killing demons"?

150
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,921
Yeah, but <i>who's</i> killing demons?
And why?

151
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:50,539
And, by the way, since when does
a demon possess someone,

152
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,925
then go
all "Beautiful Mind"

153
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:53,643
and -- and start digging
in the dirt?

154
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:55,211
Does any of this
seem right to you?

155
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,897
I like the part about killing demons.
That sounds right.

156
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:05,571
Sure.

157
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:06,906
Of course.

158
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:09,158
Well, thank you very much
for all your help.

159
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,827
I really appreciate
the time.

160
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,728
All right. Bye.

161
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,366
So, real-estate guy's wife said
he was acting weird.

162
00:08:16,368 --> 00:08:18,284
Uh, historian's hubby
said the same --

163
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:21,170
just got all obsessive
and then weird.

164
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:23,072
No one saw
any black eyes,

165
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:24,907
but still, where there's smoke,
you know...

166
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:26,542
I wonder what they're
all looking for.

167
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:28,911
Well, Wendy Rice here
was the last person

168
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:31,848
to speak with Ann,
so let's see if she can tell us.

169
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:38,855
Special Agent lynne.

170
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:40,356
This is my partner,
Special Agent Tandy.

171
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:42,692
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about Ann Morton.

172
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:44,610
Oh.

173
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:46,562
Uh, uh, uh, of course.
Please come in.

174
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:51,868
I had never met her

175
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,786
before she called
the other night.

176
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:56,739
Now,
why was she calling you?

177
00:08:56,741 --> 00:09:00,460
She was looking to find
an original map of the city.

178
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:03,312
Did she say
what for?

179
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:06,282
Well, she -- she didn't,
but she did mention

180
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:08,568
an -- an old orchard
that had gone missing.

181
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,086
Missing?

182
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:12,755
This -- this town was wiped
from the earth

183
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,790
by one of the river's
100-year floods.

184
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,893
It was --
it was rebuilt.

185
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:20,063
But all the original records
were -- were lost.

186
00:09:21,132 --> 00:09:23,266
I'm --
I'm a PhD candidate.

187
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:26,903
And this --
this is my research.

188
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:28,104
I, uh...

189
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,775
My dissertation is -- is
on the history of this town

190
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:35,411
and, uh, its connection
to the Underground Railroad

191
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:37,780
and -- and -- and whatnot.

192
00:09:37,782 --> 00:09:41,817
I've been working
to re-create a map for years

193
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:43,202
as part of my research,

194
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:46,589
and this -- this is
the old Jakubiak orchard there.

195
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:49,926
I found out yesterday it's
where Downey meets Bond Street.

196
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:51,978
Now, did Ann say
why she was looking

197
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,880
for the site
of an old orchard?

198
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:55,681
No.

199
00:09:55,683 --> 00:09:59,552
We -- we set a time to meet,
and she never showed.

200
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:03,306
Then I read about her
in the paper.

201
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:06,175
It's just tragic.

202
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:09,128
Ann's assistant called
this morning, though,

203
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,514
asking if I still
had the map.

204
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:12,782
Assistant?

205
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,017
Oh.

206
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,402
That's probably him.

207
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:18,237
Maybe he can help.

208
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:26,712
Oh. Are -- are you --

209
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,261
Put this on your shoulder.

210
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:25,347
I'm fine.

211
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:27,299
The other demon escaped.

212
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:29,068
I bound the one I caught
in a devil's trap.

213
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,469
I'm gonna
interrogate it now.

214
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:31,520
Wait a second. Cass.

215
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:33,489
How about you answer
some questions first?

216
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:36,008
Like, where the hell
have you been?

217
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:41,480
You heard me,
didn't you?

218
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:43,365
You prayed to him?

219
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:46,485
Yes, I heard you.

220
00:11:46,487 --> 00:11:49,288
But that's
not why I'm here.

221
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:52,007
I've been hunting demons.

222
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:56,128
So this is <i>you.</i>

223
00:11:57,464 --> 00:11:58,263
Why?

224
00:11:58,265 --> 00:12:00,049
What should I tell them?

225
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:03,102
The truth.

226
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:04,770
Most of it, anyway.

227
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:09,391
Maybe they can
get us closer.

228
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:11,644
I've been searching for the
other half of the Demon Tablet.

229
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:13,062
Without us?

230
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,998
I've been trying to help,
Dean.

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,350
And in my search,
I uncovered

232
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:21,570
that Crowley has sent out demons
to find Lucifer's crypts.

233
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:23,188
Lucifer had crypts?

234
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,140
Dozens of them,
apparently.

235
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:26,358
But why
the storage wars?

236
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,127
I mean, what the hell
are they all looking for?

237
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:30,713
It would be more helpful
if they knew everything.

238
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:32,381
They cannot be trusted.
But --

239
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,466
Lie, Castiel.

240
00:12:35,702 --> 00:12:37,636
Tell them
what we discussed.

241
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:40,456
They're looking for a parchment
that would allow them

242
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,258
to decipher Crowley's half
of the Demon Tablet

243
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,259
without a Prophet.

244
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:46,178
A demonic decoder ring?

245
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,596
In Crowley's hands?

246
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:48,597
Awesome.

247
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:52,518
The crypts were, uh,
lost over time.

248
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,771
Only those closest to Lucifer
knew their whereabouts.

249
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:57,690
Then how did Crowley
find them?

250
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:59,391
His demons
have been possessing locals

251
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:01,577
who may have
some special knowledge.

252
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,563
That would explain
the crazy room at Ann's house.

253
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,050
But how did they know where to
start looking in the first place?

254
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:09,234
I don't know.

255
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:11,236
I'm hoping the strange-haired
demon in the kitchen

256
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:14,173
is more knowledgeable
than the others I interrogated.

257
00:13:17,744 --> 00:13:20,796
Well, he puts the "ass"
in "Cass," huh?

258
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:21,947
He's definitely off.

259
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:23,265
Off?

260
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:25,551
He hasn't been right since
he got back from Purgatory.

261
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:27,436
We still don't know
how he got out of there.

262
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:29,938
I don't know, Dean.

263
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,124
If he's so sketchy, then why
were you praying to him?

264
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:38,363
You know,
I can hear you both.

265
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:39,948
I <i>am</i> a celestial being.

266
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:48,590
Sam and Dean Winchester.

267
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:54,112
Oh, the thoughts she had
about you two.

268
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:55,664
Mostly you, Sam.

269
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,382
What can I say?

270
00:13:57,384 --> 00:14:00,952
She has a thing
for smutton chops.

271
00:14:00,954 --> 00:14:02,788
All right, you douchebag,
listen --

272
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,673
aah!

273
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:14,099
Who told you
about the crypts?

274
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:20,072
I thought angels were
supposed to be the <i>good</i> cops.

275
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:21,306
Aah!

276
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:22,941
Wait! Stop!

277
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:24,910
Stop!!

278
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:26,912
We have a hostage!

279
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:33,035
It's one of Crowley's pets.

280
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:36,371
She's at the Murray Hotel,
down by the interstate.

281
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:38,540
She knows the towns
where all the crypts are buried.

282
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,592
She saw them all
back in the day.

283
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:43,295
And she told you
about the parchment?

284
00:14:45,832 --> 00:14:47,399
What parchment?!

285
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:49,468
Hey. Hey!

286
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,804
Think he's the only bad cop
in this room?

287
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:53,138
Stop lying!

288
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,773
We know
what you're really looking for.

289
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:55,808
No.

290
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,676
I am telling you,
we're looking...

291
00:14:57,678 --> 00:14:58,477
Kill it!

292
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,778
...for -- aah!

293
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,729
Cass!

294
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:04,199
What the hell was that?!

295
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:05,567
It told us
what we needed.

296
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:06,702
No, she didn't!
You can't just --

297
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:08,353
I started this hunt
without you

298
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:10,122
because I didn't want anything
to slow me down.

299
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:11,790
We have to get
to the motel now.

300
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:13,208
Hold on a second --

301
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,409
Cass!
Cass? Cass?

302
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:15,360
Damn it. Go. Go. Go.

303
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:24,219
There. There.

304
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:39,718
Thanks for waiting.

305
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,820
The hostage is in there.

306
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:57,586
Aren't you a little short
for a Stormtrooper?

307
00:16:00,874 --> 00:16:04,593
So, I got to ask.
Um...

308
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:05,794
What's up with the hair?

309
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:07,546
What?

310
00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:09,882
Aww. Thanks for noticing,
Dean.

311
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:11,884
But this wasn't my idea.
It was Crowley's.

312
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:14,436
And it's just another reason
I want to stab him in the face.

313
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:16,438
Wait a second.

314
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,924
You've been telling Crowley the
location of Lucifer's crypts.

315
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:20,525
What can I say?

316
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:23,028
I needed a break
from the constant torture.

317
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,732
And I did visit them all
during my time with Yellow Eyes.

318
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:28,066
But don't worry.

319
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:31,169
I haven't exactly been giving
them the Glengarry leads.

320
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:33,872
You mean
you've been lying to them?

321
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:36,274
I just get them
in the ballpark.

322
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:38,560
Enough time's passed
and enough's changed

323
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:39,711
that they bought it.

324
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:41,880
Why lie?

325
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:45,550
Buy myself some time,
dummy.

326
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:47,236
Try to find a way
to get free.

327
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:50,339
Wait -- so...
A bunch of innocent people died

328
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:53,175
so you could...
buy yourself some time?

329
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:55,661
Hi. I'm Meg.
I'm a demon.

330
00:16:57,814 --> 00:17:00,799
So, what have
they found?

331
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:01,900
Bupkis.

332
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:03,135
Every crypt's been

333
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:05,604
one Al Capone's vault
after another.

334
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:08,006
And on top of that, someone
kept picking up the trail

335
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:09,041
and icing demons.

336
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:11,443
I'm guessing
that was <i>you,</i> Castiel.

337
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:14,696
But Crowley
just keeps sending more.

338
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:15,747
He's hell-bent on...

339
00:17:15,749 --> 00:17:20,085
She's gonna tell them
the truth.

340
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:21,570
Do I have to kill her?

341
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:26,758
She does know
the location of the crypts.

342
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,796
But working with a demon
is...unclean.

343
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,266
Well, we could use her --
as Crowley did.

344
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:37,269
Agreed.

345
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:41,974
...finding
that Angel Tablet.

346
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:46,111
Wait a second.

347
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,649
Did you just say
<i>"Angel</i> Tablet"?

348
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:53,719
You know, I get why
Crowley calls you "moose" now.

349
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:57,456
Yes -- "Angel Tablet."

350
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,292
Crowley found out
Lucifer had it,

351
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:02,911
figures it's stashed
in a crypt.

352
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:05,797
Well, this is news to me,
as well.

353
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,966
Demons I interrogated,

354
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,836
they must have been lying
about their true intentions.

355
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:12,537
Really?

356
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,007
'Cause I saw you
"Zero Dark Thirty" that demon.

357
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:17,059
You were
more than persuasive.

358
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,162
You're both missing
the point.

359
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:21,379
I lied to them,

360
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:23,648
which means they're digging
in the wrong place.

361
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,650
But not for long.
They'll be back here soon.

362
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,287
So,
who's up for fleeing?

363
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:32,657
She's right. We need to find
those crypts before <i>they</i> do.

364
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:35,193
Meg, you're the only one
who's been there.

365
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:37,362
We need your help.

366
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:45,504
Any of you dummies
got a map?

367
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,925
There. That's where
the crypt was.

368
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,293
What's there <i>now?</i>

369
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:54,129
Do I look like Google
to you?

370
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:57,749
None of these buildings
were here way back in the day.

371
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,251
Figure it out, genius.

372
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:02,754
Is there any booze
in this dump?

373
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:07,609
He lied to us.

374
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:10,062
Yeah, maybe.
I can kind of understand why.

375
00:19:10,064 --> 00:19:11,930
I mean, an Angel Tablet?

376
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:13,815
If the Demon Tablet
can shut the Gates of Hell,

377
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:15,400
what can
the Angel Tablet do?

378
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:21,940
These wounds
have festered.

379
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:25,077
You really do know how to make
a girl's nethers quiver,

380
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,161
don't you?

381
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:28,413
I <i>am</i> aware
of how to do that.

382
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:34,119
Although it doesn't
usually involve cleaning wounds.

383
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:36,955
Why are you so sweet on me,
Clarence?

384
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:40,125
I don't know.

385
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:43,395
And I still don't know
who Clarence is.

386
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:47,799
Would it kill you
to watch a movie, read a book?

387
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:49,634
A movie, no.

388
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:51,636
But a book
with the proper spells --

389
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:54,923
yeah, it could,
theoretically, kill me.

390
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:57,909
You know, you're much cuter
when you're shutting up.

391
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:05,984
So, which Cass
are you now?

392
00:20:05,986 --> 00:20:08,887
Original make and model
or crazy town?

393
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:12,841
I'm just me.

394
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:15,160
So, your noodle's
back in order?

395
00:20:16,963 --> 00:20:20,348
Yeah, my...noodle
remembers everything.

396
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,033
I think
it's a pretty good noodle.

397
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:23,385
Really?

398
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:25,220
You remember <i>everything?</i>

399
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:33,011
If you're referring
to the pizza man...

400
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:36,314
Yes, I remember
the pizza man.

401
00:20:37,884 --> 00:20:39,618
And it's a good memory.

402
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:44,739
Here goes.

403
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:45,707
All right.

404
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,125
According to this,

405
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:49,794
the crypt has to be
below an abandoned building.

406
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:51,830
Good times.

407
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:56,384
You really think we can trust,
uh, Meg-stiel?

408
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:57,853
No.

409
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:59,471
But what choice
do we have?

410
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:05,093
You ever miss
the Apocalypse?

411
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:08,413
No. Why would I miss
the end of times?

412
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:10,932
I miss the simplicity.

413
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:12,851
I was bad.
You were good.

414
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:14,236
Life was easier.

415
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:16,905
Now it's all so messy.

416
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:21,543
I'm kind of good,
which sucks.

417
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:23,828
And you're kind of bad --

418
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,465
which is actually
all manner of hot.

419
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,571
We survive this...

420
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:35,240
I'm gonna order
some pizza

421
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:36,975
and we're gonna
move some furniture around.

422
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:38,126
You understand?

423
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:40,212
No, I-I --

424
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:45,050
wait -- actually...

425
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:46,051
Yes, I --

426
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:49,104
All right.
Let's roll, campers.

427
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:04,736
Sir?

428
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:08,590
I, uh, searched the site
top to bottom.

429
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:10,125
It's empty.

430
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:13,411
No, there's no crypt there.

431
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:15,880
And, uh, that's not all.

432
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:18,449
It's just me now, sir.

433
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:20,001
I, um...

434
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:22,804
<i>We</i> may have lost Meg.

435
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,757
Sir?

436
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:29,010
Hello, sir?

437
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:31,462
Just to be clear...

438
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:37,402
...you can't find
a hole in the ground...

439
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:42,073
Your coworkers have met
with an untimely demise...

440
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:49,931
...and you've lost
my favorite chew toy.

441
00:22:53,336 --> 00:22:55,870
Brilliant.

442
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:58,540
What's that old expression?

443
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:01,593
"If you want
something done right..."

444
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:11,419
...blah, blah, blah.

445
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:21,479
So, this is it.

446
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:22,447
Basement?

447
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:24,065
All right, Cass and I
will head in

448
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:25,534
and get
our Indiana Jones on.

449
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:27,118
Sam, you stay outside
with Meg.

450
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,119
What?
We got this.

451
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:29,237
What are you
talking about, Dean?

452
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,989
I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

453
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:32,857
He won't be alone.
That's not what I mean.

454
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,659
Meg can hang here,
watch our backs.

455
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,328
Oh, what?
Now you trust Meg?

456
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,029
Hey,
I got you <i>this</i> far.

457
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:39,047
Shut up.
Shut up, Meg.

458
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:40,215
Dean --

459
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:42,250
Sam, I saw your bloody rag
in the trash can, okay?

460
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:47,839
That wasn't --
Stop.

461
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:50,675
Just stop.

462
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:52,427
Sam, we don't know
what's in there, okay?

463
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:54,930
And you almost let a demon
get the best of you back there.

464
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:56,047
I'm fine.
No, you're not fine.

465
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,899
You haven't been fine
since the first trial.

466
00:23:57,901 --> 00:23:59,434
That's why
I called Cass.

467
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:01,403
Trial?
Shut up, Meg. Shut up, Meg.

468
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:04,973
Dean, I'm telling you --
I'm okay.

469
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:06,908
No, you're not.

470
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,361
Sam...

471
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:11,646
You're damaged in ways
even <i>I</i> can't heal.

472
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:15,166
Dean's right.

473
00:24:15,168 --> 00:24:16,952
You should stay here
and protect Meg.

474
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,337
Since when
do I need protecting?

475
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:22,407
Since you were held captive
and tortured for over a year.

476
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:24,376
Touch?.

477
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:29,047
All right,
we'll be back.

478
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:47,932
Hey, what did you mean
back there about Sam?

479
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:50,452
It's difficult to say.

480
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:53,905
It's something
on the subatomic level

481
00:24:53,907 --> 00:24:55,407
and his
electromagnetic field --

482
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:57,125
Okay, bottom-line it for me,
Bill Nye.

483
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:58,943
Is it lethal?
I don't know.

484
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:00,378
Wait.

485
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:02,914
There's a draft.

486
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:06,568
There's something
behind there.

487
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:09,888
Stand back.

488
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:21,366
Wait -- so I took
how many bullets for you guys,

489
00:25:21,368 --> 00:25:24,102
and you didn't even
look for me?

490
00:25:25,805 --> 00:25:27,105
Like, once?

491
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,961
My hero.

492
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:38,984
What's with all the "trial"
and "being damaged" crap?

493
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:42,921
Look, no disrespect,
but you haven't exactly been

494
00:25:42,923 --> 00:25:46,491
the most, uh, trustworthy person
in our lives, Meg.

495
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:48,043
You're not gonna tell me?

496
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:50,595
Seriously?

497
00:25:50,597 --> 00:25:52,830
How am I not team Sam?

498
00:25:57,654 --> 00:25:58,720
Fine.

499
00:25:58,722 --> 00:26:02,173
Whatever it is,
you okay dying over it?

500
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,447
You don't want to say,
fine.

501
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:12,850
But remember, I spent time
in that walking corpse of yours.

502
00:26:12,852 --> 00:26:15,686
I know your sad, little thoughts
and feelings.

503
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:18,239
That's creepy.

504
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,826
Here's what I remember.

505
00:26:21,828 --> 00:26:25,230
Deep down, in parts you never
let see the light of day,

506
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:27,065
you want to live
a long, normal life

507
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:30,185
away from creepy old things
like me.

508
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,756
I do.

509
00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:38,876
You know,
I spent last year with...

510
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:40,595
someone, and, um...

511
00:26:42,064 --> 00:26:44,715
...now I know
that's actually possible.

512
00:26:44,717 --> 00:26:47,085
Wait -- that's how you spent
your last year?

513
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:48,436
With a chick?

514
00:26:48,438 --> 00:26:49,720
Lame.

515
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:52,073
You know,
how about we just wait quietly?

516
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,493
What was her name?

517
00:26:55,495 --> 00:26:57,529
You don't even trust me
with a name?

518
00:26:57,531 --> 00:26:59,864
Cut me,
do I not bleed, Sam?

519
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:05,420
So, some chick actually got you
off hunting, huh?

520
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:07,172
That's one rare creature.

521
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:09,207
Tell me --

522
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:11,626
how'd you meet
this unicorn?

523
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,394
I found it.

524
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:36,618
Tell the Winchester
the crypt is empty.

525
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,769
Then you can
come back --

526
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:39,270
It's warded
against angels.

527
00:27:39,272 --> 00:27:40,605
Well,
you can come back --

528
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:42,073
Crowley's demons
are still in town,

529
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:43,625
and we're
running out of time.

530
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:44,909
What should I do?

531
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:47,212
Handle it.

532
00:27:47,214 --> 00:27:50,081
Dean...

533
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,216
That's it.

534
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:56,638
How do you know?

535
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,457
It's the only thing in here
warded against angels.

536
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:38,162
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

537
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:45,803
Good.

538
00:28:45,805 --> 00:28:47,956
Hand it to me,
and I'll take it to heaven.

539
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:57,198
No, we will take it to Kevin
so he can translate.

540
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,350
Right. Of course.

541
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:01,769
I'll take it to him
right away.

542
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:03,454
No time to waste.

543
00:29:05,124 --> 00:29:06,457
Well, he's not that far.

544
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:09,860
I've been meaning to...
go check on him,

545
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:11,129
bring him some supplies.

546
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:13,381
If the demons get their hands
on the Angel Tablet,

547
00:29:13,383 --> 00:29:14,566
they'll kill us all.

548
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:17,802
They'll destroy heaven.

549
00:29:17,804 --> 00:29:19,721
I can reason with Dean.

550
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:20,872
He's a good man.

551
00:29:20,874 --> 00:29:22,340
Kill him.

552
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:25,143
I can resupply the Prophet,
Dean.

553
00:29:26,428 --> 00:29:27,929
You know, why don't, uh,

554
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:30,515
why don't Sam and I
take it over to him,

555
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:33,568
and you can get back
to your mission?

556
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,553
Finding the other half
of the Demon Tablet --

557
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:37,805
that <i>is</i> priority,
isn't it?

558
00:29:39,775 --> 00:29:41,843
I can't let you take that,
Dean.

559
00:29:43,162 --> 00:29:44,562
Can't or won't?

560
00:29:44,564 --> 00:29:46,897
Both.

561
00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:57,492
How did you get out
of Purgatory, Cass?

562
00:29:59,011 --> 00:30:00,511
There has to be
another way.

563
00:30:00,513 --> 00:30:03,080
You have done this
a thousand times, Castiel.

564
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:04,915
You're ready.

565
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:07,135
Kill him.

566
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:08,469
Then take the tablet

567
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:10,855
and bring it home,
where it belongs.

568
00:30:10,857 --> 00:30:12,890
Just tell me
how you got out of Purgatory.

569
00:30:12,892 --> 00:30:14,976
Be honest with me --

570
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:17,061
for the first time
since you've been back --

571
00:30:17,063 --> 00:30:19,197
and this is yours.

572
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:23,985
Wait -- h-hold on.

573
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:25,603
There's one part
I don't understand.

574
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:28,656
You hit a dog
and stopped. Why?

575
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:34,445
That whole story,
and <i>that's</i> your takeaway?

576
00:30:34,447 --> 00:30:35,630
Oh, I heard the rest.

577
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:37,498
You fell in love
with a unicorn.

578
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,417
It was beautiful, then sad,
then sadder.

579
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:43,120
I laughed, I cried,
I puked in my mouth a little.

580
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:47,342
And honestly,
I kind of get it.

581
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:50,728
Really?

582
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,601
We've got company.

583
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:01,806
Cass.

584
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:03,691
Cass, I don't know what the hell
is wrong with you,

585
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:05,243
but if you're in there
and you can hear me,

586
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:06,811
you don't
have to do this.

587
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:07,578
Cass!

588
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,615
This isn't right.

589
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:12,750
Do you realize
what that tablet can do for us?

590
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:13,618
I...

591
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,203
For heaven?

592
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:16,504
I won't hurt Dean.

593
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:18,289
Yes. You will.

594
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:19,707
You <i>are.</i>

595
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,342
Cass, fight this!
This is not you!

596
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,344
Fight it!

597
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:27,932
What have you done
to me?!

598
00:31:27,934 --> 00:31:29,467
Just relax, Castiel.

599
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:30,885
Let your vessel do

600
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:33,337
what you know deep down
is the right thing.

601
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:35,440
What have you done to me,
Naomi?

602
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:36,724
Who's Naomi?!

603
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:38,276
What have I done to you?!

604
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:41,679
Do you have any idea
what it's like out there?

605
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:45,450
There's blood <i>everywhere,</i>
and it's on your hands.

606
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:50,621
After everything you did --
to us, to heaven.

607
00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:53,658
I fixed you, Castiel.

608
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,543
<i>I</i> fixed you!

609
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:08,339
Cass!

610
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:37,168
I believe
they're playing my song.

611
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:44,175
You want it?

612
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,177
Take it!

613
00:32:47,296 --> 00:32:48,963
But you're gonna
have to kill me first.

614
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:51,933
Come on, you coward.

615
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:53,518
Do it.

616
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,469
Do it!

617
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:00,975
Please.

618
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:02,693
End this, Castiel.

619
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:09,367
Cass...
This isn't you.

620
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:11,035
This isn't you.

621
00:33:11,037 --> 00:33:13,988
Bring me the tablet!

622
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,491
Ohh!

623
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:18,075
Cass.

624
00:33:18,077 --> 00:33:19,076
Cass.

625
00:33:19,078 --> 00:33:21,879
I know you're in there.

626
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:25,299
I know you can hear me.

627
00:33:25,301 --> 00:33:26,634
Cass...

628
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:28,503
It's me.

629
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:32,173
We're family.

630
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:35,760
We need you.

631
00:33:36,962 --> 00:33:38,229
I need you.

632
00:33:38,231 --> 00:33:40,181
You have to choose,
Castiel --

633
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:42,733
us or them.

634
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,820
Cass.

635
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:11,045
Aah!

636
00:34:12,965 --> 00:34:14,599
Aah!

637
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:16,350
Castiel!

638
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:19,253
Castiel!!

639
00:34:30,483 --> 00:34:32,501
Cass?

640
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,702
No.

641
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,921
Cass. Cass!

642
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:48,267
I'm so sorry, Dean.

643
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:50,836
What the hell
just happened?

644
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,889
Love what you've done
with the place.

645
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:57,960
You really think all that
was gonna keep me out forever?

646
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,728
At least long enough
for Dean and Cass

647
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,263
to get the tablet
and get out.

648
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,148
Castiel.

649
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,150
So, that's who's been
poking my boys --

650
00:35:05,152 --> 00:35:07,736
and not in a sexy way.

651
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,289
Got a bone to pick with you,
moose.

652
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:14,025
After what you did
to my poor dog.

653
00:35:14,027 --> 00:35:17,129
You gonna talk us to death
or get down to it already?

654
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:19,715
<i>There's</i> my whore.

655
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:23,685
I'm not here
for my dearly departed, though.

656
00:35:23,687 --> 00:35:26,055
I'm here for the stone
with the funny scribbles on it.

657
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,207
That's not gonna happen.

658
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,726
Love it
when you get all tough.

659
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,262
Touches me right where
my bathing suit goes.

660
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:37,433
Go.

661
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:41,236
Save your brother...
and my unicorn.

662
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:48,026
Timon and Pumbaa...

663
00:35:49,229 --> 00:35:51,280
...tell you
their big plan?

664
00:35:53,783 --> 00:35:56,452
Did they share
that little chestnut with you?

665
00:35:58,371 --> 00:36:02,024
They mean to close
the Gates of Hell, sweetheart.

666
00:36:03,676 --> 00:36:06,295
They mean to kill me
and all the demons --

667
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,846
you included.

668
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:13,135
You had me at "kill you,"
Crowley.

669
00:36:16,272 --> 00:36:20,092
So, this "Naomi"
has been controlling you

670
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,261
since she got you
out of Purgatory?

671
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,645
Yeah.

672
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:26,365
Well, w-what broke
the connection?

673
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,701
I don't know.

674
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:33,489
I just know that I have to
protect this tablet now.

675
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,492
From Naomi?

676
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,377
Yes.

677
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:43,332
And from you.

678
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:46,168
From me?
What are you talking about?

679
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:50,606
Cass?

680
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,057
Cass!

681
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:53,058
Damn it.

682
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,060
Dean!

683
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:56,728
Dean.

684
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,763
Where's Cass?

685
00:36:57,765 --> 00:36:59,348
He's gone.

686
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,349
Meg?

687
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,568
We got to go -- now.

688
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:14,913
I could beat on you
for eternity.

689
00:37:14,915 --> 00:37:18,667
Take all the time
you want, you pig.

690
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:24,155
No Cass
in the back seat.

691
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:27,543
Your stone is long gone.

692
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,127
Aah!

693
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,602
Naomi.

694
00:37:58,004 --> 00:38:00,570
Fancy meeting you here.

695
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:03,274
Haven't seen you
in a dark age.

696
00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:06,043
Love the haircut.

697
00:38:07,128 --> 00:38:08,712
How's the shoulder?

698
00:38:09,598 --> 00:38:11,298
Just a flesh wound.

699
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,736
Now,
I don't have the tablet,

700
00:38:15,738 --> 00:38:18,589
and if you're here,
neither do you.

701
00:38:18,591 --> 00:38:22,610
Which means that your Castiel
is in the wind with our prize.

702
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:26,530
If I didn't know you better, I'd
say you're losing your touch.

703
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:29,216
Castiel isn't
in the wind.

704
00:38:29,218 --> 00:38:31,318
He's doing exactly
what he's supposed to do --

705
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,037
protect the tablet.

706
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:34,154
Even from you?

707
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:37,274
Easy, love.

708
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:40,728
If you remember our time
in Mesopotamia the way I do,

709
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:44,064
you know I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

710
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:45,899
What do you want,
you cockroach?

711
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:51,088
Maybe we can make a deal

712
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,341
before this gets
truly bollocksed.

713
00:38:54,343 --> 00:38:57,177
I mean, I must have something
that you want.

714
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,233
Tart stole my move.

715
00:39:09,774 --> 00:39:12,743
So...what happened?

716
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:16,113
I mean,
Cass touched the tablet,

717
00:39:16,115 --> 00:39:19,049
and it reset him to his
factory settings or something?

718
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:21,001
I don't know.
And I don't care.

719
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:23,170
All I know is that he is
off the reservation

720
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:25,789
with a-a heavenly WMD.

721
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:33,130
Listen, man, I can't take
any more lies -- from <i>anyone.</i>

722
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:42,639
Yeah.

723
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,108
Um...

724
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,976
I know.

725
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:50,147
I'm sorry.

726
00:39:50,149 --> 00:39:52,449
I should have told you.

727
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:55,035
I-I...just wanted to believe
I was okay.

728
00:39:55,037 --> 00:39:55,953
I don't know.

729
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:57,687
Well, you heard
what Cass said --

730
00:39:57,689 --> 00:40:00,374
that that first trial hurt you in ways
that even <i>he</i> can't heal.

731
00:40:00,376 --> 00:40:03,460
Sammy, I need you
to be honest with me

732
00:40:03,462 --> 00:40:06,480
from here on out, man.

733
00:40:06,482 --> 00:40:08,048
You're right.

734
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,000
And I <i>will</i> be.

735
00:40:11,836 --> 00:40:13,837
Listen, I may not be able
to carry the burden

736
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,141
that comes along
with these trials...

737
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:19,560
But I can carry you.

738
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:25,315
You...realize

739
00:40:25,317 --> 00:40:27,717
you kind of just quoted
"Lord of the Rings," right?

740
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,154
Come on, man. But it's
the Rudy Hobbit, all right?

741
00:40:30,156 --> 00:40:31,989
Rudy Hobbit
always gets a pass.

742
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:34,241
Shut up.

743
00:40:36,828 --> 00:40:39,496
? ...is the undisputed truth

744
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,902
? but I have to have things
my own way ?

745
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:48,622
? to keep me in my youth

746
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:52,676
? like a ship
without an anchor ?

747
00:40:52,678 --> 00:40:54,762
? like a slave without a chain

748
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:56,764
? just the thought
of those sweet ladies ?

749
00:40:56,766 --> 00:40:59,099
? sends a shiver
through my veins ?

750
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:01,051
? and I will go on shining

751
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:03,020
? shining like brand-new

752
00:41:03,022 --> 00:41:04,855
? I'll never look behind me ?

753
00:41:04,857 --> 00:41:07,107
? my troubles will be few

754
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:12,112
? goodbye, stranger,
it's been nice ?

755
00:41:12,114 --> 00:41:15,866
? hope you find your paradise

756
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:19,936
? tried to see
your point of view ?

757
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:23,791
? hope your dreams
will all come true ?

758
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:27,628
? goodbye, Mary,
goodbye, Jane ?

759
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,298
? will we ever meet again?

760
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,118
? Feel no sorrow,
feel no shame ?

761
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,172
? come tomorrow,
feel no pain ?

762
00:41:38,174 --> 00:41:40,340
? sweet devotion

763
00:41:40,342 --> 00:41:41,958
? it's not for me ?

764
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,011
? just give me motion

765
00:41:44,013 --> 00:41:46,146
? and set me free

766
00:41:46,148 --> 00:41:48,649
? and land and the ocean

767
