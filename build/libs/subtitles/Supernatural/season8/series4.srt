00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,985
? <i>Oh</i> ?

2
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:10,825
? <i>What's the matter?</i> ?

3
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:16,714
? <i>What's the matter with you</i>
<i>lately?</i> ?

4
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,499
? <i>What's the matter?</i> ?

00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:22,970
? <i>What's the matter with you</i>
<i>lately?</i> ?

6
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:31,346
? <i>Oh, your love</i>
<i>is never good enough</i> ?

7
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:36,684
? <i>Oh, your love is lost on me</i> ?

8
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,404
Rest of the place
is clear.

9
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:42,607
Yeah. Uh...no I.D.
on this one.

10
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:48,329
Um...and no clue
who is painted on the walls.

11
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,665
Well, whatever happened,
looks like we missed it.

12
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:52,667
Yeah. Great.

13
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:57,021
Wait a second.

14
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,407
What the hell?

18
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:26,284
<i>Hey, Christopher Nolan.</i>

19
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,536
<i>Yeah?</i>
<i>Lens cap.</i>

20
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:30,405
Oh, crap. Damn.

21
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:32,740
Strong work, genius.

22
00:01:32,742 --> 00:01:35,209
Dude, I have no idea
what to make this movie about.

23
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:37,128
And I'm, like --
I'm A/V Club President,

24
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,947
so, you know,
it's got to be good.

25
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:41,182
Here. Give me that.

26
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,050
I'll tell you what
you're gonna make it about.

27
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:44,452
You're gonna make it?
Okay.

28
00:01:44,454 --> 00:01:47,171
In a world where nothing
is what it seems...

29
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:52,810
...one brave, shockingly
handsome, virile young man

30
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,729
and his faithful,

31
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:57,965
learning-disabled, robotic manservant...
Oh, no.

32
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:02,770
...must battle through waves
of cybernetic asshats

33
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:04,689
in order to sexually liberate
the women of --

34
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,240
Okay. Give me that.
Give me that.

35
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:11,979
Oh, please.

36
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:14,148
I bet at least one of these
girls would let you partake

37
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,117
in their awkward-guy
experimental phase.

38
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,002
What? These girls?

39
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,170
Yep.

40
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,006
Okay. #fails.

41
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,591
Homeschooled.

42
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:26,377
Secretly in love
with her roommate.

43
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,262
Listens to country music.

44
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,833
Oh, dude, dude.
12:00, blonde.

45
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:34,719
Yeah.
Wait. Is she -- oh, crap, crap.

46
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,188
Dude, take it, take it. Just take it.
I don't want to take it.

47
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,640
Were you just filming me?

48
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:41,225
No.
Uh, I wouldn't do that.

49
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,561
Does it have
the new firmware?

50
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,781
Uh, yes. Yes, it does.

51
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:48,065
How's it handle?

52
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,184
You tell me.

53
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,406
Well,
your settings are way off.

54
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,024
Oh, I-I like the way
the colors --

55
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:58,543
you probably don't care
about that.

56
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,411
Yeah, so,
you <i>weren't</i> checking me out?

57
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,713
Well, I do have a thing
for beautiful women

58
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,082
who respect their privacy.

59
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:09,337
Uh, dick move on my part.
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,871
Don't be.

61
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:13,374
I have a thing
for guys with cool cameras.

62
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:38,899
Hey.

63
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,378
No, no, no.
Look, it's a great movie,

64
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,132
but of the two, I-I prefer
"Last Year at Marienbad."

65
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,083
You know?

66
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:58,252
Yeah.
It's a classic.

67
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:00,688
Yeah. How do you like
that lens?

68
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,891
It's good. Yeah, yeah.
It's lighter for sure.

69
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:05,142
It's good.

70
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:09,397
You know, uh, Michael knows
nothing about cameras, right?

71
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:13,901
Yeah. But, uh,
I'm teaching him.

72
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:15,036
Teaching who?

73
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,770
Oh, my boyfriend.

74
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:20,124
He's, uh, big, tall,
and handsome.

75
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,959
Mm. Sounds delish.

76
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,444
Yeah,
you should totally meet him.

77
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:27,131
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

78
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,751
Let's see.
Five years from now?

79
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:36,090
Hopefully passed the bar exam,
practicing law.

80
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:39,427
Nothing corporate,
something, uh...

81
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:42,480
something green,
you know?

82
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,931
Green is good.

83
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:45,299
Hippie.

84
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,168
Oh, shut up.

85
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,153
Oh, geez.

86
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,439
Uh, maybe, like,
working for HBO

87
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,608
or -- or,
like, Michael Moore.

88
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,609
That'd be cool.

89
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:56,027
Double hippie.

90
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,812
Whatever.

91
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:01,365
I will be on a boat
in the middle of the ocean

92
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,484
with my beautiful girl
by my side.

93
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:05,819
Aww...sap.

94
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:07,171
And you can come, too.

95
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:10,508
Nice. See what you
just did there?

96
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,179
...Display of that,

97
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,765
let's make sure we put
our hand up first next time.

98
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:20,134
All right, brains, let's get
our pens and pencils out.

99
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:22,103
It's time for notes.

100
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,804
So, let's turn our attention

101
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:26,140
to our cruelly nicknamed friend
Piggy.

102
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:29,644
He uses his glasses
to create fire, the sun dial.

103
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:30,945
He's also rational.

104
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:34,148
He inhabits rational thought
on the island.

105
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,566
What'd I miss?

106
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,536
Just another pitch-perfect
lecture from Professor Ludensky.

107
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,520
Yeah.

108
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,405
Do you know Simon
was a Christ figure?

109
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,490
Yeah.

110
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:43,691
No.

111
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,493
Please tell me
you taped it.

112
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:46,744
Come on.
Who loves you?

113
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,295
Aww.
I wish I could quit you.

114
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:50,464
Yeah, right. Yeah.

115
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:53,367
Oh, hey.
Watch it, asshat!

116
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:54,585
What'd you call me?

117
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,221
Come on. Let's move.
I want to see it.

118
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,374
Let's go.

119
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:02,510
Oh, man.

120
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,430
Hey, can you shoot
some of this for my movie?

121
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,983
Is that legal?
Who cares?

122
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:14,689
Yeah,
that's not good.

123
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,357
Someone got murdered
on campus?

124
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,659
You guys live two blocks
from here.

125
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:21,996
Look, look, look.
Starsky and Hutch.

126
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:23,497
Rizzoli and Isles.

127
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,667
Special Agent Rose, and
this is Special Agent Hudson.

128
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,369
What the hell are you guys
doing here?

129
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,404
Our jobs. You want to tell us
what's going on?

130
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:31,539
Whatever you say, boss.

131
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,791
Got a call from a woman
that lives upstairs.

132
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,376
Said, uh,
she heard an attack,

133
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:37,411
came down,
found her neighbor here.

134
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:40,214
Jacob Carter.

135
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:42,099
Who'd he say?
Uh, Jacob Carter?

136
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,551
I don't know.
Well, is the witness still home?

137
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:47,438
Sure is. She's not
the most reliable type.

138
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,973
She said she heard
some kind of growl,

139
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,358
like there was a coyote
down here.

140
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,376
Awesome.

141
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,695
So, the FBI is here.

142
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:57,898
Your neighbor got murdered,
but you're totally cool.

143
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,484
No. It's not --
it's not that I'm cool.

144
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,737
It's just that,
like...I mean,

145
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:05,623
that it's good
that the FBI are here, right?

146
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,241
That -- that is
so annoyingly logical.

147
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:10,077
Hey, baby. Listen.

148
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,380
? <i>Oh, your love is lost on me</i> ?

149
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:16,584
Oh. It's pretty.
What is it?

150
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:19,336
It's the song that was playing
when we first met.

151
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:23,057
Aww. You are so
disgustingly sweet.

152
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:25,176
You ready?
Yeah.

153
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,845
- Cool. I got to go.
- What?

154
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,963
So, you just foam the runway
with our song

155
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:31,732
and then you got to
head out the door?

156
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:34,935
I promised I'd help him test
the new cameras.

157
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,020
Don't give me that crap.

158
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,188
I know you two idiots

159
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,190
are gonna go shoot cut scenes
for "Jackass."

160
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,524
Come on.

161
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,327
We both know he has nobody else
to do this with. Rain check.

162
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,313
Whatever.
You're dead to me.

163
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:48,833
Mm.

164
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,084
Do something cool.

165
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:52,319
Dude, this tree is awesome.
Hang on.

166
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:55,372
Maybe I could -- maybe I
could...get upside down and --

167
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,957
No, no, I said cool.
Ha ha.

168
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,991
This is stupid.

169
00:07:57,993 --> 00:07:59,543
Can you get --
can you see me?

170
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,463
Gonna try and get --
is this cool?

171
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:04,498
'Cause, man,
it feels pretty cool.

172
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,800
It's like "Dumb & Dumber 3."

173
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:06,851
Ha ha ha. Okay.

174
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,469
Wait, dude, dude, dude, dude.
What?

175
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:10,003
Turn around. Turn around.
What?

176
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,972
Turn. It's those FBI guys.
What?

177
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:14,308
Help -- help me down this tree.
Help me out of the tree.

178
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,476
Oh, all right.

179
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,010
Well, thank you, guys,
very much for your help.

180
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,813
You're free to go.

181
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,234
All right.
There is not a case.

182
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,237
There <i>is</i> a case here.
You're rusty.

183
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,022
We just got to dig
a little deeper. Come on.

184
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:35,913
Dude, it's so crazy.

185
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,748
Is it just me
or are you getting

186
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,251
a workplace-romance vibe
from those two?

187
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,468
Let's go.
Yeah.

188
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:47,141
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

189
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:48,843
Come here, come here. Look,
look, look, look, look, look.

190
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:49,844
What?

191
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,433
Yes.

192
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,485
D-bags
mating in the wild.

193
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:04,909
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.
Yeah.

194
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,528
Oh!

195
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,414
Stop.

196
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,116
Stop!
Hey!

197
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:17,237
Strike three. You're a dick.
Come on!

198
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,006
What's your problem?!
This is gonna look great on YouTube.

199
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,576
Oh. Oh, crap.
Oh, crap.

200
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:25,262
Hey!
What the hell?!

201
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,014
Oh, crap, crap.
Oh, God.

202
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:36,807
Hey, Brian, Brian!

203
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,442
Meet me
at Scott's mother's house!

204
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,093
Oh, God.

205
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,697
Oh, come on.
I paid her fair and square, man!

206
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,051
Thanks for a great night out,
Bri.

207
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:07,888
Hello?

208
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,890
Hello?

209
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:11,558
Scott, cut it out, man!

210
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:18,899
Oh, God.

211
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,517
Oh, God.

212
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:34,815
Hey, Michael.
You can come out now, dude.

213
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:37,484
Scott looked for us
for a while but bailed.

214
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:40,955
Mike?

215
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,543
Mike? Dude.

216
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,012
Oh, my God. Dude.

217
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,931
Michael.
You okay, man?

218
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,466
I'm okay.

219
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:53,717
What happened?

220
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,970
I don't know.
I don't know.

221
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:59,606
Oh, God.

222
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:03,176
Kate!

223
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:07,448
Oh, my God!
Baby, baby, baby, baby!

224
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,782
Something bit Michael.

225
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,703
Okay.
Oh, my God.

226
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,372
What is it?
Is it bad?

227
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,957
Brian.
Kate.

228
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,575
Is it bad?

229
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,245
The bite --
the bite's gone.

230
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,080
911.
What's your emergency?

231
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,299
Did -- did you dicks
just punk me?

232
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:27,501
Is anybody there? Hello?
What? It's completely gone.

233
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:29,086
Baby, it's okay.

234
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,338
Hey, hey, hey.
Honey, it's okay.

235
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,057
It's okay. Babe.

236
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,977
The doctor said
he's gonna be fine.

237
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:39,063
You heard him.

238
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,782
Literally not a scratch
on the kid.

239
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,536
If anything happens to Michael,
I-I don't know what I would do.

240
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,572
Shh. It's okay.

241
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,730
What?

242
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,033
Baby.
Uh...

243
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,952
Did you just pull that off?
Whoa. Whoa.

244
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,790
Okay. Okay, okay.
Now -- now one-handed.

245
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,077
Oh, my God!

246
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,929
Stay still, stay still,
stay still.

247
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,597
Dude, whoa!

248
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,470
Maybe you got bit
by an alien.

249
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,689
That would explain
the FBI.

250
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,124
Or maybe a mutant bit you.

251
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,110
Am I a superhero now?

252
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,811
Baby.

253
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:46,830
What are you doing?

254
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,416
What do you think
I'm doing?

255
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,468
I finally found
my movie.

256
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,787
What?

257
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,674
Michael?
Michael is not your movie.

258
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,810
We don't even know
what happened to him.

259
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,062
Exactly.

260
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:05,516
I'm gonna get Michael's
origin story on-camera.

261
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:10,804
You're kind of
creeping me out, man.

262
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:14,024
Seriously,
nothing superheroic to see here.

263
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,609
Just a delicious bagel.

264
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:18,912
Hey, man, I have this idea.

265
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:23,500
It's gonna sound really weird,
but don't laugh, okay?

266
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,203
No promises.

267
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:34,494
I, um...I really want to
be able to do what you do.

268
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:36,897
So I-I think maybe we could go
back out there

269
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,632
and get that thing
to bite me,

270
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:42,603
and then we could both be superheroes.
Stop! What? Are you serious?

271
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:44,221
Michael, you can't keep this
to yourself.

272
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,406
Keep what to myself?

273
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,008
We don't even know
what this thing is.

274
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,145
Why the hell
would you want it?

275
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:54,148
Michael...I don't -- I don't
want to be Piggy anymore, man.

276
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,951
You're -- you're not a pig,
man.

277
00:13:57,953 --> 00:14:00,287
Brian, listen to me.
There's nothing wrong with you.

278
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,289
You've just got to figure out
what it is you want

279
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,957
and go after it.

280
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,744
I'm telling you --
you don't want this.

281
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,546
Right, 'cause I don't
want to be super-strong

282
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:13,250
or have a prayer of getting
any ass this year or...

283
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,085
Please, please.

284
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,887
No, man!

285
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,472
No.

286
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,014
Not it.
Not it.

287
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:30,601
Children.

288
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:40,694
Dudes, dudes, dudes.
It's the FBI.

289
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:41,778
What?

290
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,449
It's the FBI.
No.

291
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:50,237
Baby,
what are you doing?

292
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,739
Hi, there.
Hi.

293
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:54,241
Special Agents rose
and Hudson.

294
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:55,742
We wanted to ask you
a few questions

295
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:58,295
about the murder that occurred
a few blocks from here.

296
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,631
First off, did you know
the victim, Jacob Carter?

297
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,299
Um, no, not really.

298
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,469
Do you remember anything unusual
about that night?

299
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,687
Not that I recall.

300
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:07,921
Right.

301
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:09,756
Well, uh, heard about anyone
in the neighborhood getting,

302
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:12,476
uh -- getting bit?

303
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:16,113
Humor me.
No, I-I don't think so.

304
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,615
All right. Well, no worries.
How about this?

305
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,235
If you hear
anything strange...

306
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:23,870
call us...

307
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:25,872
No matter how late.

308
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:26,907
Okay.

309
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:28,041
Thanks.

310
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:30,460
Thank you.

311
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,131
So, what do you think?

312
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,782
Well, based on
what we've got so far,

313
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:37,718
we could be dealing
with another Mayan God.

314
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,503
Ah, that's fantastic,

315
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,138
'cause the other one
was such a joy.

316
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,140
Campus dormitories?

317
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,675
Yep.

318
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:52,799
The FBI are looking
for what bit you.

319
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:55,302
Are you an "X-file"?

320
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:59,606
No. He's not an "X-file."
Listen.

321
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:06,313
<i>...So far, we could be</i>
<i>dealing with another Mayan God.</i>

322
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:07,664
I'm a golden God.

323
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,334
I am a golden God!

324
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,919
Ha ha, whoo!

325
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,921
You guys are ridiculous.

326
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,194
I am a golden God.

327
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:45,669
I am a God.

328
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:00,000
Huh?

329
00:17:58,226 --> 00:18:01,278
What's up, BVC?

330
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,264
It's Scotty P. patrolling
with the Oak Hill crew --

331
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:09,035
Doug...Evan...Tucker.

332
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:12,155
See, some animal killed
a local citizen,

333
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,824
so we're out here tonight

334
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,460
making sure
these streets are safe

335
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,129
for all you fine honeys
out there, all right?

336
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,330
Let's fan out, boys.

337
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,998
All right.
Let's go.

338
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,557
Yo!

339
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,260
Back off, douche-wheel.
Not tonight.

340
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:36,629
Ooh. Oh.
Ooh, I'm so scared.

341
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:38,465
Listen...

342
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:41,268
What...what the...?

343
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,655
Yeah, I got you now,
you piece of...

344
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:53,029
Why don't you come take
your beating like a man?

345
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:01,872
If you won't come out
and play,

346
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,591
I'll go visit
that little piece of yours.

347
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:06,042
Kate?

348
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,929
Yeah, I'll got visit Katie,
show her what a real man --

349
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,099
Michael?

350
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,607
Dude, do you think
this is funny?!

351
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:23,276
Come on! Cut it out.

352
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:36,420
Can I ask you something
about him?

353
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:39,834
With everything
that's happened,

354
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:41,119
are you afraid of him?

355
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:45,790
At first, yeah.

356
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,593
I mean,
it was pretty scary.

357
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:53,348
But...then,
to be totally honest,

358
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,184
it's actually been
pretty hot.

359
00:19:58,188 --> 00:20:00,688
O...M...G.

360
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,810
Baby?

361
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:08,613
Just...

362
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:10,097
Can you tell us
what happened?

363
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:12,817
I, uh --
I ran into Scott.

364
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:15,320
He chased me,
and I think I killed him.

365
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:16,321
What?

366
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:18,156
Turn it off.

367
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:19,657
Off!

368
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,945
He started talking about you,
and I saw red.

369
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:28,850
The next thing I remember,
I was running home.

370
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,669
On the video...

371
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:33,755
What were those things
on your hands?

372
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:35,757
Claws?
Did anybody see you?

373
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,792
Kate, you're not trying to justify --
No.

374
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:40,061
We don't know what happened,
Brian.

375
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,063
What?
He can't defend himself?

376
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:43,898
Give me this.

377
00:20:48,404 --> 00:20:49,520
Hey, whoa, whoa.

378
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:50,738
Figured
I'd see you guys again.

379
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,023
Well,
if you did your job right,

380
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:53,741
we wouldn't be here,
would we?

381
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:56,110
Easy. Uh, so, what do you got?
Vic's name was Scott Parker.

382
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:58,162
Looks like the same thing
that killed the Carter kid

383
00:20:58,164 --> 00:20:59,313
got Mr. Parker here.

384
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:00,648
Wait. Same <i>thing?</i>

385
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,983
Look,
I-I'm only the local yokel,

386
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:06,204
but this kid was shredded
by an animal.

387
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:08,623
Where's his heart?

388
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,508
Patrolman found it
up the way there.

389
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,659
Eaten mostly.

390
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:14,462
Show us.

391
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:20,718
Brian, wait.

392
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:26,724
Did you eat
a human heart?

393
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:28,726
Did you?
What are you talking about?

394
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:31,529
What is he talking about?
Scott's dead.

395
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:33,147
He was shredded,
and his heart's gone.

396
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:34,532
That doesn't mean
that Michael --

397
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:36,033
What do you think
happened to it?

398
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:37,318
Where's his heart,
Michael?

399
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,953
I don't remember what happened.
Don't lie to me!

400
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,371
Hey, Brian, calm down!

401
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:44,959
Look, I mean, there's got to be
an explanation for this.

402
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:46,627
Really?

403
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:51,582
It was...self-defense.
Eating a heart is self-defense?

404
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:53,418
Kate, who are you trying
to convince? Me or yourself?

405
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,886
You need to back off.

406
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:59,257
Why?
You gonna eat my heart, too?

407
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:02,677
Michael!

408
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:07,098
I don't know
what's happening to me.

409
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,018
I don't know
who I am anymore.

410
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,155
You're Michael Wheeler.

411
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:18,476
And you're mine, okay?
You hear me?

412
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:28,920
We have to call
the police.

413
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:31,405
Brian.

414
00:22:31,407 --> 00:22:33,090
Kate,
how -- how can you?

415
00:22:33,092 --> 00:22:35,743
You have to see
what's really going on here.

416
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:38,679
Whatever he is, it's not good --
it's not good for you.

417
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:40,465
Michael didn't mean
to hurt you.

418
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:41,716
Obviously he did, Kate.

419
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:43,434
You just don't get it,
do you?

420
00:22:43,436 --> 00:22:45,186
What?
What don't I understand?

421
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:47,088
You've never been
in love.

422
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:53,644
What we need
are answers.

423
00:22:58,033 --> 00:22:59,767
I can't hear them.

424
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:02,203
Seriously, Kate,
what are we doing?

425
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:05,406
What are we doing?
Seriously?

426
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:08,242
Wait. Kate, don't.

427
00:23:09,995 --> 00:23:12,330
Cut marks
on both vics are clean

428
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:14,782
but have the curvature
of animal claws.

429
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:15,917
I don't know.

430
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,886
I mean, maybe there's
a wild animal on the loose?

431
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:21,722
Biggest animal in the county
is a raccoon.

432
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:22,723
Hmm.

433
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:24,392
Thank you for your time.
You bet.

434
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:26,427
Appreciate it.
Okay.

435
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:28,796
Hey. No, no.

436
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:29,730
Hey.

437
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:31,732
So, what did I miss?
Anything?

438
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:34,485
Not unless you want to put
an A.P.B. out on Rocky Raccoon.

439
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:35,520
Great.

440
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:37,688
Um, the local police files
are not online,

441
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,740
so I had to dig
through the county records.

442
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:42,610
Um, 10 years ago, there was
a similar unsolved murder.

443
00:23:42,612 --> 00:23:43,644
Check it out.

444
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:46,030
Death by claws and, uh,
lack of heart?

445
00:23:46,032 --> 00:23:47,147
So we're talking a --

446
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:50,484
No. Not that time
of the month.

447
00:23:50,486 --> 00:23:52,620
Awesome.
Yeah.

448
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:56,040
Time to hit the books
and feed the monster.

449
00:23:58,176 --> 00:24:01,128
They know something.
We got to follow them.

450
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,515
Michael.
Come on. Michael.

451
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,551
Geez.

452
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:08,603
How'd you find us?

453
00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:11,272
GPS in your phones.

454
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:13,507
Duh.

455
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:16,176
You know, you're starting
to creep me out, man.

456
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:19,030
The feeling's mutual,
dude.

457
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:22,066
What else can you hack into,
Brian?

458
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:24,619
Anything.

459
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,626
Test, test. Can you hear me?

460
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:33,127
Copy that.

461
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:37,415
Yeah, the feed is looping
to my laptop right now.

462
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:39,850
Head in, make sure
you're within spitting distance,

463
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:41,368
and we should be
in business.

464
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:45,222
Um,
and don't get arrested.

465
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:46,424
Okay.

466
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:47,425
I'll do it.

467
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:50,061
You sure?
Yeah. Give me the bag.

468
00:25:02,024 --> 00:25:04,725
We good?

469
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:06,944
Uh...a little left.

470
00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:11,065
How's that?

471
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:15,453
Awesome. Thank you.

472
00:25:15,455 --> 00:25:16,837
Thanks.

473
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:19,907
Dude, two burgers?

474
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:23,761
Hey, I didn't eat at Big P's
for like a year, okay?

475
00:25:23,763 --> 00:25:26,380
Clear eyes
and clogged arteries --

476
00:25:26,382 --> 00:25:27,965
can't lose.

477
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:31,769
Hey, check this out.

478
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:33,270
"Werewolves
that are turned

479
00:25:33,272 --> 00:25:35,856
up to four generations
from pureblood..."

480
00:25:35,858 --> 00:25:39,276
Think he means Alpha?

481
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:41,278
"...are less feral
and can transform

482
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,398
before, during,
and after the lunar cycle."

483
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,866
Boom.

484
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:47,301
Let me see that.

485
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:49,537
<i>Purebloods don't black out</i>
<i>during the transformation.</i>

486
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:51,105
<i>They can control</i>
<i>themselves.</i>

487
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:53,941
Some have been able to subsist
off of animal hearts.

488
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,793
So -- so, what?

489
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:58,579
We're hunting a-a werewolf
with a pedigree?

490
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:00,948
Awesome.
Let's hope he has his papers.

491
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,967
Yeah, and that silver
can kill him.

492
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:04,301
So...what?

493
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:07,388
Best in show comes here 10 years
ago, ganked some poor woman.

494
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,173
Then when the dust settles
and everything's in the clear,

495
00:26:09,175 --> 00:26:10,474
he just sets up shop?

496
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:13,310
Yeah, comes for the human
hearts, stays for the co-eds.

497
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:14,345
Right.

498
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:15,730
And then everything's
wine and roses --

499
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:17,481
and animal tickers --

500
00:26:17,483 --> 00:26:19,100
until he gets the hankering
for human again.

501
00:26:19,102 --> 00:26:20,918
<i>Told you</i>
<i>there was a case here.</i>

502
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,405
<i>Now we just got to find it</i>
<i>and kill it.</i>

503
00:26:26,842 --> 00:26:30,478
I'm a werewolf.

504
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,595
A werewolf.

505
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:33,364
Michael, come on.
Baby, you need to calm down.

506
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:34,982
Calm down?  I'm a werewolf!
Hey, we need to find --

507
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:38,202
the FBI is trying to kill me.
Shut up! Everybody, shut up, okay?

508
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:40,087
First thing's first,
those guys --

509
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:42,590
those guys aren't FBI,
all right?

510
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:46,343
I'm pretty sure that FBI agents
don't say "awesome" that much.

511
00:26:46,345 --> 00:26:47,812
You know?

512
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:51,048
And -- and they definitely don't
hunt and kill college kids.

513
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,050
Did -- did they say
anything else?

514
00:26:53,052 --> 00:26:54,752
Dude, they just sat
and talked

515
00:26:54,754 --> 00:26:57,455
about how they have been apart
for a year.

516
00:26:57,457 --> 00:27:01,158
You were probably right about
that whole office-romance thing.

517
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,226
I'm screwed.

518
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:03,343
I'm screwed.

519
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:04,729
Kate, come on.
What are we supposed to do?

520
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:05,946
Okay, you know what?

521
00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:07,698
You guys, you're missing
the big picture, okay?

522
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,402
They -- they don't know
about you, Michael.

523
00:27:11,404 --> 00:27:14,021
They're looking for whoever,
whatever

524
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:18,409
bit you in the first place,
the pureblood.

525
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:20,661
That...

526
00:27:20,663 --> 00:27:24,215
that gives us
some time...

527
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:26,350
to figure it out,
you know?

528
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:27,501
So, what's the plan?

529
00:27:27,503 --> 00:27:30,371
What, eat chicken hearts
for the rest of my life?

530
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:33,491
Michael. Baby.

531
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:44,552
Yeah, okay, that sounds like
a great idea.

532
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:50,524
I'm a freaking werewolf.
That's a great idea.

533
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:52,393
I'm trying
to figure it out.

534
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:54,895
I'm trying to
figure it out, okay?

535
00:27:54,897 --> 00:27:57,598
Will you just
listen to me?

536
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,366
Hey, guys.

537
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:01,068
I think
I found something.

538
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,238
I'm not going anywhere,
okay?

539
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:46,446
Ah.

540
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:48,465
A little early
for office hours, Brian.

541
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:52,119
What can I help you with?

542
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:53,671
I know what you are.

543
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:20,778
Hey.
What are you doing?

544
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,330
We're leaving
in the morning.

545
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:24,565
What? Why?

546
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,567
Those guys -- look,
they might find Michael, and --

547
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:28,285
No, Kate, you don't have to
worry about that.

548
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:30,004
You don't have to worry
about anything.

549
00:29:30,006 --> 00:29:31,539
I took care of it.

550
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:34,908
You took care of what?

551
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:39,096
Brian, what did you do?

552
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:44,668
I know what you are.

553
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:48,589
Yeah,
I'm your professor.

554
00:29:48,591 --> 00:29:50,941
And thanks.
I've been looking for that.

555
00:29:50,943 --> 00:29:52,059
Where'd you find it?

556
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:55,596
Where you left it...
after you bit my friend.

557
00:29:55,598 --> 00:29:56,930
I'm sorry.
What are you --

558
00:29:56,932 --> 00:29:58,765
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop trying to cover.

559
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,434
Just listen to me
very carefully.

560
00:30:00,436 --> 00:30:02,036
I'm filming all this.

561
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:04,071
And I've got a hidden camera
in here, too.

562
00:30:04,073 --> 00:30:06,206
It's feeding back
to my laptop at home,

563
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,742
so if anything happens
to me --

564
00:30:08,744 --> 00:30:09,877
Nothing is going to happen
to you, Brian.

565
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:11,829
But you know what?
You need to calm down.

566
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:13,898
I want you to turn me
into a werewolf.

567
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:18,719
Brian, I-I don't know where you --
You don't know?

568
00:30:18,721 --> 00:30:22,590
Really?

569
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:24,458
Well, how about I, uh,
cut you with this.

570
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,677
Brian, listen to me.
This thing's made of silver, you know.

571
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,431
Look, I'm not -- please, I'm not
what you think that I am.

572
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:33,233
I don't care what you are.
I just want you to turn me.

573
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:39,990
I don't want to hurt you.

574
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:41,308
You're not going to,

575
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,779
'cause if you do,
all of this winds up on CNN.

576
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:52,486
So, you stumbled on Carter,
wolfed out, and then what?

577
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:54,588
Got a taste for hearts
again?

578
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,790
You never lose the taste,

579
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:59,259
if you're stupid enough
to have one.

580
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:00,661
Once you have
a human heart,

581
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:04,548
it's almost impossible
to control the monster inside.

582
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:09,186
But I did, until last week
when I, uh...

583
00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:12,106
fell off the wagon,
as they say.

584
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:16,143
You have no idea -- no idea --
how hard it is.

585
00:31:16,145 --> 00:31:19,063
I've trained myself
not to hurt anyone.

586
00:31:19,065 --> 00:31:21,899
I have --
I have trained myself to...

587
00:31:21,901 --> 00:31:23,517
choke down
those other hearts.

588
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,063
Animal hearts.

589
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:26,709
And I have been clean...

590
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,872
Until last week?

591
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,181
And then I saw Carter alone,
and he was...

592
00:31:37,183 --> 00:31:38,699
he looked so weak.

593
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:41,018
It's harder
to cover things up nowadays.

594
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,171
I knew a hunter would catch wind
of this sooner or later.

595
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:47,658
They did.
They're here.

596
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,511
You needed a patsy.

597
00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:51,712
Michael.

598
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:55,215
Yes.

599
00:31:55,217 --> 00:32:00,604
The young man who sleeps
through most of my lectures.

600
00:32:00,606 --> 00:32:03,390
I mean,
who would miss <i>him?</i>

601
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:05,826
Me.

602
00:32:05,828 --> 00:32:07,127
Why are you doing this?

603
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:09,663
I want to see
what you guys see...

604
00:32:09,665 --> 00:32:11,715
do what you do.

605
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:14,318
I'm sick of being Piggy.

606
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,336
I want to be Ralph.

607
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:19,039
We don't get to choose
who we are.

608
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:25,429
I did.

609
00:32:25,431 --> 00:32:27,965
Oh, my God.
Brian.

610
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:29,333
Oh, my God.
What are you? Insane?

611
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:32,052
You're welcome
for saving your ass.

612
00:32:32,054 --> 00:32:33,637
Look, watch.

613
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:49,102
Hey!

614
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:01,548
Thank you.

615
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:06,754
I've never killed
a pureblood before.

616
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,955
What was he looking at?

617
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:11,508
What the hell?

618
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:14,578
See?

619
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:17,464
Problem solved.

620
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:19,967
They killed the pureblood,
they're moving on,

621
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:22,419
and we're in the clear,
just like you said.

622
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:23,804
I never said --

623
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:26,356
Kate, I, uh...

624
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:29,760
I did this
to protect you.

625
00:33:29,762 --> 00:33:32,196
I did
what you couldn't.

626
00:33:32,198 --> 00:33:34,314
They saw the camera,
Brian.

627
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:36,266
You don't think they'll trace
that back to you?

628
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:38,035
What the hell's wrong
with you?

629
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:43,373
Nothing's wrong with me.

630
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,660
<i>You</i> told me that.

631
00:33:46,662 --> 00:33:50,497
I just...finally figured out
what I want,

632
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:51,765
and now
I'm going after it.

633
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:55,235
You thought
I was hiding behind <i>this?</i>

634
00:33:55,237 --> 00:33:57,221
I was hiding behind you.

635
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:04,077
I am done
living in your shadow.

636
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,064
I've always lived
in your shadow.

637
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:10,284
But now --
now we're equals.

638
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:12,419
Anything <i>you</i> can do, right?
What?

639
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:14,922
You think
this is a game?

640
00:34:14,924 --> 00:34:17,891
Do you have any idea
what you've done to yourself?

641
00:34:17,893 --> 00:34:19,860
Well, you wouldn't bite me, so I had to --
You asked him to?

642
00:34:19,862 --> 00:34:21,879
He asked you to bite him?

643
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:24,197
I didn't, okay?

644
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,866
I didn't
want to hurt you.

645
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:27,801
I would never hurt you,
Brian.

646
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:31,004
This thing inside of me --
you don't want this.

647
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:33,724
Oh, well,
it's too late for that now.

648
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:36,376
I remember attacking Scott.

649
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:38,595
I remember ripping his
beating heart out of his chest.

650
00:34:38,597 --> 00:34:40,314
I remember the look
in his dead eyes

651
00:34:40,316 --> 00:34:42,649
when I bit into that heart,
Brian.

652
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:44,852
And above all,
I remember how sweet,

653
00:34:44,854 --> 00:34:47,855
how delicious it tasted,
and ever since I've tasted it,

654
00:34:47,857 --> 00:34:50,891
I've felt more powerful
and more out of control.

655
00:34:52,728 --> 00:34:54,060
More weak.

656
00:34:54,062 --> 00:34:55,662
You don't need someone
like Michael.

657
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:56,786
You need someone that
can take care of you.

658
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,116
I can take care of myself.

659
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:01,251
Let her go.

660
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:05,289
Or what?
You gonna cry some more?

661
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:10,711
No! No!

662
00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:12,713
No! No!

663
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,249
No!

664
00:35:23,892 --> 00:35:27,394
God! God!

665
00:35:27,396 --> 00:35:28,979
God!

666
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:31,865
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby.

667
00:35:31,867 --> 00:35:33,283
Please don't die.

668
00:35:33,285 --> 00:35:35,586
Please don't die.
Please don't die.

669
00:35:37,622 --> 00:35:39,122
I love you, baby.

670
00:35:39,124 --> 00:35:41,959
I love you.

671
00:35:41,961 --> 00:35:43,994
Michael?

672
00:35:43,996 --> 00:35:45,412
Michael!

673
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:07,586
Kate, listen to me.
I love you. I love you.

674
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:10,372
You'll understand.
You just need to see what I see.

675
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:12,741
After I bite you,
you'll understand.

676
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:26,755
Kate?

677
00:36:26,757 --> 00:36:29,925
Let me in.

678
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:33,862
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

679
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:38,934
We can fix this. We can...
Just let me in, okay?

680
00:36:59,189 --> 00:37:02,591
Brian?

681
00:37:02,593 --> 00:37:05,677
Brian, I'm coming out.

682
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:08,847
I see it now.

683
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:10,933
I understand.

684
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:16,939
I told you
it would be all right.

685
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:18,974
Yeah.

686
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,977
It will be. Here.

687
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:30,702
No, no!

688
00:37:42,516 --> 00:37:47,319
I didn't finish Brian's movie
to justify what happened.

689
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:51,790
To be totally honest,

690
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:56,428
I'm not really even sure
if I understand it at all.

691
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,996
I just wanted you to know
that --

692
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:02,134
that Michael wasn't always
a monster.

693
00:38:02,136 --> 00:38:04,670
None of us were.

694
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,841
Five years from now?

695
00:38:09,843 --> 00:38:14,213
Hopefully passed the bar exam,
practicing law.

696
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:18,951
Nothing corporate,
something green, you know?

697
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:20,719
Oh, geez.

698
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:23,138
Uh, maybe, like,
working for HBO

699
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,973
or -- or,
like, Michael Moore.

700
00:38:24,975 --> 00:38:26,191
That'd be cool.

701
00:38:26,193 --> 00:38:28,327
I will be on a boat
in the middle of the ocean

702
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:30,596
with my beautiful girl
by my side.

703
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:31,813
Aww.

704
00:38:33,066 --> 00:38:35,017
? <i>What's the matter?</i> ?

705
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:37,686
? <i>what's the matter with you</i>
<i>lately?</i> ?

706
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:39,938
I'm leaving.

707
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,158
And you'll never hear from me
ever again.

708
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,495
Look, I know
that there's another way.

709
00:38:46,497 --> 00:38:50,866
I can eat animal hearts.

710
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:53,669
I've never hurt anyone.

711
00:38:53,671 --> 00:38:59,708
Nobody human, anyway.

712
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,878
I didn't choose this.

713
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,180
Please...

714
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:09,217
<i>Please give me a chance.</i>

715
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,239
Okay, so, uh...

716
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:34,879
...this -- yeah -- is Michael,
which means that that is...

717
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:38,767
Brian Wilcox, our friendly
neighborhood cameraman.

718
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:40,084
Right.

719
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,920
Mm.

720
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,272
All right, so...

721
00:39:44,274 --> 00:39:47,642
What, she's got about
a half-day jump on us?

722
00:39:47,644 --> 00:39:50,679
Mm-hmm.

723
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:52,447
You all right?

724
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:54,916
Mm-hmm.

725
00:39:54,918 --> 00:39:57,736
Look, Kate's right.

726
00:39:57,738 --> 00:40:01,606
She hasn't hurt anybody --
well, anybody human at least.

727
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:06,961
No, she didn't --
she didn't choose this.

728
00:40:06,963 --> 00:40:08,380
Let's give her a shot.

729
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:10,799
Seriously?

730
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:12,450
Yeah, yeah.

731
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,786
And, look,
if Kate pops back up,

732
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:18,723
I mean, if she strays,
then no questions asked.

733
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:23,094
We do what we got to do
and, um, we take her down.

734
00:40:24,513 --> 00:40:25,847
Hey, Sam?

735
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:27,098
Yeah?

736
00:40:29,436 --> 00:40:31,352
Do I really say "awesome"
a lot?

737
00:40:31,354 --> 00:40:34,689
No. No, no. No.

738
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:36,241
Mm.

739
00:40:40,163 --> 00:40:41,496
Huh.

740
00:40:46,168 --> 00:40:48,620
Awesome.

741
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:58,963
? <i>...with you lately?</i> ?

742
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:01,883
? <i>What's the matter?</i> ?

743
00:41:01,885 --> 00:41:07,672
? <i>What's the matter with you</i>
<i>lately?</i> ?

744
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:11,142
? <i>dreamer,</i>
<i>you will waste your time</i> ?

745
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:17,398
? <i>do you ever wonder why we go</i>
<i>on and on and on?</i> ?

746
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,570
? <i>Love is gone</i>
<i>and gone and gone</i> ?

747
00:41:22,572 --> 00:41:24,839
? <i>What's the matter?</i> ?

748
00:41:24,841 --> 00:41:28,359
? <i>What's the matter with you</i>
<i>lately?</i> ?
