00:00:00,621 --> 00:00:02,673
I think dad wants us
to pick up where he left off.

00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,448
Saving people,
hunting things...

00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,816
the family business.

4
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:11,793
There are things much older
than souls in purgatory.

5
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:14,297
? In the shuffling madness ?

6
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:15,266
Leviathan!

7
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:17,969
? Of the locomotive breath ?

8
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:19,805
Dick is coming.

9
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:21,374
? Runs the all-time loser ?

10
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:22,976
A shark's got to eat.

11
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:25,246
? Headlong to his death ?

12
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:26,314
Bobby!

13
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:29,785
? He picks up Gideon's Bible ?

14
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:32,588
? open at page one ?

15
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,923
When it's your time...

16
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:35,292
? Thank God ?

17
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:36,360
...go.

18
00:00:37,363 --> 00:00:40,299
? And the train,
it won't stop going ?

19
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:43,169
? no way to slow down ?

20
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:44,237
What the hell are you?

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,372
He's a Prophet
of the Lord.

22
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,041
And that's the word of God?
Yes.

23
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:48,242
It's about Leviathan.

24
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:50,178
Does it say anything
about how to kill them?

25
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,349
When we freaks die,
where do we go?

26
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:55,151
It's like the backside
of your worst nightmares.

27
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:58,121
It's all blood and bone
and darkness.

28
00:00:58,123 --> 00:00:59,556
Purgatory.

29
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:02,125
Cut off the head,
and the body will flounder.

30
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:05,496
Prophet's mine.

31
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,665
You are well and truly
on your own.

32
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,233
We're in Purgatory?

33
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,904
Cass, I think
we better g--

34
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,139
Cass?

35
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:37,933
Will, get up.

36
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:39,268
Something just happened.

37
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:50,147
Go.
Go do something.

38
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:52,050
W-what am I
supposed to...

39
00:01:56,457 --> 00:01:58,257
Hello?

40
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,461
Hello?

41
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:07,168
It was a deer.

42
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,936
I don't know. It was like --
it was a deer or some--

43
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:10,872
Oh!

44
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:14,175
Where am I?

45
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,377
What?

46
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:18,713
W-- hey, hey.

47
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:23,418
Where's the road?

48
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,420
12 miles that way.

50
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:58,325
? Another year
has passed me by ?

51
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:01,528
? still I look at myself
and cry ?

52
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,767
? what kind of man
have I become? ?

53
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,341
? all of the years I've spent
in search of myself ?

54
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:13,943
? and I'm still in the dark ?

55
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:19,649
? 'cause I can't seem
to find the light alone ?

56
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:24,021
? sometimes I feel ?

57
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:28,559
? like a man
in the wilderness ?

58
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:33,496
? I'm a lonely soldier
off to war ?

59
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:38,502
? sent away to die ?

60
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:44,241
? never quite knowing why ?

61
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:52,917
? sometimes it makes
no sense at all ?

62
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,687
? it makes no sense at all ?

63
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,691
This better be you,
you son of a bitch.

Hold on, you bastard.

65
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,947
Hold on!

Wow.

00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:04,788
Wow. That was fast.

71
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,757
No thanks to you.

72
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,892

so long?

73
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:13,097
You're welcome.

00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,168
Everything working?

75
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,004
Good enough.

76
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,178
So...

77
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,613

78
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:31,415
Like we talked about,
I guess.

79

Dean?!
What the --

87
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:31,569
I'm not a demon.

88
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:34,405
Or a Leviathan. What --

89
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:39,243
Or a shifter.

90
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:40,344
Good.

91
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:41,412
My turn.

92
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:42,680
Come on. Let's go.

93
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:44,681
I don't need to.
I know it's you.

94
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:46,817
Damn it, Sammy!

95
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:51,522
Come on!

96
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:52,356
No!

97
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:54,324
Dean,
can I just say hello?

98
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:01,498
All right.

99
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,068
Well...

100
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:07,705
...let's do this.

101
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:10,675
I don't know whether to give you
a hug or take a shower.

102
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:12,944
Come here.

103
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:22,220
Dude...

104
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:25,222
You're...freakin' alive.

105
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:28,192
I mean,
what the hell happened?

106
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:30,695
Well, I guess standing too close
to exploding Dick

107
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:32,763
sends your ass
straight to Purgatory.

108
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,366
You were in Purgatory?

109
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:38,769
For the whole year?

110
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:41,705
Yeah, time flies when
you're running for your life.

111
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:43,007
Well,
how'd you get out?

112
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:45,442
I guess
whoever built that box

113
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:47,211
didn't want me in there
any more than I did.

114
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:48,378
What does that mean?

115
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,314
I'm here, okay?

116
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,216
What about Cass?
Was he there?

117
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:57,421
Yeah,
Cass didn't make it.

118
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:01,622
What exactly
does that mean?

119
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:08,093
Something happened to him
down there.

120
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,994
Things got pretty hairy
towards the end,

121
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:13,631
and he...just let go.

122
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:19,368
So Cass is dead?
You saw him die?

123
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,036
I saw enough.

124
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:23,938
So, then what,
you're not sure?

125
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,307
I said
I saw enough, Sam.

126
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:31,278
Right.

127
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,913
Dean, I'm sorry.

128
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,315
Me too.

129
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,220
So you -- I can't believe
you're actually here.

130
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:46,357
You know that half your numbers
are out of service?

131
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:49,760
Felt like I was
leaving messages in the wind.

132
00:09:49,762 --> 00:09:52,663
Yeah, I-I-I didn't
get your messages.

133
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:54,931
How come?

134
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:57,167
Probably because
I ditched the phones.

135
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:58,635
Because...?

136
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,605
I guess, um...

137
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:05,807
I guess something happened
to me this year, too.

138
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:08,676
I don't hunt anymore.

139
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:11,678
Yeah.

140
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,980
And Sasha Grey's
gone legit.

141
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:17,250
What?

142
00:10:17,252 --> 00:10:18,184
Nothing.

143
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:20,586
Um, she did
a Soderbergh movie.

144
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:22,087
What?
She did a Soderbergh --

145
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,956
No. <i>You,</i> Sam.
You quit?

146
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,159
Yeah. Yeah, I --
you were gone...Dean.

147
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,361
Cass was gone,
Bobby was dead.

148
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,597
I mean,
Crowley even shipped off

149
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,766
Kevin and Meg
to parts unknown.

150
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,367
So you turned tail
on the family business.

151
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,736
Nothing says "family" quite like
the whole family being dead.

152
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,670
I wasn't dead.

153
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,609
In fact, I was knee-deep
in God's armpit

154
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,910
killing monsters,

155
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,746
which, I thought,
is what we actually do.

156
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,881
Yes, Dean.

157
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:52,216
And far as I knew,
what we do is the thing

158
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,619
that got every single member
of my family killed.

159
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,988
I had no one --
no one.

160
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,323
And for the first time in
my life, I was completely alone.

161
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,027
And, honestly, I didn't
exactly have a roadmap.

162
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:08,432
So, yeah, I fixed up the Impala,
and I just...drove.

163
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,003
After you looked for me.

164
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,308
Did you look for me,
Sam?

165
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,715
Good. That's good.

166
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,450
Now, we -- we...always
told each other

167
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,419
<i>not</i> to look for
each other.

168
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:32,323
That's smart.
Good for you.

169
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:35,559
Of course,
we always ignored that

170
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,362
because of our deep, abiding
love for each another,

171
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,464
but not this time,
right, Sammy?

172
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,767
Look, I'm still the same guy,
Dean.

173
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,569
Well, bully for you.

174
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,536
I'm not.

175
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:56,145
Welcome back.

176
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:03,152
You want some dinner?

177
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:05,388
Pass.

178
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,393
Okay.

179
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:32,882
What?

180
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,588

00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,793
<i>I don't know where I am.</i>

184
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,129
<i>And I don't know</i>
<i>if he or -- or any other demons</i>

185
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,363
<i>are still after me.</i>

186
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,398
<i>I need your help.</i>

187
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,600
<i>Call me back.</i>
<i>It's Kevin Tran.</i>

188
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,536
When was that?

189
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,972
<i>Sam Winchester.</i>
<i>It's Kevin Tran.</i>

190
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,473
<i>I called you a week ago.</i>

191
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,942
<i>Call me, please.</i>

192
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,945
<i>I don't know what the hell</i>
<i>I'm doing out here, man.</i>

193
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,680
Okay.

194
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:03,016
I get it.

195
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:05,319
So, what,
you want to...

196
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:07,354
strategize or something?

197
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:08,722
<i>Sam, it's Kevin.</i>

198
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:09,923
<i>I'm good.</i>

199
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:12,327
<i>Whoo! I'm so good.</i>

200
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,028
Is he...drunk?

201
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,231
<i>3 months</i>
<i>since you ditched my ass.</i>

202
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:19,134
<i>Haven't slept for more than</i>
<i>four hours a night.</i>

203
00:13:19,136 --> 00:13:20,336
<i>It's all good</i>
<i>in the hood.</i>

204
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:24,139
<i>Uh, if you're still alive,</i>
<i>eat me.</i>

205
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:29,144
<i>Eat me.</i>

206
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:32,248
<i>Sam, it's been 6 months.</i>

207
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,883
<i>I can only assume</i>
<i>you're dead.</i>

208
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:36,285
<i>If not,</i>
<i>don't try and reach me.</i>

209
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:37,386
<i>You won't be able to.</i>

210
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:39,588
<i>I won't be calling this number</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

211
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:47,563
He was
our responsibility.

212
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,401
And you couldn't answer
the damn phone.

213
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:02,145
All right,
listen to this --

214
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:03,379
Kevin's last message.

215
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:04,681
Listen
to the background.

216
00:14:05,717 --> 00:14:07,083
<i>If not,</i>
<i>don't try and reach me.</i>

217
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:08,518
<i>You won't be able to.</i>

218
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,020
<i>I won't be calling this number</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

219
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:11,254
Hear that?

220
00:14:11,256 --> 00:14:12,522
What is it?

221
00:14:12,524 --> 00:14:14,024
I think
he was on a bus.

222
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:15,258
Listen again.

223
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,327
<i>If not,</i>
<i>don't try and reach me.</i>

224
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:18,528
<i>Last stop -- Centreville.</i>

225
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,997
<i>...won't be calling</i>
<i>this number --</i>

226
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:23,066
Centreville?

227
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:25,535
Centreville, where?
Michigan.

228
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:27,270
And why would Kevin be
in Centreville, Michigan?

229
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,708
Because...
his high-school girlfriend

230
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,278
goes to college there.

231
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,413
That's thin.

232
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:38,647
It's the best lead
we got.

233
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:39,448
"We"?

234
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:44,152
You were right.

235
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:47,690
He was
our responsibility.

236
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:52,327
So...let's find him,
okay?

237
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:59,468
Hey.

238
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:05,741
Well...
No visible signs of douchery --

239
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:07,075
I'll give you that.

240
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,420
Smell like dog
to you?

241
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:23,258
In the car?

242
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,960
You tell me.

243
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:27,329
Hmm.

244
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:41,038
Aah!

245
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:48,745
Take a breath.

246
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,680
Calm down.

247
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:54,016
Where's the angel?

248
00:16:54,018 --> 00:16:55,785
You're him.

249
00:16:56,887 --> 00:16:57,853
The human.

250
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,821
Where's the angel?

251
00:16:58,823 --> 00:17:00,556
I don't know.

252
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,675
Aah!

253
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:01,749
You okay?

254
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,050
Yeah.

255
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,186
Yeah, hey,
what do you say

256
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:06,855
we blow this joint,
hit the road?

257
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:09,023
Now?

258
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:10,792
Yeah, Kevin's not getting
any more found.

259
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:12,259
The kid survived
a year without us.

260
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:14,061
He'll be okay for another
12 hours.

261
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:16,831
Besides, when's the last time
you slept?

262
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,401
Hmm.

263
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:20,202
What?

264
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:21,570
Nothing.

265
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:23,805
Is that, uh, that how you
rationalized taking a year off?

266
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:26,374
People will be okay?

267
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:28,209
People <i>were</i> okay, Dean.

268
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:29,177
You're okay.

269
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:31,479
Wow.

270
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:34,049
Look, I did
what we promised we'd do.

271
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:35,817
I moved on.
I lived my life.

272
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,286
Yeah, no,
I'm getting that.

273
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:41,056
Look, it wasn't like
I was...just oblivious.

274
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:42,691
I mean,
I read the paper every day.

275
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:44,325
I saw
the...weird stories,

276
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:46,695
the kind of stuff
we used to chase.

277
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:49,731
And you said what?
"Not my problem"?

278
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,166
Yes.

279
00:18:51,168 --> 00:18:52,734
And you know what?
The world went on.

280
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:53,968
People died, Sam.

281
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,370
People will always die,
Dean.

282
00:18:55,372 --> 00:18:57,272
Or maybe another hunter
took care of it.

283
00:18:57,274 --> 00:18:58,740
I don't know,
but the point is,

284
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:00,308
for the first time,
I realized

285
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,777
that it wasn't only up to me
to stop it.

286
00:19:03,746 --> 00:19:05,781
Hmm.

287
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:07,649
So what was it, hmm?

288
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:10,652
What could possibly
make you stop just like that?

289
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:14,490
A girl?

290
00:19:14,492 --> 00:19:16,559
Was there a girl?

291
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,760
The girl had nothing
to do with it.

292
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:20,062
There <i>was</i> a girl.

293
00:19:20,064 --> 00:19:23,432
Yeah. There was.

294
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:25,067
And then there wasn't.

295
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,471
Any more questions?

296
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:39,014
Listen, I know this is gonna
sound crazy to you.

297
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:40,916
I don't even necessarily
need you to understand.

298
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:45,019
But...you need to know.

299
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:47,054
I didn't just drop out,
Dean.

300
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:48,956
I found something.

301
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:53,493
Something I've...never had
all my life.

302
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:57,397
What was her name?

303
00:19:58,732 --> 00:19:59,999
Amelia.

304
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,200
So, what, you, uh,

305
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:03,035
you dropped your peanut butter
in her chocolate?

306
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:04,837
How'd it happen?

307
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,408
I hit a dog.

308
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,344
I knew I smelled dog.

309
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:12,645
And I knew
you'd throw a bitch fit.

310
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:14,681
Hey,
the rules are simple, Sam.

311
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:16,616
You don't take a joint
from a guy named Don,

312
00:20:16,618 --> 00:20:18,251
and there's no dogs
in the car!

313
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:22,122
All right,
what about you?

314
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:24,191
What about me?
Look at you.

315
00:20:24,193 --> 00:20:25,592
You've still
got that look.

316
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:27,127
You're shaky.
You're on edge.

317
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:31,732
What was it like?

318
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,205
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

319
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:38,807
Try me.

320
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:44,546
It was bloody.

321
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:47,516
Messy.

322
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:50,987
31 flavors
of bottom-dwelling nasties.

323
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:56,359
Hell, most days felt like
360-degree combat.

324
00:20:58,663 --> 00:21:01,098
But there was something
about being there.

325
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,968
Felt pure.

326
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:10,040
What?

327
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:13,744
No thanks
for saving your hide?

328
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:15,178
Sure.

329
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,348
I won't shove this
up your ass.

330
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,682
Mm.

331
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:22,185
Awful strange way to punch
your meal ticket, friend.

332
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:24,921
I got something
you need.

333
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:26,590
Yeah, what's that?

334
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:28,692
A way out.

335
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:32,329
Even a dentaenapocalypse
like you

336
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:33,697
knows
there's no such thing.

337
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:35,299
There is
if you're human.

338
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:38,001
God has made it so.

339
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:39,636
At least,
that's the rumor.

340
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:41,071
Bull.

341
00:21:41,073 --> 00:21:43,172
Suit yourself.

342
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:44,941
Maybe
you've gone native.

343
00:21:44,943 --> 00:21:46,876
Maybe you like
being man meat

344
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:49,245
for every
Tom, Dick, and Harry.

345
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:56,019
Prove it.

346
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:57,120
Nah.

347
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:59,522
You're either in
or you're out.

348
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:02,592
So you just want to
guide me out of Purgatory

349
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:04,660
out of the goodness
of your undead heart?

350
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:06,729
More or less.

351
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:08,031
What's in it for you?

352
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,399
I'm hopping a ride.

353
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:10,267
What?

354
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:12,635
It's a human portal,
jackass.

355
00:22:12,637 --> 00:22:15,305
Only humans
can pass through.

356
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:17,574
I show you the door,

357
00:22:17,576 --> 00:22:20,109
you hump my soul
to the other side.

358
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:23,346
So you're looking
for a soul train.

359
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:24,881
Sure.

360
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:27,117
If that's
what you're into.

361
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,052
And how do I know
this isn't a set-up?

362
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:30,753
How do I know
I ain't gonna end up

363
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:32,255
like your friend
over there?

364
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:34,257
He <i>was</i> my friend.

365
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,826
Now <i>you</i> are.

366
00:22:35,828 --> 00:22:38,562
First rule of Purgatory,
kid.

367
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:40,564
You can't trust nobody.

368
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:41,798
You just asked me
to trust you.

369
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,833
You see?

370
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:44,268
You're getting it now.

371
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:49,340
First
we find the angel.

372
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:52,209
Mm, three's a crowd,
chief.

373
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:55,079
Well, hey.

374
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:58,982
Either you're in
or you're out.

375
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:12,929
The last time I saw Kevin
was, like, a year ago.

376
00:23:12,931 --> 00:23:14,698
When he disappeared?

377
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,866
Mm-hmm.

378
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:17,300
He stole his mother's car
because he thought

379
00:23:17,302 --> 00:23:19,536
he was on a mission
from God or something?

380
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:20,604
It was crazy.

381
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:21,772
Shut up!

382
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:23,473
My friend Adam --
who got addicted to Adderall

383
00:23:23,475 --> 00:23:25,509
but got a perfs on his S.A.T.s,
so it was totally worth it --

384
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:26,943
same thing.
Shut up!

385
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:28,111
Seerse.
Mission from God.

386
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:29,779
Look, Channing,

387
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:31,548
we know
Kevin was here.

388
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,916
No, he wasn't.

389
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:34,050
And we understand
if you're trying to protect him.

390
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:37,287
But nobody can protect Kevin
better than we can.

391
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:39,022
I hate Kevin.
I wouldn't protect him.

392
00:23:39,024 --> 00:23:40,557
I thought
you two had a thing.

393
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,826
Yeah, when he
was going to Princeton.

394
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:46,263
Wow.
Just like that?

395
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:49,733
Mm-hmm.

396
00:23:52,704 --> 00:23:54,605
So why would Kevin
come sniffing around here

397
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,007
if not to see her?

398
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:56,974
No idea.

399
00:23:56,976 --> 00:23:58,576
Maybe
we should split up,

400
00:23:58,578 --> 00:24:00,912
ask around,
see if anybody's seen him?

401
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:04,449
Yeah, Asian kid, yea high,
at a university.

402
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,350
That should be easy.

403
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:09,186
Okay.

404
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:11,554
Are you ready to forget
all about what's-his-name?

405
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:13,690
Okay, this guy's name is Kyle,
he's Jewish,

406
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:15,958
um, I'm pretty sure
he has an Asian thing.

407
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,860
Perfs, right?

408
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:21,798
Shut up, bitch.

409
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:38,148
Inferni clamavi ad te regem
sermonos meos.

410
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,084
The Prophet still has not yet
shown his face to me.

411
00:24:41,086 --> 00:24:45,422
But you should know
Dean Winchester is back.

412
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:07,625
Help. I need help.
The dog needs help.

413
00:25:07,627 --> 00:25:08,726
That way!

414
00:25:08,728 --> 00:25:10,628
He just -- he just
came out of nowhere,

415
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,896
right
in front of my car.

416
00:25:11,898 --> 00:25:13,798
We need a doctor.
Are you a doctor?

417
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,533
The doctor's coming, sir.
But I'm not sure --

418
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:16,734
You're not sure
what?

419
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:19,070
This is an animal hospital.
You save animals.

420
00:25:19,072 --> 00:25:20,338
Sir.
Save this animal!

421
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,107
Roberta, can you escort
this gentleman out, please?

422
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:23,175
Yes.

423
00:25:23,177 --> 00:25:24,376
I did this.

424
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:25,677
Come on.

425
00:25:34,988 --> 00:25:37,190
Don't judge me.

426
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:39,692
I got bubkes.

427
00:25:39,694 --> 00:25:40,627
Well...

428
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:42,228
And here you go.

429
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,030
Ah, thank you.

430
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:45,464
Sweet mother of God.

431
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:48,968
It's for me?
Seriously?

432
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:51,804
Check this out.

433
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:53,306
So, I went through
campus security archives

434
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:55,075
around the time Kevin
should have been here.

435
00:25:55,943 --> 00:25:58,712
Anyone look familiar?

436
00:26:00,048 --> 00:26:00,948
Dude.

437
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,083
It's a burger.

438
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:03,585
It's treasure.

439
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:06,388
All right, so, what, Kevin
comes all the way to campus

440
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,589
and doesn't see
his girlfriend?

441
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:08,490
I don't know...

442
00:26:08,492 --> 00:26:09,758
but I went
to the computer lab

443
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,160
and found
the computer he was on.

444
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:12,228
And?

445
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,662
And I found the website
he was visiting,

446
00:26:13,664 --> 00:26:15,798
found his account username,
hacked in to the website,

447
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,466
found when else
this username logged in,

448
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:19,268
and then I reverse-tracked
the I.P. address

449
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,638
back to the original user,
Kevin,

450
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,140
who has apparently been using
the same wireless router

451
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:26,542
for the past two months.

452
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,244
That is
spectacular work.

453
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:31,047
Any chance I can get that
in English?

454
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:33,850
Yeah.
I think he's in Iowa --

455
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:35,652
at a coffee shop.

456
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:43,527
A church?
You sure this is right?

457
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:45,529
Barista at the coffee shop
swears he's seen Kevin

458
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:48,365
ducking in here
for the past few months.

459
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,243
Kevin.

460
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:02,246
It's Sam and Dean Winchester.
Open up.

461
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:16,394
Stop! Stop!

462
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:18,829
Not Leviathans.

463
00:27:18,831 --> 00:27:19,763
It's us.

464
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:20,998
What the hell
happened to you guys?

465
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,366
Cliff Notes?

466
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:25,635
I went to Purgatory.
Sam hit a dog.

467
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:26,936
For real?

468
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:31,006
You want some towels?

469
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,645
Who taught you
all this?

470
00:27:36,647 --> 00:27:38,747
I guess...God.

471
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:41,350
<i>God</i> taught you
how to trap demons?

472
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:42,885
Technically, yeah.

473
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:44,386
Wait, wait,
hold on.

474
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:47,155
Crowley kidnapped you.
I saw that.

475
00:27:47,157 --> 00:27:49,758
But then you left a message
saying you escaped.

476
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,059
How?

477
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,062
Well...

478
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:57,466
first, he took me
to a warehouse.

479
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:06,875
Look at you.

480
00:28:06,877 --> 00:28:09,277
Haircut,
manicure, pedicure.

481
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,912
Like a new penny.

482
00:28:10,914 --> 00:28:12,481
- Will there be torture now?
- Torture?

483
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,416
Heavens, no.

484
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:17,552
No. Quite the opposite,
my young prince.

485
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:21,857
Sky's the limit
for you and I.

486
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,061
There was
a tablet there,

487
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:27,363
like the last one.

488
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:29,965
There we go.

489
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:32,668
Now, remember --

490
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,605
feel like a winner,
be a winner.

491
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:36,873
Okay?

492
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,641
Interpret.

493
00:28:38,643 --> 00:28:40,710
Wait,
there's another tablet?

494
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:41,978
So another
word of God.

495
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,880
Yes.

496
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:45,115
How many words of God
are there?

497
00:28:45,117 --> 00:28:48,285
I just became a Prophet,
like, a year ago.

498
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,320
Well, did this tablet
have a name?

499
00:28:50,322 --> 00:28:51,454
"Demons."

500
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:53,256
What about demons?

501
00:28:53,258 --> 00:28:55,892
As far as
I could tell...

502
00:28:55,894 --> 00:28:57,327
everything.

503
00:28:57,329 --> 00:28:59,729
What are we looking at?

504
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:01,698
It's all
just fragments.

505
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,800
Bits and pieces.

506
00:29:03,802 --> 00:29:05,301
This is hard.

507
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:08,171
Throw me a bone here,
Kev.

508
00:29:08,173 --> 00:29:09,706
Wait...

509
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:12,008
Yes?

510
00:29:16,514 --> 00:29:17,447
I'm sorry.

511
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:18,881
Is it just me,
or is it hot in here?

512
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,183
Is it?

513
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:22,719
Our mistake.

514
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,926
Okay.
I see something.

515
00:29:29,928 --> 00:29:32,362
Hell Gates.

516
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:35,832
Talk to me.

517
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,600
What about
Hell Gates?

518
00:29:37,602 --> 00:29:39,402
There's one
in Wisconsin.

519
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,772
The tablet told me
how to open it.

520
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:45,376
There were ingredients
for a spell.

521
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,426
Right away.

522
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:05,062
Mr. Crowley
would like you to proceed.

523
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:06,396
Where is Mr. Crowley?

524
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:08,064
Where do you think, dumbass?
Wisconsin.

525
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:13,669
Go.

526
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,005
You showed the king of Hell
how to open a Hell Gate?

527
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:19,374
So that all the demons in Hell
could come out

528
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:20,542
all at the same time?

529
00:30:20,544 --> 00:30:21,576
What?

530
00:30:22,244 --> 00:30:23,478
No.

531
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:31,485
Men?

532
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:38,992
Kevin?

533
00:30:38,994 --> 00:30:41,462
Kevin?

534
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,431
I told Crowley
I was opening a Hell Gate,

535
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:47,268
but I was reading
from another chapter --

536
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,637
how to destroy demons.

537
00:30:51,507 --> 00:30:53,808
You son of a bitch.

538
00:30:54,543 --> 00:30:56,777
Wait. Kevin?

539
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:58,580
Where's
the tablet now?

540
00:30:58,582 --> 00:31:00,181
Safe.

541
00:31:00,183 --> 00:31:01,416
Safe where?

542
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:04,051
Hey. As long as
it's safe, okay?

543
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:06,754
Were you able to read
anything else off the tablet

544
00:31:06,756 --> 00:31:08,222
before
you stashed it?

545
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:10,825
Only the stuff about
closing the gates of Hell.

546
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,393
Forever.

547
00:31:12,395 --> 00:31:13,828
Come again?

548
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,197
Banish all demons
off the face of the Earth,

549
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:18,133
lock them away
forever.

550
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:19,935
That could be important,
right?

551
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:25,541
Closing
the gates of Hell forever?

552
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,048
Yeah. Yeah,
that could be important.

553
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,822
Okay, if this kid is right,
he's sitting on a bombshell.

554
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:50,324
Hell,
he <i>is</i> the bombshell.

555
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,926
What?

556
00:31:51,928 --> 00:31:53,761
That.

557
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:57,331
I mean, there's no way that Kevin's
getting out of this intact, is there?

558
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,900
Well, I think he's doing
pretty well for himself so far.

559
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:02,570
Yeah, he got out.

560
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:04,271
And now he's in it...

561
00:32:04,273 --> 00:32:07,174
whether
he likes it or not.

562
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:10,411
So...free will,
that's only for you?

563
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,482
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

564
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:18,052
Sam, we have an opportunity
to wipe the slate clean.

565
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:20,621
We take Kevin to the tablet,
he tells us the spell,

566
00:32:20,623 --> 00:32:24,792
we send every demon
back to hell -- forever.

567
00:32:24,794 --> 00:32:27,762
Every single bastard
that destroyed our lives,

568
00:32:27,764 --> 00:32:28,996
killed our mother,

569
00:32:28,998 --> 00:32:31,366
killed Jess.

570
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:32,834
And you're not sure?

571
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,720
Kevin, I, uh...

572
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,655
I owe you
an apology.

573
00:32:54,657 --> 00:32:55,957
Um...

574
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,225
look, when you disappeared
and Dean disappeared,

575
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:01,628
I...needed
to clear my head,

576
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:05,365
and...I'm thinking maybe
you were one of the pieces

577
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:08,935
that I should have been there
to pick up.

578
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:12,772
You've been a hunter
since you were a kid, right?

579
00:33:12,774 --> 00:33:16,075
Yeah, mostly.
Yeah.

580
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:20,546
Ever since I realized
I was a Prophet...

581
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:23,749
It's just hard to believe
this is actually my life.

582
00:33:26,753 --> 00:33:27,686
Yeah.

583
00:33:27,688 --> 00:33:29,721
It sucks right now.
I know that.

584
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:32,457
Um, it might suck
for a lot longer,

585
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:37,862
but...trust me on this --
it gets better.

586
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,066
You know I'm not gay,
right?

587
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,505
If we can do this,
get the tablet,

588
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:50,208
get you everything you need
to close the gates of Hell,

589
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,610
there's a world out there
where nobody --

590
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:56,881
not Crowley, no demon --
is chasing you anymore.

591
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,718
I guess I just don't see
how I get from here to there.

592
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,522
I used to not be able
to see it, either.

593
00:34:04,524 --> 00:34:06,524
But there is a way.

594
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:11,696
Just give me
5 minutes.

595
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,585
He's sustained
some serious internal bleeding.

596
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:34,453
There's at least
two leg fractures

597
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:35,755
that
I can see right now.

598
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:37,890
But with some TLC,
he should pull through for you.

599
00:34:39,961 --> 00:34:42,762
Thanks, Doctor.

600
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,530
You're gonna
take the dog?

601
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:49,536
Look, I-I would.
He's...not mine.

602
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:50,570
He's not anybody's.

603
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,574
I-I spend a lot of the time
on the road.

604
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:55,842
Don't you think
you're responsible?

605
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,112
Why do you think
I brought him here?

606
00:34:58,114 --> 00:35:00,347
Roberta, could you hand
this man his trophy

607
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:01,915
on his way out,
please?

608
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:04,051
Well, maybe if you were
such an upstanding guy,

609
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:06,353
you wouldn't have hit him
in the first place?

610
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,791
Fine.
I'll take him.

611
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:14,160
There's my hero.

612
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:34,281
We got company.

613
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:36,083
Sam.

614
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:46,458
What the hell
is that?

615
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,926
It's Purgatory.

616
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:52,330
Dean Winchester.
Back from Purgatory.

617
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:54,866
Spanky the demon.
Yeah, I heard about you.

618
00:35:54,868 --> 00:35:56,901
The one who uses
too much teeth, right?

619
00:36:24,864 --> 00:36:26,031
Dean!

620
00:36:36,676 --> 00:36:38,877
Hello, boys.

621
00:36:40,346 --> 00:36:41,880
Dean.

622
00:36:41,882 --> 00:36:45,216
You're looking...

623
00:36:45,218 --> 00:36:48,519
well, let's just say Purgatory
didn't do you any favors.

624
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:49,987
Where's your angel?

625
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:51,122
Ask your mother.

626
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:52,823
There's
that grade-school zip.

627
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:54,491
Missed it.
I really did.

628
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:56,827
Moose.

629
00:36:56,829 --> 00:36:58,228
Still
with the pork chops.

630
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,930
I admire that.

631
00:36:59,932 --> 00:37:00,798
Let Channing go.

632
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,799
That's not Channing,
Kevin.

633
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:02,800
Not anymore.

634
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:04,736
What an awful thing
to say to the boy.

635
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:06,237
Of course
it's Channing.

636
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,372
Kev.

637
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:09,641
Last time we danced,

638
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:12,477
you stole my tablet
and killed my men.

639
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:14,045
Tell you what.

640
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:17,182
Come with me now,
bygones.

641
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:22,487
And I'll let the girl go back
to...What's-the-Point U.

642
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:24,022
He's lying.

643
00:37:25,224 --> 00:37:27,192
You won't get Channing back.
She's probably dead already.

644
00:37:27,194 --> 00:37:29,828
Will you please
stop saying that?

645
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,598
Let the girl
speak.

646
00:37:35,702 --> 00:37:37,570
Kevin?
Channing?

647
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:38,837
What's
going on?

648
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,805
There's a demon in you,

649
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:41,106
and you're going
to your safety school.

650
00:37:41,108 --> 00:37:42,040
What?!

651
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:43,108
But it's gonna be
okay.

652
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,176
I-I-I-I just --
I can't.

653
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,144
No, no, wait.

654
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,484
Okay.

655
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:53,486
I'll do it.

656
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:54,120
Kevin.

657
00:37:54,122 --> 00:37:55,555
Myself for the girl.

658
00:37:55,557 --> 00:37:56,589
But this ends.

659
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:59,058
All right?
No fighting, no nothing.

660
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,293
It ends.

661
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:01,994
Can't let you do that,
buddy.

662
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:03,196
Or what?

663
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,631
You'll kill me?

664
00:38:07,669 --> 00:38:10,370
I'll grab my stuff.

665
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:14,040
Chin up, gentlemen.

666
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,174
I'm a professional.

667
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:16,943
This ain't over
by a long shot, Crowley.

668
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:19,345
Really, Dean, who writes
your stuff? A marshmallow?

669
00:38:20,814 --> 00:38:23,282
Come on, Kevin.

670
00:38:23,284 --> 00:38:25,451
Chop, chop.

671
00:38:28,322 --> 00:38:31,090
Kevin?

672
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:35,561
Aah!

673
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,064
Really, boys?

674
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:42,868
Kevin!

675
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:49,708
Kevin.

676
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:52,677
Sam, Dean, run!

677
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:02,220
Find
another meatsuit.

678
00:39:51,187 --> 00:39:53,354
Hello?

679
00:39:55,023 --> 00:39:56,257
Wrong number.

680
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:58,059
Automated jackass.

681
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,261
All right,
anybody want anything?

682
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:01,395
I'm good.

683
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:05,634
Kevin?

684
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,135
How
you holding up?

685
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:08,436
Awesome.

686
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:11,139
The king of Hell just
snapped my girlfriend's neck.

687
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:12,407
How 'bout you?

688
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:17,046
All right,
listen to me.

689
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:18,881
I'm sorry about your girlfriend,
okay? I am.

690
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,382
But the sooner you get this,
the better.

691
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,651
You're in it now
whether you like it or not.

692
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,253
That means
you do what you got to do.

693
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,488
I'm hitting the head.

694
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,976
There he is.

695
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:47,744
How did you
get a phone?

696
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,279
Would you believe
they sell these things

697
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:50,881
in convenience stores
now?

698
00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:52,883
A lot's changed
in 50 years.

699
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:55,485
Must be a hell of a lot
to take in.

700
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:57,955
Mostly it's the choices,
you know?

701
00:40:57,957 --> 00:41:00,524
So many choices.

702
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,060
Yeah, I hear that.

703
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:07,098
Listen, Benny,
not to beat a dead horse.

704
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,434
What we did down there
is what we had to do.

705
00:41:09,436 --> 00:41:12,470
Now, I don't regret it
for a second.

706
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:15,207
But...you know,
maybe until we both adjust,

707
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:17,543
it's best we don't talk
for a while.

708
00:41:17,545 --> 00:41:18,744
There it is.

709
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:20,846
One day at a time, just like
we talked about, right?

710
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:23,716
I think you had it right,
bud.

711
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:24,750
What's that?

712
00:41:24,752 --> 00:41:27,419
Purgatory <i>was</i> pure.

713
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:32,056
I'm kind of wishin'
I had appreciated it more.

714
00:41:32,058 --> 00:41:33,725
You know?

715
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:35,260
Like you.

716
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:41,732
Listen, you got an emergency,
you call me, you understand?

717
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:43,634
I hear you.

718
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:46,270
You keep your nose clean, too,
brother.

719
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,240
Yeah.
