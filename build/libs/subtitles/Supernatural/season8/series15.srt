<i>Marc oh don...</i>

<i>...Ki?r tolic</i>
<i>einder bolic.</i>

3
00:00:05,654 --> 00:00:06,819
Freaking witches!

4
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:10,189
I figured out
how to close the Gates of Hell.

5
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:13,743
God built a series of tests,
and when you've done all three,

6
00:00:13,745 --> 00:00:15,278
you can slam the gates.
All right. Where do we start?

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,165
You've got to kill a hound
of hell and bathe in its blood.

8
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:20,249
I need you to be safe.

9
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:22,251
So I'm gonna do
these trials.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,123
Aah!

11
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,591
Sam,
I didn't pass the test.

12
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:30,278
But <i>I</i> did, and I'm doing
the rest of them.

13
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:30,790
My ass you are!

14
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:34,047
I can do this.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,614
You were great, and I want to
give you a little something.

16
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,368
Here you go. Thanks.

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,986
Thank you.
Yeah.

18
00:01:36,644 --> 00:01:38,194
Guess it's not my night.

19
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:40,613
Guess not.

22
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:13,506
Wow.

23
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:14,957
You know, of all the lame-ass
things you've ever said,

24
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,759
that's got to be
the lame-assiest.

25
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,628
I'm sorry,
but I happen to think

26
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,763
Shemp was a funnier stooge
than Curly.

27
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:22,515
Curly was
a freaking genius!

28
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:24,300
I always found Curly's work
a bit obvious.

29
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:26,969
It's supposed to be obvious,
man. Tre stooges.

30
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:30,439
So, we calling James
tonight?

31
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:32,441
No.
I'll just call him tomorrow.

32
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:34,861
That drive was a bitch.

33
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:37,146
I wonder what he wanted.

34
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:38,865
Well, his text said
that he needed help.

35
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:40,700
He's a cop. I figured
it was work-related.

36
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:43,069
Yeah, well,
we do owe him.

37
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:46,122
The guy saved our lives <i>once,</i>
Sammy.

38
00:03:46,124 --> 00:03:48,324
I mean, it's not like the guy --
Saved our lives?

39
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,578
I'm gonna go for a beer run.
You need anything?

40
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,113
No, I'm good.

41
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:56,132
You sure?

42
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:57,950
Yeah.

43
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:01,170
'Cause you did just gank
a Hellhound,

44
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:03,339
which is no slice of pie,

45
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:07,476
and, uh, there is a mine field
of who knows what crap ahead.

46
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:10,763
Just want to make sure
that you are okay.

47
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:13,933
I'm good.

48
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:16,769
'Cause, you know, we could find
another devil dog.

49
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:17,820
You could tag out.

50
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,855
I could snuff
the son of a bitch.

51
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:24,443
Dean, Kevin doesn't even know
what the next trial is yet.

52
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:28,781
So whatever it is
you're worried about, stop.

53
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:29,999
I'll be ready.

54
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:13,359
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

55
00:05:14,712 --> 00:05:16,712
Uh...No. Um...

56
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:21,834
Hey.
You friendly?

57
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:24,253
Friendly. Good.
All right.

58
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,005
You're a pretty dog.

59
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:27,473
Oh, really?

60
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:30,259
You want, uh -- you want
a little belly scratch, huh?

61
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:32,561
So, who do you belong to?

62
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:33,646
Uh...

63
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,816
Right. No tags.

64
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:39,718
Uh,
what are you doing here?

65
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,156
Oh, no.

66
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:48,577
Hey!

67
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:51,230
Hey.

68
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:52,198
Okay, okay, okay.

69
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,699
Before you get pissed off,
look,

70
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,701
I-I just want you to know
this isn't my fault.

71
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:59,088
She just showed up at the door,
okay?

72
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,008
Didn't track in any mud.
Just wanted her belly scratched.

73
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,427
I-I figured
maybe she could stay tonight,

74
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:07,246
and we'd try
and find her a home tomorrow.

75
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:18,891
She can stay the night.

76
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:24,697
Two seconds ago,
she was a dog.

77
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,899
All right,
who the hell are you?

78
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:29,935
Not a shapeshifter,
so you can stash the blade.

79
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:33,205
I'm a familiar.

80
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:34,773
A what?

81
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:38,244
Companion to a witch --
some witches.

82
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:41,363
Split their time
between human and animal form.

83
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:45,034
I get a more accurate read
on people in my other persona.

84
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:48,054
Approaching guys in a motel room
like this --

85
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:50,172
well, it gets complicated.
Hmm.

86
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:53,509
My name's Portia.
I belong to James Frampton.

87
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,512
No. No, no.

88
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:57,963
See, that --
that doesn't work for us,

89
00:06:57,965 --> 00:07:01,317
'cause that would mean that
our buddy James is a witch.

90
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,153
Wow. You're quick.

91
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:06,405
James is a freaking witch?

92
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:07,540
He wasn't when you met him,

93
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,475
but that last case
you worked on with him --

94
00:07:09,477 --> 00:07:11,527
Uh, lunatic alchemist.
It was nasty.

95
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:14,780
James wanted to learn more
about that world --

96
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,532
the black arts, witchcraft.

97
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:18,984
It became the center
of his life.

98
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:21,620
Wait,
so you're telling me

99
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:25,875
that James the cop
became a witch because of us?

100
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:27,593
Unh-unh.

101
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:30,963
You don't like dogs,
do you?

102
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:34,600
Wait. So James
isn't a cop anymore?

103
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:35,851
Sure he is.

104
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:37,136
Homicide detective.

105
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:39,805
His new powers make his work
even better.

106
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,223
Then what does he need
from us?

107
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:43,359
Well, something's been happening
to him.

108
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:46,695
It started
with excruciating headaches,

109
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:50,682
screaming sounds in his ears,
horrible nightmares.

110
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:53,619
Unable to sleep or think.
He can't work.

111
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:56,405
It -- it's like he's having
a breakdown.

112
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:59,742
Maybe you can find a way
to help him.

113
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,463
Well, here's the thing.

114
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:08,250
Uh, witches --
not real fans.

115
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,587
Really?

116
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:14,089
Well, James is a cop
with a spotless record.

117
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,008
He's used his skills
for nothing but good.

118
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,394
So why don't you lose
the ignorant bigotry

119
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:21,880
for maybe two seconds
and give him a shot?

120
00:08:26,186 --> 00:08:28,604
That was incredibly hot.

121
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:32,942
It was pretty hot.

122
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:11,597
You might want to go easy
on that.

123
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:15,901
God, you look awful.

124
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:19,238
Not getting any better?

125
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,624
Worse.

126
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,942
I don't know
what's happening to me.

127
00:09:23,944 --> 00:09:28,998
These dreams
they're like, um --

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,766
like torture.

129
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:33,719
You didn't mention dreams.

130
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:38,340
Dark, bloody.

131
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:41,760
Spencer, they, uh --

132
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:44,880
they scare the hell
out of me.

133
00:09:44,882 --> 00:09:46,798
They're so real.

134
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,601
Just night after night.

135
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:49,852
Enough, James.

136
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,837
It's time to see someone.

137
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,939
Who?

138
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,277
Who do we see?

139
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,115
There's no medicine
for this.

140
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:07,503
Maybe you just need
time away.

141
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:11,156
It's way beyond that.

142
00:10:11,158 --> 00:10:17,930
James, it's too much --
all that you've taken on.

143
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:21,350
Not just the workload,
but the nature of the work.

144
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:23,135
Look around.

145
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:25,104
See a lot of cops, do you?

146
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:30,225
Life in this realm
is life on the fringe.

147
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:32,244
We don't fit.

148
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:39,401
How do you reconcile
what you are with what you do?

149
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:44,406
I don't know
where Portia is.

150
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:46,241
What?

151
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:49,495
She's gone.

152
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:53,865
I think
I'm pushing her away.

153
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,971
So, these dreams
James is having --

154
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:00,539
he thinks
that they're real?

155
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,541
He thinks that he is
actually killing people?

156
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:04,209
I think so.

157
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:07,479
At least that's what I picked up
before he started blocking me.

158
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:09,898
What does that mean,
blocking you?

159
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,234
Familiars
and their masters --

160
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:14,570
we can communicate
telepathically.

161
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,573
I can get inside of James' head
anytime I want.

162
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:19,074
But he shut me out.

163
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:21,026
So, what, you think
maybe there's something in there

164
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,411
he doesn't want you to see?

165
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:24,029
Possibly, yeah --

166
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,065
something dark, you know,
that's destroying him.

167
00:11:28,284 --> 00:11:31,103
He can't go to the police, and
he doesn't trust other witches.

168
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:32,888
But he trusts us?

169
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,923
You do know who we are,
right?

170
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:36,675
We're the last people
that somebody like James

171
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:38,394
needs to be telling
his troubles to.

172
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:41,764
This was my idea.

173
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,966
I was the one who sent you
the text under James' name.

174
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:45,551
He doesn't know you're here.

175
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:49,254
But...I think you're
maybe all he has.

176
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:13,829
Someone there?

177
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,402
You had no
right to do this.

178
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:29,239
I was afraid for your life!

179
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:33,026
My life is
none of their business!

180
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:47,791
Sam, Dean.

181
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:50,711
Witchcraft, James?
Really?

182
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,162
What the hell
are you thinking?

183
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:54,497
You come to help
or pile on?

184
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm just saying,
you screw with that stuff,

185
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:58,218
you're gonna fry
your wiring.

186
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,470
All right.

187
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:03,223
Look, why don't you tell us
about these dreams?

188
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:06,143
She said people were dying
in them.

189
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:08,729
"Dying"?

190
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:10,814
They were torn to bits.

191
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:14,835
I, uh, I could feel my fingers
ripping into their flesh.

192
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,203
But they <i>were</i> dreams?

193
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:19,456
Well, I, uh,
woke up in my bed.

194
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,342
Okay, so...Dreams?

195
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,027
I'm not so sure.

196
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:26,630
Not helping, James.

197
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:29,499
Those people --
they died.

198
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:32,836
I checked
with the precinct.

199
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:36,590
All right, well,
maybe you heard it,

200
00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:37,975
and it stuck in your head.

201
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:40,877
You're -- you don't think
I-I told myself all that?

202
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,647
You don't think I didn't say,
"that wasn't me.

203
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,216
I couldn't have done
such a thing"?

204
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:54,524
Is it yours?

205
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:59,413
James Martin Frampton.

206
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:07,871
What's happening to me?

207
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:09,623
Well, how about this?

208
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,575
Um, you pissed off
another witch,

209
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:16,296
and he or she hexed you
and forced you to...

210
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:20,517
It's possible, I suppose,
but I never heard of it.

211
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,469
How many of these dreams
have you had?

212
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:24,137
Four.

213
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,773
The most recent one
is last night.

214
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:29,726
Uh, it was a blind man.

215
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:31,695
I, uh...

216
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:34,931
I was choking him,
and, uh...

217
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,983
All right,
James, we're gonna --

218
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:38,602
we're gonna help you
figure this out,

219
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:40,153
but you're gonna have to
do your part.

220
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,789
Which is?

221
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:53,483
You're gonna have to
stay put.

222
00:14:58,623 --> 00:15:01,141
House arrest, my friend.

223
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:05,395
Got the last of it.

224
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:06,629
All right.

225
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:08,181
Well, I have been looking
at the crime-scene reports,

226
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:12,135
and they are exactly the same
as James told us --

227
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:13,904
vics, dates, location.

228
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:16,740
The most recent one was
a blind man, just like he said.

229
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:19,242
That's not good.

230
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:21,912
Also, I looked into his record
on the force.

231
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:25,198
He went from rookie detective to
lieutenant basically overnight,

232
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,750
and in the last four years,

233
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:29,986
his solve rate's been
right at about 100%.

234
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:31,221
Of course.

235
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,956
He's got the booga-booga
on his side.

236
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:37,094
Man, you know that
we've never actually seen

237
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:40,380
this witch-killing spell
of Bobby's work, right?

238
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:42,949
I mean,
this is not a sure thing.

239
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:46,503
Is anything we ever do
a sure thing?

240
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:48,939
Well, no,
but I would just like

241
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:52,576
to have the odds in our favor
as much as possible.

242
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:55,362
Right.

243
00:15:58,382 --> 00:16:00,217
Well, I'm concerned.

244
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:05,205
Concerned about the, uh --
the witch-killing spell...

245
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:08,492
...or that I'm gonna mess
these trials up?

246
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:15,081
Look, we get too far
down the road with this,

247
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,233
we can't go back,

248
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,920
And it'll be too late
for me to jump in.

249
00:16:19,922 --> 00:16:22,906
Who says
that you're gonna have to?

250
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:24,975
You know, maybe I'll
actually pull this one off.

251
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:26,143
I'm just saying.

252
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:28,025
I know what you're saying,
Dean. You've said it.

253
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:34,267
You know, I've been going
over this and over this,

254
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:36,886
asking myself
"why doesn't he trust me?"

255
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:38,572
And it occurred to me,
finally.

256
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:40,657
It's not
that you don't trust <i>me.</i>

257
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:43,693
It's that you
can only trust <i>you.</i>

258
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:47,414
Are you done?

259
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,032
Yeah,
I'm done if you're done.

260
00:16:53,037 --> 00:16:58,575
You know, once I get this
put together, we can't hesitate.

261
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:00,126
If we got to use it,
we use it.

262
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:03,547
You mean if we find the witch
that's doing this to James?

263
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:06,149
Or if there is
no other witch.

264
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:10,270
Or it wouldn't be the first
free pass we've given, Dean.

265
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:14,524
Look, I like James
as much as the next guy,

266
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:16,443
but people
are getting ganked here.

267
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:19,429
Besides, Benny, Kate --

268
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:21,815
they were forced to be
what they are.

269
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:23,316
James chose this.

270
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,537
Vics were all torn up
pretty bad.

271
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:30,707
Like someone shredded them
with their bare hands.

272
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:33,460
Like that could happen. Ed?

273
00:17:34,295 --> 00:17:36,913
Ed Stoltz.
He's lead on the case.

274
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:38,331
Special Agent Keith.

275
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,112
Josh here tells me
you don't have a lot to go on.

276
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:40,835
Yeah.

277
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:42,168
Isolated parts of the city,

278
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,337
vics who meant nothing
to nobody, so...

279
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:45,639
Right.

280
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:47,290
Well, uh, my partner and I had
a look at the crime scenes.

281
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,626
Things really must be slow
at the Bureau.

282
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:52,295
Locations have already been
knocked down.

283
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:55,282
Well, we did manage to find
this piece of fabric.

284
00:17:57,101 --> 00:17:59,936
Things get overlooked.
It happens.

285
00:17:59,938 --> 00:18:01,938
Why don't you run
the blood?

286
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,806
It could be the vic.
It could be the doers.

287
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:05,659
Let's see
if we get a match.

288
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,329
A witness did mention seeing
a man in a suit

289
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:11,364
and a white shirt
leaving the area, so --

290
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:13,366
You didn't mention a witness
in your report.

291
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:15,168
Anything else?

292
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,504
No.

293
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:19,339
We'll get back to you
on the lab work.

294
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:21,157
So if that's all --
Sure, but this witness --

295
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:23,660
That's all that was said,
Agent Keith.

296
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:26,829
We really don't have a lot here,
okay?

297
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,498
We'll be in touch.

298
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:46,349
Am I getting the stink eye
in here or what?

299
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,702
They can tell
you're an outsider.

300
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:50,070
Are they all witches?

301
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:51,955
And stuff.

302
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:54,908
But if there's information
out here about James,

303
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,242
they'll know.

304
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:00,330
How did James
find you, anyway?

305
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:02,465
Not the way it works.

306
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:06,136
The familiar finds the master,
and they become inseparable.

307
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:08,922
Guess a lot of people feel
that way about their pets.

308
00:19:10,308 --> 00:19:11,808
What?

309
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,060
I'm not James' pet.

310
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:17,063
Well, not all the time.

311
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:19,382
Not ever.

312
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:22,686
The master
and the familiar --

313
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:26,139
there's an unbreakable bond,
like a melding of souls.

314
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:28,525
We would die
for each other.

315
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:31,328
Portia.

316
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,363
Over here.

317
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:38,901
Dean,
meet Phillippe LeChat.

318
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,405
Dean's a wiccan
from Detroit.

319
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:43,590
Really?

320
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:46,626
Well...Sit, sit.

321
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:49,846
Spencer here?

322
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:51,631
Somewhere.

323
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,303
That's weird.
That only happens around cats.

324
00:19:57,305 --> 00:20:00,256
Tell me about James.

325
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:02,759
Lot of buzz out there.

326
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,978
All gossip.

327
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,431
The community has
a little attitude going.

328
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:11,885
He brings it on himself.

329
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:16,239
The whole cop thing --
witch cop -- is he nuts?

330
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:17,907
I said
the exact same thing.

331
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:20,627
Then there's you, babe.

332
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:25,448
It isn't done, Portia,
and you know it.

333
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:30,553
I'm sorry. Uh, remind me,
what -- what isn't done?

334
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:33,089
Portia.

335
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:37,427
Uh,
I'm a -- I'm a wiccan.

336
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:39,262
I'm from Detroit.

337
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:43,850
Spencer's
the man to ask.

338
00:20:43,852 --> 00:20:45,151
Oh, okay.

339
00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:47,520
Uh...
You ever heard of a-a spell

340
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:50,973
where a witch can control
the actions of another witch?

341
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:55,445
No, I never heard
of a thing like that.

342
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:58,531
I don't think
it's possible.

343
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,317
How's James?

344
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:04,370
Better.
I'll tell him you asked.

345
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:08,324
Philippe,
it's time we were going.

346
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:10,043
Of course.

347
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:11,461
Good night.

348
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,215
So nice to meet you.

349
00:21:30,064 --> 00:21:32,482
I knew it.

350
00:21:35,237 --> 00:21:37,620
Excuse me.

351
00:21:37,622 --> 00:21:38,788
Yeah.

352
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,123
Where are you?

353
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,658
Some witch bar. Why?

354
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,992
Listen,
I just got the lab work

355
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:44,544
back from the blood
on James' shirt.

356
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:45,912
And?
Not good.

357
00:21:45,914 --> 00:21:48,581
Blood's an exact match
to victim number three.

358
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,501
Well, that pretty much says
it all, doesn't it?

359
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:52,702
Yeah.

360
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:06,099
I hate doing this to you.

361
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,722
It's okay. Really.

362
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:15,358
We don't have to.

363
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,611
You know,
they won't find out.

364
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:20,663
Portia...

365
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:23,082
If I believe I'm innocent,

366
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:25,251
I have to do
the right thing.

367
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:31,424
And if I'm not innocent,
I have to do the right thing.

368
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:40,884
Tell me one day
this will be over.

369
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,894
I love you.

370
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:20,533
No!

371
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:21,901
No, Dean!

372
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:24,237
You have to listen to me,
please. It's not James.

373
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:41,010
Tonight,
James and I were close,

374
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:45,648
without psychological walls --
intimate.

375
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,900
I don't --

376
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:49,134
They had sex.

377
00:24:52,105 --> 00:24:53,472
Wow.

378
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:57,026
I, uh -- I didn't expect that.

379
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,144
We have
an unusual relationship.

380
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:02,164
Familiars aren't supposed to be
sexually involved

381
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,866
with their witches.

382
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:07,036
Understandable, you know,
considering that you're a...

383
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:11,791
...well,
and that he's...

384
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:13,376
That's --

385
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,678
Little help here?

386
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,047
No?

387
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,067
James and I --
we hadn't made love in weeks.

388
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:23,352
His agony ate him up,
and he shut me out.

389
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:27,890
But tonight,
I saw his thoughts --

390
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:29,225
memories of the murders.

391
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,976
I'm sorry,
is this you trying

392
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:33,178
to talk us out of ganking James
or --

393
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,531
Dean, that's all I saw --
just the kills.

394
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,733
No preparation,
no thought process,

395
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:40,186
no anticipation, no motive.

396
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:42,071
Just the kills
without context.

397
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,539
No other awareness
of the crimes?

398
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,624
No.

399
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:49,962
Doesn't that at least suggest
he's under another's control?

400
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:51,330
Spencer said
that wasn't possible.

401
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:54,300
He said
he'd never heard of it.

402
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,086
James is chained.

403
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,587
He's confined.

404
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:00,973
At least take a shot.

405
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:12,735
Gentlemen.

406
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,522
Still investigating
this crappy little case?

407
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:19,992
I'm awed the Bureau
has so much time on its hands.

408
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:23,162
Right. Well, we have some,
uh, individual discretion

409
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,580
to pursue cases.

410
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:25,714
I'll catch up later, Ed.

411
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:27,566
Yeah, but at some point,
cases like this go cold,

412
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:28,734
as I'm sure you're aware.

413
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,086
Just not enough to keep them
floating -- that's all.

414
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:33,622
Sure.
No new leads, then?

415
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:36,792
No. And it's drifting towards
the back burner, really.

416
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:38,194
We just don't have
the manpower.

417
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,179
Then it must have been tough
to lose a valuable resource

418
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,547
like Lieutenant Frampton.

419
00:26:43,683 --> 00:26:45,918
See,
he and I -- we, uh --

420
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,753
we caught a case together
a while back.

421
00:26:47,755 --> 00:26:49,755
Well,
he's not lost to me.

422
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:51,106
He's -- he's on leave.

423
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:53,943
I remember he said he was
the youngest guy here

424
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,344
to ever make lieutenant.

425
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,013
Must have made a few waves.

426
00:26:58,015 --> 00:27:01,400
Nah. This place is run
like a dogsled --

427
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:02,768
no stars. Just grunts.

428
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:03,903
One mutt goes lame,

429
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:06,956
another one pops up
and slogs through the slush.

430
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,824
Agent.

431
00:27:35,469 --> 00:27:38,153
So this, uh, warlock
we're meeting --

432
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:39,972
he's --
he's a snitch?

433
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:42,975
Cops have snitches
all over town.

434
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:45,310
James uses Drexyl
when he suspects someone

435
00:27:45,312 --> 00:27:46,495
in the community.

436
00:27:52,953 --> 00:27:54,653
I got to ask.

437
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:56,171
I-I can't help
but wonder --

438
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:58,707
Which came first,
dog or girl?

439
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:01,143
Yeah.

440
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:02,795
Yeah, I mean,
I'm just curious

441
00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:05,297
as to which one
you consider yourself, mostly.

442
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:08,267
This have anything to do

443
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,319
with what I told you
about James and me last night?

444
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:14,473
How you're imagining it?

445
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:17,676
What?

446
00:28:17,678 --> 00:28:20,012
No, that's...

447
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:21,013
Yes.

448
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:39,214
Drexyl, this is Dean.

449
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:41,750
Wiccan, Detroit.
I heard.

450
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:45,871
So, here's the deal --
absolutely no word on the street

451
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:47,890
about any witch
hexing another one.

452
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,009
You sure there's
not any kind of spell?

453
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:53,545
Look, Detroit, I pride myself
on reliable sourcing.

454
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:57,483
There is, however, a lot
of chatter about our James.

455
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,751
What kind of chatter?

456
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:00,218
That he's gone ripper.

457
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,438
As in Jack the --

458
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,557
Someone's circulating the rumor
that he's set at full kill.

459
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,610
"Someone"? One of us?

460
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:10,029
If the cops get wind of it,
arrest James,

461
00:29:10,031 --> 00:29:13,015
find out what he really is,
that exposes the rest of us.

462
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,084
You know
that can't happen.

463
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,336
Meaning?

464
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,338
They're gonna give James
two choices --

465
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,591
leave
or the full hara-kiri.

466
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:24,760
Suicide?

467
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:27,179
Witches appreciate
a grand gesture.

468
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:28,914
I won't let him do that.

469
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:31,083
Well, the community might do it
for him.

470
00:29:42,763 --> 00:29:44,363
Hey.
Hey.

471
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,766
So, I have been going over
Bobby's data.

472
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:49,568
Anything?

473
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,036
Uh,
Portia might not be wrong.

474
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:53,155
Turns out there is
a spell for, uh --

475
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:56,041
for implanting images
into another person's brain.

476
00:29:56,043 --> 00:29:57,710
Really?
Yeah.

477
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:02,464
Uh, "Creating false memories
into another witch's mind."

478
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:04,416
Wow.

479
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:07,052
So James could be convinced
he killed those other people

480
00:30:07,054 --> 00:30:08,170
without ever touching them.

481
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:09,922
So, then,
maybe it <i>is</i> somebody else.

482
00:30:09,924 --> 00:30:10,894
Yeah, who's going to a
hell of a lot of trouble

483
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:11,975
to make it look like James.

484
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,976
What'd the cops say?

485
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,060
Here's the thing.

486
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:17,062
Um, according to Ed Stoltz,
they got zip,

487
00:30:17,064 --> 00:30:18,263
but they got something.

488
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:20,265
I saw the, uh, tech guy
who's working the case,

489
00:30:20,267 --> 00:30:22,901
and he had a huge file folder
marked "James Frampton""

490
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:25,170
Ed didn't mention that.

491
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:27,305
No, he did not.

492
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:28,824
All right.

493
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:31,660
Oh, by the way,
got to hand it to you.

494
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:34,813
It's been 15 hours since Portia
mentioned her night with James,

495
00:30:34,815 --> 00:30:37,149
and not one bestiality joke
out of you.

496
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:47,092
Portia tells me
my friends in the community

497
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:48,761
want me burned at the stake.

498
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,046
I'm not gonna lie.
It's, uh -- it's getting ugly.

499
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:53,716
Yeah, the cops may have more
on the case than they're saying,

500
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,333
including a thick dossier
on you.

501
00:30:55,335 --> 00:30:57,169
Me?
Yeah.

502
00:30:57,171 --> 00:31:00,189
I get the feeling whatever they
have is under lock and key

503
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,858
at the precinct,
uh, room C-110.

504
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,509
Then we need to break in.

505
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:06,228
Sure, yeah.

506
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,363
A locked room in a joint
crawling with cops 24/7 --

507
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:09,782
why didn't I think of that?

508
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:14,369
Dean, a witch can go to a place
without having to go to a place.

509
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:17,039
What, like phone sex?

510
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,824
Astral projection.

511
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:21,243
I can project my awareness
anywhere...

512
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:23,128
Ohh.

513
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,297
...from the comfort
of right here.

514
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:26,698
But these have got to go.

515
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,133
Not gonna happen.

516
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:29,718
Irons on, no magic.

517
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,536
No magic, no break-in.

518
00:31:32,973 --> 00:31:35,174
Okay.

519
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:37,226
But only if we can go
with you.

520
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:49,938
James, are you sure you're
still even able to do this?

521
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,608
Oh, well,
that's a confidence builder.

522
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,159
Anything else I should know

523
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:56,895
before I become some disembodied
thing, completely at his mercy?

524
00:31:56,897 --> 00:31:58,080
Just close your eyes.

525
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,400
Whatever I see,
I'll pass on to you, too.

526
00:32:02,402 --> 00:32:06,872
<i>Libera me occulta</i>
<i>cognoscere veritatem.</i>

527
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,185
James, why don't you give us
a little warning

528
00:33:10,187 --> 00:33:11,486
you're gonna snap us back
like that?

529
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:15,107
Stoltz --
he's building a case against me.

530
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:16,158
What?!

531
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,479
Ed -- he's always wanted
a breakthrough case.

532
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:25,083
Nailing a renegade cop --
that would qualify.

533
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:28,837
Yeah, especially one he holds
a grudge against.

534
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:32,824
My first case -- they dropped
him as lead detective.

535
00:33:32,826 --> 00:33:34,259
They went with me.

536
00:33:34,261 --> 00:33:37,713
So what is this, you think --
a payback?

537
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,048
He can't just arrest you.

538
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,833
He needs evidence.
He needs proof.

539
00:33:41,835 --> 00:33:43,151
He's got it!

540
00:33:43,153 --> 00:33:44,553
He's got everything.

541
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,355
From who?

542
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,840
Phil. The cat.

543
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:51,526
Philippe.

544
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,479
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.

545
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:56,031
James, hey.
Talk this out, buddy.

546
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:04,373
James, don't!
We'll do this together.

547
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,691
No, we won't.
It's not safe for you.

548
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:08,160
Our time together is over.

549
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:10,662
Standing by you is my duty,
my choice!

550
00:34:10,664 --> 00:34:12,915
Portia, the ceiling
is coming down on me.

551
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,049
You still have a life.

552
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,250
Please.

553
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:17,369
Portia, go.

554
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:18,870
James --

555
00:34:18,872 --> 00:34:21,006
Go!

556
00:34:28,097 --> 00:34:31,566
So, you don't think it's
too late for me to wear braces?

557
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:32,651
Won't even notice them.

558
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,519
We'll put in transparent.

559
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:43,278
James, what are you doing?

560
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,113
Why are you telling lies
about me?

561
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:46,448
I'm not. I wouldn't.

562
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,016
I saw the evidence room.

563
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:51,620
I saw the police sketch based
on an eyewitness account.

564
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,957
Get lost.

565
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:58,677
Please, don't.

566
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,728
Tell me why.

567
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,647
I had no choice.

568
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:03,298
What does that mean?

569
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,268
My master made me.

570
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,803
Liar.

571
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:11,189
You're a coward and a liar.
Spencer's my friend.

572
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:12,424
A direct command.

573
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:16,645
Please,
don't hurt my face.

574
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:20,399
I'm not interested --

575
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:26,455
He was always spineless.

576
00:35:27,874 --> 00:35:30,208
Now literally.

577
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,359
It was you.

578
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:46,736
You were behind all this?

579
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:51,524
I humbly accept credit.

580
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,727
You made me think
I was a killer.

581
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,916
Ed Stoltz
put you up to it.

582
00:35:59,918 --> 00:36:03,753
He found out you were a witch,
tried to blackmail you.

583
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,707
You're not using
your thinking cap, Jimmy.

584
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:10,794
It was actually crucial that he
didn't believe in the occult.

585
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:14,097
I'd say he's built
quite a solid case, don't you?

586
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,516
I don't understand.

587
00:36:16,518 --> 00:36:18,635
Of course you don't.

588
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:21,420
Neither of you ever considered
<i>my</i> feelings.

589
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:24,808
Portia?

590
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:30,313
This is about her?

591
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:35,652
Can you imagine the insult
when she chose you?

592
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:38,872
I wanted her as my soul mate
the moment I saw her.

593
00:36:38,874 --> 00:36:42,125
She was meant to be
my familiar.

594
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:46,112
Oh, she's way more
than familiar, isn't she?

595
00:36:46,114 --> 00:36:49,332
When she picked you as master,
I endured it.

596
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,885
But when you two went
all Bella and Edward,

597
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:53,002
broke the code,

598
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:55,454
put your passions
before the community rules,

599
00:36:55,456 --> 00:37:01,845
well, the arrogance,
the entitlement was too much.

600
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:04,831
Your total ruination
seemed appropriate.

601
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:10,019
The wiccan from Detroit.

602
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:11,354
So James didn't kill
those --

603
00:37:20,648 --> 00:37:24,817
Seriously,
you want to take me on?

604
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,828
Hurry.

605
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,335
It's not only James' head
I can get inside.

606
00:37:47,651 --> 00:37:49,895
Dean.

607
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:02,989
Sam!

608
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,090
Ego voco impetu delere...

609
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,543
...vos caelum et infernum.

610
00:38:48,902 --> 00:38:51,421
Well, kids,
don't try this at home.

611
00:39:02,794 --> 00:39:05,445
You sure you don't want to stay
and fight this?

612
00:39:05,447 --> 00:39:07,180
Look,
we can help you.

613
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:08,982
Eh,
Spencer was right.

614
00:39:08,984 --> 00:39:11,668
Ed Stoltz has built

615
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,003
enough of a case
against me

616
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:15,155
to make life hell
for a long time,

617
00:39:15,157 --> 00:39:19,793
and the community here
wants no part of us.

618
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,779
We start over.

619
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:24,047
We're used to it.

620
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:28,668
It's the way it's always been,
for all of us.

621
00:39:30,238 --> 00:39:32,021
I'll miss you.

622
00:39:33,524 --> 00:39:36,176
Maybe even you.

623
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:39,062
I like dogs.

624
00:39:39,064 --> 00:39:42,416
No. You really don't.

625
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:12,896
Well,
it's possible I was wrong.

626
00:40:12,898 --> 00:40:14,281
What, about James?

627
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:16,416
Dude, we were both ready
to gank the guy.

628
00:40:16,418 --> 00:40:19,753
No,
that's not what I meant.

629
00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:25,342
Back there,
when Spencer had us.

630
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,928
He screwed with my head.

631
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,464
I saw mom...

632
00:40:30,466 --> 00:40:34,151
When she died...

633
00:40:34,153 --> 00:40:36,186
And then some other crap.

634
00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:39,890
Yeah. Me, too.

635
00:40:42,126 --> 00:40:44,861
You know, when I look back at
what our family's been through,

636
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:47,230
what everybody's
been through,

637
00:40:47,232 --> 00:40:51,902
seeing all that pain...

638
00:40:51,904 --> 00:40:54,404
I realize that the only way
we've made it through it all

639
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:56,439
is by hanging together.

640
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:03,914
I trust you, Sammy.

641
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:09,219
With this deal,
locking those sons of bitches up

642
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:10,687
in the furnace
once and for all,

643
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:11,972
it's too important not to.

644
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:17,594
So if you say you're good...

645
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:20,147
...then that's it.

646
00:41:20,149 --> 00:41:22,182
I'm with you 100%.

647
00:41:29,575 --> 00:41:30,941
I'm good.
