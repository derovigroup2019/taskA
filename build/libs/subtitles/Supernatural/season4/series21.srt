1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,673
Lilith is trying to break
the 66 seals to free Lucifer from hell.

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,176
- Lucifer will bring the apocalypse.
Mom.

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,679
- Sam, I'm sorry.
- For what?

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,723
Does this mean
I have demon blood in me?

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,559
I don't wanna be the freak for once,
Dean.

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,977
I wanna be normal.

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,063
Your brother is headed down
a dangerous road, Dean.

8
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,066
Do you even know how far off
the reservation you've gone?

9
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,027
How far from normal? From human?

10
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,195
If I didn't know you,
I'd wanna hunt you.

11
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,740
You wanna know
if I know about the demon blood.

12
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,075
You didn't tell Dean?
Where are you, Ruby?

13
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,620
I'm all out. Call me. I need more.

14
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,290
This is for your own good.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,084
Guys?

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,756
Hey, hey. What-?
This isn't funny. Hey!

17
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,569
Okay. Let me out. This is not funny.

18
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,904
Damn straight.

19
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,906
Dean, come on.

20
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,657
- This is crazy.
No.

21
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,076
Not until you dry out.

22
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,748
Look, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have lied to you.

23
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,835
- Just open the door.
- You don't have to apologize.

24
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,170
It's not your fault.

25
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:32,883
It's not your fault that you lied to me
over and over again.

26
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,928
- I get it now. You couldn't help it.
- I'm not some junkie.

27
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,640
Really? I guess I've just imagined
how strung out you've been lately.

28
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,352
You're trying to twist this...

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,896
...into some kind of ridiculous
drug intervention?

30
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,481
If it smells like a duck.

31
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,776
Dean, I'm not drinking
the demon blood for kicks.

32
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,153
I'm getting strong enough to kill Lilith.

33
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,863
- Strong?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,033
This is about as far away from strong
as you can get. Try weak.

35
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,993
Try desperate. Pathetic.

36
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,412
Killing Lilith...

37
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,206
...is what matters.

38
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,961
Or are you so busy being self-righteous
you forgot about her?

39
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,131
Oh, Lilith's gonna die.

40
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,300
Bobby and I will kill her,
but not with you.

41
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,302
- You're not serious.
- Congrats, Sammy.

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,556
You just bought yourself
a benchwarmer seat to the apocalypse.

43
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,183
Dean, look- No, wait-

44
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,810
Come back here.

45
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,771
Dean!

46
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,981
Let me out of here!

47
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,984
Dean!

48
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,194
Let me out of here!

49
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,657
Let me out!

50
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,701
Dean!

51
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:39,551
Guys, get down here!
Something's coming!

52
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,304
Hello, Sam.

53
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,767
It's a pleasure to see you again.

54
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,145
Looks like I have you
all to myself here.

55
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,813
Goodness.

56
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,485
How will we pass the time?

57
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,997
Don't. No, no, don't. Don't, don't.

58
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,999
No-

59
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,173
Stop! Stop!

60
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,426
Alastair, unh...

61
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,844
...please.

62
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,638
Please.

63
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,266
So polite all of a sudden.

64
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,645
Very nice.

65
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,774
I appreciate that.

66
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,656
No. Alastair, please. No, no-

67
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,454
No. No.

68
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,417
God, no!

69
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,753
Please! Please, please.

70
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,715
God!

71
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,970
Stop! Stop!

72
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,974
How long is this gonna go on?

73
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,395
Here, let me look it up
in my demon-detox manual.

74
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,107
Oh, wait. No one ever wrote one.

75
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,945
No telling how long it'll take.

76
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,198
Hell, or if Sam will even
live through it.

77
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,082
Hello.

78
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,795
Suck dirt and die, Rufus.
You call me again, I'll kill you.

79
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,883
- What's up with Rufus?
- He knows.

80
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,850
I'm busy, you son of a bitch.
This better be important.

81
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,081
The answer's yes.

82
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,375
You're hallucinating.

83
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,754
That's right, it's me.

84
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,925
Or I mean, it's you.

85
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,137
- I'm losing my mind.
- Definitely.

86
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,975
- What do you want?
- An explanation.

87
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,728
How could you do this to me?

88
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,855
I thought we were gonna be normal.

89
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,942
I tried. I did.

90
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,445
It didn't pan out that way.

91
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,822
Sorry, kid.

92
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,282
"Sorry, kid"?

93
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,159
That's what you have to say?

94
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,829
It's all we ever wanted.

95
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,163
We were so close.

96
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,082
You got away from Dad.

97
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,168
You quit hunting, you were gonna
become a lawyer and get married.

98
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,129
- Why'd you blow it?
- Look.

99
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,132
They killed Jessica.

100
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,176
Yeah.
And if you hadn't run off with Dean...

101
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,763
...if you'd been there to protect her,
she'd still be alive.

102
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,224
- I know.
- You think Jess...

103
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,351
...would want you to turn into this?

104
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,311
She loved you.

105
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,107
You think she'd be happy
you using her as an excuse?

106
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,608
I'm sorry...

107
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,152
...I am...

108
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,322
...but life doesn't turn out the way you
thought when you were 14 years old.

109
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,534
We were never gonna be normal.
We were never gonna get away.

110
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,995
Grow up.

111
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,374
Maybe you're right.

112
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,628
Maybe there's no escape.

113
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,755
After all...

114
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,259
...how can you run
from what's inside you?

115
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,262
The news.

116
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,556
The news ain't good.

117
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,976
This is what Rufus called about?

118
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,229
"Key West sees
10 species go extinct. "

119
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,440
Yep. Plus Alaska.

120
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,486
Fifteen-man fishing crew
all stricken blind, cause unknown.

121
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:12,324
New York, teacher goes postal,
locks the door, kills exactly 66 kids.

122
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,910
All this in a single day.

123
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,871
I looked them up.
There's no doubt about it.

124
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,164
They're all seals.

125
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,082
Breaking, fast.

126
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:26,796
- How many are left?
- Who knows? Can't be many.

127
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,674
Where the hell are your angel pals?

128
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,218
You tell me.

129
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,431
I'm just wondering.

130
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,642
What?

131
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,771
The apocalypse being nigh and all...

132
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:47,234
...is now really the right time to be
having this little domestic drama of ours?

133
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,027
What do you mean?

134
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,280
Well, I don't like this any more
than you do...

135
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,949
...but Sam can kill demons.

136
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,284
He's got a shot
at stopping Armageddon.

137
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,577
So what?

138
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,371
Sacrifice Sam's life...

139
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,707
...his soul, for the greater good?
Is that what you're saying?

140
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,002
Times are bad,
so let's use Sam as a nuclear warhead?

141
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,921
Look...

142
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,384
...I know you hate me for suggesting it.
I hate me for suggesting it.

143
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,094
I love that boy like a son.

144
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,513
All I'm saying...

145
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,682
...is maybe he's here right now...

146
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:22,644
...instead of on the battlefield
because we love him too much.

147
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,389
Poor baby.

148
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,268
Mom.

149
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,228
Sam.

150
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,691
You look just awful.

151
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,282
Let's hear it.

152
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,827
- Go ahead.
- What do you mean?

153
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,124
You're disappointed.

154
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,960
You never thought...

155
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,962
...I'd turn out this way.

156
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,006
I'm...

157
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,509
...a piss-poor excuse for a son.

158
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,972
Your heart is broken.

159
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,851
Am I close?

160
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,395
Not at all.

161
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,440
You're doing the right thing, Sam.

162
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,903
What you're doing is brave.

163
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,740
You're not being crazy,
you're being practical.

164
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,537
Sam, I am so proud of you.

165
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,334
But-

166
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,297
- But Dean-
- Your brother doesn't understand.

167
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,096
I was raised a hunter from a long line.

168
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,766
We understand
that there are gonna be hard choices.

169
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,520
And we do what we have to
to get the job done.

170
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,024
Yes, our family is cursed.

171
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,820
But you-

172
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,698
You have the power
to turn it into a gift.

173
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,326
You can use it against them.

174
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,453
For revenge?

175
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,747
No, for justice.

176
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,211
I know how scared you are.

177
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,591
What's...

178
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,344
...in me...

179
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,055
...Mom...

180
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,974
- ... it's-
- Evil.

181
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,226
And you know it.

182
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,522
What if it's stronger than me?

183
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,608
Look at me.

184
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,403
What if Dean's right?

185
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,575
Dean can never know
how strong you are...

186
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,245
...because Dean is weak.

187
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,124
Look at what he's done to you.

188
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,500
Locking you in here?

189
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,753
He's terrified.

190
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,297
He's in over his head.

191
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,967
You have to go on without him.

192
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,470
You have what it takes.

193
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:49,392
- You have to kill Lilith.
- Even if it kills me.

194
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,858
Make my death mean something.

195
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,736
I'm counting on you, Sam.

196
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,782
Don't let anyone or anything
get in your way.

197
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,159
Not even Dean.

198
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,739
Well, it's about time.

199
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,117
I've been screaming myself hoarse
for two and a half hours now.

200
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,078
What do you want?

201
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,248
You can start with what happened
in Illinois.

202
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,124
What do you mean?

203
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,710
Cut the crap.
You were gonna tell me something.

204
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,462
Well, nothing of import.

205
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,633
You got ass-reamed in heaven
but it was not of import?

206
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,386
Dean, I can't.

207
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,806
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:17,146
Get to the reason you really called me.
It's about Sam, right?

209
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,859
Can he do it?

210
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,361
Kill Lilith, stop the apocalypse?

211
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,905
Possibly, yes.

212
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,950
But as you know...

213
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,078
...he'd have to take certain steps.

214
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,873
Crank up the hell-blood regimen.

215
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,334
Consuming the amount it would take
to kill Lilith...

216
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,962
...would change your brother forever.

217
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,590
Most likely,
he would become the next creature...

218
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,717
...that you would feel compelled
to kill.

219
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,598
There's no reason
this would have to come to pass, Dean.

220
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,435
We believe it's you, Dean.

221
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,562
Not your brother.

222
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,067
The only question for us
is whether you're willing to accept it.

223
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,739
Stand up and accept your role.

224
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,783
You are the one who will stop it.

225
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,334
If I do this...

226
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,878
...Sammy doesn't have to?

227
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,382
If it gives you comfort
to see it that way.

228
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,596
God, you're a dick these days.

229
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,650
Fine, I'm in.

230
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:50,156
You give yourself over wholly
to the service of God and his angels?

231
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,200
Yeah, exactly.

232
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,035
Say it.

233
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,879
I give myself over wholly...

234
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,631
...to serve God...

235
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,384
...and you guys.

236
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,095
You swear to follow his will
and his word...

237
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,264
...as swiftly and obediently
as you did your own father's?

238
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,728
Yes, I swear.

239
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,691
Now what?

240
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,860
Now you wait...

241
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,155
...and we call on you when it's time.

242
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,741
Guys! Help!

243
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,955
Bobby! Dean! Help!

244
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,960
Hey! Hey! Guys!

245
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,755
Guys, help! Dean!

246
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,923
Correct me if I'm wrong...

247
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,135
...but you willingly signed up
to be the angels' bitch?

248
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,805
I'm sorry. You prefer "sucker"?

249
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,809
After everything you said about them,
now you trust them?

250
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,771
Come on, give me a little credit,
Bobby.

251
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,689
I've never trusted them less.

252
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,859
I mean, they come on
like shady politicians from planet Vulcan.

253
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,112
- Then why in the hell-?
- Because what other option do I have?

254
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,199
It's either trust the angels
or let Sammy trust a demon?

255
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,620
I see your point.

256
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,709
You hear that?

257
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,672
Yeah, that's a little too much nothing.

258
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,357
- What if he's faking?
- You really think he would?

259
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,735
I think he'd do anything.

260
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,363
That ain't faking.

261
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,971
We're gonna have to tie him down
for his own safety.

262
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,557
Dean? You with me?

263
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,397
- Dean! Before he has another fit.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's just get it over with.

264
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,082
We had to.

265
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,377
The demon blood was flinging you
all over the room.

266
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,922
Tell me something, Sam.
Why did you do this to yourself?

267
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,552
You know why.

268
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,888
Right.

269
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,764
"Kill Lilith. " The big excuse.

270
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,643
But why?

271
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,938
What, revenge? Right?

272
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,273
Of course.

273
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,568
Revenge for what?
For sending me to hell?

274
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:59,280
Did you happen to notice I'm back?
Alive and kicking.

275
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,825
- So, what's the point?
- Point?

276
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,622
How about
"stop the damn apocalypse"?

277
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,916
My gig. Not yours.

278
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,626
The angels said so, remember?

279
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,546
God picked me, man.

280
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,842
So you got any other fantastic excuses?

281
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,177
Hmm?

282
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,436
I'm gonna ask one more time.

283
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,314
Are we absolutely sure
we're doing the right thing?

284
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,525
Bobby, you saw
what was happening to him there.

285
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,111
The demon blood is killing him.

286
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,780
No, it isn't.

287
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,448
- We are.
- What?

288
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,368
I'm sorry.
I can't bite my tongue any longer.

289
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,702
We're killing him.

290
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,373
Keeping him locked up down there.
This cold-turkey thing isn't working.

291
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:55,336
If- If he doesn't get
what he needs soon...

292
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,338
...Sam's not gonna last much longer.

293
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,220
No.

294
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,181
I'm not giving him demon blood.
I won't do it.

295
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:11,102
- And if he dies?
- Then at least he dies human.

296
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,148
I know why you really drink that blood,
Sam.

297
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,402
Just leave me alone.

298
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,905
Makes you feel strong.

299
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,532
Invincible.

300
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,868
- A big, bad wolf in a world of little pigs.
- No.

301
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,495
You're wrong, Dean.

302
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,039
It's more than that, isn't it?

303
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,043
It's because your whole life,
you felt different.

304
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,837
Am I right?

305
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,672
Stop.

306
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,341
Oh, I hit a little close to home, huh?

307
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,680
Not different
because you were some lonely kid...

308
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,641
- ... or because of your weirdo family.
- Stop it.

309
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,232
- Because you're a monster.
- Shut up!

310
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,738
- Just- Unh. Shut the hell up.
- You were always a monster.

311
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,240
And you only feel right...

312
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:10,911
...when you're sucking down
more poison and more evil.

313
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,248
I would die for him in a second...

314
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,919
...but I won't let him do this
to himself.

315
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,213
I can't.

316
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,259
I guess I found my line.

317
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,722
I won't let my brother
turn into a monster.

318
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,433
Monster, Sam. You're a monster.

319
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,478
- Dean, no.
- And I tried so hard to pretend...

320
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,937
...that we were brothers.

321
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,941
That you weren't one of the filthy things
that we hunt.

322
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,611
But we're not even the same species.

323
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,989
- You're nothing to me.
- Don't say that to me.

324
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,076
Don't you say that to me.

325
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,008
Hello?

326
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,699
Someone here?

327
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,354
What did you do?

328
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,858
- You shouldn't have come, Anna.
- Why would you let out Sam Winchester?

329
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,445
- Those were my orders.
- Orders?

330
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,616
Cass, you saw him.

331
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,619
He's drinking demon blood.

332
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,621
It's so much worse than we thought.

333
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,249
Dean was trying to stop him.

334
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,294
You really shouldn't have come.

335
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,129
Uh-uh, Sam.

336
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,049
The only place you're going
is back inside with me.

337
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,513
No.

338
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,807
Damn it, boy.

339
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,687
You won't shoot me, Bobby.

340
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,024
Don't test me.

341
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,944
You won't do it.

342
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,537
You can't do it.

343
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,171
We're trying to help you, Sam.

344
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,890
Then shoot.

345
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,895
How the hell did he get out?

346
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,273
Maybe he had help.

347
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,401
Room full of busted devil's traps.

348
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,237
Demons?

349
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,280
- Ruby.
- That'd be my guess.

350
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,450
How did she even touch the door?

351
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,745
- You think she's got the mojo?
- I didn't think so.

352
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,545
- I don't know, man.
- What difference does it make?

353
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,464
How he got gone ain't as important
as where he got gone to.

354
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,467
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
I hope he's with Ruby.

355
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,052
Why?

356
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,430
Killing her's the next item
on my to-do list.

357
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,724
I thought you were on call
for angel duty.

358
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,810
I am on call in my car,
on my way to murder the bitch.

359
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,438
- One thing.
- What?

360
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,606
Sam don't wanna be found...

361
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:58,694
...which means he's gonna be
damn near impossible to find.

362
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,989
Yeah, we'll see.

363
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,852
Honeymoon suite, really?
I'm flattered.

364
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,607
- Did you bust me out of that room?
- How could I, Sam?

365
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,860
The whole thing's engineered
to bite me in the ass.

366
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,654
Then how did I get out of there?

367
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,698
I don't know. I don't wanna know.

368
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,991
You're out.

369
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,618
That's all that matters.

370
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,787
I'm glad you're here.

371
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,371
Yeah?

372
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,041
- Where have you been?
- Got here as quick as I could.

373
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,542
I mean the past three weeks.

374
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,378
- I've been calling.
- I've been trying to dig out Lilith.

375
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,465
Sometimes I can't sit around
and check my voicemail.

376
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,885
I'm sorry you're hurting.

377
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,304
Really.

378
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,265
I had no idea
that Dean would do that to you.

379
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,478
You and me both.

380
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,400
You didn't book this joint
just to impress me, did you?

381
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,902
Dean's gonna come after me.

382
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,488
And he knows my habits...

383
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,908
...my aliases, everything.

384
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,993
He knows exactly
which motel I'd pick.

385
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,412
Hence the room.

386
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,666
Whatever it takes to shake him.

387
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,586
It won't be easy. I mean,
he knows you better than anyone.

388
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,549
Not as well as he thinks.

389
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,509
You know, it's sad.

390
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,679
What?

391
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,349
That things have gotten this bad
between you two.

392
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,644
Police found my car.

393
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,564
Abandoned in an alley
in Jamestown, North Dakota.

394
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,318
He's switching up.
Any other cars stolen in Jamestown?

395
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,821
Two. 1999 Honda Civic, blue.

396
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,325
- Nice and anonymous, like Sam likes.
- What was the other one?

397
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,162
White '05 Escalade with custom rims.

398
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,999
- It's a neon sign.
- You're right. He'd never take that.

399
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,834
Which is exactly what he did.

400
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,503
You think?

401
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,631
I know that kid.

402
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,591
I'll head in that direction.

403
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,469
You stay here,
ride the police databases.

404
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,681
We gotta find him quick.

405
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,519
Your appetite's gotten much bigger.

406
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,692
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Sam, relax. It's okay.

407
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,277
It's good.

408
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,780
Just means you're getting stronger,
that's all.

409
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,449
It means you're strong enough
to kill Lilith.

410
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,535
Just in time, too,
because the final seals are breaking.

411
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,163
How many are left?

412
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,540
- Three? Two?
- What?

413
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,877
- Where are the angels?
- Screwing the pooch, wherever they are.

414
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:48,340
The point is, it's looking more and more
like we're getting down to the final seal.

415
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,884
And I found out something big.

416
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,637
- What?
- Seal 66.

417
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,723
It can't be broken by just any demon.

418
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,351
Apparently,
only Lucifer's first can do it.

419
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,312
Lucifer's first?

420
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:07,526
Demon Sunday school story.
God prefers humans to angels.

421
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,904
Lucifer gets jealous
and then he gets creative.

422
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,408
And he twists and tempts a human soul
into the very first demon...

423
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,077
...as a "screw you" to God.

424
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,205
It's what got him locked up
in the first place.

425
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,874
That was Lilith?

426
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,752
She's way older than she looks.

427
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,048
Wait. So...

428
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,593
...if Lilith is the only one
who can break the final seal...

429
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,095
...if I get to her in time-

430
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,764
Then Lucifer never busts out of his cage.
Exactly.

431
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,057
Great.

432
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,893
- You figure out where she is?
- The bitch can hide.

433
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:46,273
But I finally have a lead on someone
who might be able to help us.

434
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,276
I closed in on a member
of Lilith's entourage.

435
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,778
You might call her...

436
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,574
- ... a personal chef.
- Chef? Seriously?

437
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,703
What does she eat?

438
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,913
You don't wanna know.

439
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,291
X- ray head to Radiology.

440
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,626
Hear about that horrible thing
at St. Paul's?

441
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,878
No.

442
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,798
One of the neonatal nurses walked
right off the unit with two babies.

443
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,925
- You are kidding me.
- Swear to God.

444
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,512
Worked there 17 years. Then one day,
out of the blue, she just does it.

445
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,645
That's just horrifying.

446
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,648
Now, she's saying that she doesn't
remember what happened.

447
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,484
Like she was possessed.

448
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,944
- Heh, nuts.
- I know.

449
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:36,656
- Who could ever lay a finger on them?
- I know.

450
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,786
They're just delicious.

451
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,510
So our demon gourmet nurse. Heh.

452
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,428
You sure?

453
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,599
She'll be there.
Graveyard shift tomorrow night.

454
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,353
Meantime, if you're gonna be
strong enough to kill Lilith...

455
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,356
...you're gonna need more
than I can give you now.

456
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,194
Sam.

457
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,030
Come on. It's okay.

458
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,367
I know I need more. I get it.
I know it's okay.

459
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,369
I just-

460
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,997
I wish he'd trusted me, you know?

461
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,541
Sorry.

462
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,211
I just hope...

463
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,673
...you know, when all this is over...

464
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,927
...I hope we can fix things.

465
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,393
Cops found the Escalade
in a ditch outside Elk River.

466
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,478
- How far away am I?
- A couple of hours.

467
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,981
I pulled up a weather map...

468
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,691
...made some calls.

469
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,818
There's a town not far, Cold Spring.

470
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,821
- Lighting up with demon sign.
- A good place to look.

471
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,532
- Hey, listen.
- What?

472
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,075
Us finding Sam?

473
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,912
It's gotta be about getting him back,
not pushing him away.

474
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,832
Right.

475
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,711
I know you're mad, Dean. I understand.
You got a right to be...

476
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,212
...but I'm just saying.

477
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,381
Be good to him anyway.

478
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,925
You gotta get through to him.

479
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,133
No.

480
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,384
Let her go.

481
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,054
Just take it easy.

482
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,599
Well, it must've been some party
you two had going...

483
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,311
...considering how hard you tried
to keep me from crashing it.

484
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,980
Well, solid try...

485
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,815
...but here I am.

486
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,317
Dean, I'm glad you're here.

487
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,654
Look. Let's just talk about this.

488
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,448
Soon as she's dead,
we can talk all you want.

489
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,080
- Ruby, get out of here.
- No, she's not going anywhere.

490
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,253
- She's poison.
- It's not what you think.

491
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,505
Look what she did to you.

492
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,925
She vanishes weeks at a time,
leaves you cracking out...

493
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,345
- ... for another hit-
- She was looking for Lilith.

494
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,473
French for manipulating your ass
10 ways from Sunday.

495
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,141
You're wrong, Dean.

496
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,437
Sam, you're lying to yourself.

497
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,608
I just want you to be okay.

498
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,196
You would do the same for me.
You know you would.

499
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,198
Just listen.

500
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,288
Just listen for a second.

501
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,790
We got a lead on a demon
close to Lilith.

502
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,709
Come with us, Dean.

503
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,210
We'll do this together.

504
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,212
That sounds great.

505
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,008
As long as it's you and me.
Demon bitch is a deal-breaker.

506
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,719
You kiss her goodbye,
we can go right now.

507
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,471
I can't.

508
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,808
Dean, I need her to help me kill Lilith.

509
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,353
I know you can't wrap your head
around it but maybe one day...

510
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,605
...you'll understand.

511
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,192
I'm the only one
who can do this, Dean.

512
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,908
No, you're not the one
who's gonna do this.

513
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,745
Right. That's right. I forgot.
The angels think it's you.

514
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,538
- You don't think I can?
- No.

515
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,749
You can't.

516
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,876
- You're not strong enough.
- Who are you?

517
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,419
I'm being practical here.

518
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,922
- I'm doing what needs to be done.
- Yeah?

519
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,008
You're not gonna do a single
damn thing.

520
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,635
Stop bossing me around, Dean.

521
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,763
Look.

522
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,681
My whole life...

523
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,434
...you take the wheel,
you call the shots...

524
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,228
...and I trust you
because you are my brother.

525
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,606
Now...

526
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,276
...I'm asking you, for once...

527
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,236
...trust me.

528
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,745
No. You don't know
what you're doing, Sam.

529
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,372
- Yes, I do.
- Then that's worse.

530
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,582
Why? Look, I'm telling you-

531
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,794
Because it's not something you're doing,
it's what you are!

532
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,798
It means-

533
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,300
What?

534
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,180
No.

535
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,145
Say it.

536
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,066
It means you're a monster.

537
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,272
You don't know me.

538
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,357
You never did.

539
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,694
And you never will.

540
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,867
You walk out that door...

541
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,536
...don't you ever come back.
