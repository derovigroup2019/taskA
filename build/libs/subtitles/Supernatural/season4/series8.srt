504
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,197
-Hang on a second.
-What?

505
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,827
You were right.

506
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,123
About what?

507
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,292
I shouldn't have lied to you.

508
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,131
I do remember everything
that happened to me in the pit.

509
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,634
Everything.

510
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,308
So tell me about it.

511
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,810
No.

512
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,400
I won't lie anymore.
But I'm not gonna talk about it.

513
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:47,324
Dean, look, you can't just shoulder
this thing alone. You gotta let me help.

514
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,825
How?

515
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,244
You think a little heart-to-heart...

516
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,998
...and some sharing and caring
is gonna change anything? Huh?

517
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,584
And somehow heal me?

518
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,422
I'm not talking about a bad day here.

519
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,757
I know that.

520
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,259
The things that I saw....

521
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,430
There aren't words.

522
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:17,437
There is no forgetting.
There's no making it better.

523
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:24,944
Because it is right here, forever.

524
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,534
You wouldn't understand.

525
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,705
And I could never
make you understand.

526
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,875
So I am sorry.
