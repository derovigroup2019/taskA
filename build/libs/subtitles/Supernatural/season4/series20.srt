Thanks to the original anonymous subber!

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,790
- Who are you?
- Castiel.

3
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:08,575
I mean what are you?

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,890
I'm an angel of the lord.

5
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:10,830
Some angel you are.

6
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:12,025
My true form

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,360
It can be
overwhelming to humans

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,780
And so can my
real voice...

9
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,110
But you already knew that.

10
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,760
Certain people -
special people -

11
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,360
Can perceive
my true visage.

12
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,260
What visage are
you in now, huh?

13
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,270
This? this is... a vessel.

14
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,860
You're possessing
some poor bastard?

15
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:28,375
He's a devout man.

16
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,555
he actually
prayed for this.

17
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,570
Something major must have
happened while I was downstairs,

18
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,090
'cause I can't back and -

19
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,540
And you're BFF
with a demon?

20
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,080
Why do you trust
her so much?

21
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,710
Because... she
saved my life.

22
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,490
Sucking blood? you got
to know that's wrong.

23
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,820
I wish to god
I could stop.

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,300
We need to talk.

25
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,490
I'm dreaming, aren't I?

26
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,770
It's not safe here.

27
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,050
Someplace more private.

28
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,630
More private? we're
inside my head.

29
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,030
Exactly.

30
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,000
Someone could
be listening.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,660
Cass, what's wrong?

32
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,520
Meet me here.

33
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,190
Go
- now.

34
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,905
What'd he say, Dean?

35
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,160
What was so important?

36
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,460
If I knew,
would I be here?

37
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,070
What the hell?

38
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,800
Looks like a
bomb went off.

39
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,690
There was a fight here.

40
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,390
Between who?

41
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,530
Check it out.

42
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,270
Look familiar?

43
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,210
Yeah, it does.

44
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,170
Anna used
something like that

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,620
To wish the angels
back to the cornfield.

46
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,350
So, what? Cass was
fighting angels?

47
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,050
I don't know.

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,120
Sam.

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,920
Cass?

50
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,100
Cass!

51
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,350
Hey! Cass!

52
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,670
What's
- what's going on?

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,070
Just take it
easy. take it easy.

54
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,180
Cass, you okay?

55
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,210
Castiel?

56
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,980
I'm not Castiel.

57
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,910
It's me.

58
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,810
Who's "me"?

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,620
Jimmy.

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,880
My name's Jimmy.

61
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,250
Where the hell is Castiel?

62
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,360
He's gone.

63
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,485
Mind slowing down?

64
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,590
You're gonna
give me angina.

65
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,450
I'm hungry.

66
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,250
When's the last
time you ate?

67
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,460
I don't know
- months.

68
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,960
What the hell
happened back there?

69
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,230
It looked like an
angel battle royal.

70
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,650
All I remember is there was
a flash of light, and I, uh...

71
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,710
I
- I woke up, and I was just, you know, like, me again.

72
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:33,980
So, what
- Cass just ditched out of your meat suit?

73
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,550
I really don't know.

74
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,620
You remember anything
about being possessed?

75
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,890
Anything at all?

76
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,090
Yeah, bits and pieces.

77
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,255
I mean, angel
inside of you -

78
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,790
It's kind of like being
chained to a comet.

79
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,760
Well, that doesn't
sound like much fun.

80
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,570
Understatement.

81
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,950
Cass said he wanted
to tell us something.

82
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,500
Please tell me
you remember that.

83
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,310
Sorry.

84
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,120
Come on. what do you know?

85
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,430
My name is Jimmy Novak.

86
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,750
I'm from
Pontiac, Illinois.

87
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,290
And I have a family.

88
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,690
Claire.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
Bless this food, o lord,

90
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,300
And ourselves to
thy loving service,

91
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,940
That we may always continue
in thy faith and fear

92
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,560
To the honor and
glory of thy name.

93
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,750
- Amen.
- Amen.

94
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,990
I can see my
head sticking out

95
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,140
From underneath
the front bumper.

96
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,340
My eyes were closed.

97
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,450
My head was turned
to the right side.

98
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,120
And on each side of me
is an angel, and, uh...

99
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,660
blank

100
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,480
So, what do we do?

101
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,815
What do you mean? the
guy's got a family.

102
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,300
We buy him a bus
ticket, send him home.

103
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,530
I don't know about that.

104
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,470
Dean, he's the
only lead we got.

105
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,360
He doesn't know anything.

106
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,770
Are you 100% about that?

107
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,900
You think he's lying?

108
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,250
Well, you want to go
Guantanamo on the guy?

109
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,870
Dean, maybe he doesn't
even know what he knows.

110
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,530
I say at least we
get him to Bobby's.

111
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,020
Maybe all he needs is -
is hypnosis or a p-psychic,

112
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,460
Or, hell, maybe Cass will
just drop back into him.

113
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,060
I don't know, man.

114
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,390
Dean, back there, that was
angel-on-angel violence.

115
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,270
Now, I don't know
what's going on,

116
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:03,810
but it's big,

117
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,300
And we can't just let the only
lead we've got just skip out.

118
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,660
What?

119
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,550
Remember when our job
was helping people -

120
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,540
Like getting them
back to their family?

121
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:14,870
You think I don't
want to help him?

122
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,845
I'm just being realistic.

123
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,110
I mean, hell, we're
doing him a favor.

124
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:17,595
How?!

125
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,370
Dean, if we want
to question the guy,

126
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,070
You can damn well bet
the demons do, too.

127
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,750
What the hell are you talking
about, I can't go home?

128
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,790
There's a good chance you
have a bull's-eye on your back.

129
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,720
What?

130
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,040
From who?

131
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,395
Demons.

132
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,505
Oh, come on. that's crazy.

133
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,580
What do they want with me?

134
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,100
I don't know
- information, maybe.

135
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,670
I don't know anything!

136
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,670
I know, but -

137
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,240
Look, I'm done, okay?

138
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,460
With demons, angels
- all of it.

139
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:45,520
I just want to go home.

140
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,475
We understand.

141
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,890
No, I don't think
that you do understand.

142
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,740
I've been shot and
stabbed and healed,

143
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,580
And my body's been
dragged all over the earth.

144
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,550
By some miracle, I'm
out, and I am done.

145
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,620
I've given enough, okay?

146
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,220
Look, all we're saying is
that until we figure this out,

147
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,160
The safest
place is with us.

148
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,190
How long?

149
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,720
We'll cross that bridge
when we get to it.

150
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,030
Where you going?

151
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,730
To see my wife
and daughter, okay?

152
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,030
No, you're not.

153
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,870
You're just gonna put
those people in danger.

154
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,140
So, what
- now I'm a prisoner?

155
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,010
Harsh way to put it.

156
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,900
Dean!

157
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,440
Would you hurry up?

158
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,710
Sorry
- uh, this is funny to you?

159
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,280
Mr. big bad prison guard,

160
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,310
And Jimmy McMook
gives you the slip?

161
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,810
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

162
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,520
What were you
doing, anyway?

163
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,980
I was getting a coke.

164
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,920
Was it a refreshing coke?

165
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,090
Can we just go, please?

166
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,370
- What the hell are you doing?!
- It's okay. I'm okay.

167
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,380
Jimmy.

168
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,880
Look.

169
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,840
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong.

170
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,980
He asked me to do it.

171
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,380
Who asked you to do it?

172
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,150
Castiel.

173
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,690
To prove my faith.

174
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,160
Look.

175
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,790
I'm fine.

176
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,490
It's a miracle.

177
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,330
Who's Castiel?

178
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,870
Hey, guys.

179
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,280
Geez!

180
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,780
Smooth.

181
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,480
You ever try
calling ahead?

182
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,450
I like the element
of surprise.

183
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,050
You look terrific.

184
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,390
Um... yeah.

185
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,620
Not the most
appropriate time, Dean.

186
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,890
You let Jimmy get away?

187
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,060
Talk to ginormo here.

188
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,930
Sam...

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,870
You seem... different.

190
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,440
Me? I don't know. Haircut?

191
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,710
That's not what
I'm talking about.

192
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,880
So, what'd Jimmy tell
you? he remember anything?

193
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,420
Why? what's going on?

194
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,890
It's Cass. He got
sent back home.

195
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,090
Well, more like
dragged back.

196
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,260
To heaven?

197
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,790
That's not a good thing?

198
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,200
No. That's a
very bad thing.

199
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,900
Painfully, awfully bad.

200
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,030
He must have seriously
pissed someone off.

201
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,140
Cass said he had something to
tell me, something important.

202
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,940
- What?
- I don't know.

203
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,310
Does Jimmy know?

204
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,740
I don't think so.

205
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,910
You don't think so?

206
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,650
Whatever it is, it's huge.

207
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,520
You got to find
out for sure.

208
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,480
That's why we're
going after Jimmy.

209
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,590
That's why you shouldn't have
let him go in the first place.

210
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,620
He's... probably
dead already.

211
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,700
Take the pills.

212
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,630
I'm not sick.

213
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,400
Jimmy, take the pills.

214
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,500
I know that this is
hard to understand...

215
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,470
But he chose me.

216
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,740
Castiel the angel?

217
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,810
He's spoken
to me now, Ames

218
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,210
A dozen times.

219
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,850
Hey, you believe
in god, don't you?

220
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,650
What kind of question
is that? of course.

221
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,390
And angels?

222
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,720
Yes, Jimmy.

223
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,590
So, why is it, then, so
hard for you to believe

224
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,790
That they're
talking to me?

225
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,730
Jimmy, you sell ad
time for a. m. radio.

226
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,190
No, he said that I'm
special, it's in my blood.

227
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,560
W
- what does that mean, it's in your blood? hmm?

228
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,860
He didn't say.

229
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,900
He just said that god has
chosen me for a higher purpose.

230
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,200
To do what?

231
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,640
You know, it's god's will.

232
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,710
Not really my place
to question it.

233
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,280
Hey, come here.

234
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,890
This is a blessing.

235
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,020
This is the most important
thing to ever happen to me.

236
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,760
I thought we were the
most important things

237
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,930
To ever happen to you.

238
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,090
Hey, have faith.

239
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,130
Jimmy... you're
scaring me.

240
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,600
God will provide.

241
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,770
If you won't take your pills
and if you won't get help...

242
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,840
... then I'm gonna take Claire
to my mother's in the morning.

243
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,960
so, I want to help you.

244
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,290
I'm about to lose
my... my family here

245
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,660
If you don't tell me how.

246
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,960
Please, Castiel,
just talk to me.

247
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,060
What do you want from me?

248
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,880
Yes, I understand.

249
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,380
Promise my family will
be okay, and I'll do it.

250
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,190
Then... yes.

251
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,820
Daddy?

252
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,600
I am not your father.

253
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,210
We, uh...

254
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,210
We stopped
looking for you.

255
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,980
I'm so sorry.

256
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,810
You were dead.

257
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,120
We, uh, we thought
you were dead.

258
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,790
I'm okay.

259
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,160
Claire, room, now.

260
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,100
Can I see her?

261
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,640
Oh... no.

262
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,010
I don't know yet.

263
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,180
It's been almost
a year, you know?

264
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,180
I know.

265
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,920
Think your daughter would have
wanted to know you were okay.

266
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,320
I was in a psych clinic.

267
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,930
I just wanted to get myself
straight before seeing you.

268
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,700
And no telephones, or...?

269
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,240
No. I know. You're
right. I'm...

270
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,810
I'm so sorry.

271
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,310
But it's all,
it's all over now.

272
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,110
I mean, I'm...
I'm really okay.

273
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,010
What does that mean?

274
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,050
I... I was, I was
confused, Amelia.

275
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,860
I was completely
delusional.

276
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,060
And I thought, I thought god
was calling me to something,

277
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,060
And I thought that
it was important.

278
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,200
And...

279
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,200
I was wrong.

280
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,140
I was such an idiot.

281
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,010
Heaven, hell...

282
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,210
None of that matters.

283
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,550
The only thing that's important
to me is you and Claire.

284
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,400
And I, uh...

285
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,570
I can't undo
what I've done.

286
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,240
But I just want
to come home again.

287
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,540
I don't know if
I can do that.

288
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,580
Not yet.

289
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,350
I mean, whatever
you're comfortable with.

290
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,130
Maybe we could start
with something smaller?

291
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,760
Like what?

292
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,630
I don't know.

293
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,670
Dinner?

294
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,230
where the hell
are you, Ruby?

295
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,540
This isn't funny anymore.

296
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,110
I'm all out.

297
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,640
Stop whatever
you're doing.

298
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,110
Call me.

299
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,280
I need more.

300
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,350
Hi, daddy.

301
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,720
Hi, baby.

302
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,070
Okay, so, we have
turkey and roast beef.

303
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,200
Better be okay.
it's all we have.

304
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,640
It's fine.

305
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,540
It's more than fine.

306
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,680
Shall we sit?

307
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,010
Yeah.

308
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,090
It's perfect.

309
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,090
Daddy... aren't
you gonna say grace?

310
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,540
no, honey, I
don't think I am.

311
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,300
Why are you crying?

312
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,480
'cause I'm happy.

313
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,420
Hey, Roger.

314
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,890
Hey, Ames. how you doing?

315
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,890
Good.

316
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,460
Am I crazy, or
did I just see

317
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,960
Your husband wander in
here about half an hour ago?

318
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,530
Yeah, uh, you did.

319
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,300
But, Roger, now's
not a good time -

320
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,930
Hey. there he is.

321
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,300
Son of a bitch. what
the hell happened to you?

322
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,170
Uh... long story.

323
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,640
But it's over.

324
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,640
Yeah?

325
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,840
I'm good.

326
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,580
Can I talk to you?

327
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,680
Can I get you a beer?

328
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,680
That'd be good.

329
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,450
Thanks.

330
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,020
get in here.

331
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,090
Buddy, you scared the hell
out of a lot of people.

332
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,690
I know, I know.

333
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,260
So, really, what happened?

334
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,530
Honestly?

335
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,590
Worst year of my life,

336
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,330
And you wouldn't
believe a word of it.

337
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,000
But... it's all okay now.

338
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,170
Swear.

339
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,200
Actually, no, it's not.

340
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,470
What do you mean?

341
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,410
Well, I mean, I'm gonna gut
your daughter while you watch.

342
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,940
Here you go.

343
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
What are you doing?!

344
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,850
- He's a demon!
- Jimmy, stop!

345
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,380
- Run! run!
- stop it!

346
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,120
- Where is it?
- Roger was your best friend.

347
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,450
Roger was a demon.

348
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,860
Don't cross this line.

349
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,390
Jimmy, you thought you were
better. but you are so sick.

350
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,290
- Look, I'm not crazy.
- stay the hell away from us!

351
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,030
- Just stay the hell away from us!
- this is very, very real.

352
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,200
Claire! no! run!

353
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,770
Leave her alone!

354
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,000
Please stay there!

355
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,330
Claire!

356
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,000
Damn it!

357
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,680
Hey, pal.

358
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,530
- Told you I'd gut the bitch.
- Roger.

359
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,210
- Daddy?
- just let her go, okay?

360
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,810
Now, me
- I would.

361
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,350
But the missus
- she has other ideas.

362
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,780
Daddy!

363
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,690
Oh, my god.

364
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,560
No!

365
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,900
go! get them out of here!

366
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,940
Go! go!

367
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,440
Can't get it
up, can you, Sam?

368
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,310
No, but I can.

369
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,360
Come on, come on, come on.

370
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,160
Oh, my god.

371
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,060
- Where's your wife?
- right here.

372
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:49,930
Let's go!

373
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,240
You were right.

374
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,540
Sorry we were.

375
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,250
But I'm telling you
- I don't know anything.

376
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,980
I don't think they're
inclined to believe you.

377
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,750
And even if they
did, you're a vessel.

378
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,090
They're still gonna want
to know what makes you tick.

379
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,960
Which means vivisection...
if they're feeling generous.

380
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,890
I'm gonna tell
you once again -

381
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,090
You're putting your
family in danger.

382
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,590
You have to come with us.

383
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,680
How long?

384
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,530
And don't give me that "cross that
bridge when we get to it" crap.

385
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,970
Don't you get it?

386
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,980
Forever.

387
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,240
The demons
will never stop.

388
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,070
You can never be
with your family.

389
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,720
So, you either get as far
away from them as possible

390
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,320
Or you put a
bullet in your head,

391
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,220
And that's how you
keep your family safe,

392
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,720
But there's no getting out
and there's no going home.

393
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,055
Well, don't
sugarcoat it, Sam.

394
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,830
I'm just telling
him the truth, Dean.

395
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,990
Someone has to.

396
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,280
So... I pretty much owe you
the biggest apology ever.

397
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,440
No, you don't.

398
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,780
Yes. I do.

399
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,980
I'm so sorry, Jimmy.

400
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,320
And I will never,
ever forgive myself

401
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,060
For letting you
walk out that door.

402
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,990
Well, you did what any
rational person would have done.

403
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,430
I mean, hell, I thought
I was crazy half the time.

404
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,370
So... demons, huh?

405
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,840
Yeah.

406
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,610
Can we...

407
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,610
Can we even
go home, or...?

408
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,980
What are we gonna do?

409
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,320
These boys are
gonna get you a car.

410
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,490
Don't ask me how.

411
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,760
And you're gonna take
Claire to Carl and Sally's

412
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,960
As fast as you can.

413
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,190
Wait. what about you?

414
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,070
No. I-I'm not going
anywhere without you, Jimmy.

415
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,800
Listen to me.

416
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,600
Every moment
that I'm with you,

417
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,340
You and Claire
are in danger.

418
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,140
I don't care. we are
not splitting up again.

419
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,410
We don't have a choice.

420
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,980
For how long?

421
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,650
We'll... cross that
bridge when we get to it.

422
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,130
we're family.

423
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,600
They will kill
you, Amelia.

424
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,900
And they'll kill Claire.

425
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,410
You just have to get as
far away from me as you can.

426
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,720
Okay, so, uh...
here's your car.

427
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,100
Take care of your
mom, okay, bub?

428
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,260
Why is he leaving again?

429
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,930
This is just not
my day, is it?

430
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,140
You little bitch.

431
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,210
What the hell
happened back there?

432
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,120
What?

433
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,150
You practically fainted
trying to gank a demon.

434
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,560
Okay, I didn't faint.

435
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,960
I got a little dizzy.

436
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,460
Well, you can call
it whatever you want.

437
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,860
Point is, you used to be
strong enough to kill Alastair.

438
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,030
Now you can't even kill
stunt demon number three?

439
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:22,270
What do you want me
to say about it, Dean?

440
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,000
For starters, what's
going on with your mojo?

441
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,840
I mean, it's yo-yo'ing
all over the place.

442
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,340
Now, I'm not trying to
pick a fight here, okay?

443
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,310
I just - y-you're
scaring me, man.

444
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,640
I'm scaring myself.

445
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,420
Hello?

446
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,420
Who is this?

447
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,190
It's your wife.

448
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,760
Amelia?

449
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,240
Oh, my god.

450
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,570
All right, they're
expecting you to come alone.

451
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,110
That's exactly what
you're gonna do.

452
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,240
We'll work our way
through the catwalks.

453
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,880
We'll be right behind you.

454
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,680
All you got to do is stay calm
and stall and let us do our job.

455
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,910
You want me to stay calm?

456
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,650
This is my family
we're talking about.

457
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,080
Listen to me
- this will work.

458
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,850
You understand?
nobody's gonna get hurt.

459
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,690
Whatever.

460
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,320
Give me a minute, okay?

461
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,760
There's no way they're expecting
him to come alone, Dean.

462
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,070
You know this is
probably a trap.

463
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,570
Yeah, I know.

464
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,230
That's why I have a plan.

465
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,710
Castiel, you
son of a bitch!

466
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,780
You promised me my
family would be okay!

467
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,150
You promised you were
gonna take care of them!

468
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,750
I've gave you everything
you asked me to give!

469
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,750
I gave you more!

470
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,090
This is the thanks I get?

471
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,250
This is what you do?

472
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,590
Your heaven?!

473
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,890
Help me, please!

474
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,490
You promised, Cass!

475
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,360
Just help me!

476
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,110
Typical.

477
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,260
Hi, honey. you're home.

478
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,130
Listen, I'm...

479
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,260
I'm begging you here.

480
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,700
You d-do whatever
you want with me...

481
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,830
But my wife and
daughter, they're just -

482
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,240
They're not a
part of this.

483
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,100
Oh, they're a big
part of this, Jimmy.

484
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,240
And p. s.
- you should have come alone.

485
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,480
I am alone.

486
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,650
Oh, you're such a liar.

487
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,010
Like I didn't think you'd
bring heckle and jeckle.

488
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,180
Damn it.

489
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,420
Nice plan, Dean.

490
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,320
Yeah, well, nobody
bats a thousand.

491
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,160
Got the knife?

492
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,560
And you know what's funny?

493
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,960
You wearing a soccer mom?

494
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,100
Is I was actually bummed
to get this detail.

495
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,100
Picking up an
empty vessel?

496
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,630
Sort of like a milk run.

497
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,470
Now look who
landed in my lap.

498
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,800
Yeah, well...

499
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,670
You got us, okay?

500
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,040
Let these people go.

501
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,680
Oh, Sam.

502
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,210
It's easy to
act chivalrous

503
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,110
When your wonder girl
powers aren't working, huh?

504
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,450
Now for the punch line -

505
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,850
Everybody dies.

506
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,500
Waste little orphan annie.

507
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,240
Castiel.

508
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,620
Of course we
keep our promises.

509
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,620
Of course you
have our gratitude.

510
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,720
You served us well.

511
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,930
Your work is done.

512
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,760
It's time to go home now
- your real home.

513
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,800
You'll rest forever in
the fields of the lord.

514
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,200
No.

515
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,340
Rest now, Jimmy.

516
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,810
No. Claire.

517
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,640
She's with me now.

518
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,880
She's chosen.

519
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,150
It's in her blood,
as it was in yours.

520
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,780
please, Castiel.

521
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,050
I mean, just
- just take me.

522
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,950
Take me, please.

523
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,560
I want to make
sure you understand.

524
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,560
You won't die... or age.

525
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,600
If this last year
was painful for you,

526
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,470
Picture a hundred
- a thousand more like it.

527
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,800
Doesn't matter.

528
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,210
You take me.

529
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,240
Just take me.

530
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,520
As you wish.

531
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,360
Cass, hold up.

532
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,030
What were you
gonna tell me?

533
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,130
I learned my lesson
while I was away, Dean.

534
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,540
I serve heaven.
I don't serve man.

535
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,910
And I certainly
don't serve you.

536
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,170
All right.

537
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,710
Let's hear it.

538
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,710
What?

539
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,980
Drop the bomb, man.

540
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,710
You saw what I did. come on.
stop the car. take a swing.

541
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,180
I'm not gonna
take a swing.

542
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,880
Then scream. chew me out.

543
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,090
I'm not mad, Sam.

544
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,690
Oh, come on.
you're not mad?

545
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,720
No.

546
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,330
Right. look, at least
let me explain myself.

547
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,060
Don't.

548
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,260
I don't care.

549
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,500
You don't care?

550
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,340
What do you want me to say
- that I'm disappointed?

551
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,140
Yeah, I am.

552
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,240
But mostly, I'm
just tired, man.

553
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,710
And I'm done.

554
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,510
I am just done.

555
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,220
Hey, Bobby.

556
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,590
Hey, you and your brother
better shag ass to my place ASAP.

557
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,525
What's going on?

558
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,230
The apocalypse, genius. now,

559
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,030
What'd he say?

560
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,570
Well, thanks for
shaking a tail.

561
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,340
Glad you got here.

562
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,380
Now, go on inside. I want
to show you something.

563
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,540
All right.

564
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,250
So, uh, what's the
big demon problem?

565
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,750
You are.

566
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,920
This is for your own good.

567
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,990
Guys?

568
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,330

569
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,630
