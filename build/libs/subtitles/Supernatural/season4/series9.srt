1
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,172
-Who are you?
-Castiel.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,508
I'm an angel of the Lord.

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,678
The symbol you saw is called
the rising of the witnesses.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,888
It figures into an ancient prophecy.

5
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,599
-What book is that prophecy from?
-Revelations.

6
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,810
This is a sign, boys.

7
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,438
SAM: A sign of what?
-The Apocalypse.

8
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,899
Those seals are
being broken by Lilith.

9
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,235
I don't think I like you anymore.

10
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,821
You think of the seals
as locks on a door.

11
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,116
-Okay, last one opens and....
-Lucifer walks free.

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,243
Tell me about the months
without brother.

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,580
About all the things you and
this demon bitch do in the dark.

14
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,084
Do you even know how far off
the reservation you've gone?

15
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,171
How far from normal, from human?

16
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,425
Cas said that if I don't stop you, he will.

17
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,388
CASTIEL: The raising of Samhain
is one of the 66 seals.

18
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,184
Breaking of the seal must be
prevented at all costs.

19
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,438
URIEL: You were told not
to use your abilities.

20
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,903
-What was I supposed to do?
-The only reason you're still alive...

21
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,821
...is because you've been useful.

22
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,616
The second you become
more trouble than you're worth...

23
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,367
...then I will turn you to dust.

24
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,328
As for your brother, tell him that...

25
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,081
...maybe he should climb off
that high horse of his.

26
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,542
Ask Dean what he remembers
from hell.

27
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,062
WOMAN:
Anna?

28
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,898
Do you know where you are?

29
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:53,570
You're at the Connor Beverly
Behavioral Medicine Center.

30
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,031
Do you know why you're here?

31
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,953
Do you remember what you did?

32
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,082
You were hysterical.

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,627
It took four people to restrain you.

34
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,548
I was trying to warn them.

35
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,092
WOMAN:
Warn who?

36
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,302
Everyone.

37
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,347
Forget it.

38
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,891
It was stupid.

39
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,228
What were you trying
to warn them about?

40
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,817
Look.

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,279
I get it. You think I'm nuts.

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,867
If I were you, I'd think I was nuts.

43
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,703
But it's all true.

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,083
It's okay. You can tell me.
I'm here to listen.

45
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:55,090
The end is coming.

46
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:01,138
-The Apocalypse.
-The Apocalypse, like in the Bible?

47
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,810
Kind of. I mean, same bottom line.

48
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:13,233
This demon, Lilith, is trying
to break the 66 seals...

49
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:19,698
...to free Lucifer from hell.
Lucifer will bring the Apocalypse.

50
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,660
So...

51
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,747
...smoke them if you got them.

52
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,760
Anna?

53
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,264
Sorry.

54
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,018
-What were you doing?
-Nothing.

55
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,980
Just listening.

56
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:57,152
So you were saying that there are
66 of these seals in the world?

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,115
No. No. There are about
600 possible seals.

58
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,868
And Lilith only has
to break 66 of them...

59
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,080
...and no one knows
which 66 she's gonna break.

60
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,289
I see.

61
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,546
That's why it's nearly impossible
to stop her.

62
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,926
And that's why
the angels are losing.

63
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,431
That's why we're all gonna die.

64
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,524
Time for your meds, Anna.

65
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,737
Anna?

66
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,035
What's the matter, sweetie?

67
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,080
Your face. What happened
to your face?

68
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,749
I know.

69
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,836
I'm downright kissable.

70
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,337
Shh.

71
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:35,334
SAM: Come on, one more.
Just give me a chance to win it back.

72
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,086
-It's your cash.
-Excuse me.

73
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,505
My brother's a little sauced
to be making bets.

74
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,466
Hey, he insisted.

75
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,885
You've already taken, what,
two bills off him?

76
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,471
-I'm just saying.
-Hey, shut up, Dean. I'm fine.

77
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,848
No, you're not fine, you're drunk.

78
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,518
-Let's make it 500.
-Five hundred?

79
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,812
Sure.

80
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,274
SAM: Five hundred.
-Your break.

81
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,419
Keep the money.

82
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,547
Keep the money?

83
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,257
But....

84
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,556
SAM:
Hey.

85
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,975
Got a lot of nerve
showing up anywhere near me.

86
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,229
-I just have some info and then I'm gone.
-What is it?

87
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,730
I'm hearing a few whispers.

88
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,525
Great. Demon whispers. That's reliable.

89
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,403
A girl named Anna escaped
from a locked ward yesterday.

90
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,905
The demons seem
pretty keen on finding her.

91
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,658
Some heavy hitters turned out
for the Easter egg hunt.

92
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,535
-Why? Who is she?
-No idea.

93
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,703
But I'm thinking that she's important.

94
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,164
Because the order's
to capture her alive.

95
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,084
I just figured that
whatever the deal is...

96
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,087
...you might wanna find this girl
before the demons do.

97
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,841
Look, maybe we should check it out.

98
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,553
-We're working a case, but thanks.
-What case?

99
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,140
-We've got leads, big leads.
-Sounds dangerous.

100
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,933
Ain't goose-chasing some chick...

101
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,854
...who for all we know doesn't exist,
just because you say she's important.

102
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,440
Just delivering the news.
Do what you want with it.

103
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,234
Far as I'm concerned,
I told you, I'm done.

104
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,736
Wait, this hospital Anna
escaped from.

105
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,322
Got a name?

106
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,537
Can I get a copy
of the Missing Persons report?

107
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,498
Great. Okay. Thanks.

108
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,712
-Well, Anna Milton's definitely real.
-Don't mean the case is real.

109
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,924
-This hospital's a three-day drive.
-We've driven further for less, Dean.

110
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,139
-You got something to say, say it.
-I'm saying it. This sucks.

111
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,601
You're not pissed we're after the girl.

112
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,936
-You're pissed Ruby threw us the tip.
-Right.

113
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,481
Far as you're concerned,
the hell bitch is family.

114
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,525
Something major must have
happened while I was downstairs...

115
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,153
...because I come back
and you're BFF with a demon.

116
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,447
I told you.
She helped me go after Lilith.

117
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,116
Well, thanks for the thumbnail.
Real vivid.

118
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,118
You wanna fill in a little detail?

119
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,496
Sure, Dean, let's trade stories.

120
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,998
You first. How was hell?
Don't spare the details.

121
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,635
Come on!

122
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,346
Where the hell are you?!

123
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,267
MAN: I was wondering whether
to come or not.

124
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,978
I mean, you shot one
of my coworkers.

125
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,191
Don't take this
the wrong way, Sam...

126
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,110
...but you don't look so hot, buddy.

127
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,240
Guess burying your brother
didn't agree with you.

128
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,165
Well?

129
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,876
Let's see that special little knife
of yours first.

130
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,011
No Devil's Traps either.

131
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,848
I'm not here to play games.

132
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,603
Well, let me guess.

133
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,855
You wanna make a deal.

134
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:14,195
And round and round
the Winchesters go.

135
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,490
Sorry, Sam. That's not gonna happen.

136
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,003
I don't want ten years.
I don't want one year.

137
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,632
I don't want candy.
I want to trade places with Dean.

138
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,216
No.

139
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,802
Just take me! It's a fair trade!

140
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,262
No.

141
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,516
Why not?

142
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,228
Lilith wants me dead.
Just let Dean go and she can have me.

143
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,649
Don't you understand, Sam?
It's not about your soul.

144
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,109
Dean's in hell,
right where we want him.

145
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,279
We've got everything exactly
the way we want it.

146
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,448
You wanna kill me, go ahead.

147
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,825
I've made peace with my lord.

148
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,471
WOMAN: Of course,
I wanna help however I can.

149
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,224
SAM: The orderly has no recollection
of Anna's escape?

150
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,434
Apparently, she knocked
him unconscious.

151
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,144
The blow caused some amnesia.

152
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,480
He doesn't even remember
coming into her room.

153
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,733
Hell of a right hook to knock out
a guy with 80 pounds on her.

154
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,985
We think she may have planned this.

155
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,655
-Waited behind the door.
-Right.

156
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,449
You mentioned
Anna's illness was recent.

157
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,452
Two months ago
she was happy, well-adjusted.

158
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,247
Journalism major,
lots of friends, bright future.

159
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,416
So, what happened?
She just flipped?

160
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,335
Well, that's the tragedy
of schizophrenia.

161
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,963
Within weeks,
Anna was overtaken by delusions.

162
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,549
What kind of delusions?

163
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,634
She thought
demons were everywhere.

164
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,387
Interesting.

165
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,058
WOMAN: It's not uncommon for our
patients to believe that monsters are real.

166
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,729
Well, that's just batty.

167
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,537
It's Revelations.

168
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,915
Since when does the Book of
Revelations have jack-o-lanterns?

169
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,501
It's a little-known translation.

170
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,589
Well, Anna's father
was a church deacon.

171
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,384
When she became ill, her paranoia
took on religious overtones.

172
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:46,473
She was convinced the devil was about
to rise up and end the world.

173
