00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,049
...because I'm starting to cramp like a--
Son of a bitch.

174
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,176
Quit whining.

175
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,638
No, Sam, I mean, son of a bitch.

176
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,809
-Hey.
-Hi.

177
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,023
So? Our apple-bobbing cheerleader?

178
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,693
Tracy, the Wallace's babysitter.

179
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,696
She told me she'd
never even heard of Luke Wallace.

180
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,158
Interesting look for a centuries-old witch.

181
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,369
If you were a 600-year-old hag
and you could pick any costume...

182
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,372
...to come back in,
wouldn't you go for a hot cheerleader?

183
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,833
I would.

184
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,503
Mm.

185
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,636
Well, Tracy's not as wholesome
as she looks.

186
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,180
Did some digging.

187
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,850
Apparently, she got into a violent
altercation with one of her teachers.

188
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,226
Got suspended from school.

SAM:
Bring back memories?

192
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,541
What do you mean?

193
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,587
-Being a teenager, all that angst.
-Oh.

194
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,174
-What'd you think I meant?
-Nothing.

WOMAN: That's all?

196
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,930
Now, that brings back memories.

SAM: Okay. Don.
-Even my students call me Don.

00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,151
DEAN:
Yeah, we get it, Don.

I'm Agent Geddy. This is Agent Lee.

203
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,406
We just had
a few questions about Tracy Davis.

204
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,911
Yeah, Tracy. Bright kid, loads of talent.
It's a shame she got suspended.

205
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,081
You two had a violent altercation?

206
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,793
Yeah, she exploded. If Principal Morrow
hadn't walked by when he did...

207
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,461
...Tracy would've clawed my eyes out.

208
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,755
-Why?
-I was only trying...

209
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,590
...to rap with her about her work.

210
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,093
It had gotten inappropriate
and disturbing.

211
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,681
More disturbing than those guys?

212
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:15,436
She would cover page after page
with these bizarre, cryptic symbols.

213
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,814
And then there were the drawings.

214
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:23,069
Detailed images of killings.
Gory, primitive.

215
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:27,490
She would depict herself
in the middle of them, participating.

216
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,620
Symbols? What kind of symbols?
Anything like this?

217
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,749
Yeah. I think that might've been
one of them.

218
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,794
-Know where Tracy is now?
-I imagine at her apartment.

219
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:40,962
Her apartment?

220
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,673
Yeah. She got here
about a year ago, alone.

221
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,259
As I understood it,
as an emancipated teen.

222
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,470
God only knows
what her parents were like.

223
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,773
DEAN: So?
SAM: Tracy was nowhere I could find.

224
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,359
-Any luck with her friends?
-Luck is not our style.

225
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,695
Friends don't know where she is.

226
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,822
She could be making the third sacrifice.

227
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,033
Yes, thank you, Sam.

228
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,493
Trick or treat?

229
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,954
-This is a motel.
-So?

230
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,040
So we don't have any candy.

231
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,168
-No, we have a ton in the--
-We did, but it's gone.

232
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,340
-Sorry, kid, we can't help you.
-I want candy.

233
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,176
Well, I think you've had enough.

234
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,229
Who are you?

235
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,315
DEAN:
Sam. Sam, wait!

236
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,319
That's Castiel. The angel.

237
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,489
Him, I don't know.

238
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,867
Hello, Sam.

239
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:58,039
Oh, my God. Or, uh.... I didn't mean to--
Sorry. It's an honor.

240
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,209
Really. I've heard a lot about you.

241
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,716
And I you.

242
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:14,305
Sam Winchester,
the boy with the demon blood.

243
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,686
Glad to hear you've ceased
your extracurricular activities.

244
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,187
URIEL:
Let's keep it that way.

245
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,065
Yeah, okay, Chuckles. Who's your friend?

246
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,609
This raising of Samhain,
have you stopped it?

247
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,903
DEAN: Why?
-Dean, have you located the witch?

248
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,698
-Yes, we've located the witch.
-And is the witch dead?

249
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,449
-No, but--
-We know who it is.

250
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,203
Apparently, the witch knows
who you are too.

251
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,457
This was inside the wall of your room.

252
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,711
If we hadn't found it,
surely one or both of you would be dead.

253
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,422
Do you know where the witch is now?

254
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,135
-We're working on it.
-That's unfortunate.

255
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,928
DEAN:
What do you care?

256
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,265
The raising of Samhain
is one of the 66 seals.

257
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,308
So this is about your buddy Lucifer?

258
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,395
URIEL:
Lucifer is no friend of ours.

259
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,772
It's just an expression.

260
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,108
Lucifer cannot rise.

261
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,945
Breaking of the seal must be
prevented at all costs.

262
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,656
Okay, great.

263
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,160
Now that you're here, tell us
where the witch is. We'll gank her.

264
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,953
We are not omniscient.

265
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,998
This witch is very powerful.
She's cloaked even our methods.

266
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,292
Okay, we already know who she is.

267
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,252
-So, if we work together--
URIEL: Enough.

268
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,130
Okay, who are you
and why should I care?

269
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,924
This is Uriel.

270
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,803
He's what you might call a specialist.

271
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,641
What kind of a specialist?

272
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,689
What are you gonna do?

273
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,485
You, both of you, need to leave
this town immediately.

274
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,780
-Why?
-Because we're about to destroy it.

275
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,248
This is your plan?
You're gonna smite the whole town?

276
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,959
We're out of time. This witch has to die.

277
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,171
-The seal must be saved.
-There are a thousand people here.

278
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,048
One thousand two hundred fourteen.

279
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,676
-And you're willing to kill them all?
-This isn't the first time I've...

280
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,261
...purified a city.

281
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,516
Look, I understand, this is regrettable.

282
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,601
-Regrettable?
-We have to hold the line.

283
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,770
Too many seals have broken already.

284
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,314
And now this town has to pay the price?

285
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,651
It's the lives of 1000
against the lives of 6 billion.

286
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,903
-There's a bigger picture here.
-Right.

287
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,823
Because you're "bigger picture"
kind of guys.

288
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:42,703
Lucifer cannot rise.
He does, and hell rises with him.

289
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,581
Is that something
that you're willing to risk?

290
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,042
SAM: We'll stop this witch
before she summons anyone.

291
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,920
Your seal won't be broken
and no one has to die.

292
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,881
We're wasting time
with these mud monkeys.

293
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,302
I'm sorry, but we have our orders.

294
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,804
No, you can't do this.

295
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,849
You're angels.
I mean, aren't you supposed to--

296
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,684
You're supposed to show mercy.

297
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,893
Says who?

298
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,147
-We have no choice.
-Of course you have a choice.

299
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,441
I mean, come on. What, you've
never questioned a crap order, huh?

300
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,571
-Are you just a couple of hammers?
-Look, even if you can't understand it...

301
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,947
...have faith.

302
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,658
-The plan is just.
-How could you even say that?

303
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,870
Because it comes from heaven.
That makes it just.

304
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,124
Well, it must be nice
to be so sure of yourselves.

305
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,920
Tell me something, Dean.
When your father gave you an order...

306
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,172
...didn't you obey?

307
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,803
Well, sorry, boys.
Looks like the plans have changed.

308
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,389
You think you can stop us?

309
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,600
No.

310
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,769
But if you're gonna smite
this whole town...

311
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,899
...then you're gonna have to smite us
with it because we are not leaving.

312
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,943
You went to the trouble
of busting me out of hell...

313
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,654
...I figure I'm worth something
to the man upstairs.

314
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,242
You wanna waste me?

315
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,952
Go ahead.

316
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,245
See how he digs that.

317
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,789
I'm gonna drag you out of here myself.

318
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,168
But you'll have to kill me.
Then we're back to the same problem.

319
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,503
I mean, come on.

320
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,591
You're gonna wipe out
a whole town for one little witch?

321
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,470
Sounds to me like you're
compensating for something.

322
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,642
We can do this.

323
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,855
We will find that witch
and we will stop the summoning.

324
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,984
-Castiel, I will not let these--
-Enough.

325
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,405
I suggest you move quickly.

326
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,845
Astronaut!

327
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,811
What?

328
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,396
Nothing.

329
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,150
I thought they'd be different.

330
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,945
-Who? The angels?
-Yeah.

331
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,738
I tried to tell you.

332
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,448
I just....

333
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,118
I mean, I thought they'd be righteous.

334
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,790
Well, they are righteous.
I mean, that's kind of the problem.

335
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,376
There's nothing more
dangerous than some A-hole...

336
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,169
...who thinks he's on a holy mission.

337
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:46,971
But, I mean, this is God and heaven?
And this is what I've been praying to?

338
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,765
Look, man,
I know you're into the whole God thing.

339
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,935
You know, Jesus on a tortilla,
and stuff like that.

340
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,148
