513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
the movie shut down

1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
supernatural season 4  episode 5

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
YYeTs www.yyets.net

3
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,830
No,I -- I agree.
it's a hell of a case.

4
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,330
A little more gusto,please.

5
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,100
It's just...the world
is coming to an end.

6
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,160
Things are a little
complicated,you know?

7
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,660
Yeah,well,we can't save
the world,not today anyway.

8
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,460
But what we can do is
chop off some vamps' heads.

9
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,330
Come on,man,it's like
the good old days.

10
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,800
An honest-to-goodness
monster hunt.

11
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,730
It's about time the
winchesters got back to tackling

12
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,860
A straightforward,black-and-white
case.

13
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,900
We still got to see
the new "raiders" movie.

14
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,130
­ Saw it.

15
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,860
Without me?

16
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,730
You were in hell.

17
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
That's no excuse.

18
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,400
Big pretzel!

19
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,500
Thank you.

20
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,760
Guten tag.

21
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,560
"guten tag" yourself.

22
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,690
Looks like that's our man.

23
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,560
Sheriff dietrich.

24
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,730
Are you the boys from the fed?

25
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,860
Agents angus and young.

26
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,590
We called ahead
about your,uh,problem.

27
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,860
Right. um...

28
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,200
I'll tell you what,

29
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,230
Why don't we talk this out
away from the crowd,huh?

30
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,800
26 Marissa wright,26,

31
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,300
Just up from lockhard for the 'fest.

32
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,530
Terrible. just terrible.

33
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,800
It's the last thing

34
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,130
This town needs at
peak tourist season.

35
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,760
Definitely the last thing
marissa wright needed.

36
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,130
What the hell?

37
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,930
Yeah,you got
me -- I mean,

38
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,260
This killer's some kind of grade
-"a" wacko,right?

39
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,800
I mean,some satan-worshipping,anne
rice-reading,

40
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,260
Gothic,psycho vampire wannabe.

41
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,860
Sheriff,in your report,you
mentioned a witness.

42
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,430
Yeah,I wished I didn't.
but our witness insisted.

43
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,800
That's ed brewer.

44
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,760
Not exactly what you'd call reliable.

45
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,730
I remember you.

46
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,000
And I remember you...

47
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,400
"jamie."

48
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,730
I never forget a
pretty... everything.

49
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,730
We're looking for ed brewer.

50
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,030
What do you want with ed?

51
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,030
Well,we are,uh...

52
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,060
...federal agents.

53
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,500
Mr. brewer was witness to
a serious crime. we just

54
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,660
Wait a minute. you're a fed?

55
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,200
Wow,you don't come on like a fed.

56
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,960
Seriously?

57
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,460
I'm a maverick,ma'am.

58
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,460
A rebel with a badge.

59
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,330
One thing I don't
play by -- the rules.

60
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,500
Okay,maverick.

61
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,690
Um,so,where can we find mr. brewer?

62
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,400
I told the cops everything I saw.

63
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,060
No one believes me.

64
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,460
Why should you be any different?

65
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,200
Believe me,mr.
brewer,we're different.

66
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,930
I spoke the god's honest
truth,and now I'm the town joke.

67
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,660
Marissa wright's
murder is no joke to us.

68
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,230
And we want to hear everything,

69
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,300
No matter how strange it may seem.

70
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,760
­ We have a lot of
experience with strange.

71
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,130
It was just after midnight.

72
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,560
I just left here,and
like I do every night,

73
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,330
I cut through the
park on the way home.

74
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,230
At first,I thought it
was a couple kissing.

75
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,460
But she was... struggling too much.

76
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,300
And this man,

77
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:47,360
He was -- well,he
was biting her neck.

78
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,160
Can you describe her assailant?

79
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,630
Oh,he was a vampire.

80
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,360
Okay,right. and
by that,you mean --

81
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,630
You know,a vampire.

82
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,530
So,he looked like

83
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,830
He looked like a vampire,

84
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,430
You know,with the fangs

85
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,400
And the slicked-back
hair and the fancy cape

86
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,460
And the little medallion
thingy on the ribbon.

87
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,690
You mean like a dracula?

88
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,200
­ Exactly. like a dracula.

89
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,660
Right down to the accent.

90
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,630
The accent. yep.

91
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,460
What did he say?

92
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,730
You know,something like...

93
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,690
"stay away,mortal!

94
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,730
The night is mine!"

95
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,800
You do believe me,don't you?

96
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,130
They must be here following
up on that murdered woman.

97
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,800
Crazy ed and his vampire story.

98
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,960
He might be weird,but he's not crazy.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,690
Look,you're just saying that

100
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,760
'cause the guy has a crush on
you and he tips you in $20s.

101
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,860
Lucy.

102
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,860
So,you got a beer back there for me?

103
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,690
I don't know,agent
young. you off duty?

104
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,530
And then some.

105
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,030
So,what do you think?

106
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,500
Goth,psycho vampire wannabe,right?

107
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,730
Definitely not our kind of case.

108
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,500
­ Agreed. but who cares?

109
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,160
Room's paid for,and it's oktoberfest.

110
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,500
Come on,brother.

111
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,560
Beer and bar wenches.

112
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,300
Pretty sure women
today don't react well

113
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,760
To the whole "wench" thing,Dean.

114
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,590
Hey,bar wench,where's that beer?

115
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,260
Coming up,good sir!

116
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,800
Dude,oktoberfest.

117
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,060
There you go.

118
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,460
­ What can I get you?

119
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,400
Oh,he doesn't drink.

120
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,730
He's a christian scientist.
doesn't even take aspirin.

121
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,100
He's a real drag on stakeouts.

122
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,460
You're funny.

123
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,060
I'm a lot more than that.

124
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,460
I'd love to get a chance
to show you the rest.

125
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,030
What time you get off?

126
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,530
Ha ha. like I said,"funny."

127
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,260
Man,it is time to right some wrongs.

128
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,330
Come again?

129
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,130
Look at me.

130
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,500
I came back from the furnace

131
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,130
Without any of my old scars,right?

132
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,960
You know,bullet wounds,knife cuts,

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,330
None of the off-angled
fingers from all the breaks.

134
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,590
I mean,my hide is as
smooth as a baby's bottom,

135
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,300
Which leads me to conclude,

136
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:22,900
Sadly... that my virginity is intact.

137
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,300
What?

138
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
-I have been
re-hymenated.  -re...

139
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,100
Please.

140
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,260
Dean,maybe angels can
pull you out of hell,

141
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,400
But no one could do that.

142
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,430
Brother,I have been re-hymenated.

143
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,630
And the dude will not abide.

144
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,760
All right,dude.

145
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,930
Well,you go do
whatever you got to do,

146
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,600
And I'm gonna go back to
the room and get some sleep.

147
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,400
So? how 'bout tonight?

148
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,900
Oh,sorry. I promised
lucy a girls' night out.

149
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,700
Besides,no self-respecting bar wench

150
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,960
Lets herself get picked up by
a customer on the first try.

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,430
Well,I'm not a customer.
I'm a federal agent.

152
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,400
Try again tomorrow,g-man.

153
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,630
I wish I could.

154
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,560
-I don't think we're staying on the case. 
-what?

155
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,130
Is it too weird for you?

156
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,000
Not weird enough.

157
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,960
-Rick. did you hear that?
-what?

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,300
It sounded like a wolf.

159
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,600
Come on,marie,don't
change the subject.

160
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,500
I told you what could happen
to a man if he doesn't --

161
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,430
-  - -Those stories
aren't true. -they are.

162
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,830
Baby,if a man doesn't get the stuff

163
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,460
Out of his system
regularly,it can back up

164
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,260
And cause all kinds of...
medical-type problems.

165
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,060
Shh,do you hear that?

166
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,610
Anne marie,there aren't
any wolves in pennsylvania.

167
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,240
And then it just -- it just
tore rick into little pieces.

168
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,790
Ma'am,we understand how hard this is,

169
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,830
But can you describe the creature?

170
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:53,790
Oh.

171
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,800
It was a werewolf.

172
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,860
A werewolf?

173
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,530
-You're sure?
-oh,yeah.

174
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,000
With the furry face
and the black nose

175
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,300
T- And the claws and the
torn-up pants and shirt,

176
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,160
Like from the old movies.

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Um,well...

178
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,330
Okay,so...

179
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,330
Thank you for your time.

180
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,260
­  First a dracula and now a
full-on movie-time wolf man?

181
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,830
What the hell is
going on in this town?

182
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,330
Ohh. whew.

183
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,630
Damn!

184
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,960
All right.

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,130
Whatever did this
wasn't a psycho wannabe.

186
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,560
Look at those bite marks.

187
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,560
Right down to the bone...

188
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,860
And deeper.

189
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,330
Strong enough to tear a healthy
man apart limb from limb.

190
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,330
Could be a werewolf.

191
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,700
Yeah,except,look.

192
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,200
The heart's still there in one piece.

193
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,900
They never leave the heart behind.

194
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,100
Thus I reiterate -- what
the hell is going on?

195
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,030
Well,I was hoping you
boys could tell me.

196
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,270
I just got a rush
job back from the lab

197
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,200
On those fibers we found on the body.

198
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,230
Canine. wolf hairs.

199
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,360
I'm getting a headache.

200
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,100
I don't know,man.

201
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,060
Looks like we've stumbled
on to a midnight showing

202
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,860
Of "dracula meets wolf man."

203
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,030
Is that it?

204
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,200
I don't know.

205
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,900
I mean,wolf man seems real enough.

206
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,430
­ It makes dracula seem a
little less impossible,I guess.

207
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,100
Yeah,but werewolves
don't grow wolf hair.

208
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,230
-  - -That's just
a myth. -yeah.

209
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,100
So,what? we've got a vampire

210
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,960
And a werewolf monster
mashing this town?

211
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,930
Looked like you guys
are staying a while.

212
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,360
I heard about rick deacon.

213
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,830
Yeah,this case just got weird enough

214
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,860
For,uh,our department.

215
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,100
Well,beers are on me.

216
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,460
And,just so you know,I get
off at midnight tonight.

217
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,930
Oh,it's not
another,uh,girls' night out?

218
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,230
Doesn't have to be.

219
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,560
-    -  -Okay,then. I'll
see you tonight. -okay,then.

220
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,960
­ Hey,you think this dracula
could turn into a bat?

221
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,830
bat would be cool.

222
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,660
That's right.

223
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,660
Yeah,an egyptian kind of deal.

224
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,000
No,it was just sitting
there on the loading dock.

225
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,860
No,doctor,there's
no shipping invoice.

226
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,900
There's no nothing.

227
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,260
You think helen has any
record of it in her files?

228
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,000
Holy mother of crap!

229
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,960
No!

230
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,660
No!

231
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,030
This sarcophagus isn't ancient.

232
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,760
It's from a prop house in philly.

233
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,900
Well...

234
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,560
It goes well with
the bucket of dry ice

235
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
He was keeping in it.

236
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,300
Is he making his own special effects?

237
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,900
Yeah,a mummy with a good
sense of showmanship.

238
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,230
This is stupid.

239
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,230
Oh,damn it. jamie. I'm late.

240
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,400
You're good here with
the mummy and the...

241
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,660
Crazy
--

242
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,330
-  - -Yeah.
-yeah.

243
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Your loss,g-man.

244
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,330
Good evening.

245
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:57,700
­ I have watched you
many nights from afar.

246
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,500
My passion knows no bounds!mina

247
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:07,430
You are the reincarnation
of my beloved,

248
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,260
And I must have you.

249
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,160
Ohh!

250
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,630
... Mary,son of a...

251
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,000
Jamie!

252
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,330
Jamie.

253
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,460
Son of a bitch.

254
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,800
You should not use such language

255
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,660
In the presence of my bride.

256
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,330
Okay.

257
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,000
Jamie,run!

258
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,200
­  You have no choice
in the matter,mr. harker.

259
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,360
Mina is mine!

260
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,800
Hey. you guys all right?

261
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,960
Yeah,I think so.

262
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,400
And I think I know what's going on.

263
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,400
Yeah?

264
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,060
Part of it at least.

265
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,460
Uh,the ear part?

266
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,130
­  Ripped it off of
dracula's head. touch it.

267
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,860
Feel familiar to you?

268
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,600
Oh,man.

269
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,260
The skin of a shapeshifter,

270
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,100
Just like st. louis
and just like milwaukee.

271
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,360
Of course this one's all
holding buckets of crazy.

272
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,300
Oh,and,uh...

273
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,360
This must have fallen
off during the fight.

274
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,730
Look at the label on the ribbon.

275
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,460
It's a costume rental.

276
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,500
All three
monsters --

277
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,900
The dracula,wolf
man,and the mummy --

278
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,200
All the same critter,

279
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,130
Which means we need
to catch this freak

280
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,300
Before he "Creature from
the black lagoon's" somebody.

281
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,930
So,you guys are like Mulder
and Scully or something,

282
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,800
And the x files are real?

283
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,660
No,"the x files" is a
tv show. this is real.

284
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,030
Okay,so,the stagecraft,the costuming

285
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,630
It's like he's trying to reenact

286
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,060
His favorite monster-movie moments,

287
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,360
Right down to the bloody murders.

288
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,600
­mina Wait a second.
who the hell is mina?

289
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,630
Mina? yeah.

290
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,860
That's what he called jamie.

291
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,330
And he called me mr. harker.

292
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,800
­ Jonathan harker?

293
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,430
They're characters from
the movies and the novels --

294
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,460
­ Mina,dracula's intended bride,

295
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,260
Harker,the fianc that
stands in the way.

296
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,660
Seems like he's fixating on you,

297
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,500
Like he sees you as his bride.

298
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,160
Wow. lucky me.

299
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,500
But to fixate on you,

300
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,600
My guess is that the shifter
has to have seen you before

301
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,100
Or been around you.

302
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,760
Jamie,has anybody
strange come to town,

303
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,000
Somebody that has taken
a specific notice of you?

304
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,430
I don't know,Dean. it's oktoberfest.

305
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,130
I'm a bartender.
there's lots of people.

306
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,600
I...

307
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,260
Wait a second. there is ed.

308
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,460
"ed brewer" ed?

309
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,730
Yeah.

310
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,660
He moved here about a month ago.

311
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,630
Lucy swears he has a crush on me.

312
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,260
He comes in almost every night.

313
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,900
But,you know,I don't think
he's the type of guy --

314
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,930
Where does ed live?

315
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,260
I don't know.

316
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,060
But he works at the
old movie theater.

317
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,630
I think he's a projectionist there.

318
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,600
Take care of mina? yep.

319
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,200
So,monsters are real.

320
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,260
Some of them,yeah.

321
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,000
And the shapeshifter,

322
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,860
He can turn into different people.

323
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,030
Yeah.

324
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,800
­ Yeah,except this one's turning

325
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,900
Into the great
monsters of screenland,

326
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,300
Which is a new one for me.

327
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,300
You're not really fbi,are you?

328
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,800
Not so much.

329
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,360
So,this is what you do?

330
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,930
You and your partner just
tramp across the country

331
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,200
On your own dime

332
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,700
Until you find some
horrible nightmare to fight?

333
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,960
Some people paying for.

334
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,200
What?

335
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,430
That must suck.

336
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,530
I mean,you're giving up your
life for this terrible...

337
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,360
I don't know,responsibility.

338
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,400
Last few years,I started
thinking that way,

339
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:17,200
And,uh,you know,it started
sort of weighing on me.

340
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,000
Of course,that was before...

341
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,260
A little while ago,I had this

342
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,930
­ It's called a
near-death experience.

343
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,300
Very near.

344
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,130
...when I came to...

345
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,800
­ There were different.

346
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,130
My life's been different.

347
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,400
I realize that I help people.

348
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,730
Not just help
them,though. I save them.

349
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,100
I guess it's
-- it's awesome.

350
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,000
It's kind of like a gift...

351
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,560
Like a mission.

352
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,030
Kind of like a... a mission from god.

353
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,930
So,does that make you...

354
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,700
Some kind of monk or something?

355
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,200
You know,celibate?

356
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,560
Man,I hope not.

357
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,560
Holy crap. oh,my god. jamie.

358
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,960
Guys,I'm --
I'm sorry.

359
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
I thought you guys were going out.

360
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,400
Lucy,it's -- it's
okay. - uh,listen...

361
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,130
You know what? I just.. 
- I came to borrow a bottle.

362
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,930
I kind of got something
going back at my...

363
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,930
Anyway,uh,you guys look really busy,

364
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,860
So I'm just gonna
get out of your hair.

365
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,430
Seriously,lucy,it's
been a crazy night.

366
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,560
Stay for a drink.

367
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,260
Yeah. stay for a drink.

368
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,160
You,fbi man --
what did I --

369
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,930
Shut up,okay,you know
what you did. what?

370
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,200
I know what you are.

371
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,830
I'm not anything. I just
like to play the casio.

372
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,700
Had time to grow the ear back,huh?

373
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,700
What?! ow!

374
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,200
Ow! ow! ow!

375
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,330
It's supposed to come off.

376
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,630
No,it's not!

377
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,360
Oh,that sounds awful.
jamie,honey,are you okay?

378
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,560
Oh,I am fine.

379
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,630
He didn't even touch me.

380
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,260
Dean,he just  blew right
in and fought him off.

381
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,430
Well,I didn't actually fly,

382
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,100
But I'm sure it seemed
that way at the time.

383
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,100
It was really,really something.

384
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,430
Jamie?

385
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,600
So,Dean,are you like
a black belt or what?

386
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,830
Well,I guess they train you

387
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,030
To fight at the academy or whatever.

388
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,760
Dean,what are you doing?

389
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,300
It's you,isn't it?

390
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,230
Oh,damn it!

391
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,630
What did you put in the drinks?!

392
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,930
­ That's all right.
I'll skin you myself.

393
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,030
And...scene.

394
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,660
Oh,come on.

395
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,230
She is beautiful,no?

396
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:10,760
3 Bride number three
from the first film.

397
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,760
She never got the
acclaim that she deserved.

398
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,360
Which is why I chose her shape,

399
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,230
Her form to move among
the mortals unnoticed,

400
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:28,060
To listen to the cricket
songs of the living.

401
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:34,830
That is when I discovered
my bride had been reborn

402
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,330
In this century.

403
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,100
­ I can't get over
what a pumpkin-pie-eyed,

404
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,130
Crazy son of a bitch you really are.

405
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,860
­  You're not dracula.
you get that,right?

406
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,960
Or even if you think you are dracula,

407
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
What the hell's up with the mummy?!

408
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,530
I am all monsters!

409
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,860
Life ain't a movie,you sorry sack of

410
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,100
Aah.

411
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,430
Life is small,

412
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,760
Meager,messy.

413
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,500
The movies are grand,simple,elegant.

414
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:21,000
I have chosen elegance.

415
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,960
You think "elegance"
is really the word

416
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,960
For what you did to
marissa or rick deacon

417
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,300
Or any of the others?!

418
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,900
But of course.

419
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,630
It is a monster movie,after all.

420
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,200
You do realize what happens

421
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,330
At the end of every monster movie?

422
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:46,400
Ah. but this movie is mine.

423
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,530
And in it,the monster wins.

424
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,830
The monster gets the girl.

425
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:01,360
And the hero,he's...electrocuted.

426
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,060
­ And tonight,jonathan harker,

427
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,430
You will be my hero.

428
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,360
Wait,wait,wait,wait.

429
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:31,700
Please,excuse me.

430
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,160
Good evening.

431
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,160
Uh...pizza delivery.

432
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,500
Ah,you've brought a repast.

433
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,830
Excellent.

434
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,430
Continue to be of such service

435
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,730
And your life will be spared.

436
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,630
Uh-huh.

437
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,460
That'll be $15.50.

438
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,630
Tell me... yeah?

439
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,560
...is there garlic on this pizza?

440
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,930
I don't know. did you order garlic?

441
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,230
No!

442
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,530
Then no.

443
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,330
Look,mister,I got four
other deliveries to make.

444
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,960
You want to just pay me
the money so I can go?

445
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Of course. yes.

446
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,260
But I have a coupon.

447
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,730
Dean,hey,listen,uh,ed is not our guy.

448
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,730
Um,I'm guessing you're
at home with jamie,

449
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,160
So just give me a cat1,okay?

450
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,360
Lucy.

451
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,660
You wake.

452
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,660
The gown,it suits your beauty.

453
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,030
Please,put it on.

454
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,360
Where am i?

455
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,530
What have you done with Dean?

456
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,730
Harker is resting elsewhere.

457
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,900
Please,put on the
gown and you may dine.

458
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,800
We are having pizza.

459
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,400
What?

460
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,760
What is wrong with you?

461
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,830
You made up lucy,right?
pretended to be my friend.

462
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,160
I needed to know if you were the one.

463
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,660
You could try talking to people!

464
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,930
But instead you become this?

465
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,130
The gown.

466
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,430
I don't want to play
your stupid game,okay?

467
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,060
I just,I just want to go home.

468
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,700
Put on the gown!

469
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,300
I-i scared you.

470
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,760
You were the only one
I don't want to scare.

471
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,230
­ I used to love the movies.

472
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,460
They aren't real.

473
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,860
You can't make them real.

474
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:53,930
"real" is being born this way.

475
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,330
Different.

476
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:01,960
"real" is having your
dad call you "monster" --

477
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,430
It's the first time you hear the word

478
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,760
And he tries to beat you
to death with a shovel.

479
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,630
Everywhere I ran,everywhere
I tried to hide,

480
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,260
People found me,dragged
me out and attacked me,

481
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,330
Called me "freak,"
called me "monster."

482
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,360
Then I found them.

483
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,960
The great monsters.

484
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,400
In their movies,they were strong.

485
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,160
They were feared.

486
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,960
They were beautiful.

487
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,300
And now I am like them.

488
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,860
Commanding.

489
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,630
Terrifying.

490
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,700
Lonely.

491
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,060
­ Was lonely.

492
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,060
Now I

493
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,560
I have you.

494
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,400
Ever think that maybe you're lonely

495
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,560
Because you kill people?

496
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,760
Or I kill people because I'm lonely.

497
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,130
Did you hear that?

498
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,800
What?

499
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,230
Dean?

500
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,360
Dean!

501
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,100
Oh,thank god. just
in the nick of time.

502
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,860
That guy was about
to frankenstein me.

503
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,760
Hey there,handsome.

504
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,460
Shut up!

505
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,560
Let's go.

506
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,060
You will never be van helsing!

507
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,530
And you,harker,now you die.

508
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,260
How 'bout now you shut the hell up?

509
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,700
Silver?

510
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:18,300
It was beauty that killed the beast.

511
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,830
No,mina,do not weep.

512
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,260
Perhaps this is how

514
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,030
Well,thank you,g-man.

515
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,130
You have been a great
service to your country.

516
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,130
Oh,yes,I'm very,very patriotic.

517
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,660
Bye.

518
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,360
Bye.

519
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,230
You guys saved my life,you know?

520
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,430
So,thanks.

521
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,130
I like her.

522
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,460
Feels good to be back
on the job,doesn't it?

523
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,630
Yeah,it does.

524
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,260
The hero gets the girl,

525
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,830
Monster gets the gank --
all in all,happy ending --

526
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,030
With a happy ending,no less.

527
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,760
Real classy,Dean.

528
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,960
Hey,all I'm saying is

529
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The shifter man had a point,you know?

530
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,230
It would be nice if
life was movie simple.

531
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,560
Although,if I was
turning life into a movie,

532
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,900
I wouldn't do this "Abbott and
Costello meet the monster" crap.

533
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,230
Yeah. no,I know what you'd pick.

534
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,400
No,you don't.

535
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,090
Yeah,I do.

536
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,260
No,you don't.

537
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,090
You don't. "porky's II."

538
