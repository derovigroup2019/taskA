Dean, they don't tell me much.

537
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,968
I know...

538
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,388
...our fate rests with you.

539
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,809
[VOICE BREAKING]
Well, then you guys are screwed.

540
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,398
I can't do it, Cass. It's too big.

541
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,235
Alastair was right. I'm not all here.

542
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,905
I'm not strong enough.

543
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,125
Well, I guess I'm not the man
either of our dads wanted me to be.

544
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,299
Find someone else.

545
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,844
It's not me.
