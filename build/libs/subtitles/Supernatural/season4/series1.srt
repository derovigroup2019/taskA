521
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,792
I thought you would be one of them.
I was wrong.

522
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:07,172
And what visage are you in now, huh?
What, holy tax accountant?

523
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,050
This? This is a vessel.

524
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,219
You're possessing some poor bastard?

525
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,222
He's a devout man.
He actually prayed for this.

526
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,893
Look, pal, I'm not buying what
you're selling. So who are you, really?

527
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,604
I told you.

528
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,064
Right.

529
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,902
And why would an angel
rescue me from hell?

530
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,739
Good things do happen, Dean.

531
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,327
Not in my experience.

532
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,622
What's the matter?

533
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,919
You don't think
you deserve to be saved?

534
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,507
Why'd you do it?

535
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,929
Because God commanded it.

536
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,351
Because we have work for you.
