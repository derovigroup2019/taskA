1
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:07,385
Look Sam, we save a lot of people,
but we just can't save them all.

2
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:09,171
I'm Meg.

3
00:00:11,758 --> 00:00:13,182
Ronald Reznick.

4
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:17,979
This is Special Agent
Victor Henrickson.

5
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,115
You're not gonna go to Hell.

6
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:24,527
Sic him, boys

7
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:32,640
Somebody help me!

8
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:00,522
Getting pretty slick there, Sam.

9
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:03,233
What the hell is going on around here,
Ruby?

10
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:09,698
- Who're you?
- Castiello.

11
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:12,332
I'm the one who gripped you tight
and raised you from perdition.

12
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:14,828
- I mean what are you?
- I'm an angel of the Lord.

13
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:37,183
Why would an angel
rescue me from Hell?

14
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:39,102
Because God commanded it.

15
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:42,207
Because we have work for you.

16
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,153
<i>Hey, it's Olivia.</i>

17
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:22,934
<i>I'm not in. Leave a message.</i>

18
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,449
<i>Olivia, it's Bobby.</i>

19
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,465
<i>Call me back, would you?
I got something big.</i>

20
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:28,953
<i>I could use your help.</i>

21
00:02:58,235 --> 00:02:59,235
You!

22
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:19,018
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:21,326
I'm so sorry.

24
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:32,526
Synchro: IceFre@k

25
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:39,045
Then tell me what else
it could have been.

26
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:41,807
Look, all I know is
I was not groped by an angel.

27
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:44,745
Look, why do you think this Castiello
would lie to you about it?

28
00:03:44,865 --> 00:03:46,180
Maybe he's some kinda demon.

29
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:47,258
Demons lie.

30
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:49,976
A demon who's immune
to salt rounds and devil's traps...

31
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,313
And ruby's knife?!

32
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:53,916
Dean, Lilith is
scared of that thing!

33
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:58,115
Don't you think if angels were real,
that some hunter somewhere

34
00:03:58,277 --> 00:03:59,664
would have seen one...

35
00:03:59,784 --> 00:04:00,993
At some point... ever?!

36
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,037
Yeah. You just did, Dean.

37
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,590
I'm trying to come up with a theory.
Okay? Work with me.

38
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,750
We have a theory.

39
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,851
One with a little less
fairy dust on it, please.

40
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,405
I'm not saying we know for sure.

41
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:13,902
- I'm just saying that I think we...
- Okay, okay.

42
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:17,087
That's the point. We don't know for sure
so I'm not gonna believe that this thing

43
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:19,721
is a freaking angel of the Lord
because it says so!

44
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,432
You two chuckleheads
want to keep arguing religion,

45
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:25,226
or do you want to come take
a look at this?

46
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:33,497
I got stacks of lore...

47
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:35,349
Biblical, pre-biblical.

48
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:37,475
Some of it's in damn cuneiform.

49
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:41,392
It all says an angel can snatch
a soul from the pit.

50
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:42,656
What else?

51
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:44,543
- What else, what?
- What else could do it?

52
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:46,528
Airlift your ass out of the hot box?

53
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:48,411
As far as I can tell, nothing.

54
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:53,600
- Dean, this is good news.
- How?

55
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,723
Because for once, this isn't just
another round of demon crap.

56
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:59,575
I mean, maybe you were saved
by one of the good guys, you know?

57
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:01,911
Okay. Say it's true.

58
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:03,989
Say there are angels.

59
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:06,031
Then what?
There's a God?

60
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:08,888
At this point,
Vegas money's on yeah.

61
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,908
- I don't know, guys.
- Okay, look.

62
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:13,565
I know you're not all choirboy
about this stuff,

63
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:15,883
but this is becoming
less and less about faith

64
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:17,749
and more and more about proof.

65
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:19,249
- Proof?
- Yes.

66
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:22,075
Proof that there's a god out there
that actually gives a crap

67
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:23,492
about me personally?

68
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:25,161
I'm sorry, but I'm not buying it.

69
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:26,329
Why not?

70
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,238
Because why me?

71
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:34,316
If there is a god out there,
why would he give a crap about me?!

72
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:36,106
I mean,
I've saved some people, okay?

73
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:39,133
I figured that made up for the stealing
and the ditching chicks.

74
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:41,888
But why do I deserve to get saved?
I'm just a regular guy.

75
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,098
Apparently, you're a regular guy
that's important to the man upstairs.

76
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:50,304
Well, that creeps me out.

77
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:53,959
I mean, I don't like getting singled out
at birthday parties, much less by...

78
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:55,037
God.

79
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:58,981
Okay, well, too bad, because I think
he wants you to strap on your party hat.

80
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:08,157
Fine. What do we know about angels?

81
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:17,255
Start reading.

82
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:20,844
You're gonna get me some pie.

83
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:27,911
Yes, Dean, I'll get the chips.

84
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:29,558
Dude.

85
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,553
When have I ever forgotten the pie?

86
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,409
Exactly.

87
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:39,770
I got to go.
Yeah, all right. Bye.

88
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:49,988
- Ruby.
- So, is it true?

89
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:51,329
Is what true?

90
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,332
Did an angel rescue Dean?

91
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:55,668
You heard.

92
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:00,339
Who hasn't?

93
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:02,620
We're not 100% sure, but I think so.

94
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:04,880
Okay.

95
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:07,815
Bye, Sam.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

96
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:09,678
- Wait. What's going on?
- Sam...

97
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:11,601
- They're angels.
- I'm a demon.

98
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:13,811
They're not gonna care
if I'm being helpful.

99
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:16,397
They smite first, and then
they ask questions later.

100
00:07:18,793 --> 00:07:20,610
- What do you know about them?
- Not much.

101
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:23,696
I've never met one,
and I don't really want to.

102
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:27,704
All I know is that they scare
the holy hell out of me.

103
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,453
Watch yourself, Sam.

104
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:32,976
I'm not scared of angels.

105
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:49,991
- Keep the engine running.
- Why?

106
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:52,228
- What's going on?
- I got a friend one state over...

107
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,230
Olivia Lowry.

108
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,770
I've been trying to reach her
for three days on this angel thing.

109
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,695
It's not like her to ignore
this many calls.

110
00:07:57,815 --> 00:07:59,649
Olivia Lowry...
A hunter, right?

111
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,692
Yeah. We're gonna go check on her.
You guys follow me.

112
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:05,404
- Scoot over.
- Yeah.

113
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:13,320
- Dude?
- Yeah?

114
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,754
Where's the pie?

115
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:20,258
Olivia?

116
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:32,748
Bobby?

117
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,524
Salt line.

118
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,254
Olivia was rocking the EMF meter.

119
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:05,559
Spirit activity.

120
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:09,092
Yeah... On steroids.

121
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:11,762
I never seen a ghost do
this to a person.

122
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,315
Bobby, you all right?

123
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:20,186
I called some hunters nearby...

124
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:22,064
- Good. We can use their help.
- Except...

125
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:24,567
They ain't answering
their phones either.

126
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,111
Something's up?

127
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,065
You think?

128
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:50,101
<i>Yeah, this is jed. I'm not around.
Uh, leave a message.</i>

129
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:53,012
<i>Jed, Dean Winchester again...
Friend of Bobby Singer's.</i>

130
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:55,980
<i>Look, we think something's happening.
We think it's happening to hunters.</i>

131
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,267
Just want to make sure you're okay.
Call me back.

132
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,071
Yeah, we're at Jed's.
It's not pretty.

133
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,117
He looks even worse than olivia.
What about you?

134
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:11,716
<i>I checked on Carl Bates and R.C.
Adams.</i>

135
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:14,261
They've redecorated...
In red.

136
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:18,366
What the hell is
going on here, Bobby?

137
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,902
Why did a bunch of ghosts suddenly
want to gank off-duty hunters?

138
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:22,638
I don't know, but until we find out,

139
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,521
you guys better get
your asses to my place.

140
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:25,987
We're on our way.

141
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,085
Hi, Sam.

142
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:40,318
It's been a while.

143
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,433
Hi, guys.
It's been a while.

144
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:46,394
So, how do we survive?

145
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:47,950
Henriksen.

146
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:50,023
Are you... Did you...

147
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:53,319
I didn't survive...

148
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:56,112
If that's what you're asking.

149
00:11:58,462 --> 00:11:59,491
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,076
I know you are.

151
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:02,910
Look, if we'd known
Lilith was coming...

152
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,044
You wouldn't have left half
a dozen innocent people

153
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:07,325
in that police station
to die in your place.

154
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:10,543
You did this to me.

155
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:15,423
It was your fault.
She was after you, and I paid the price.

156
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,217
You left us there to die!

157
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,984
Damn it, Bobby!
Pick up!

158
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:09,495
How you feeling, huh?
How many fingers am I holding up?

159
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,205
None.
I'll be fine, Dean.

160
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:12,916
- Henriksen?
- Yep.

161
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:14,494
Why?
What did he want?

162
00:14:14,614 --> 00:14:16,583
Revenge 'cause we got him killed.

163
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:19,839
- Well, we did, Dean.
- All right. Stop right there.

164
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:22,745
Whatever the hell is going on,
it's happening to us now, okay?

165
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:25,214
I can't get a hold of Bobby,
so if you're not thinking answers,

166
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:26,734
don't think at all.

167
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:03,200
I'll go.
You check outside.

168
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,143
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

169
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:02,977
Dean Winchester.

170
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:04,950
Still so bossy.

171
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:09,782
You don't recognize me?

172
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:17,141
This is what I looked like before
that demon cut off my hair

173
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:18,791
and dressed me like a slut.

174
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:29,427
Meg?

175
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:31,971
Hi.

176
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,996
It's okay.

177
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:42,228
I'm not a demon.

178
00:16:42,988 --> 00:16:46,075
- You're the girl the demon possessed.
- Meg masters.

179
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,880
Nice to finally talk
to you when I'm not,

180
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,202
you know, choking on my own blood.

181
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:57,682
It's okay.

182
00:16:57,802 --> 00:17:00,969
Seriously, i'm just a college girl.

183
00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:03,306
Sorry -- was.

184
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:09,121
I was walking home one night
and got jumped by all this smoke.

185
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,984
Next thing you know,
Im a prisoner...

186
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,432
In here.

187
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,320
Now, I was awake.

188
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:20,813
I had to watch

189
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,648
while she murdered people.

190
00:17:25,115 --> 00:17:26,569
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah?

191
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:29,363
So sorry you had me
thrown off a building.

192
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:37,413
- Well, we thought --
- No, you didn't think!

193
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,280
I kept waiting, praying!

194
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,280
I was trapped in
there screaming at you!

195
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,511
"Just help me, please!"

196
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:48,883
You're supposed to help people.
Why didn't you help me?

197
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:53,930
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying you're sorry!

198
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,402
- We didn't know.
- No...

199
00:18:08,738 --> 00:18:10,080
You just attacked.

200
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:13,366
Did you ever think
there was a girl in here?

201
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,701
No.

202
00:18:16,064 --> 00:18:19,606
You just charged in,
slashing and burning.

203
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:24,539
You think you're some kind of hero?

204
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:27,421
No, I don't.

205
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,314
You're damn right.

206
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,371
Do you have any idea what it's like

207
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,264
to be ridden for
months by pure evil...

208
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:41,362
... while your family has no idea
what happened to you?

209
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:46,148
We did the best we could.

210
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:49,944
- Are you scared, Bobby?
- We were scared, Bobby.

211
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:53,114
- When the monster came for us...
- And grabbed us tight.

212
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:56,242
- And we couldn't even scream.
- You were right there, Bobby.

213
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:59,453
- You were in the house.
- You were so close.

214
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:14,110
You could have saved us, Bobby.

215
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,790
- We're here, Bobby?!
- You walked right past that door.

216
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,182
- The monster had us.
- And you didn't find us.

217
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:23,811
And now they won't find you.

218
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,582
It wasn't just me, Dean.

219
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,236
I had a sister.

220
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,286
A little sister.

221
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:38,826
She worshiped me.

222
00:19:39,747 --> 00:19:42,109
You know how little
siblings are, right?

223
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,100
How they'll do anything for you.

224
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,463
She was never the Same
after I disappeared.

225
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,135
She just...

226
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,093
She just got lost.

227
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:01,676
And when my body was lying
in the morgue,

228
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:03,184
beat-up,

229
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:05,350
broken.

230
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:08,468
Do you know what that did to her?
She killed herself!

231
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,483
Because of you, Dean!

232
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,319
Because all you were thinking
about was your family,

233
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,571
your revenge, and your demons!

234
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:19,442
50 words of latin a little sooner,
and I'd still be alive.

235
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,078
My baby sister would still be alive.

236
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,723
That blood is on your hands, Dean!

237
00:20:29,843 --> 00:20:30,956
You're right.

238
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:45,142
Hold on, Bobby!
I'm coming!

239
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,380
Come on, Dean.

240
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,396
Did your brain get
french-fried in hell?

241
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:20,177
You can't shoot me with bullets.

242
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:22,072
I'm not shooting you.

243
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:31,689
Iron.

244
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:36,527
So, they're all people we know?
Not just know.

245
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:38,137
People we couldn't save.

246
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:41,844
Hey, I saw something on Meg.

247
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:43,915
Did she have a tattoo
when she was alive?

248
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,403
I don't think so.

249
00:21:45,523 --> 00:21:48,225
It was like a-a mark on her hand...
Almost like a brand.

250
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:50,880
- I saw a mark, too, on Henriksen.
- What did it look like?

251
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,105
Uh, paper?
Thanks.

252
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:02,136
That's it.

253
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,978
I may have seen this before.

254
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:09,930
We got to move.

255
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,366
Follow me.

256
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:13,167
Okay.
Where are we going?

257
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,149
Some place safe, you idiot.

258
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:12,254
- Is this...
- Solid iron.

259
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:14,350
Completely coated in salt.

260
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,043
100% ghost-proof.

261
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,798
You built a panic room?

262
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:21,386
I had a weekend off.

263
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:24,293
What?

264
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:27,531
You're awesome.

265
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:54,540
See, this is why
I can't get behind God.

266
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,162
What are you talking about?
If he doesn't exist, fine.

267
00:23:57,282 --> 00:24:00,107
Bad crap happens to good people.
That's how it is.

268
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:01,601
There's no rhyme or reason...

269
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:04,112
Just random, horrible, evil --

270
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:06,176
I get it, okay.
I can roll with that.

271
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:09,430
But if he is out there,
what's wrong with him?

272
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:11,974
Where the hell is he while all
these decent people

273
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,026
are getting torn to shreds?

274
00:24:14,528 --> 00:24:17,347
How does he live with himself?
You know, why doesn't he help?

275
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:24,614
I ain't touching this one
with at 10-foot pole.

276
00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:26,730
Found it.

277
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,047
- What?
- The symbol you saw...

278
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:31,295
The brand on the ghosts...

279
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,025
Mark of the witness.

280
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,600
Witness?

281
00:24:34,998 --> 00:24:37,072
- Witness to what?
- The unnatural.

282
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,711
None of them died what
you'd call ordinary deaths.

283
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:42,421
See, these ghosts...

284
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,340
They were forced to rise.

285
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,664
They woke up in agony.
They were like rabid dogs.

286
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:50,600
It ain't their fault.
Someone rose them...

287
00:24:51,748 --> 00:24:53,481
- On purpose.
- Who?

288
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:54,890
Do I look like I know?

289
00:24:55,601 --> 00:24:59,524
But whoever it was used a spell
so powerful it left a mark,

290
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:02,313
a brand on their souls.

291
00:25:03,978 --> 00:25:06,904
Whoever did this had big plans.

292
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:09,294
It's called
"the rising of the witnesses."

293
00:25:09,414 --> 00:25:11,483
It figures into an ancient prophecy.

294
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:12,603
Wait, wait.

295
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,735
What book is that prophecy from?

296
00:25:14,855 --> 00:25:17,735
Well, the widely distributed version's
just for tourists, you know.

297
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:20,264
But long story short --

298
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:21,669
Revelations.

299
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:25,649
This is a sign, boys.

300
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:30,511
- A sign of what?
- A sign of what?

301
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,522
The apocalypse.

302
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,131
Apocalypse?

303
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:54,851
As in Apocalypse Apocalypse?

304
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,968
The four horsemen, pestilence,

305
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,251
$5-a-gallon-gas apocalypse?

306
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:00,396
That's the one.

307
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,544
The rise of the witnesses is a...

308
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,714
- Mile marker.
- Okay, so, what do we do now?

309
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:08,534
Road trip.

310
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:11,201
Grand canyon, star trek experience.

311
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:12,931
Bunny ranch.

312
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,245
First things first.

313
00:26:15,714 --> 00:26:17,913
How about we survive our
friends out there?

314
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:18,787
Great.

315
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:21,859
Any ideas aside from staying in
this room until judgment day?

316
00:26:22,922 --> 00:26:24,587
It's a spell...

317
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:27,131
to send the witnesses back to rest.

318
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,413
- Should work...
- Should?

319
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:30,533
Great.

320
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:32,372
... if I translate it correctly.

321
00:26:32,492 --> 00:26:34,665
I think I got everything we need
here at the house.

322
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:37,354
Any chance you got everything
we need here in this room?

323
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:39,769
So, you thought our luck was gonna
start now all of a sudden?

324
00:26:41,574 --> 00:26:44,565
Spell's got to be cast over
an open fire.

325
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:48,569
- The fireplace in the library.
- Bingo.

326
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:54,152
That's just not as appealing as
a ghost-proof panic room, you know?

327
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:05,867
Cover each other.

328
00:27:06,903 --> 00:27:08,132
And aim careful.

329
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:11,804
Don't run out of ammo until I'm done,
or they'll shred you.

330
00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:14,051
Ready?

331
00:27:52,842 --> 00:27:54,054
Hey, Dean.

332
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,469
You remember me?

333
00:27:58,132 --> 00:27:59,515
Everybody on the floor now!

334
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:04,361
He's got the laser eyes.

335
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:05,664
Ronald, huh?

336
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,690
With the laser eyes?

337
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:11,361
I wish I could say
it's good to see you.

338
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,334
I am dead because of you.

339
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:16,173
You were supposed to help me!

340
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:22,878
If you're gonna shoot, shoot.
Don't talk.

341
00:28:42,141 --> 00:28:44,246
Upstairs, linen closet...
Red hex box. It'll be heavy.

342
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:45,366
Got it.

343
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,599
Kitchen.
Cutlery drawer.

344
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:04,038
It's got a false bottom.

345
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,837
Hemlock, opium, wormwood.

346
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,465
- Opium?
- Go!

347
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,339
You walked right by us

348
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,726
while that monster ate us all up.

349
00:29:18,846 --> 00:29:20,471
You could have saved us.

350
00:29:44,744 --> 00:29:47,206
You know what really
pisses me off, Sam?

351
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:50,960
You saw how I suffered for months.

352
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,713
I thought you must have
learned something.

353
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,735
I thought I died for something.

354
00:29:59,294 --> 00:30:01,512
But what you're doing
with that demon, Ruby...

355
00:30:05,745 --> 00:30:09,334
How many innocent bodies
has ruby burned through for kicks?

356
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:12,944
How many girls just like me?

357
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:15,773
And you don't sendher back to hell?!

358
00:30:16,311 --> 00:30:17,569
You're a monster!

359
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,390
I'm all right, Bobby!
Keep working!

360
00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:43,075
- Victor.
- Dean.

361
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,890
- I know.
- No. You don't.

362
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:49,476
It's my fault you're dead.

363
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:51,686
I left you behind.

364
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:55,012
And the minute I heard about
that explosion, I thought,

365
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:58,152
"I should have known."

366
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,571
I should have protected you.

367
00:31:03,783 --> 00:31:05,429
Not so fast.

368
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,816
You think you left and Lilith came

369
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:13,929
and we all died in a beautiful
blast of... white light?

370
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:16,515
If only.

371
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:20,299
45 minutes.

372
00:31:20,887 --> 00:31:23,521
- What?
- Over 45 minutes.

373
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:26,263
Lith said she wanted
to have some fun.

374
00:31:26,957 --> 00:31:28,951
The secretary was first.
Remember her?

375
00:31:29,071 --> 00:31:30,895
Nancy, the virgin.

376
00:31:31,654 --> 00:31:35,435
Lith filleted nancy's skin off
piece by piece,

377
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:38,275
right in front of us, made us watch.

378
00:31:38,435 --> 00:31:41,528
- Nancy never stopped screaming.
- No.

379
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,842
That was the last.

380
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:49,153
Victor...

381
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:54,708
Tell me how it's fair.
You get saved from hell...

382
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:55,876
I die.

383
00:31:56,036 --> 00:31:58,921
Why do you deserve
another chance, Dean?

384
00:32:08,257 --> 00:32:09,808
You all right?

385
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,310
No.

386
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:13,352
Let's go.

387
00:32:24,094 --> 00:32:27,089
Ronald. Hey, come on, man.

388
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:30,077
- I thought we were pals.
- That's when I was breathing.

389
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:32,037
Now I'm gonna eat you alive.

390
00:32:33,276 --> 00:32:36,373
Well... come on,
i'm not a cheeseburger.

391
00:33:57,212 --> 00:33:58,535
Cover Bobby!

392
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,868
Fireplace!

393
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,646
Excellent job with the witnesses.

394
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,467
You were hip to all this?

395
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:44,063
I was, uh, made aware.

396
00:35:45,469 --> 00:35:48,198
Well, thanks a lot for
the angelic assistance.

397
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:51,084
You know, I almost got my heart
ripped out of my chest.

398
00:35:51,204 --> 00:35:52,280
But you didn't.

399
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,325
I thought angels were
supposed to be guardians.

400
00:35:56,204 --> 00:35:57,493
Fluffy wings, halos --

401
00:35:58,347 --> 00:36:00,575
You know, Michael Landon.

402
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:01,873
Not dicks.

403
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:05,974
Read the bible.

404
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:08,802
Angels are warriors of god.

405
00:36:08,922 --> 00:36:11,968
- I'm a soldier.
- Yeah? Then, why didn't you fight?

406
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:15,613
I'm not here to perch
on your shoulder.

407
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:18,473
- We had larger concerns.
- Concerns?

408
00:36:19,717 --> 00:36:22,076
There were people getting
torn to shreds down here!

409
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,678
And, by the way, while
all this is going on,

410
00:36:24,798 --> 00:36:27,023
where the hell is your boss,
if there is a God?

411
00:36:28,392 --> 00:36:30,151
- There's a God.
- I'm not convinced.

412
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:35,904
'Cause if there's a God,
what the hell is he waiting for?

413
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:38,642
Genocide?
Monsters roaming the earth?

414
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:40,043
The freaking apocalypse?

415
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:43,015
At what point does he lift a damn finger
and help the poor

416
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,768
bastards that are stuck down here?

417
00:36:44,888 --> 00:36:46,922
- The Lord works --
- If you say "mysterious ways,"

418
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:49,529
so help me, I will kick your ass.

419
00:36:55,939 --> 00:36:57,603
So, Bobby was right...

420
00:36:59,378 --> 00:37:01,024
About the witnesses.

421
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:03,646
This is some kind of a...

422
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,247
- Sign of the apocalypse.
- That's why we're here.

423
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,162
Big things afoot.

424
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:11,393
Do I want to know
what kind of things?

425
00:37:11,513 --> 00:37:14,620
I sincerely doubt it,
but you need to know.

426
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:19,784
The rising of the witnesses
is one of the 66 seals.

427
00:37:19,944 --> 00:37:21,887
Okay. I'm guessing that's
not a show at seaworld.

428
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:26,298
Those seals are being
broken by Lilith.

429
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,832
She did the spell.
She rose the witnesses.

430
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:34,863
And not just here.

431
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:37,677
- 20 other hunters are dead.
- Of course.

432
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:40,145
She picked victims
that the hunters couldn't save

433
00:37:40,265 --> 00:37:42,330
so that they would barrel
right after us.

434
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:44,661
Lith has a certain sense of humor.

435
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:46,714
Well, we put those
spirits back to rest.

436
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,646
It doesn't matter.
The seal was broken.

437
00:37:49,857 --> 00:37:51,403
Why break the seal anyway?

438
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,026
You think of the seals
as locks on a door.

439
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:57,752
Okay.
Last one opens and...

440
00:38:02,607 --> 00:38:04,287
Lucifer walks free.

441
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:10,771
Lucifer?

442
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:15,125
But I thought Lucifer was just a story
they told at demon sunday school.

443
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,071
There's no such thing.

444
00:38:18,191 --> 00:38:20,803
Three days ago, you thought
there was no such thing as me.

445
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:26,956
Why do you think we're here walking
among you now

446
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:29,226
for the first time in 2,000 years?

447
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:32,942
To stop lucifer.

448
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:36,235
That's why we've arrived.

449
00:38:38,803 --> 00:38:39,849
Well...

450
00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:42,316
Bang-up job so far.

451
00:38:43,425 --> 00:38:45,503
Stellar work with the witnesses.

452
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,911
That's nice.

453
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:50,118
We tried.

454
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,879
And there are other battles,
other seals.

455
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,173
Some we'll win, some we'll lose.

456
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,925
This one we lost.

457
00:39:03,782 --> 00:39:07,166
Our numbers are not unlimited.

458
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,270
Six of my brothers died
in the field this week.

459
00:39:11,623 --> 00:39:15,515
You think the armies of Heaven
should just follow you around?

460
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,778
There's a bigger picture here.

461
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:27,026
You should show me some respect.

462
00:39:28,134 --> 00:39:29,747
I dragged you out of hell.

463
00:39:30,297 --> 00:39:32,220
I can throw you back in.

464
00:39:54,555 --> 00:39:55,731
You all right?

465
00:39:57,069 --> 00:39:58,530
What's wrong, Dean?

466
00:40:01,063 --> 00:40:02,291
So...

467
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:05,305
You got no problem believing in...

468
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,923
God and angels?

469
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,401
No, not really.

470
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:16,085
So, I guess that means that
you believe in the devil.

471
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:19,764
Why are you asking me all this?
