more than the dirt it takes to bury them.

514
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,494
You get to change things.

515
00:40:56,662 --> 00:41:00,623
Save people, maybe even the world.

516
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,877
All the while you drive a classic car
and fornicate with women.

517
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:07,505
This isn't a curse, it's a gift.

518
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:12,010
So for God's sakes, Dean,
quit whining about it.

519
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,679
Look around.

520
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,225
There are plenty of fates
worse than yours.

521
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,900
So are you with me?

522
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,487
You wanna go steam yourself
another latte?

523
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,323
Or are you ready to stand up...

524
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,577
...and be who you really are?

525
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,363
