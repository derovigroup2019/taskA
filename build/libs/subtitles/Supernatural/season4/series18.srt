00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,404
Even after the publisher went bankrupt.
But those books never came out.

174
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,156
Okay, wait. Heh, heh, heh.

175
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,617
This is some kind of joke, right?
Did that--?

176
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,869
Did Phil put you up to this?

177
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:44,291
Well, nice to meet you. I'm Dean Winchester
and this is my brother, Sam.

178
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,878
Last names were never in the books.

179
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,632
I never told anybody about that.
I never even wrote that down.

180
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,018
-Oh! Oh, you're still there.
-Yup.

181
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,104
-You're not a hallucination.
-Nope.

182
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,356
Well, there's only one explanation.

183
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,650
Obviously, I'm a god.

184
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,860
You're not a god.

185
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,320
How else do you explain it?

186
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,447
I write things and then they come to life.

187
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,449
Yeah, no, I'm definitely a god.

188
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,036
A cruel, cruel, capricious god.

189
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,581
The things I put you through.
The physical beatings alone.

190
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,957
We're still in one piece.

191
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,710
I killed your father.
I burned your mother alive.

192
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,547
You had to go through
the whole horrific deal again with Jessica.

193
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,174
-Chuck.
-All for what?

194
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,384
All for the sake of literary symmetry.

195
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:43,058
I toyed with your lives,
your emotions, for entertainment.

196
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,894
You didn't toy with us, Chuck, okay?
You didn't create us.

197
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,814
Did you really have to live
through the bugs?

198
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,149
Yeah.

199
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,235
-What about the ghost ship?
-Yes, that too.

200
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,404
I am so sorry.

201
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:01,493
I mean, horror is one thing,
but to be forced to live bad writing.

202
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,372
If I'd known it was real,
I would have done another pass.

203
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,667
-Chuck, you're not a god.
-We think you're probably just psychic.

204
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,168
No.

205
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,380
If I were psychic,
you think I'd be writing?

206
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,756
Writing is hard.

207
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,677
It seems that somehow
you're just focused on our lives.

208
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,095
Yeah, like laser focused.

209
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,015
Are you working on anything right now?

210
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,059
Holy crap.

211
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,602
What?

212
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,273
The latest book.

213
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,944
-It's, uh-- It's kind of weird.
-Weird how?

214
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,738
It's very Vonnegut.

215
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,616
Slaughterhouse-Five Vonnegut
or Cat's Cradle Vonnegut?

216
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,284
-What?
-What?

217
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,748
It's Kilgore Trout Vonnegut.

218
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,625
I wrote myself into it.

219
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,919
I wrote myself...

220
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,963
...at my house...

221
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,465
...confronted by my characters.

222
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,101
I'm in a Laundromat,
reading about myself in a Laundromat...

223
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,272
-...reading about myself. My head hurts.
-There's something this guy's not telling us.

224
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,318
"Sam tossed his gigantic darks
into the machine.

225
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,989
He was starting to doubt Chuck,
whether he was telling the whole truth."

226
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,324
-Stop it.
-"'Stop it,' Sam said."

227
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,910
Guess what you do next.

228
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,876
"Sam turned his back on Dean,
his face brooding and pensive."

229
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,003
I don't know how,
but this guy is doing it.

230
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,296
I can't see your face...

231
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,424
...but those are definitely
your brooding and pensive shoulders.

232
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,344
You just thought I was a dick.

233
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,892
Guy's good.

234
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,103
[CHUCK BREATHING HEAVILY]

235
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,560
So you wrote another chapter?

236
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,896
This was easier before you were real.

237
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,564
We can take it. Just spit it out.

238
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,902
-You especially are not gonna like this.
-I didn't like hell.

239
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,114
It's Lilith.

240
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,408
She's coming for Sam.

241
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,080
-Coming to kill him?
-When?

242
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,540
Tonight.

243
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,752
She's just gonna show up? Here?

244
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,381
See, it's, uh....

245
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,509
"Lilith patted the bed seductively.

246
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,595
Unable to deny his desire,
Sam succumbed...

247
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,932
...and they sank into the throes
of fiery demonic passion."

[SAM LAUGHS]

249
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,688
You're kidding me?

250
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,566
-You think this is funny?
-You don't? I mean, come on.

251
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,359
"Fiery demonic passion?"

252
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:25,613
-It's just a first draft. It's not--
-Wait, wait, wait. Lilith is a little girl.

253
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:32,787
No. This time, she's a "comely dental
hygienist from Bloomington, Indiana."

254
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,665
Great. Perfect.

255
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,211
So, what happens
after the fiery demonic whatever?

256
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,424
-I don't know. It hasn't come to me yet.
-Dean, look, there's nothing to worry about.

257
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,092
Lilith and me?

258
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,302
In bed?

259
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,431
-How does this whole psychic thing work?
-You mean my process?

260
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,308
Yes, your process.

261
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,477
Well, it usually starts with a headache.

262
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,563
A really bad headache.

263
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:04,485
Aspirin is useless,
so I drink until I fall asleep.

264
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,821
At first,
I thought it was just a crazy dream.

265
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,699
-First time you dreamt about us?
-It flowed.

266
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,326
It just-- It kept flowing.

267
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,120
It still does. I can't stop it, really.

268
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,497
-You can't seriously believe--
-Humor me.

269
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,419
Look, why don't we--? We just--

270
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,677
Take a look at these
and see what's what.

271
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,681
-You--
-Knew you were gonna ask for that. Yeah.

272
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,312
Dean, come on.

273
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,566
"The minivan accident wasn't that bad,
but Dean was still seeing stars.

274
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:48,696
He scratched absently
at the pink flower Band-Aids on his face."

275
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,782
-So?
-So I've seen you gushing blood.

276
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,953
You'd use duct tape and bar rags
before you'd put on a pink flower Band-Aid.

277
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,246
-What's your point?
-My point is this...

278
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,707
...all of this is totally implausible.
It's nuts.

279
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,378
He's been right about everything.
You think he'll ground out at first now?

280

"Dean slid behind the wheel
of his beloved Impala and drove off...

281
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,387
...the plastic tarp on the rear window
flapping like the wings of a crow."

282
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,222
-A tarp?
-Yeah, on the rear window.

00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,141
-You drive it like that.
-Might be wrong about the details.

-Doesn't mean he's wrong about the result.
-We just run?

285

for a face-to-face death match with Lilith.

OFFICER:
Hold up.

287
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,912
DEAN: What seems to be the problem?
-Bridge is out ahead.

288
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,581
-We're just trying to get out of town.
OFFICER: Afraid not.

289
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,166
-Is there a detour?
-Nope.

290
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:47,005
-No sideroad to the highway?
-To get to the highway, you cross that river.

291
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,174
-To cross the river, you take that bridge.
DEAN: How deep's the river?

292
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,927
Sorry. Afraid you boys have
to spend the night in town.

293
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,105
Hey, this could be a good thing.

294
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,776
If this is what puts us on the path to Lilith,
then all we gotta do is get off the path.

295
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,487
-How do you mean?
-It's a blueprint of what not to do.

296
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,532
-I mean, if the pages say that we go left--
-Then we go right.

297
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,910
Exactly. We get off book,
we never make it to the end.

298
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,912
It's opposite day.

299
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,958
It says that we get into a fight,
so no fighting.

300
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,209
No research for you.

301
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,087
No bacon cheeseburger for you.

302
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,757
No problem. I'll order something else.

303
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,301
-Hey.
-Hi, what's good?

304
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,761
Well, if you like burgers...

305
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,639
...Oprah's girlfriend said we have the best
bacon cheeseburgers in the country.

00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,975
-Really.
-I'll just have the Cobb salad, please.

307
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,982
I'll have the veggie tofu burger.

308
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,488
Thanks.

309
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,407
-This is ridiculous.
-Lilith is ridiculous?

310
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,744
-The idea of me hooking up with her is.
-Right.

311
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,121
Because something like that
could never happen.

312
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,130
Dean, for the first time,
we have warning that Lilith is close.

313
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,093
-So?
-So...

314
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,594
...we've got the jump on her.

315
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,515
If we know when she's coming,
we know where--

316
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,683
-This is an opportunity.
-Are you--?

317
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,148
It frustrates me
when you say such reckless things.

318
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,276
Well, it frustrates me
when you'd rather hide than fight.

319
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,119
Cobb salad for you.

320
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,579
And the tofu veggie burger for you.

321
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,498
Thank you.

322
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,377
It's not hiding, it's being smart.

323
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,631
It's picking your battles. This is a battle
that we are not ready to fight.

324
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,974
Oh, my God.

325
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,060
This is delicious.

326
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,979
Tofu is amazing.

00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,188
WAITRESS:
I am so sorry.

328
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,400

by mistake.

331
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,335
Hence, the Hooker Inn.

It's opposite day, remember?

333
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,141
What are you doing?

334
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,602
Couple of hex bags
ought to Lilith-proof the room.

335
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,062
What, I'm supposed to just hole up here
all night?

336
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,525
That's exactly what you're gonna do, okay?
And no research. I don't care what you do.

337
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:59,030
You can use the Magic Fingers
or watch Casa Erotica on pay-per-view.

338
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,703
