they're the ones that came for me?

173
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,663
-You know them?
-We were kind of in the same foxhole.

174
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,375
So, what were they, like,
your bosses or something?

175
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,670
-Try the other way around.
-Look at you.

176
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,382
-But now they wanna kill you?
-Orders are orders.

177
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,219
I'm sure I have a death sentence
on my head.

178
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:42,140
-Why?
-I disobeyed...

179
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,893
...which, for us,
is about the worst thing you can do.

180
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,561
-I fell.
-Meaning?

181
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,690
-She fell to Earth. Became human.
-Wait a minute, I don't understand.

182
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:56,029
-Angels can just become human?
-Kind of hurts.

183
00:10:56,197 --> 00:11:00,033
Try cutting your kidney out with
a butter knife. That kind of hurt.

184
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,536
I ripped out my grace.

185
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,708
-Come again?
-My grace. It's energy.

186
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,044
Hacked it out and fell.

187
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,714
My mother, Amy,
couldn't get pregnant.

188
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:19,594
Always called me her little miracle.
She had no idea how right she was.

189
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,181
So you just forgot that you
were God's little Power Ranger?

190
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,767
The older I got,
the longer I was human, yeah.

191
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,770
I don't think you appreciate
how completely screwed we are.

192
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:33,358
-Ruby's right. Heaven wants me dead.
-And hell just wants her.

193
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,737
A flesh and blood angel that you
can question, torture, that bleeds.

194
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,282
Sister, you're the Stanley Cup.
And sooner or later...

195
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,952
-...heaven or hell, they're gonna find you.
ANNA: I know.

196
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,789
And that's why I'm gonna get it back.

197
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,708
-What?
-My grace.

198
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,043
-You can do that?
-If I can find it.

199
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,588
So what? You're just gonna
take some divine bong hit.

200
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,467
-And shazam, you're Roma Downey?
-Something like that.

201
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,637
All right. I like this plan.
So where's this grace of yours?

202
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,933
Lost track. I was falling about
10,000 miles per hour at the time.

203
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:12,147
-Wait, you mean falling, like, literally?
-Yes.

204
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,942
Like the way a human eye can see?
Like a comet, maybe, or a meteor?

205
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,112
-Why do you ask?
-Here, in March '85...

206
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,490
...a meteorite vanished in the
night sky over Northwestern Ohio.

207
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,951
It was sighted nine months
before Anna was born.

208
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,412
And she was born in that part of Ohio.

209
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,291
-Pretty buff for a nerd.
-Look, I think it was Anna.

210
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,169
And here, same time,
another meteor over Kentucky.

211
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,338
-And that's her grace?
-Might be.

212
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:41,009
All right, just narrows
it down to an entire state.

213
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,428
Look, it's a start.

214
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,514
Sam, I'm sorry.

215
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,852
-For what?
-For bringing you this mess.

216
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,021
If I'd known,
I would've kept my trap shut.

217
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,775
-Well, we'll muddle through.
-Not this time.

218
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,943
You do not wanna get
between these armies.

219
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,614
It's Godzilla and Mothra. If one side
doesn't get us, the other one will.

220
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,992
So, what do you wanna do?
Dump Anna and run?

221
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,869
Forget it. Look...

222
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,790
-...I know angels freak you out--
-Forget angels. It's Alastair I'm scared of.

223
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,541
-Alastair?
-You met him.

224
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:18,213
Practically, the grand inquisitor
downstairs. Picasso with a razor.

225
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,217
And?

226
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:26,137
And you should pull him out
and throw him back in the pit.

227
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,058
If you weren't so out of shape.
Your abilities are getting flabby.

228
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,310
-Yeah, so how do I tone up?
-You know how.

229
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,896
You know what you gotta do.

230
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,360
-I'm not doing that anymore.
-Sam....

231
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,736
I said no.

232
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,073
Well, then you better pray
that Anna gets her groove back.

233
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,574
Or we're all dead.

234
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,060
Pamela get home okay?

235
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:20,191
Yeah, she said she was sorry.
It's just after last time, she....

236
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,444
This is just a little
too rich for her blood.

237
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,780
I don't blame her.

238
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,783
You guys should do the same.

239
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,619
Well, we're not that smart.

240
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,291
Can I ask you something?

241
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,381
What do they want me for?

242
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,468
-Why did they save me?
-I'm sorry.

243
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:52,432
The angels aren't talking about it.
And it was after I fell.

244
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,147
That's another question.

245
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,565
Why would you fall?

246
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,485
Why would you wanna be one of us?

247
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,113
-You don't mean that.
-I don't?

248
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,617
A bunch of miserable bastards.
I mean, eating, crapping...

249
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:14,954
-...confused, afraid.
-I don't know. There's loyalty.

250
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,749
Forgiveness. Love.

251
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,084
-Pain.
-Chocolate cake.

252
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,794
-Guilt.
-Sex.

253
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,340
Yeah, you got me there.

254
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,263
I mean it. Every emotion, Dean.
Even the bad ones.

255
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,351
It's why I fell.

256
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,189
It's why I'd give anything...

257
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,941
...not to have to go back.

258
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,694
Anything.

259
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,700
-Feelings are overrated, if you ask me.
-Beats being an angel.

260
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,996
How's that possible?
You guys are powerful and perfect.

261
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,541
You don't doubt yourselves.
Or God. Or anything.

262
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,211
Perfect. Like a marble statue.

263
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,381
Cold. No choice. Only obedience.

264
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,842
Dean, do you know how many
angels have actually seen God?

265
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,471
-Seen his face?
-All of you?

266
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,890
Four angels.

267
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,018
Four. And I'm not one of them.

268
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,979
That's it?

269
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,857
Well, then how do you
even know that there is a God?

270
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,736
We have to take it on faith,
which we're killed if we don't have.

271
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,115
Huh.

272
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:37,328
I was stationed on Earth 2000 years.

273
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,749
Just watching.

274
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,377
Silent.

275
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,379
Invisible.

276
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,590
Out on the road. Sick for home.

277
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,427
Waiting on orders from
an unknowable father...

278
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,221
...I can't begin to understand.
So don't tell me that--

279
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,764
[CHUCKLES]

280
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:01,185
-What is so funny? What?
-Nothing, sorry. It's just....

281
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,732
I can relate.

282
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,864
SAM:
Hey.

283
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,118
-Did you find something?
-I think so.

284
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,747
SAM: Union, Kentucky.
Found some accounts of a local miracle.

285
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:25,460
Yeah. In '85, there was
an empty field outside of town.

286
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,795
Six months later,
there was a full grown oak.

287
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,131
They say it looks a century old,
at least.

288
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,633
-Anna, what do you think?
-The grace.

289
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:37,388
Where it hit, it could have
done something like that. Easy.

290
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,641
So grace ground zero.
It's not destruction.

291
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,435
-It's....
-Pure creation.

292
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,077
[CHUCKLES]

293
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,329
What?

294
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,751
Nothing. It's just an angel
and a demon, riding in the back seat.

295
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,002
[CHUCKLES]

296
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,296
It's like the setup to a bad joke.

297
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,091
Or a Penthouse forum letter.

298
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,512
Dude, reality. Porn.

299
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,931
You call this reality?

300
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,027
It's beautiful.

301
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,531
It's where the grace touched down.
I can feel it.

302
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,703
-You ready to do this?
-Not really.

303
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,301
Anna, what are we even looking for?

304
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,314
It doesn't matter. It's not here.

305
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,066
Not anymore.

306
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,069
Someone took it.

307
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,584
DEAN: We still got the hex bags. I say
we head back to the panic room.

308
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,086
-What, forever?
-I'm just thinking out loud.

309
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,755
-You call that thinking?
-Hey, hey. Stop it.

310
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,924
Anna's grace is gone,
you understand?

311
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:41,179
She can't angel up and protect us.
We can't fight heaven and hell.

312
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,681
One side, maybe,
but not both. Not at once.

313
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,058
Guys, the angels are talking again.

314
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:50,521
-What're they saying?
-It's weird. Like a recording.

315
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,941
A loop. It says:

316
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:59,363
"Dean Winchester gives us
Anna by midnight, or...."

317
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,449
Or what?

318
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,744
"Or we hurl him back to damnation."

319
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,959
Anna, do you know of any weapon
that works on an angel?

320
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,713
To what? To kill them?

321
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,299
Nothing we could get to.
Not right now.

322
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,969
Okay, wait. I say we call Bobby,
we get him back from Hedonism....

323
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,721
Dean, what's he gonna tell us?

324
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,599
I don't know.
But we gotta think of something.

325
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,650
Hey. Holding up okay?

326
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,652
-Trying.
-Yeah.

327
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,946
Little scared, I guess.

328
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,659
So, Dean.

329
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,495
I just wanted to thank you.

330
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,081
-For what?
-Everything.

331
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,334
-You guys didn't have to help me--
-Hey.

332
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,797
Let's can the "thanks for trying"
speech, you know?

333
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,175
Participation trophies suck ass.

334
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,427
I don't know.

335
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,846
Maybe I don't deserve to be saved.

336
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,516
Don't talk like that.

337
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:13,020
I disobeyed. Lucifer disobeyed.

338
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,523
