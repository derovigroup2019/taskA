1
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:07,923
Sam, Dean, Pamela Barnes,
best damn psychic in the state.

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,551
Don't you recognize me?
But we were so close.

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,344
Alastair.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,763
Lilith is trying to break the 66 seals.

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,266
Lucifer will bring the Apocalypse.

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,935
I don't know when it happened.
The Sam I knew is gone.

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,063
The lies, the secrets.
What else aren't you telling me?

8
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,274
You're holding me back.
I'm a better hunter.

9
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,276
Stronger, smarter.

10
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,570
I can take out demons
you're too scared to.

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,614
I didn't mean the things I said.

12
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,534
- It was just the siren's spell talking.
- Of course. Me too.

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,578
- So we're good?
- Yeah, we're good.

14
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,714
Okay, okay. Now, come on. You tell me.
Now, why kick that field goal?

15
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,967
- Because it's called football.
- No, it's called fantasy football.

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,304
Those three points screwed me.
Seriously, you need to get a life.

17
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,930
- Yeah.
- I'm telling you.

18
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,183
Hey, guys. You got any change?

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,809
Sorry, pal.

20
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,312
- How about your wallets?
Hey, no- No problem.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,813
- Take it easy.
- The wallets!

22
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,273
- No problem.
- Hold on, man.

23
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,485
Jim!

24
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,154
Jim! Jim.

25
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,614
Call 911 now!

26
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,828
Come on.

27
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,335
Hey.

28
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,961
Jim, Don't move, man.

29
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,424
I feel okay.

30
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,760
You- You're not even bleeding.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,267
Give me a hand.

32
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,855
How are you even alive right now?

33
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,692
I don't know.

34
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,163
No, no, no, you're right,
it's definitely weird.

35
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,749
Okay, Bobby. Thanks. Ahem.

36
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,044
- What's up?
- Uh-

37
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,547
Bobby found something in Wyoming.

38
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,174
- A job?
- Maybe.

39
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,344
Small town, no one's died in the past
week and a half.

40
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,554
That so unusual?

41
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,682
Well, it's how they're not dying. Um-

42
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,309
One guy with terminal cancer
strolls out of hospice.

43
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,813
Another guy gets capped by a mugger,
walks away without a scratch.

44
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,149
Capped in the ass?

45
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,901
"Police say Mr. Jenkins
was shot in the heart...

46
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,529
...at point-blank range
by a 9 millimeter. "

47
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,365
And he's not a donut?

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,742
Locals are saying it's a miracle.

49
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,537
Okay.

50
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,249
It's gotta be something nasty, right?

51
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,501
Maybe people making deals
or something?

52
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,920
You think?

53
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,213
What else would it be?

54
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,756
I don't know.

55
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,594
All right. Get that to go.

56
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,222
Come on.

57
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,522
What?

58
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,110
- You want me with you?
- Why wouldn't I?

59
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,113
Ah, I don't know, I don't wanna be
holding you back or nothing.

60
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,034
Dude, I've told you a hundred times,
that was the siren talking, not me.

61
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,535
Can we get past this?

62
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,706
Yeah, we're past it.

63
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,294
Now, you two said you were bloggers?

64
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,713
Yes, sir. FlooredByTheLord. com.

65
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,965
All God's glory fit to blog.

66
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,347
People around town are saying
what happened to you was a miracle.

67
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,099
- It was, plain as day.
- How can you be so sure?

68
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,061
How else do you explain it?
The doctors can't.

69
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,814
There's a bullet in my heart.
It's pumping like a piston.

70
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,316
Well, how do you explain it?

71
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,653
What's that?

72
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,323
Look, honestly...

73
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,741
...I was nobody's saint.

74
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,993
Not exactly father of the year either.

75
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,870
Okay.

76
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,374
But when that guy shot me
and I didn't bleed a drop...

77
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,085
...I just knew the Lord
was giving me a second chance.

78
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,336
That so?

79
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,592
I had this feeling
like angels were watching over me.

80
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,805
I wouldn't expect you guys
to understand.

81
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,101
Well, we'll just have to try.

82
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,438
You wouldn't have happened to have swung
by a crossroads in the past week or so?

83
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,067
- No.
- Maybe you met someone?

84
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,152
With black eyes?

85
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,196
Or red?

86
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,699
Who'd you guys say you were again?

87
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,659
Never mind. Thank you for your time.

88
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,207
Hey.

89
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,583
Anything?

90
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,545
That cancer survivor?
He was clinically dead.

91
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,674
His wife pulled the plug and now he's
taking her out for their 20th anniversary.

92
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,509
- Any sign of a deal?
- No.

93
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,303
What about you? Find anyone dying?

94
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,013
Not since Cole Griffith.

95
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,016
He dropped 10 days ago.
It was the last death I could find.

96
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,184
So, what are you thinking?

97
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,397
- Maybe it is what the people say it is.
- Miracles?

98
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,151
Dean, our experience,
when do miracles just happen?

99
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,862
There's no deals.

100
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,740
There's, uh, no skeevy faith healers.

101
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,327
I mean, these souls
just ain't getting dragged into the light.

102
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,164
Maybe because there's no one around
to carry them.

103
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,751
What do you mean?

104
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:41,089
Well, Grim Reapers,
that's what they do, right, schlep souls?

105
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,425
- If death ain't in town-
- Then nobody's dying.

106
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,094
So, what, the local Reaper's on strike?

107
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,888
Playing the back nine?

108
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,598
I don't know, Sam.

109
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,392
Well, then let's talk to somebody
who might.

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,729
- Last I checked, Huggy Bear ain't available.
- No, dude, the kid.

111
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,439
The kid? The kid's a doornail.

112
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,774
Exactly.

113
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,943
If he was the last person to die,
then maybe he's seen something.

114
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,111
We should talk to him.

115
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,615
I love how matter-of-fact
you are about that.

116
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,784
Strange lives.

117
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,345
You sure this is gonna work?

118
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,223
No.

119
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,142
But if his spirit's around,
this should smoke him out.

120
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,562
What?

121
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,606
This job is jacked, that's what.

122
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,108
How so?

123
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,569
You want me to gank a monster
or torch a corpse?

124
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,154
Hey, pbbt, let's light it up, right?

125
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,489
But this?

126
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,951
If we fix whatever this is,
people will start dropping dead.

127
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,869
Good people.

128
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,747
Look, I don't want them to die either,
Dean.

129
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,291
But there's a natural order.

130
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,835
- You're kidding, right?
- What?

131
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,629
You don't see the irony in that?

132
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,674
You and me, we're like the poster
boys of the unnatural order.

133
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,509
All we do is ditch death.

134
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,179
Yeah, but the normal rules
don't really apply to us, do they?

135
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,727
We're no different than anybody else.

136
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,189
I'm infected with demon blood.

137
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,732
You've been to hell.

138
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,278
I know you wanna think of yourself
as Joe the Plumber, but you're not.

139
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,737
Neither am I.

140
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,532
Sooner you accept that,
the better off you're gonna be.

141
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,367
Ah, Joe the Plumber was a douche.

142
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,162
You gonna help me finish this?

143
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,082
Hey!

144
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,043
- What are you doing here?
- Uh-

145
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,962
Look, just take it easy.

146
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,714
What the hell is this?

147
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,717
Oh, this- This is not what it looks like.

148
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,428
Really?

149
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,388
Because it looks like devil worship.

150
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,142
What? No, no. This is not devil worship.

151
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,393
This- This is- This-

152
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,729
This is the-

153
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,483
I don't have a good answer.

154
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,694
Look, we're leaving.

155
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,572
You're not going anywhere...

156
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,285
...ever again...

157
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,579
...Sam.

158
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,586
Alastair.

159
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,589
I thought you got deep-fried,
extra crispy.

160
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,424
No.

161
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,927
Just the pediatrician I was riding.

162
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,305
His wife's still looking for him.

163
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,723
It's hilarious.

164
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,935
Anyway...

165
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,270
...no time to chat.

166
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,439
Got a hot date with death.

167
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,026
Dean!

168
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,955
You're stronger, Sam.

169
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,209
You been Soloflexing
with your little slut?

170
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,628
You have no idea.

171
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,904
How you doing?

172
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,948
I'm in pain, that's how I'm doing.

173
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,993
- I think I have a concussion.
- You want aspirin?

174
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,828
No, thanks, House.

175
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,416
So demons, huh?

176
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,668
Yeah. So much for miracles.

177
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,463
- What happened with Alastair again?
- I told you.

178
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,718
He tried to fling me or whatever
and it didn't work, so he bailed.

179
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,680
How come he couldn't fling you?
He chucked you pretty good last time.

180
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,268
Got no idea.

181
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,687
Sam, do me a favor.

182
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,482
If you're gonna keep your little secrets,
then I can't really stop you.

183
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,027
But just don't treat me like an idiot,
okay?

184
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,696
What? Dean, I'm not keeping secrets.

185
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,198
Mm-hm.

186
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,367
Whatever.

187
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,996
So did you go back
and Q&A the dead kid?

188
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,706
Didn't have to.

189
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,166
Bobby called.

190
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,459
He did some digging.

191
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,544
And?

192
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,713
He thinks I'm right.

193
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,256
Local Reaper's gone.

194
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,550
Not just gone, kidnapped.

195
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,177
By demons? Why?

196
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,055
Listen to this:

197
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,724
"And he bloodied Death
under the newborn sky.

198
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,727
Sweet to taste,
but bitter when once devoured. "

199
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,188
Swanky. What the hell does that mean?

200
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:52,400
Well, it's from a very obscure,
very arcane version of Revelations.

201
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,986
Which means what I think it means?

202
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,906
Basically, you kill a Reaper
under the solstice moon-

203
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,909
Tomorrow night, by the way.
- you got yourself a broken seal.

204
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,994
How do you ice a Reaper?
Can't kill Death.

205
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,163
I don't know. Maybe demons can.

206
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:09,250
Where are the angels is what I wanna know.
We could use their help for once.

207
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,586
It looks like we'll have
to take care of this.

208
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,923
We gonna just swing in and
save the friendly neighborhood Reaper?

209
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,426
- You got a better idea, I'm all ears.
- Dean, Reapers are invisible.

210
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:22,597
The only people that can see them
are the dead and the dying.

211
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,266
If ghosts are the only ones
who can see...

212
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,726
Yeah?

213
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,855
...then we become ghosts.

214
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,234
You do have a concussion.

215
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,111
Sounds crazy, I know.

216
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,113
It is crazy.

217
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,408
How?

218
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,205
I can't even begin to tell you
how crazy you two are.

219
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,085
Well, Pamela,
you're a sight for sore eyes.

220
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,589
Aw, that's sweet, Grumpy.

221
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,967
What do you say to deaf people?

222
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,137
Which one of you brainiacs
came up with astral projection?

223
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,681
Yo.

224
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,474
Of course. Chachi.

225
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,976
Chachi?

226
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,477
So let's be clear.

227
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,231
You wanna rip your souls
out of your bodies...

228
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,567
...and take a little stroll
through the spirit world?

229
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,776
Mm-hm.

230
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,529
Do you have any idea
how heavy-duty insane that is?

231
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,656
Maybe, but that's where the Reaper is,
so-

232
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,117
- So it's nuts.
- Not if you know what you're doing.

233
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,327
- You don't know what you're doing.
No.

234
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,830
- But you do.
- Yeah, I do.

235
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,416
And guess what?
I'm sick of being hauled...

236
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,502
...back into your angel-demon,
Soc-greaser crap.

237
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,881
I'd love to be kicking back with a cold one,
watching Judge Judy too.

238
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,467
- Nice. More blind jokes?
- You know what I mean.

239
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,763
We're talking the end of the world here,
okay?

240
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,518
No more tasseled leather pants,
no more Ramones CDs, no more nothing.

241
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,980
We need your help.

242
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,990
Tell me something, geniuses.

243
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:09,329
Even if you do break into the veil and you
find the Reaper, how you gonna save it?

244
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,872
With style and class.

245
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,125
You're gonna be
two walking pieces of fog.

246
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,085
You can't touch or move anything.

247
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,796
You'll be defenseless, hotshot.

248
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,382
I seem to recall a bunch of ghosts
beating the crap out of us.

249
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,551
Yeah, they had plenty of time
to practice.

250
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,471
Well, then I guess
we gotta start cramming.

251
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,890
Wow! Couple of heroes.

252
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,559
All right.

253
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,187
Lie down.

254
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,189
Close your eyes.

255
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,038
Okay, guys.

256
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,414
That's it.

257
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,874
Show time.

258
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,417
Ah!

259
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,421
Well, nothing like shooting blanks.

260
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,257
What's plan B?

261
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,359
Oh, I'm so feeling up Demi Moore.

262
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,238
All right, so I'm assuming
you're somewhere over the rainbow.

263
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,241
Remember, I have to bring you back.

264
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,454
I'll whisper the incantation in your ear.

265
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,419
You have got a great ass.

266
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,922
What'd she say? What'd she say?

267
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,474
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

268
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,809
That was wild.

269
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,652
Am I making you uncomfortable?

270
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,404
Get out of me.

271
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,366
You're such a prude. Come on.

272
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,123
We've been spooking this town
for hours.

273
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,209
And no demons, no black smoke.

274
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,129
I say we hit Victoria's Secret,
get our peep on, huh?

275
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,797
Hey, hey. Three o'clock.

276
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,675
Kid in the window.

277
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,762
Am I crazy or is he looking at us?

278
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,181
That's because we've seen him before.

279
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,516
- We have?
- Newspaper. Cole Griffith.

280
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,810
Last person to die in this town.

281
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,903
Cole?

282
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,657
It's Mom.

283
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,328
Your dad thinks I'm crazy.

284
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,040
Are you here?

285
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,669
A picture frame fell over.

286
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,380
I could've sworn it was you, baby.

287
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,966
Are you still here with me?

288
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,351
Oh, my God.

289
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,648
Sam! How are you doing that?

290
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,233
- Who are you?
Relax, Cole.

291
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,859
It's okay.

292
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,112
- How do you know my name?
- Look...

293
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,573
...this isn't gonna be easy to hear...

294
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,535
...but you're dead.

295
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,245
You're a spirit. Us too.

296
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,415
Yeah, thanks, Haley Joel.
I know I'm dead.

297
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,251
What do you want?

298
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,878
We just wanna talk.

299
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,880
About what?

300
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,600
I was outside all morning.

301
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,646
They tell you to be careful
when it's cold.

302
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,773
Cold air can cause an asthma attack?

303
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,028
Then I was in my room.

304
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,446
It happened so fast.

305
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,115
I called out for my mom,
but nothing came out.

306
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:19,287
Everything started spinning
and then I was just standing there...

307
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,414
...looking down at my body.

308
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,877
And that's when you saw the man?

309
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,130
Creepy old guy in a black suit.

310
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,717
Wanted me to go with him...

311
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,804
...but I didn't wanna go.

312
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,348
Reaper.

313
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,059
How'd you get rid of him?

314
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,935
I didn't.

315
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,645
The black smoke did.

316
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,481
Black smoke?

317
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,441
It was everywhere.

318
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,985
I hid in the closet.

319
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,489
And when I came out,
it was gone and so was he.

320
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,034
Do you know
where the black smoke went?

321
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,285
No.

322
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,496
But I know where it is.

323
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,668
- They're back.
- Who?

324
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,050
- Another Reaper.
- Hey!

325
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,053
Hey! Wait, we need to talk to you.

326
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,520
Dean.

327
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,855
Do I know you?

328
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,941
We go way back.

329
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,155
You don't remember me?

330
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,661
Honestly, if I had a nickel for every time
I heard a girl say that...

331
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,498
You're gonna have
to freshen my memory.

332
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,725
Tessa.

333
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,228
That's one of my names, yeah.

334
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,896
So you do know her.

335
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,650
From the hospital, after the accident.

336
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,068
The accident with Dad?

337
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,489
So this is the Reaper
that came after you.

338
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,116
Yeah.

339
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,493
Well, this was fun.

340
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,913
- Now, if you'll excuse me-
- Wait, wait, wait. You can't-

341
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,748
- You can't take the kid.
- Why?

342
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,335
Demons are in town, that's why.
They've already snatched your Reaper pal.

343
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,421
- Kid knows where.
- So?

344
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,755
So you should shag ass.

345
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,675
For all we know, they could try
and snatch you too.

346
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,303
Except that this town is off the rails.

347
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,805
And someone has to set it straight.

348
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,308
Yeah, we understand that.

349
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:49,687
- But these are special circumstances.
- What, your whole angel-demon dance-off?

350
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,106
I could care less.

351
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,774
I just wanna do my job.

352
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,776
Right. We wanna help you do your job.

353
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,653
- So if you would just bail town-
- No.

354
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,573
Well, then could you hold off
until we fix this?

355
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,035
Please.

356
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,373
All right, but just so we're clear,
when I start reaping again...

357
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,250
...I'm starting with the kid.

358
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,713
Understood.

359
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,382
I'll find him.

360
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,219
Wait, wait, wait. What-?

361
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,262
What are you gonna say to him?

362
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,349
Whatever I have to.

363
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,215
This all must be pretty overwhelming,
huh?

364
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,593
Pretty scary too.

365
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,472
The worst is my mom.

366
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,643
Must be hard seeing her like this.

367
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,482
She's always coming in here...

368
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,234
...talking to me...

369
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,319
...telling me how sad she is.

370
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:26,534
I knock some stuff over to let her know
I'm here, but she only gets sadder.

371
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,743
Yeah.

372
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,331
You might wanna ease up
on the flying soccer balls.

373
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,213
I'm not telling you where the smoke is.

374
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,510
Hey.

375
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,597
What if I told you
that if you helped me...

376
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,518
...you wouldn't have to leave here ever?

377
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,104
What about the one downstairs?

378
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,315
Tessa? Oh, she wouldn't bother you.

379
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,067
No Reaper would.

380
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,822
You could just stay here with your family
for as long as you wanted.

381
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,825
You can do that?

382
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,411
Yeah, you bet I can do that.

383
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,748
You swear?

384
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,501
I swear.

385
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,214
I'll tell you, life is funny.

386
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,091
What do you mean?

387
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,427
You and me, together again.

388
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,056
Are you-?
Are you making a move on me?

389
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,100
You're the one that got away, Dean.

390
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,104
You'd be surprised
how little that happens to me.

391
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,818
Can I tell you something
between you and me?

392
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,570
Who am I gonna tell?

393
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,078
After our little, uh, experience...

394
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,290
...for that whole year...

395
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:01,212
...I felt like I had this hole in my gut.

396
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,506
Like I was missing something.

397
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,801
I didn't know what.

398
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,303
But you know what it was?

399
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,056
It was you.

400
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,560
The pain of losing my father...

401
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,562
...and Sammy.

402
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,815
I just-

403
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,610
I wish I'd gone with you for good.

404
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,408
But I guess things are different now.

405
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,827
What?

406
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,829
The angels on your shoulder?

407
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,915
So you know about that, huh?

408
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:43,212
Well, hey, don't get me wrong. Most
of the ones I've met are dicks with wings.

409
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,381
But still...

410
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,677
You know, I've done things.

411
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,013
Horrible things.

412
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,146
And someone upstairs still decided
to give me a second chance.

413
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,941
It just makes me feel...

414
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,528
I don't know.

415
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,780
Uh-huh.

416
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,910
Hey, guys.

417
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,747
Hey, Cole.

418
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,042
I'm Tessa. I'm not going to hurt you.

419
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,004
It's okay, Cole.
Just tell them what you told me.

420
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,301
I saw the black smoke at my funeral.

421
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,094
At the cemetery?

422
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,555
At the funeral home.

423
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,474
It was everywhere.

424
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,687
- Are you doing that?
- No.

425
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,822
Tessa?

426
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,199
Cole, are you okay?

427
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,619
- How are we supposed to fight that?
- Learn some ghost moves?

428
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,704
By tonight?

429
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,998
Yeah, sure, I'll meet you back
at Mr. Miyagi's.

430
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,708
Who's Mr. Miyagi?

431
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,300
It won't move
if you don't concentrate.

432
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,093
I am concentrating.

433
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,602
Here we go, baby.

434
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,354
You pull a muscle?

435
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,690
All right, Yoda, let's see what you got.

436
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,919
Dude! You are so Amityville.

437
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,088
This isn't even the good stuff.

438
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,969
If you wanna hit something,
you gotta get mad.

439
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,637
Yeah, got it.

440
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,347
Now you try. Hit me.

441
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:02,810
Ah, I think I'll stick to just
picking on somebody my own size.

442
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,438
Hit me as hard as you can.

443
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,357
I won't do Fight Club with a 12-year-old.

444
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,694
All right, cut it out.

445
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,903
Make me.

446
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,705
Whoa, whoa, you gotta teach us that.

447
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,965
Place looks like New Jack City.

448
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,675
Can nobody see this?

449
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,261
Maybe it's demon invisible ink.

450
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,554
Only see it in the veil.

451
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,598
Any idea what it's for?

452
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,225
We'll find out.

453
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,467
Dude, check me out.

454
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,327
Well, you know, this ghost thing,
it's kind of rad.

455
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,338
It's iron.

456
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,847
Boys.

457
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,310
Find the place okay?

458
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,678
Rock salt's not so much fun anymore,
is it?

459
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,015
Alastair.

460
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,059
You bastard.

461
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,770
Well, go on.

462
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,607
Why don't you try some of your mojo
on me now, hotshot?

463
00:28:56,276 --> 00:29:00,154
It's hard to get it up
when you're not wearing your meat, huh?

464
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,948
- Go to hell.
- Oh, if only I could.

465
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:07,953
But they just keep sending me back up
to this Arctic crap hole.

466
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,331
- To kill Death?
- No, to kill Death twice.

467
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,167
It takes two to break a seal.

468
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,254
I figured another one would show up,
you know.

469
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,758
They're like lemmings.

470
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,720
By the way...

471
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,766
...it's good to see you again, Dean.

472
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,312
You can shoot us all you want,
but you can't kill us.

473
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,690
Ah.

474
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,609
That so?

475
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,720
Anywho...

476
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,890
...moon's in the right spot.

477
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,392
The board is set.

478
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,062
Let's get started, shall we?

479
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,022
You gonna kill a Reaper with that?

480
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,526
It's a little on the nose, don't you think?

481
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,194
Is it?

482
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,780
An old friend lent it to me.

483
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,158
You know, he doesn't really ride
a pale horse.

484
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,328
But he does have three amigos.

485
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,498
And they're just jonesing
for the Apocalypse.

486
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:44,341
It pays to have friends in low places.

487
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,926
Don't you think?

488
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,802
No.

489
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,848
Stop!

490
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,742
I know you're here.

491
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,996
What's the matter,
you reeking son a bitch?

492
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,372
You afraid of a skirt?

493
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,936
Son of a bitch.

494
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,373
Bye-bye.

495
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,254
- Where's your brother?
- I'll find him. You get out of here.

496
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,139
Oh.

497
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,062
Pamela.

498
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,425
- What's so funny?
- I can't die.

499
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,843
Not in this town.

500
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,678
Look.

501
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,807
Pamela.

502
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,767
Quit your worrying, Grumpy.

503
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,562
- How about you make me a drink, huh?
- You need a doctor.

504
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,981
Make me a drink, Sam.

505
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,326
You can't run, Dean.

506
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,414
Not from me.

507
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:09,463
I'm inside that angsty little noggin
of yours.

508
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,390
What the hell?

509
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,642
Guess again.

510
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,108
What just happened?

511
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,652
You and Sam just saved a seal.

512
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,947
We captured Alastair.

513
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,326
- Dean, this was a victory.
- Well, no thanks to you.

514
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,703
What makes you say that?

515
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,874
You were here the whole time?

516
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,001
Enough of it.

517
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,171
Well, thanks for your help
with the rock salt.

518
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,508
That script on the funeral home,
we couldn't penetrate it.

519
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,719
That was angel-proofing.

520
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,473
Why do you think I recruited you and
Sam in the first place?

521
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,143
You recruited us?

522
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,189
That wasn't your friend Bobby
who called, Dean.

523
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,858
It wasn't Bobby
who told Sam about the seal.

524
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,528
That was you.

525
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,157
If you want our help,
why the hell didn't you just ask?

526
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,035
Because whatever I ask...

527
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,539
...you seem to do the exact opposite.

528
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,709
What now? People in this town,
they just gonna start dying again?

529
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,378
Yes.

530
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,880
These are good people.

531
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,217
Don't you think
you can make a few exceptions?

532
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,594
To everything, there is a season.

533
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,681
You made an exception for me.

534
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,436
You're different.

535
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,945
Dean?

536
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,198
I could use your help.

537
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,131
Hey, Cole.

538
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,306
Tell your brother thanks for nothing.

539
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,268
Look at her, Cole.

540
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,689
Do you see how unhappy she is?

541
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,608
That's why I wanna stay with her.

542
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,823
As long as she can feel you,
she'll be in pain.

543
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,493
Because she can't let go.

544
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,664
Because you won't let go of her.

545
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,461
Why won't anybody tell me
what's on the other side?

546
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,504
Maybe nobody wants to ruin the surprise.

547
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,798
That's not an answer.

548
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,343
She won't answer you, Cole.

549
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,221
Reapers never do.

550
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,932
But trust me.

551
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,977
Staying here is a whole lot worse
than anything over there.

552
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,145
Why?

553
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,982
Because one day,
your family will be gone.

554
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,527
And there'll be nothing left here for you.

555
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,824
- It's okay to be scared.
- I'm not scared.

556
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,118
We're all scared.

557
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,495
That's the big secret.

558
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,831
We're all scared.

559
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,336
Are you coming?

560
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,132
Oh, I'm sure I'll be there
sooner than you think.

561
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,047
Look out for that boy.

562
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,217
Look out for yourself, Dean.

563
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,844
What do you mean?

564
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,556
I've been around death...

565
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,558
...from the get-go.

566
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,601
You know what I see most?

567
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,730
Lies.

568
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,026
"He's in a better place. "

569
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,028
"At least they're together now. "

570
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,780
You all lie to yourselves, Dean.

571
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,033
Because like you said...

572
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,578
...deep down, you're all scared.

573
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,789
Stop lying to yourself, Dean.

574
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,000
What?

575
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,211
The angels have something good
in store for you.

576
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,130
A second chance.

577
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,381
Really?

578
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,428
Because I'm pretty sure...

579
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,804
...deep down...

580
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,225
...you know something nasty
is coming down the road.

581
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,688
Trust your instincts, Dean.

582
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,734
There's no such thing as miracles.

583
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,445
What are you saying?

584
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,258
Hey.

585
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:51,137
We just gotta talk to Tessa, get her to
hold off reaping until we get you better.

586
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,306
I'm pretty sure she started up again.

587
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,857
What happened?

588
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,735
Dean, where's Tessa?

589
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,654
She's-

590
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,615
Pamela...

591
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,492
- ... I'm so sorry.
- Stop.

592
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,953
- You don't deserve this.
Yeah, I don't.

593
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,667
I told you I didn't want
anything to do with this.

594
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,670
Do me a favor?

595
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,172
Tell that bastard Bobby Singer...

596
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,135
...to go to hell for ever introducing me
to you two in the first place.

597
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,221
Take it easy, Pamela.

598
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,976
If it's any consolation,
you're going to a better place.

599
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,688
You're lying.

600
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,191
But what the hell, right?

601
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,694
Everybody's gotta go sometime.

602
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,950
Come here.

603
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,543
I know what you did to that demon, Sam.

604
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,005
I can feel what's inside of you.

605
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,384
If you think you have good intentions...

606
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,927
...think again.

607
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,316
Pamela?

608
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,447
Pamela!

609
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,455
What did she say to you?
