1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,998
Angels butchering angels.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,768
No one will survive this war.
It's madness.

3
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:09,937
It's Bartholomew.

4
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:11,731
Haven't I always said
that angels are dicks.

5
00:00:11,732 --> 00:00:12,798
What is that?

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,400
It's, uh, Kevin Tran.

7
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:16,469
He was a good,
straight-"A" kid,

8
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:19,572
and then he got sucked in to
all of this -- this angel crap

9
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:20,740
and became a Prophet.

10
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:21,741
I don't want to be a Prophet.

11
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:22,992
Hi, Mom.

12
00:00:22,994 --> 00:00:24,527
Oh!

13
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:26,863
You tortured me.
I torture all my friends.

14
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:29,031
You killed my mom!
Did I?

15
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:31,213
Man, we told you not
to talk to Crowley, okay?

16
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:32,035
He messes with your head.

17
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:34,987
Here's the first name
on your to-do list.

18
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:36,155
No!

19
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:38,491
And there's no way
that Kevin's

20
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:41,461
getting out of this intact,
is there?

21
00:00:41,463 --> 00:00:43,546
You're gonna
have to trust me.

22
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:46,883
I always trust you.

23
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:49,852
And I always end up screwed.

24
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:53,189
You didn't save me for me.
You did it for <i>you.</i>

25
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:54,941
You didn't
want to be alone.

26
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:59,362
If the situation were reversed
and <i>I</i> was dying,

27
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:01,697
you'd do the same thing.

28
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,652
No, Dean.

29
00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:08,354
I wouldn't.

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,227
? There's danger out tonight

31
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,445
? the man is --

32
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,283
Sam!

33
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:56,886
Dean?

34
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,930
Dean?

35
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,850
So...

36
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:01,851
Yep.

37
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:03,736
Bunker's haunted.

38
00:03:03,738 --> 00:03:07,738

40
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,664
How is this possible?

41
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,784
I thought you said this was
the safest place on the planet.

42
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:22,287
Look, I know
nothing got in.

43
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:25,123
I mean, the bunker is warded
and sigiled from top to bottom.

44
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,593
There's no way something came in
from the outside.

45
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:31,296
Okay, so whoever's haunting us
died here.

46
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:34,016
What,
dead man of letters?

47
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:36,435
No, that doesn't track.

48
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:39,137
I mean,
we're the first people

49
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:40,656
to occupy this place
in 50 years.

50
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:42,808
Why would a ghost wait so long
to get its spook on?

51
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,244
Must have been
a more recent death.

52
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:46,946
No.

53
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,833
How can you be so sure?

54
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,585
Because I burned his body
myself, okay?

55
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:54,319
It's not him.

56
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:55,454
Okay, so you cremated him.

57
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:57,489
We cremated Bobby, too,
and he came back.

58
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:00,859
Sam, I'm telling you --
this ghost, it's not Kevin.

59
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:09,718
Kevin?

60
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:12,221
Ooh.

61
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:16,976
We commit her body
to the ground,

62
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,362
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust,

63
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:21,847
with a clear and certain hope

64
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:23,949
of resurrection
into the eternal life,

65
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:25,784
according to
the mighty working,

66
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:29,038
whereby he is able to subdue
all things unto himself.

67
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,125
<i>In ne patris, et filii,</i>
<i>et spiritus sancti.</i>

68
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:34,576
Yea, though I walk

69
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:36,578
through the valley
of the shadow of death,

70
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,164
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me, Lord.

71
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:42,334
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:44,303
Please, she was my friend!
Who?

73
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:46,722
The dead human or the angel who
was killed while possessing her?

74
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:48,307
The angel. Rebecca?

75
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:50,059
Rebecca
had a lot of friends.

76
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:53,095
Friends like Metatron.

77
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:54,063
Where is he?!

78
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:55,230
You're looking
in the wrong place.

79
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:58,233
Rebecca and Metatron
<i>were</i> friends.

80
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,653
That was a long time ago.

81
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:03,055
Had no contact
since the fall.

82
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:08,226
Naomi, Metatron,
heavenly battles, politics --

83
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:09,495
she gave it up.

84
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,180
All of it.

85
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:13,499
Rebecca taught us
the angels have lost touch

86
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:15,034
with our true mission.

87
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:16,669
What do you mean by "us"?

88
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,070
The penitents.

89
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:19,588
Her followers.

90
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:23,075
Another faction.

91
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:25,127
Not like the others.

92
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:27,212
We don't make war.

93
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:29,682
We live humbly
among these humans.

94
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:33,886
Or we did.

95
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:36,588
He killed
all the others.

96
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,007
And he killed her.

97
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:40,092
Who did?

98
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:42,978
Who else?

99
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,629
The monster.

100
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:46,465
Bartholomew.

101
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:55,574
Anything?

102
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:57,326
Eh, a couple of dings.

103
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:00,913
A little EMF activity,
but mostly...silence.

104
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:02,948
So, he's back
in the veil.

105
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,167
I guess so.

106
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:07,152
Fumbling
to break through.

107
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:08,320
I mean,
you got to figure

108
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:09,905
it took Bobby months
to make contact.

109
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:11,823
Kevin's only...

110
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:13,492
He's new at this.

111
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:15,511
Right.

112
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:17,713
All right, you're up.

113
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:37,282
Kevin?

114
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:44,773
Kevin.

115
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:53,465
All right, I can't do this.

116
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:56,385
Coffee-buzzing,
bump-in-the-night crap.

117
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:01,890
I got serious things
to say to you, okay?

118
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:03,976
And I'm not gonna say them
to this.

119
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:13,685
Kevin, I'm sorry.

120
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:17,689
You did not choose this life.

121
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,560
You busted your ass,

122
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:25,897
you lost everything,
everyone you've loved...

123
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:28,733
And your reward?

124
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:32,404
Getting killed...

125
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,623
On my watch.

126
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:42,314
If I...

127
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,921
It was on me.

128
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:52,024
It was my fault, and...

129
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:54,860
And there's nothing I can do
to make that right.

130
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:56,895
I am so sorry.

131
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:02,434
Hey, did you see that?

132
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:05,103
The -- the lights were...

133
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:08,940
No, this is not happening.

134
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:11,293
Didn't spend months struggling
to break through the veil

135
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:13,595
just to get stuck
listening to Dean Winchester

136
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:14,946
having a self-pity session.

137
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:17,382
Didn't hear enough of those
when I was alive.

138
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:18,617
Kevin?

139
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:23,121
You can see me?

140
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,960
Hey,
take it easy, Kevin.

141
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:30,433
You might not hold this
form for too long, okay?

142
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,147
I-it takes a while.

143
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:32,764
Then we should talk fast.
Wait, wait, wait.

144
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:34,182
Why aren't you in --
in heaven?

145
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:36,435
I mean, if anybody deserves
an express pass to paradise --

146
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:38,604
I couldn't.
I can't.

147
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:39,688
No one can.

148
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,940
Heaven's
closed for business.

149
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:44,443
Everyone who's died
since the angels fell

150
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:47,496
are just stuck
inside the veil, waiting.

151
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:48,697
And it's bad in here.

152
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:50,916
Like
DMV-line-times-infinity bad.

153
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:54,586
Well, I mean,
what can we do?

154
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:56,705
I need a favor --
big one.

155
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:57,789
Okay.

156
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,759
Find my mother.

157
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:02,210
Kevin.

158
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:04,997
Crowley only told you
she was alive to mess with you.

159
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,882
I'm not going off his word.

160
00:09:06,884 --> 00:09:08,684
All right?
I have my own sources.

161
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:11,720
It's crowded
in the veil.

162
00:09:11,722 --> 00:09:14,690
All of us are stuck
near the sites of our deaths.

163
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:17,309
But I've been able to pass
messages spirit to spirit.

164
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,945
I made contact
with another new arrival.

165
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:23,014
She said she saw my mom
just a week ago, alive.

166
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:24,349
Okay, this --
this spirit

167
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,351
that you're playing
ghost telephone with,

168
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:28,353
I mean, what do you even know
about her?

169
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:29,354
Her name's Candy.

170
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,573
Says she's in a forest
in Wichita.

171
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:35,193
Candy?

172
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:36,996
Long-distance communication
within the veil --

173
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:38,530
it's not ideal.

174
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:41,249
That's why I need you
to go there, summon her,

175
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:44,086
see what else she knows.

176
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:46,204
You say
you want to make it right?

177
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:47,872
This is how.

178
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:00,402
Where did your friend go
in such a hurry?

179
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:03,021
You're too late.
He's gone.

180
00:10:03,023 --> 00:10:05,273
Castiel?

181
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:08,927
Our boss has been looking
for you.

182
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:24,759
All right,
that's the trestle.

183
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:27,262
Candy said her spirit
was stuck nearby.

184
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:28,513
She died here?

185
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:29,397
Yeah.

186
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,067
Dude, what got her?
A bear?

187
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:34,653
I'm still stuck on the fact
that we're trying to summon

188
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,404
a ghost named Candy.

189
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:38,106
You know,
just 'cause Kevin said

190
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:40,275
he heard his mom is alive
doesn't mean she --

191
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:43,161
Hey, we at least owe it
to the kid to try, right?

192
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:46,665
What'd you bring?

193
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,667
Well, she's only been dead
a week, right?

194
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:50,669
So I figured
she could use

195
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:53,338
as much help
as she can get, so...

196
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,042
Really?

197
00:10:57,044 --> 00:10:58,793
Whatever works.

198
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:10,138
How much longer?

199
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,974
You have someplace to be?

200
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:24,536
His blade.

201
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:30,658
Standard security protocol.

202
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,211
Can't be too careful
these days.

203
00:11:33,213 --> 00:11:35,797
Hello, Bartholomew.

204
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:40,284
Castiel.

205
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,875
It has been too long.

206
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:53,314
You feel that?

207
00:11:53,316 --> 00:11:57,268
I think I felt
a chill.

208
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,987
Yeah.

209
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:01,806
It's 'cause it's cold.

210
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:06,361
Crowley, it's Dean.

211
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:09,981
Call me
when you get this.

212
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:11,366
Really, Dean?

213
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:12,417
What?

214
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:14,419
That's your third
unanswered voicemail.

215
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:17,756
You ever think maybe
he's just not that into you?

216
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:21,042
Well, he is our last
confirmed link to Ms. Tran.

217
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:23,161
Yes,
he is a flaming douche,

218
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:25,096
but at least we know
he's real,

219
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:28,383
which is more than we can say
for this Candy no-show.

220
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:43,898
Candy?

221
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,416
Are -- are you there?
Is that you, Candy?

222
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:47,535
<i>Hello?</i>

223
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:50,405
<i>Hello?</i>

224
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:53,858
Madness, wasn't it?

225
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,262
A puny force of 20
behind enemy lines,

226
00:12:57,264 --> 00:13:00,815
launching an incursion against
Raphael and his loyalists.

227
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:02,901
It was
a calculated risk.

228
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:05,203
I thought
you'd gone insane,

229
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:07,839
and I questioned
your leadership,

230
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:10,975
second-guessed
every step of the campaign.

231
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:13,044
But you were
my commander.

232
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:16,815
I held my tongue.
I followed orders.

233
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:20,218
Raphael fled.

234
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,104
Most of his loyalists,
dead or captured.

235
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:25,623
Your gambit paid off.
You...Won.

236
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,158
<i>We</i> won.

237
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,410
Word of your victory
spread.

238
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:31,462
You got called back
to the garrison.

239
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:36,284
You became
the great Castiel...

240
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:40,038
While I stayed behind,
just a grunt.

241
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,775
You gained a reputation
for yourself, as well.

242
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:46,594
The captives I left
in your care,

243
00:13:46,596 --> 00:13:51,132
you tortured
and killed them.

244
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:55,803
I was ordered to kill
those captives.

245
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:59,057
You've been flying solo
for so long,

246
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:01,476
you've forgotten
that's what angels do.

247
00:14:01,478 --> 00:14:03,545
We follow orders.

248
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:06,731
Not you, though.

249
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:10,201
Not anymore.

250
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:15,540
That's right.

251
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,825
I give them.

252
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:23,414
<i>At home and...</i>

253
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,500
<i>Something hit me...</i>
There. There. There. Stop. Stop. Stop.

254
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:26,568
Candy?

255
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,170
<i>...in the box.</i>
<i>They put me in the box.</i>

256
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:31,806
<i>All of us in boxes,</i>
<i>side by side.</i>

257
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:33,675
<i>Me, Jerome, Linda.</i>

258
00:14:33,677 --> 00:14:34,676
Linda's --

259
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:35,677
Ms. Tran.

260
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,896
Candy, these boxes,
where were they?

261
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:39,514
<i>I don't know.</i>

262
00:14:39,516 --> 00:14:43,318
<i>They were cold.</i>

263
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,136
<i>Dark.</i>

264
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:46,905
<i>There -- there was a vent.</i>

265
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:49,324
<i>We could talk to one another.</i>

266
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:52,410
Okay, and the walls,
can you describe them?

267
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:54,979
<i>Bare.</i>

268
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,115
<i>Cement.</i>

269
00:14:57,117 --> 00:15:00,535
<i>Except for the door.</i>
<i>That was...metal,</i>

270
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:03,004
<i>but...like, ridged.</i>

271
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:04,822
Ridged?
You mean like corrugated?

272
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:05,990
<i>Yeah!</i>

273
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:09,410
<i>I tried to lift the door,</i>
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

274
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:11,679
<i>Locked from the outside.</i>

275
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:12,714
Like a storage unit?

276
00:15:12,716 --> 00:15:14,182
Maybe.

277
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:16,968
Candy,
who was holding you there?

278
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,569
<i>Two men.</i>

279
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:22,140
<i>It was so dark in the box.</i>

280
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:25,443
<i>When they came,</i>
<i>I could barely see.</i>

281
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:28,012
<i>The -- the first guy</i>
<i>was British, I think.</i>

282
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:31,933
<i>Kind of short,</i>
<i>loved hearing himself talk.</i>

283
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:34,819
Crowley.
And what do they want?

284
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:37,521
<i>Said I was worth more alive</i>
<i>than dead.</i>

285
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:40,658
<i>But he stopped coming.</i>

286
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,361
Then it was just the other guy.

287
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:47,632
<i>We thought with just him...</i>

288
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:52,870
<i>...we'd try to escape.</i>

289
00:15:56,392 --> 00:16:02,146
<i>I ran so hard, so far, but...</i>

290
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:05,716
Candy?

291
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,171
Candy, are you there?

292
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:29,624
What about Ms. Tran?

293
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:31,175
Candy?

294
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,228
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe she survived.</i>

295
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,380
Maybe?

296
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:37,281
That's not what you told
her son.

297
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:38,516
<i>I said she</i> was <i>alive.</i>

298
00:16:38,518 --> 00:16:41,703
<i>I don't know what happened</i>
<i>after.</i>

299
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:42,970
<i>For her sake,</i>

300
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:45,490
<i>I hope she's dead.</i>

301
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:06,494
No! No!

302
00:17:06,496 --> 00:17:09,263
No! No!

303
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:11,165
No!

304
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:22,270
Okay, there are three
storage facilities nearby.

305
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:25,390
The closest one
is about a mile up the road.

306
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:28,626
Oh, and I, uh --
I dug up some stuff on Candy.

307
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:32,564
Turns out she was the kept woman
of a powerful Congressman.

308
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:35,350
Gossip blog said he worshiped
the ground she walked on,

309
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:36,484
literally.

310
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:37,669
He, uh -- foot fetish.

311
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:39,354
So, Crowley was holding

312
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:42,473
the beloved tootsies
of a powerful politician?

313
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:45,493
And the beloved mother
of a powerful Prophet.

314
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:47,445
Human leverage.

315
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:49,748
But why kill Candy?

316
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,650
Well, you heard her.

317
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:54,619
Uh, she tried to make
a break for it.

318
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:56,688
Maybe Crowley wanted to make
an example.

319
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,622
No.

320
00:17:57,624 --> 00:17:59,674
No.
The guy left in charge.

321
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:02,093
Crowley wanted the victims
alive.

322
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:05,797
So, what,
you want to give him a medal?

323
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,632
I mean, Crowley's the one

324
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,834
who put them in the cells
in the first place.

325
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:11,102
Yeah, I know.

326
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:13,722
I'm just talking it out.
You know, working the case.

327
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:17,242
Businesslike.

328
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:21,229
Realizing they were more trouble
than they were worth,

329
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:23,548
we purged
our human allies,

330
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,350
then commandeered
Boyle Ministries, Inc.

331
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:28,653
For our own use.

332
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:32,157
Buddy Boyle.
So, you killed him.

333
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,460
No. We made him
and his colleagues vessels.

334
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:38,529
At least those
who didn't go "pop."

335
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:46,204
You nervous, Castiel?

336
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:48,757
Your followers
want me dead.

337
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,226
I'm not entirely certain
you don't, too.

338
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:54,479
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

339
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:58,183
So, we're friends here?

340
00:18:58,185 --> 00:18:59,234
Yes.

341
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:00,268
And I'm free to go?

342
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,087
Of course.

343
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:04,022
Though,
I don't know why you would.

344
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:06,991
What's out there for you,
Castiel?

345
00:19:06,993 --> 00:19:10,745
What do you really expect
to accomplish on your own?

346
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:13,564
You'll never find Metatron
that way.

347
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:16,117
How'd you know
about Metatron?

348
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,736
I figured that's why
you were pursuing Rebecca,

349
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:20,455
engaging
with her follower.

350
00:19:20,457 --> 00:19:23,741
We have different methods, Cass,
but we want the same thing --

351
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:27,411
to find Metatron
and restore our kind to heaven.

352
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:30,381
Then why kill Rebecca
and her followers?

353
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:32,183
They're no threat to you.

354
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:35,437
Perhaps, but better to nip
a fledgling faction in the bud

355
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,972
than let it grow into
a bigger threat down the road.

356
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:40,558
A drop of blood
to save a gallon.

357
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,759
I don't agree.

358
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:43,228
I'm not asking you to.

359
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,431
I will outrace Malachi
in the hunt for Metatron,

360
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:49,567
and I will certainly outrace you
on your own.

361
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:51,286
But if you can set aside

362
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:54,439
your qualms about methods
for one second,

363
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:58,460
there's no reason the two of us
can't take him down.

364
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:00,421
Together.

365
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:07,051
Let me guess --
5'5", pasty white,

366
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:10,421
black-rimmed hipster glasses
just like the last place.

367
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,758
Nailed it.

368
00:20:14,895 --> 00:20:16,010
Can I help you?

369
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:18,563
Yeah, hi.
Agents Nicks and McVie.

370
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:20,915
Need to take a look
at your, uh, rental records.

371
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:24,953
Uh, my manager's not here.
I really don't think I should --

372
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,020
Hey!

373
00:20:26,022 --> 00:20:27,689
The records, pal.

374
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:29,157
Yeah.

375
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:30,825
Barry!

376
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:33,528
Bring out
the rental binder!

377
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,207
There you go, sir.

378
00:21:00,022 --> 00:21:01,856
Hey.

379
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:09,230
Okay, check it out.
Corridor "Q."

380
00:21:09,232 --> 00:21:12,567
Three adjacent units
separate from the others.

381
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:15,186
I mean, Candy said there were
three hostages, right?

382
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:17,572
Yeah.

383
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:21,125
Okay.

384
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:24,028
It's all leased
by the same guy -- a D. Webster.

385
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,580
D. Webster?

386
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:28,016
Wait. As in, like,
Daniel Webster?

387
00:21:28,018 --> 00:21:31,970
Well, I know a lame
Crowley in-joke when I see one.

388
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:34,372
You guys say
"D. Webster"?

389
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:36,140
Yeah.

390
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:37,976
Yeah, you --
you seen him?

391
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:41,563
Uh, no, just...

392
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:43,348
I know his name
from the records.

393
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,515
He's leasing another unit

394
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:46,484
on the other side
of the facility.

395
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:49,654
I could show you.

396
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:51,856
Yeah.
That'd be great.

397
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:54,275
All right, why don't you take
corridor "Q"?

398
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:57,912
I'll go with, uh,
Del the funky homosapien.

399
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,923
Hmm.

400
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:49,163
Ms. Tran!

401
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:50,465
Ms. Tran!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

402
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:52,166
Hey, it's me.
It's Sam. It's Sam.

403
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:53,167
Sam?

404
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:54,302
Oh, my gosh.

405
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:55,887
Sam?

406
00:22:55,889 --> 00:23:00,224
We have to get out of here
before it comes back.

407
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:02,176
Is Kevin with you?

408
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,531
Oh!

409
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,513
You sure this is the one
leased by Webster?

410
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:41,599
Yeah, this is it.

411
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:57,565
This isn't Crowley's unit.

412
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:12,663
What are these
locations?

413
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:15,366
Sightings of Metatron.

414
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:18,536
He's been on earth?

415
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:21,089
Three times
we know of so far.

416
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:24,592
That's the benefit
of a massive ground operation.

417
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:25,927
Eyes and ears everywhere.

418
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:27,711
It's only a matter of time

419
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:29,764
before we get
an active location.

420
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:31,882
Why wait?

421
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:35,937
With this kind of information,
I'd lure him out.

422
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:38,072
I knew you'd be an asset.

423
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:40,575
No one's as motivated as you
to take him down.

424
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:43,444
I've had my hands so full
with the factions,

425
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:46,080
it's distracted me
from the real goal.

426
00:24:46,082 --> 00:24:49,000
But with you
by my side --

427
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:52,670
the new boss and the ultimate
rebel working together --

428
00:24:52,672 --> 00:24:55,957
think of the message that would
send to would-be dissidents.

429
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:58,826
They'd finally understand
that resistance is futile.

430
00:24:58,828 --> 00:25:03,131
Think of the bloodshed
we could avert...

431
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:06,584
What a united angelkind
could accomplish in heaven...

432
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:09,086
Elsewhere.

433
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:19,981
Bart, what are you doing?

434
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:21,232
What needs to be done.

435
00:25:21,234 --> 00:25:24,268
I'm gonna torture the rebel,
find out what he knows,

436
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,571
then kill him.

437
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:28,990
And you're going to help.

438
00:25:40,703 --> 00:25:42,771
Here we go.
All right.

439
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:43,956
Oh.

440
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:47,459
There's a --
there's an electrical line,

441
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:49,244
leads to
the control panel.

442
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:02,958
Okay,
this might take a while.

443
00:26:05,795 --> 00:26:08,597
We have to unplug
the ground wire first.

444
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,350
If this is standard
U.S. color coding,

445
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:13,468
it should be
the green one.

446
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,170
okay.

447
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:17,439
Helping Kevin with his
engineering-club assignments,

448
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:18,941
I picked up
a thing or two.

449
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:22,694
I'm sure he insisted,

450
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:24,496
but I trust
you weren't foolish enough

451
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:26,314
to bring Kevin along
on this mission.

452
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:30,619
That you left him
someplace safe?

453
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:32,037
Of course.

454
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,705
Good.

455
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:37,643
Now all we have to do
is get this door open,

456
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:42,764
get the hell out of here,
and you will bring me to my son.

457
00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:48,937
Listen.

458
00:26:50,673 --> 00:26:53,174
Ms. Tran.

459
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:08,206
You will take me
to my son.

460
00:27:12,295 --> 00:27:14,246
Flashlight.

461
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:17,282
Flashlight!

462
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:29,745
"Trust me," he says.

463
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:32,064
"You definitely
want to be a part of this --

464
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:35,067
"a chance to get in on the
ground floor of my operation,

465
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:38,654
"a real learning experience.

466
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:44,743
Consider it a stepping stone,
my lad -- like an internship."

467
00:27:44,745 --> 00:27:46,361
Should've known.

468
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:49,081
Internships suck.

469
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:53,752
So, you're the one.

470
00:27:55,121 --> 00:27:57,139
You're the one
who Crowley left in charge.

471
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:59,291
Yeah.
What a privilege.

472
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:03,812
Feeding the apes,
hosing the floors,

473
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:08,050
washing out the honey buckets,
and for zero credit.

474
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:11,119
The boss, M.I.A.

475
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:14,139
Too important
to show for work,

476
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:16,274
to even return my calls.

477
00:28:16,276 --> 00:28:21,396
And you know
the worst part?

478
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:26,368
I wasn't even allowed
to kill anyone.

479
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,704
I was told
to protect them.

480
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,824
I mean,
how sick is that?

481
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:36,294
Am I not
a young, vital demon

482
00:28:36,296 --> 00:28:39,381
with basic demon needs
and rights?

483
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:46,054
And when I call Crowley
to inform him

484
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:49,958
that I've single-handedly
caught the Winchesters,

485
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,762
if he even answers
my call,

486
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:56,515
think I'll get
a thank you?

487
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,734
Ha!

488
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:01,687
Yeah, you're right, kid.

489
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:04,790
He won't give you credit.

490
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:06,575
If anything,
he'll be pissed.

491
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:09,494
What?

492
00:29:09,496 --> 00:29:13,115
Well, me and Crowley,
we're -- we're tight now.

493
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:14,916
Thick as thieves.

494
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:16,418
Saw him just last month.

495
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,087
We, uh,
had a grand ol' time.

496
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:27,045
So, that's where he's been.

497
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:30,515
Out partying with humans,
with hunters?!

498
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:34,169
While I languish here

499
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:39,608
in this go-nowhere,
no-kill joke of a job.

500
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,562
"Partying"
is a bit of an exaggeration.

501
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:46,031
This job blows!

502
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:55,490
I quit.

503
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:58,543
Tell me where they are.

504
00:29:58,545 --> 00:30:02,414
I told you.
They're dead.

505
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,632
I'm the last.

506
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:06,468
Can't you see he's telling
the truth? He's done.

507
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,255
Yes, I believe he is.

508
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:16,128
Now finish him off.

509
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,814
Bartholomew,
it doesn't need to be like this.

510
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:20,766
Castiel,
get your head out of the sand.

511
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:25,320
Do you know why they brought you
back from the battlefield?

512
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:26,321
The truth?

513
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:27,806
Yes, I know the truth.

514
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:30,075
Our leaders
wanted those captives killed,

515
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:32,861
and they knew you'd
stand in the way of their order.

516
00:30:32,863 --> 00:30:35,413
Said you didn't
have it in you.

517
00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:38,083
That you couldn't do
what needed to be done.

518
00:30:38,085 --> 00:30:42,037
But I know different.

519
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,705
I know you've changed.

520
00:30:43,707 --> 00:30:45,073
I'm not a murderer.

521
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:46,591
You weren't. Not then.

522
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:50,712
But since then, you've
slaughtered thousands of angels.

523
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:53,298
You killed Malachi's man
for his Grace.

524
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,219
Who I was, what I did,
that's not who I am.

525
00:30:57,221 --> 00:31:01,690
No?
Then who are you?

526
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:04,810
I want to work with you,
Castiel, but I need proof.

527
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:08,096
They need proof
that they were wrong.

528
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:12,450
That you can do
what has to be done.

529
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:16,872
This has to be done.

530
00:31:19,775 --> 00:31:21,743
I was never free to leave.

531
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:25,113
My only choice
was to obey or be killed.

532
00:31:27,884 --> 00:31:30,168
Well, I choose.

533
00:31:33,005 --> 00:31:35,257
I am truly
sorry to hear that.

534
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:37,225
No!

535
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:38,960
Aah!

536
00:31:46,302 --> 00:31:50,322
Do you know how long it's been
since I've done this?

537
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:58,613
I thank you for reminding me
what I truly am.

538
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,129
As your refusal
makes perfectly clear,

539
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:17,132
you always thought
you were better than me.

540
00:32:21,854 --> 00:32:27,175
Shall we put your superiority
to the test once and for all?

541
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:32,513
No.

542
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:38,370
Angels fighting angels
has to stop somewhere.

543
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:40,822
Might as well stop
with me.

544
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:44,242
Fine.

545
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:50,031
Stand down!

546
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:52,083
This is between me
and the rebel.

547
00:32:58,424 --> 00:33:01,927
To the victor.

548
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:06,564
Do it.

549
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:10,819
No.

550
00:33:14,774 --> 00:33:17,609
What are you now?
A penitent?

551
00:33:17,611 --> 00:33:20,228
I'm nothing.

552
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,698
You never did understand,
Castiel.

553
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,002
There can be no peace
without bloodshed.

554
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,344
Aah!

555
00:33:47,723 --> 00:33:50,108
Let me pass.

556
00:33:58,684 --> 00:34:02,020
Do it. Kill me.

557
00:34:02,022 --> 00:34:03,855
No, we're saving you
for someone else.

558
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:06,624
Crowley.

559
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:11,997
Much worse.

560
00:34:23,009 --> 00:34:24,726
Do the honors,
Ms. Tran.

561
00:34:26,762 --> 00:34:28,680
With pleasure.

562
00:34:28,682 --> 00:34:32,400
Hey, lady. I swear.

563
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:33,568
I was just following ord--

564
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:45,864
Take me to my son.

565
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:02,060
Kevin?

566
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:04,730
You here?

567
00:35:06,132 --> 00:35:09,268
Kev?

568
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,187
Well?

569
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:16,441
We got her.

570
00:35:16,443 --> 00:35:19,661
She's alive.

571
00:35:19,663 --> 00:35:21,997
She's here.

572
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:23,832
But we wanted
to give you a moment to...

573
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:26,585
You know, process.

574
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:29,755
Oh.

575
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:33,058
I, uh...

576
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,376
Does she know?

577
00:35:35,678 --> 00:35:38,213
Kevin?

578
00:35:47,607 --> 00:35:50,175
Hello, son.

579
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:53,695
Hey, Mom.

580
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:58,317
Oh.

581
00:36:00,153 --> 00:36:03,455
So, this is, uh --
this is all of it.

582
00:36:03,457 --> 00:36:05,741
You know,
hunter's tools --

583
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:10,796
notebooks, papers, pencils,
P.S.A.T. results.

584
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:13,382
Perfect score.

585
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:16,134
Way to go, kid.

586
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:17,719
This.

587
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:19,755
This is it.

588
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:22,791
His father's.

589
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:26,478
Mr. Tran died
when Kevin was a baby.

590
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,547
It's the only piece
of his father Kevin ever had.

591
00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:37,889
If Kevin's s-spirit is bound
to some object here...

592
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:39,992
This is it.

593
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:45,364
Listen, Ms. Tran.

594
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:49,401
There's a lot that we don't know
about this heaven situation.

595
00:36:49,403 --> 00:36:52,671
There are risks
to taking Kevin home with you.

596
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:56,124
Now, spirits, the longer
that they're in the veil,

597
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:57,993
they have a way of...

598
00:36:57,995 --> 00:37:02,097
Well,
it doesn't end up well.

599
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,517
He's my son.

600
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:11,973
It's my job to keep him safe
for as long as I can.

601
00:37:18,114 --> 00:37:21,900
Sorry I created this chaos.

602
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,655
Sorry I couldn't do more
to fix it.

603
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:33,245
You may have lost the war,
Rebecca,

604
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:35,280
but you tried a new way.

605
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:37,833
You have my respect for that.

606
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:43,689
I don't want to fight.

607
00:37:43,691 --> 00:37:46,341
But if I have to,
I will.

608
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:48,093
I didn't come to fight.

609
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,447
When I fell,
I thought I had no choice,

610
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:55,984
but yesterday, you've showed me
that there is a choice.

611
00:37:55,986 --> 00:37:57,686
And I choose you.

612
00:37:59,222 --> 00:38:00,906
I'm sorry.

613
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:02,974
I'm no leader.

614
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:05,494
Yes, you are.

615
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:08,697
If you will have me, Castiel,
I will follow you.

616
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:13,051
And I am not
the only one.

617
00:38:18,157 --> 00:38:22,010
She was held and tortured
for a year because of me.

618
00:38:22,012 --> 00:38:23,995
Now that I found her,

619
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:27,632
I'm not letting her
out of my sight.

620
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:29,267
She's my responsibility.

621
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:32,170
And you were ours.

622
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:34,556
And we failed you.
I --

623
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:35,690
Sam.

624
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:37,109
I know that wasn't you.

625
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:40,278
Go put a blade
in that asshat who possessed you

626
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,813
and we'll call it square.

627
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:47,185
Guys.

628
00:38:47,187 --> 00:38:49,371
Thank you.

629
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,126
You can thank us when we get you
to heaven where you belong.

630
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:56,878
Okay, until then,
enjoy your time with your mom.

631
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,501
The, uh, uninterrupted,
24/7, no-escape quality time.

632
00:39:03,836 --> 00:39:06,254
Dick.

633
00:39:08,558 --> 00:39:11,726
Hey, before I go...

634
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:13,395
Will you guys
promise me something?

635
00:39:13,397 --> 00:39:16,348
Yeah. Anything.

636
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,518
Can you two...

637
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,936
Get over it?

638
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:25,106
Dudes, just 'cause
you couldn't see me

639
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:27,142
doesn't mean
I couldn't see you.

640
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:30,362
The drama, the fighting...

641
00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:32,564
It's stupid.

642
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:38,703
My mom's
taking home a ghost.

643
00:39:38,705 --> 00:39:41,122
You two...

644
00:39:41,124 --> 00:39:42,791
You're both still here.

645
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:45,644
Of course.

646
00:39:45,646 --> 00:39:47,295
Promise.

647
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:50,265
Yeah.

648
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:51,583
Good.

649
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,276
Well, that was...

650
00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:25,166
Yeah, okay.
