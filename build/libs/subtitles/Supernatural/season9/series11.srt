1
00:00:03,274 --> 00:00:04,417
My name is Abaddon.

2
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:06,052
Who is a knight of hell.

3
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:07,086
I am your king.

4
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:08,354
About that...

5
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:12,642
You lied to me...Again.

6
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:14,894
I didn't have a choice.

7
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:18,148
So, what?

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,784
Being possessed
by some psycho angel?

9
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:25,038
I know who you really are.
Gadreel.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,040
I will join you
as second in command.

11
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:29,075
Here's the first name
on your to-do list.

12
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:30,243
No!

13
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,913
I save Sam,
I leave here a free man.

14
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:37,050
Take control, Sam!
Cast him out!

15
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:38,334
He saved your life.

16
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:41,788
The thought of somebody else
being hurt 'cause of me...

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,089
I can't live with that.

18
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:44,674
Kevin's blood
is on my hands.

19
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:47,510
I'll find Gadreel, and I will
end that son of a bitch.

20
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:49,062
But I'll do it alone.

21
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:52,232
Go.
I'm not gonna stop you.

22
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,037
He's coming!

23
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:18,374
Stand your ground,
no matter what happens.

24
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:19,826
The knight must be protected.

25
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:37,477
Aah!

26
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:08,138
<font color=#00FF00>? Supernatural 9x11 ?</font>

28
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:26,058
So...is that boudoir smile
for me?

29
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:29,162
At least buy me
a drink first.

30
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:31,581
I said the next time
I see you --

31
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,832
Dead.
Yes, rings a bell,

32
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,951
but let's not dwell
on the past, shall we?

33
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,070
This bar is a bust.

34
00:02:38,072 --> 00:02:40,757
That waitress is trouble
with a capital VD,

35
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,593
and your prey, Gadreel,
has left the building.

36
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:47,213
So, it's time to move on
to more pressing matters,

37
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:49,632
like destroying Abaddon.

38
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:50,917
Yeah, good luck
with that.

39
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,353
The Knights of Hell
aren't exactly the dying kind.

40
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:56,723
But there is <i>something</i>
that can kill a knight.

41
00:02:56,725 --> 00:03:00,360
The weapon that the archangels
used to execute them --

42
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:01,811
the First Blade.

43
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:02,929
Never heard of it.

44
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:04,948
Can I kill you now?

45
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,434
I've been chasing that blade
for decades.

46
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:11,771
The closest I got to it was when
one of my droogs -- Smitty --

47
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:15,441
got wind of a prot?g? demon
of Abaddon's

48
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:17,994
who claimed knowledge
of the blade.

49
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:21,247
Sadly, before Smitty
could nab the guy,

50
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:24,300
a hunter by the name
of John Winchester

51
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:25,785
nabbed the protege.

52
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,553
I'm here to see
if there's anything

53
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:30,223
in the John Winchester
memorial library

54
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:35,228
that might lead us to the first
blade -- to killing Abaddon.

55
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,264
You want to hunt?
With me?

56
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:42,268
I do love
a good buddy comedy.

57
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:02,255
Oh, yeah. Here it is.

58
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:05,959
Yeah, he picked up a prot?g?
who had bones with Abaddon,

59
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:07,593
but that's about all it says
in here.

60
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,547
What do those numbers
in the margins mean?

61
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:12,432
None of your business.

62
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:14,550
You're gonna play
hard to get?

63
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:16,536
We have time for a montage?

64
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,475
It's a code --
one of my dad's storage lockers.

65
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:24,310
He may have put something
about the case there.

66
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:27,313
And what does the "T"
next to the numbers mean?

67
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:28,231
Not a clue.

68
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,782
Fine.

69
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:32,402
Let's go find daddy's man cave,
then, shall we?

70
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:36,372
And how do I know
this isn’t a trap?

71
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:38,875
You...don't.

72
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:41,210
That's what makes it fun.

73
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:09,605
Mm.

74
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:14,226
Hey.

75
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:17,563
Tastes like...molecules.

76
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:18,498
What?

77
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,900
What are you talking about?

78
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:24,420
When I was human, you know,
I had to eat constantly.

79
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:26,506
It was kind of annoying.

80
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:28,591
Yeah, a lot of human things
are pretty annoying.

81
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:31,944
But...I enjoyed
the taste of food --

82
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:36,099
particularly peanut butter
with grape jelly, not jam.

83
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,184
Jam I found unsettling.

84
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:39,251
So, what?

85
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:41,554
Now you can't taste
PB and J?

86
00:05:41,556 --> 00:05:44,557
No, I-I taste
every molecule.

87
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,810
Not the sum
of its parts, huh?

88
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:50,429
It's overwhelming.

89
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:52,598
It's disgusting.

90
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,453
I miss you, PB and J.

91
00:05:57,455 --> 00:06:00,456
We need to continue
your healing.

92
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,792
We're almost done.

93
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,166
What?

94
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:11,050
Nothing.

95
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:12,468
You're a terrible liar.

96
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,820
That is not true.

97
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:16,639
I once deceived <i>and</i> betrayed
both you and your brother.

98
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:17,640
Okay,
that's not the point.

99
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:20,977
Cass, what's wrong?

100
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,478
I noticed something.

101
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,314
It's, uh...
It's resonating inside you.

102
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:26,115
What?

103
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:27,650
Something angelic.

104
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:30,236
Okay, uh, what the hell
does that mean?

105
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:31,971
Maybe we
should call Dean.

106
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:36,275
No.

107
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:39,195
He wanted to go,
and he's gone.

108
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:41,180
We'll handle this.

109
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:55,061
Is all this
really necessary?

110
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:56,996
I mean, I've been
inside your brother.

111
00:06:56,998 --> 00:06:58,364
We're practically family.

112
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,051
Listen to me.

113
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:05,304
We are the furthest thing
from family.

114
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:07,757
You got that, dickbag?

115
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,725
Oh, yeah.

116
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:12,979
Now, you want to hunt?
Let's hunt.

117
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:22,238
I'll be right here.

118
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:27,160
So, what do you call
this decor, anyway?

119
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:31,080
Rustic obsessive?
Paranoid deco?

120
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:35,734
Here we go.

121
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:39,789
Looks like my dad
was working with another hunter

122
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,674
when he nabbed Abaddon's pet.

123
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:46,929
I guess the "T" didn't stand
for terrible father.

124
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:47,964
It stood for --

125
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:49,498
Tara.

126
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,666
Doesn't ring a bell.

127
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:55,137
All right, looks like
they interrogated the demon.

128
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,356
Then they exorcised him.

129
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:00,526
But not before he mentioned
the First Blade.

130
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:02,278
I love it when I'm right.

131
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,946
Yeah, well, the rest
of the file's empty, genius.

132
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:05,198
What?

133
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,950
Didn't they teach note-taking
at hunters Hogwarts?

134
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:10,786
Let's go see
if Tara's still kicking.

135
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:15,374
I've found,
well, something.

136
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:18,544
It's a detail about when angels
leave their vessels...

137
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:19,712
I think.

138
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:23,666
It's, uh, Enochian,
which can be a bit flowery.

139
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:25,585
"And the departed
shall remain,

140
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:28,604
and the remains
shall be the departed".

141
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:31,757
Okay, so,
when an angel leaves a vessel,

142
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,309
they leave behind
a piece of themselves.

143
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:36,345
Like, uh...
Like an angelic fingerprint.

144
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:37,563
Whatever you want to call it,

145
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:40,933
this piece of the departed
contains Grace.

146
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:43,069
Wait, you're saying there's
angelic Grace inside of me?

147
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:45,104
Yes.

148
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:47,323
But it's fading
each time I heal you.

149
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:49,442
Okay.
Is that good or bad?

150
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:52,328
Well
it's harmless.

151
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,416
But the Grace itself...
might be helpful.

152
00:08:58,285 --> 00:08:59,652
According to this,

153
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:02,321
we may be able to use the Grace
that remains inside you

154
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:06,842
to track Gadreel...
If we can extract it.

155
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,010
How would we do that?

156
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:10,713
Well...painfully.

157
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:14,850
The Men of Letters
believed that you could perform

158
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:17,353
a tracking spell
with extracted Grace,

159
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:20,356
but they were never able
to test the theory.

160
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:23,392
Well, they didn't have
a guinea pig, but we do.

161
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:26,879
You have a guinea pig?

162
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:27,880
Where?

163
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:33,569
Me, Cass.
I'm the guinea pig.

164
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:36,872
Oh.

165
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,211
Any idea where that is?

166
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,549
Tara?

167
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:49,802
That's what the sign says.

168
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:52,588
Can I help you?

169
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,756
Yeah. Hope so.

170
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:55,374
John Winchester
ring a bell?

171
00:09:56,226 --> 00:09:57,426
I'm his son.

172
00:09:57,428 --> 00:10:00,563
You Sam or Dean?
Dean.

173
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,719
Well, didn't you
grow up pretty.

174
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:09,855
Still in
the family business?

175
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:11,223
Yeah, born and raised.

176
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:13,826
Listen, bunch of years back,
you worked a job with my dad.

177
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:17,062
Well, me and my,
uh, associate h--

178
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:19,532
Ever since '92,
I get a painful little tickle

179
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:22,251
in what's left of my knee
whenever a demon is around.

180
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:25,087
Hunters. So trusting.

181
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:26,872
I'll go grab a latte
while you get this sorted.

182
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,677
Devil's trap under
the knock-off Persian, jackass.

183
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:40,970
Tara  listen,
my, uh, associate --

184
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,605
Friends --
besties, actually.

185
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:44,273
Not helping.
Not caring.

186
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:48,811
Look, I'm the King of Hell.
He's a Winchester.

187
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:51,564
There's a reason why
we're working together.

188
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:54,099
Yeah.
It's called possession.

189
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:01,574
See? I'm good.

190
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:03,542
Okay?

191
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:05,628
Yes, you're right.

192
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,663
He is a jackass,
but he's helping me on this.

193
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:08,831
Helping you with what?

194
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,150
You and my old man
found a demon

195
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:13,002
who knew something
about the First Blade.

196
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:14,754
We need to find
that blade.

197
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:16,639
Well, hell.

198
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,809
You are as handsome
as John.

199
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:24,563
And as dumb, too, if you're
looking for that old relic.

200
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:27,683
We're hunting
a Knight of Hell.

201
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:28,934
Why? They're all dead.

202
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:31,654
One came back --
Abaddon.

203
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:36,809
The demon said
the archangels used a weapon

204
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:38,360
that could kill
the Knights of Hell.

205
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:41,330
We'd never heard of anything
like the Knights of Hell

206
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:42,898
or a First Blade.

207
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,285
Your dad thought he was lying,
trying to save himself.

208
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:48,120
We took him out,

209
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:50,873
and we had
a lovely weekend together.

210
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:56,962
Then we went
our separate ways.

211
00:11:56,964 --> 00:11:58,931
But I could never
let the blade go.

212
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:01,493
Something like that could really
give a hunter an edge, you know?

213
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:07,022
I looked all over the world --
destroyed my knee and my life.

214
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:08,774
And all I found?

215
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:13,195
A location spell
for the blade

216
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:16,398
That I could never finish.

217
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,834
Couldn't find
one ingredient --

218
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,119
essence of Kraken.

219
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:21,370
Kraken?

220
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,957
I got a warehouse full
of Kraken essence in Belize.

221
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:27,326
Break the trap,

222
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:28,911
I can be there and back
before you say, "presto".

223
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:32,248
Presto.
I can help. Dean?

224
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,184
He wants Abaddon
as dead as I do.

225
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:41,140
If your daddy
could see you now.

226
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:56,689
You know,
even if that blade is real,

227
00:12:56,691 --> 00:12:59,074
it ain't worth being bosom
buddies with the King of Hell.

228
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:03,612
Abaddon? Way worse.

229
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:05,514
I'll deal with Crowley after.

230
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:07,049
Trust me.

231
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:10,302
You sound
just like your dad...

232
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:11,971
when he said he'd call me.

233
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:19,261
Shall we?

234
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:51,777
Missouri. Figures.

235
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:54,163
Would you care to join us?

236
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:55,915
Him? Anytime.

237
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,466
You? Never.

238
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:01,253
Thank you.

239
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:02,454
Good luck, Dean.

240
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,890
You're gonna need it.

241
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:29,314
Wait.

242
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:30,165
What?

243
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,367
I'm feeling something.

244
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:33,619
Oh, cramps?

245
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:35,838
I feel something dark.

246
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,007
What, darker than <i>you?</i>

247
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:41,710
Oh, no.

248
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:45,998
We need to leave here now.

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,933
What, are you allergic
to bees?

250
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:50,219
That's not a beekeeper.

251
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:52,021
That's the father of murder.

252
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:55,524
Sorry. Who?

253
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:57,109
It's Cain.

254
00:14:58,361 --> 00:14:59,445
As in Cain and Abel?

255
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:00,529
Dean.

256
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:04,033
We need to be a world away
from here -- from him.

257
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:06,184
You're not going anywhere.

258
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:08,821
Crowley.

259
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,573
First BladeWhy don't you
just zap out of here?

260
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:29,510
I'd never leave
my domestic partner in crime.

261
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,215
Yeah, like your heart
grew three sizes.

262
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:36,251
You can't zap out of here,
can you?

263
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:39,855
Cain's doing something to me.

264
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,426
Well, it's not your day
for getaways, is it?

265
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:47,262
All right,
so, tell me about this Cain.

266
00:15:47,264 --> 00:15:49,764
Well, after Cain killed Abel,
he became a demon.

267
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:52,784
What do you mean
"became a demon"?

268
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,686
I mean he became
the deadliest demon

269
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,288
to walk the face
of the earth.

270
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,106
Killed thousands.

271
00:15:58,108 --> 00:16:00,458
The best
at being the worst.

272
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,994
And then he just...

273
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,379
Disappeared.

274
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:09,467
Everyone thought he was dead
or, at least, <i>hoped</i> he was.

275
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,720
Do either of you keep bees?

276
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,091
It's very relaxing.

277
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:19,477
They're such
noble creatures.

278
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,478
And the honey?

279
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,398
Well, I keep it right
on the comb.

280
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,432
There you are.

281
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,188
They're dying, you know.

282
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,609
Without bees,
mankind will cease to exist.

283
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:38,947
So, what are
the King of Hell

284
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:42,867
and a Winchester
doing at my house?

285
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,485
You know who we are?

286
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:46,871
I'm retired.
I'm not dead.

287
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:50,692
What I don't know
is why you're looking for me --

288
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:53,929
more importantly,
how you found me.

289
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,832
Ah, that's, uh,
a funny story, really.

290
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,035
Bit of a misunderstanding.
We really should --

291
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,437
Shh.

292
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,392
Oh, you gotta teach me
how to do that.

293
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,944
Why are you here, Dean?

294
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,401
We're looking for the weapon
the archangels used

295
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,986
to kill
the Knights of Hell.

296
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:21,039
The First Blade.

297
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,293
We need it to kill
a Knight of Hell -- Abaddon.

298
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,636
Look, I get it.
You're retired.

299
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:39,674
We're not here to get between
you and the demonic AARP,

300
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:41,042
but it's bad out there,

301
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:42,727
and I'm just looking
to even the odds.

302
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,680
One last time --
how did you find me?

303
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:47,616
We didn't.

304
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:50,218
The location spell
was for the blade.

305
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,736
One-time deal.

306
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,024
Anyone else
know you're here?

307
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:58,226
No.

308
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,569
Excuse me, ma'am.

309
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:09,587
Wonder if you
might have seen

310
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,923
some of my friends
pass through here.

311
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,093
Big guy,
kind of funny ears.

312
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,218
Well, it's been a pleasure
having company,

313
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,920
but once a century
is enough for me.

314
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:27,772
You can let
yourselves out.

315
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,224
Hey, listen, pal.

316
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:31,393
We're not leaving here
without the Blade.

317
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:33,862
You have quite a reputation,
Dean.

318
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,898
I see the part about you
being brave rings true.

319
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,983
Well, what can I say?
I'm an all-in kind of guy.

320
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,454
Abaddon is the last
Knight of Hell,

321
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:45,790
and if you're out of the game,
what the hell do you care if she dies?

322
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,125
If your friend here
could talk,

323
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,577
he would tell you that I trained
the Knights of Hell.

324
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:53,081
I built that entire demonic
order with my own hands --

325
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,632
Abaddon included.

326
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,420
Well,
that is information

327
00:18:58,422 --> 00:18:59,988
I could have used
five minutes ago!

328
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:04,125
Well, here's something
your friend doesn't know,

329
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:07,812
that no one knows, in fact --
outside of Abaddon.

330
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,166
It wasn't the archangels
that slaughtered the knights.

331
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:12,567
It was me.

332
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,186
Why did you turn on your own?

333
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:18,740
Once again,
I admire your bravery.

334
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,977
But if you'll excuse me,
I have errands to run in town.

335
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:26,030
Goodbye, Dean Winchester.

336
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,667
Never return.

337
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,487
Well, that was lovely.

338
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:33,872
Can we leave
the country now?

339
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,490
But you said the First Blade
was our only shot

340
00:19:35,492 --> 00:19:36,541
at killing Abaddon.

341
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,159
This is the closest
you've been to it.

342
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:39,327
We're not leaving.

343
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,014
Will you listen to reason
for once?

344
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:43,932
Hey.

345
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,467
He said he was going
into town.

346
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:46,584
Awesome.

347
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,336
We wait till he's gone,
come back,

348
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:49,554
bust in,
take what's ours.

349
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:50,722
Got it?

350
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,443
Sam, may I ask you
a question?

351
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,694
You just did.

352
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,863
Can I ask you
another question?

353
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,533
Well, technically, you --
yeah, go ahead. What's up?

354
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:03,868
Sam, the trials.

355
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:08,823
You chose not to go through with
them for a reason, didn't you?

356
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:12,627
You chose to live rather than
to sacrifice yourself.

357
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,130
You and Dean...
You chose each other.

358
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,132
Yeah, I did.
We did.

359
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:20,251
And then...
Dean made a choice for me.

360
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,837
What Dean did --
it doesn't matter what Dean did.

361
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,539
Look, I could have put
a stop to all this, Cass.

362
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,541
I could have closed the gates of hell.
Oh, Sam.

363
00:20:26,543 --> 00:20:28,343
Dean's gone, okay?

364
00:20:28,345 --> 00:20:31,980
This is on me now,
and if I can find Gadreel...

365
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,598
I can fix this.

366
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,903
Now...being a human
means settling your debts.

367
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:44,242
Let's start balancing
the books.

368
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:03,795
This is by far the dumbest idea
you've <i>ever</i> had.

369
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:06,097
Yeah, well, it's early.

370
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:10,585
Oh, there's nothing here.
Shame. Let's go.

371
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:12,353
Hey, sack up
and start looking, okay?

372
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,855
We don't have
that much time.

373
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:47,305
You'll never believe what the
Winchester and Crowley found.

374
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:50,225
Send back-up.

375
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,977
Send...Everybody.

376
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:09,253
First Blade

377
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:11,873
Now comes the part
that will actually hurt.

378
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:14,713
I'm gonna begin
the extraction.

379
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:22,771
Is it working?

380
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:24,573
Yeah.

381
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:26,358
But?

382
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:29,111
I-I need to push
the needle in deeper.

383
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:32,764
We need more Grace
in order to cast the spell.

384
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:34,166
Okay. Do it.

385
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:35,734
Sam, if I get
too close to --

386
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:38,453
Damn it, Cass!
Just do it.

387
00:22:57,775 --> 00:22:59,358
What the hell was that?

388
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,560
Your body is regressing to the
state it was in before Gadreel.

389
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:03,612
Do we have enough Grace
for the summoning spell?

390
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:05,931
Sam.
Do we or not, Cass?

391
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:10,118
No.

392
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,458
Then keep going.

393
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:21,613
Nothing.

394
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:22,798
Not even porn.

395
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,217
Think I figured out
why he went off the reservation

396
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:26,969
so many years ago.

397
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:29,838
Lovely. Little plain.
Who is she?

398
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,640
Cain had a similar ring on.

399
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,510
Father of murder got hitched.

400
00:23:35,512 --> 00:23:38,296
He's back. Come on.

401
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,652
Go.

402
00:23:44,904 --> 00:23:47,022
That belongs to me.

403
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:48,574
Sorry.

404
00:23:48,576 --> 00:23:49,491
Gorgeous, by the way.

405
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:58,283
I don't suppose
they're with you.

406
00:23:58,285 --> 00:24:00,786
No.

407
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:02,371
I guess
we can't wait any longer.

408
00:24:03,489 --> 00:24:06,408
Your friend Tara
was very helpful!

409
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,260
Got downright chatty...

410
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:10,762
After I peeled
all her skin off.

411
00:24:10,764 --> 00:24:13,665
We don't want any trouble,
Cain.

412
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:17,886
Just want the so-called King
and the Winchester.

413
00:24:17,888 --> 00:24:19,688
I got a new master
to impress,

414
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,574
and I'm betting bagging
those two will do just that.

415
00:24:22,576 --> 00:24:25,110
"Master"?

416
00:24:25,112 --> 00:24:26,645
Abaddon.

417
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:28,730
This lot
all need to die.

418
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:31,033
I count --
too many.

419
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:33,368
The whammy you put on the doors
that keeps us in.

420
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,070
Will it keep them out?

421
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,622
For now.

422
00:24:37,457 --> 00:24:40,158
I'm gonna barricade
the entrances.

423
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,660
Get ready for a fight.

424
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:43,578
Well, good luck with that.

425
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,713
What?

426
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:48,533
You exposed my home.
You exposed me.

427
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:49,968
Well, boo-hoo.

428
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,837
Brave, but impulsive.

429
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,946
You truly have lived up
to your reputation.

430
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:55,508
I can't say
you've lived up to yours.

431
00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:57,809
What can I say?
I'm retired.

432
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:00,846
If you survive,
you're welcome to join me

433
00:25:00,848 --> 00:25:03,048
for the last meal
I will eat in this house

434
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:06,151
before I disappear again.

435
00:25:06,153 --> 00:25:08,553
It's the least I can do.

436
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:14,559
Sam? Sam?!

437
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:16,361
Keep going.

438
00:25:16,363 --> 00:25:17,529
Why?

439
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:21,566
We -- we --
we have to find Gadreel.

440
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:22,901
No.

441
00:25:22,903 --> 00:25:26,588
Why must the Winchesters
run toward death?

442
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,073
No, don't. Don't.

443
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:29,591
Don't stop.

444
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:33,295
Sam, when I was human,
I died,

445
00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:35,213
and that showed me
that life is precious,

446
00:25:35,215 --> 00:25:38,016
and it must be protected
at all costs, even a life as...

447
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:40,152
as pig-headed
as a Winchester's.

448
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:44,089
My life's not worth any more
than anyone else's --

449
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:47,425
not yours or Dean's...

450
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:50,696
...or Kevin's.

451
00:25:50,698 --> 00:25:53,532
Please.

452
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:57,152
Please, help me
do one thing right.

453
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:59,270
Keep going.

454
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:10,749
All right,
I got this. You take the front.

455
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:18,590
So, this is your play?

456
00:26:18,592 --> 00:26:19,791
Corn?

457
00:26:19,793 --> 00:26:21,593
What am I not getting here?

458
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:23,294
I mean, it's not like
you're a coward.

459
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:25,847
Since when does the great
Dean Winchester ask for help?

460
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:28,683
Well, that doesn't sound like
the man I've read about

461
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:31,336
on demon bathroom walls.

462
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:33,105
Maybe you've lost a step.

463
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:34,823
Let's find out.

464
00:26:42,415 --> 00:26:44,449
Oh, don't mind me.

465
00:26:44,451 --> 00:26:45,617
Enjoy yourself.

466
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:07,222
Doing great.

467
00:27:41,174 --> 00:27:42,891
Really?

468
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:45,543
Isn't it past your bedtime?

469
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,399
You're good.

470
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,090
But I'm Crowley.

471
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,710
What?
Was that some kind of a test?

472
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,997
I felt connected to you
right from the beginning.

473
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:41,449
Kindred spirits,
if you will.

474
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:44,452
You and I are very much alike.
Right.

475
00:28:44,454 --> 00:28:46,888
Yeah, except I didn't kill
my brother.

476
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,207
You saved yours.

477
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:50,325
Why?

478
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:54,296
Because you never give up
on family -- ever.

479
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:56,447
Where's your brother now,
then?

480
00:28:58,551 --> 00:29:00,585
I don't know what kind of game
you're playing here,

481
00:29:00,587 --> 00:29:02,554
and I don't really care.

482
00:29:02,556 --> 00:29:04,306
Just give me the damn blade.

483
00:29:06,225 --> 00:29:07,592
Sorry, Dean.

484
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:10,628
I have nothing to hand over.

485
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,730
What?

486
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:14,316
I no longer have the blade.

487
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:15,633
It's gone.

488
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:31,917
Hold on.

489
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,451
This may pinch.

490
00:29:36,456 --> 00:29:40,125
Cass, what the hell?

491
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,134
Cass.

492
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:50,185
What the hell was that?!

493
00:29:50,187 --> 00:29:52,220
I've healed your wounds
completely.

494
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:53,504
And the Grace?

495
00:29:53,506 --> 00:29:56,057
Well, whatever Grace
was inside you is gone now.

496
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:59,194
What's left of Gadreel
is in here.

497
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:01,896
We'll just have to try the spell
with what we have.

498
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:03,114
Damn it.

499
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:08,519
Sam, I want Gadreel
to pay as much as you do.

500
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:10,422
But nothing is worth
losing you.

501
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:13,691
You know, being human,

502
00:30:13,693 --> 00:30:17,679
it didn't just change
my view of food.

503
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:19,364
It changed my view of <i>you.</i>

504
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,035
I mean, I can relate now
to how you feel.

505
00:30:24,037 --> 00:30:25,920
What are you
talking about?

506
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:30,342
The only person
who has screwed things up

507
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:32,978
more consistently than you...

508
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,813
is me.

509
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:40,385
And now I know
what that guilt feels like.

510
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:41,519
And I know what it...

511
00:30:41,521 --> 00:30:45,707
I know what it means
to feel sorry, Sam.

512
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:47,275
I am sorry.

513
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:52,280
I know.

514
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,584
You know, old me --

515
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:59,371
I would've have
just kept going.

516
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:02,507
I would've jammed that needle in
deeper until you died

517
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:06,011
because the ends
always justified the means.

518
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:10,181
But what I went though --

519
00:31:11,517 --> 00:31:19,090
Well, that PB and J taught me
that angels can change, so...

520
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,310
...who knows?

521
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:25,313
Maybe winchesters can, too.

522
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:40,093
First Blade"Gone"?

523
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:41,911
What do you mean, "gone"?

524
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,246
How?

525
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:46,516
The spell brought us here
to you, so it has to be here.

526
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:50,770
Your spell brought you to
the source of the Blade's power.

527
00:31:50,772 --> 00:31:52,939
Me.

528
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:56,425
Really? Now?

529
00:31:56,427 --> 00:31:57,977
It's the bloody mark
of Cain.

530
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:02,365
From Lucifer himself.

531
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:04,200
The mark and the blade
work together.

532
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:06,619
Without the mark,
the blade is useless.

533
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:08,571
It's just an old bone.

534
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:10,490
A bone?

535
00:32:10,492 --> 00:32:12,775
The jawbone of an animal.

536
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:15,562
The jawbone you used
to kill Abel

537
00:32:15,564 --> 00:32:17,247
because he was God's favorite.

538
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:19,916
Abel wasn't talking to God.

539
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:21,551
He was talking to Lucifer.

540
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,171
Lucifer was gonna
make my brother into his pet.

541
00:32:26,557 --> 00:32:28,508
I couldn't bear
to watch him be corrupted,

542
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,060
so I offered a deal --

543
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:35,131
Abel's soul in heaven
for my soul in hell.

544
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,484
Lucifer accepted...

545
00:32:37,486 --> 00:32:40,069
As long as I was the one
who sent Abel to heaven.

546
00:32:41,272 --> 00:32:42,856
So, I killed him.

547
00:32:42,858 --> 00:32:45,658
Became a soldier
of Hell --

548
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,144
a knight.

549
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:50,864
And Lucifer ordered you
to make more.

550
00:32:50,866 --> 00:32:54,284
My knights and I,
we did horrible things --

551
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:57,070
for centuries.

552
00:32:57,072 --> 00:33:00,657
Bringers of chaos
and darkness.

553
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,141
Then you met Colette.

554
00:33:03,427 --> 00:33:07,514
She knew who I was...
and <i>what</i> I was.

555
00:33:07,516 --> 00:33:11,601
She loved me
unconditionally.

556
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:13,603
She forgave me.

557
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:16,656
She only asked
for one thing.

558
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:19,392
To stop.

559
00:33:19,394 --> 00:33:23,863
When the knights found out,
they took retribution.

560
00:33:23,865 --> 00:33:28,318
They took Colette, so I picked
the First Blade back up,

561
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,686
and it felt so good to have it
in my hands again,

562
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:32,922
and I slaughtered
the Knights of Hell.

563
00:33:32,924 --> 00:33:34,374
Not all of them.

564
00:33:36,243 --> 00:33:37,093
No.

565
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:46,252
Colette.

566
00:33:46,254 --> 00:33:48,805
My love.

567
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:54,811
What have you done
to my wife?

568
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:57,263
Answer me, Abaddon!

569
00:33:57,265 --> 00:33:59,349
We can make this right,
can't we, Cain?

570
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:00,883
Come back to us.

571
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:02,485
Come back to <i>me.</i>

572
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:03,386
I'm done.

573
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:05,855
With the Knights
or with me?

574
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:07,890
I'm done!
Then so is she.

575
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:11,694
No. Stop it!

576
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:15,365
We could have been forever,
but you chose her.

577
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:18,284
Well, if I can't have you,
then neither can she.

578
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:24,257
Enjoying the view?
I know I am.

579
00:34:24,259 --> 00:34:25,541
Best seat in the house.

580
00:34:35,436 --> 00:34:36,853
No, Colette!

581
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:38,688
Colette, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

582
00:34:40,274 --> 00:34:42,091
I will find Abaddon,
and I will kill her.

583
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:43,893
No, there's been
enough killing.

584
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:44,861
Promise me.

585
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:47,030
You're better
than all of this.

586
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:58,992
So I buried her,
and I walked away.

587
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:02,879
We, I'm sorry --
truly.

588
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:05,381
But I have to stop
Abaddon.

589
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:08,617
So, where is the Blade?

590
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:10,970
No.

591
00:35:11,955 --> 00:35:14,307
Hey! Listen,
you son of a bitch.

592
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:16,292
You may be done killing,
but I'm not.

593
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:20,930
You never give up on anything,
do you?

594
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:22,482
Never.

595
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:26,452
Well, I do.

596
00:35:28,238 --> 00:35:30,440
Cain?

597
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:31,407
Cain?!

598
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:38,981
Well,
I'll stay as long as I can.

599
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:40,483
Aren't you a peach?

600
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:46,155
I've tried.

601
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:50,960
I've tried, Colette,
to see myself as you did.

602
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:54,047
But I know who I am --

603
00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:56,099
Seen <i>what</i> I am.

604
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:03,306
I know you
watch over me still.

605
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:05,892
But I need you
to look away now.

606
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:18,621
What the hell, man?

607
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:20,540
You in or out?
I'm getting head spins.

608
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:22,658
I can give you the mark, Dean,
if it's what you truly want.

609
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,210
What are you talking about?

610
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:26,329
The mark can be transferred
to someone who's worthy.

611
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:28,498
You mean a killer like you?

612
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,716
Yes.

613
00:36:31,535 --> 00:36:33,720
Can I use it to kill that bitch?
Yes.

614
00:36:33,722 --> 00:36:35,204
But you have to know

615
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:36,806
with the mark
comes a great burden.

616
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:38,040
Some would call it
a great cost.

617
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:39,726
Yeah, well,
spare me the warning label.

618
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:41,310
You had me
at "kill the bitch".

619
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:42,595
Good luck, Dean.

620
00:36:43,514 --> 00:36:44,680
You're gonna to need it.

621
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:47,266
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Let's dance.

622
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:54,524
Aah!

623
00:37:02,065 --> 00:37:04,083
Dean?
I'm fine.

624
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:07,954
All right, where the hell
did you stash the damn Blade?

625
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:09,255
Nothing can destroy
the Blade,

626
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:11,124
so I threw it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.

627
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:14,010
It's the only way I could
keep my promise to Colette.

628
00:37:16,431 --> 00:37:19,365
You find the blade,
kill Abaddon,

629
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,167
but make me a promise first.

630
00:37:21,169 --> 00:37:24,437
When I call you --
and I <i>will</i> call --

631
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:28,474
you come find me
and use the Blade on me.

632
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:29,659
Why?

633
00:37:29,661 --> 00:37:31,611
For what I'm
about to do.

634
00:37:46,277 --> 00:37:48,277
They're all
trapped in there.

635
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:50,246
With him.

636
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:35,330
First BladeWas that, uh...

637
00:38:35,332 --> 00:38:37,733
Was that it?

638
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:41,486
I'm afraid
there wasn't enough Grace.

639
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:45,891
We'll have to find Gadreel
another way. I'm sorry, Sam.

640
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:50,762
It's all right, Cass.

641
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:51,597
You, uh...

642
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,217
You were right.

643
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:59,271
You were right
about everything.

644
00:39:06,112 --> 00:39:07,846
Now's the part
where you hug back.

645
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,481
Oh.

646
00:39:09,483 --> 00:39:10,616
Right.

647
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:13,869
Uh, sorry.
Ah, there you go.

648
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,574
As far as I'm concerned,

649
00:39:18,576 --> 00:39:21,743
Metatron is the key to fixing
everything that's wrong.

650
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:23,595
I'm gonna find him.

651
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:34,106
You know, Sam,

652
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:35,540
we could use all the help
we could get

653
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:38,227
to find Gadreel and Metatron.

654
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:41,597
We got this.

655
00:39:56,614 --> 00:39:58,830
He <i>was</i> right,
you know.

656
00:39:58,832 --> 00:40:00,565
You <i>are</i> worthy.

657
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,719
Oh, great. Now you're gonna
get all touchy-feely, too?

658
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:05,170
Your problem, mate,

659
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:08,006
is that nobody hates you
more than you do.

660
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:10,209
Believe me, I've tried.

661
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:11,944
So, how do we find
this Blade?

662
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:14,846
You can't search the bottom
of the ocean, but <i>I</i> can.

663
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,934
So, I'll find it and
bring it to its new owner.

664
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,305
I saw you, Crowley.

665
00:40:29,312 --> 00:40:31,113
Back at Cain's.

666
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:35,567
You dusted
that undercard demon,

667
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:39,905
and then you just sat back
and watched the main event.

668
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:41,957
You knew.

669
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:45,077
You knew about the mark.
You knew about Abaddon and Cain.

670
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:47,079
You knew all of it.

671
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,163
And you played me.

672
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:49,631
Why?

673
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:52,634
He would never
have given me the Blade.

674
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:54,970
Who can say no to you?

675
00:40:54,972 --> 00:40:56,338
I needed you to play along.

676
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,273
You knew
we were being followed,

677
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:00,392
and you
didn't say anything.

678
00:41:00,394 --> 00:41:02,177
Well, Cain would want
we were to see his prize fighter

679
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:03,145
up close.

680
00:41:03,147 --> 00:41:07,649
You plus demons
equals fight night.

681
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:09,568
Tara died.

682
00:41:10,753 --> 00:41:11,687
Thanks to you.

683
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:15,324
Omelets. Broken eggs.
Et cetera.

684
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:22,147
After I kill Abaddon,
you're next!

685
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:23,582
You don't mean that.

686
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:25,617
We're having too much fun.

687
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:26,785
Listen up.

688
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:28,086
Even with the Blade,

689
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:31,723
we're gonna need all the help
we can get against Abaddon.

690
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:38,380
Go find the Blade.

691
00:41:38,382 --> 00:41:41,767
It's always something
with you boys, isn't it?
