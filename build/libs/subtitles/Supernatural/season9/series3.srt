1
00:00:02,049 --> 00:00:03,837
I'm trying to fix heaven.

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:05,337
Metatron is trying
to fix heaven.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,739
Metatron isn't trying
to fix anything.

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:08,974
He's trying to break it.

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,776
Angels.
They're falling.

6
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:12,778
Metatron -- he took my Grace.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,480
That means you're human.

8
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,648
Cass, listen to me.
There are angels out there.

9
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:18,209
They're looking for you,
and they're pissed.

10
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:23,848
Until their last breath,

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,184
they will seek revenge
on the angel that did this,

12
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:28,736
who destroyed heaven.
Stop.

13
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,521
That was beautiful,
Clarence.

14
00:00:30,523 --> 00:00:32,190
We're dealing with a reaper.

15
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:33,775
I can find you anywhere!

16
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:35,493
Sammy's hurt.
He's hurt real bad.

17
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:36,911
This one goes out to any angel.

18
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:40,665
This is Dean Winchester,
and I need your help.

19
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,216
Start with a name.
Ezekiel.

20
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:44,585
There is a chance I can fix
your brother from the inside.

21
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:45,569
What, possession?

22
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:47,004
It's the best
of a bad situation.

23
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,005
How will it work?

24
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,124
I heal Sam
while healing myself.

25
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:53,077
Sam can eject me
at any time,

26
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,213
and if Sam does eject me,
he will die.

27
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:57,414
Then we keep it a secret
for now.

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,108
Monsignor Cassidy will join us
for dinner on Saturday.

29
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,143
And mass, of course.

30
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:10,945
He can be a pain,

31
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:14,816
so let's have everybody
on their toes.

32
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:16,884
Gentlemen.

33
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:20,154
We're looking for a man
we believe you may know.

34
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:23,074
His name is Castiel.

35
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:46,230
Hey, Clarence.

36
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:48,900
How much longer
you gonna be with us?

37
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:51,986
I'll be moving on tonight
after work.

38
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:54,655
It's time.

39
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,974
Can I ask you something?

40
00:01:56,976 --> 00:01:58,276
Sure.

41
00:01:58,278 --> 00:02:01,979
Do you ever tire
of urinating?

42
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:04,749
I'll never get used to it.

43
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:14,842
Yeah, I got some more bags
for you.

44

00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,417
Sam!

47
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:16,086
You here?

48
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:18,472
Hey. Morning.

49
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:21,308
You been outside already?

50
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,977
Yeah.
Woke up, went for a run.

51
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,295
Beautiful sunrise.

52
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:28,932
Anyways, cleaned up.
Went and got breakfast.

53
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:31,635
Grabbed you real bacon and eggs,
extra grease.

54
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:32,936
Not even gonna argue.

55
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:35,639
Mm, perfect.

56
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,610
Wait.

57
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:41,361
You went running?

58
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:44,198
What?
Why do you look so worried?

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,666
Let's see.
There's Cass,

60
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:47,484
who I told
to haul ass here.

61
00:03:47,486 --> 00:03:49,819
That was days ago.
He's still out there.

62
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:50,704
Um, there's you.

63
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:54,024
Me?
I feel great.

64
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:58,328
I'm sure you do, but, Sam,
you went through the trials.

65
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,163
Okay, that put
a big strain on you.

66
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:02,299
I just think it's better
if you took it easy,

67
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:04,384
you know,
and didn't act like you were --

68
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:05,435
possessed by an angel.

69
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:08,855
And he <i>does</i> feel better.

70
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:12,609
A work in progress, of course,
but I am slowly healing him.

71
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,062
That's great.

72
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:16,113
Um, but --

73
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:17,648
I have news.

74
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,500
I've picked up chatter
among the angels.

75
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:23,453
Not all are wandering around
in confusion.

76
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:25,239
Yeah, some of 'em
are after Cass.

77
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:30,360
There is a faction
that is rapidly organizing

78
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:32,696
and finding human vessels
to contain them.

79
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:33,914
Led by Naomi?

80
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,999
I have not heard
that name, no.

81
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,218
But it is this faction's
leadership

82
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,803
who want Castiel found.

83
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:44,441
You see, Dean,
I can be useful.

84
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:47,761
So can my brother.

85
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:50,681
So, why don't you go
check your e-mail,

86
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:52,482
and if I need your help,
I'll let you know.

87
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:54,067
Dean.
I said I'll let you know.

88
00:04:56,354 --> 00:05:00,824
I mean, you know,
Cass is human now.

89
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:04,077
It's gonna take him
a lot longer to travel.

90
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,946
I'm gonna get whiplash.

91
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,247
What?

92
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:08,832
Nothing.

93
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,734
Um, all right,
so, I was thinking

94
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:13,003
that if the angels
<i>are</i> organizing,

95
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:16,256
then that makes them a lot more
dangerous than we thought.

96
00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:18,458
Why do you think
they're organizing?

97
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:23,930
It makes sense.

98
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:27,718
My point is, is that the more
of them that are after Cass,

99
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,221
the worse it is,
so...We got to find him.

100
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:35,025
<i>Folks,</i>
<i>like I've been telling you,</i>

101
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:36,727
<i>we're in that most sacred</i>
<i>of times.</i>

102
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:39,646
<i>A legion of angels</i>
<i>reaches out for us.</i>

103
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:42,399
<i>Can you feel</i>
<i>their divine presence?</i>

104
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:46,153
<i>And if you do,</i>
<i>there's nothing to fear.</i>

105
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:47,154
<i>Heck no.</i>

106
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:49,773
<i>If the angels</i>
<i>come a-knocking,</i>

107
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:52,209
<i>you just let 'em on in</i>

108
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:55,796
<i>and fill yourself up</i>
<i>with their Grace.</i>

109
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:57,947
<i>This is</i>
<i>the Reverend Buddy Boyle</i>

110
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,501
<i>in the "goin' for glory hour"</i>
<i>wishing you a most blessed day.</i>

111
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:04,254
<i>Amen.</i>

112
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:06,790
And we're clear.

113
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,259
Beautiful, buddy.
One of your best.

114
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,261
Oh, well,
that is high praise, sir,

115
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:14,231
seeing as how you're an emissary
of the man upstairs himself.

116
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,399
Thank you, Bart.

117
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:17,901
It's Bartholomew,

118
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:20,404
and I have to say,

119
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:22,906
God has
personally assured me

120
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:26,159
that he is highly pleased
with your work.

121
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:27,994
He prepareth
a special reward

122
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:30,764
for helping him populate
a true heaven on earth.

123
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,466
Well, between you and me,

124
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:36,420
it's practically reward enough
being one of the few humans

125
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:39,172
of all time to get orders
from an actual angel.

126
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:42,959
But if he prepareth
I am honored.

127
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:45,595
Terrific.

128
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:47,013
Sir? I'm ready.

129
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:49,883
Oh?

130
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:52,335
Let me be a vessel
for the divine.

131
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:56,356
I give myself over to you.

132
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:59,810
Oh. Hallelujah.

133
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:02,362
Yes.

134
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:04,648
Well...

135
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,566
If you're certain.

136
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:43,737
Aah! Oh!

137
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:49,326
Bart!

138
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:52,028
What the hell?

139
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,030
Buddy...

140
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:57,567
The simple truth is,

141
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:58,785
not all who are willing

142
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:01,171
are designed
to contain heaven's Grace.

143
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,908
We have to expect a casualty
now and then.

144
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,795
It's a small price to pay
when you think about it.

145
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:13,583
Like the lamb
of the sacrifice.

146
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:15,685
Sure.

147
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:18,171
All right, so this is where
Cass called from on Tuesday --

148
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:20,207
Longmont, Colorado.

149
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,025
Each circle is how far
he might have gotten

150
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:23,527
in one, two,
and three days out.

151
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:24,561
Okay.

152
00:08:24,563 --> 00:08:25,562
Here we go.

153
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:28,281
The same day he called
from Longmont,

154
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:29,983
weird murder, same town.

155
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:32,602
Cops said it was like the girl
was blasted from the inside out.

156
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:33,820
Angel kill.

157
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:37,657
They might have
just missed Cass.

158
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,992
Unless they got him.

159
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:45,615
You got an Emory Park, Iowa?

160
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:48,802
Emory Park, Emory Park.
I just saw that.

161
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:50,804
Yeah, a couple days outside
of Longmont.

162
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:54,040
Okay, because two priests
were murdered there Thursday.

163
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,459
Eyes blown out,
evidence of torture.

164
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,461
They were impaled on posts.

165
00:08:58,463 --> 00:08:59,946
Torture?
Yeah.

166
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:02,399
Angels are looking
for info.

167
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:04,601
Man, if they get to him
before we do...

168
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:05,735
Yeah.

169
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:08,188
Thank you.

170
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,973
I was so hungry.

171
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:12,025
Very kind of you to share.

172
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:14,411
It's okay.

173
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:16,162
You know,
I'm finding that often

174
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,982
people with the least to give
are the most generous.

175
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:21,317
Anyway...

176
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,754
I've got to plan better.

177
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:28,124
I ran out of food
very quickly today.

178
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:31,795
You're new at this,
aren't you?

179
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:35,599
Food.

180
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:38,101
Sleep or passing gas,

181
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:40,103
it's all very strange.

182
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:46,293
And it's occurred to me
that one day I'm gonna die.

183
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:53,116
Well...

184
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:56,236
I better try
falling asleep.

185
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:58,471
It's quite a process,
isn't it?

186
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,874
Try counting sheep.

187
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:06,413
Thanks once again.

188
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:34,641
What sheep?

189
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,425
Aah! Ah.

190
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:11,061
You're human?

191
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:38,548
Yeah. Yeah, I think I know
this guy you're talking about.

192
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,635
Sounds like Clarence.
Clarence?

193
00:11:41,637 --> 00:11:43,954
The church --
it runs a shelter in town,

194
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:44,888
and we work here.

195
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,256
We earn our keep.

196
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:49,559
Clarence spent a couple nights,
and then had to move on.

197
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:52,128
And he left the day the bodies
were found?

198
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,064
Matter of fact.

199
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,850
Oh, man, those poor guys
were a mess.

200
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,017
They must have suffered bad.

201
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,336
But at least now they're
with the angels.

202
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:05,605
I sure as hell hope not.

203
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:08,976
Clarence happen to mention
where he was headed?

204
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,277
No.

205
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,029
He just said he always
had to keep going.

206
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:17,317
All right.
Well, he's definitely been here.

207
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,885
Good news is
he's getting cagey.

208
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:20,570
He's using a fake name --
Clarence.

209
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:23,957
That's what Meg
used to call him.

210
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:25,959
Of course, he doesn't get
that's the name

211
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:27,044
of a pretty famous angel.

212
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,696
What?

213
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,365
"It's A Wonderful Life."

214
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,966
Dude, seriously?

215
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:35,135
What'd <i>you</i> come up with?

216
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:38,605
Another angel kill,

217
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:40,057
outside a town
called Lafayette

218
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,391
about a day's travel
east of here.

219
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,476
What is that, Indiana?

220
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:45,262
Yeah. Body was found
in a homeless camp.

221
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,314
Insides barbecued,
the whole nine.

222
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:48,231
Homeless guy?

223
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,818
No, a pharmacist
from Dayton.

224
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,521
Huh.

225
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:38,165
Reverend Boyle's influence
is astonishing.

226
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,484
I'll never understand
these people.

227
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,753
Our fallen
brothers and sisters

228
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,822
are finding vessels
faster than we'd even hoped.

229
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,940
They better.

230
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:50,043
And then they need to help us
find Castiel.

231
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:54,297
You know, the one you let slip
through your fingers.

232
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,250
Our Dayton operative
is tracking him.

233
00:13:57,252 --> 00:14:02,439
Good, because frankly,
you're hanging by a thread.

234
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:08,728
What?

235
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,299
Our operative did manage
to find Castiel,

236
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:16,403
but Castiel was somehow
able to kill him.

237
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:17,988
What?

238
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,659
He's a madman, sir,
and very dangerous.

239
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,912
No.
<i>I'm</i> very dangerous.

240
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:31,218
Now you will find this madman,
and you will destroy him.

241
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,669
Do <i>you</i> understand?

242
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,087
That may not be possible,
sir.

243
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:36,423
I'm getting a little tired
of you.

244
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:38,575
Castiel has vanished.

245
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,293
We're unable to track him.

246
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:42,379
He must have found a way
to ward himself against us.

247
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,366
Please, Lord.

248
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:57,254
Mike is such a good man.

249
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,423
Please send your angels
to heal him.

250
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:05,762
Thank you for hearing me.

251
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,932
Amen.

252
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:19,226
Mike is your husband?

253
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:24,831
He's very sick.

254
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:31,871
Yes.
Humans -- so fragile.

255
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:36,927
I never -- never realized
how fragile until recently.

256
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:41,281
I guess that's why we pray.

257
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:44,551
When you get dealt
such a bad hand sometimes,

258
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:47,971
you need something stronger
than yourself.

259
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:53,476
That's a wonderful idea,
but...

260
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,984
What?

261
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,604
What if you
were to find out

262
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,407
that no one is listening?

263
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,442
That God
had pretty much left,

264
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:13,463
that Heaven
had gone out of business?

265
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,365
What would you do?

266
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,952
But that's not possible.

267
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,155
I think
it's completely possible.

268
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:25,091
You're missing the point.

269
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:30,130
It's not possible
because I have my faith.

270
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,098
But when I tell you
the truth --

271
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,219
Your truth, not mine.

272
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,974
Your lack of faith
doesn't cancel what I believe.

273
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,526
That's not how it works.

274
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,247
You know...

275
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:52,702
I think you might feel better
if you tried it my way.

276
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:56,072
Someone <i>is</i> listening.

277
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:04,664
The issue is,

278
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,717
he somehow managed to ward
himself against us.

279
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:11,638
Our ability to track him
has been jammed,

280
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,723
which brings us to you.

281
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:18,511
My kind, we <i>always</i> get what
we're looking for, chief.

282
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:19,813
Yes, reapers.

283
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:23,683
But some of you
have taken your skill set

284
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,485
to a whole new level...

285
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:26,453
That's the rumor.

286
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,488
...and are willing
to freelance.

287
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,623
For a price.

288
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:34,861
That's the rumor.

289
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:41,201
Jump start me.

290
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:45,221
How do I start looking
for this...Castiel?

291
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:49,008
I got one word for you.

292
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,211
Winchester.

293
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,079
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

294
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:56,683
Vic had a stab wound,
but it's not what killed him.

295
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:58,635
It's like his insides were --

296
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,687
Vaporized?

297
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,056
It's been going around.

298
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:07,093
So, this guy was a pharmacist
from Ohio?

299
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:08,395
Apparently.

300
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,562
Total family man, religious.

301
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:11,231
One day, just hops
in the S.U.V., takes off,

302
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,066
dies under a bridge here
from God knows what.

303
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,119
This is his stuff.

304
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,120
Help yourselves.

305
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,072
Thanks.
Thanks.

306
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:29,615
Anything?

307
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:31,501
Nothing weird.

308
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,004
Crappy music, a lot of podcasts,
all the same one.

309
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:38,174
Reverend Buddy Boyle's
"Goin' For Glory Hour."

310
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,643
Cop said he was religious.

311
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:45,648
<i>Join me in a heapin' helpin'</i>
<i>of glory, friends.</i>

312
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:50,353
<i>When you're in the presence of</i>
<i>the divine, you'll know it.</i>

313
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,857
<i>And if you let yourself,</i>
<i>you'll hear it.</i>

314
00:19:55,994 --> 00:20:02,449
<i>So, remember, when angels come</i>
<i>a-knocking, let 'em on in.</i>

315
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:07,921
Angels can't possess a human
without permission, right?

316
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:10,323
Yep.

317
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,158
So, what, they're using this guy
to find vessels?

318
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,426
It's a willing audience.

319
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:16,262
They're all religious types
like our pharmacist here.

320
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:19,466
Buddy Boyle was telling them to
let the angels take them over.

321
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,517
Like body snatchers.

322
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,353
How big a reach
does this Boyle guy have?

323
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:37,183
Pretty much
the entire planet.

324
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:10,724
I'm not stealing.

325
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:13,360
And I'm not a cop.

326
00:21:13,362 --> 00:21:16,046
It's a shame, isn't it?

327
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:20,933
So much is wasted
when there's so many hungry.

328
00:21:20,935 --> 00:21:22,202
I never knew.

329
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:26,723
Peanut butter and jelly?

330
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,444
It's pretty good.

331
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:33,696
No, I can't take your food.

332
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:37,349
You're not.
I'm giving it to you.

333
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:43,206
Look, I've had
hard times myself.

334
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:49,212
Thank you.

335
00:21:49,214 --> 00:21:51,497
Yeah.

336
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:56,869
Look,
for the billionth time,

337
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:58,755
we're just looking
for some information, okay?

338
00:21:58,757 --> 00:21:59,672
We're not cops.

339
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:01,007
I mean,
do we look like cops?

340
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,761
Yes.

341
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:06,312
Well, we're <i>not</i> cops.

342
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:09,482
We just need to find a friend
who's in it deep.

343
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:12,985
Look, he might have been here
the night that guy was killed.

344
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:14,520
Were any of you here then?

345
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:15,521
Maybe.

346
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:16,773
Oh, okay.

347
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:18,057
Uh, he's --

348
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,077
he's got dark hair,
blue eyes,

349
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,662
a little out of it.

350
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:25,698
He maybe called himself
Clarence?

351
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,283
Clarence, yeah.

352
00:22:27,285 --> 00:22:29,669
You two talk?

353
00:22:29,671 --> 00:22:31,671
Not much.

354
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:34,340
And...?

355
00:22:34,342 --> 00:22:36,575
I think he was on the run.

356
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:40,129
You see him with the vic?
Uh, victim?

357
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:42,682
No.

358
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:45,435
Okay.

359
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:49,305
He went off to sleep
in another part of the resort.

360
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:51,607
Where?

361
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,576
He's not there now.

362
00:22:55,062 --> 00:22:56,612
Where'd he go?

363
00:22:56,614 --> 00:23:01,767
I saw him running from under
the bridge to the highway.

364
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:04,620
You gonna pay us
for all this teeth pulling?

365
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:05,938
Where was he headed?

366
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,957
He flagged a truck
heading north.

367
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,075
Detroit, probably.

368
00:23:09,077 --> 00:23:10,243
Why Detroit?

369
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:12,795
Truck was marked
"Motor City Meats."

370
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,177
Whoo!

371
00:23:44,211 --> 00:23:46,478
Wow, it's beautiful.

372
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,649
If you say so.

373
00:23:50,651 --> 00:23:52,535
Uh, just so you know,

374
00:23:52,537 --> 00:23:56,155
I don't usually bring home
strange men.

375
00:23:56,157 --> 00:23:58,841
Am I strange?

376
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:03,495
No, I mean...
Men I don't know.

377
00:24:04,848 --> 00:24:07,683
But you look like you been
to hell and back.

378
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:11,503
Yeah, a few times.

379
00:24:11,505 --> 00:24:14,640
April, by the way.
April Kelly.

380
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:17,176
Um, Castiel.

381
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:19,028
One name?

382
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,780
Yeah, like God.

383
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:23,533
Or Cher?

384
00:24:24,701 --> 00:24:27,486
Uh, not to raise
any red flags,

385
00:24:27,488 --> 00:24:31,290
but do you know your shirt's
soaked in blood?

386
00:24:35,195 --> 00:24:37,863
Look at these chemicals.
Do you even read the label?

387
00:24:37,865 --> 00:24:38,864
No. I read "pie."

388
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:40,750
The rest is just
"blah, blah, blah."

389
00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:42,201
Listen,
when we hit Detroit,

390
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:44,220
we start with
the homeless shelters.

391
00:24:44,222 --> 00:24:46,672
Right, then go to the
encampments, soup kitchens.

392
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:49,642
Check out places that he might
have gone looking for work.

393
00:24:49,644 --> 00:24:52,228
Yeah, and I can -- I can check
for vagrancy arrests.

394
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,932
Yeah, and, you know...
Odd deaths.

395
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:20,506
Who are you?!

396
00:25:20,508 --> 00:25:21,958
Why are you trailing us?

397
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,077
You call this rag
a bandage?

398
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,464
You're lucky
this wasn't infected.

399
00:25:28,466 --> 00:25:32,301
What happened to the guy
who attacked you?

400
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:34,971
Oh, I stabbed him.

401
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:39,141
He exploded.

402
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,145
Funny.

403
00:25:43,147 --> 00:25:46,482
You don't look like
the knife-fight type.

404
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:49,902
Or the homeless type,
actually.

405
00:25:49,904 --> 00:25:55,825
Yes. Well...I guess
I trusted the wrong person.

406
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:58,911
Bad investment advice?

407
00:25:58,913 --> 00:26:01,881
No, vanity.

408
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:07,119
I thought I was more important,
more effective than I am,

409
00:26:07,121 --> 00:26:10,923
that I could...
Fix everything.

410
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:14,510
And now all I can do
is keep running.

411
00:26:16,596 --> 00:26:17,796
Well, all patched up,

412
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:20,349
but, God,
your delts are in knots.

413
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:22,735
You got to relax.

414
00:26:22,737 --> 00:26:26,138
Ah, it's all new to me.

415
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,190
Hunger.

416
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:31,193
Cold.

417
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:37,316
This feeling,
being all alone.

418
00:26:37,318 --> 00:26:40,486
You're not alone tonight.

419
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:15,788
So, Maurice.

420
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,407
You bounty hunters are like
Delta Force reapers.

421
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:20,242
Why would they sic you
on Cass?

422
00:27:20,244 --> 00:27:23,596
He warded himself.

423
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:26,031
Naomi hire you?

424
00:27:28,969 --> 00:27:33,139
You really <i>are</i>
out of the loop.

425
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:34,840
Naomi's dead.

426
00:27:34,842 --> 00:27:37,576
Resting in pieces.

427
00:27:37,578 --> 00:27:40,146
So then who's running
things now?

428
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:43,399
Answer!

429
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:48,154
Her prot?g?, Bartholomew.
He's an up-and-comer.

430
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:51,490
So he figured
we'd lead you to Cass.

431
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:55,277
This Bartholomew,
he organizing the angels?

432
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:02,251
That's all I know.

433
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:12,044
You can kill me.
It won't matter.

434
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:15,514
If I don't find Castiel,
there are others that will.

435
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:18,551
But do what you want.

436
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:22,188
Sure.

437
00:28:30,697 --> 00:28:32,931
Well, say <i>something.</i>

438
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:38,104
There aren't words.

439
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:41,140
So, that was okay?

440
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:43,509
Very much so.

441
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:46,979
Um...

442
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:49,265
What I did,
that was, uh...

443
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:52,368
...correct?

444
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,386
Very much so.

445
00:28:54,388 --> 00:28:56,472
Good.

446
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:59,458
Good.

447
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:02,794
Castiel...

448
00:29:02,796 --> 00:29:05,347
I can't help thinking

449
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:11,303
all that stuff you said earlier,
blame and guilt?

450
00:29:13,107 --> 00:29:15,574
It seems like
you're taking on a heavy load

451
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:16,808
for such a sweet guy.

452
00:29:19,664 --> 00:29:24,533
Believe me, I've done a lot
of foolish, unwise things.

453
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,455
I'm no angel.

454
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:35,878
Well,
whoever you trusted...

455
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,647
Can't they help undo this?

456
00:29:41,251 --> 00:29:43,986
We're not in contact.

457
00:29:43,988 --> 00:29:47,489
So what happens next
for you?

458
00:29:47,491 --> 00:29:50,976
More of <i>this,</i> I hope.

459
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:22,424
Oh.
I washed your stuff.

460
00:30:22,426 --> 00:30:23,809
Find everything okay?

461
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:26,762
As a matter of fact,
something <i>is</i> missing.

462
00:30:26,764 --> 00:30:28,898
Oh?
It was with my jacket.

463
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,316
It's hard to describe.

464
00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:32,217
Oh, you mean this?

465
00:30:47,998 --> 00:30:49,832
What's up?

466
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,348
We been chasing our tails
all night.

467
00:30:54,349 --> 00:30:55,448
No Cass.

468
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,500
"What's up?"
I'm fried.

469
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:03,740
I think it's time
for plan "B."

470
00:31:06,844 --> 00:31:08,962
I'm not following.

471
00:31:08,964 --> 00:31:11,631
I'm letting you know.

472
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:14,017
O-okay.

473
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:17,437
Um, letting me know what?

474
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:20,607
I'm letting you know.

475
00:31:29,283 --> 00:31:31,201
What is it, Dean?

476
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:33,603
I need your help.

477
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:36,489
That is flattering.
We've been through this.

478
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:38,074
I cannot be making
public appearances.

479
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:39,392
Oh, I understand that.

480
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:40,943
I'm not asking you to walk
the red carpet, Zeke, okay?

481
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:42,162
I need your help
finding Cass.

482
00:31:42,164 --> 00:31:46,249
It cannot be done.
He is warded.

483
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:48,468
I know that,
but maybe you can use

484
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,287
your intergalactic, hyperspace,
X-ray eyeballs

485
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:52,806
to find someone else.

486
00:31:54,642 --> 00:31:57,594
There might be a reaper
for rent on his ass.

487
00:31:57,596 --> 00:31:58,895
Could you find them?

488
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:01,398
I could try.

489
00:32:09,156 --> 00:32:10,240
It's probably pointless,

490
00:32:10,242 --> 00:32:12,492
washing the blood out
of your shirt, really.

491
00:32:12,494 --> 00:32:15,195
It's the kind of thing
the real April would have done.

492
00:32:15,197 --> 00:32:18,815
Mm. I miss being her.

493
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:20,250
Very sweet.

494
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:22,202
Didn't mind me
entering her one bit.

495
00:32:22,204 --> 00:32:24,671
Why didn't you just attack me
right away?

496
00:32:24,673 --> 00:32:28,157
My briefing said you were
dangerous and powerful.

497
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,844
And you did arrive armed,
so...

498
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,032
I needed information,
so I had to gain your trust.

499
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:38,935
And that required
intercourse?

500
00:32:40,522 --> 00:32:46,443
Well, I am allowed <i>some</i> leeway
for executive decisions.

501
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:51,815
And I can't say
I didn't find you attractive.

502
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:55,118
Who hired you?

503
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,122
I assumed with Naomi gone,
things were in chaos.

504
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:02,792
New sheriff in town, Cass.

505
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:05,161
He hired a bunch of us.

506
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:06,162
I got lucky.

507
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:14,704
Enough questions from you.
I have several of my own.

508
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:17,340
Let's talk about your buddy
Metatron.

509
00:33:22,397 --> 00:33:24,547
All right,
let's try this again,

510
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:26,716
and one of these times,
we'll get it right.

511
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:29,486
I knew nothing
about Metatron's spell.

512
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:33,106
I didn't know he was gonna cast
the angels out of Heaven.

513
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:36,192
I was cast out, too.
Oh, dear.

514
00:33:36,194 --> 00:33:38,528
Nothing but reruns
on <i>this</i> channel.

515
00:33:39,614 --> 00:33:43,199
These blades are marvelous,
aren't they?

516
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:46,736
They really do a number
on humans, too.

517
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:50,123
I told you last night,
and I meant it.

518
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:51,291
I was naive.

519
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:54,460
I had no idea
what he was planning.

520
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:56,679
You're lying.

521
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:58,681
It's known you helped Metatron
enter Heaven,

522
00:33:58,683 --> 00:33:59,849
collaborated with him.

523
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:02,752
'Cause we were going
to restore Heaven,

524
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:05,138
bring the factions
together.

525
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:10,310
He lied to me.

526
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:12,445
You were with him
when he unleashed the spell.

527
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:14,314
You know how the angels
were cast down!

528
00:34:14,316 --> 00:34:16,900
I didn't know
he was assembling a spell.

529
00:34:16,902 --> 00:34:20,820
I only knew that I was
the final ingredient.

530
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:23,656
You?

531
00:34:23,658 --> 00:34:26,492
My Grace.

532
00:34:26,494 --> 00:34:28,127
That's why I'm human.

533
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:30,797
He took my Grace
for the spell.

534
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:33,616
Or you <i>gave</i> it.

535
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:37,170
It may be unwise
to kill me.

536
00:34:37,172 --> 00:34:40,957
If my Grace were the key
to empowering the spell,

537
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:43,560
I may be key
to countering it.

538
00:34:43,562 --> 00:34:45,645
Are you negotiating with me,
Castiel?

539
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:49,065
Cass!

540
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:08,317
This girl's popular
with all the boys.

541
00:35:24,635 --> 00:35:26,603
Cass. Cass.

542
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:29,222
Cass!

543
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:32,642
Cass!

544
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:35,361
No.

545
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,711
Sam, he's gone.

546
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:32,568
Dean.

547
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,787
Hey.

548
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:36,622
Hey! Yeah.

549
00:36:41,295 --> 00:36:43,296
And Sam.

550
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:47,100
Cass. You okay?

551
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:56,442
Never do that again!

552
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:59,145
All right.

553
00:36:59,147 --> 00:37:01,364
But I'm confused.

554
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:03,933
I know she stabbed me,

555
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:08,454
but I'm -- well,
I don't appear to be dead.

556
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:14,160
Well, you got dinged.

557
00:37:15,212 --> 00:37:18,965
And, uh, you.

558
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:20,466
I made a deal with her.

559
00:37:20,468 --> 00:37:24,003
Said she wouldn't get kabobed
if she brought you back.

560
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:28,007
She brought you back.

561
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:32,011
You lied.

562
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:34,463
I did.

563
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:35,848
I do that.

564
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,791
You know, you never answered
my question.

565
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:53,141
How did you know
where to find Cass?

566
00:37:53,143 --> 00:37:54,142
I told you.

567
00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:56,144
I went through
Maurice's pockets.

568
00:37:56,146 --> 00:37:58,496
I found an address
and took a shot.

569
00:37:58,498 --> 00:38:00,949
I never saw you go through
Maurice's pockets.

570
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:02,417
What are you
talking about?

571
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:04,753
I don't see half of
the nerdy stuff that you do.

572
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:06,671
It doesn't mean that
you don't do nerdy stuff.

573
00:38:06,673 --> 00:38:09,657
I am really
enjoying this place.

574
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:11,576
Plentiful food.

575
00:38:11,578 --> 00:38:14,045
Good water pressure.

576
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:17,882
Things I never even
considered before.

577
00:38:17,884 --> 00:38:20,885
There really is a lot
to being human, isn't there?

578
00:38:20,887 --> 00:38:24,472
It ain't all just burritos
and strippers, my friend.

579
00:38:24,474 --> 00:38:26,841
Yeah.

580
00:38:26,843 --> 00:38:28,810
I understand
what you're saying.

581
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:30,478
You do?

582
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,816
Yes, there's more to humanity
than survival.

583
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:38,103
You...look for purpose,

584
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:43,441
and you must not be defeated
by anger or despair.

585
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:45,527
Or hedonism,
for that matter.

586
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:48,613
Where does hedonism
come into it?

587
00:38:48,615 --> 00:38:52,634
Well, my time with April
was very educational.

588
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:54,502
Yeah. I mean,

589
00:38:54,504 --> 00:38:56,504
I would think that getting
killed is something.

590
00:38:57,624 --> 00:38:59,740
And having sex.

591
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:02,410
You had sex with April?

592
00:39:02,412 --> 00:39:04,879
Yeah, that would be
where the hedonism comes in.

593
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:06,131
Shh.

594
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:12,086
So...

595
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:14,322
Did you have protection?

596
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:17,425
I had my angel blade.

597
00:39:17,427 --> 00:39:20,695
Oh --
oh, he had the Angel blade.

598
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:22,697
Um...

599
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:24,466
In any event, I --

600
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:28,236
I do now see how difficult
life can be

601
00:39:28,238 --> 00:39:31,639
and how well you two
have led it.

602
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:35,376
And I think
you'll be great teachers.

603
00:39:35,378 --> 00:39:38,246
Thanks. Cass.

604
00:39:38,248 --> 00:39:41,549
Are there
any more burritos?

605
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:43,835
Uh, yes.

606
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,958
Our little Cass.

607
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,511
He gave it up to a reaper.
That is --

608
00:39:53,513 --> 00:39:54,979
Castiel cannot stay here.

609
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:58,600
He will bring the angels down
on all of us.

610
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:01,069
No, no, he's got
the Enochian tattoo.

611
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:01,986
He's warded.

612
00:40:01,988 --> 00:40:05,139
He was warded
when April found him,

613
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:06,807
and she killed him.

614
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:09,310
Yes,
and you brought him back,

615
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:12,747
and I thank you for that,
but this is Cass,

616
00:40:12,749 --> 00:40:14,749
okay, who vouched for you

617
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:17,652
when I didn't know you
from Jack.

618
00:40:17,654 --> 00:40:19,787
The bunker is safe.

619
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:23,324
Bartholomew is massing
a force.

620
00:40:23,326 --> 00:40:26,711
We cannot stand
an incursion.

621
00:40:26,713 --> 00:40:28,363
Castiel is in danger,

622
00:40:28,365 --> 00:40:31,983
and if he is here,
<i>I</i> am in danger.

623
00:40:31,985 --> 00:40:35,836
<i>You're</i> in danger?
From who, the angels?

624
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:39,440
If he stays,

625
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:42,193
I am afraid I will have
no choice but to leave.

626
00:40:42,195 --> 00:40:44,028
Oh, no, you can't do <i>that.</i>

627
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,332
Sam's not well enough.
If you leave his body...

628
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:48,733
I know.

629
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:52,203
I am sorry.

630
00:40:56,909 --> 00:41:00,962
Epic food.
I can't get enough.

631
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:04,249
Cass, uh, can we talk?

632
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:06,301
Of course.

633
00:41:08,371 --> 00:41:11,506
Dean, you know I always
appreciate our talks,

634
00:41:11,508 --> 00:41:13,040
our time together.

635
00:41:16,228 --> 00:41:18,396
Listen, buddy.

636
00:41:18,398 --> 00:41:20,548
Um...

637
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,584
You can't stay.

638
