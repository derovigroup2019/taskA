1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:05,161
Dead man's blood --
it's poison to vampires.

2
00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:08,764
And most of the vampires lore
is crap.

3
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:12,001
The only way to kill them
is by beheading.

4
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:13,536
Hey, Dean.
Jody Mills.

5
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:16,272
Jody, are you sure you're, uh,
ready to jump back in the fray?

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,676
This wackadoo stuff
keeps coming.

7
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:23,880
More I know,
better armed I'll be.

8
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:24,991
Did you...Get --

9
00:00:25,016 --> 00:00:25,682
Born again?

10
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:26,322
Yeah.

11
00:00:26,347 --> 00:00:28,318
I don't make promises
I can't keep.

12
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,952
I enjoy church.

13
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:33,923
I mean, after my son
and my husband...

14
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:39,528
...I needed something
that made sense to me.

15
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:52,842
All right, Missy,
calm down!

16
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,211
Let me go!

17
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:57,280
Calm down!

18
00:00:57,282 --> 00:00:59,282
Let me out!

19
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:06,989
Hey, Frank, someone
smashed the front window

20
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:09,725
over at Dawson's Hardware --
possible B&E.

21
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:11,227
Need you to check it out.

22
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:13,763
Yeah, copy that,
but the bullpen's empty,

23
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:15,298
and I got someone
in holding.

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,166
Sheriff's heading
to the station now.

25
00:01:17,168 --> 00:01:18,267
They won't be alone long.

26
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,303
Roger that.
I'm heading out.

27
00:01:20,305 --> 00:01:22,805
Hey, don't leave me.

28
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:25,641
Please.

29
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,709
Cody.

30
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:01,377
There you are, girl.

31
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,312
How did you find me?
Come on.

32
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:05,381
You don't really need
to ask that, do you?

33
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:08,484
A-are the others with you?

34
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:10,753
Everyone was off on a hunt when
I'd realized you'd run away.

35
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,321
Figured I'd do you
and them a favor

36
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:13,289
and come take care of this

37
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,790
before they even know
we're gone.

38
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:17,193
You can't get me in here.

39
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:28,671
Cop sure was in a hurry to
check out that "B&E" I faked.

40
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:33,142
Barely even saw me coming.

41
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,445
I keep telling you --

42
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:41,350
you can run and you can hide,
but we will always find you.

43
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:57,797

45
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:14,050
You boys are a sight.

46
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:16,519
Jody.

47
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:18,254
How's the shoulder?

48
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:20,289
Eh, only aches when it rains.

49
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,590
How you boys been?

50
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:24,527
Peachy.
Touch and go.

51
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:26,095
I know the feeling.

52
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:28,297
So, what you got for us?

53
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:42,378
Yeah, uh, that's a vamp,
all right.

54
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:44,780
I don't know, Sammy.

55
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:46,882
Looks like Jody might not need
our help anymore.

56
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:48,751
Oh, they grow up too fast.
Don't they?

57
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:50,152
Yeah,
joke all you want.

58
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:52,822
There's more
where this came from.

59
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:54,356
More?

60
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:56,125
My men brought in a runaway
last night.

61
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:58,294
There's no I.D. on her --
nothing on her, actually,

62
00:03:58,296 --> 00:04:00,129
except for a bus ticket
out of Nebraska.

63
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,264
Total Jane Doe.
She won't even give me her name.

64
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,732
Girl's basically feral.

65
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:05,034
She's got zero manners,

66
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,470
didn't even thank me
for saving her.

67
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:11,073
Anyhow, this thing went to
plenty of trouble to get at her.

68
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:12,575
And to hear him tell it,

69
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:15,845
the "others" will want her
at least as bad as he did.

70
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:17,646
Sounds like a nest.
Yeah.

71
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:19,014
Nest?

72
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:22,485
I'm guessing that's not half
as cute and cozy as it sounds.

73
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:25,354
Oh, I'm afraid not.

74
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:33,696
Wilson and Fisher?

75
00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:37,066
You two are FBI,
then I'm Taylor Swift.

76
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,135
That wasn't a dental I.D.

77
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:42,338
It was a fang check.
You're hunters.

78
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:50,045
And you're alive because, uh,
hunters trained the sheriff.

79
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,847
I think the first words
out of your mouth

80
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,883
should be a thank you.

81
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:59,421
So, who were you
to this vamp, anyway?

82
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:03,759
Hmm?
What's so special about you?

83
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:06,362
Is there a nest?

84
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:15,504
Sorry to interrupt.
We got a match on her DNA.

85
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:23,913
Annie Jones.

86
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:27,316
Reported abducted
outside of Kenosha in '06.

87
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:29,952
Raised by
an elderly grandparent.

88
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,287
No living kin.

89
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:36,525
You think the vamps are the ones
who took her?

90
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:38,394
Eight years is a long time for
a human to live with vampires

91
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:39,562
without getting killed
or turned.

92
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:40,829
You're the experts,

93
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:42,331
but there was something...

94
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,767
familiar about the way
this vamp talked to her.

95
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:45,901
Jody's right.

96
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:48,537
And she had scars on her neck,
feeding scars.

97
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:49,772
Uh...

98
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:52,374
They're layered,

99
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,143
as if they'd been built on
for years.

100
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,378
So she's a blood slave.

101
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,846
We've seen it before --

102
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:00,716
vampires keeping people as pets,
human feedbags.

103
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:02,785
Sometimes these slaves...

104
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:03,919
Stay loyal to their captors.

105
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,854
Yeah.
Right.

106
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:07,289
So...This girl's not talking

107
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,225
'cause she's got a case
of...what?

108
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:10,759
Vampiric Stockholm syndrome?

109
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,328
She's protecting the nest.

110
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,862
So, you feel a debt.

111
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:16,465
They gave you a home,
raised you.

112
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:17,399
Annie, we get it.

113
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,101
Loyalty is
a very powerful thing.

114
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:21,303
My name is Alex.
No, it's not.

115
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:23,973
Your name is Annie Jones.

116
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:26,108
Those vampires stole you.

117
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,643
They're monsters, Annie.

118
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:29,645
Alex.
And they didn't love you.

119
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:31,013
They loved your blood.

120
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,081
They fed on you.

121
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,183
I fed them.

122
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,085
My choice.

123
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:37,386
My brothers --

124
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:40,689
they brought me food
when I was hungry.

125
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,860
So when they struck out
on a hunt, I fed them.

126
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,562
They're my family.

127
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:49,198
Okay, you care about them,

128
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,067
but, Alex...

129
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:55,571
There's a reason
you decided to run away.

130
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:57,039
It was time...

131
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,409
to move on
and get out on my own.

132
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:02,211
And how do you think
that decision

133
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,146
is gonna sit with the rest
of the nest?

134
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:05,848
One of them
already pursued you.

135
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,484
You think when the rest of them
find out that you left

136
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:11,020
that they're just gonna shrug
and cut their losses?

137
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:12,154
You lived with them
for years.

138
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:13,022
They've tasted your blood.

139
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:15,190
They have your scent
down cold.

140
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:18,761
I mean, how far can you run
and for how long?

141
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:23,399
You didn't think this out,
did you?

142
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,769
What would happen,
who might get hurt --

143
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:30,105
your, uh, "brother," for one.

144
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:34,376
His name's Cody.

145
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:38,247
And <i>she</i> killed him.

146
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,082
Because of a choice
<i>you</i> made.

147
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:44,219
These are the consequences.

148
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:48,891
You got two options --
them or you.

149
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:51,126
And we can help you.
We can keep you safe.

150
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:52,328
But you have to help us.

151
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,697
Where's the nest?

152
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,400
I can't.

153
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:04,239
After what's happened...

154
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:10,412
...mama finds me,
she'll kill me.

155
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:28,530
Mills, you okay?

156
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:29,998
No wonder
she didn't thank me.

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,166
That creep was her brother.

158
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:33,268
I'm fine.

159
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,105
You know, mostly, I'm just --
I'm hung up on the name.

160
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:38,540
Alex and Annie --
they're so close already.

161
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:39,675
Why'd they change it?

162
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:41,777
Okay, so, we know
from her ticket

163
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:44,713
that Alex hopped a bus out
of O'Neill, Nebraska, right?

164
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:45,981
Mm-hmm.

165
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,249
Obviously, it'd be better
to go in with a firm location,

166
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:48,584
but the town
ain't that big.

167
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:50,119
There are no caves
or other natural hiding places.

168
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:51,620
All right,
so go in, canvass it cold.

169
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:53,555
Well, I worked together
a short list

170
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:55,157
of possible
nest locations.

171
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,825
Uh, there's an empty
fire station,

172
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,260
four or five
derelict homes.

173
00:08:58,262 --> 00:08:59,862
Nothing we couldn't hit
in a day.

174
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:01,663
Okay.

175
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,768
You sure you're all right
to babysit by yourself?

176
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,737
Oh, well,
girl's a flight risk,

177
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:09,872
not exactly friendly,

178
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:12,074
but I think I can handle
babysitting detail.

179
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:13,175
The station's been made.

180
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,977
It might be worth heading upwind
for a while.

181
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:16,078
I mean, vamps are trackers.

182
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,280
Terrific.
Yeah.

183
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:21,683
Well, I've got an old
family cabin outside of town.

184
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:23,352
That'll work.
Okay.

185
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,421
Well, shouldn't raise
too many eyebrows,

186
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:26,588
me being gone for a day.

187
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,257
Maybe, but you, uh,
sure you don't want backup?

188
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:30,492
You want me to enlist my men

189
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:33,862
in a protection detail
against vampires?

190
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,465
Frank's still in the dark
about what hit him last night.

191
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:37,900
The guy still has nightmares

192
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:40,202
about the barn episode
of "Walking Dead""

193
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,904
They're good cops.

194
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:42,871
They're not ready for this.

195
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,273
Jody, in your
late-night reading,

196
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,975
did you ever come across
anything about Dead Man's blood?

197
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:47,976
Mnh-mnh.

198
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:51,013
It takes vamps down
like a horse tranq.

199
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:54,016
I would not say no
to some of that.

200
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,517
I mean,
not that I'll need it.

201
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,753
You guys are gonna get the jump
on these vamps

202
00:09:57,755 --> 00:09:59,021
and be back here

203
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:01,156
before they even realize
their kin's missing, right?

204
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:22,044
Well, it's not my fault.

205
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:24,913
Well, Ralph didn't show up
for work today.

206
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,949
I had to pull a double shift.

207
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:29,151
I'll be home soon.

208
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:40,796
Connor, you scared the --

209
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:43,632
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
snuck up on you like that.

210
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:45,934
It's just, you haven't seen Alex
around, have you?

211
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,171
Uh, your sister.
No, I can't say I have. Sorry.

212
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:50,472
Huh.

213
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:53,208
So you didn't sell her
a bus ticket out of town?

214
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,512
Did I help
your shut-in kid sister

215
00:10:56,514 --> 00:11:01,083
get away from her weird,
scary-ass squatter family?

216
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:02,417
Answer's still "no".

217
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:04,486
So you're saying
Ralph lied to us?

218
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:10,192
'Cause he said...that you
sold her a ticket...

219
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:13,795
...right before
we killed him.

220
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,808
You calling my family weird?

221
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:30,712
Oh, honey,
you have no idea.

222
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:56,899
What?

223
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:59,068
Too rustic for your taste?

224
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,905
Well, I have a lot
of great memories.

225
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:05,208
Used to come up here
all the time --

226
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,878
first as a kid with my parents
and then with my...

227
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:16,285
Anyhow, it's a lot nicer
than it looks from the outside.

228
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:29,399
F.Y.I. --
The woods around here --

229
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,669
really easy to get lost in if
you don't know your way around.

230
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:33,770
Me --

231
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:36,406
I know them
like the back of my hand.

232
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:37,540
I got it.

233
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,709
"Don't try running.
You won't get far".

234
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,895
You know this doesn't work,
right?

235
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:01,497
- On vampires?
- It's useless.

236
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:03,733
That's not why I have it.

237
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:04,634
Mm.

238
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:08,571
This your family?

239
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:11,340
Yes.

240
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,342
Where are they?

241
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,047
Oh. Dead.

242
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,651
You know, there are about
a thousand more polite ways

243
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:22,719
you could say that.

244
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,187
I'll give you a pass

245
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:26,255
on account of the whole
raised-by-monsters thing.

246
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:28,891
How'd they die?

247
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:32,261
Horribly.

248
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,200
You must be exhausted.

249
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:40,103
I know for a fact
you didn't sleep last night.

250
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:41,370
I'm fine.

251
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:43,306
It's no problem.
I can make up a bed.

252
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:46,209
I'm <i>fine.</i>

253
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:49,378
Suit yourself.

254
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:33,556
This place is a foreclosure,
right?

255
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,724
Yep.

256
00:14:34,726 --> 00:14:36,359
It is, just like
the rest of them.

257
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:38,161
Well, somebody's
squatting here.

258
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:39,595
Blackout windows.

259
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,246
Hey!

260
00:14:57,248 --> 00:14:59,615
Hey, you need
a hand with that?

261
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:04,086
Oh.

262
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:05,621
I guess not.

263
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:17,233
You go out with the family,
bring home a nice dinner.

264
00:15:17,235 --> 00:15:19,502
How did you get stuck
doing the dishes?

265
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:21,370
We all have our roles
to play.

266
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:23,472
Yours being destroying
the evidence, yeah?

267
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:27,009
Nice job.

268
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:29,111
Ralph Hedges. Stacy Kepler.

269
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:31,581
Any reason
you targeted them?

270
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,983
Yeah. Hunger.

271
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:36,619
And, so, the family's what?

272
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:38,888
Out taking a nice
after-dinner stroll?

273
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,491
Oh, I'm sure they'll be back
<i>real</i> soon.

274
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:47,230
What I asked was...

275
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:50,032
Where are they?

276
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:09,352
Nice shiner.

277
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:11,320
Can I help you all
with something?

278
00:16:11,322 --> 00:16:14,056
As a matter of fact...

279
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,792
I think you can.

280
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:21,497
You don't want to talk.

281
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:23,332
No skin off my back.

282
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:27,069
'Cause you see, a blood-sucking,
body-chipping vamp --

283
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:29,538
that's bad enough,
but vamps...

284
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,141
that kidnap kids...

285
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:36,679
Well, I'm going to enjoy
putting you down.

286
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:39,115
Of course.

287
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:41,884
Oh, I knew this
was about Alexis.

288
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:45,621
I warned mama

289
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:47,990
that girl would screw
everything up for us one day.

290
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:49,191
"Mama"?

291
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:52,828
As in one vamp
turned you all?

292
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,865
Well, all of us
but little sis.

293
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:59,535
She was, uh,
"too good to turn".

294
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:04,573
Mama couldn't bring herself to,
no matter what we said,

295
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:06,309
no matter how bad
Alexis got.

296
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:08,010
Bad?

297
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:11,414
Let me guess.
You never had a teenage sister.

298
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,282
Dragging her heels,

299
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:17,787
whining, near constant,
about everything,

300
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:20,389
but more and more
about the blood,

301
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:22,625
like she's somehow above it,

302
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:25,661
like she's better than us
'cause she don't feed on people.

303
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:27,830
She <i>is</i> better than you,
dumbass.

304
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:30,366
Her moping?

305
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:33,336
That teenage
crisis-of-conscience crap?

306
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:36,405
It's annoying as hell,
but it's just an act.

307
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:39,742
When the chips are down,

308
00:17:39,744 --> 00:17:43,479
she'll always choose us
over humans.

309
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:50,619
I mean, how do you think

310
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:53,656
we stayed off your radar
all these years?

311
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:58,694
Pretty, young,
lost-looking thing like her?

312
00:17:58,696 --> 00:17:59,996
Irresistible,

313
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:03,265
especially to the kind of man
few people would miss.

314
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:05,434
? I never read it in a book ?

315
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:07,670
? I never saw it on a show ?

316
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:12,141
? but I heard it in the alley
on a weird radio ?

317
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:13,642
? if you want a drink of water ?

318
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:17,913
? you got to get it
from a well ?

319
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:19,782
? if you want to get to heaven ?

320
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:23,819
? you got to raise
a little hell ?

321
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:25,755
I mean, sure, we hunt sometimes
for sport,

322
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:30,393
but it's a lot easier and a lot
safer to get delivery.

323
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:36,599
Come on, sweetie.

324
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:40,036
Aren't you gonna
give me a name?

325
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:44,874
It's...Ann.

326
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:48,010
Mm. Sweet Ann.

327
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:51,847
You got any idea
what I'm about to do to you?

328
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:54,617
Yeah. I do.

329
00:18:57,687 --> 00:19:00,322
Nothing.

330
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,291
What the...

331
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:04,994
Is this a party?

332
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:14,670
She's your lure.

333
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:16,906
Best a vamp could ask for.

334
00:19:18,142 --> 00:19:21,243
And you better believe
you don't get that good at it

335
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,678
unless you enjoy it.

336
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,380
In her own sweet way...

337
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:28,784
Girl's as bloodthirsty
as any vampire.

338
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:34,457
Jody.

339
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:48,003
Alex?

340
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,973
Alex?

341
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,816
Alex!

342
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:43,359
Whoa!

343
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:44,860
Easy.

344
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:46,996
Sorry.

345
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:48,797
Sorry.

346
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:56,038
I made you a sandwich.
It's out there if you want it.

347
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:01,377
Sheriff.

348
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:06,682
My grandma?

349
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:10,219
I'm so sorry.

350
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:13,255
No, it's -- it's fine.

351
00:21:13,257 --> 00:21:17,359
I figured -- it's been years,
and she was old.

352
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:30,272
You got it.
Thank you.

353
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:31,473
She's not answering.

354
00:21:31,475 --> 00:21:33,809
I just ran the victims' names
through local P.D.

355
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:36,312
They <i>both</i> worked
at the O'Neill bus station.

356
00:21:36,314 --> 00:21:38,547
So they killed them
for Alex's location.

357
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:42,184
Jody?

358
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:42,856
Dean, what's up?

359
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:43,874
Listen to me.

360
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,275
The vamps knew that Alex
went to Sioux Falls, okay?

361
00:21:46,276 --> 00:21:47,308
They're probably
already there.

362
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,676
We're on our way
there next.

363
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:50,278
But there's something else.
There's something about Alex.

364
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,180
It can wait.

365
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,050
They're here.

366
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:56,784
What?

367
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:58,186
At the cabin. Now.

368
00:21:58,188 --> 00:22:00,054
We're on our way.
Hurry.

369
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:01,623
She hung up.

370
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,590
We moving?

371
00:22:02,592 --> 00:22:04,692
Yeah.
Meet you outside.

372
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:21,342
Alex?

373
00:22:21,344 --> 00:22:23,811
Alex, come on.
We got to go.

374
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,615
We got to go.

375
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:28,683
Jody, help!

376
00:22:28,685 --> 00:22:30,451
Alex?!

377
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:32,654
Alex!

378
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,555
Alex!

379
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:36,424
Help me! Help!

380
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:41,229
Let me go!

381
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:49,737
Come on, let's go!

382
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,840
Move it!

383
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:14,486
Jody?

384
00:23:14,488 --> 00:23:16,521
Hey, you okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

385
00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:17,522
Where's Alex?

386
00:23:17,524 --> 00:23:19,224
You tell us.

387
00:23:19,226 --> 00:23:21,092
They came
and I tried to stop them.

388
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:22,260
And you got knocked out.

389
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:23,828
Well, happens
to the best of us.

390
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,829
Just lucky you're alive.

391
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:26,398
You think they went back
to the nest?

392
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,033
Of course they did.
Why wouldn't they?

393
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:29,634
Question is --
what are they gonna do

394
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:30,969
when they find
their brother dead?

395
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:32,137
So we go back now.

396
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:33,805
Okay. I'm coming.

397
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:36,141
Uh, Jody? Hey, hey.
Whoa.

398
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:37,442
Hold on. You're hurt.

399
00:23:37,444 --> 00:23:38,743
I'm coming.

400
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:40,078
Jody, we can handle the nest
on our own.

401
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,347
I don't give a fig
about the nest.

402
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:44,582
That girl was under
my protection.

403
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:46,318
Okay, that "girl" can't be
trusted. She's a lure.

404
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,119
She's a-a honey trap.

405
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:52,390
She's been feeding people
to those vamps!

406
00:23:52,392 --> 00:23:53,525
I don't care.

407
00:23:53,527 --> 00:23:55,660
Whatever she did,
she did because they made her.

408
00:23:55,662 --> 00:23:57,629
Oh, and that's a reason?
She's a kid!

409
00:23:57,631 --> 00:23:59,731
Yeah, a kid who's been playing
vampire murder

410
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:01,132
since before
she was in braces.

411
00:24:01,134 --> 00:24:02,200
Jody, he's right.

412
00:24:02,202 --> 00:24:04,569
A-at best,
her loyalties are...

413
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:05,870
Screwed.

414
00:24:05,872 --> 00:24:07,672
And how do you even know
she wants to be saved?

415
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:09,040
For the past eight years,

416
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:11,376
she has been baiting the hook
for an entire nest.

417
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:13,111
She's got more blood
on her hands

418
00:24:13,113 --> 00:24:14,379
than most monsters we kill.

419
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:16,848
Are you saying
she's on your list?

420
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,882
No, we're not saying that.

421
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:18,917
Well, not yet.

422
00:24:21,954 --> 00:24:23,888
Look, it sucks, okay?
It does.

423
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,825
But with hunting monsters
comes harsh truths.

424
00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:28,360
This is a clean-up mission.

425
00:24:28,362 --> 00:24:29,327
It's not a rescue.

426
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:31,329
What is this
even really about?

427
00:24:31,331 --> 00:24:32,897
You barely know the girl.

428
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,967
I'm coming.

429
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:39,671
And if either one of you lays
so much as a hand on Alex...

430
00:24:39,673 --> 00:24:42,507
You'll have to go through me.

431
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:52,917
Put up quite a struggle
with Connor.

432
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,354
Says you nearly
took his eye out.

433
00:24:56,356 --> 00:25:00,592
Maybe that was just his excuse
for knocking you out.

434
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:05,730
You have any idea
the mess you made?

435
00:25:05,732 --> 00:25:09,701
Hunters raided the place
while we were out,

436
00:25:09,703 --> 00:25:12,137
tortured and killed Dale.

437
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:15,707
Our home's been made.

438
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:18,910
We're gonna have
to move again.

439
00:25:18,912 --> 00:25:20,345
Mama, I-I never meant --

440
00:25:20,347 --> 00:25:23,214
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh!

441
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:28,186
We will all find our way.

442
00:25:28,188 --> 00:25:30,722
Things got screwy...

443
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:35,727
...but you're back now.

444
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:37,462
Why?

445
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,464
After everything,
I thought that you --

446
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:40,331
You thought what?

447
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:44,536
That I'd hurt you?
Kill you?

448
00:25:50,943 --> 00:25:54,045
I would never hurt you.

449
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:58,349
Not my baby girl,
not my sweet Alex.

450
00:25:58,351 --> 00:26:01,219
How could you even
think that?

451
00:26:02,955 --> 00:26:07,926
Baby, why did you do it?
Why did you run from us?

452
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:11,029
I love you, mama.

453
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:13,465
I do. I just --

454
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:17,068
I couldn't
take it anymore.

455
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,305
The blood and the death,

456
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:22,373
the sounds of their screams.

457
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:26,177
I just...
I can't do it anymore.

458
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:29,547
And the way
I feel afterwards,

459
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:31,883
the guilt...

460
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:37,455
I'd rather die
than feel that way again.

461
00:26:43,295 --> 00:26:45,964
It's my fault.

462
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:47,065
What?

463
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:50,468
All of it.
This is my fault.

464
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,571
I should've turned you
years ago.

465
00:27:02,114 --> 00:27:05,550
Well, their truck's
in the driveway.

466
00:27:05,552 --> 00:27:07,619
So we're walking
right into it.

467
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:09,687
Well,
we've faced worse odds.

468
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:12,090
Yeah.
Jody.

469
00:27:12,092 --> 00:27:13,625
This is a raid,

470
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:16,661
so tread lightly,
stay close.

471
00:27:16,663 --> 00:27:18,930
Priority is
clearing the nest.

472
00:27:18,932 --> 00:27:20,431
Alex comes second.
You got it?

473
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:24,235
Got it.

474
00:27:29,842 --> 00:27:31,242
It was so selfish.

475
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:33,778
I wanted to
watch you grow up.

476
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,681
I kept putting it off.
Don't you see?

477
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:39,484
These things
you've been feeling --

478
00:27:39,486 --> 00:27:43,821
all the guilt and suffering --
those are human feelings.

479
00:27:45,157 --> 00:27:49,027
It ain't too late.
I can take the pain away.

480
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:55,199
And then
we can stay together,

481
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:57,302
as a family.

482
00:27:57,304 --> 00:28:00,338
Like none of this
ever happened.

483
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:05,243
Wouldn't you like that?

484
00:30:05,664 --> 00:30:07,131
Drop it.

485
00:30:26,985 --> 00:30:28,820
Alex, come on.
Come on, honey. We got to go.

486
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:29,654
Go away!

487
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:31,823
We got to go!

488
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:34,358
What did they do to you?

489
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,060
I'm sorry, Jody.

490
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:39,097
I made my choice.

491
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:45,136
She chose me.

492
00:30:54,175 --> 00:30:57,377
No, no, no.
No. Unh-unh-unh-unh.

493
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,581
Hell of a sight
to come home to...

494
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,250
Brother lying dead
on the floor.

495
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,989
No idea it was a Winchester
that had done it.

496
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:14,493
So...Which one of you
was it?

497
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:18,664
Which one of you took off
my brother's head?!

498
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:21,367
Was it you?

499
00:31:22,703 --> 00:31:24,103
Was it him?

500
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,047
Pretty fitting --

501
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:37,316
brother for a brother.

502
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:43,222
This place has been
a good home to us.

503
00:31:43,224 --> 00:31:46,659
But since you two had
to come around and ruin it,

504
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:49,295
we're gonna have to to hit
the road and find a new one.

505
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:56,269
And when we hit the road...

506
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:01,707
...we like to pack a lunch.

507
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:11,417
Can't say you
didn't come prepared.

508
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:13,519
Alex.

509
00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:15,388
Hey. Don't be
bothering my girl.

510
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,757
She's going through something,
a process.

511
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,593
What did you do to her?

512
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:22,795
Fed her my blood.

513
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:24,964
She's on her way now.

514
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:27,767
All that's left is to feed.

515
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:34,941
Please, mama.

516
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:38,277
Let her go.

517
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,915
I already drank from you.

518
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,450
Let her go.

519
00:32:44,452 --> 00:32:48,988
Made an impression on my girl,
I see.

520
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,023
Baby, this is the human
half of you talking.

521
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:53,426
After the change, this human --
she ain't nothing to you.

522
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:55,861
Clearly, Sheriff,
you got issues,

523
00:32:55,863 --> 00:32:59,298
some hole in your life
you're using my Alex to fill.

524
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,135
I <i>would</i> say go and get a family
of your own,

525
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:06,472
but, well...you know.

526
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:07,773
Wow. That's pretty rich

527
00:33:07,775 --> 00:33:10,609
coming from the woman
who stole Alex to begin with.

528
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:12,011
I have fed her,

529
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:17,249
clothed her, loved her
going on nine years.

530
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:19,018
You think motherhood's
just about blood?

531
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,853
You don't know the first thing
about it.

532
00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:23,622
Maybe not,
but I know what it isn't.

533
00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:26,692
And it ain't about forcing her
to be like you

534
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:29,395
the second she becomes
inconvenient.

535
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:34,867
Don't you see
what she is trying to do?

536
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:36,268
This hunter cop bitch

537
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,537
is trying
to turn you against me

538
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:40,406
to save her own hide.

539
00:33:40,408 --> 00:33:43,509
Don't believe a word
she says.

540
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:46,412
Ha!
Ow!

541
00:33:46,414 --> 00:33:48,714
She ain't your mother.

542
00:34:04,464 --> 00:34:07,666
Tapped this keg.
Get the short-hair one ready.

543
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,728
Time to finish this.

544
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,862
Alex!

545
00:34:37,864 --> 00:34:40,766
Was that her name?

546
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,469
You named her
after someone.

547
00:34:46,306 --> 00:34:47,973
Was it your daughter?

548
00:34:51,545 --> 00:34:54,113
I couldn't figure out
why you changed her name.

549
00:34:54,115 --> 00:34:56,715
I thought maybe you were ashamed
of your theft,

550
00:34:56,717 --> 00:34:57,950
but you have no shame.

551
00:34:57,952 --> 00:35:00,920
You said that I was using her
to fill a hole in my life,

552
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:03,856
and you're right.
I am.

553
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:06,225
You are, too.

554
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:10,129
Mama?

555
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:12,998
I guess it takes one
to know one.

556
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,001
That Alex...

557
00:35:16,003 --> 00:35:20,973
She died a <i>long</i> time ago.

558
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:23,409
And it still hurts.

559
00:35:24,978 --> 00:35:29,748
You still feel it, the loss,
the pain --

560
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,785
like a stone in your gut.

561
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:36,222
It hurts just a little bit less
whenever she's near.

562
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:44,230
You bitch.

563
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,960
Look at me.

564
00:36:17,164 --> 00:36:19,064
Look at me, bitch!

565
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:38,717
Dean.

566
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,718
Yeah, I know.

567
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,620
You wouldn't have done
the same for me.

568
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:43,689
No. Jody.

569
00:36:48,528 --> 00:36:51,197
Good news, lady cop.

570
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:56,402
Whoever <i>you</i> lost...

571
00:36:56,404 --> 00:37:01,040
You're gonna see them again
real soon.

572
00:37:12,586 --> 00:37:14,853
Alex?

573
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:25,731
How could you?

574
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:31,971
You were my girl.

575
00:37:34,074 --> 00:37:37,176
I'm sorry, mama.

576
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,985
Don't watch this, sweetheart.

577
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,922
Nice work back there.

578
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:16,578
"Look at me, bitch"?

579
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,481
Well, hey, you got another
snappy one-liner, I'm all ears.

580
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:20,515
What I'm saying is --

581
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:24,886
it looked to me like
you were enjoying it.

582
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,589
Maybe too much.

583
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:28,690
And?

584
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:32,094
Well, sorry for not putting on
a hair shirt.

585
00:38:32,096 --> 00:38:37,065
Killing things that need killing
is kind of our job.

586
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,770
Last I checked, taking pleasure
in that is not a crime.

587
00:38:41,772 --> 00:38:44,306
Right, but...

588
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:47,242
How's things
back at the station?

589
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:49,644
Well,
they beat Frank up pretty bad,

590
00:38:49,646 --> 00:38:51,546
but at least
they left him alive.

591
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:54,449
He kept apologizing for spilling
the beans about the cabin,

592
00:38:54,451 --> 00:38:56,284
but I told him
that one's on me.

593
00:38:56,286 --> 00:39:01,623
Well, speaking of apologies,
um...We owe you a big one.

594
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:04,192
We were wrong
about the girl.

595
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:08,897
No. You were right --
about me.

596
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:12,334
My judgment was clouded.

597
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:14,102
You know, working this case,

598
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:17,606
it brought...feelings back.

599
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:20,909
Feelings I've been trying
to bury for years,

600
00:39:20,911 --> 00:39:23,778
you know,
buried it under work,

601
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,615
religion...even dating.

602
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:28,016
We know how <i>that</i> worked out.

603
00:39:28,018 --> 00:39:33,421
But, you know, it was still
there, you know, underneath.

604
00:39:33,423 --> 00:39:35,891
The grief.

605
00:39:38,194 --> 00:39:40,228
Don't know what that means
for me,

606
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,596
just that I've been --

607
00:39:41,598 --> 00:39:44,599
I've been fooling myself to
think that I could ignore it.

608
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:48,570
Anyway, thank you --

609
00:39:48,572 --> 00:39:51,606
for coming out,
for curing Alex.

610
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:53,074
You don't need to thank us.

611
00:39:53,076 --> 00:39:55,644
I mean, you're the one
who killed her sire,

612
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:57,279
got her blood.

613
00:39:57,281 --> 00:40:00,315
Sure it'll work?

614
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:03,785
Well,
speaking from experience,

615
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:07,522
it'll be a rough
couple of days, but...

616
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:08,456
She should pull through.

617
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,125
You sure
you don't want us to stay?

618
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:13,261
I'm good.

619
00:40:13,263 --> 00:40:15,730
After it's done,

620
00:40:15,732 --> 00:40:17,832
you know what to do
with her?

621
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:34,482
Don't get up
on account of me.

622
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:36,451
I'm -- I'm hot.

623
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:39,187
Should I grab a --

624
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:41,122
I'll just be cold again
in a second.

625
00:40:41,124 --> 00:40:43,992
It's part of the cure,
I guess.

626
00:40:43,994 --> 00:40:45,193
You want something to eat?

627
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:47,796
No, I'll just throw it up.

628
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:49,965
But, uh, thank you.

629
00:40:53,302 --> 00:40:56,838
I want you to know that...

630
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,376
When mama offered,
I just...

631
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:05,480
I couldn't
disappoint her again.

632
00:41:12,188 --> 00:41:15,390
I had enough to be ashamed of
as it is.

633
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:20,795
Jody, I-I've done things.

634
00:41:20,797 --> 00:41:24,599
You don't have to explain.
I know.

635
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:28,737
Whatever you want from me,
I'll give it.

636
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,806
If you want, I'm here.

637
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:39,214
But what you've been through
the last 48 alone,

638
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:41,249
losing your entire family,

639
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:44,552
everything you've ever known
or loved --

640
00:41:44,554 --> 00:41:47,622
no one can understand that.

641
00:41:49,992 --> 00:41:53,595
<i>You</i> can.
