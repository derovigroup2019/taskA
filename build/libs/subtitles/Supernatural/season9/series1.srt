1
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:05,814
There is pretty much
nothing the Winchesters can't do

2
00:00:05,816 --> 00:00:07,415
if they work together.

3
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:14,890
I figured out
how to close the Gates of Hell.

4
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,858
? I walk 47 miles
of barbed wire ?

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,561
? I got a cobra snake
for a necktie ?

6
00:00:19,563 --> 00:00:21,496
? a brand-new house
on the roadside ?

7
00:00:21,498 --> 00:00:23,465
? and it's a-made
out of rattlesnake hide ?

8
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:25,700
? got a brand-new chimney
put on top ?

9
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:28,336
? and it's a-made
out of human skull ?

10
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:30,572
? come on, take a little walk
with me, baby ?

11
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:32,641
? and tell me,
who do you love? ?

12
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:34,476
Heaven needs your help,
Castiel.

13
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:37,479
? Who do you love?

14
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:39,447
Hello, Castiel.

15
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:41,416
? Around the town I use
a rattlesnake whip ?

16
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:43,919
? take it easy, baby,
don't you give me no lip ?

17
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:45,954
? who do you love?

18
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:50,992
? Who do you love?

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,065
? I've got a tombstone hand
and a graveyard mind ?

20
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,100
? I'm just 22,
and I don't mind dying ?

21
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,303
? who do you love?

22
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:03,405
I deserve to be loved!

23
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:08,443
? Yeah, who do you love?

24
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:10,712
? Who do you love?

25
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:16,418
Sammy, stop!

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,320
Just let it go.

27
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:19,888
Sam?

28
00:01:28,197 --> 00:01:29,698
What's happening?

29
00:01:30,617 --> 00:01:31,951
Angels.

30
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,257
They're falling.

31
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,547
This makes no sense.

32
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,500
I mean, how many angels fell --
hundreds, thousands?

33
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:49,385
And nobody sees anything.

34
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:50,386
This is...

35
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:51,938
Look at this.

36
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,890
They're calling it
a meteor shower.

37
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:55,725
Seriously?

38
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:59,178
What's going on, man?
You okay?

39
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,447
Me?

40
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:03,032
Yes.
I'm fine. It's just --

41
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:05,701
it's just we got a major
freakin' crap fest on our hands.

42
00:02:05,703 --> 00:02:07,036
Yeah,
tell me about it.

43
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:09,238
Thousands of superpowered dicks
touching down,

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,357
and we got no idea
where to start.

45
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,827
Angels aren't our problem
right now, okay?

46
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,028
Or demons or Metatron

47
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,214
- or whatever the hell happened to Cass.
- Why?

48
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:20,166
Because we hugged it out
in that church

49
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:22,535
and -- and now we're gonna go
to Disneyland?

50
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:23,869
Dean,
you said it yourself --

51
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:25,755
we're not gonna sleep
till this is done.

52
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:27,640
I know.

53
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:29,875
So,
what's the problem?

54
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:32,311
You.

55
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:36,065
Look, there's no easy way
to say this, okay?

56
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:38,818
But something happened
back there in the church.

57
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,822
And I don't know what.
I don't know why.

58
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:45,024
You're dying, Sam.

59
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:49,695
Shut up.

60
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:17,972

62
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,317
The MRI shows
massive internal burns

63
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,402
affecting
many of the major organs.

64
00:03:29,404 --> 00:03:33,189
Oxygen to the brain
has been severely deprived.

65
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,807
The coma is the result

66
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:38,161
of the body doing everything
in its limited power

67
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:40,446
to protect itself
from further harm.

68
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:44,434
This wasn't
supposed to happen.

69
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:49,422
If your brother continues
on this trajectory,

70
00:03:49,424 --> 00:03:51,841
the machines
might keep him alive, but --

71
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:53,159
He'll be dead.

72
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:55,178
Technically, yes.

73
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,263
I'm afraid so.

74
00:03:57,265 --> 00:04:01,267
So, there's --
there's no recovery?

75
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:02,685
I mean,
there's no bounce-back.

76
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:03,686
There's no nothing.

77
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,688
I'm afraid
that's in God's hands now.

78
00:04:07,992 --> 00:04:09,309
You're a doctor.

79
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:12,111
You're
a medical professional.

80
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:13,196
You're trying to tell me

81
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:15,231
that my brother's life
is in God's hands?

82
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:16,983
What, is that supposed to be
a-a comfort?

83
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:18,184
Mr. Dougherty --

84
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:21,120
no, God has nothing to do
with this equation at all.

85
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:22,956
I didn't mean --
that's not good enough.

86
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:50,500
Cass, are you there?

87
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:57,240
Sammy's hurt.

88
00:04:57,242 --> 00:05:00,526
He's hurt, uh --
he's hurt pretty bad.

89
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:06,666
And, um...

90
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:10,286
I know you think
that I'm pissed at you, okay?

91
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:14,540
But I don't care
that the angels fell.

92
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:18,878
So whatever you did
or didn't do,

93
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,382
it doesn't matter, okay?

94
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:24,183
We'll work it out.

95
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,288
Please, man, I need you here.

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,455
Screw it.

97
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:50,159
Okay, listen up.

98
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:55,214
This one goes out to any angel
with their ears on.

99
00:05:55,216 --> 00:06:00,720
This is Dean Winchester...
And I need your help.

100
00:06:00,722 --> 00:06:05,925
<i>This is Dean Winchester...</i>
<i>And I need your help.</i>

101
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:07,510
<i>The deal is this --</i>

102
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:11,630
<i>Linwood Memorial Hospital,</i>
<i>Randolph, New York.</i>

103
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:14,133
<i>The first one who can help me</i>
<i>gets my help in return,</i>

104
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:15,985
<i>and you know</i>
<i>that ain't nothin'.</i>

105
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:17,403
Honey.

106
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:21,807
<i>Hell, it's no secret that we</i>
<i>haven't always seen eye to eye.</i>

107
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:26,279
<i>But you know</i>
<i>that I am good for my word,</i>

108
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:28,948
<i>and, uh,</i>

109
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,920
<i>I wouldn't be asking</i>
<i>if I wasn't needing, so...</i>

110
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:41,744
Look, just because you're dying

111
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:42,864
doesn't mean you're
dead -- not yet, okay?

112
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:44,547
We've jimmied ourselves
out of worse.

113
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:45,932
We're gonna fight this.

114
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:49,018
I got the plan. You just got to
hang on. You hear me?

115
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,670
Absolutely.

116
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:54,057
You think I'm lying?

117
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:55,608
Pretty much, yeah.

118
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,061
You understand that we're not
really in this car right now.

119
00:06:58,063 --> 00:07:02,698
We are in your head, and you're
in a coma and are dying.

120
00:07:08,155 --> 00:07:09,688
How do you know that?

121
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,690
Because I'm you
and you're you.

122
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:12,858
All of this is you.

123
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,859
We're in your head!

124
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:16,362
You're serious.

125
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:27,757
The whole reason I stopped doing
the trials was not to die.

126
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,426
And the next time we see Naomi
or Metatron

127
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:33,429
or whoever is to blame for this,
we will get some justice,

128
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:35,932
but for right now,
we got to fight this, man.

129
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:37,400
Okay.

130
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:38,551
All right, what's the plan?

131
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:39,685
I'm working on it.

132
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:41,654
What does that mean?

133
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:43,556
I'm kind of dying here,
apparently.

134
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:45,908
It means I'm working on it,
all right?

135
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:51,564
The thing is, if I am dying --
and I believe you. I do.

136
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:56,035
But if you're you
but you're really me

137
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:59,238
and you're the part of me
that wants to fight to live...

138
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,423
Yes.

139
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:02,792
I have no idea what you
just said, but continue.

140
00:08:02,794 --> 00:08:10,049
But if you don't have any idea
how I'm supposed to fight,

141
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:12,468
then am I supposed to be
fighting at all?

142
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,054
Are you serious?

143
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:17,023
Hell, yes, he's serious.

144
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:21,194
And if you ask me, I think
the kid's got a good point.

145
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:52,091
Hey, buddy.

146
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:54,093
You okay?

147
00:08:57,565 --> 00:09:00,149
It hurts.

148
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,134
What the hell you doing in the
middle of the road like that?

149
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:06,489
I heard angels.

150
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:11,194
How about
we get you some water, hmm?

151
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:15,615
I, uh,
I don't drink water.

152
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:18,000
Dehydration's a real bitch
up here, mister.

153
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:20,336
A phone.
Do you have a phone?

154
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:22,821
No signal up here.

155
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:28,127
How about a lift, hmm?

156
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:31,681
Yes. Good.

157
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:36,636
I would fly, but I --
I have no wings, not anymore.

158
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:39,838
Right.

159
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:43,025
Sam wants to die,
and you think he's got a point?!

160
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:44,393
Okay,
I don't want to die.

161
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:46,180
I asked if maybe
I was supposed to die.

162
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:46,976
Shut it, Sam.

163
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,147
You -- go.

164
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:49,482
Oh, and, uh, before you throw me
under the bus,

165
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:51,183
you're welcome
for the hell rescue.

166
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:55,020
Hey, first of all, you didn't
rescue Jack, half-wit. Sam did.

167
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:57,690
Second of all, Sam,
you're in a coma.

168
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:59,659
Now, suck as that may,

169
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:01,694
sometimes that's just the way
things go.

170
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:03,162
What are you talking about?
There's always a way.

171
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:04,213
You taught us that.

172
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:05,965
Oh, you mean like the way
one of you idjits

173
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:08,367
does some "bass-ackwards"
crazy thing to beat death,

174
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:09,502
like sell your soul?

175
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:11,036
Exactly like
selling my soul.

176
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:12,888
Yeah, like that worked so well
the last time.

177
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,374
Enough! Both of you!
I can't hear myself think!

178
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:20,846
Well, you're not actually
buying this, are you?

179
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:22,715
Excuse me.
Are you dead?

180
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:25,384
Because I am, and maybe I'm here
because I'm the part of Sam

181
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:27,770
that actually knows what
the hell he's talking about.

182
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:30,106
I'm in the front seat
because Sam put me here

183
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:31,440
because he wants to fight.

184
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,075
Right?

185
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:35,861
Well...

186
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:37,396
that just got
real uncomfortable.

187
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:38,664
See ya, Dean.

188
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,032
Sam, don't you dare --

189
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:45,087
Yip, yip, yip.
Am I right?

190
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:50,092
Honestly, Bobby, I --

191
00:10:50,094 --> 00:10:52,628
I don't know
what's right.

192
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:56,415
Honestly, Bobby, let's walk.

193
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:15,451
Hey.

194
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:22,941
No,
I can't take your money.

195
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,377
For the phone.

196
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:25,578
And a sandwich
if they have one.

197
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,962
It's okay. I don't eat.

198
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:28,280
You'll figure something.

199
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:31,450
Hmm?

200
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:34,470
Take care, kid.

201
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:57,693
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

202
00:11:57,695 --> 00:11:58,811
Hang up the phone.

203
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:00,646
Right.

204
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:03,532
Excuse me.

205
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:04,984
This is an emergency.

206
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:06,285
I don't want to hurt you.

207
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:09,288
Hold on, hon.

208
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,957
Sure you do. Hurt me.

209
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,211
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:26,055
I'm gonna finish
this call.

211
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:28,591
Then I'm gonna stab you.

212
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:33,596
I know you.
I don't think so.

213
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:36,098
Castiel.

214
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,200
We met in heaven.

215
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:39,902
My name is Hael.

216
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:41,904
You're an angel.

217
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:44,657
Am I?

218
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:48,911
What's an angel
without its wings?

219
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,034
Hi.

220
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:57,069
I'm just gonna break the ice.
Are you an angel?

221
00:12:58,706 --> 00:13:00,139
Sometimes I wish I were.

222
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:02,007
My name is Kim Schortz,

223
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:04,760
and I'm a grief counselor
here at the hospital.

224
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:07,012
Right. Uh, uh...

225
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:08,347
Sorry.
I'm just tired.

226
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:11,600
Well, all due respect,
but, uh,

227
00:13:11,602 --> 00:13:14,603
I'm not grieving --
not yet at least, so --

228
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:17,189
I'm afraid,
as hard as this may be,

229
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:19,107
this might be
a good time to talk...

230
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:21,393
About the inevitable.

231
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:25,147
Look, I'm sure you're
a nice person

232
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,866
and that you mean well,
but "inevitable" --

233
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:30,168
that's a fightin' word
where I come from.

234
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,738
There's always a way.

235
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,740
And I am a prayerful woman

236
00:13:34,742 --> 00:13:38,210
who believes in miracles
as much as the next,

237
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:40,111
but I also know
how to read an E.E.G.

238
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:43,265
And unless you're telling me
you have a direct line

239
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,334
to those angels
that you were looking for --

240
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:47,719
Yeah, no, I, uh...

241
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:50,288
Guess I don't.

242
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:54,959
But I might have something
better.

243
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,398
I got
the king of Hell in my trunk.

244
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,233
Uh, is -- is that...

245
00:14:01,235 --> 00:14:02,267
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,819
Is that a metaphor?

247
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:12,828
Crowley, listen up,
you son of a bitch.

248
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,780
One for yes, two for no.

249
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:16,698
You alive?

250
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:20,035
Come on,
don't be a pouter.

251
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:22,037
There we go.

252
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:24,989
You prayed?

253
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:26,324
Yeah, for help.

254
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:28,343
Yes.
You'll be helping me.

255
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:38,056
If you lie to me,
Dean Winchester,

256
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:40,692
I will rip
your throat out.

257
00:14:40,694 --> 00:14:41,860
Where is Castiel?

258
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:42,978
Who's asking?

259
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,113
Try every angel
who was ejected from their home.

260
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:47,949
Oh. Oh, well, in that case,
I have no clue.

261
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:53,705
Easy there, brother.

262
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:56,124
This young man has prayed
for our assistance.

263
00:14:56,126 --> 00:15:00,211
Are we creatures of wrath
or compassion?

264
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:01,329
I would argue the latter.

265
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,548
Forgive me, brother.

266
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,600
I don't recognize you.

267
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,619
Happy to make
your re-acquaintance.

268
00:15:07,621 --> 00:15:09,137
After you disarm.

269
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:20,682
Come, now.

270
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:23,634
Is that any way to treat
a brother injured in the fall?

271
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:43,922
Who are you?

272
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:45,590
Never mind me.

273
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:47,625
You're Dean Winchester.

274
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:52,013
I heard your prayer,
and I am here to help.

275
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,670
Okay.

276
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:04,693
It was a normal day,
and then just...

277
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:06,795
Dark.

278
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:10,398
And then
I was just...falling.

279
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,302
How could that happen?

280
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:18,323
I don't know.

281
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:23,211
Your grace --
it's...gone?

282
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:27,215
I do still hear angel radio,
though.

283
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:32,754
Then you've heard them --
our brothers and sisters,

284
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:38,810
many still circling for vessels,
most just...so afraid.

285
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:41,896
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

286
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:43,932
I can assure you.

287
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:46,634
But Heaven --
there was order.

288
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:49,871
There was purpose.

289
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:53,108
Well,
believe it or not,

290
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,310
there may be something
even better down here.

291
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:57,228
I don't understand.

292
00:16:59,348 --> 00:17:03,518
There's opportunity for you,
the others who have fallen,

293
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,006
to do finally do
what you would like to do --

294
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:09,758
not just
what you've been told.

295
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,180
And what would I
like to do?

296
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:17,515
You tell me.

297
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:21,919
If you could do anything,
what would it be?

298
00:17:27,476 --> 00:17:30,411
There's a place.

299
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:33,264
I built it
when I was last here --

300
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:36,201
many years ago.

301
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:39,287
A Grand Canyon.

302
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,125
The Grand Canyon, yes.

303
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:47,295
I-I would like to see that.

304
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:51,299
Let's go see the Grand Canyon,
then.

305
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:01,810
You want to help?

306
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:04,846
Start with a name.

307
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:09,517
Ezekiel.

308
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,320
All right, Ezekiel.

309
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:14,189
How do I know
you're not hunting me or Castiel

310
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,690
like the other angels?

311
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:18,809
Oh, I'm sure there are
many angels who are.

312
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:22,113
Many more are on their way here,
most likely.

313
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:24,982
How do you know that?

314
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:26,868
You put out an open prayer
like that...

315
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,487
I must
really be desperate.

316
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:40,431
Believe it or not, some of us
still do believe in our mission.

317
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:44,168
And that means we believe
in Castiel...and you.

318
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:48,223
You said you were hurt
during the fall.

319
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:49,474
I was.

320
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:53,695
Entangling with my brother
back there did me no favors.

321
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:58,700
But what strength I have left,
I offer to you.

322
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:03,071
I want to fight. I do.

323
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:04,355
But I just feel like...

324
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:06,541
Like you got nothing
to swing at?

325
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:08,192
Like you're punching
at shadows?

326
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:12,297
You got to let go of fightin'
and scratchin'

327
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,667
and lookin' for loopholes,
'cause that ain't happenin'.

328
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:18,035
So -- so, what?
I-I-I just die?

329
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:19,754
"Just die"?

330
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:22,390
All the good you've done,
all the people you've saved,

331
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:24,893
all the sacrifices
you've made?

332
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,844
You've saved the world,
son.

333
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:29,714
How many people
can say that?

334
00:19:29,716 --> 00:19:30,899
How many people can say

335
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:33,301
that they have left
this godforsaken hunk of dirt

336
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:35,069
that much a better place?

337
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:39,941
What you call dyin'
I call leavin' a legacy.

338
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:53,221
You still able to cure things
after the fall?

339
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:55,290
Yes, I should be,
but...

340
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:57,592
He's so weak.

341
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:06,084
Who is this?

342
00:20:06,086 --> 00:20:07,585
Dean.

343
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:13,775
Cass,
what the hell's going on?

344
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:15,226
Metatron tricked me.

345
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:17,061
It wasn't angel trials.
It was a spell.

346
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:18,279
I wanted you to know that.

347
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:20,648
Okay. That's great, but we've
got ourselves a problem.

348
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,150
What's wrong?

349
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:23,434
Sam.

350
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:26,604
He's, um --
they say he's dying.

351
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:27,836
What happened?

352
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,458
I don't know. I mean, first
he was okay, and then he wasn't.

353
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:30,842
And I --
have you heard my prayers?

354
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:32,794
I've been praying to you
all night.

355
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,278
Dean,
Metatron -- he --

356
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
he took my Grace.

357
00:20:36,282 --> 00:20:37,749
What?
Don't worry about me.

358
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:38,949
What are you doing
for Sam?

359
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:40,335
Uh, everything I can.

360
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,387
There's actually another angel in there
working on him right now.

361
00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:43,671
What other angel?

362
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:46,758
Um, his name is Ezekiel. He's
cool. I mean, I think he is.

363
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,810
Ezekiel. Yes.

364
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:50,762
He's a good soldier.

365
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:53,431
He should be able to help
until I get there.

366
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:55,132
Wait, no, no, no.
No, hey, that's not an option.

367
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:56,684
It might be a few days,
but --

368
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:57,986
Hey, Cass, listen to me.

369
00:20:57,988 --> 00:20:59,937
There are angels out there,
okay?

370
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:02,573
And they -- they're looking
for you, and they're pissed.

371
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,659
Not all of them, Dean.

372
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:07,195
Some are just looking
for direction.

373
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:09,163
Some are just lost.

374
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:10,498
What are you talking about?

375
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,532
I met one.

376
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:13,284
I think I can help her,
Dean.

377
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:15,086
No, Cass,
I know you want to help, okay?

378
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:16,170
I do, but helping angels

379
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:18,039
is what got you in trouble
in the first place.

380
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,792
Now, I'm begging you --
for once, look out for yourself.

381
00:21:20,794 --> 00:21:23,661
Until we figure out what the
hell is going on, trust nobody.

382
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:25,930
And do what?
Just abandon them all?

383
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:28,132
Damn it, Cass.
You hearing yourself?

384
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:30,184
There's a war on,
and it's on you.

385
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:32,136
There's thousands of them
out th--

386
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:34,138
you said you lost your Grace,
right?

387
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,339
That means you're human.

388
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:37,174
That means you bleed
and you eat and you sleep

389
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:39,227
and all the things you
never had to worry about before.

390
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:40,845
I'm fine, Dean.

391
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:45,316
Whoa.

392
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:46,234
What's going on?

393
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:48,069
I think
we got more company.

394
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:50,405
Look, get your ass
to the bunker alone.

395
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:51,656
You hear me?
Dean.

396
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,691
Go, Cass!
Dean.

397
00:21:55,911 --> 00:21:57,295
One of yours?

398
00:21:57,297 --> 00:22:00,381
Trying to secure a vessel.
We need to move.

399
00:22:00,383 --> 00:22:02,533
No, no.
If we move him, he dies.

400
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:04,535
If we stay,
we could all die.

401
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:17,648
I don't understand.

402
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,100
I'll come with you.

403
00:22:19,102 --> 00:22:20,601
We can see your friend
together.

404
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:22,236
It's complicated.

405
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:23,521
There could be trouble.

406
00:22:23,523 --> 00:22:25,189
It's -- it's best
if I go alone.

407
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:29,059
My -- my friend --
he...needs my help.

408
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:30,361
<i>I</i> need help.

409
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:35,366
You can do this, Hael.

410
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:40,338
This is your chance
to help people,

411
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,707
to help yourself.

412
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:47,095
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:05,044
Long as these are up,
no angels are coming in.

414
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:07,647
No one's coming out.
You gonna be okay with these?

415
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:09,599
I'll manage.

416
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:13,737
What?

417
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:14,821
They're here.

418
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:20,360
Okay.

419
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:22,228
Do not open this door
for anybody but me.

420
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,081
Save him,
you hear me?

421
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:40,013
Everybody out! Now!

422
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:42,048
Get out!

423
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:05,956
You understand that I couldn't
just let you leave.

424
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:09,108
I'd be lost without you,
Castiel.

425
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:14,998
Yes,
I'm...beginning to see that.

426
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,668
It's the least I could ask
of you, considering, well...

427
00:24:20,972 --> 00:24:24,474
...this <i>is</i> all your fault,
isn't it?

428
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:28,478
Making the angels fall?

429
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,818
So, we'll drive
to the Grand Canyon,

430
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,737
you'll tell me more
about humans,

431
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:39,322
and I'll show you
what I'm capable of.

432
00:24:39,324 --> 00:24:43,610
We're going to become
more than just friends, Castiel.

433
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:46,580
We're going to become one.

434
00:24:46,582 --> 00:24:49,315
You want to possess me.

435
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:52,485
Your vessel is strong.

436
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:56,089
This one won't hold me
much longer.

437
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:03,213
You were right, Castiel.

438
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:08,685
With us together, I think
I could learn to like it here.

439
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,056
Hey.
You got to get out of here.

440
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:16,026
Come on. Come on.

441
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:17,861
Whoa.

442
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:19,896
Stay behind me.

443
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:26,352
Or not.

444
00:25:29,824 --> 00:25:31,992
There it is.

445
00:25:31,994 --> 00:25:35,228
Everything inside you need
to help you on your way.

446
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,381
Go on, son.

447
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:42,218
I'll be waiting for you
with a couple of cold ones.

448
00:25:51,178 --> 00:25:52,762
Sorry, old man.

449
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:55,214
Dean, are you insane?!

450
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:57,050
Come on, Sammy.

451
00:25:57,052 --> 00:25:58,985
Bobby was the part of you
that wants to die.

452
00:25:58,987 --> 00:26:01,321
I know it stings,
but he had to go.

453
00:26:01,323 --> 00:26:03,023
No. <i>You</i> have to go.

454
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:06,526
When are you gonna realize
it's over?!

455
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:08,028
There's nothing to fight for!

456
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,996
No, see, I know
you don't believe that.

457
00:26:09,998 --> 00:26:11,915
Really?

458
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:15,585
Then what's your plan,
Dean?

459
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:19,255
My plan?

460
00:26:20,258 --> 00:26:22,676
My plan is to fight!

461
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:25,345
My plan is to try!

462
00:26:25,347 --> 00:26:27,580
My plan is to give a damn!

463
00:26:27,582 --> 00:26:29,799
Are you telling me
there's nothing? Huh?

464
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,217
You telling me
there's nothing to fight for,

465
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:32,418
that there's
nothing to hope for?!

466
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,855
No.
I'm telling you there is.

467
00:26:35,857 --> 00:26:38,224
You might not like it.

468
00:26:38,226 --> 00:26:40,894
You might not accept it,
but it's in there.

469
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:42,062
It's in that house.

470
00:26:42,064 --> 00:26:43,697
You know
what's in that house!

471
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:45,315
Now, I can't help you

472
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:48,935
if you ain't willing
to fight for yourself!

473
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:54,574
I know.

474
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,444
It's okay.

475
00:26:58,446 --> 00:27:01,081
It's what I want.

476
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:27,306
Let me make this easy --
tell me where Castiel is,

477
00:27:27,308 --> 00:27:28,858
or your brother's
gonna wish he were dead.

478
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,144
Yeah, good luck
getting past the warding.

479
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:33,113
But we will.

480
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:38,334
And when we do, I'm gonna
strip off all his skin,

481
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:39,485
and you're gonna watch.

482
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:43,006
Bite me.

483
00:27:50,015 --> 00:27:53,833
Anybody ever tell you
you hit like an angel?

484
00:28:14,205 --> 00:28:16,656
Hello, Sam.

485
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:23,529
I've been waiting
for you.

486
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,339
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

487
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:37,043
I'll tell you
where Cass is.

488
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:39,813
I just have one question.

489
00:28:39,815 --> 00:28:41,097
Ask.

490
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:43,650
If heaven is locked,

491
00:28:43,652 --> 00:28:47,220
then where do you go
when I do this?

492
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:49,155
Aah!

493
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,767
What the hell's happening?

494
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:02,535
This just started.

495
00:29:02,537 --> 00:29:04,070
And the warding.

496
00:29:04,072 --> 00:29:07,907
I'm afraid
I'm weaker than I thought.

497
00:29:09,293 --> 00:29:11,344
I am sorry, Dean.

498
00:29:11,346 --> 00:29:12,929
No. No, no, no.

499
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:14,597
No, we had a deal,
okay?

500
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,266
I fight. You save.

501
00:29:16,268 --> 00:29:17,634
And would that I could.

502
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:19,636
I'm just afraid
it's too late.

503
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:21,721
Are you kidding me?

504
00:29:21,723 --> 00:29:23,690
Are you saying there's no way
to save my brother's life?

505
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:25,942
No good ways, I'm afraid.

506
00:29:25,944 --> 00:29:28,278
Well,
what are the bad ones?

507
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,896
We're out of options here,
man.

508
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,531
Good or bad,
let me hear them.

509
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:32,982
I cannot promise,

510
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:37,654
but there is a chance I can fix
your brother from the inside.

511
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:39,906
From the inside.

512
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:42,158
So, what,
you gonna open him up?

513
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:45,945
What, possession?

514
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:47,380
You want to possess Sam?

515
00:29:47,382 --> 00:29:48,364
I told you.

516
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:50,083
No way.

517
00:29:50,085 --> 00:29:51,334
Understood.
It's your call.

518
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:52,936
No, it's Sam's call.

519
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:55,922
There's no way in hell
he'd say yes

520
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:57,456
to being possessed
by anything.

521
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,142
He would rather die.

522
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:13,189
I'll leave you two alone,
then.

523
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:21,264
Wait.

524
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,652
If I consider this --
and I mean just consider it --

525
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:42,238
I need something, man.

526
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,057
You got to prove to me
how bad he is.

527
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:57,402
Close your eyes.

528
00:30:57,404 --> 00:30:59,538
I must admit,
when I heard it was you,

529
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,791
well,
I had to come myself.

530
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,962
I bet you get off
on this.

531
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:08,430
Perhaps.

532
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:10,583
But not in the way
you assume.

533
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:12,935
I consider it
to be quite the honor

534
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:16,155
to be collecting the likes
of Sam Winchester.

535
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:20,693
I try so hard not to pass
judgment at times like this --

536
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:23,595
not my bag,
you see, but you...

537
00:31:25,865 --> 00:31:28,984
Well played, my boy.

538
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:38,661
I need to know one thing.

539
00:31:41,998 --> 00:31:43,315
Yes.

540
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:47,136
If I go with you...

541
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:56,161
...can you promise
that this time it will be final?

542
00:31:56,163 --> 00:32:00,816
That if I'm dead,
I stay dead.

543
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:05,804
Nobody can reverse it,
nobody can deal it away...

544
00:32:05,806 --> 00:32:09,191
And nobody else can get hurt
because of me.

545
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:13,612
I can promise that.

546
00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:17,950
What the hell you doing,
Sam?

547
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:19,301
As you can see,
there's not much time.

548
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:21,537
I know.

549
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,339
Damn it. I know.

550
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:52,618
How will it work?

551
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,155
Mutual benefit,
I suppose.

552
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:58,457
I heal Sam
while healing myself.

553
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:01,193
And when he's healed?

554
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:02,694
I leave.

555
00:33:04,831 --> 00:33:08,867
It's the best
of a bad situation, Dean.

556
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:17,760
Even if I said yes,
it doesn't mean squat.

557
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,763
Sam will never say yes --
not to you.

558
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,682
But he would say yes
to you.

559
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:11,313
I don't want to hurt you.

560
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,398
I didn't want to hurt
any of them.

561
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,483
I want to help you.

562
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,936
I will devote my life
to helping you all.

563
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:20,956
Do you know how ridiculous
you sound?

564
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:25,077
Help angels?
After what you did?

565
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:28,464
They don't want your help,
Castiel.

566
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,614
They want your head.

567
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:32,417
You're wrong.
I'm one of you.

568
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:34,619
I will never stop being
one of you.

569
00:34:34,621 --> 00:34:35,721
Don't you get it?

570
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:39,975
Together,
I can protect you, Castiel.

571
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,912
I don't need your --

572
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:47,349
I don't want
your protection.

573
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,268
If you leave me here
in this broken girl,

574
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,304
I swear it, Castiel --
I will tell them where you are.

575
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:54,490
And they will hunt you.

576
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,691
Until their last breath,

577
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,327
they will seek revenge
on the angel that did this,

578
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,912
who destroyed heaven.

579
00:34:59,914 --> 00:35:01,130
Stop.

580
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,282
They will seek a vengeance
on you

581
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:06,418
that will make God striking down
Lucifer seem like child's play.

582
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,536
Stop it.

583
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:10,289
I will go on angel radio
and tell them everything

584
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:13,342
unless you open your heart
and say yes.

585
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:24,937
It's time, Sam.
Shall we?

586
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:26,722
Hold on.

587
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:27,556
Dean.

588
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:28,957
It's okay, Sam.

589
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:32,060
I, uh,
would have brought cronuts,

590
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:34,112
but time is short,
so...

591
00:35:34,114 --> 00:35:35,831
By all means.

592
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:36,782
What's going on?

593
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:37,816
I found a plan.

594
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:39,985
It's too late.
I'm going.

595
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,036
No, no. No, no.
Listen to me.

596
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,020
Why are you even here?

597
00:35:42,022 --> 00:35:43,521
I'm not fighting this
anymore!

598
00:35:43,523 --> 00:35:45,857
You have to fight this!

599
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:48,994
I can fix this, okay?

600
00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:50,412
But not if you shut me out.

601
00:35:51,798 --> 00:35:53,999
It's not his time.

602
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,368
That's for Sam to decide.

603
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:01,723
Sam, listen to me.

604
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:05,427
I made you a promise
in that church.

605
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,846
You and me,
come whatever.

606
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:10,899
Well, hell,
if this ain't whatever...

607
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:13,435
But you got to let me in,
man.

608
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,153
You got to let me help.

609
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:17,272
There ain't no me
if there ain't no you.

610
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:28,367
What do I do?

611
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,036
Is that a yes?

612
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:36,291
Yes.

613
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:40,128
Come on.

614
00:36:59,046 --> 00:37:01,030
Who are you?

615
00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:02,441
What the hell
is going on here?

616
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:05,577
I have no idea.

617
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:10,231
So?

618
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:13,118
How's it look in there?

619
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,069
Not good.

620
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:16,705
There is much work
to be done.

621
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:19,758
Yeah, but he's gonna wake up,
right?

622
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,077
He will.

623
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,545
So, what he does -- what,

624
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:26,331
is he gonna feel you inside,
triaging his spleen?

625
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,933
He will not feel me,
no.

626
00:37:27,935 --> 00:37:31,687
There is no reason for Sam
to know I'm in here at all.

627
00:37:31,689 --> 00:37:34,973
You're joking.
No, this is -- this is too big.

628
00:37:34,975 --> 00:37:36,391
And what will he do

629
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:39,728
if you do tell him
he is possessed by an angel?

630
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,031
Well,
he'll have to understand.

631
00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:44,766
And if he does not?

632
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:50,973
Without his acceptance,
Sam can eject me at any time,

633
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:53,375
especially with me so weak.

634
00:37:53,377 --> 00:37:57,245
And if Sam does eject me,
he will die.

635
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:13,228
Then we keep it a secret
for now.

636
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,730
Or until Sam's well enough

637
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:17,182
that he doesn't need
an angelic pacemaker

638
00:38:17,184 --> 00:38:18,800
or I find a way to tell him.

639
00:38:18,802 --> 00:38:20,485
I-I...

640
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:21,853
As for him
being in a hospital,

641
00:38:21,855 --> 00:38:23,405
I'll have to
figure something out.

642
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:26,408
I can erase it all,
if you like.

643
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,977
He will not remember
any of this.

644
00:40:24,277 --> 00:40:26,445
Where are we?

645
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:30,115
Whoa! Sam?

646
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:31,650
What?

647
00:40:31,652 --> 00:40:33,819
Okay, take -- take it easy.
How you, uh -- how you feeling?

648
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:36,488
Tired.

649
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,623
Like I -- like I slept
for a week.

650
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,909
Well, try a day.

651
00:40:40,911 --> 00:40:43,295
You've been out since the sky
was spittin' angels.

652
00:40:43,297 --> 00:40:45,163
What the hell happened?

653
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:48,216
What do you remember?

654
00:40:48,218 --> 00:40:52,137
The church,
feeling like crap,

655
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:56,258
the angels falling,
and that's it.

656
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,343
But you're feeling good?

657
00:40:58,345 --> 00:41:02,130
Yeah.
I mean, I just, um...

658
00:41:02,132 --> 00:41:04,432
You've been driving around
with me passed out

659
00:41:04,434 --> 00:41:06,134
in the passenger's seat
for a day?

660
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:08,937
Oh, I mean, I stopped,
you know,

661
00:41:08,939 --> 00:41:10,438
let a few Japanese tourists
take some pictures.

662
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,823
Nobody got too handsy.

663
00:41:15,862 --> 00:41:18,479
I knew you'd pull through.

664
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:20,982
I meant what I said
at the church.

665
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:24,819
You're capable of anything,
Sam,

666
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:28,874
and hell
if you didn't prove me right.

667
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,961
Good.

668
00:41:34,765 --> 00:41:36,681
'Cause we got work to do.
