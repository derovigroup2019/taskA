1
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:16,160
? Sometimes I'm so high
that I just float ?

2
00:00:16,162 --> 00:00:19,230
This place
is beautiful.

3
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:21,766
Oh,
it's all right.

4
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:23,034
? I can't even think
about all the darkness ahead ?

5
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:24,402
You're beautiful.

6
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:26,871
Look, Ross, if you think
laying it on thick like that's

7
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:28,773
gonna get you somewhere
tonight...

8
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,808
I'm right?
...You're totally right.

9
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:35,146
Okay, spill --
why are we here?

10
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:39,083
? But my problem,
just the same ?

11
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:41,052
Hold that thought.

12
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:46,390
? As every man,
woman and child ?

13
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:50,027
? but every good thing must come
to an end, move on somehow ?

14
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,696
Mr. Ross,
I hear it's a big night.

15
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:55,666
Yeah.
The biggest.

16
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:58,169
Can you put this
in a glass of champagne?

17
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,670
Something nice?

18
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:01,338
How unique.

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,641
Sal!
Hey!

20
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:05,242
Long time no see.

21
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:06,644
Too long, Maurice.
How you been, man?

22
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:08,379
Good, how are you doing?
Good. Good to see you.

23
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:10,247
Dude --
man, we were just talking.

24
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:11,816
You got a problem?

25
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:13,050
Oh, chill out,
Marv.

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,388
It's all good,
yeah?

27
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,156
- Yeah.
- This way, gentlemen.

28
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:20,057
How you been?

29
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,792
Good, Mr. Lassiter.
Good.

30
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:25,496
? I can't even think
about all the darkness ahead ?

31
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:27,898
Sometimes you give,
and sometimes you get, huh?

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,533
And sometimes
you really get.

33
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,148
Hey, Mindy.

34
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,616
You miss me?

35
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:49,186
Aww. I liked you
as a blond.

36
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,784
Better? I hear
they have more fun.

37
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:27,024
Hello, Julian.

38
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:29,226
I'm not looking
for trouble.

39
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:30,694
I just want a drink.

40
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:33,531
And I want
to eat Taylor Swift's heart,

41
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:36,200
but we can't always get
what we want.

42
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:38,936
Now get your shifter ass
out of here.

43
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:46,310
I wasn't asking.

44
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:50,648
You werewolves.

45
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,651
You think
you're so special,

46
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:55,386
when really you're
just sons of bitches.

47
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:08,199
That all you got?

48
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:11,168
Oh, trust me,
slugger.

49
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,537
I got more.

50
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:17,408
So much more.

51
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,245
Where you goin',
old yeller?

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,808
Ennis!
Where are we going?

53
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,578
That place --
it wasn't us.

54
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:02,820
So, you dragged me
to a ferry stop, why?

55
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,623
We met on a ferry.

56
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,158
That field trip --
5th grade --

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,861
you had your hair in braids,
and...

58
00:04:10,863 --> 00:04:14,331
And I couldn't take my eyes
off you.

59
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:18,936
Tam,
this is us.

60
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:19,970
So...

61
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:22,906
Oh, my God!

62
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:28,479
Call 911!

63
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,614
Call 911!

64
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:34,852
David...

65
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,120
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:37,454
David?
Who's David?

67
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:39,056
I didn't have
a choice.

68
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:44,295
Tamara! Tamara!

69
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:45,729
No! Ahh!

70
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,874
No! No!

71
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:05,149
No...

72
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,685
Please...

73
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:10,220
Please...

74
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,522
No!

75

77
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:34,012
Professor?
What are you doing here?

78
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:36,480
Uh, my office.

79
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:38,482
Why aren't you at lunch?

80
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:39,817
Paperwork.

81
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,486
I thought you and your wife
had gone away for the weekend.

82
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:44,288
We have -- we are.

83
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,057
I just
forgot something.

84
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:49,193
Don't worry about it.

85
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:20,524
Matt? It's David Lassiter.

86
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:23,961
Spread the word -- I've got
answers to the math final.

87
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:26,497
50 bucks a pop.

88
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:35,839
Teddy's house of pi?atas,
cinnamon speaking.

89
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:36,974
Not funny, David.

90
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,142
Where the hell
are you?!

91
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:39,209
You need
to come home.

92
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:40,377
Margo. Margo.
Slow down.

93
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,146
David, listen to me.
You have to come home now.

94
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:43,147
What do you mean?

95
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,683
It's about Sal.
What about Sal?

96
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:48,719
Our brother's dead.

97
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:52,256
I know what I saw.

98
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:55,459
And you're sure?

99
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:58,362
I mean...sure?

100
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,164
'Cause,
what you're tellin' me...

101
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,633
About this faceless
whatever-it-is?

102
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:04,735
That thing had claws.

103
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:06,136
Look,
maybe you got confused.

104
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:07,938
You know, maybe -- maybe it was
some banger with a knife.

105
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,106
I know what I saw.

106
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:11,208
I am trying to help.
By calling me a liar?!

107
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,311
Wow. You are just like
your old man.

108
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:17,347
Nate Ross
was a great cop.

109
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:19,383
He taught me
everything I know.

110
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:21,852
But his temper
never did him any favors.

111
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:23,720
Look,
you had a tough break,

112
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,355
losin' your dad
as young as you did.

113
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:26,990
And I have done all I can
to help.

114
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:28,459
But if you
go off half-cocked,

115
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,894
spouting this monster crap
or doing something stupid,

116
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:32,362
I can't help you anymore,
Ennis.

117
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,731
I know what I saw.

118
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,402
Agents Bonham and Peart,
FBI.

119
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:39,636
We will take it
from here.

120
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:40,971
Like hell you will.

121
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:43,540
Since when did the Feeb
start working stabbings?

122
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,143
Listen,
uh, Detective...

123
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:49,980
Your, uh, perp
fits a certain profile.

124
00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:55,052
Now, I could go into detail,
but I'm -- I'm not going to.

125
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:56,186
All right.

126
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:59,122
Let's talk
about last night.

127
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,457
Why?

128
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,427
So you can call me crazy,
too?

129
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:04,828
Try us.

130
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:13,270
And when I got to her...

131
00:08:13,272 --> 00:08:17,074
She...She --

132
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:20,744
There is nothing
you could've done.

133
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:23,280
That supposed to
make me feel better?

134
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:27,851
Look,
this thing wasn't human.

135
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:31,188
So what are you gonna do
about it?

136
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,092
I don't know what to tell you,
kid.

137
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,461
There's no such thing
as monsters.

138
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:49,973
Margo, calm down.

139
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:52,209
Don't tell me
to calm down, Detective.

140
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:55,212
Just tell me --
the ghouls, are they with us?

141
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:57,014
Maybe.
Maybe?

142
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:02,819
We don't pay you for "maybe",
Freddie.

143
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:04,888
Cut to the chase.

144
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,356
All right.

145
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:10,327
Well, with your pop the way
he is and now that Sal's gone...

146
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:12,429
The families
have concerns.

147
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:16,733
Tell the ghouls, the Djinn,
and whoever

148
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:18,435
I run
this family now.

149
00:09:18,437 --> 00:09:21,238
So they can either back us,
or I'll bend 'em over,

150
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,907
jam a .45 elbow deep,
and empty the damn clip.

151
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:27,844
Margo.

152
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:33,817
You actually came.

153
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:36,386
Welcome home,
David.

154
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,455
Hey, I'm sorry about Sal.

155
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:40,424
He was a --
he was a good one.

156
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:41,992
What happened to him?

157
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:43,493
Julian Duval happened.

158
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:46,964
He and Sal had words
in the backroom of Il Secundo,

159
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:50,667
then the wolf circled around
and tore that place apart.

160
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:54,838
He clawed out Sal's heart,
and he will bleed for that.

161
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,751
Maybe you can talk some sense
into her,

162
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:09,286
'cause I
sure as hell can't.

163
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:13,023
Margo?

164
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:15,659
What's with
the N.R.A. Christmas in here?

165
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:16,927
What are you doing?

166
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:18,762
We're going to war.

167
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:21,198
You don't like it,
talk to dad.

168
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,007
I didn't know
pop was this bad.

169
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:34,044
You've been gone
three years.

170
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:35,379
Things change.

171
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:39,616
Margo,
are you sure it was Julian?!

172
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:41,151
Costa's got a witness.

173
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:42,586
That saw Julian?

174
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:44,254
He hated Sal.

175
00:10:44,256 --> 00:10:47,424
You knew it, I knew it --
the whole damn city knew it.

176
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:49,226
The dick saw his shot,
and he took it.

177
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:50,060
That's a "no."

178
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:52,062
The mutt
gutted our brother!

179
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:54,064
You don't know that!

180
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,565
And if the werewolves did this --
If?!

181
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:59,169
Look at you --
falling all over yourself

182
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:01,972
to defend the family that's had
their foot on our neck

183
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:03,473
for years.

184
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:07,444
Oh,
it's just like old times.

185
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:14,051
Oh,
by the way...

186
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:17,120
Your ex
is getting married.

187
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:19,656
You know that,
right?

188
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:20,857
Violet?

189
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:23,326
Her father pimped her out
to the New York wolves

190
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:25,429
to seal some deal.

191
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:29,599
I'm not saying
don't fight.

192
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,068
I'm saying be smart.

193
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,236
Find out
what happened.

194
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:37,040
And if Julian did this --
Yeah, you'll what?

195
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:39,042
David,
come on.

196
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:40,944
You don't want this.

197
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:44,047
You ran away
to be a human.

198
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:47,951
You always had a soft spot
for 'em.

199
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:53,457
Look,
you're out.

200
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:54,891
Stay out.

201
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,645
You're sure
I can't get you anything?

202
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,681
Bourbon? Blood?

203
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:19,883
I'm fine.

204
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:24,387
Do you really think
the shifters will make a move?

205
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:27,791
Margo is not stupid.

206
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:29,593
Julian.

207
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:34,898
Not now, Violet.
We need to talk. Please.

208
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:42,038
I just heard --
Sal Lassiter's dead.

209
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,841
Oh, dear.
Whatever shall I do?

210
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:47,210
Did <i>you</i> kill him?

211
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:48,311
No.

212
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:51,248
From the look of his body,
Sal died quick.

213
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,616
Wait,
you saw his body?

214
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:53,917
I'm thorough,
aren't I?

215
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,585
Then who killed him?
Like I care.

216
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:56,853
Why are you meeting
with the Djinn?

217
00:12:56,855 --> 00:13:02,325
Because that whore
Margo Lassiter wants me dead.

218
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:03,860
She thinks
I sliced up her brother,

219
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:05,495
and I'm not gonna tell her
any different.

220
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:07,864
After what those shifters
have done --

221
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:11,968
chipping away at our territory,
insulting us...

222
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,070
There's a war coming.

223
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:16,173
And I need tattoos in there
on my side.

224
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:17,440
Wait, Julian,
stop --

225
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:19,276
What do you think
you're doing?!

226
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,444
You're the bitch in this pack,
princess.

227
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:24,981
Your job is to be pretty
and silent.

228
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:29,252
So war, no war --
you don't get a vote.

229
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:43,133
? Little black submarines,
operator, please ?

230
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:47,370
? put me back on the line

231
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:55,378
? told my girl I'd be back,
operator, please ?

232
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,382
? this is wreckin' my mind ?

233
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:07,524
? oh, can it be
the voices calling me ?

234
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:13,296
? they get lost
and out of time ?

235
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:19,502
? I should've seen it glow,
but everybody knows ?

236
00:14:19,504 --> 00:14:25,542
? that a broken heart
is blind ?

237
00:14:25,544 --> 00:14:33,350
? that a broken heart
is blind ?

238
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:56,773
No! No!

239
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:59,042
Tamara!

240
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:19,122
Chicago P.D.!

241
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:21,257
Stay right
where you are!

242
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:24,027
I don't think so.

243
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:30,567
What the...?

244
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,691
He looks better with a little
off the top, don't you think?

245
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:58,727
You wan to run,
now's the time.

246
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:00,028
I'm not going anywhere

247
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:03,165
until someone tells me
what the hell's going on.

248
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,235
You should go.

249
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:08,337
No.

250
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:13,242
All right, Sammy,
give him the talk.

251
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:17,779
All right, look,
my name is Sam Winchester.

252
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:20,682
That's my brother Dean.

253
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:22,284
We, uh...

254
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:24,720
...we kill vampires.

255
00:17:24,722 --> 00:17:27,523
And werewolves,
and demons, and --

256
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:29,691
basically,
we chase down evil...

257
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:31,460
And we
cut its head off.

258
00:17:31,462 --> 00:17:34,963
So you're,
what, monster cops?

259
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,899
Hunters.

260
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:38,567
Then what
killed my girlfriend?

261
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:41,236
We're working on it,
okay?

262
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:45,407
And from what you told us,
uh, this thing sounds new...

263
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:47,943
or Freddy Krueger.

264
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:50,112
W-what about that guy I saw
in the mirror?

265
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:51,980
With --
with the messed-up face?

266
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:53,081
It's probably a wraith.

267
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,250
Look, a lot of these things,
they can look human

268
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:58,320
until you catch them in a mirror
or sometimes a camera.

269
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:00,989
So -- so you find this --
this whatever, a-and you're --

270
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:02,658
you're gonna chop
its head off?

271
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:08,063
Yeah, or sometimes, when in
doubt, try a silver bullet.

272
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,164
Hey, Sammy.

273
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,165
Yep?

274
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:13,001
This is full of -- of blood
and meat.

275
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:14,303
A lot of meat.

276
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:16,738
Actually,
this one, uh...

277
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,107
This one's labeled "Susan."

278
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:23,545
What is this,
some kind of backroom...

279
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:24,713
Monster V.I.P.

280
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:28,317
Yeah, well, if it is
and Sal Lassiter was here...

281
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,484
Then he's not human.

282
00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:32,254
So, what, we got monsters
killing monsters now?

283
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:33,355
Maybe.

284
00:18:33,357 --> 00:18:35,057
We got to see the body.
I'm coming with you.

285
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:36,458
No.
You're gonna stay.

286
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,859
Or what? Huh?

287
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:39,695
You gonna hurt me?

288
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:41,763
Kill the girl I love?

289
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:43,699
Ruin my damn life?!

290
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:46,201
Yeah,
you're too late.

291
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,469
Ennis, listen.

292
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:48,570
I get it.

293
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:50,372
Believe me,
I've been there.

294
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:53,041
But what we do?
It's messed up.

295
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:55,444
So do yourself a favor
and stay out.

296
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,379
You can get hurt,
too.

297
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:00,782
Okay.

298
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:31,179
Hey.
Can we talk?

299
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:32,414
About what?

300
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,815
Last night.

301
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:37,919
This thing you think killed
Tamara, what'd it look like?

302
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:39,187
Thing?

303
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:42,224
You said it was
"some banger with a knife."

304
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,493
Chasing down every lead,
kid.

305
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:57,339
Like I told you,
it didn't have much of a face.

306
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:01,543
He -- it -- whatever --
say anything?

307
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:03,278
I told you that,
too.

308
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,646
Then tell me again.

309
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:09,184
Hey, if you got the time,
why don't you hang around?

310
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:12,187
Dad's working the graveyard,
but he'll be home soon.

311
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:14,256
And he'd love
to see you.

312
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:18,660
Sure.
Be good to see him, too.

313
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:21,697
Sorry.

314
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:23,265
Text.

315
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:29,037
No worries.

316
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,339
Look, Ennis.

317
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:34,342
I, uh...
I know this is hard.

318
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:37,112
See, uh, that thing slashed up
my jacket pretty good.

319
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:40,015
Forensics went over it, but --
well, you want to see?

320
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:42,851
That'd be great.

321
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:54,096
I appreciate this,
kid.

322
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:56,264
Really.

323
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,901
Hey.

324
00:20:59,903 --> 00:21:01,770
Look, there's a silver bullet
in this gun!

325
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:02,771
Ennis.

326
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:03,972
Ennis, don't --

327
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:06,975
you're not Freddie Costa,
so who are you?!

328
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,044
My name
is David Lassiter.

329
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:11,747
I'm a shapeshifter.

330
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:13,982
You're a what?!

331
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:15,283
We shift...our shape.

332
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:17,886
Um, it's kinda all there
in the name.

333
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:20,122
Sal Lassiter
was my brother.

334
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:21,857
I'm just trying to find out
who killed him.

335
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:23,992
So you slap on
somebody else's face, huh?!

336
00:21:23,994 --> 00:21:25,293
It's kind of my go-to.

337
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:27,496
Look,
I read the police report.

338
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:28,997
I know you lost someone,
too.

339
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:29,998
Oh, shut up!

340
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,700
See,
you don't talk about her!

341
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:41,543
You know what's going on
out there?

342
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:43,545
Do you have any idea?

343
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:45,514
Freaks. Hunters.

344
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:46,648
Yeah,
I got the basics.

345
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,552
Wow.

346
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:52,320
You are so
in over your head.

347
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:54,990
Let me give you
the short version.

348
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:58,994
Chicago is divided up
between five monster families.

349
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:02,230
What? Is that a joke?
Do you hear a laugh track?

350
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:03,331
What about the police?

351
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,833
We own the police.

352
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:08,670
Look, I'm talking shakedowns,
organ trafficking.

353
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:10,505
The werewolves
running the Gold Coast,

354
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:12,340
the Djinn
owning the South Side.

355
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:18,547
But we want to keep a low
profile, so...We keep the peace.

356
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,916
And human casualties
to a minimum.

357
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:21,917
A minimum?

358
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,685
Look, I don't like it either,
okay?

359
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:25,720
But you know
what's behind door #2?

360
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:27,022
War.

361
00:22:27,024 --> 00:22:31,593
That's blood -- human
and monster -- in the street.

362
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:32,961
And right now?

363
00:22:32,963 --> 00:22:36,765
There's exactly one guy
trying to stop it.

364
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:40,969
Wow. You know,
good for you.

365
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:44,105
I'd slow clap, but, well,
my hands are a little full.

366
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:49,511
Just stay out of it,
okay?

367
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:57,352
These cuts are flecked
with silver.

368
00:22:57,354 --> 00:22:58,520
How do you know?

369
00:22:58,522 --> 00:22:59,888
Because it burns.

370
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,922
So?

371
00:23:00,924 --> 00:23:03,091
Julian Duval
hasn't got silver claws.

372
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:04,593
He's a werewolf.

373
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:11,099
Hey! Hey!

374
00:23:50,216 --> 00:23:51,950
So, get this.

375
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:58,323
The, uh, coroner says this guy,
this, uh, Julian Duval,

376
00:23:58,325 --> 00:24:02,427
shows up, drops 3 grand
to see Sal's corpse.

377
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:04,562
And he lives
in a friggin' castle.

378
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:05,563
Who is this guy?

379
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:06,798
Well,
if we're lucky,

380
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,501
someone who knows what happened
to that monster boy.

381
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:16,207
Madame.

382
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,846
You can cut the act,
David.

383
00:24:23,816 --> 00:24:27,218
How did you --
I know you.

384
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,021
Yeah,
well, ditto.

385
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:36,161
Is the real butler okay?

386
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:39,397
He's resting.

387
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,666
Locked in a closet.

388
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:42,934
You shouldn't be here.

389
00:24:42,936 --> 00:24:45,437
You think
I want to be here?

390
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:49,240
It's about Sal.

391
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:54,746
I heard.
I'm so sorry.

392
00:24:54,748 --> 00:24:56,681
Julian didn't do it.
Yeah, I know.

393
00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:57,982
That's why I need you
to talk your brother,

394
00:24:57,984 --> 00:24:59,284
get him
to a have a sit-down with Margo,

395
00:24:59,286 --> 00:25:00,485
so they can just work
this crap out.

396
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:01,453
There's no way
that's happening.

397
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:03,988
We can stop a war,
Violet.

398
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,759
One, Julian doesn't want
to stop this, and second, how?

399
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:09,928
You're a runaway
and I'm...

400
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,297
I'm a bitch.
We don't matter.

401
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,266
What's wrong with you?

402
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:17,435
Since when
do you play their game?

403
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:18,570
And since when
do you let your dad

404
00:25:18,572 --> 00:25:19,637
sell you to some dick
from New York?

405
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:20,872
You think
I had a choice?!

406
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:22,006
You did!

407
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:24,375
Union Station.

408
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:26,578
Midnight.
You had a choice.

409
00:25:28,013 --> 00:25:31,082
You --

410
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:34,352
you're the one
who said we should go away,

411
00:25:34,354 --> 00:25:37,622
live a normal life.

412
00:25:37,624 --> 00:25:42,060
You set the time,
the place...

413
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:44,596
And I was there.

414
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:48,600
Where were you?

415
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:55,673
Run!

416
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:31,176
Violet! Violet!

417
00:26:40,753 --> 00:26:42,487
What the hell's
going on?!

418
00:26:42,489 --> 00:26:44,289
It took her.
Wait, who are you?

419
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,957
His name's David Lassiter.
He's a shapeshifter.

420
00:26:47,194 --> 00:26:48,526
Hey,
we got to go.

421
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:50,695
Now! Let's go!

422
00:26:59,072 --> 00:27:01,172
All right,
everybody out.

423
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:09,314
So you're tellin' me
there are five monster families

424
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:11,115
that run Chicago?

425
00:27:11,117 --> 00:27:13,451
What is this,
"The Godfather" with fangs?

426
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:16,154
Well, if it is, I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

427
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,455
Well,
he doesn't quit.

428
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:18,523
I'll give him that.

429
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:19,624
Violet's not picking up.

430
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:21,793
Wait, so this girl,
she a shifter, too?

431
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:22,694
Werewolf.

432
00:27:22,696 --> 00:27:25,196
Awesome. Awesome.

433
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:29,934
If she has her cell,
we could trace the signal.

434
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:31,436
Yeah,
you might be right.

435
00:27:31,438 --> 00:27:33,037
All right.
What's her number?

436
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,539
Take me with you,
and it's all yours.

437
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,140
No!

438
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:39,377
Oh, hell no!

439
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:41,212
Dude,
he's a freakin' transformer.

440
00:27:41,214 --> 00:27:43,815
And sometimes you
got to work with the bad guys

441
00:27:43,817 --> 00:27:45,250
to get to the worse guys.

442
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:47,685
Dude,
I'm right here.

443
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,520
Yeah,
I see you.

444
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:31,729
You think
I'm some freak...

445
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:34,165
Like you.

446
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:41,973
But I'm not.

447
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:57,488
I'm just a man...

448
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:03,528
With some
fun little toys.

449
00:29:24,615 --> 00:29:27,550
Signal's coming from
in there.

450
00:29:30,455 --> 00:29:32,456
Hey.

451
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,558
Thanks for...You know.

452
00:29:35,627 --> 00:29:36,861
And about your girlfriend,
I'm --

453
00:29:36,863 --> 00:29:38,095
Look, I don't need no apology
from you.

454
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:40,197
I lost someone, too,
okay?!

455
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:43,133
But I'm trying here.

456
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:48,839
I'm sorry
about your brother.

457
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:53,444
He spoke about you
at the end.

458
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:56,480
He said,
"David, I'm sorry.

459
00:29:56,482 --> 00:29:58,415
I didn't have
a choice."

460
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:01,352
All right, you guys
can kiss and make up later.

461
00:30:01,354 --> 00:30:02,586
We got work to do.
Come on.

462
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:07,191
Silver.

463
00:30:07,193 --> 00:30:13,063
It burns
if you're evil.

464
00:30:13,065 --> 00:30:14,665
If you're a monster.

465
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:20,437
No! No!

466
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:23,007
You look at him!

467
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:26,410
He was my son.

468
00:30:26,412 --> 00:30:31,582
And your brother
and the shifter, Lassiter...

469
00:30:32,617 --> 00:30:34,084
They ripped him apart.

470
00:30:38,757 --> 00:30:41,592
The police told me
that it was a wild animal.

471
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:45,729
And I believed them
for years.

472
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:48,899
But now
I know the truth.

473
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:51,635
Please,
Sal and Julian hated each other,

474
00:30:51,637 --> 00:30:53,270
and neither of them
would hurt a kid.

475
00:30:53,272 --> 00:30:55,606
Why should I believe you?
You're dead.

476
00:30:55,608 --> 00:31:00,911
Tomorrow, they will find
pieces of you all over town.

477
00:31:03,815 --> 00:31:07,351
Oh,
won't the doggies be mad?

478
00:31:07,353 --> 00:31:09,553
That's what you want.

479
00:31:09,555 --> 00:31:12,856
You're trying
to start a war.

480
00:31:12,858 --> 00:31:16,927
When freaks start killin' freaks
we win.

481
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:18,262
No.

482
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:22,066
Once this starts, do you
have any idea how many people --

483
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:24,835
how many children
will die?

484
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:46,690
All right,
you're with me, Romeo.

485
00:31:46,692 --> 00:31:48,959
Sounds good,
Buffy.

486
00:32:50,288 --> 00:32:52,756
Kid?

487
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:55,926
David?!

488
00:33:00,098 --> 00:33:02,466
I'm so sorry, Violet.

489
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:13,110
Guess I'm gonna have to make
an example of you, too.

490
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:14,144
No!

491
00:33:14,146 --> 00:33:16,080
Don't hurt her!
Why?!

492
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:19,016
Hmm?!

493
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:23,153
'Cause she's
your girlfriend? Hmm?

494
00:33:23,155 --> 00:33:24,955
Yeah,
I heard you talking.

495
00:33:24,957 --> 00:33:27,558
Real sweet.
Hell, it was almost human.

496
00:33:29,394 --> 00:33:31,295
Almost.

497
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:46,343
Here's the thing -- you
can look human and act human...

498
00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:48,178
But deep down?

499
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,180
You're just a monster.

500
00:34:01,793 --> 00:34:03,093
Violet, no! Please!

501
00:34:04,295 --> 00:34:05,529
Please!

502
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:06,730
Violet.

503
00:34:06,732 --> 00:34:10,300
Please.

504
00:34:17,075 --> 00:34:19,610
It's all right.
It's all right.

505
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:30,621
What'd we miss?

506
00:34:33,124 --> 00:34:35,325
I know you.

507
00:34:35,327 --> 00:34:38,328
I'm sorry
about your girl.

508
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:43,867
But she was in the way.

509
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:46,603
You understand.

510
00:34:46,605 --> 00:34:49,206
I know you do.

511
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,575
They're monsters!

512
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,548
I only see
one monster here.

513
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:22,623
You all right?

514
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:24,325
I will be.

515
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:25,759
Are you?

516
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:30,097
I'll get back to you
on that.

517
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:34,335
Sal --
he said he was sorry.

518
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:39,740
Those were his last words --
"David, I'm sorry.

519
00:35:39,742 --> 00:35:40,975
I didn't
have a choice."

520
00:35:40,977 --> 00:35:44,111
But Sal never
did anything to me.

521
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:47,348
Why would he say that?

522
00:35:55,156 --> 00:35:58,392
Sal, what are you do--

523
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:03,564
He's not coming, is he?

524
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:06,166
David'll be here
in a few minutes.

525
00:36:06,168 --> 00:36:07,101
You won't be.

526
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:10,337
Why are you
doing this?

527
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:12,473
'Cause he's my little brother,
Violet.

528
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:14,141
It's my job
to protect him.

529
00:36:14,143 --> 00:36:16,143
It's my job
to keep our blood pure.

530
00:36:16,145 --> 00:36:18,546
You believe
that bloodline crap?

531
00:36:18,548 --> 00:36:19,947
We all do.

532
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:22,349
Bloodlines --
everyone knowing our place.

533
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:24,418
It's the one thing
we all agree on.

534
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,354
If your people find out
you ran off with a shifter,

535
00:36:27,356 --> 00:36:29,890
they'll be lookin'
for payback.

536
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:31,392
And they'll come after
my family.

537
00:36:31,394 --> 00:36:34,862
And then it's nothin'
but bad times and dead bodies

538
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:36,030
on both sides.

539
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:38,732
David wants to go straight,
that's his call.

540
00:36:38,734 --> 00:36:40,768
But he does it alone.

541
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,004
So you have a choice,
Violet --

542
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:47,107
you could either
walk out of here alive...

543
00:36:50,145 --> 00:36:54,114
...or I'll take you out and dump
what's left of you in the lake.

544
00:36:57,018 --> 00:36:58,586
Sal?

545
00:36:58,588 --> 00:37:01,355
I love him.

546
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:04,358
I wish
that mattered.

547
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:14,335
Even after I left the family,

548
00:37:14,337 --> 00:37:15,769
I knew
if things got bad

549
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:20,908
that Sal
would always have my back.

550
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,409
So...

551
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:25,813
What did he mean?

552
00:37:25,815 --> 00:37:29,783
I don't know.

553
00:37:29,785 --> 00:37:31,185
I should go.

554
00:37:31,187 --> 00:37:32,653
Sure. Right.

555
00:37:32,655 --> 00:37:35,255
That's what you do best.

556
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:40,694
David...

557
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,025
Pop?

558
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,664
What?

559
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:20,801
Your sister --
she wants war.

560
00:38:20,803 --> 00:38:23,804
You have to stop her.

561
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:32,379
All this was some...

562
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:34,081
Messed-up guy.

563
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,316
The Duvals are clean.

564
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:38,686
Fine.
We done?

565
00:38:38,688 --> 00:38:40,721
And I'm coming back
to the family.

566
00:38:40,723 --> 00:38:42,656
I thought
you were out.

567
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:45,325
Well,
now I'm back in.

568
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:56,336
I've waited a long time
to hear you say that.

569
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,584
Welcome home,
David.

570
00:39:37,912 --> 00:39:39,947
You live here alone?

571
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:41,749
My sister's
on the other side of town,

572
00:39:41,751 --> 00:39:43,517
my mom's out of the picture,
and my dad...

573
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:44,718
Well,
he died.

574
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,787
Line of duty.
A long time ago.

575
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:48,522
I'm sorry
to hear that.

576
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:51,191
Yeah?

577
00:39:51,193 --> 00:39:53,093
So, what's next?
Nothing, you're done.

578
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:55,696
Okay.

579
00:39:55,698 --> 00:39:57,431
We're on our way. Yeah.

580
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,835
Just give me
a second.

581
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,607
- Yeah?
- We've got a gig.

582
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:07,708
You want to leave?

583
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,210
Dean, this city
is crawling with monsters.

584
00:40:10,212 --> 00:40:11,945
Cass has a line
on Metatron.

585
00:40:11,947 --> 00:40:13,981
This is what
we've been waiting for.

586
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:15,649
This is our shot,
Sam.

587
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:20,687
You're going?

588
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:23,090
Look, we'll, uh -- we'll call in
some other hunters, some pros,

589
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:25,359
and download them on the monster
mob situation, all of it.

590
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:26,393
Look, guys,
I co--

591
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:28,362
Ennis, seriously.
Don't.

592
00:40:28,364 --> 00:40:32,132
You get into this too deep,
there's no getting out.

593
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,420
But I couldn't walk away.

594
00:40:53,422 --> 00:40:54,988
This is my fight now.

595
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:59,793
Hell, it's a damn war,
and I got to start somewhere.

596
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,792
Hello?

597
00:41:31,794 --> 00:41:33,760
What are you doing?

598
00:41:33,762 --> 00:41:34,928
Who is this?

599
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,564
If you start hunting,
the monsters will kill you.

600
00:41:37,566 --> 00:41:39,099
Dad?

601
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:43,136
Dad?

602
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:48,161
