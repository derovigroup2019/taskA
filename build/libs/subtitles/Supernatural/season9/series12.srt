1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,771
You lied to me.
Again.

2
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:06,256
You decide to trick me
into being possessed

3
00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:08,442
by some...psycho angel?

4
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:09,443
And now...

5
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:11,211
Kevin's blood
is on my hands.

6
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:12,379
But I'll find Gadreel.

7
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:13,814
And I will end
that son of a bitch.

8
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:15,949
But I'll do it alone.
What's that supposed to mean?

9
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:19,069
Sam, people get close to me,
they get killed...or worse.

10
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:20,738
Just go.

11
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,439
I'm not gonna stop you.

12
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,458
It's the bloody mark of Cain.

13
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,909
The mark and the blade
work together.

14
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:28,078
I can give you the mark, Dean,
if it's what you truly want.

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,112
The mark can be transferred.

16
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:31,548
I called a friend of ours --
Garth.

17
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,133
He does what we do...
In his own way.

18
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:34,385
Stop being a idjit!

19
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:36,119
Now, you know
what's coming next, right?

20
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:37,454
Man, this is good.

21
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:40,724
Oh, Marmaduke, you're crazy!

22
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:42,676
Where's Garth?

23
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:43,927
On a case or --
or the dentist.

24
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:45,262
I don't know.
I haven't heard from him.

25
00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:46,814
Garth still M.I.A.?

26
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,318
Hey!

27
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:45,352

29
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:53,915
Afternoon.

30
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:55,433
I'm looking for a John Doe

31
00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:57,385
that was admitted here
a few days ago.

32
00:01:57,387 --> 00:01:59,270
He's a, uh...

33
00:01:59,272 --> 00:02:02,640
skinny...Ichabod Crane-looking
kind of guy.

34
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:05,560
I know just who you mean.
Room 113, agent.

35
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:06,978
All right, thanks.

36
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,646
Sure is a popular fella.

37
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:35,707
Saw Garth's John Doe
on the police wire.

38
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:37,342
You?

39
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,127
Yeah.

40
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,929
Where you comin' from?

41
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:42,463
New Mexico.

42
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,682
Well, that's a haul.

43
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:48,136
Especially considering
that I got this, uh...

44
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:49,270
pretty much covered,

45
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:50,905
so if you want to...

46
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:52,824
You spoken to him yet?

47
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,193
No.

48
00:02:55,195 --> 00:02:56,611
Assload of painkillers.

49
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,496
He's been out
since I got here.

50
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:01,783
What's
he being charged with?

51
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:04,536
Killing a cow.

52
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:05,854
Why?

53
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,106
I was about to see
if I could find out.

54
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:10,458
Lock the door.

55
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:17,098
Whoa. Hey.
What is that? Adrenaline?

56
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,266
Yes, sir.

57
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:20,018
You trying to jump-start him
or kill him?

58
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,136
I want some answers.

59
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:23,721
He walked out on Kevin.
He walked out on us.

60
00:03:23,723 --> 00:03:25,390
So if you got
a better idea...

61
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:33,114
Aah! Aah! Aah!

62
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:37,318
Dean?

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,287
Sam?

64
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:42,857
What is this?
A hospital?

65
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:45,359
Wait.
Am I in Heaven?

66
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,862
All right, take it easy, Garth.
You're in Wisconsin.

67
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:49,631
You were hit by a car.

68
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:51,699
Do you remember anything?

69
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,635
I, uh...

70
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:55,970
Vaguely.

71
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:58,706
What's with the hardware?

72
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,141
<i>You</i> tell <i>us.</i>

73
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:02,093
And while you're at it, why
don't you give us the lowdown

74
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:03,895
on why you went AWOL
for the past six months?

75
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:07,565
Only way we tracked you down
is that you offed a cow.

76
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:10,852
Offed a...what?

77
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:12,770
I -- I --
I was on a hunt.

78
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:14,222
Hunt for what?

79
00:04:14,224 --> 00:04:16,557
I --

80
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,575
oh, no.

81
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:18,893
Oh, get back.

82
00:04:18,895 --> 00:04:20,728
Ohh. Oh, God.

83
00:04:26,752 --> 00:04:29,337
Good thing I didn't give him
the adrenaline.

84
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:38,296
Anything on Gadreel?

85
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:39,681
Actually, uh, yeah.

86
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:41,299
Turns out he, uh,

87
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:43,801
he left some Grace in me
before he bolted.

88
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:48,389
You know how wrong
that sounds, right?

89
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:51,226
Wouldn't worry about it.
Cass took care of it.

90
00:04:52,427 --> 00:04:53,862
Hmm.

91
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:55,063
What?

92
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:56,314
Nothing.

93
00:04:56,316 --> 00:04:57,615
I'm gone for two weeks,

94
00:04:57,617 --> 00:05:00,218
and you're like an episode
of "Teen Mom."

95
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:06,908
Just breathe, Garth.
Work it out.

96
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:15,049
What happened
to your arm?

97
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:16,251
Oh.

98
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:19,187
It's a...

99
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:20,838
Gift from Cain.

100
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,925
Like...the wrestler?

101
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,626
I wish.

102
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:27,061
That would be awesome.

103
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:29,797
Uh, no. The, uh...
The old testament dude.

104
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:34,903
He got all biblical on me
and gave me his mark.

105
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:37,272
What does it even mean?
How -- how did that happen?

106
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:40,491
Crowley and I found him,
and he gave me this

107
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:42,944
so that I could eighty-six
Abaddon once and for all.

108
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:44,846
You worked a job
with Crowley?

109
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:48,449
The devil you know...

110
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:53,421
Garth?

111
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,007
What?

112
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,267
Son of a bitch.

113
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:12,173
Why would Garth run
from us?

114
00:06:12,175 --> 00:06:14,525
Why haven't we heard from him
for the last six months?

115
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,893
Did you test him?

116
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:18,980
He was unconscious.
No, I --

117
00:06:18,982 --> 00:06:21,783
he steal a car?

118
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:24,619
Did he...
steal a car naked?

119
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:30,408
I'll see what I can find
on those cameras.

120
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,526
Why don't you go talk
to farmer Brown,

121
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:34,195
see about that cow?
Yeah.

122
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,883
Last week,
it was a couple of chickens.

123
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:40,918
Goat the week before that.

124
00:06:42,304 --> 00:06:44,422
So when I saw that boy
tearing out of my barn,

125
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:46,474
hell yeah,
I was gonna ask questions later.

126
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:48,926
Now, the animals -- were they
all killed in the same manner?

127
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:50,395
More like sacrificed.

128
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:51,729
What do you mean by that?

129
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:54,515
Their organs
was ripped clean out.

130
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,067
Only the organs.

131
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:58,236
If this wasn't some kind
of devil-worship thing,

132
00:06:58,238 --> 00:06:59,354
I don't know what.

133
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:01,823
Mm.

134
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,274
Well, thanks.

135
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:06,527
Yeah.

136
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,896
So,
the cow wasn't just killed.

137
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:10,615
It was eviscerated.

138
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:11,899
Well,
why was Garth there?

139
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,284
He said he was on a hunt,
right?

140
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:15,119
Maybe he was hunting
whatever killed it.

141
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:16,504
Why would he run?

142
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:18,406
This whole thing's starting
to stink. You know that, right?

143
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:19,674
Yeah.

144
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:20,792
What about you?

145
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:22,210
Any luck?

146
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:23,761
Uh, nada.

147
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:25,546
Cameras were pointing
in the wrong direction.

148
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:27,465
You're kidding.

149
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:28,866
Wish I was.

150
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:31,019
Hmm. So --

151
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:33,604
so Garth's a hunter. If he wants
to stay gone, he's gone.

152
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:35,390
We got nothing?

153
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:37,591
Well, what can I say, Sammy?
We lost this one.

154
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:39,113
Send me a postcard.
Send me a postcard.

155
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:43,948
Wow.

156
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,119
Make, model, license plate.

157
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:49,487
Really, Dean?

158
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:51,906
I told you
we can't hunt together.

159
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:55,743
It's for your own good.

160
00:07:55,745 --> 00:07:57,128
I hear you.

161
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,580
And after we find Garth and get
to the bottom of this, I'm gone.

162
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:02,467
But until then,
no more games.

163
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,839
Ride belongs
to a girl named Bess Meyers.

164
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,891
She lives
in the next town over.

165
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:12,293
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!

166
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:13,294
Hey, guys.

167
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:15,796
I can explain.

168
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:18,683
Everything's cool.
Just a simple misunderstanding.

169
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:20,801
Who you talking to?
What?

170
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:21,903
The girl?

171
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:23,654
What -- what girl?

172
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,325
What the --

173
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:28,576
what, now?

174
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:30,695
All right, all right.

175
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:32,196
Guys, everyone
needs to take a chill pill

176
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:33,915
and put their guns down.

177
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:40,171
You see?

178
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:43,291
Let's all be grown-ups here
and have an adult conversation.

179
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:49,964
No!

180
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:54,886
Sam!

181
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:57,605
Sam, please --
don't hurt her.

182
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:59,006
What are you doing?!
She's a werewolf!

183
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:03,478
So am I.

184
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:19,477
It's okay, baby.
Hold it like that.

185
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,262
What are they doing here,
Garth?

186
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,297
They're friends.
I promise.

187
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:24,649
They're hunters.

188
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:29,153
All right. We've all gotten off
on the wrong foot here.

189
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:30,405
So let's do things right.

190
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:33,390
Boys...this is Bess...

191
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:35,827
My beloved.

192
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:39,063
And, Bess, that's Dean.

193
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:40,948
Now, he could start a fight
in an empty house,

194
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,999
but deep down inside,

195
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:44,368
he's just
a big ol' Teddy bear.

196
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,088
And Sam here -- Sam can be
a bit insecure at times,

197
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,405
but for good reason.

198
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:50,291
Bless his heart.

199
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:52,176
That's sweet.

200
00:09:52,178 --> 00:09:53,461
Werewolf?

201
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:56,547
All right, guys, look --
about six months ago,

202
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:59,600
I was outside Portland, Maine,
hunting this big bad wolf.

203
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:02,270
I took him down, but...
He bit me in the process.

204
00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:04,272
And you didn't call
one of us?

205
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:06,641
And tell you what?
That I messed up?

206
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:08,860
No, I-I knew the deal.

207
00:10:08,862 --> 00:10:12,230
There's no cure,
so I accepted my fate.

208
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:15,266
Ate my favorite dish
of egg fu Yung,

209
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:17,452
watched the world's
greatest movie, "Rocky III""

210
00:10:17,454 --> 00:10:20,037
and then...
was ready to eat a bullet,

211
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,772
when Bess here found me.

212
00:10:21,774 --> 00:10:23,541
And how'd she do that?

213
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:26,210
Smelled him.
How else?

214
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:28,546
Yeah.

215
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:30,498
She talked the gun
out of my mouth,

216
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,834
and, as they say,
the rest is history.

217
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:35,253
We've been married
for four months now.

218
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:36,754
You're married?

219
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:38,189
To a werewolf.

220
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,307
Yes.

221
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,425
And my pack has taken him in
as one of our own.

222
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:45,629
Guys,
it's not what you think.

223
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,098
We don't hurt people.

224
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,067
No, you just go all Wolverine
on cattle.

225
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:51,853
Yeah.

226
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:54,272
At least
he's not eating human hearts.

227
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:56,407
Do you have any idea
how hard it is for a bitten

228
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:59,494
to control his instincts,
like Garth does?

229
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,412
How well he's doing?

230
00:11:01,414 --> 00:11:03,364
Thank you, baby.

231
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,032
Well, it's the truth,
honey bunny.

232
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:06,984
Wait. A -- a "bitten"?

233
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:09,086
You're <i>all</i> bitten.

234
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:10,087
Not at all.

235
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:11,873
You're either born to it,
like I was,

236
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,792
or you're bitten,
like Garth.

237
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:15,943
Hold on.

238
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:18,930
You said you were --
you were <i>born</i> a werewolf?

239
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:21,799
Second generation.

240
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:26,053
Garth, can we talk to you
for a sec? Alone?

241
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:32,660
Honey, why don't you go find
some ointment for that arm?

242
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:34,779
Okay?

243
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:39,984
What the hell?

244
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:42,537
Look, I know
you guys want to shoot first

245
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,856
and ask questions later,
but I checked everything out.

246
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:47,358
This pack is clean.

247
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,626
Everything's Kosher.

248
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:51,078
Right. Uh, minus the part
where your wife attacked me.

249
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,382
Yeah, because you two came busting
in here like a house on fire.

250
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:56,634
Guns waving,
the jawlines and the hair --

251
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:57,802
it's very intimidating.

252
00:11:57,804 --> 00:12:00,471
What'd you expect?

253
00:12:00,473 --> 00:12:03,591
Dean, no one wants
any trouble.

254
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:05,059
You got my word on that.

255
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:07,395
Oh, no.
That ship has sailed.

256
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:10,097
We're gonna need a hell of a lot
more than your word.

257
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,548
Okay. Okay.

258
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,883
Tell you what.

259
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:15,586
You want proof?
Come pray with us.

260
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:28,916
You there?

261
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,635
Yeah, just pulled up.

262
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:33,070
Nothing too sketchy yet.

263
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:34,589
That's a good thing,
right?

264
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:36,540
Not betting on it.

265
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,759
Or are we
just that jaded?

266
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:40,577
I mean,
maybe Garth's right.

267
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:43,214
Well, ain't you
a glass half full.

268
00:12:43,216 --> 00:12:44,799
Any luck with the cops?

269
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,934
Uh, sheriff should be rolling up
any second.

270
00:12:46,936 --> 00:12:48,552
Be careful.

271
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:50,471
Yeah.

272
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:54,692
? Bringing in the sheaves

273
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:56,944
We need to come
in strong on the second verse.

274
00:12:56,946 --> 00:12:58,145
Let's try it again.

275
00:12:58,147 --> 00:12:59,947
Garth, play it from here.

276
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:00,982
And...

277
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:04,435
? bringing in the sheaves

278
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:05,953
You must be Dean.

279
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:08,072
I'm Joy,
Garth's mother-in-law.

280
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:09,373
Uh, stepmother-in-law,

281
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,876
which I always thought
sounded so silly.

282
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:14,545
Please, come in.
We're just finishing up.

283
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:16,163
Why don't you just tell Garth
I'm here?

284
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:20,784
Dean, you have my word --
you're safe under my roof.

285
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:22,837
I only ask the same
in return.

286
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,805
After all...

287
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:27,508
I'm not the one
carrying silver.

288
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,227
? Bringing in the sheaves

289
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:32,963
? bringing in the sheaves

290
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:35,900
? we shall come rejoicing

291
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:38,903
? bringing in the sheaves

292
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:41,856
? bringing in the sheaves

293
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:44,608
? bringing in the sheaves

294
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,578
? we shall come rejoicing

295
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,748
? bringing in the sheaves

296
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,484
? bringing in the sheaves

297
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:56,320
? bringing in the sheaves

298
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:59,290
? we shall come rejoicing

299
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:04,045
? bringing in the sheaves

300
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:09,166
Uh...Thank you,
brother Garth.

301
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:11,435
Wonderful accompaniment,
as usual.

302
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:15,339
And I'll see the rest of you
in the pews -- 9:00 a.m., sharp.

303
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:18,442
No stragglers...Sister Amelia.

304
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,514
Oh. Hi.

305
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:27,401
So, what'd I tell you?
It's all good, right?

306
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,040
Everyone here's a wolf?

307
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,041
Yeah.

308
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:35,242
Yeah, not all good.

309
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:37,878
Oh, come on, Dean.
You just got to meet them.

310
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,296
That's Russ and Joba,

311
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:42,533
Bess' first cousins
on sister Joy's side.

312
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:44,552
That's reverend Jim,
Bess' dad --

313
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:46,554
leader of the pack
and a good man.

314
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:48,472
"Dean," isn't it?

315
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:49,807
Welcome.

316
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,225
Jim Meyers.
Folks usually call me...

317
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:52,810
Reverend Jim.
Yeah, I got it.

318
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,064
Oh.
Uh, my bad.

319
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:59,400
Dean's got
this crazy fear of germs.

320
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:03,404
I understand
your apprehension, Dean.

321
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:06,223
Hunters and our kind don't have
the best history together.

322
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:09,410
But I think you'll find we're
not much different from you.

323
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:11,245
Oh, sister,
I highly doubt it.

324
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:13,247
Why don't we break bread
and see?

325
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:15,583
Why would I do that?

326
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:23,257
Dean.

327
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:25,459
What?

328
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:32,433
Now, everybody eat up.

329
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:34,301
But make sure
you leave room for pie.

330
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:37,555
Sister Joy's pies are famous
throughout the badger state.

331
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,808
Mm. Dean loves pie.

332
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:46,063
Mmm.

333
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,043
Don't you guys say some sort
of a Grace or something?

334
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,829
We're more spiritual
than we are religious.

335
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:04,048
We believe, much like
the American Indians did,

336
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,716
that nature and man
are one.

337
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:08,836
Yeah, really worked out well
for <i>them.</i>

338
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:23,851
So, why are
a bunch of werewolves

339
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:26,070
wearing silver bullets
around their necks?

340
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,491
Sorry, Dean, but we don't use
the "W" word around here.

341
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:32,226
We prefer the term
"lycanthrope."

342
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:34,078
"We"?

343
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:37,248
He's entitled
to his opinion, Garth.

344
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,501
Many of our kind see themselves
as indestructible.

345
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:42,870
This is
a constant reminder

346
00:16:42,872 --> 00:16:45,289
of how precious
our lives truly are.

347
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,875
Yeah, but it's silver.
I mean, doesn't it burn?

348
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:50,344
Yeah, it does a bit,
but that's kind of the point.

349
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:51,979
It reminds us
of our fragility.

350
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:54,932
My daughter, Bess,
was born a lycanthrope.

351
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:57,268
It was one of the proudest days
of my life.

352
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,437
Which soon turned tragic...

353
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,556
When a hunter
killed my wife.

354
00:17:02,558 --> 00:17:07,728
Believe me when I tell you,
I wanted to make someone pay.

355
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,233
Then I looked at Bess,
and I realized

356
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:14,485
the road to revenge
is a dark and lonely one,

357
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:15,569
which you never get off.

358
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:17,955
And that hole
in the pit of your stomach,

359
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:20,374
you never fill it -- ever.

360
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:24,495
Hey, no, I get it.

361
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:29,133
So I chose to look forward,
not backwards.

362
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:32,035
And the minute I did that,
the powers that be brought

363
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:36,540
this beautiful, compassionate,
amazing woman into my life.

364
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,542
And she helped me raise
a little baby girl

365
00:17:38,544 --> 00:17:40,427
as if Bess were her own.

366
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:43,647
I can't take all the credit.

367
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,382
Daddy had a hand in it,
too.

368
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:46,650
He saw your potential.

369
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:48,736
Daddy?

370
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:52,606
My father --
bless his soul --

371
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:55,242
was the previous reverend
of our church,

372
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:58,061
the third generation
in our family to serve.

373
00:17:58,063 --> 00:18:00,781
So, you're
fourth-generation werewolf?

374
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:02,366
Yes.

375
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:09,757
Look, the good reverend Jim
and his family

376
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,710
are all a little new-agey
and hippie-dippy like,

377
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:16,747
but they're clean as a whistle
and pillars of our community.

378
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:18,465
Why is the FBI
even interested in them?

379
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,218
I just go
where they send me, sheriff.

380
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,270
Truth be told,
I'm more interested in, uh...

381
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:25,389
Murders
and "X-files"-y stuff.

382
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:27,758
Anything of that variety
around here?

383
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,893
No, sir.
We're just a small town.

384
00:18:29,895 --> 00:18:31,612
Not much crime of any
to speak of.

385
00:18:31,614 --> 00:18:34,782
I'm sorry, agent.
I wish I could be more help.

386
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:36,200
Ah, that's all right.

387
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:39,119
But if you do think
of something, give me a call.

388
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,437
Will do.

389
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,468
Still hungry?

390
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:58,389
Yeah, I was just, uh...
seeing if you had any beer.

391
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:01,308
The sooner you realize
that all is good here,

392
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,394
the sooner you can go.

393
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:07,681
Don't you two have a chew toy
or something to go play with?

394
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:09,066
Hey, guys.

395
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:12,603
You mind if I grab a second
with Dean, here?

396
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:25,115
Why are you being so hard
on everyone?

397
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:26,650
Because there's no way

398
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:29,253
that all of this
is what it looks like.

399
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,170
No way.

400
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,839
Why not?
Come on, man.

401
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:34,925
I know you drank the kool-aid,
okay? But come on.

402
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:37,795
Look, amigo...

403
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:42,099
I know this is all looks nuts,
but I found it.

404
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:43,934
Love and a family?

405
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:47,304
Who cares
where that comes from?

406
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:48,472
<i>I</i> do.

407
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:50,357
I get it.

408
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,193
When I first got here,
I couldn't let go, either.

409
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:55,979
I kept waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

410
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:59,533
But when it didn't,
I had to accept the truth.

411
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:03,904
Well, I got another truth
for you --

412
00:20:03,906 --> 00:20:06,957
we were all left in the dark
when you went AWOL.

413
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:10,961
I didn't know
whether you were dead or worse.

414
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:13,047
You should have reached out
and sent someone a message.

415
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:16,083
And said what, Dean?
That I was a werewolf?

416
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:18,869
I was embarrassed.

417
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:21,371
I thought it best for everyone
if I just stayed away.

418
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:23,090
But that doesn't mean

419
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:28,395
that I didn't think about
and miss you and Sam, Kevin.

420
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:36,653
Kevin's gone.

421
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:41,275
What?

422
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:43,744
Gone for good.

423
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:45,913
What happened?

424
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:51,201
When he needed me,
I wasn't there. That's what.

425
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:56,824
Okay, Dean,
they gave you lunch,

426
00:20:56,826 --> 00:20:58,909
they gave you pie.

427
00:20:58,911 --> 00:21:02,846
Why are we still here?

428
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:04,848
Uh, yeah, you're right.

429
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,417
Yeah, Garth's good.

430
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,470
You want to hit the road,
it's square by me.

431
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:11,438
Look, I'm just saying,
this wouldn't be the first time

432
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,140
we came across
a friendly monster.

433
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:15,809
Or a-a <i>family</i>
of friendly monsters --

434
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:17,478
w-whatever this is.

435
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:25,202
Agent Perry.

436
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:26,937
Sheriff.

437
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:28,889
How can I help you?

438
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:32,126
Really?

439
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:36,163
Okay.

440
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,465
Well,
you wanted weird, agent.

441
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:57,467
You tell me
what tore up that deer.

442
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:59,820
Nothing that runs
in <i>these</i> parts.

443
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:09,479
Fresh blood.

444
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,499
Yes, it is.

445
00:22:28,775 --> 00:22:30,492
Still warm.

446
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:34,613
That means it died
after we got the call.

447
00:22:35,665 --> 00:22:38,283
Couldn't just accept
that all was good

448
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:40,285
and move on, could you?

449
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:44,573
You have no idea
what you've walked into, do you?

450
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:46,675
No matter.

451
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:48,544
You won't be walking out.

452
00:22:50,513 --> 00:22:52,347
Unh!

453
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:06,128
Hey.

454
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,096
Look at this.

455
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:09,731
I've seen that before.

456
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:11,733
Yeah, that is
a favorite accessory

457
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:13,986
of the good reverend
and his flock.

458
00:23:15,371 --> 00:23:17,239
"Ragnarok"?

459
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:20,859
Yeah, that's, uh,
Thor, Loki, Odin stuff, right?

460
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:23,278
Yeah, it's Norse mythology's
end of days.

461
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,380
But why is it
etched onto a bullet?

462
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:27,833
Who cares?
We got all the answers we need.

463
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:31,620
I don't know, Dean.
I think we need more.

464
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:34,289
Oh, what? Sheriff Andy Taylor
here wasn't good enough for you?

465
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,557
Enough to kill Garth?

466
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,310
Come on, man.
Let's do this right.

467
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:40,813
All right, fine.

468
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:42,381
Clean this up,
grab Garth,

469
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:44,183
lock him up
until we figure out what's what.

470
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:45,934
I'm gonna go
check out that church.

471
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:00,225
Garth?

472
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:35,260
Seriously?

473
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:51,693
Hey. Did you find
the lovebirds?

474
00:25:51,695 --> 00:25:53,094
No.

475
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:55,564
Place is a wreck.

476
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:57,316
No Garth, no Bess.

477
00:25:57,318 --> 00:25:59,368
What, they were taken?

478
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,536
Well,
that's fan-friggin'-tastic.

479
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:02,621
Tell me you got something.

480
00:26:02,623 --> 00:26:06,107
Well, this, uh...Ragnarok,
end-of-days crap --

481
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:07,655
star of the story
is a wolf named Fenris,

482
00:26:07,656 --> 00:26:10,741
who kills the God Odin
before the world ends.

483
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:12,442
Okay.
And that helps us how?

484
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:14,694
There are cults that
consider Fenris a wolf deity

485
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:16,029
and worship him.

486
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:18,382
They call themselves
the maw of Fenris.

487
00:26:18,384 --> 00:26:19,583
A cult of werewolves?

488
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:21,551
What do they want?

489
00:26:21,553 --> 00:26:25,555
Well, Ragnarok is not just
a Bible story to these nutjobs.

490
00:26:25,557 --> 00:26:28,975
It's an action plan --
human extinction,

491
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:31,728
total and complete
werewolf domination.

492
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,713
And...what?

493
00:26:33,715 --> 00:26:36,400
This is the -- the ground-zero
for their movement?

494
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:38,718
Freakin' Wisconsin, man.

495
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,154
Well, time for reverend Jim
to go down.

496
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,389
Yeah.

497
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:44,608
Need any help?

498
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,860
No, no, no, I got it.
You just, uh, you find Garth.

499
00:26:46,862 --> 00:26:48,028
All right.

500
00:26:50,531 --> 00:26:52,165
Unh!

501
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:20,760
It's no use, Dean.

502
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:23,596
I can hear your heartbeat.

503
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,699
You must've done this
countless times,

504
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:27,934
yet you still get nervous.

505
00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:31,788
Nothing wrong
with a little fear.

506
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,990
It's what makes us human.

507
00:27:33,992 --> 00:27:37,077
Fear is not
a purely <i>human</i> instinct.

508
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,845
Even monsters know fear.

509
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:42,415
I came to work
on my sermon.

510
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:44,301
Well, why don't you start
by preaching to me

511
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:46,303
about the maw of Fenris?

512
00:27:46,954 --> 00:27:48,121
Yeah, that's right.

513
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:51,374
I know all about you
and your pack's little plan.

514
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:54,127
I assure you,
we are planning nothing.

515
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:57,481
No? Well, then, why did I
read about it in your good book?

516
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,486
Because generations ago,

517
00:28:02,488 --> 00:28:06,406
that hate and misplaced anger
was part of our beliefs.

518
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:09,910
But ever since
I took over here,

519
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:11,945
I have eradicated it
from our congregation.

520
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:14,647
Yeah, well, apparently, some of
them didn't get the word --

521
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:17,817
like the good sheriff, who just
tried to off me and my brother.

522
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:19,953
Sheriff Pat?

523
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:22,706
Let me see your bullet.

524
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:34,667
Where is it?

525
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:36,002
Where's what?

526
00:28:36,004 --> 00:28:37,270
"Ragnarok."

527
00:28:37,272 --> 00:28:38,522
What?!

528
00:28:38,524 --> 00:28:40,357
It was etched into
the sheriff's bullet.

529
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:43,360
That's impossible.
The maw is dead.

530
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,780
Yeah, well, tell that
to Garth and your daughter,

531
00:28:46,782 --> 00:28:48,248
who are missing.

532
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:53,403
No.

533
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:00,410
Bess.

534
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:08,701
Sam.

535
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:10,036
What are you two doing?

536
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:11,671
Russ?

537
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:13,223
Joba?!

538
00:29:16,543 --> 00:29:18,378
Mom?

539
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,980
What is going on?

540
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:22,065
Hey!

541
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:24,884
First off,
I'm not your mother.

542
00:29:24,886 --> 00:29:26,853
You leave her alone!
You hear me?!

543
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:28,939
You want to hurt somebody,
you hurt <i>me!</i>

544
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:32,392
Oh, that is so sweet.

545
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:34,160
But I <i>am</i>
going to hurt her.

546
00:29:34,162 --> 00:29:36,663
And him.

547
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:39,399
But especially you,

548
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:41,868
for bringing
these hunters here.

549
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,922
I'm gonna hurt all of you.

550
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:50,961
I'm sorry.

551
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:02,229
Sam, pick up, damn it!

552
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:19,129
Unh!

553
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:20,381
Unh!

554
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,951
Please --
don't do this.

555
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:27,120
Not to Bess.
She's your daughter --

556
00:30:27,122 --> 00:30:28,121
Unh!

557
00:30:28,123 --> 00:30:30,557
How many times
do I have to say this?

558
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,626
"Stepdaughter"!

559
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:36,263
I'm the last
of my bloodline,

560
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:38,632
thanks to you and your kind
out there.

561
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:39,984
He's awake.

562
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:51,912
Well, don't you just look
good enough to eat.

563
00:30:56,785 --> 00:30:58,452
Why are you doing this?

564
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:00,754
I mean,
me, I can understand,

565
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:03,290
but these people
are your family.

566
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,692
Your pack.

567
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:13,384
Last winter,
my little brother, Charlie,

568
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:16,186
was killed by a hunter.

569
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,192
My husband counseled patience,
restraint.

570
00:31:22,194 --> 00:31:25,029
Just as when he took over
our beloved church,

571
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:27,948
he preached
a new direction --

572
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,935
lycanthropes and man
would co-exist.

573
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:37,023
Peace was more important
than dominance.

574
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:43,330
I tried so hard
to make his way work...

575
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:45,816
to be a preacher's wife.

576
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:47,668
But then...

577
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,505
Charlie was murdered.

578
00:31:51,507 --> 00:31:56,744
And I couldn't help
remembering my daddy's sermons.

579
00:31:58,163 --> 00:32:01,548
And, by golly,
turns out he was right.

580
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:07,404
As long as there is a man,
there can be no peace.

581
00:32:07,406 --> 00:32:10,657
Because man destroys.

582
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:15,579
And I, for one,
am sick of it.

583
00:32:30,044 --> 00:32:32,078
Unh!

584
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:38,435
I get it now.

585
00:32:38,437 --> 00:32:41,188
Why co-exist
when you can rule?

586
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,890
Bingo.

587
00:32:42,892 --> 00:32:45,476
But my husband
doesn't see it that way.

588
00:32:45,478 --> 00:32:50,063
See, he was bitten,
not born into it, like I was.

589
00:32:50,065 --> 00:32:52,983
He still holds on
to his humanity.

590
00:32:52,985 --> 00:32:55,452
Which is why
I am so pleased

591
00:32:55,454 --> 00:33:00,157
it will be <i>his</i> claws
that start Ragnarok, not mine.

592
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,625
You and your brother
coming here

593
00:33:01,627 --> 00:33:06,079
was a blessing
from Fenris above.

594
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:08,782
The two of you
cornered Garth here,

595
00:33:08,784 --> 00:33:10,417
and then
when Bess came running in

596
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:12,252
to see
what the fuss was about...

597
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:13,670
You killed her.

598
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:15,389
No!

599
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:17,624
Here.

600
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:19,560
Silver to the heart.

601
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:24,598
You're gonna frame
their murders on me.

602
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,235
My husband
turned his cheek <i>once.</i>

603
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:30,854
I don't think
he can do it again.

604
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,191
Hey! Get away from her!

605
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:36,360
Killing you
gives me no joy,

606
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:40,614
but Ragnarok --
it's bigger than all of us.

607
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:42,833
You're sick.

608
00:33:56,965 --> 00:34:00,184
You're just dying for me to get
my claws dirty, aren't you?

609
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:21,822
Wearing Russ' coat
to hide your scent -- smart.

610
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,208
Oh,
I'm full of surprises.

611
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:27,360
As am I.

612
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,651
Be good. Hear me?

613
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:46,837
I will.
Thanks, Sam.

614
00:35:01,553 --> 00:35:02,636
How's he doing?

615
00:35:02,638 --> 00:35:03,721
It's gonna be okay.

616
00:35:03,723 --> 00:35:05,272
He's taking it
pretty hard.

617
00:35:05,274 --> 00:35:07,791
Feels like he should have
seen the signs earlier.

618
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:11,495
Yeah, well,
maybe you were right.

619
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:14,982
Yeah, he seems like
a good man...considering.

620
00:35:14,984 --> 00:35:16,867
Yeah.
And <i>you</i> were right.

621
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:20,037
Everything around here
<i>wasn't</i> copacetic.

622
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,705
I screwed up again.

623
00:35:21,707 --> 00:35:23,857
First Kevin, now this.

624
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:26,193
Hey. Kevin?

625
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:27,745
That's on <i>me.</i>

626
00:35:27,747 --> 00:35:30,864
I'm the one
that pulled him into all this.

627
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:35,335
I'm the one that should've
been there to protect him.

628
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:37,704
Well...

629
00:35:37,706 --> 00:35:40,724
I guess there's enough of
that blame to go around, then.

630
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:45,846
Dean.

631
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:46,764
Yeah?

632
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:48,649
Um...

633
00:35:48,651 --> 00:35:50,984
I know this may sound
a little crazy, but...

634
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:53,320
Maybe I could come back
and hunt with you.

635
00:35:53,322 --> 00:35:56,857
I mean, with my werewolf mojo,
we'd have an advantage.

636
00:35:56,859 --> 00:35:59,026
Yeah, look, Garth --

637
00:35:59,028 --> 00:36:00,411
No, Dean.

638
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:03,497
I want to make this right.

639
00:36:03,499 --> 00:36:06,133
I never should've left you guys,
especially Kevin.

640
00:36:06,135 --> 00:36:08,902
Kevin was my friend.

641
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:11,355
Friends don't do that.

642
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:16,677
Well, hey, you said it --

643
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,962
you know, who cares
where happiness comes from?

644
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:23,133
Look, we're all a little weird,
we're all a little wacky --

645
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:24,101
some more than others --

646
00:36:24,103 --> 00:36:27,604
but...if it works,
it works.

647
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:29,072
You got something here.

648
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:31,424
Okay? Even though
they <i>are</i> werewolves.

649
00:36:32,944 --> 00:36:34,978
Lycanthropes -- whatever.

650
00:36:36,147 --> 00:36:37,931
Don't let that go.

651
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:39,149
Okay?

652
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:42,102
You'll never
forgive yourself.

653
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:44,788
Besides, somebody's got to live
to tell this damn story someday,

654
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,523
and who better than you?

655
00:36:48,626 --> 00:36:50,828
Now shut up
and come here.

656
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:53,831
Really?

657
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,550
Hurry up
before I change my mind.

658
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:25,279
I'll send you
that postcard.

659
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:26,813
Yeah.

660
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:35,088
Hey.

661
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:47,384
Uh, listen,
that night that, uh...

662
00:37:47,386 --> 00:37:49,186
You know, we went our --
our separate ways --

663
00:37:49,188 --> 00:37:51,188
you mean
the night you split?

664
00:37:53,975 --> 00:37:55,726
Fair enough.

665
00:37:57,395 --> 00:37:59,129
I was messed up, man.

666
00:38:00,131 --> 00:38:03,133
Kevin was dead,
and I...

667
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:06,787
I don't know what I was.

668
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:11,909
Okay.

669
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:16,480
Hell,
maybe I <i>still</i> don't.

670
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:20,717
But, uh...

671
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,753
I know I took a piece of you
in the process,

672
00:38:22,755 --> 00:38:24,805
and for that...

673
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:31,395
Somebody changed the playbook,
man, you know?

674
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:33,546
It's like what -- what --
what's right is wrong

675
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:36,984
and what's wrong
is <i>more</i> wrong, and...

676
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,222
I just know that when...

677
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:44,741
When we rode together...

678
00:38:44,743 --> 00:38:46,827
We split the crappiness.

679
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,380
Yeah.

680
00:38:50,382 --> 00:38:52,432
So...

681
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:01,258
Okay.

682
00:39:03,294 --> 00:39:04,544
Okay.

683
00:39:04,546 --> 00:39:06,913
But something's broken here,
Dean.

684
00:39:08,016 --> 00:39:11,218
I'm not saying
that it's not. I...

685
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,387
I just think maybe we need
to put a couple W's on the board

686
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:14,771
and we get past all this.

687
00:39:14,773 --> 00:39:16,607
I don't think so.

688
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:19,192
No, I-I wish, but...

689
00:39:20,812 --> 00:39:25,449
We don't...see things
the same way anymore --

690
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:28,402
our roles
in this whole thing.

691
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:31,154
Back in that church,

692
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:35,242
talking me out of
boarding up hell?

693
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:40,447
Or -- or tricking me into
letting Gadreel possess me?

694
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:44,751
I can't trust you --
not the way I thought I could,

695
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:46,920
not the way
I should be able to.

696
00:39:50,675 --> 00:39:53,310
Okay, look.

697
00:39:53,312 --> 00:39:56,813
Whatever happened...

698
00:39:56,815 --> 00:39:58,882
We are family, okay?

699
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:02,986
You say that
like it's some sort of cure-all,

700
00:40:02,988 --> 00:40:05,072
like it can change
the fact

701
00:40:05,074 --> 00:40:08,575
that everything that has
ever gone wrong between us

702
00:40:08,577 --> 00:40:10,661
has been
because we're family.

703
00:40:10,663 --> 00:40:13,363
So, what --
we're not family now?

704
00:40:13,365 --> 00:40:15,615
I'm saying,
you want to work?

705
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:17,534
Let's work.

706
00:40:17,536 --> 00:40:20,754
If you want
to be brothers...

707
00:40:25,543 --> 00:40:27,444
Those are my terms.
