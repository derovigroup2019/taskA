1
00:00:01,757 --> 00:00:03,448
Reverend Buddy Boyle's
"Goin' For Glory Hour."

2
00:00:03,473 --> 00:00:05,473
<i>When angels come a-knocking,</i>
<i>let 'em on in.</i>

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:09,135
Angles can't possess a human
without permission, right?

4
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:10,419
Yep.
So, what?

5
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:11,970
They're using this guy
to find vessels?

6
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:12,971
It's a willing audience.

7
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:14,423
Who put Crowley in charge?

8
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:16,675
He's the king.
He's a salesman.

9
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:22,047
Right now you and I are gonna
talk about a regime change.

10
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:23,765
You're ours.

11
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:27,519
Your demon ass is going to be
a mortal ass pretty damn quick.

12
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:33,742
Where do I start
to even look for forgiveness?

13
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:38,230
How 'bout we start with this?

14
00:00:38,232 --> 00:00:40,065
You're human?

15
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:41,566
Zeke?

16
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:42,618
Castiel cannot stay here.

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,536
He will bring the angels
down on all of us.

18
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:45,487
He's warded.

19
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:46,922
He was warded
when April found him.

20
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:47,923
Castiel is in danger.

21
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:50,425
And if he is here,
I am in danger.

22
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:51,276
Wait, you're in danger?

23
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:53,078
If he stays,

24
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,047
I am afraid I will
have no choice but to leave.

25
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:56,298
Cass, can we talk?

26
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,799
You can't stay.

27
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:07,476
Sir?

28
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:08,944
Sir, can you hear me?

29
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:11,480
Please --
please just say something.

30
00:01:11,482 --> 00:01:12,614
Are you still there?

31
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:14,983
Keep talking,
and I can help you through this.

32
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:18,737
Please, sir, if you can hear me,
stay on the phone.

33
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,656
It may feel hopeless right now,

34
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:22,241
but you called the hotline
for a reason.

35
00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:24,159
There's some part of you
that still wants to live --

36
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:26,945
some part that knows suici--

37
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:09,021
Who are you?

38
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:11,957
Did the lady from the hotline
send you?

39
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,209
No.

40
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:17,012
You did.

43
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,032
I know, and that play
in the second quarter?

44
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,084
I mean, what team
is he playing for?

45
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:57,702
Not ours.

46
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:06,895
High-five!

47
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,570
Morning, Steve.
Bill.

48
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:16,738
High...

49
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,224
Five.

50
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,065
Sorry I'm late.

51
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,368
I had to drop the baby off
at daycare,

52
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,503
then hit every red light
on the way here,

53
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:34,206
but guess
I shouldn't have worried.

54
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,791
Place looks great.

55
00:03:35,793 --> 00:03:36,758
Coffee urns.

56
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,576
Uh, full.
Dairy case.

57
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:39,544
Stocked.

58
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:40,746
Okay, Steve,
last question --

59
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:42,798
where have you been
all my life?

60
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:46,584
You're not like
the other sales associates.

61
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:49,438
There's...something different
about you.

62
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,356
I can assure you
there's -- there's not.

63
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,191
I know these things.

64
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:55,894
You're...

65
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:58,530
Mm. You're special.

66
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,111
That's your "big news""

67
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:15,547
is that you translated
the tablet into...

68
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:16,631
Doodles?

69
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,000
It's cuneiform.

70
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:21,803
I-I hit a wall translating
the tablet into English.

71
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,638
But I found
an ancient codex

72
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,591
linking the Angel script
to proto-Elamite cuneiform,

73
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:28,260
and I was able
to translate the tablet

74
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:31,346
and the footnotes
into Elamite, which is --

75
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:32,280
Doodles.

76
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:33,648
It's extinct.

77
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,300
Well,
can you read it?

78
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:36,284
No one can.

79
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:38,153
Scholars have tried
for centuries.

80
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:40,439
So it's a dead end?

81
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:41,639
N-not quite.

82
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:45,477
Now, most proto-Elamite
is abstract,

83
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:46,644
but I was able
to decipher

84
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:48,530
one phrase
from Metatron's footnotes.

85
00:04:48,532 --> 00:04:49,865
"Falling angels."

86
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:55,820
Okay, so, the footnotes
refer to Metatron's spell?

87
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:58,490
Maybe.

88
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:01,009
Okay.

89
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:03,512
Well, maybe if we can
decipher the footnotes,

90
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:05,330
then we can
reverse the spell and...

91
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:08,133
Punt those winged dicks
back to heaven.

92
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:09,384
Where do we start?

93
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:12,270
Research.

94
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:13,671
We comb through
the library,

95
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:16,007
see if we can find
anything else on Elamite.

96
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:22,230
"Zimmerman's encyclopedia
of extinct languages volume 1:

97
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:25,066
Adai to Atakapa."

98
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:26,785
How many volumes
are there?

99
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:27,903
24.

100
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:31,206
Don't worry,
we've got them all.

101
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,291
Awesome.

102
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:39,197
There is a God.

103
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,366
Hello.

104
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:42,834
I may have a case for you.

105
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:45,504
Four missing
in Rexford, Idaho.

106
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:46,638
Presumed dead,

107
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,424
but no bodies have been released
to loved ones.

108
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:50,759
And there were reports

109
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:53,144
of a strange substance
at the scenes.

110
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:54,996
Oh, well,
hello to you too, Cass.

111
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:55,997
How are you?

112
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:58,600
I...am busy.

113
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:01,386
All right. So, how do you
want to do this?

114
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:02,474
You want to meet up at
the latest scene?

115
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:04,240
You want me to pick you up?
What?

116
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:09,094
Um, I've got my hands full
over here.

117
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:10,512
I just -- um...

118
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:11,913
Cass? Hello?

119
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:13,949
...thought you would want
to know about the case.

120
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,585
Hey, are you sure
everything's --

121
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:19,754
Okay.

122
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:21,739
So, he said nothing
about where he is

123
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,341
or -- or
what he's been doing?

124
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:24,576
This is Cass.

125
00:06:24,578 --> 00:06:26,211
In case you forgot,
he's not exactly chatty Cathy.

126
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:27,963
And you're not even gonna
see him when you're in Idaho?

127
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:30,715
Well, like I said, as long as
he's catnip for angels,

128
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:32,017
he's keeping his distance.

129
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,420
So -- then what's
the point, Dean?

130
00:06:35,422 --> 00:06:36,888
I mean,
it's barely even a case.

131
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,424
That's why I'm just gonna
go have a little look-see,

132
00:06:39,426 --> 00:06:41,476
and we're not gonna waste
a whole lot of manpower

133
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:42,811
on a big pile of nada.

134
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:45,530
In other words, a perfect excuse
to bail out on research.

135
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:48,283
You got me.

136
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:52,621
Hey, Steve?

137
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:54,906
I found this
in the supply closet.

138
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:56,374
Do you know whose it is?

139
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,209
Um...

140
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:01,913
That's mine.

141
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:03,665
Thanks.

142
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:09,204
I also found
a rolled-up sleeping bag

143
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:10,689
behind the tool locker.

144
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:14,009
Yes, I wanted to be thorough
with inventory,

145
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:16,261
so I worked late
last week,

146
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:20,599
and taking a nap here was easier
than going back home to my bed.

147
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:22,800
Which I-I have, of course --

148
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:24,436
a bed...and a home.

149
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:25,520
Wow, Steve.

150
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:27,689
You're so...

151
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:30,141
responsible.

152
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,411
I've been afraid to ask.

153
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:37,982
I-I don't want to take advantage
of you as my employee,

154
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:40,318
and I certainly don't
want to jeopardize

155
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,886
our working
relationship.

156
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:43,505
But as a working
single mom,

157
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:45,957
it's hard enough
to get a date,

158
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,260
let alone
meet a really great guy.

159
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:52,514
And tomorrow's my night off,
and I know you're off, too,

160
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:56,167
and I was just wondering
if there's any chance you're...

161
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:58,303
free tomorrow night?

162
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:00,472
Um...

163
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:01,839
Yes?

164
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:05,026
Yes.

165
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,396
You're the best!

166
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,627
So, uh, four missing?

167
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,081
Four dead.
Just got confirmation.

168
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:30,051
And, uh, any common threads
you can think of?

169
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:31,869
Well, Joe in there

170
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:34,589
had the suicide hotline
on speed dial.

171
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:37,642
The gal before him
was a shut-in.

172
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:40,011
Had enough antidepressants
in her medicine cabinet

173
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:41,229
to stock a pharmacy.

174
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:42,430
The first victims --

175
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:44,449
a married couple
out of Sugar City.

176
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:47,318
Pretty much a walking billboard
for no-fault divorce.

177
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,070
Were they all basket cases?

178
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:52,724
If you asked me to make a list
of this county's saddest sacks,

179
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,526
these four would've been
right on top.

180
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,945
All right, so,
four unhappy people,

181
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:58,413
one of them
definitely suicidal.

182
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:00,949
But you've
ruled out suicide?

183
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:05,003
You're gonna
want to put these on.

184
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:22,971
This look like suicide to you?

185
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,425
Blood?

186
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:30,278
If the tests come back
same as the others,

187
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,475
it's everything.

188
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,650
Blood, skin, hair, nails.
Internal organs.

189
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,034
Even clothing fibers --

190
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:37,168
like these poor souls

191
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,537
got run through
the world's finest wood-chipper.

192
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:41,139
What about witnesses?

193
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:42,373
Same as the rest.

194
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,710
Neighbors reported
some kind of a pink flash.

195
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:48,630
By the time we got here,
all that was left was...

196
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:49,798
this.

197
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:55,553
Yeah, we're almost
through the texts over here.

198
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:56,805
We got nothing.

199
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,256
Have you tried
Professor Morrison?

200
00:09:58,258 --> 00:09:59,307
Yeah, he's unreachable.

201
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:00,842
He took a sabbatical

202
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:04,679
to live amongst the Trobrianders
of Papua New Guinea.

203
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:06,798
Needless to say,
we're pretty burnt.

204
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,816
Well,
there's one guy there

205
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:09,501
who is nothing
notifl-rested.

206
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:11,152
Crowley?
I'm just saying.

207
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:13,254
We're not keeping him chained up
for the one-liners.

208
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:14,405
It's worth a shot,
I guess.

209
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:15,690
Just be careful,
all right?

210
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:17,141
Don't fall for any of his
"quid pro quo" crap.

211
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:18,109
Noted.

212
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:19,127
So, what about you?

213
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:20,912
How's Cass' lead
panning out?

214
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,781
Four victims
suddenly exploded.

215
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:23,981
I tried EMF.

216
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:26,451
I've looked for hex bags,
sulfur -- nada.

217
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:27,735
Spontaneous combustion?

218
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:28,787
Maybe the Thules?

219
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:30,238
No, no, no. I already
ruled them out.

220
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,674
The bodies were vaporized.
They weren't burned.

221
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:33,991
That sounds
like a real case.

222
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:35,210
Dean,
I should be there.

223
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:37,929
No, man. That's -- that's
uh...not necessary.

224
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,597
No, I, uh --

225
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:42,133
I got this one covered.

226
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:52,727
He dumped me, Jace.

227
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:54,345
In the cafeteria.

228
00:10:54,347 --> 00:10:55,613
In front of everyone.

229
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,066
It's just like...
Who does that, you know?

230
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:00,568
Like, why couldn't he
just dump me on Facebook

231
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,188
like a normal person?

232
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,324
I've been destroyed.

233
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:09,577
Socially and romantically
totaled.

234
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:16,117
I know.
Just so embarrassed, Jace.

235
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:18,052
I could just die.

236
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,991
I can help with that.

237
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:24,559
What?

238
00:11:33,315 --> 00:11:35,199
Thanks.

239
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:42,048
Good day, ma'am.

240
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,067
And good luck!

241
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:50,390
I'll have some beef jerky
and a pack of menthols.

242
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:52,192
What are you doing here?

243
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:54,161
Gee, it's nice
to see you, too, Cass.

244
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:56,246
It's Steve now.

245
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,416
And...you --
you surprised me.

246
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,667
Well, the feeling is mutual.

247
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,936
I mean, I knew you had to
lay low from the angel threat,

248
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:04,955
but, uh, wow!
This is some cover.

249
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:09,576
My Grace is gone.

250
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:10,844
What did you expect?

251
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:13,213
Do you have any idea
how hard it was?

252
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:16,249
When I fell to earth,
I didn't just lose my powers.

253
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:17,267
I --

254
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:21,605
I had nothing.

255
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,307
Now...

256
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,025
I'm a sales associate.

257
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:27,611
A sales associate?
Hey, Steve. Sign here?

258
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,151
I'm responsible for inventory,
sales, customer service.

259
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,536
I keep this place --

260
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:36,603
thank you --
thank you.

261
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:37,905
Clean and presentable.

262
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:41,158
And when my manager's busy,
I even prepare the food.

263
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,777
Wow.

264
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:46,964
So you went from fighting
heavenly battles

265
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,633
to nuking taquitos?

266
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:52,469
Nachos too.

267
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:56,306
I've been politely asking
for reading material for weeks,

268
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,058
and this is
what you bring me?

269
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:02,646
Pass.

270
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,566
Can you read Elamite
or not?

271
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:08,835
It's by no means my favorite
of the ancient tongues,

272
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:09,820
but yes.

273
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,438
Will you help us read it?

274
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,974
Why on earth would I?

275
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:16,142
Because I was there
that night.

276
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:18,745
I saw what humanity
did to you.

277
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:22,049
Like it or not,
there's a little part of you

278
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,483
that's not a douche.

279
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:25,369
Sorry, moose.

280
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,954
To the last drop.

281
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:36,179
Crowley, the only reason
you're alive

282
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:38,315
is because my brother
thought you would be useful.

283
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,834
So far,
you've done Jack.

284
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:46,356
Back to plan "B," I guess.

285
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,891
Which is?

286
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,394
Give you up to Abaddon.

287
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,363
You think you can
threaten me with that hack?!

288
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:57,017
She's all fury,
no finesse.

289
00:13:57,869 --> 00:13:59,269
I'm not so sure.

290
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,122
Our last encounter with Abaddon,
she was, uh --

291
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:04,725
she was pretty terrifying.

292
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:08,211
Scarier than you've been
in years.

293
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:09,796
Bring that to me.

294
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,908
This is not you, man.
You are above this.

295
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,942
Come on.

296
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,744
No, Dean.

297
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,729
I'm not.

298
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,248
I failed
at being an angel.

299
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,902
Everything I ever attempted
came out wrong.

300
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:53,040
But here, at least I have a shot
at getting things right.

301
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:54,925
I guess
you can't see it,

302
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,178
but there's a real dignity
in what I do --

303
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,346
a human dignity.

304
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:01,131
Hate to interrupt
you guys, but, Steve?

305
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,966
Customer had an accident
in the men's room.

306
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,435
I'm on it.

307
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,436
Oh, and tonight --

308
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,221
7:00 at my place
work for you?

309
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:09,856
Great.

310
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:13,026
You're the best!

311
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:17,364
That's what
this is about!

312
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:18,315
What?

313
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,317
The girl.

314
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,320
No, Dean.
It's not.

315
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,822
Nora --

316
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,207
she's a very nice woman,

317
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,794
I'm pretty sure she's not
a reaper intent on killing me,

318
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,113
and she's asked me out.

319
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:34,081
Going on dates --

320
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,465
that's something
humans do, right?

321
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,500
Yeah. I mean,
my dates usually end

322
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,834
when I run out
of singles,

323
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:38,835
but, uh, yeah.

324
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,721
Yeah, that's something
that humans do.

325
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:48,595
This is Agent Lee Ermey.

326
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,263
I'll be right there.

327
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,065
There was another kill --
over at the high school.

328
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,100
You comin'?

329
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:54,267
I wouldn't be much use.

330
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:55,402
I don't have my powers.

331
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:56,937
So?
I've never had powers.

332
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,905
You are a hunter.

333
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:01,074
And you're a hunter
in training, remember?

334
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:02,075
Yeah, I remember.

335
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:03,276
You said I sucked.

336
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,411
I didn't say that.

337
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:06,312
I said that there was, uh,
uh, you know,

338
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:07,447
"room for improvement."

339
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:08,749
Come on.

340
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,334
All right, my shift's over
in five minutes,

341
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,086
and my date's
not until later, so...

342
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:14,287
Attaboy!

343
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,372
I'll go get the car.

344
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,007
Not just yet.

345
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,844
I have to clean
the bathroom.

346
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:53,910
One second we're talking,

347
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:57,831
and the next, she just...stops.

348
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,667
And then everyone
in the cafeteria freaks,

349
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:03,587
rushing and pointing
out the window, at --

350
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:10,393
Could -- could that
really be her?

351
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,181
And nobody saw anybody else
at the scene --

352
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:16,983
a man, woman,
anything unusual?

353
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,154
Your friend,
was she, uh, depressed?

354
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:22,322
Depressed?

355
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:24,241
Any thoughts of suicide?

356
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,744
Ew. No.

357
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,664
I mean,
she was kind of bummed

358
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,732
that dick-bag Travis
broke up with her

359
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:34,201
in front of the whole school.

360
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:35,235
Kind of bummed?

361
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:36,569
Yeah.

362
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:40,207
Like more bummed than when
she got a "C" on a quiz,

363
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,741
and...

364
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:43,710
less bummed
than when her parents split up.

365
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:46,579
Kind of...bummed.

366
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,358
Excuse me.

367
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:05,815
Cass, what's wrong?

368
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,870
I've seen this before.

369
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:11,705
What? Where?

370
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:13,406
In heaven.

371
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:15,992
What, you're saying
an angel did this?

372
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,794
It's no ordinary angel.

373
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:21,798
Dean, this is bad.

374
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,466
This is very bad.

375
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:34,648
On the battlefields
of Heaven,

376
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:39,101
there was a special class
of angel, the Rit Zien.

377
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:41,136
It's Enochian
for "Hands of Mercy."

378
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:42,971
They functioned
like medics.

379
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:44,023
They tended to the wounded.

380
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,807
They healed those
who could be healed,

381
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:48,911
but for the mortally wounded,
those who were past saving,

382
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:51,247
the Rit Zien's job
was to put them down.

383
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:52,698
But the granulated bodies?

384
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,301
This was
their special ability.

385
00:18:55,303 --> 00:18:59,421
They had this way of smiting
that was so quick and so total

386
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:01,357
that it rendered death
virtually painless.

387
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,958
Yeah, but these
aren't wounded angels

388
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,926
that they're vaporizing,

389
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:04,927
they're people.

390
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:07,513
Right.
I don't know.

391
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:13,352
The Rit Zien home in on pain,
it's like a beacon to them.

392
00:19:13,354 --> 00:19:15,938
So, when this angel
fell to earth,

393
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,108
he heard the victims' cries,
their anguish,

394
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,161
same as he'd hear an angel's
in heaven.

395
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,813
He's continuing
his heavenly work down here.

396
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,732
One suffering human
at a time.

397
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,434
Yeah, but this last victim
was not suffering.

398
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:30,402
She was just a normal,
moody kid.

399
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:31,487
But he just got here.

400
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:34,540
The ebb and flow
of human emotion --

401
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:38,327
Dean, I've been on earth
for a few years,

402
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:40,095
and I've only begun
to grasp it.

403
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,915
To him,
pain is pain.

404
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,850
So everybody's fair game?

405
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:49,421
All right, well,
we got to stop him.

406
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,490
You have to stop him.

407
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:57,763
You're scared.

408
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:01,784
It's different now, Dean.
Everything feels different.

409
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:06,221
You're right.

410
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:09,575
All right, I'll track down
this, uh, Kevorkian wannabe,

411
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:11,059
and I'll put him down.

412
00:20:12,696 --> 00:20:14,163
Okay.

413
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,331
You stay safe.

414
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,232
Go on that date,
all right?

415
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:19,451
Go live a normal life.

416
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,872
Okay.

417
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,014
Well?

418
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,984
I need a ride.

419
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:39,621
Right.

420
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,982
I'll do it.

421
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:53,085
But I want something in return.

422
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:54,503
Yeah, what's that?

423
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,155
A telephone call.

424
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:02,611
Come on, moose.

425
00:21:02,613 --> 00:21:05,297
Even Dahmer
got one telephone call.

426
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,232
Seriously?

427
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:09,385
You want to let Crowley
communicate with Abaddon?

428
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:12,588
A king and a power-mad knight
of hell isn't enough for you?

429
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,640
Want to throw a demonic team-up
into the mix?

430
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:15,641
I don't think so.

431
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:17,976
I mean,
I don't trust Crowley, either.

432
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:20,896
But I can't honestly see him
working with Abaddon.

433
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:22,164
He hates her too much.

434
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,483
You said it.
You can't trust him.

435
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:25,601
We don't have to.

436
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:27,152
Look, Crowley's bound.

437
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:28,970
We can end the call
whenever we want.

438
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:31,640
Even if he wanted
to give Abaddon information,

439
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:32,708
he has none
to give her.

440
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,942
He doesn't even know
where the bunker is.

441
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:36,695
He says he can decrypt
the translation?

442
00:21:38,114 --> 00:21:40,199
What if he's lying?

443
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:43,102
You're right.

444
00:21:44,654 --> 00:21:46,672
We're gonna need proof.

445
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:50,709
What are these?

446
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:51,927
Ingredients.

447
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:53,512
More specific.

448
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:57,516
Ingredients for a spell.

449
00:22:04,474 --> 00:22:05,974
Heart of a Nephilim.

450
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:06,992
Cupid's bow.

451
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,510
Grace of an angel.

452
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,847
And the rest of them.

453
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:15,534
Phone call.

454
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:19,488
You'll get the rest
when I get paid.

455
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:26,695
Now, who's gonna be a dear
and open up a vein?

456
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:35,721
Okay.

457
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:37,539
Thanks, Dean.

458
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:39,842
Cass.

459
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:42,294
Wait.

460
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:46,231
I can't let you
do this.

461
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:47,232
What?

462
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:50,569
You're gonna wear that
on a date?

463
00:22:51,654 --> 00:22:53,372
This is all I have, Dean.

464
00:22:53,374 --> 00:22:56,742
Okay.
Uh, lose the vest.

465
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,110
What are you --
Lose the vest.

466
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:00,662
Come on.

467
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:03,699
That's a little better.
All right.

468
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:05,784
There we go.
All right.

469
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,068
And now your buttons --

470
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,087
why don't you
unbutton it?

471
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:10,255
Okay.

472
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:12,240
Th-that's far enough,
Tony Manero.

473
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:15,794
Um...

474
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:17,913
Yeah. Good. All right.

475
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:19,248
Listen to me.

476
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,216
Always open the door
for her, okay?

477
00:23:21,218 --> 00:23:23,101
Ask a lot of
questions.

478
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:24,386
They like that.

479
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:28,256
And, uh...oh, if she says
she's happy to go Dutch,

480
00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:29,257
she's lying.

481
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:31,760
All right?

482
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:34,446
Go get 'em, tiger.

483
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,607
Nice touch.

484
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:31,286
What are you doing,
jackass?

485
00:24:33,957 --> 00:24:36,308
Hey!

486
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:53,675
Steve!
I'm so glad you're here.

487
00:24:53,677 --> 00:24:55,176
Come in.

488
00:24:58,314 --> 00:25:00,115
I thought
I was gonna be late!

489
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:01,199
Late for what?

490
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:02,150
My date.

491
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:04,152
Bowling,
would you believe it?

492
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:06,989
But damned if I'm not
dressing fancy,

493
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:08,240
even for bowling.

494
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:11,827
Haven't had an excuse
to doll up since Tanya was born.

495
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:14,880
And there she is,
my little angel.

496
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:16,364
Now,
she's already been fed,

497
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:18,433
she'll probably sleep
the whole time,

498
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,335
and I'll only be gone
a couple of hours.

499
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:22,254
I just couldn't get
my usual sitter,

500
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:24,973
and I needed somebody here
just in case she wakes up

501
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:27,509
and starts crying,
which she won't, I promise.

502
00:25:27,511 --> 00:25:29,344
Baby Tanya never cries.

503
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:31,647
Wish me luck.

504
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:38,219
Oh, and thank you.
You really are the best.

505
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,415
Babysitting.

506
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:01,376
A-bup-bup-bup.

507
00:26:01,378 --> 00:26:02,577
What?

508
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:05,047
Not yours. His.

509
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:07,382
What difference
does it make?

510
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:09,601
I've had yours.

511
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:11,136
Stuck in here,

512
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:14,106
you can't fault me
for wanting a little variety.

513
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:15,023
No way!

514
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:17,442
What's wrong,
Short Round?

515
00:26:17,444 --> 00:26:18,527
Afraid of needles?

516
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:22,531
No, I just have a policy
of not giving blood

517
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:24,316
to anyone
who's murdered my mother.

518
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:28,870
I have nothing
but time.

519
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:32,574
You're a dick.

520
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,610
Good luck
with that translation.

521
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,116
<i>Inferni sectatores,</i>
<i>nunc audite regem.</i>

522
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:17,619
This is Crowley.

523
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:20,138
Connect me to --

524
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,808
Crowley.

525
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,793
Bad connection.

526
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:31,216
Crowley.
Your king.

527
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:34,002
If you don't connect me
to Abaddon right away,

528
00:27:34,004 --> 00:27:37,139
I will be forced to --

529
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:38,457
What? What happened?

530
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:42,194
I've been placed on hold.

531
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:47,499
Hello?

532
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,867
Um...

533
00:27:51,354 --> 00:27:54,456
Please -- please don't.

534
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,418
Okay.

535
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,805
Okay, okay.
How 'bout --

536
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:11,473
how 'bout a lullaby?

537
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:12,641
Um...

538
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:15,477
Okay. Shh. Shh!

539
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:19,481
? Look at what's happenin'
to me ?

540
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:23,718
? I can't believe it myself

541
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,107
? suddenly I'm up on top
of the world ?

542
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:33,862
? it should've been
somebody else ?

543
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:36,531
? oh, believe it or not

544
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:39,034
? I'm walkin' on air

545
00:28:39,036 --> 00:28:43,404
? I never thought
I would feel so free-e-e ?

546
00:28:43,406 --> 00:28:48,210
? flyin' away
on a wing and a prayer ?

547
00:28:48,212 --> 00:28:51,513
? who could it be?

548
00:28:51,515 --> 00:28:56,434
? Believe it or not,
it's just me ?

549
00:28:56,436 --> 00:29:01,640
? believe it or not,
it's just me ?

550
00:29:01,642 --> 00:29:02,941
Shh.

551
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,780
I know, I know.

552
00:29:11,768 --> 00:29:13,401
Sheriff?

553
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:14,936
Now, here's a wrinkle.

554
00:29:14,938 --> 00:29:16,872
Our first crime scene,
married couple?

555
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:20,458
Full analysis of the spray
came in from the lab.

556
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,161
Turns out it only contains
the wife's DNA.

557
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:28,083
The husband's
still out there.

558
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:31,439
Nobody told you.
Nobody explained.

559
00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:36,675
You're just shoved out

560
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:40,061
kicking and screaming
into this human life,

561
00:29:40,063 --> 00:29:44,816
without any idea why any of it
feels the way it feels,

562
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:49,237
or why this confusion,
which feels like

563
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:55,310
it's a hair's breadth
from terror or pain.

564
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,413
You know, just when
you think you do understand,

565
00:29:58,415 --> 00:30:00,832
it'll turn out you're wrong.

566
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:03,001
You didn't
understand anything at all.

567
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:05,870
Guess that's just how it is
when you're new at this.

568
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:09,908
You know,
it wasn't that long ago

569
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,295
when all I'd need to do to
ease your pain was touch you.

570
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:19,500
You're very warm.

571
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:21,052
Is that normal?

572
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:26,441
Oh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

573
00:30:26,443 --> 00:30:29,811
He was already a bit screwy,
but then he found religion.

574
00:30:29,813 --> 00:30:32,680
She was a hard-line atheist,
no peach herself.

575
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:36,284
When he got himself obsessed
with this Buddy Boyle whack job,

576
00:30:36,286 --> 00:30:38,453
an already bad marriage
got worse.

577
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:40,405
Kept telling her
to "Let God in."

578
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:42,407
Buddy Boyle.
That explains it.

579
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:43,408
Explains what?

580
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:47,579
Never mind.
Let's see.

581
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:51,299
Is that his truck?

582
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:52,533
Yep.

583
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:57,138
Cass.

584
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,641
Nora, she's hot.
She's really hot.

585
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:02,543
Please just call -- call me.
Call -- call back.

586
00:31:02,545 --> 00:31:06,381
If I don't hear back,
I'm taking her to the hospital.

587
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:23,448
Okay, Tanya,
we're taking a little walk.

588
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,674
Hello, Castiel.

589
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,691
Squalid little dump.

590
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,609
No wonder she cries.

591
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:47,663
It's a fever, Ephraim.
It will pass.

592
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:49,665
You remember my name?

593
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:52,084
I was just a nobody
when we met,

594
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:55,087
but you --
you were a legend.

595
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:57,473
You've been here before.

596
00:31:57,475 --> 00:32:00,710
This is my first time,
and it's...

597
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,011
Intense.

598
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:03,429
You know, there's a lot
you don't understand

599
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:05,965
about humanity
at first.

600
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,467
If you would just stop --

601
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,936
Stop?

602
00:32:09,938 --> 00:32:11,854
I won't stop

603
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:15,191
until I wash the planet clean
of all suffering.

604
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:20,146
Allow me.

605
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,901
Don't...touch...her.

606
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:28,054
You think I came for her?

607
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:32,508
No, Castiel.
I came for you.

608
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:38,915
How long's it take to transfer
a demonic phone call?

609
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,566
Can it, moose.

610
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:45,054
Crowley, you got your call.
Yeah, it's time.

611
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,723
It's time when I bloody well
say it's time!

612
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:50,009
Hello, Abaddon.

613
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:53,712
Crowley,
how in the hell are you?

614
00:32:56,066 --> 00:33:00,553
So much pain and despair,

615
00:33:00,555 --> 00:33:03,506
so many voices
begging out for relief.

616
00:33:03,508 --> 00:33:05,224
How'd you find me?

617
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:08,444
Because you're warded?

618
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:11,781
The same way
I find all my patients --

619
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:14,634
I just followed
the sound of your pain.

620
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:19,038
You have no idea
how loud it is.

621
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,091
I could hear you
for miles.

622
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:24,827
Do you really think you're doing
Heaven's work down here?

623
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:26,128
I know I am.

624
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,380
You're wrong.

625
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:30,433
Earth can be a hard place.

626
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:32,751
But these humans,
they can get better.

627
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:35,054
They're just doing
the best they can.

628
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,523
Is that what you think
you're doing, Castiel --

629
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:39,108
the best you can?

630
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,560
Well, I'm sorry.

631
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:44,213
But if this is the best
that the famed Castiel can do,

632
00:33:44,215 --> 00:33:46,699
you're a more urgent case
than I thought.

633
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:49,318
I used to admire you.

634
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,238
You failed more often
than you succeeded.

635
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,773
But at least
you played big.

636
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:04,450
Now what are you doing?

637
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:06,802
Burying your head
in the sand.

638
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:10,256
Right when your kind
needs you the most.

639
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,392
How are the numbers?

640
00:34:13,394 --> 00:34:15,428
You mean souls?

641
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,964
I've managed to double
on your projections.

642
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:21,800
Now, how did I ever
pull off such a feat?

643
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:24,654
You're taking souls
before their time.

644
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,741
Voiding my contracts.

645
00:34:28,743 --> 00:34:29,942
That's right.

646
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:33,913
I'm taking it all down,
brick by brick.

647
00:34:33,915 --> 00:34:35,247
It's over.

648
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:39,985
The days of Crowley, the king
of bureaucrats, are done.

649
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:45,157
Shhh.
It'll be over soon.

650
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,525
I'll take the pain away.

651
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:47,827
I want to live.

652
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:53,299
But as what, Castiel?
As an angel or a man?

653
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,475
You...

654
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:03,693
Ganky...

655
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:05,394
Putrescent...

656
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:06,445
Skanger.

657
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:08,447
It may look like
bean-counting to you,

658
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:10,349
it may lack a certain
adolescent flair,

659
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:13,069
but my way...
Works!

660
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:19,125
You think you can control Hell
with chaos alone,

661
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:23,429
without the support of those
who are still loyal to me?!

662
00:35:23,431 --> 00:35:25,748
No one's seen you in weeks,
and last I saw you,

663
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,753
Howdy and Doody had you tied up
nice and tight.

664
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:35,424
Seems to reason, they've
turned you into a kennel dog.

665
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:37,309
How does it feel, Crowley,

666
00:35:37,311 --> 00:35:39,261
to be the Winchesters' bitch?

667
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:42,181
It's been fun
indulging in your bluffs,

668
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:46,569
but we both know
you have no real authority left,

669
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:50,106
no leverage,
you have nothing to offer me.

670
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,241
You have nothing.

671
00:35:52,243 --> 00:35:55,194
Your way will backfire.

672
00:35:57,164 --> 00:36:01,367
You will burn.

673
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:04,754
I can't wait.

674
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,884
Crowley?

675
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:20,919
Bring me the translations.

676
00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:26,442
I keep my agreements.

677
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:45,944
"Obtain the ingredients --
heart, bow, Grace."

678
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:47,112
Blah, blah, blah.

679
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:50,282
"Mix until the smoke
shall rise from the ashes

680
00:36:50,284 --> 00:36:52,951
casting the angels
from heaven."

681
00:36:52,953 --> 00:36:56,122
Blah, blah -- oh.

682
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:57,556
Hm.

683
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:01,477
It's irreversible.

684
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,015
What?

685
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:08,934
The spell can't be undone.

686
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:12,137
The new world order --

687
00:37:12,139 --> 00:37:14,490
we're stuck with it.

688
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:19,528
You say you want to live.

689
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:23,816
But you can't see
what I see.

690
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:27,019
By choosing a human life,
you've already given up.

691
00:37:27,987 --> 00:37:30,823
You chose death.

692
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:53,284
Well, there's no way.
Crowley's lying.

693
00:37:53,285 --> 00:37:55,935
No, Dean,
not this time.

694
00:37:56,062 --> 00:37:57,995
Look, Metatron
built the spell

695
00:37:57,997 --> 00:38:00,331
to withstand any attempt
to reverse it.

696
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:02,699
There is no putting the angels
back in Heaven.

697
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:03,901
It's done.

698
00:38:06,655 --> 00:38:08,389
Are you gonna tell Cass?

699
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,239
I'm, uh,
sorry I overreacted.

700
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,823
My friend gave me a tip.

701
00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:22,377
A low dose of acetaminophen
brought the fever right down.

702
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:26,831
Oh, that's okay.
Date was a bust anyway.

703
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:34,205
Steve?

704
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:36,674
The part of you
that overreacted,

705
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:39,377
that cares so much?

706
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:42,880
That's what
makes you special.

707
00:38:55,577 --> 00:38:58,746
I got to go.

708
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:07,638
Where to, Cass?

709
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:15,373
Listen, Cass,
back at the bunker,

710
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,859
I, uh...

711
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:19,827
Sorry I told you to go.

712
00:40:22,147 --> 00:40:25,249
I know it's been hard on you,
you know, on your own.

713
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:26,834
Somehow you're adapting.

714
00:40:26,836 --> 00:40:29,670
I'm proud of you.

715
00:40:29,672 --> 00:40:32,123
Thank you, Dean.

716
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:40,498
But there's something
Ephraim said.

00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,350
The angels --
they need help.

718
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:44,435
Can I really
sit this out?

719
00:40:44,437 --> 00:40:46,804
Shouldn't I be searching
for a way to get them home?

720
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:49,557
Me and Sam, we'll take care
of the angels.

721
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:53,528
You're human now.

722
00:40:55,347 --> 00:40:57,582
It's not
your problem anymore.
