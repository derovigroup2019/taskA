1
00:00:01,962 --> 00:00:03,956
What kind of thing
likes virgins and gold?

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:04,914
Dragons

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,190
Dragons, dude.

4
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:08,526
Oh! No!

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,145
I just think it's better
if you took it easy,

6
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:13,314
you know,
and didn't act like you were --

7
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:14,365
possessed by an angel.

8
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:16,200
I believe
you know Sheriff Mills.

9
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:17,835
That was not my son!
You're right.

10
00:00:17,837 --> 00:00:19,537
No!
How do we put them down?

11
00:00:20,724 --> 00:00:21,839
What are we drinking?

12
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,908
You have less than one minute

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,427
before a very dear friend
of yours snuffs it.

14
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,379
Call it off, Crowley.

15
00:00:29,582 --> 00:00:30,548
I saw you break down,
Crowley.

16
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,749
When I was trying
to cure you,

17
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:33,351
I know
a part of you was human again,

18
00:00:33,353 --> 00:00:35,703
maybe still is.
Blah-blah. Boo-hoo.

19
00:00:57,576 --> 00:00:59,777
Nighty-night, Slim.

20
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:28,272
Aah!

00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:45,099
Hey.
Hey.

24
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:46,851
You okay?
Yeah.

25
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:48,269
Uh

26
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:50,438
Yeah.

27
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,891
Just, uh...resting my head
for a second.

28
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:55,610
Um, how's Kevin?

29
00:02:55,612 --> 00:02:58,746
He, uh --
he find anything?

30
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:00,364
Uh, Jack.

31
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:02,783
On about four days
no sleep.

32
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:03,751
He looks worse than you.

33
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:07,388
Huh.
What about Crowley?

34
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,126
Um, do you think he might be
lying about the whole, uh,

35
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:14,595
"Metatron's spell being
irreversible" thing?

36
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:15,746
Oh, Crowley lie?

37
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:19,851
I do know one thing.

38
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:22,053
Next time that junkie's jonesing
for a hit of blood,

39
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:23,771
we got leverage.

40
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:27,074
Seriously,
you want a pillow?

41
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:28,059
No, I'm fine.

42
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,260
You're sick.

43
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:30,778
No, I'm not sick.

44
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,813
I'm just, um --

45
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:34,699
I feel like
my battery can't recharge.

46
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:44,792
Hello?

47
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:46,327
Hey, Dean.
Jody Mills.

48
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,245
Sheriff Mills.

49
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:49,297
Hang on.
Sam's here, too.

50
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,383
Hey, Jody.
Hey, Sam.

51
00:03:52,385 --> 00:03:56,003
Uh...I got a bit of an oddball
to pitch your direction.

52
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:56,954
Shoot.

53
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:00,141
A small town I cover
outside of Sioux Falls --

54
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:03,477
only crime to speak of being
the occasional cow tipping.

55
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,630
Then last week,
four people go missing.

56
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:08,599
All right, so, what makes you
think this is our kind of weird?

57
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:09,934
I've got
a witness who says

58
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:14,572
he saw someone lift an S.U.V.
to nab a girl last night.

59
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:31,923
Sheriff.

60
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,841
Laying off the blind dates,
I hope.

61
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:35,009
Yeah.

62
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:36,427
You bite your tongue,
boy.

63
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:38,796
Hey.

64
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:40,848
So?

65
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,966
So.

66
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:44,268
Car was right over there,
ass over teakettle.

67
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,971
Now, normally,
if somebody would tell me

68
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:48,339
that one guy lifted
an S.U.V.,

69
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,341
I'd tell him to take
a flying leap,

70
00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:52,176
but after
what I've seen...

71
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:53,778
Nothing's impossible.
Uh-huh.

72
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,147
And this matches up
with the other missing how?

73
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:57,348
Well, four abductions,

74
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,116
strong evidence left
at every scene -- literally.

75
00:04:59,118 --> 00:05:00,851
So,
first vic was a pastor?

76
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:01,852
Yeah.

77
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:03,287
Door of his study
was punched in.

78
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,706
And then, the next two --
an engaged couple.

79
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,491
Locked bedroom window
was ripped open.

80
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:08,442
Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,428
And then
we have our waitress here

82
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,696
with the topsy-turvy ride.

83
00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:13,848
Any other connection
among them?

84
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,082
Yeah.

85
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:17,885
They were all members
of Good Faith church here.

86
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:20,921
My, uh, my church group
back in Sioux Falls

87
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:22,206
was in a tizzy over it.

88
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,540
Hmm.

89
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:24,575
What?

90
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:27,044
I didn't peg you
for churchy.

91
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:28,846
Yeah.

92
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:29,880
You know...

93
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,565
Choking
on the ladies' room floor

94
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:32,716
'cause of witchcraft

95
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:34,652
kind of makes a higher power
seem relevant.

96
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:38,506
Jody, are you sure you're, uh,
to jump back in the fray?

97
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:40,941
This wackadoo stuff
keeps coming.

98
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:43,727
More I know,
better armed I'll be.

99
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,580
Okay,
so, we have, uh,

100
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:48,899
missing church folk
and super strength.

101
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:50,668
Maybe angels harvesting
vessels?

102
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,203
Could be
a Buddy Boyle type thing.

103
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:53,587
Wh-- angels?

104
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:54,672
You're joking.

105
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:56,290
Don't get your pants on fire.
They suck.

106
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,542
You said
there was a witness.

107
00:05:58,544 --> 00:06:01,379
Yeah, well...
more or less.

108
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:04,432
Okay, Slim.

109
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:07,885
My friends here want to talk
to you about the missing girl.

110
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:10,438
Honor.

111
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,772
Her name was Honor.

112
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:13,340
Nice girl.

113
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:15,893
Always left me
meatloafs.

114
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:17,144
Mm.

115
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:19,397
Slim, why don't you tell us
what you saw that night?

116
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,584
I heard a big noise,
got woke,

117
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:27,738
and there's somebody over there
lifting a car up --

118
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,541
like this.

119
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:33,577
And did you happen to see
who it was?

120
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:34,829
I was too far.

121
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:37,448
But I saw a light go off.

122
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,499
A white light?

123
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:39,750
Blue.

124
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:42,219
Blue like fire.

125
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:43,170
But not.

126
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:48,726
Then she was --
she wasn't there.

127
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:50,928
Could you think
of anything else?

128
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,948
No.

129
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,132
Okay.

130
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:59,270
Well...Slim,
thank you for your time.

131
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:09,497
Okay.
So, no white light.

132
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:10,664
No angel.

133
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,316
Has anybody talked
to the victims' families?

134
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:13,984
It's next on my list.
Okay, and you said

135
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:15,536
that they were all part
of the same church?

136
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:16,820
Mm-hmm.

137
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:19,006
Ready to get
your worship on?

138
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:23,794
We hope you enjoyed the tour.

139
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:27,264
Any questions before we get
you boys registered?

140
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,683
Uh, yeah,
uh, look, um,

141
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:30,801
Ms. Futchko --

142
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:31,802
oh, please...

143
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:33,387
Bonnie will do just fine.

144
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,472
Bonnie.

145
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:38,476
Okay, um, we...
love the church. We do.

146
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,344
But...

147
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:43,898
Well, we've heard that a few
members have gone missing,

148
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,816
and, to be honest...

149
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:48,619
...that kind of scares us.

150
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:53,224
Let me assure you,
with our increased security,

151
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:55,659
good faith
has never been safer.

152
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:58,262
And those people
who have gone missing,

153
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:00,998
well, they are front and center
in our prayers.

154
00:08:02,134 --> 00:08:03,217
What a relief.

155
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:06,520
Now, you must have been,
uh, close to them.

156
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:10,040
Well, we do share
the A.P.U. bond.

157
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:11,308
"The A.P.U."?

158
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,061
Our chastity group,
abstinence purifies us.

159
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:16,046
Oh.

160
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:17,264
W-wow.

161
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:19,517
You mind if we sit in on that,
maybe see if it's for us?

162
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,152
I'm afraid
it's members only.

163
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:24,555
I'm sorry,
but it can get pretty personal.

164
00:08:24,557 --> 00:08:26,240
Then count us in.

165
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:32,563
Well.

166
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:33,864
I'll be a squirrel
in a skirt.

167
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:36,867
I'll be back in a jiff
with the papers.

168
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:45,543
A chastity group?

169
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:47,077
Dean, listen, if all the members
were in A.P.U.,

170
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,430
then maybe whatever took them
is stalking virgins.

171
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:51,048
And that Slim guy said
he thought he saw fire.

172
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,299
So, what are you thinking,
dragons?

173
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:54,134
Mm. Shh.

174
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,752
All righty.

175
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:59,089
You can just sign there,
and your purification can begin.

176
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:04,478
"Purity pledge"?

177
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,430
It's a commitment
to your virginity.

178
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:10,868
I don't think we can
really un-ring that bell.

179
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:13,153
You know what I mean?

180
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:20,878
Oh.

181
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,879
I see.

182
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:23,964
Well...

183
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:27,051
If you just ask
for God's forgiveness

184
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:30,671
for your sins
and make a new vow of chastity,

185
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:33,957
well, then, you'll be born again
as a virgin in his eyes.

186
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,478
So, you just hit
the "virginity do-over" button,

187
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,812
and all is good with the man
upstairs?

188
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:41,932
It's not a button.

189
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:45,569
And...this isn't
just a piece of paper.

190
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:49,073
I mean,
this is your clean slate,

191
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:51,742
your chance to be a virgin
until marriage.

192
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:55,029
Well,
you had me at "clean slate""

193
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:56,447
Let's do this.

194
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:06,924
Congratulations,
Sam and Dean Winchester.

195
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:09,326
You are both virgins.

196
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:11,828
Ah.

197
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,084
Please.

198
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,253
Stay away from me.

199
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,862
Good afternoon, everyone.

200
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:34,914
I'm Suzy.

201
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,783
I thought we'd begin
with a silent prayer

202
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:39,317
for our missing friends.

203
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:53,715
Amen.

204
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:58,169
Now, does anyone have anything
that they would like to share?

205
00:11:58,171 --> 00:12:00,439
I wrote
a new piece of verse.

206
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:04,643
It's called
"Sex is a racket,

207
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:06,278
and God's ball
is in your court."

208
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,782
And we would love to hear that,
Tammy -- later.

209
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:15,687
Why don't we hear
from our new friends?

210
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:19,190
Sam, what brought you here
to reclaim your virginity?

211
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:24,963
Well,
I guess because every woman

212
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:29,801
I've...ever...
had relations with,

213
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:34,306
uh...it...hasn't
ended well.

214
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,224
He ain't lying.

215
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:38,543
Thank you for being here,
Sam.

216
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:40,595
Stay strong.
Stay pure.

217
00:12:40,597 --> 00:12:43,515
Stay strong.
Stay pure.

218
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:45,934
And you, Dean?

219
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:48,236
What set you on the path
away from sin?

220
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:52,891
Uh, hard to say,
exactly.

221
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:54,526
Yeah.

222
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:58,380
Sex has always felt --

223
00:12:58,382 --> 00:13:00,999
I don't know --
good, you know?

224
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:03,835
I mean,
really, really good.

225
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:08,790
Uh...But, uh...

226
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:12,093
Sometimes, it just
makes you feel bad, you know?

227
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:14,095
You're drunk.

228
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:15,597
You shack up.

229
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,349
Then,
it's the whole morning thing.

230
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:19,017
You know,
"Hey, that was fun."

231
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,854
And then,
"adios," you know?

232
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,255
Always the "adios."

233
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:26,224
But, you know,
when you get down to it,

234
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:27,559
what's the big deal,
right?

235
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:29,811
I mean, sure,
there's the touching

236
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:32,147
and the feeling
all of each other,

237
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:37,235
my hands everywhere,
tracing every inch of her body,

238
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:43,241
the two of us moving together,
pressing and pulling...

239
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:44,709
Grinding.

240
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:48,079
Then you hit
that sweet spot,

241
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:52,083
and everything just builds
and builds and builds

242
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:54,002
until it all just...

243
00:13:58,123 --> 00:13:59,624
Yeah.

244
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:01,092
Uh...

245
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:04,729
But the whole thing was
just a little too, uh...sticky.

246
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:08,183
So, uh,
I got my "V" card back.

247
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:10,802
The end.

248
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:14,656
Hm.

249
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:17,576
So, um...

250
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:19,477
Wee bit of an over-share,
Dean?

251
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,662
I was purifying.

252
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:24,148
Hey,
she look familiar to you?

253
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:28,870
Suzy?
Yeah.

254
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:30,288
Swear I know her
from somewhere.

255
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,206
Oh, good, Dean.

256
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,959
'Cause that line
never fails.

257
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:35,210
Well, let's find out.

258
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:39,998
Hey.
So?

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,716
So?

260
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:43,351
How did you like
the meeting?

261
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:46,037
Oh,
I-I-I-I loved it.

262
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,022
Yeah.

263
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:48,223
Um, you know,

264
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:51,359
I-I couldn't help but think
of those who weren't here.

265
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:54,529
Oh.

266
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:56,214
Honor.

267
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:57,482
She's my favorite.

268
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,991
Would you excuse me?

269
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,463
Her favorite?

270
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:14,549
She has no idea
what kind of girl Honor is.

271
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:16,584
You don't say.

272
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:18,720
Uh, Tammy, right?
The poet?

273
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:19,871
Mm-hmm.
Tammy, why --

274
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:21,589
why don't, um,
why don't you tell me

275
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,558
what kind of girl Honor is?

276
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,209
Are you sure
we don't know each other?

277
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:27,562
Yeah, I-I'm pretty sure
we've never met, Dean.

278
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:28,730
Hmm.

279
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:30,348
Wait, you're --
you're new in town, right?

280
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,382
Uh, yeah.

281
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:32,434
New to town.

282
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:34,185
New to this whole
chastity thing.

283
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:35,937
Well, I provide
individual counseling.

284
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:37,072
If you ever need to talk --

285
00:15:37,074 --> 00:15:39,724
so, everybody in the group,
they dish to you?

286
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:40,825
They confide.

287
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:42,393
Abstinence is --

288
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:47,749
it's really rough
without support and education.

289
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:49,000
Hey, you know what?

290
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:51,369
I have some great books
on the vow

291
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:52,737
that really helped me.

292
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:53,838
I-I live close.
I'll just go grab them.

293
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,923
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

294
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:56,875
With a, uh,
with a kidnapper on the loose?

295
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,343
No, I'll be fine.

296
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:00,078
Tell you what --
why don't I walk with you

297
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,179
just to be safe, okay?

298
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:03,631
Just give me one second.

299
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:06,551
And I bake real cookies
for the bake sale.

300
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:07,719
Honor just brings Oreos!

301
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:09,921
Oh. You know what?
Excuse me.

302
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:13,975
Guess who's taking
the teacher home.

303
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:15,593
Research.

304
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:17,812
You really think
you're gonna hit that?

305
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:19,898
Dean,
she's the chastity counselor.

306
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,149
Yeah, I know.

307
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:22,600
What about you?
Any luck?

308
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:23,785
You mean
am I actually working?

309
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:25,070
As a matter of fact,
yes, I am.

310
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:26,988
All right, well,
good luck with that.

311
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,908
Okay.
Lead the way.

312
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,910
Okay.

313
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:38,449
Hey.

314
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:41,086
Sorry.
So, where were we?

315
00:16:41,088 --> 00:16:43,755
Honor is going to hell.

316
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:51,012
Hey.

317
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:53,231
How was church?

318
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:55,850
Well, it turned
into confessional.

319
00:16:55,852 --> 00:16:58,603
Apparently,
two of our vics,

320
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:01,856
Honor and pastor Fred,
did the dirty.

321
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,609
Oh, well.
They're not the only ones.

322
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,811
Barb Blanton,
our missing bride to be --

323
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:07,829
Yeah?

324
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:10,582
Her mom said she heard
Barb and her fianc?

325
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:11,983
in Barb's bedroom.

326
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:13,418
Going at it?

327
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,038
Well, she said she heard
sex noises, then Barb crying,

328
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,673
then Neil telling Barb
it didn't count

329
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:20,158
because it was
under 30 seconds.

330
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,546
And then, two hours later,

331
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:26,781
she heard a smash
and saw a flash of light

332
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,799
under the door.

333
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,684
Blue light?

334
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:31,770
You know, I'm thinking
whatever this thing is,

335
00:17:31,772 --> 00:17:35,440
it's not going after virgins,
even born-again virgins.

336
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,942
It's taking virgins
who break their chastity vow.

337
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:41,179
So dragons are
off the list.

338
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:43,731
I'm sor-- dragons?

339
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:46,317
Those are a thing?

340
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,318
Yeah.

341
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,070
Too many things
are things.

342
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,300
Make yourself comfortable.

343
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:27,775
Not now, Kato.

344
00:18:48,315 --> 00:18:51,599
I can't stop thinking
about my friends.

345
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:55,803
I'm so scared for them.

346
00:18:55,805 --> 00:18:58,106
Will you pray with me,
Dean?

347
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,728
Sure.

348
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:19,160
<i>This is Dean's other</i>
<i>other cell,</i>

349
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:21,729
<i>so you must know</i>
<i>what to do.</i>

350
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:23,965
Dean.

351
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:26,634
Come on, call me.

352
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,006
You know,
for being born again today,

353
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,274
you sure look like crap.

354
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:39,063
Wait a second.

355
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:41,232
Did you...get --

356
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:42,183
Born again?

357
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,918
Yeah.
Oh, Sam.

358
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,605
I don't make promises
I can't keep.

359
00:19:49,742 --> 00:19:51,743
It's just...

360
00:19:51,745 --> 00:19:54,779
I enjoy church.

361
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:56,731
I mean, after...

362
00:19:56,733 --> 00:20:00,952
after Bobby,
Crowley...

363
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:05,990
...I needed something
that made sense to me --

364
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:07,658
you know, comfort,
I guess.

365
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,362
Yeah, I guess
we're all looking for that.

366
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:13,731
Except those that got it.

367
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:16,801
Come on.

368
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:18,236
You and Dean?

369
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:20,238
That's something special,
don't you think?

370
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:43,527
Okay.

371
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:45,380
So, why don't you
breeze through these,

372
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:47,799
and I'm gonna head
to the little girls' room.

373
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:49,867
Mm, yeah.

374
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:07,402
Hey.

375
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:08,903
Dean?

376
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:11,656
Hey, Dean.
Are you there?

377
00:21:11,658 --> 00:21:14,359
Hello?

378
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:16,661
Dean?

379
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:18,363
Dean?

380
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:19,914
Sammy! Hey.

381
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,116
What's going on?

382
00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:23,567
I found something big.

383
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:24,568
Yeah. So did we.

384
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,920
So, get this --
it's not a dragon.

385
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:27,905
Uh-huh. Uh-- ooh.

386
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:29,627
Dean.
Copy that.

387
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:38,132
Hey.

388
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:40,101
Or should I say...

389
00:21:40,103 --> 00:21:42,053
<i>"Hola"?</i>

390
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:44,772
Uh, why?

391
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:46,708
No reason.
No reason.

392
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:49,160
A-are you okay?

393
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:50,762
Me? Ah --

394
00:21:50,764 --> 00:21:53,131
I'm great. Why?

395
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:56,934
Uh, you seem...
I-I don't know, nervous.

396
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:58,436
Nervous? No.

397
00:21:58,438 --> 00:22:02,206
I'm not nervous...
Carmelita.

398
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:11,449
So, you've seen my...
work.

399
00:22:14,303 --> 00:22:15,336
Listen, I don't blame you

400
00:22:15,338 --> 00:22:16,921
if you want to be assigned
a new counselor.

401
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:17,922
I-I get it.

402
00:22:17,924 --> 00:22:19,090
No. No, no.

403
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:22,060
Are you --
are you kidding me?

404
00:22:22,062 --> 00:22:23,928
I mean, you're --
you're a freaking legend.

405
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,896
No!

406
00:22:24,898 --> 00:22:26,931
I-I am --
I'm not that girl anymore.

407
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:29,517
I moved here.
I changed my name.

408
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,970
That girl was --
was horrible.

409
00:22:32,972 --> 00:22:37,909
Listen, uh, Suzy,
I've seen a lot of awful things,

410
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:39,911
stuff of nightmares,
okay?

411
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:44,866
But you --
you're the good dreams.

412
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:49,670
And nobody
in Hartford knows?

413
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,205
Yeah,
what am I supposed to say?

414
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:53,207
"Oh, yeah, hey,
I used to be a porn star.

415
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,325
Let's pray"?

416
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:57,378
Well...

417
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,130
They do not appreciate you.

418
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:06,120
I mean...
the things you can do --

419
00:23:06,122 --> 00:23:08,639
the scene with the tacos.

420
00:23:08,641 --> 00:23:11,309
Yeah.

421
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:12,944
Made me want to join
a mariachi band

422
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:15,396
just to be near you.

423
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:19,817
Well, you are now.

424
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,404
I am, aren't I?

425
00:23:23,406 --> 00:23:29,193
You're not like...
the other guys in town, are you?

426
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:33,164
You're kind of a...
a bad boy.

427
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,966
I don't know.

428
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:37,802
Why don't you ask me that
in Spanish?

429
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:42,673
?Eres un Chico malo?

430
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:45,259
<i>S?.</i>

431
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,087
? <i>Ol?</i> ?

432
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:05,513
Aah!

433
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:35,227
Oh.

434
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:37,979
Pastor Fred.

435
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:40,431
Aah!

436
00:24:42,486 --> 00:24:44,453
Neil? Barb?

437
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,771
What was that?

438
00:24:46,773 --> 00:24:47,906
What happened to him?

439
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:50,041
What do you think?
He's starving to death.

440
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:51,943
Just like we will
if we don't get out of here.

441
00:24:51,945 --> 00:24:53,545
Why didn't you tell me
who you were?

442
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:54,880
I was so scared.

443
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:56,381
<i>We</i> were scared.

444
00:25:24,911 --> 00:25:27,145
Aah.

445
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:39,291
Where'd he go?

446
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:47,432
What's up?

447
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:49,334
This thing is taking people
that break their vows, right?

448
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:50,302
Yeah.

449
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:52,971
Dean and Suzy --
been over an hour.

450
00:25:52,973 --> 00:25:55,774
Right.

451
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:03,365
I got to say...
I <i>really</i> missed that.

452
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:05,734
I miss it already.

453
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:14,743
Okay.

454
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:45,914
What are you doing?

455
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:48,198
I'm so thirsty.

456
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,801
So thirsty!

457
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:55,756
There has to be
a way out!

458
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,824
Hey. Dean.

459
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:05,793
Dean. Hey, come on.

460
00:28:05,795 --> 00:28:07,628
Dean. Dean.

461
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:15,302
Where are we?

462
00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:17,921
Hell.

463
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,013
Hey.
Hey.

464
00:28:26,015 --> 00:28:27,130
Neighbors see anything?

465
00:28:27,132 --> 00:28:28,098
Flash of blue.

466
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,766
Huh.

467
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:31,435
You sure
Dean was here?

468
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:32,903
Oh, yeah.

469
00:28:32,905 --> 00:28:34,738
And I think he crossed someone
off his bucket list.

470
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,196
We tried.
There's no escape.

471
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:46,867
Are we gonna
run out of air?

472
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:48,702
I don't think so.

473
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:51,121
Somebody wants us to die
nice and slow.

474
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:53,390
And then it's gonna
take us,

475
00:28:53,392 --> 00:28:55,108
just like it took
pastor Fred.

476
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,210
What took him?

477
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,262
We couldn't see,
exactly.

478
00:28:58,264 --> 00:29:00,230
It --
it was so bright.

479
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:03,667
I-it was like
it was on fire.

480
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:04,852
Hey.

481
00:29:04,854 --> 00:29:08,105
Virgins, fire --

482
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:10,807
sound familiar?

483
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:13,193
"Vesta,
Roman Goddess of the Hearth""

484
00:29:13,195 --> 00:29:15,011
in ancient Rome,

485
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:17,314
six virgins were dedicated
to this chick every year.

486
00:29:17,316 --> 00:29:20,484
Their main duty was
to tend Vesta's hearth.

487
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:22,786
Wait, so, fire is connected
to virginity?

488
00:29:22,788 --> 00:29:24,204
Yeah,
the girls had to be pure

489
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:25,939
because fire is the symbol
of purity.

490
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:27,574
Huh.

491
00:29:27,576 --> 00:29:29,543
Okay, as long as Vesta's fire
was kept lit,

492
00:29:29,545 --> 00:29:31,528
Rome received
a good harvest.

493
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,581
The virgins had to stay celibate
for 30 years.

494
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,634
If they broke their vows,
they were buried alive.

495
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:41,037
Son of a bitch.

496
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:47,227
Dean.

497
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:49,763
Maybe God wants us
down here --

498
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:52,349
because of what we did.

499
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:56,353
Trust me --
this is not God's work.

500
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:58,939
Son of a --

501
00:29:58,941 --> 00:30:00,157
What's wrong?

502
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,075
They took my phone.

503
00:30:03,895 --> 00:30:06,997
Luckily...

504
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:10,000
I keep a spare.

505
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:14,070
Come on, bars.

506
00:30:21,412 --> 00:30:25,549
Vesta was often enveloped
in a blue halo of light,

507
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:29,436
which she could control at will
to disorient, to maim --

508
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:30,520
ohh --

509
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:31,722
or to kill.

510
00:30:31,724 --> 00:30:33,974
Okay, what about
some way to kill her?

511
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:35,859
A-a weapon or --
or something.

512
00:30:39,698 --> 00:30:41,281
Dean?
Sam! Sammy!

513
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:42,532
Dean.
Hey.

514
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:45,035
Hey, listen to me. I'm --

515
00:30:45,037 --> 00:30:46,320
Dean, wh--
underground.

516
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:47,287
Say it again.
I can't hear you.

517
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:48,655
We're --

518
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:49,773
Some kind of --

519
00:30:49,775 --> 00:30:50,940
Dean!

520
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:54,544
I lost him.

521
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:56,296
What?
Listen, is there

522
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:58,248
some kind of train station
around here or something?

523
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,783
I-I could have sworn
I heard a whistle.

524
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:05,589
Don't, Neil.
Please, don't.

525
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:07,123
Shh. Shh.

526
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,909
Don't what, Neil?

527
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:10,394
Just mind your beeswax,
pal.

528
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,565
Hey. Hey!

529
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:17,133
Listen, we're all stuck
down here together.

530
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:18,635
So, you got something to say,
you say it.

531
00:31:18,637 --> 00:31:22,289
Okay, look, whatever
that fireball thing was,

532
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,191
it's taking the weakest,
and I am not gonna be next.

533
00:31:24,193 --> 00:31:26,660
So, the way I see it,
her leg's busted anyway.

534
00:31:26,662 --> 00:31:29,145
We serve her up.
It could buy us some time.

535
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:30,313
Screw you, Neil.

536
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:33,450
Busted leg?

537
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:34,751
Try a sprained ankle,
okay?

538
00:31:34,753 --> 00:31:36,386
Nobody's serving
anybody up!

539
00:31:36,388 --> 00:31:40,657
We are under the gallows,
all of us.

540
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:41,591
Give it honor.

541
00:31:41,593 --> 00:31:43,827
It might save
the rest of our necks,

542
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,479
unless you have
a better plan.

543
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:47,597
Maybe I do.

544
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,665
Maybe we'll give him <i>you.</i>

545
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:51,351
Oh, what,
you don't like that idea?

546
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:53,670
Then shut up.

547
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:02,345
Here we go. 8:00 p.m. train
out of Sioux Falls.

548
00:32:02,347 --> 00:32:04,264
79 miles an hour.

549
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:06,650
What's five miles east
of Hartford -- anything?

550
00:32:06,652 --> 00:32:09,202
Uh...

551
00:32:09,204 --> 00:32:10,787
Pasture mostly.

552
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:12,656
No --
the old Wimmer farm.

553
00:32:13,658 --> 00:32:16,376
Wait,
anything on a weapon?

554
00:32:16,378 --> 00:32:18,929
Oak stained
in virgin blood.

555
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:20,363
Where are we gonna get
a virgin?

556
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:21,364
I'm a virgin.

557
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:24,200
I think we need
the real McCoy here, Sam.

558
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:25,919
You need what?

559
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:27,938
Your blood.
Just a dab.

560
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,006
But...
Pagans use blood.

561
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:31,224
Are you pagans?

562
00:32:31,226 --> 00:32:32,209
What? Pagan?

563
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:33,393
No, look,
it's for a weapon that --

564
00:32:33,395 --> 00:32:36,045
You are
in a House of God.

565
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:37,898
Your psycho rituals
aren't gonna fly here.

566
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,982
Okay, we don't have time
for this.

567
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:40,734

568
00:32:40,736 --> 00:32:42,051
I'm calling the cops.

569
00:32:42,988 --> 00:32:44,521
I <i>am</i> the cops.

570
00:32:47,658 --> 00:32:49,493
What the fudge, lady?!

571
00:32:49,495 --> 00:32:50,877
Wipe your nose, dear.

572
00:33:07,712 --> 00:33:09,129
Jody.

573
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:45,449
You broke, too, huh?

574
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:48,001
Guess I'm not as strong
as I thought I was.

575
00:34:14,278 --> 00:34:15,328
God forgives.

576
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,448
You told me that
yourself.

577
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:22,986
Told you.
It's back for one of us.

578
00:34:22,988 --> 00:34:24,087
What are you
gonna do now?

579
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:25,172
Right, you should have
listened to me --

580
00:34:25,174 --> 00:34:27,757
Shh! Shut up.

581
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:29,492
Jody!

582
00:34:29,494 --> 00:34:30,794
Sam?

583
00:34:30,796 --> 00:34:32,462
Dean!
We're here!

584
00:34:32,464 --> 00:34:33,630
We're gonna
get you out!

585
00:34:33,632 --> 00:34:35,048
Jody, I found it!

586
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,499
Sammy? Sammy!

587
00:34:40,672 --> 00:34:42,305
Sammy!
Hey, Dean, we're here.

588
00:34:42,307 --> 00:34:43,807
We're gonna
get you out.

589
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,114
Sammy,
are you still there?!

590
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:53,182
Sam!

591
00:34:57,622 --> 00:34:59,456
Now, now.

592
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:04,511
Shh.

593
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,299
Really?
This is how a goddess acts?

594
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:20,851
What?

595
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,569
I'm sort of new to this,
but, you know,

596
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:26,323
a Roman deity burying people
alive in a barn?

597
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:27,941
Sort of pathetic,
don't you think?

598
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:29,609
It only got pathetic

599
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:31,644
when I started
having to do it myself.

600
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,817
Because of that hippie
from Bethlehem --

601
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:42,622
before him, they practically
threw virgins at me.

602
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:43,957
And now --

603
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,825
they let your fire go out.
They forgot about you.

604
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:47,327
Yeah, I know.

605
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:49,162
Sucks to be Lindsay Lohan,
doesn't it?

606
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:55,101
Actually, I figured

607
00:35:55,103 --> 00:35:58,021
if you can't beat them,
join them.

608
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:01,975
That's right.

609
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:05,478
I adapted!

610
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,199
Now I chew on the cud of prayer.

611
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,650
Heck...

612
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:13,620
I even got a sweater set.

613
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:25,698
Screwdriver, anybody?

614
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,223
Hey.

615
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:35,759
From the first-aid kit.

616
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,350
Aah!

617
00:36:43,352 --> 00:36:46,319
They used to beg
to stay pure for me.

618
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:51,324
And now I have to drag them
kicking and screaming.

619
00:36:51,326 --> 00:36:54,911
And they're not even
real virgins.

620
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:56,329
They're born-again.

621
00:36:57,698 --> 00:36:59,666
You want
to talk about pathetic?

622
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:01,534
Yeah.
You're a real charity case.

623
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:04,004
Oh, no, sweetheart.

624
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:05,372
This isn't charity.

625
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:07,740
I take what I deserve.

626
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:14,598
When those trollops
are about to die

627
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:20,687
soaked in their juicy fear,
I...eat...their...livers!

628
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,224
Because that's the only part
of them

629
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:27,677
still working to purify
the body that they've trashed.

630
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,981
Now, normally,
I like them weaker,

631
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:34,434
but let's just call this
a hunter's exception, shall we?

632
00:37:34,436 --> 00:37:35,619
Sure.

633
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:40,206
This is
how a goddess acts!

634
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,585
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

635
00:37:57,591 --> 00:37:58,591
Aah!

636
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:01,961
Aah!

637
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:03,963
What's wrong with you?

638
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,966
What?

639
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,151
Your liver.

640
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:11,671
It's -- it's no good.

641
00:38:11,673 --> 00:38:16,359
Dear boy, you're all duct tape
and safety pins inside.

642
00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:19,079
How are you alive?

643
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:40,266
What did I miss?

644
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:52,472
Aah.

645
00:38:52,474 --> 00:38:53,706
Heading out?
Yeah.

646
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,174
I'd tell you boys
to stay out of trouble,

647
00:38:55,176 --> 00:38:56,709
but what's the point?

648
00:38:58,846 --> 00:38:59,679
Ow.

649
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:02,398
Thanks
for bailing me out.

650
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,216
Oh, what can I say?
I'm getting the hang of this.

651
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,268
Drive safe.

652
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,486
Thanks.

653
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:10,823
Don't get the door for me
or anything.

654
00:39:21,252 --> 00:39:24,453
What's up?

655
00:39:24,455 --> 00:39:26,556
What if there is
something wrong with me --

656
00:39:26,558 --> 00:39:30,042
something...really wrong?

657
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:32,461
You're just crapped out,
man.

658
00:39:32,463 --> 00:39:33,513
You need some rest.

659
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:34,847
Oh, it's more than that.

660
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:37,800
I mean, Vesta said I was
practically dead inside.

661
00:39:37,802 --> 00:39:39,519
Oh, and she's
in the circle of trust now?

662
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:41,020
Why would she lie?

663
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,273
It's probably the trials,
okay?

664
00:39:44,275 --> 00:39:47,426
Probably some sort of a,
you know, aftereffect.

665
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,761
It's not like you're
bouncing back from the flu here.

666
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:50,897
I mean, you were glowing
with freaking trial juice.

667
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:53,533
I don't know.

668
00:39:53,535 --> 00:39:54,567
Well,
what else would it be?

669
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:56,485
Why does it have to be
something else?

670
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:58,271
It's always something else.

671
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,923
We're always scraping to find
some other explanation

672
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:03,025
when maybe it is...
just me.

673
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:03,943
Oh, come on, Sam.

674
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:05,578
I'm a mess, Dean.
You know it.

675
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,446
And sometimes,
I feel like

676
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:11,150
maybe I'm never gonna
actually be all right.

677
00:40:11,152 --> 00:40:13,786
You will.

678
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:16,923
All right, 'cause whatever
it is, we'll figure it out.

679
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:21,010
Or this is...

680
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:22,461
just the way I am.

681
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:29,001
I can't.

682
00:40:29,003 --> 00:40:33,672
I can't let you
put this on yourself.

683
00:40:35,276 --> 00:40:37,443
Listen to me.

684
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,497
It's not you, Sam.

685
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,368
I wouldn't do that, Dean.

686
00:40:48,538 --> 00:40:49,705
He deserves to know.

687
00:40:49,707 --> 00:40:51,857
Your brother is not ready.

688
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:53,409
If he ejects me,
he will not make it.

689
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:55,461
Damn it, Zeke! How much longer
we got to keep playing this?

690
00:40:55,463 --> 00:40:57,380
Not much longer.

691
00:40:57,382 --> 00:40:59,365
I promise you that.

692
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:03,169
What?

693
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:04,103
What?

694
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:07,340
What?
What -- what's not me?

695
00:41:09,776 --> 00:41:14,263
Nothing. I just --
I-I meant that...

696
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:16,983
If there is
something wrong...

697
00:41:16,985 --> 00:41:18,067
It's not your fault.

698
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:20,853
We'll deal with it.

699
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:25,925
But you got to have
a little faith, Sammy.
