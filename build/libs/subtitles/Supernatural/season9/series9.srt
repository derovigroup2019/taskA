1
00:00:02,774 --> 00:00:04,140
Cass, are you there?

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:05,397
Sammy's hurt.

3
00:00:05,704 --> 00:00:06,964
He's hurt pretty bad.

4
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:08,393
I know you think
that I'm pissed at you.

5
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:11,448
Cass, can we talk?
You can't stay.

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,567
I don't care
that the angels fell.

7
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:15,536
So, whatever you did...

8
00:00:15,538 --> 00:00:17,671
I didn't know he was gonna cast
the angels out of Heaven.

9
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:20,073
Metatron.
He's the scribe of God.

10
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:21,208
These were never trials.

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,292
This is a spell.

12
00:00:22,294 --> 00:00:24,628
He took my Grace.
It's why I'm human.

13
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,246
It doesn't matter, okay?
We'll work it out.

14
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:28,365
It's a tablet.
Now translate. It's what you do.

15
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:30,300
Kevin,
you are a Prophet of the Lord.

16
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:33,137
Please, man, I need you here.

17
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:36,440
If angels come a-knockin',
you just let 'em on in.

18
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:38,559
Beautiful, Buddy.
Thank you, Bart.

19
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:39,977
It's Bartholomew.

20
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,562
Our fallen brothers
and sisters

21
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:44,114
are finding vessels
faster than we'd even hoped.

22
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:46,650
This one goes out to any angel
with their ears on.

23
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:47,651
I need your help.

24
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:49,603
Start with a name.
Ezekiel.

25
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:50,988
There is a chance
I can fix your brother.

26
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,539
I heal Sam
while healing myself.

27
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:53,540
A possession?

28
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:55,108
I'm a mess, Dean.
You know it.

29
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,127
I can't let you put this
on yourself.

30
00:00:58,096 --> 00:00:59,730
I wouldn't do that, Dean.

31
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:08,622
? This little light of mine

32
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:12,459
? I'm gonna let it shine

33
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:15,646
? this little light of mine

34
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:19,316
? I'm gonna let it shine

35
00:01:19,318 --> 00:01:23,153
? this little light of mine

36
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:25,472
? I'm gonna let it shine

37
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:33,295
? let it shine, let it shine,
let it shine ?

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,819
? you got a nasty disposition

39
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:41,672
? no one really knows
the reason why ?

40
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:46,343
? you got
a bad, bad reputation ?

41
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:50,264
? gonna hang your head down
and cry ?

42
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:54,768
? you got bad, bad luck

43
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,021
? bad, bad luck

44
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:00,841
? you got bad, bad luck

45
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:02,226
You shouldn't be here.

46
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:06,313
We have just as much right
to be here as you do, brother.

47
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:10,184
? 13 is my lucky number

48
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:13,237
? to you, it means stay inside

49
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:29,586
? No one really knows
the reason why ?

50
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:33,390
? your enemies
are gettin' nearer ?

51
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:37,594
? gonna hang down your head
and cry ?

52
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:41,849
? you got bad, bad luck

53
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:44,234
? bad, bad luck

54
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:46,470
All right, girls, everybody.

55
00:02:46,472 --> 00:02:50,324
? This little light of mine

56
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:53,527
? I'm gonna let it shine

57
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:57,529

59
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:06,023
So, he's better?

60
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:08,458
Yes.

61
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,027
Sam is much improved.

62
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:12,679
It shouldn't be
much longer now.

63
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:17,267
Okay, you know you said the same
thing to me last week, right?

64
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:20,604
As I told you when we met,
this will take time.

65
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:24,358
Okay, well, go then.

66
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,893
Heal.

67
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:28,111
I'd like my brother back,
please.

68
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:32,366
I must say, Dean,

69
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:34,768
I'm very uncomfortable
with this whole trip.

70
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,905
Investigating crimes
involving angels

71
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:40,007
or anything involving angels

72
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:42,910
puts me, and therefore, Sam,
at risk.

73
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:44,745
Well, family business, Zeke.
Okay?

74
00:03:44,747 --> 00:03:45,946
If we ignore this,

75
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:48,248
Sam's gonna think
that something fishy's going on.

76
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,619
Then I trust
you will be discreet.

77
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:55,556
Wait,
if you know where we're going,

78
00:03:55,558 --> 00:03:57,174
that means
you've been listening in.

79
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:59,643
Are you -- are you hearing
everything between me and Sam?

80
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:01,511
No.

81
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:03,814
Just a word here and there.

82
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:07,334
I have better things to do
with my time than eavesdrop,

83
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:08,735
like heal your brother.

84
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:11,154
Okay,
'cause here's the thing --

85
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:12,406
You know,
I was gonna say it seems

86
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:14,191
like it's getting really quiet
out there, you know?

87
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:15,242
Not a peep from the angels,

88
00:04:15,244 --> 00:04:17,110
even Buddy Boyle
goes off the air

89
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:18,478
and stops recruiting for them.

90
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,330
Obviously a calm
before the storm.

91
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:23,283
Yeah, maybe.

92
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,538
What?

93
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,342
That sign said
"Fort Collins, 50 miles."

94
00:04:32,344 --> 00:04:33,460
So?

95
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:37,648
So, last time I looked,
like, 12 seconds ago,

96
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,133
uh,
fort Collins was 100 miles.

97
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:42,269
Well, hey, man,

98
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:44,337
ever since that goddess
got her hooks into you --

99
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,472
No, it's more than Vesta.

100
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:47,391
I mean, this kind of thing's
been happening to me.

101
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:50,360
Like, like, there are
chunks of time just missing.

102
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:53,530
Like, there are times
when I'm...not here.

103
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:55,782
Well, like I've said --

104
00:04:55,784 --> 00:04:57,200
Yes, the trials.
I know. I heard you.

105
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:58,785
I heard you
when you said it the last week

106
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:00,520
and the week before that
and the week before that.

107
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:03,290
Yeah, because damn straight
the trials.

108
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:04,741
They whacked you, man.

109
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:07,411
You're not up to warp speed yet,
okay?

110
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:08,578
But you will be.

111
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,530
Would I lie?

112
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:25,262
Uh, one of your guys
is here already.

113
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,085
Ah, my colleagues.

114
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,076
Agent.

115
00:05:56,078 --> 00:05:57,794
Agent.

116
00:05:57,796 --> 00:05:59,963
Cass.
What the hell are you doing?

117
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:04,051
Um, I still have that badge
you gave me.

118
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:06,019
Yeah. Uh,
what the hell are you doing?

119
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:09,056
The murders
were all over the news.

120
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,774
Uh, I thought
I might be of help.

121
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:15,595
Yeah, but Cass, you know this is
an angel situation, right?

122
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:18,448
I mean, you left that night
because angels were on your ass.

123
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,767
Yeah, and you were living
the life, you know?

124
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,603
Early retirement, working your
way up the Gas-n-Sip ladder.

125
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:26,106
Well, if angels are slaughtering
one another,

126
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:28,075
I have to do
what I can to help.

127
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,944
This is a risk
we should be willing to take,

128
00:06:30,946 --> 00:06:32,278
don't you think?

129
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:35,248
Hey.

130
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,085
Cass is back in town.

131
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:39,786
Seriously, did you --
did he just say that?

132
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:44,508
These angels, uh,
they were butchered.

133
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,094
Much more violence
than was required.

134
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:51,782
Definitely took
more than one or two killers

135
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:53,150
to pull this off.

136
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:55,819
Hit squad?
Bartholomew's people?

137
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:57,738
Well, Bartholomew
has a faction we know about,

138
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,556
but this could be
somebody else entirely.

139
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:00,807
We don't know.

140
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:05,028
Well, whoever it is...

141
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,148
We'll find them.

142
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,535
<i>We'll</i> find them.

143
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:12,986
That's great.

144
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,411
Good evening, Malachi.

145
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:13,379
Where is he?

146
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:16,382
Bartholomew
is quite busy tonight.

147
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:18,969
With such a large following,

148
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:21,321
well, the responsibilities
are enormous.

149
00:08:21,323 --> 00:08:23,523
I called
for a top-level summit.

150
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:25,725
I don't deal
with hand maidens.

151
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:29,279
I'll convey your thoughts
to Bartholomew.

152
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:31,731
He'll regret
the disrespect.

153
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:35,018
You speak of disrespect,
Malachi?

154
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,571
After the bloodbath
two nights ago?

155
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:40,073
Bartholomew's naked grab
for power

156
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:42,242
was nothing but disrespect!

157
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,431
He and I ultimately want
the same thing.

158
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:52,118
The only way we can take Heaven
back from Metatron is to unite.

159
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,022
And if Bartholomew wants to
avoid all-out warfare on Earth,

160
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:59,759
he'll meet personally with me
to negotiate terms.

161
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:02,229
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:05,682
I should've mentioned earlier,
Bartholomew said to tell you

163
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:08,351
he doesn't negotiate
with street thugs.

164
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,604
Are we done here?

165
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:15,725
Yes, we are.

166
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:30,757
And so it begins.

167
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:44,938
It is so good being together
again.

168
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,575
You know, this is my fist beer
as a human.

169
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:52,545
I hope it's okay,
me joining you.

170
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:54,447
Why wouldn't it be okay?

171
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,785
You know, Cass,
are you sure you're ready

172
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:00,337
to jump back
into all this?

173
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:03,290
I mean, it seemed to me like
you'd actually found some peace.

174
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:07,594
Hey, you once told me that you
don't choose what you do.

175
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:09,095
It chooses you.

176
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:14,217
Huh?
I'm a part of this.

177
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:16,436
Like it or not.

178
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,941
All right, well, then,
in that case,

179
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:23,176
we have to figure out, uh,
who are we up against,

180
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:24,978
what do they want,
and how do we stop them.

181
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,882
Well, Bartholomew wants
to reverse Metatron's spell.

182
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:32,185
Presumably to --
to retake Heaven

183
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:34,454
once his following
is large enough.

184
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:36,189
That's according to April.

185
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:38,191
The reaper you banged.

186
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:40,193
Yeah, and you stabbed.

187
00:10:40,195 --> 00:10:41,494
Yeah.

188
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:42,528
She was hot.

189
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,798
So hot.

190
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,849
And very nice.

191
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:47,334
Mm.

192
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:51,221
Up to the point
she started torturing me.

193
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:52,472
Yeah.

194
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:54,540
Well, not every hookup's
perfect.

195
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,643
All right.
I'm gonna get us another round.

196
00:10:56,645 --> 00:10:59,712
Nah.
I'll get it.

197
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:02,132
Mm.

198
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:03,650
You know,
I've never done this before.

199
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:06,686
One beer, he's hammered.

200
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:11,725
Oh, boy.

201
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:15,445
Well, what are you going to do
about this?

202
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:19,249
About Cass?

203
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:20,500
He is a beacon, Dean,

204
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:23,336
pulling every angel
for miles down on our heads.

205
00:11:23,338 --> 00:11:25,255
All right, you know what, Zeke?
Level with me.

206
00:11:25,257 --> 00:11:26,923
What is it
that you're so afraid of?

207
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:29,426
I told you.

208
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:32,262
When I chose to answer
your prayers and heal Sam,

209
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:33,913
I chose sides.

210
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:36,182
That means I'm not in good
standing with certain angels.

211
00:11:36,184 --> 00:11:37,154
Okay, well, you know what?

212
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,387
Cass isn't in good standing
with <i>any</i> angel, all right?

213
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:42,722
But here he is, ass on the line,
fighting the fight.

214
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:44,391
So tell me,
what makes you so special?

215
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:46,026
Here we go.

216
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:48,395
Three brewskies.

217
00:11:48,397 --> 00:11:51,031
I'm going to get something
out of the car.

218
00:11:57,906 --> 00:12:01,708
Well, I'm really
looking forward to this.

219
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,043
Excuse me?

220
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:05,912
Oh, please.

221
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:11,568
I know who you really are.

222
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,420
And it isn't Ezekiel.

223
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:32,897
I, um, noticed you look...
kind of uncomfortable

224
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:36,501
whenever Sam mentions
my leaving.

225
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,723
Doesn't he know
that you told me to leave?

226
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:45,376
Here's the deal.

227
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:49,063
When Sam was doing the trials
to seal up Hell,

228
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:50,298
it messed him up.

229
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,165
Okay?

230
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,650
The third one
nearly killed him.

231
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:55,620
If I'd let him finish,
it would have.

232
00:12:55,622 --> 00:12:59,690
He's still messed up bad.

233
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:05,196
You said the angel Ezekiel
helped heal him.

234
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:11,452
Look, I got to do anything I can
to get him back.

235
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:14,655
Now, if that means that we keep
our distance from you

236
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:16,290
for a little while, then...

237
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:18,559
Then I don't have a choice.

238
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:22,663
I don't feel good about it,
but I don't have a choice.

239
00:13:22,665 --> 00:13:26,450
It's great to have your help,
Cass.

240
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:31,556
Okay, but we just can't
work together.

241
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,994
Relax.
I'm not here to out you.

242
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:40,097
But I <i>am</i> curious,
why Ezekiel?

243
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:47,638
They say he is
a good and honorable angel.

244
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,558
Ahh.

245
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,593
Everything they say
you are not.

246
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:55,296
I see your point...

247
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:57,698
Gadreel.

248
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,984
The stories about me,
they are not true.

249
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:03,153
And yet you spent countless
thousands of years

250
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:05,656
locked
in heaven's darkest dungeon,

251
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:12,830
and now you're hiding
in this human posing as Ezekiel.

252
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,265
Tragic.

253
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:18,135
It broke his heart
to lock you away, you know?

254
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:21,789
You were God's most trusted.

255
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,842
That's why he chose you
to protect the garden.

256
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:29,847
Your one task was to keep evil
from entering...

257
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,984
from befouling
his cherished creation, mankind,

258
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,368
and you failed him.

259
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,486
Not my doing.

260
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:38,873
Well, for whatever reason,
the serpent entered.

261
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,375
The Earth
is cursed with evil.

262
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:44,128
Someone had to be blamed.

263
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:47,999
What is it you want of me,
Metatron?

264
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:50,651
Just to be your friend.

265
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,954
You and I
go back a long way.

266
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:55,973
I was actually the one
who freed you.

267
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,558
You?

268
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,181
I was the one who caused
all the angels to fall.

269
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,553
Including
the imprisoned ones.

270
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:11,756
You're welcome.

271
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:14,325
No angels are in heaven.

272
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:15,860
None at all.

273
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:20,731
No, and you know, at first,
I thought I would love it.

274
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,667
But it's a big place.

275
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:25,703
My solitude
is getting tedious.

276
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:27,922
And so?

277
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:30,841
And so...

278
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,960
Plan "B."

279
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:38,299
Rebuild heaven
as the place God envisioned it,

280
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:39,967
only with a handpicked few.

281
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:44,689
No more anemic functionaries
like Bartholomew.

282
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:47,491
And no more stupid angels.

283
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,896
Maybe some funny ones.

284
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:57,601
You were his most trusted,
Gadreel.

285
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:00,037
You want to take back
your reputation,

286
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,908
you want to reclaim
the heaven that was?

287
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,494
We could do this together.

288
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,051
Any word from Cass?

289
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,136
Nothing yet.

290
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:17,838
And we're not worried
about him,

291
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,091
that he just took off
like that again?

292
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:23,010
I mean, it's not like he does
this kind of stuff alone.

293
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:25,096
It's the way he wanted it.
Honestly.

294
00:16:25,098 --> 00:16:27,631
Look, man,
he's been all over the map

295
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,150
since he got
his wings clipped.

296
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:30,685
What do you got?

297
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:33,304
Obituaries.
That one of the bikers?

298
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:34,939
Yeah.
His name was Red Dawg.

299
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:36,290
Of course it was.

300
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:38,125
It's not what you think.
He's a family guy.

301
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:41,062
Big in the PTA, he played Santa
at Christmas parties.

302
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:43,581
So, what? Just one day,
he up and joined a biker gang?

303
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,699
No, he did that years ago.

304
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,000
Get this.
This is weird.

305
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:49,036
Look. These are all the victims,
right?

306
00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:50,771
They were
all baptized together.

307
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:52,540
Baptized?
Yeah.

308
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,760
They were
a born-again biker gang.

309
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:59,013
Well, that is not something
you hear every day.

310
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:00,598
No, it's not.

311
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,682
Wait, make that bigger.

312
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:05,302
Boyle's boys?

313
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,605
Boyle,
as in reverend Buddy Boyle?

314
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:10,391
Listen to this.

315
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:12,560
Red Dawg's widow said
he was always religious,

316
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:13,677
but a week before he died,

317
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,345
he came home
from a prayer meeting

318
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:18,366
and was a changed man
filled with divine glory.

319
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:19,700
So, Boyle's at it again.

320
00:17:19,702 --> 00:17:22,319
Selling folks
on being meat suits for angels.

321
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:24,705
Just what --
talking to smaller groups now?

322
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:25,706
I don't know.

323
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,691
Maybe softening up
thousands at a time,

324
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:30,077
he wasn't able to control
what angels got let in.

325
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,362
This way, Bartholomew's
followers can jump in

326
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:34,331
just as soon
as Boyle does his thing.

327
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,302
So, Red Dawg and his guys
were Bartholomew people?

328
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,054
Yeah,
and they got slaughtered,

329
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:42,490
which means that this new group
is even worse.

330
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:46,260
Haven't I always said
that angels are dicks?

331
00:17:46,262 --> 00:17:48,545
And I so appreciate
the opportunity

332
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,681
to address
your Bible-study group.

333
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:54,402
I admire your passion,
your energy, your devotion.

334
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:58,322
You are exactly what God
and his angels have in mind

335
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:59,690
for the crusade.

336
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:03,194
Now rise.

337
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:05,863
Join hands, all of you.

338
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:11,252
Feel the heavenly host
reach out to embrace you.

339
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:13,587
Embrace them back.

340
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:18,542
The angels want nothing more
than to feel your love.

341
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:20,594
Welcome them
into your hearts.

342
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:22,046
Let them in!

343
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:25,015
In the name of Malachi,
let them in!

344
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:32,106
No!

345
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,154
Frankly,
I never got use to them.

346
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:53,809
I lived among them
for centuries.

347
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:56,972
I had to isolate myself
to keep sane.

348
00:18:56,974 --> 00:19:01,226
Humans do seem chaotic,
Metatron.

349
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:05,097
Which makes them fascinating,
but...

350
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:06,999
All that emotion.

351
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:07,850
Geez.

352
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:10,002
And the wasted energy.

353
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:11,817
It's just...exhausting.

354
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:12,894
I know.

355
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:15,801
Sam Winchester...

356
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:19,411
It is a mess in here.

357
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:22,381
And the brother,
I do not know where to start.

358
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:25,484
I can free you from them.

359
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:29,321
From all of them.

360
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:34,109
You intend to be the ruler of
this new heaven, am I correct?

361
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:36,401
Uh...

362
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:43,986
It is a burden
I feel I must accept.

363
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:47,706
Then Metatron,
does that not make you God?

364
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,542
Oh.

365
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:54,329
Semantics.

366
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:58,717
I don't know that I'd take on
that name...necessarily.

367
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,718
No.

368
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,640
When the time comes,
we'll call me...

369
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:06,141
"X."

370
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:09,461
"X"?

371
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:13,332
You and I...

372
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:17,802
We could have paradise again,
Gadreel.

373
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:21,757
Okay.

374
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:27,145
I'm...unfamiliar
with this end of the process.

375
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:33,802
'Course,
no one may be listening,

376
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:37,506
um, but I-I do need assistance.

377
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:42,878
I have questions,
and there seem to be no answers.

378
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,947
I...I wouldn't presume
to ask for help

379
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:47,182
if I weren't desperate,
but I need help.

380
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:48,951
I'm lost.

381
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:50,419
I need your guidance.

382
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:53,722
Please hear my prayer.

383
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:01,647
I don't know how humans do it.

384
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:10,155
Try plugging it in.

385
00:21:17,163 --> 00:21:20,582
Surely that wasn't the answer
you were seeking.

386
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:22,000
You're an angel.

387
00:21:22,002 --> 00:21:23,952
Muriel.

388
00:21:23,954 --> 00:21:27,673
I didn't pick the outfit.

389
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:32,311
Castiel?

390
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:34,313
No, wait.
Please, just hear me out.

391
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:36,565
It can't be known
that I even spoke to you.

392
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:38,467
I just need a moment.
No.

393
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:39,685
Please.

394
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:43,438
I just need information.

395
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:47,993
Dean,
there may be nothing in here.

396
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:51,563
Crowley said the spell
that cast down the angels

397
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:52,931
was irreversible.

398
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:54,316
Yeah, well, screw Crowley.

399
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:56,501
Why would you think
that anything he says is true?

400
00:21:56,503 --> 00:22:01,106
This part
is nearly indecipherable.

401
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:03,442
Almost like
when Metatron wrote it down,

402
00:22:03,444 --> 00:22:05,594
he wanted
to keep the words hidden,

403
00:22:05,596 --> 00:22:08,580
even from Prophets.

404
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:09,748
Hey.

405
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,250
Hey.
Check this out.

406
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:14,052
Another angel attack.

407
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:16,254
What? Where?

408
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:17,522
Utah.

409
00:22:17,524 --> 00:22:20,559
A, uh,
college Bible-study group

410
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:24,563
and their, uh, guest speaker --
some top-shelf church lady.

411
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,931
Insides scorched out,
kids' eyes were missing,

412
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:28,116
but not the church lady's.

413
00:22:28,118 --> 00:22:31,203
So, she was an angel,
too?

414
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:32,170
Sounds like.

415
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:33,705
Uh, and she sang soprano

416
00:22:33,707 --> 00:22:36,408
for the, uh,
Melody Ministry glee club.

417
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,077
Okay.

418
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,129
The club goes to its gigs
on a bus,

419
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:43,498
so when I checked
with the Wyoming cops,

420
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,336
they said that a witness saw the
same bus leaving the biker bar

421
00:22:47,338 --> 00:22:49,154
not long before the bodies
were found.

422
00:22:49,156 --> 00:22:51,506
So, church-lady angel was
at both killings?

423
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:57,095
I'm guessing that she
and whoever she's running with

424
00:22:57,097 --> 00:22:59,181
killed Bartholomew's bikers
at the bar

425
00:22:59,183 --> 00:23:00,515
and then Bart's boys
hit her back.

426
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:02,801
When she was recruiting
those students to be vessels

427
00:23:04,804 --> 00:23:07,873
Wow. A bunch of kids.

428
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,775
Kevin.

429
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:12,694
Clock's ticking.

430
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,332
Let's say you're telling the
truth and Metatron tricked you.

431
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:18,784
I should still turn you in.

432
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:21,152
But you won't.

433
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:23,922
Don't be so sure.

434
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:28,176
I...I think
you instinctively trust me.

435
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:30,045
We're similar.

436
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:32,931
We both want no part
of the fanatics.

437
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:36,435
And when you prayed,

438
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:38,687
how did you know
you wouldn't get one of them?

439
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:41,473
I'm warded and my Grace is gone
and I was hoping

440
00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:44,359
that I would seem like
just another desperate human

441
00:23:44,361 --> 00:23:47,512
that the...the militants
couldn't care less about.

442
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:48,964
And you think <i>I</i> care?

443
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:51,349
You're here.

444
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:53,685
You may know the situation.

445
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:56,121
Bartholomew, he's in a blood
feud with another faction.

446
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:58,039
It's madness.

447
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,908
Who leads the opposition?

448
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,059
Malachi.

449
00:24:01,061 --> 00:24:03,712
Malachi?
The anarchist.

450
00:24:03,714 --> 00:24:06,965
He's become equals
with Bartholomew.

451
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,667
In some ways, worse.

452
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:12,137
But there's still those like you
who want to stay out of it.

453
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:13,505
Fewer and fewer.

454
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:16,425
Each side is rounding up
those who try and stay neutral.

455
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:18,510
Angels are being tortured
and killed

456
00:24:18,512 --> 00:24:19,978
if they don't pledge loyalty.

457
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,347
It's worse than I thought.

458
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:24,716
Each side
wants to crush the other,

459
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:27,636
overthrow Metatron,
and rule Heaven,

460
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:31,223
and...Heaven
under either of them would be...

461
00:24:31,225 --> 00:24:32,858
Hell.

462
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:46,455
This is a bonus, Castiel.

463
00:24:46,457 --> 00:24:51,660
We were tracking Muriel,
cowardly holdout that she is,

464
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:57,098
and wonder of wonders,
she led us to you.

465
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,686
Not knowingly.

466
00:25:01,688 --> 00:25:03,638
I stand corrected.

467
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,357
Not knowingly.

468
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,558
Stupidly.

469
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,112
I've explained in detail.

470
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:13,765
I don't know
how Metatron's spell worked.

471
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:18,370
Therefore,
I can't assist in reversing it.

472
00:25:18,372 --> 00:25:20,372
I was
an unwitting accomplice.

473
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:22,240
Oh.

474
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:25,043
A dupe.

475
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:27,212
The great Castiel.

476
00:25:27,214 --> 00:25:30,215
Valued and trusted Castiel.

477
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:34,336
Top-of-the-Christmas-tree
Castiel, no more than a dupe.

478
00:25:36,673 --> 00:25:40,091
Dupe or mastermind,
you were inside the circle.

479
00:25:40,093 --> 00:25:43,311
You know
where Metatron's weakness lies.

480
00:25:44,814 --> 00:25:46,681
No.

481
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:48,149
I don't.

482
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:55,407
Theo.

483
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:58,476
No.

484
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:08,770
You'd suffer,
even die for your beliefs.

485
00:26:08,772 --> 00:26:10,121
I get it.

486
00:26:10,123 --> 00:26:13,441
But is Metatron, whose poll
numbers have totally tanked...

487
00:26:13,443 --> 00:26:15,877
...worth your life?

488
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:20,515
More importantly,
is Metatron worth her life?

489
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:25,020
No.

490
00:26:25,022 --> 00:26:27,022
No, she's innocent.

491
00:26:27,024 --> 00:26:29,007
You leave her alone.

492
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:33,445
I have no intentions
on touching her.

493
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:45,073
Virtue
is its own punishment.

494
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,460
Please, no!

495
00:26:48,462 --> 00:26:50,478
No!

496
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:02,746
Angels butchering angels.

497
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:08,157
Is this what we've become?

498
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,882
Just following your example,
Castiel.

499
00:27:11,883 --> 00:27:14,417
How many
did you kill in Heaven?

500
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:17,304
How many in the Fall?

501
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:21,224
Oh, you didn't know?

502
00:27:21,226 --> 00:27:23,526
A host of angels died
en they fell --

503
00:27:23,528 --> 00:27:26,813
Azrael, Sophia, Ezekiel.

504
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:29,232
"Died"
doesn't even describe it.

505
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:30,400
Devastation.

506
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:35,572
Wings shredded,
unspeakable agony at your hands.

507
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:36,790
So, I think

508
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:41,411
you would want to provide
any information you have,

509
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:45,048
considering...

510
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,969
All right.

511
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:52,472
I leave you
in the hands of an artist.

512
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,678
I don't care what's left.

513
00:28:01,232 --> 00:28:04,351
Don't ask for mercy.

514
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:08,021
There is none.

515
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:17,247
I'll give you one last chance
for this to end.

516
00:28:21,318 --> 00:28:25,338
Give me a quick death.

517
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:33,229
I need you to speak
to Metatron.

518
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:36,800
Everyone knows
you have influence.

519
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,968
He'll listen to you.

520
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,688
Ask him
to raise me to Heaven.

521
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:46,843
You can do this,
Castiel.

522
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:49,646
I'll be a soldier for Metatron,
do anything he wants.

523
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,901
You -- you serve Malachi.

524
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:56,986
I thought he was the answer,
but he's crazy.

525
00:28:56,988 --> 00:29:00,623
You're...noticing this now?

526
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,826
You were more than willing
to do his dirty work.

527
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,911
I did what I had to.

528
00:29:04,913 --> 00:29:08,331
When you were sure
he would defeat Bartholomew.

529
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,884
But no one will survive
this war.

530
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:13,887
So, you prefer to sit it out
in Heaven.

531
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:17,607
I can talk to him
about restoring your grace.

532
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:24,431
Well,
it's, um, it's true.

533
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:27,884
Metatron and I do have
a working relationship.

534
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:30,587
I knew it.

535
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:33,223
You're clever, Theo.

536
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:34,941
You're allies.

537
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:41,448
And he could use
a skilled soldier like yourself.

538
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,399
Oh, but I don't know.

539
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:45,785
I-I'm a team player,
Castiel.

540
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,244
All right. Well?

541
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:12,862
I'll -- I'll need a moment
to make contact.

542
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:25,341
And you have something
that I'll need.

543
00:30:25,343 --> 00:30:27,610
Anything.

544
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:38,421
Mm.

545
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:18,044
No.

546
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:23,132
Oh, no.

547
00:31:37,114 --> 00:31:39,115
Hey.
You seen Sam?

548
00:31:39,117 --> 00:31:40,366
He went out.

549
00:31:40,368 --> 00:31:41,183
Where?

550
00:31:41,185 --> 00:31:42,285
I don't know.

551
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:45,054
You notice he's doing that
a lot?

552
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:47,490
Yeah.

553
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:51,911
Yeah.

554
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:54,080
Dean, I don't have
a lot of time, so listen.

555
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:56,749
The leader of the opposition
is an angel named Malachi.

556
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:58,418
How do you know that?

557
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,819
He had me.

558
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:02,204
I, uh, I was tortured.

559
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:04,674
But I got away.
How?

560
00:32:04,676 --> 00:32:10,513
I...I did what I had to.

561
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:13,182
I became
what they've become.

562
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:14,767
A barbarian.

563
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:17,553
What are you --
Cass, where are you?

564
00:32:17,555 --> 00:32:20,023
It's better I stay away.

565
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,874
They're gonna want me
even more now.

566
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:23,893
But I'm gonna be all right.

567
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:26,029
I...I got my Grace back.

568
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:30,416
Well, not mine per se,
but it'll do.

569
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:32,619
Wait, you're -- you're back?
You got your mojo?

570
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:35,288
I'm not sure.

571
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,173
But I <i>am</i> an angel.

572
00:32:37,175 --> 00:32:38,925
And you're okay with that?

573
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:43,713
If we're going to war,
I need to be ready.

574
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:45,298
Cass.

575
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,916
Dean.

576
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,584
There's more.

577
00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:49,802
What?

578
00:32:49,804 --> 00:32:54,590
Didn't you say Sam was healed
by an angel named Ezekiel?

579
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:58,094
Uh...Yeah, why?

580
00:32:58,096 --> 00:33:01,781
Ezekiel is dead.

581
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:04,284
What?

582
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:08,288
He died
when the angels fell.

583
00:33:11,576 --> 00:33:13,609
I need a spell, ASAP.

584
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:17,947
Everyone always needs a spell,
and it's always ASAP.

585
00:33:17,949 --> 00:33:19,299
All right, listen to me.

586
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:22,001
An angel can't be expelled
by another human.

587
00:33:22,003 --> 00:33:23,419
Only by the host, right?

588
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:26,889
Well, what if there was a way
to power down the angel

589
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:28,791
so that it wasn't in charge
for a few seconds?

590
00:33:28,793 --> 00:33:30,009
What?

591
00:33:30,011 --> 00:33:31,728
For instance,
if -- if hypothetically,

592
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,346
I wanted to speak
with the vessel

593
00:33:33,348 --> 00:33:35,081
but not have the squatter
listen in.

594
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,016
Why?

595
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:38,217
Why?

596
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:41,037
Kevin, we've got tons
of possessed humans out there.

597
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,105
You with me?

598
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:44,023
And when the angels
kill each other off,

599
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:45,808
the humans
are taking it in the teeth,

600
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,610
so what if I wanted
to clue the human in

601
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:50,079
so that he or she
could spit the angel out?

602
00:33:50,081 --> 00:33:52,098
That would be a good thing,
right?

603
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,200
Uh...Yeah.

604
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:56,819
Okay. So, hit the tablet.
Let's go.

605
00:33:56,821 --> 00:33:58,004
Now?

606
00:33:58,006 --> 00:34:00,540
Yesterday, Cinderella.

607
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:10,083
I've been thinking this over,
Metatron.

608
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:14,937
I will join you
as second in command.

609
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:20,360
Bravo, Gadreel.

610
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:25,114
This move
will erase the mark

611
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:27,683
that has hounded you
through the centuries.

612
00:34:27,685 --> 00:34:30,536
Heaven will be restored,

613
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:34,957
as will your reputation
as one of its greatest heroes.

614
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:38,244
I thank you
for this opportunity.

615
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:42,131
There is
just one more thing.

616
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:43,583
Yes.

617
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:46,803
I need to be sure
of your fidelity.

618
00:34:46,805 --> 00:34:49,088
You have it.

619
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:53,009
No, I mean <i>really</i> sure.

620
00:34:53,011 --> 00:34:59,649
We have enemies who pose an
imminent threat to our effort.

621
00:34:59,651 --> 00:35:01,851
They must be neutralized.

622
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:04,821
Slain?

623
00:35:04,823 --> 00:35:07,389
In a word.

624
00:35:07,391 --> 00:35:10,359
That...

625
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:12,728
That is not who I am.

626
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,832
Yeah.

627
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:18,751
Here's the first name
on your to-do list.

628
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:33,850
Decide.

629
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:44,936
All right, so this masterpiece
we just painted,

630
00:35:44,938 --> 00:35:46,154
it's gonna work, right?

631
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:48,406
The Sigils
are supposed to briefly hobble

632
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:49,524
the possessing angel.

633
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:50,692
If the info's correct.

634
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:51,993
Wait, what?

635
00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:54,362
I only had time
to get a little from the tablet.

636
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:56,581
The rest came
from an old Men of Letters book.

637
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:59,834
As soon as your blood touches
the ignition Sigil,

638
00:35:59,836 --> 00:36:01,970
the spell kicks in.

639
00:36:03,172 --> 00:36:05,707
Dean, what's going on?

640
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:07,408
I told you.

641
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,127
You told me theoretically.

642
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:12,447
Dean, we just painted Sigils
in the storeroom.

643
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:13,464
What the hell?

644
00:36:13,466 --> 00:36:15,717
You're gonna
have to trust me.

645
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:19,420
Okay, trust that I told you
everything that I can for now.

646
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:20,588
Can you do that?

647
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,941
I always trust you.

648
00:36:23,925 --> 00:36:25,827
And I always end up screwed.

649
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:27,996
Oh, come on.
Always?

650
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:31,232
Not <i>always.</i>

651
00:36:33,153 --> 00:36:34,802
Hey, where you been?

652
00:36:34,804 --> 00:36:37,822
Hey. Beer run.

653
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:39,190
Long beer run.

654
00:36:40,476 --> 00:36:41,693
Can we talk?

655
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:45,697
Yeah.
Uh...Sure.

656
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:50,451
This sounds serious.

657
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,546
What's going on?

658
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:03,164
What are you doing?

659
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:05,049
I got to tell you
some stuff fast.

660
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:06,267
It's gonna piss you off.

661
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:08,019
Okay.

662
00:37:08,021 --> 00:37:11,055
Those trials
really messed you up.

663
00:37:11,057 --> 00:37:13,107
Yes, I know that.

664
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:14,108
No, you don't.

665
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,943
I mean messed you up
like almost dead.

666
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:18,229
No more birthdays,
dust to dust.

667
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:20,481
Well, that messed me up,
so I made a move,

668
00:37:20,483 --> 00:37:22,367
okay, a tough move about you
without talking it over

669
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:23,818
because you were
in a coma.

670
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,903
Wait, what? When?

671
00:37:25,905 --> 00:37:27,522
You were in the hospital,
okay,

672
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:29,240
and they said
you were gonna die.

673
00:37:29,242 --> 00:37:32,043
Dean.
What did you do?

674
00:37:34,763 --> 00:37:36,164
I let an angel in.

675
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:39,851
In what?

676
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:42,003
In you.

677
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:44,922
He said he could heal you
and he is.

678
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:46,290
He's still in me?

679
00:37:47,593 --> 00:37:50,377
Wait.
That's impossible, Dean.

680
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:52,196
That couldn't happen.
I never invited him in.

681
00:37:52,198 --> 00:37:54,632
I tricked you into saying yes.
It seemed like the only way.

682
00:37:59,355 --> 00:38:02,990
So...Again.

683
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:06,944
You thought I couldn't handle
something, so you took over.

684
00:38:06,946 --> 00:38:09,197
No,
I did what I had to do!

685
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,365
You would've never agreed to it,
and you would've died.

686
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:13,217
Well, maybe I would've liked
the choice, at least.

687
00:38:13,219 --> 00:38:14,252
We can do this later.

688
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:16,170
You can -- you can kick my ass
all you want.

689
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:17,822
Right now,
we got bigger problems.

690
00:38:17,824 --> 00:38:19,690
Bigger?

691
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:22,376
The angel lied to me.
Okay?

692
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:24,078
He -- he's not
who he said he was.

693
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,346
He said his name was Ezekiel.

694
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:27,548
Cool guy, according to Cass,
but it's not Ezekiel.

695
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,684
Who is he?
I don't know.

696
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,753
Apparently,
Ezekiel is dead.

697
00:38:31,755 --> 00:38:35,389
Whoever this guy is can end you
in a heartbeat if he wants to,

698
00:38:35,391 --> 00:38:37,024
so you have got to dump him.

699
00:38:39,496 --> 00:38:42,763
Are you hearing
what I'm saying?

700
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:46,767
I think you're well enough now,
but you got to expel him.

701
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:49,620
Sam.

702
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:53,207
Sa--

703
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:55,827
hey.

704
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:07,021
Hey, Sam.

705
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,794
Hey,
do you notice anything

706
00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:16,347
a little bit off
about Dean lately?

707
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:18,099
Between you and me, I'm
a little bit worried about him.

708
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:20,801
Don't worry about Dean.

709
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:22,520
Dean will be fine.

710
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:30,661
No!

711
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:35,316
No! No! No! Kevin?!

712
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:40,371
Sam?

713
00:39:42,207 --> 00:39:43,774
There is no more Sam.

714
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,714
But I played him convincingly,
I thought.

715
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,637
How did you...

716
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,273
I heard you talk with Kevin Tran
tonight.

717
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:02,360
Told me theoretically.

718
00:40:02,362 --> 00:40:04,362
Dean, we just painted Sigils
in the storeroom.

719
00:40:04,364 --> 00:40:06,280
What the hell?

720
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:07,798
You're gonna
have to trust me, okay,

721
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,534
and trust that I told you
everything I can for now.

722
00:40:09,536 --> 00:40:10,868
Can you do that?

723
00:40:13,155 --> 00:40:16,490
Alter a Sigil...

724
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:19,961
even the slightest...

725
00:40:19,963 --> 00:40:22,079
Alter the spell.

726
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:29,387
Sorry about Kevin,
but ultimately...

727
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:35,593
...it's for the best.

728
00:40:35,595 --> 00:40:40,064
I did what I had to.

729
00:41:19,455 --> 00:41:23,090
Kevin?

730
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:31,899
Kevin?

731
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:36,924
