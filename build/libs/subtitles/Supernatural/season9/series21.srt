1
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:04,842
Angels are slaughtering
one another.

2
00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:06,910
It's open warfare.

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,111
What happened here?

4
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:09,746
A strange angel arrived.

5
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:11,615
He said he worked
for the new God.

6
00:00:11,617 --> 00:00:14,284
I will find Metatron,
and I will make him pay.

7
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:17,454
Lead the angels
against me, Castiel.

8
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:20,757
I know who you really are.
Gadreel.

9
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,192
What is it you want of me,
Metatron?

10
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:23,493
Rebuild heaven.

11
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:25,695
You want to be
my second-in-command,

12
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:27,097
prove you're ready.

13
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:29,199
When you find him,
say "Poughkeepsie."

14
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:30,734
Poughkeepsie.

15
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:32,636
It's our go word. It means
"drop everything and run."

16
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:35,105
Take control, Sam!
Cast him out!

17
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:37,274
Metatron made Gadreel
kill Kevin.

18
00:00:37,276 --> 00:00:39,676
It would explain a lot.

19
00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:41,111
No. Do it!

20
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:42,379
Kill me!!

21
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:43,747
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

22
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:45,282
Well,
you can sit here and rot.

23
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:47,684
Was the Winchesters grabbing me
part of your plan?

24
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:49,586
That was a surprise.

25
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:51,288
But I know something
they don't know --

26
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,156
the ending.

27
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:56,426
Abaddon. She's a demon...

28
00:00:56,428 --> 00:00:57,594
Who is a Knight of Hell.

29
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:59,329
Do you know what I find
the most shocking

30
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:00,897
about time-traveling
through a closet?

31
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,299
Somebody thought
it was a good idea

32
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:04,468
to make you
the king of Hell.

33
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,503
I am your k--

34
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,705
You and I are gonna talk about
a regime change.

35
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:10,574
A devil's trap
carved into the bullet.

36
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:12,342
It's gonna keep you
from smoking out.

37
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:17,080
The Knights of Hell
aren't exactly the dying kind.

38
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:19,549
But there is <i>something</i>
that can kill a knight.

39
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:20,851
The First Blade.

40
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:22,285
It's the bloody mark
of Cain.

41
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:24,888
Without the mark,
the blade is useless.

42
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,256
The mark can be transferred
to someone who's worthy.

43
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:29,126
But you have to know, with
the mark comes a great burden.

44
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:31,695
They're seeing hellhounds,
demonic pit bulls.

45
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:35,398
You can control them?

46
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,367
Sic him, boy!

47
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:38,401
Look at you.
You're a mess.

48
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:40,537
It's your DNA.

49
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:42,606
It's my addiction,

50
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:44,040
it makes you needy.

51
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:47,010
She reported everything I did
back to Abaddon.

52
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:19,176
What's that, you say?

53
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:21,044
"Come in"?

54
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:23,079
Don't mind if I do.

55
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:25,048
Who are you?

56
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,516
What do you want?

57
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:28,185
I'm a friend
of the family.

58
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:29,719
And I want you.

59
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:32,422
I have no idea
who you are.

60
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:35,859
But you'll be takin'
your leave now. Thank you.

61
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:38,695
Yes. You're packing.

62
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:41,464
Sailing for the colonies.

63
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:43,433
I know all about it.

64
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:45,135
Change of plans.

65
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:50,040
Ooh.

66
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,242
What's this, then?

67
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:54,311
Are we having a party?

68
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:58,815
Yes.

69
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:01,184
A farewell party.

70
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:12,796
Kah-nee-lah,
poo-goh,

71
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:15,265
kah-nee-lah!

72
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:24,695
<font color=#00FF00>? Supernatural 9x21 ?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>King of the Damned</font>
Original Air Date on May 6, 2014

73
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:29,696

74
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:33,048
She has a big slice of pizza
in her hand

75
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,783
we just got from the place
around the corner,

76
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:36,185
And a seagull
landed on her head

77
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:37,953
and started flapping
and distracted her

78
00:03:37,955 --> 00:03:40,422
while another seagull swooped in.
Oh, I can't tell you how great it feels

79
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:42,491
to finally have a night off,
right, guys?

80
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:48,183
Uh, this other seagull came --

81
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,029
Get away from all the pressure,
you know?

82
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:53,402
A-anyways, so,
no one had any pizza after that.

83
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:56,472
'Course, I can't really complain...
You just see the bird...

84
00:03:56,474 --> 00:03:58,440
being handpicked
by the big man himself.

85
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:01,610
I'm not really supposed to
talk about it.

86
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,613
'Cause it's Metatron.

87
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:07,883
What about Metatron?

88
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:12,554
Well, uh...
He's come to depend on me.

89
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:15,024
So, you know,
we're...tight.

90
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:16,425
And I have to say,

91
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:20,029
I've come to appreciate
the Met-man's vision.

92
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:21,997
His vision?

93
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,866
He threw us all
out of heaven!

94
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:25,567
No, no, no, no.
Big picture.

95
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,503
He's giving the place
a makeover,

96
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:29,405
bringing back
the chosen few,

97
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:31,974
starting with
the, uh, <i>chosen</i> chosen few,

98
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:33,942
if you, uh, know
what I mean.

99
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:18,754
These are
dangerous times.

100
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,357
You have to be careful
what you say.

101
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:23,158
You never know
who might be listening.

102
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,394
I said nothing.

103
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:26,762
Oh, you said plenty.

104
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:28,697
Apparently,
you felt the need

105
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,599
to discuss your relationship
with Metatron --

106
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,234
his strategies...
No.

107
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:33,769
...privileged information.

108
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:38,340
You speak that freely,
and there are consequences,

109
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:40,743
as you're about
to find out.

110
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,352
Is that...him?

111
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:52,755
It is.

112
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:17,346
- This is the address?
- Yeah.

113
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,653
If you'll follow me,
the commander will see you now.

114
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:26,288
The commander?

115
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:55,184
Sir.

116
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:09,798
Um...dismissed.

117
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:14,036
He can be a little stuffy.

118
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:16,405
So...Commander?

119
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:18,807
Yeah, not my idea.

120
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:21,877
They had no leader, and
they insisted on following me.

121
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,779
Yeah. No, we get it.
You're a rock star.

122
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:26,114
Bartholomew is dead.

123
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:28,116
Malachi was murdered
by Gadreel,

124
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:30,319
and with Metatron as powerful
as he is now,

125
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:32,087
I needed to do something.

126
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,489
So this war
between angels

127
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:35,057
is really gonna happen,
huh?

128
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:37,226
Not if I can find
a diplomatic option

129
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:39,061
for getting rid
of Metatron.

130
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:41,563
Good luck with that.

131
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:47,135
Dean, this angel-on-angel
violence -- it has to end.

132
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:49,338
Someone has to say,
"enough."

133
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:51,540
And that someone is you?

134
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:55,477
That brings me to
why you're here.

135
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,246
We have a prisoner.

136
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:59,815
It's an angel
from Metatron's inner circle.

137
00:07:59,817 --> 00:08:02,017
I need to know
what they're planning,

138
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,753
but so far,
he's revealed nothing.

139
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:06,522
So, you're done
with the rough stuff,

140
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:08,290
and you want us
to be your goons?

141
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:11,960
Well, you've had success
at these situations before.

142
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,498
If you don't want to do it,
I understand.

143
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,501
Who says
I don't want to do it?

144
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:26,208
So, here's the thing,
boys and girls --

145
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,143
we have a crisis.

146
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:31,280
Admittedly,
a crisis of my own making.

147
00:08:31,282 --> 00:08:33,215
In my extended absence,

148
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:36,652
where I handled
sensitive matters of state,

149
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:39,588
Abaddon made inroads
into my following,

150
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,890
creating chaos.

151
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:45,494
So I look to you,
my trusted advisors,

152
00:08:45,496 --> 00:08:48,196
to restore confidence,

153
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:51,466
to soothe
those jangled nerves.

154
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:54,670
Spread the word --
the king is back,

155
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:59,641
and the kingdom is once again
on sound footing.

156
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:03,912
So, all those with me,
say "yo!"

157
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:12,921
Yo!

158
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,462
I mean, I'm literally with you,
not <i>with you</i> with you.

159
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:22,397
You betrayed me?

160
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,967
No one in the history
of torture's

161
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:26,668
been tortured with torture

162
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,538
like the torture
you'll be tortured with.

163
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,707
Relax, everyone.
You did the new queen a solid.

164
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,942
You are sitting
at the popular kids' table.

165
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:36,244
Now, Crowley,
let's talk turkey.

166
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:38,914
I know you helped
the Winchesters

167
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:42,017
get their hands
on the First Blade, yes?

168
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:48,323
And I'm hearing that one of them
also has the mark of Cain --

169
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:51,026
all bad news,
since the Blade is the one thing

170
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:52,160
that can bring about
my --

171
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:54,529
Utter destruction.

172
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,233
To be indelicate.

173
00:09:58,235 --> 00:10:01,069
But here's the thing,
pet --

174
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:02,838
same goes for you.

175
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,039
And once I'm gone,

176
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,309
who do you think's next
on those cute boys' list?

177
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:11,046
That's right.

178
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:13,248
So let's get real.

179
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,584
Join me in taking out
the Winchesters

180
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:17,152
and that
ridiculous Blade,

181
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:20,088
and <i>then</i> we'll deal
with each other.

182
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:24,760
To be clear...

183
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:27,262
I'll not be
joining you ever.

184
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:30,232
Except at
your death scene,

185
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:32,267
where I shall
burst into song.

186
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,203
Goodbye.
You have no hold over me.

187
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:37,506
Oh, no?

188
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:42,544
Gavin, honey,
say hello to daddy.

189
00:10:42,546 --> 00:10:46,648
How did you --
I know a spell or two, Crowley.

190
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,551
Are you mad?

191
00:10:49,553 --> 00:10:52,621
This is your big card?

192
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:54,956
The boy and I loathe
each other.

193
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,159
I made it clear
in the past --

194
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:59,461
I don't care what happens
to the little bugger.

195
00:10:59,463 --> 00:11:01,396
No.

196
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:03,432
But that was before...

197
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:05,834
Wasn't it?

198
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:08,303
See, I know all about
your little problem --

199
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:10,238
bingeing on blood,

200
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,507
going right to the edge
of being human --

201
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:14,710
all of those
human feelings.

202
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:16,478
I'm clean.

203
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,346
And I'm willing to bet

204
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:21,149
that there's a smidgen
of humanity in there somewhere.

205
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:23,618
Not a chance.

206
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:34,229
I'm blind!

207
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:46,235
Help! I beg you!

208
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:51,307
You know these ghoulish
party tricks don't impress.

209
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:54,310
Seen worse, done worse.

210
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:55,578
No!
Uh-huh.

211
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,380
Please!

212
00:11:57,382 --> 00:12:00,416
Aah!

213
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:03,652
You're playing
a weak hand, Red!

214
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:12,762
I beg you!

215
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:15,231
You've made your point.

216
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,832
Now stop.

217
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:19,969
Sure.

218
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:25,007
You're wasting your time.
I have nothing to say.

219
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,443
We disagree.

220
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,045
There's no use torturing me.
I am a trained commando.

221
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:31,714
It won't work.

222
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:33,449
Wow.

223
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:35,384
Well, you just asked me
to dance.

224
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:37,453
Dean! Dean!

225
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:50,065
He won't be telling us
anything dead.

226
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,041
Besides, you know, I'm --
I'm really starting to realize

227
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:00,709
that he probably doesn't know
anything.

228
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:02,678
He was probably just pretending
at the bar.

229
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,413
Most likely,
he's a nobody.

230
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:05,815
I mean, do the math.

231
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:09,351
Ezra here is
one of Metatron's elite posse?

232
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:10,786
Really?

233
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:13,022
One of Metatron's most trusted

234
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:14,890
is, uh -- is hanging out at
bars, blabbing about the boss.

235
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:16,492
Does that make any sense?

236
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:19,962
Well, only if Metatron is purposely
surrounding himself with losers.

237
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:21,497
Exactly! Right?
Yeah.

238
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:23,833
What's this guy even doing here?
He's a wannabe.

239
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:25,234
I mean,
if he was a key player,

240
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:26,802
he would be up in heaven
with Metatron

241
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,704
where all the action is.
Exactly.

242
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:30,406
What if I'm a decoy?

243
00:13:32,008 --> 00:13:33,676
Or in deep cover?

244
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:36,812
Uh,
I-it's pathetic.

245
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,391
Mm, probably hasn't
even been to heaven,

246
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,316
not since the fall.
Of course not!

247
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,317
Yes, I have.

248
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,586
Buddy,
the gates are sealed.

249
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:44,854
No one can get in.

250
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:46,288
Who said anything
about gates?

251
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,824
You don't need gates
when you have a private portal.

252
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:51,827
Right.

253
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:53,229
If there was
a doorway on earth,

254
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:55,353
the angels
would've sensed it.

255
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:56,335
Yeah, you can't hide
something like that.

256
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,389
No.

257
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,190
You can if it moves around
from place to place,

258
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:03,327
if it's wherever
the boss wants it to be.

259
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:08,332
You are not my father.

260
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:12,269
My father was Fergus MacLeod,
a simple tailor.

261
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:15,306
A drunk, a monster.

262
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:17,107
Sounds about right.

263
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,942
He looked nothing
like you,

264
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:20,611
and I buried him.

265
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:23,947
A lot can change
in 291 years.

266
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:26,150
What?

267
00:14:44,402 --> 00:14:46,403
Can you cook a pigeon
on it?

268
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:49,573
Not terribly quick,
is he?

269
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:57,815
Holy mother of God!

270
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:01,652
We're amongst the stars!

271
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:05,289
Are we in heaven,
then?

272
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,957
You must be angels!

273
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,426
Wow. Wow.

274
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:11,228
I see. I got it.

275
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,565
So, you heard a rumor about
Metatron's "secret portal",

276
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,633
and you decided
to run with it.

277
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:18,969
It's not a rumor.
He showed me.

278
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:21,505
I get it. He's a fan.

279
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:23,374
A fan. Yeah.
You're a fan.

280
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:25,342
Just 'cause you're hot
for Metatron...

281
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:28,812
...or Bieber
or Beckham...

282
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:30,748
Just 'cause you know
everything about them

283
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,517
doesn't mean
that you actually <i>know</i> them.

284
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,053
Or that they even know you exist.
Ooh, that's cold, Sammy.

285
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:37,554
I'm just sayin', man.

286
00:15:37,556 --> 00:15:41,325
I was interviewed personally
by Metatron for a key post.

287
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:42,559
Yeah?

288
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:45,295
Oh, wow. Well, then --
then maybe you can tell me

289
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:47,331
why you weren't
at your key post

290
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,067
and you were hanging
down here instead.

291
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,605
Mm.
Now, that blows.

292
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:56,306
He got passed over.
Yeah.

293
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:58,609
I-I was a finalist.
Oh, man.

294
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:00,911
To get so close and
then get kicked downstairs.

295
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:02,546
It sucks to be you.

296
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:04,448
Hardly anybody
was chosen!

297
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,184
And ground forces is still
a very important assignment.

298
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:10,621
It was an honor to have even
been considered for the squad.

299
00:16:10,623 --> 00:16:12,022
What "squad"?
There is no squad.

300
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:14,124
Yeah, says you.
It's a highly guarded secret.

301
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:15,092
Oh.

302
00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:17,895
And what you be doing,
exactly?

303
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:23,934
No?

304
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:27,304
Wait a second.
Just, please, uh...

305
00:16:27,306 --> 00:16:29,540
Clarify this for me.

306
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:32,543
You desperately wanted
this job,

307
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:35,479
but you didn't know
what it was?

308
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:39,049
Well,
until you were chosen,

309
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:41,585
the exact nature of the mission
was kept a secret.

310
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:43,720
Wow.
Wow.

311
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:45,923
And...
Hardly anyone was chosen.

312
00:16:49,962 --> 00:16:51,829
Dim bulb.
No wonder he got bumped.

313
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:53,030
Yeah.

314
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:55,132
"Ground forces"?
"Elite secret squad"?

315
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:56,800
What's Metatron
gearing up for?

316
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:58,435
I don't know --
why don't we shove somebody

317
00:16:58,437 --> 00:17:00,070
through the back door of heaven
and find out.

318
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:01,905
Oh, wait. No.

319
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:03,507
It's portable
and can't be found.

320
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:06,243
You sold your soul?!

321
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:08,278
Sold it?!

322
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,547
For an extra three inches
of Willy?!

323
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:11,849
Priorities change.

324
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:14,818
I wasn't the bon vivant
that I am now.

325
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:18,288
I'll simplify --

326
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,592
my soul did a stint in hell,
where it became demonized.

327
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:23,227
Then I had to possess
another person

328
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:25,562
so I could traffic
with the living.

329
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:28,632
Any of this sticking?

330
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:31,502
I-I can't be
consorting with a demon!

331
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:34,738
Not just any demon.
I'm the king -- the king of Hell!

332
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,543
And there you were,

333
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:42,012
worried the old man
wouldn't amount to much.

334
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:12,332
It's unbelievable.

335
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:14,067
I mean, he was fine
when we left him.

336
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:15,936
I barely touched
the guy.

337
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:18,872
Still shackled, no weapon.
It wasn't suicide.

338
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:20,207
No.

339
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,309
This was an angel kill.

340
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,545
Okay.
Well, I'm gonna say it.

341
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:27,214
Maybe your operation's
been hacked.

342
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:29,416
You know, Metatron's got
somebody on the inside.

343
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:33,086
I was sure everyone here
was loyal.

344
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:37,124
Finally united
by a common cause.

345
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:39,793
Well,
that's the problem.

346
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:41,829
See, you don't think
anybody's lying.

347
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:43,697
I think
everybody's lying.

348
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:47,034
It's a gift.

349
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,704
Let's do
some nosin' around.

350
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,276
Sam.

351
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:58,612
You have a moment?

352
00:18:58,614 --> 00:19:00,514
Yeah. What?

353
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,549
I wanted to ask you
about Gadreel,

354
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:04,952
the time he possessed you.

355
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,088
It's not really
something I like to --

356
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,424
Sam, please.

357
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:17,431
He didn't possess me
completely --

358
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:20,234
more like we, uh...
shared housing.

359
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:21,835
I was still me.

360
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:24,338
Did you ever sense
a presence?

361
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:29,176
I don't really know
what I felt.

362
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:32,145
I mean, maybe that I wasn't
completely alone.

363
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:34,047
Did you ever feel
threatened?

364
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,118
No.

365
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,587
More that he...

366
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:44,258
wasn't at rest, l-like he had
unfinished business.

367
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,760
Now that we know
more about him,

368
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:49,696
I-I'd say he felt
misunderstood.

369
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:54,868
But not -- not a danger,
not hostile.

370
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:58,405
No.

371
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:03,310
I was wrong, obviously.

372
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:05,479
He killed Kevin.

373
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:18,625
"Why do I hate you"?!

374
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:22,996
I mean, I beat you,
starved you,

375
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:25,131
came home drunk,

376
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:27,067
beat you some more,

377
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:29,069
woke up hungover,

378
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:31,938
and, yeah, I beat you.

379
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,307
In all fairness, I didn't
really have any role models.

380
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:36,009
My mother was a witch!

381
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:39,512
I grew up thinkin' --
knowin' I was nothin'.

382
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:41,081
Less than nothin'!

383
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,749
You worked me harder
than the horse!

384
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:44,384
You never let me
go to school.

385
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:46,119
To this day,
I can't read!

386
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,421
It's overrated.

387
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:50,957
Most of Europe
couldn't read.

388
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,959
You want to read?

389
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:55,428
Read.

390
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:03,336
Some Buccaneers beat
the Saints?

391
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:05,638
Can this be?

392
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:10,977
I can read.

393
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,846
King of Hell.

394
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:14,881
Plenty of perks.

395
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,017
So...

396
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,120
If you're a king...

397
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:22,388
that would make me...

398
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,023
Prince?

399
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:26,059
And you say I've never
given you anything.

400
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:27,594
A title!

401
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:33,566
And if I was to accept you
as my father,

402
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,270
you could keep me from
eternally burning in hell?

403
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,773
No matter my sins?

404
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:42,775
You're negotiating
with me?

405
00:21:42,777 --> 00:21:45,278
That's my boy.

406
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:48,715
This might work out.

407
00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:52,252
For the first time
in my entire life,

408
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:56,356
I can see possibilities,
a future...

409
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,124
Just as soon as you
take me back to my own time

410
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:00,527
and I can board that ship
for the new world.

411
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,130
Uh,
about that ship...

412
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:06,499
What about the ship?

413
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,240
It's not important.

414
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:16,776
You can tell Abaddon
I'm ready for that chat.

415
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:27,754
Thank you
for coming.

416
00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:31,424
And thank you
for coming alone.

417
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:34,594
I've seen you through
Sam Winchester's eyes,

418
00:22:34,596 --> 00:22:36,596
and he trusts you.

419
00:22:36,598 --> 00:22:38,998
You have a reputation
for honor.

420
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,434
In some circles.

421
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:45,738
As for reputations,
yours precedes you.

422
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,075
What happened in the Garden
was not my doing.

423
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,177
I know you feel
misunderstood.

424
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,448
And you're eager to redeem
yourself and maybe more.

425
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,288
You refer to my support

426
00:22:57,313 --> 00:22:59,333
of Metatron's campaign
to rebuild heaven?

427
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:00,887
Your support?

428
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:04,090
You've recruited for him,
you've killed for him.

429
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:08,228
And I know you truly believe
it's for the greater good,

430
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,230
but you've placed your faith
in the wrong master.

431
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:11,864
You don't know him.

432
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:13,933
I know him too well,
Gadreel!

433
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:16,035
I made the same mistake,
and it led to the fall.

434
00:23:16,037 --> 00:23:17,737
Which led to
my second chance.

435
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:19,606
This is about more
than just you.

436
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:22,375
Castiel, are you suggesting
I change loyalties?

437
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:24,978
I'm suggesting you reclaim
your original loyalty --

438
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,580
to the heaven and mission
we were made to serve.

439
00:23:27,582 --> 00:23:29,882
I thought that was
exactly what I was doing.

440
00:23:30,818 --> 00:23:32,385
You've been deceived.

441
00:23:32,387 --> 00:23:34,487
And as bad
as you've had it,

442
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:36,789
all those centuries
locked away,

443
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,393
it will be much worse
under Metatron.

444
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:45,298
Castiel!

445
00:23:58,747 --> 00:24:00,013
Aah!

446
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,225
Give me your hand.

447
00:24:14,862 --> 00:24:16,262
That's it.

448
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:27,240
Drop the Blade, Dean.

449
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:29,342
Dean!

450
00:24:30,712 --> 00:24:32,845
Dean.

451
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,314
Dean.

452
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,983
What's wrong with you?
You hear your phone?

453
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:40,253
It's about time.
Where the hell have you been?

454
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:42,989
I told you I'd be in touch
when I'd found Abaddon.

455
00:24:42,991 --> 00:24:44,324
Well...

456
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:45,792
I'm in touch.

457
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:47,660
Where are you?

458
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:49,262
First things first.

459
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:51,397
I'll give you the location
of the First Blade.

460
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:55,068
You two fetch it,
I'll keep her in my sights,

461
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,172
then we'll remove her
from the payroll for good.

462
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:23,883
Oh!
Come on, Crowley!

463
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:27,453
You really, uh, uh, have to
hide the Blade in a corpse?

464
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:30,856
Not -- not <i>with</i> a corpse
but <i>in</i> a corpse?

465
00:25:30,858 --> 00:25:33,159
I got to say, it's not
the first place I'd look.

466
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:36,061
All right, here we go.

467
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,133
Dean?

468
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:42,902
Do you hear that?

469
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,542
I'm guessing Hellhound.

470
00:25:50,912 --> 00:25:52,077
Go. Go!

471
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:08,928
Oh.

472
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,863
Hello?

473
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:13,465
Damn it, Crowley,
the grave is guarded!

474
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:14,967
That's absurd.

475
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:16,802
A Hellhound!

476
00:26:16,804 --> 00:26:18,737
No, no, no,
she was collected.

477
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:21,173
The hell she was!
Guys!

478
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:22,975
Time was, no one would dare
disobey the king.

479
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:24,443
Guys!

480
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:27,213
I'm gonna put you
on speaker!

481
00:26:28,616 --> 00:26:29,848
Juliet?

482
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,450
It's papa.

483
00:26:31,452 --> 00:26:34,053
Stand down.

484
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,559
You're welcome.

485
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:12,791
All right.

486
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:14,426
Goin' in.

487
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:16,528
Hey, you know what?
Maybe, uh...

488
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,897
Maybe I should do this.

489
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:20,132
Sam, it's fine.

490
00:27:20,134 --> 00:27:23,502
I -- I-I can safely grab it
without...you know...

491
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:40,586
Pbht.

492
00:27:40,588 --> 00:27:42,305
Well, let's go kill
a knight of hell, huh?

493
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:44,169
Yeah.

494
00:27:45,258 --> 00:27:47,192
What're you talking about?

495
00:27:47,194 --> 00:27:48,661
Of course I'm boardin' the ship
when I go back!

496
00:27:48,663 --> 00:27:50,396
I want to go back
to my life!

497
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:52,264
It's not a good idea.

498
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:54,600
I'm going to the colonies.
I'm workin' my way across.

499
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:56,302
I've given my word!

500
00:27:56,304 --> 00:27:58,270
Gavin,
listen to your father.

501
00:27:58,272 --> 00:28:00,239
I know what's...

502
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:03,542
...best for you.

503
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:07,546
Kids.

504
00:28:09,316 --> 00:28:11,150
Squirrel.

505
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:13,419
I hope you were nice
to your father.

506
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:15,521
What? Shut up.

507
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:16,789
Look, we got the Blade.

508
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:17,823
You do?

509
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:20,092
Well, you need to
get it here at once.

510
00:28:20,094 --> 00:28:22,227
Cleveland,
Humboldt Hotel.

511
00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:23,729
Penthouse, of course.

512
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:26,298
When you get here,
I'll take you to Abaddon.

513
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,133
I'll draw her out,

514
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:32,471
and then you can skewer
the ignorant hag.

515
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,174
Just selling it.

516
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:36,709
All right,
we're on our way.

517
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:38,711
Oh, and, Dean,
you need to get a move on.

518
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:40,646
It's a good day's drive
from Poughkeepsie.

519
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:43,182
What are you talking about?
We're not even near there.

520
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:44,817
Yeah, like I said,

521
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:46,885
you need to leave Poughkeepsie
right away.

522
00:28:49,622 --> 00:28:51,390
So, we good?

523
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:54,893
Yeah.

524
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:03,369
Nice.

525
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:04,703
But here's the thing --

526
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:07,840
you've been plotting with
those boys for some time now.

527
00:29:07,842 --> 00:29:10,109
When they get here,
it'll be you,

528
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:12,644
the Winchesters,
the First Blade,

529
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:16,515
and little, old me
in one place.

530
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:18,517
Now,
I don't mind stiff odds,

531
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,753
but...

532
00:29:20,755 --> 00:29:22,354
...let's be reasonable.

533
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:27,393
Aah!

534
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:29,695
You lost your mind?!

535
00:29:31,132 --> 00:29:33,632
Little trick I learned
from Henry Winchester.

536
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:35,501
He pulled
the same stunt on me.

537
00:29:35,503 --> 00:29:38,537
I had a devil's trap
carved in the bullet.

538
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:40,973
You're not
seriously damaged,

539
00:29:40,975 --> 00:29:43,876
just...powerless.

540
00:29:46,546 --> 00:29:48,714
I had nothing
to do with it.

541
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:50,816
I never would have
agreed to meet

542
00:29:50,818 --> 00:29:52,551
if I thought
concealed assassins

543
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:54,386
were going to try
and attack you.

544
00:29:54,388 --> 00:29:56,555
I hope you know that.

545
00:29:57,857 --> 00:30:00,325
Why are you
telling me this?

546
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:03,862
Even though you and I are on
opposite sides in this situation,

547
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:07,733
I believe there must be honor,
even in matters of war.

548
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:11,136
But what happened -- doesn't it
prove my point about Metatron?

549
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:13,138
You met with me
in good faith,

550
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,842
but he lied,
and he used you to get at me.

551
00:30:16,844 --> 00:30:18,177
Castiel --

552
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:22,181
Just as poor judgement undid you
all those centuries ago,

553
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:25,818
your mistaken trust in Metatron
will bring you down again.

554
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,053
I gave him my word.

555
00:30:28,055 --> 00:30:30,522
Do you expect me
to come make war on him?

556
00:30:30,524 --> 00:30:33,125
No. Not at all.

557
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:36,662
I want you to stay
right where you are.

558
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:39,832
Just give me reports
on what Metatron is planning

559
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:42,301
and when he will strike.

560
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:45,737
And the honor we were
speaking of?

561
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:49,408
Obviously, Metatron has someone
inside my camp.

562
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,410
It's how he knew
we were meeting.

563
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:54,046
Just fighting fire
with fire.

564
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:57,916
Consider my offer.

565
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:17,669
All right.
Let's do this.

566
00:31:17,671 --> 00:31:19,771
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a sec.

567
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:22,841
We should give this place a
once-over before we go up there.

568
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:25,244
Okay. Why?

569
00:31:25,246 --> 00:31:28,146
Crowley said he thought he saw some
demons headed down to the basement.

570
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:29,615
He'd have checked it out
himself,

571
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,950
but if word got back to Abaddon
that he'd been seen...

572
00:31:31,952 --> 00:31:35,053
When did he say all this?
On the phone.

573
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:37,022
Look, it might mean that
she knows that he's here, okay?

574
00:31:37,024 --> 00:31:38,690
So why don't you
check out the basement.

575
00:31:38,692 --> 00:31:40,659
I'll, uh, take a look
on the main floor.

576
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:54,873
Hello, Dean.

577
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:59,378
Love the crazy bloodlust
in your eyes.

578
00:32:03,783 --> 00:32:06,051
Let's not waste time.

579
00:32:06,053 --> 00:32:08,220
I'll take you to Abaddon.

580
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,891
It's not far.

581
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:26,638
A boy and his Blade.

582
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,908
And still no match
for the new queen.

583
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:51,930
So, first...

584
00:32:51,932 --> 00:32:53,832
You'll die...

585
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:55,434
Painfully.

586
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:59,071
And then Crowley will watch
his son die --

587
00:33:00,974 --> 00:33:02,441
ditto --

588
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:05,143
and then the king himself.

589
00:33:05,145 --> 00:33:07,145
And Blade destroyed.

590
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:10,682
That's quite
a to-do list.

591
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:50,749
Dean.

592
00:34:54,454 --> 00:34:55,921
Dean!

593
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,560
Dean! Stop!

594
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,764
You can stop.

595
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:36,708
You could at least --
aah! --

596
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,643
help me with this.

597
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:42,046
We didn't kill you,
Crowley,

598
00:35:42,048 --> 00:35:44,048
even though it would've
been very easy.

599
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,784
Isn't that enough?

600
00:35:45,786 --> 00:35:47,552
You owe me.

601
00:35:47,554 --> 00:35:50,588
Do I get no credit
for warning you this was a trap?

602
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,658
"Poughkeepsie"
ring a bell?

603
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:04,903
I sense drama.

604
00:36:07,173 --> 00:36:10,008
I just still can't get over
the fact that Crowley has a son.

605
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,410
How's he doing,
by the way?

606
00:36:12,412 --> 00:36:13,912
Ow!

607
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,981
How do you think?

608
00:36:18,617 --> 00:36:20,652
You get that he's got
to go back, right?

609
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:22,520
To his own time?

610
00:36:22,522 --> 00:36:24,022
If the lad goes back,

611
00:36:24,024 --> 00:36:27,358
his destiny is to board
a ship bound for America.

612
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,527
That ship went down
in a storm.

613
00:36:29,529 --> 00:36:31,095
All hands were lost.

614
00:36:31,097 --> 00:36:35,600
He had one chance in this world
to change his life.

615
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:39,337
You want that
to all end in tragedy?

616
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:42,807
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

617
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,609
Them's the rules.
He goes back.

618
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:46,744
The lore all says
the same thing --

619
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,981
you change any one thing
in the past,

620
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:53,451
the ripple effect impacts
everything that follows.

621
00:36:53,453 --> 00:36:55,053
Please.

622
00:36:55,055 --> 00:36:58,223
No one bends the rules like
you two bend the rules.

623
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:01,392
He's one misfit kid.
He impacts no one.

624
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:03,928
You don't bend that rule,
okay? You don't.

625
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,397
We'll take him back to the
bunker, figure out the spell.

626
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:08,166
That's the way
it's got to be.

627
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:11,336
Can I at least
say goodbye?

628
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,713
I'll cheer the day

629
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:25,416
when the last trace of humanity
leaves me.

630
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:27,352
<i>Feelings.</i>

631
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:45,403
Damn it, Crowley!

632
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:48,273
The ship went down?

633
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:53,278
Well, that's a good fit
with the rest of my life.

634
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,014
Mustn't snivel, Gavin.

635
00:37:56,016 --> 00:37:59,884
It might fit the old life.
This one could be different.

636
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:02,554
I don't know the first thing
about the 21st Century!

637
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:03,988
You'll be fine.

638
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,891
Just avoid cheap whiskey
and cheap hookers.

639
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:11,696
Look at me,
getting all fatherly.

640
00:38:13,098 --> 00:38:15,133
So this is goodbye,
then?

641
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:18,436
Yes. Forever.

642
00:38:18,438 --> 00:38:21,606
Unless, of course,
I catch you smoking,

643
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:25,009
in which case,
I'll smack you stupid.

644
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,114
Goodbye, then.

645
00:38:30,116 --> 00:38:31,916
And thank you...

646
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:35,153
...father.
Whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.

647
00:38:35,155 --> 00:38:37,221
As you were.

648
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:41,326
Goodbye, Gavin.

649
00:38:41,328 --> 00:38:43,127
Oh, uh...

650
00:38:43,129 --> 00:38:48,199
Don't go mentioning that
whole "Prince of Hell" thing.

651
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,568
Doesn't play too well
in most circles.

652
00:38:58,912 --> 00:39:00,945
I didn't tell you
about the warning

653
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:03,114
because I knew
exactly what you would do.

654
00:39:03,116 --> 00:39:04,782
You would make sure

655
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:07,986
that you were right alongside me
going in that room.

656
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,855
You mean like
we always do?

657
00:39:10,857 --> 00:39:12,757
Because we're
actually partners in this

658
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:14,492
and we watch
each other's backs?

659
00:39:14,494 --> 00:39:16,361
I don't expect you
to understand.

660
00:39:16,363 --> 00:39:18,062
Try me.

661
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:29,941
First time I touched
that Blade...I knew.

662
00:39:29,943 --> 00:39:32,777
I knew that I wouldn't
be stopped.

663
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,916
I knew
I would take down Abaddon

664
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,552
and anything else
if I had to.

665
00:39:41,554 --> 00:39:43,421
And it wasn't
a hero thing.

666
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,590
You know, it wasn't...

667
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,994
It was just calm.

668
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,666
I knew.

669
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:57,635
And I had to
go it alone, Sammy.

670
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,440
Oh. Of course.

671
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,176
So it was just another time
where you had to protect me.

672
00:40:05,178 --> 00:40:06,811
You could've gotten
nabbed by Abaddon,

673
00:40:06,813 --> 00:40:08,713
and she could've
bargained her way out.

674
00:40:09,982 --> 00:40:12,350
We couldn't afford
to screw this up.

675
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,291
Look...

676
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,493
I'm glad it worked out,
okay? I am.

677
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:25,530
And I'm glad the Blade gives you
strength or calm or whatever,

678
00:40:25,532 --> 00:40:28,833
but, Dean,
I got to say...

679
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:32,203
I'm starting to think the Blade
is doing something else, too.

680
00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:35,339
Yeah? Like what?

681
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:38,743
I don't know.
Like, something to <i>you.</i>

682
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:41,579
Look...

683
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:44,449
I'm thinking
until we know for sure

684
00:40:44,451 --> 00:40:47,318
that we're gonna
kill off Crowley,

685
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,121
why don't we store the Blade
somewhere distant?

686
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:52,156
Lock it up
somewhere safe?

687
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,858
Okay?

688
00:40:56,161 --> 00:40:58,196
No.
