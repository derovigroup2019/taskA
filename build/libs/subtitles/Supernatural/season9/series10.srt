1
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:05,736
You're dying, sam.

2
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:06,522
Shut up.

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,445
Ezekiel, he's a good soldier.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,851
There is a chance I can fix
your brother from the inside.

5
00:00:10,876 --> 00:00:12,168
I'm trusting you, Zeke.

6
00:00:12,193 --> 00:00:14,202
Metatron tricked me.
He took my Grace.

7
00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:15,284
It's why I'm human.

8
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:17,102
There's no putting
the angels back in Heaven.

9
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:18,353
Heaven is locked.

10
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:20,605
Damn it, Cass! There's a war on,
and it's on you.

11
00:00:20,607 --> 00:00:23,108
I know who you are,
and it isn't Ezekiel.

12
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,225
Gadreel.

13
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:26,344
You intend to be the ruler
of this new heaven.

14
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:28,480
I will join you
as second in command.

15
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:30,698
Here's the first name
on your to-do list.

16
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:33,684
My name is Abaddon.
War is what I do. It's my job.

17
00:00:33,686 --> 00:00:36,121
I can get you new bodies,
and we will march into hell,

18
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:38,873
and all the humans and all
the angels will bow to me!

19
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,858
Angels are slaughtering
one another.

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,327
It's open warfare.

21
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:43,661
No one will survive this war.

22
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,965
I did what I had to.
I got my Grace back.

23
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:51,586
No! No, no!

24
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:56,841
Kevin.

25
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:28,923
? Think in terms
of bridges burned ?

26
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:36,014
? think of seasons
that must end ?

27
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:43,354
? see the rivers
rise and fall ?

28
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:51,196
? they will rise
and fall again ?

29
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:57,619
? everything must have an end

30
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:00,955
? like an ocean to a shore

31
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:04,492
? like a river to a stream

32
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:11,082
? as the light fades
from the screen ?

33
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,250
? from the famous final scene

Corey! Corey! Corey! Corey!

37
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:33,238
Corey! Corey!

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,322
You're on in 10.

39
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:36,107
The label wants to open
with "Baby, Be My Baby."

40
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:38,076
Then you can roll
right on into "Babycakes,"

41
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:40,178
and then the <i>clean</i> version
of "Babymaker."

42
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,529
Oh, and, Corey?

43
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:45,667
Let's try to take it easy
with the groupies tonight, huh?

44
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,252
Yeah, whatever.

45
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,289
The hell -- security!

46
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,374
It's fine, Margey.

47
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:54,992
You can go.

48
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:56,044
What? Corey --

49
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:57,795
Bitch, did I stutter?!

50
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,139
Hello, Gadreel.

51
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:09,307
Thaddeus.

52
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:11,059
That's a new look,
I must say.

53
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:12,977
Well, what can I say,
you know?

54
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:14,479
We all got booted
out of the penthouse,

55
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:16,681
and I just kind of figured...

56
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:18,933
Why be an angel
when you can be a God?

57
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:24,906
How are you, old friend?
I am not your friend.

58
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:28,743
Well, I think you're being
a little bit mean there,

59
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:30,878
considering all the quality time
we spent together.

60
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,215
I was imprisoned,
and you tortured me.

61
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:35,833
Heaven has rules.

62
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:37,919
Do the crime, do the time.
That's it.

63
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:39,837
I made a mistake.

64
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,888
I was a guard.

65
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,724
I was doing my job.

66
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:44,559
What you did to Abner,
was that was your job?

67
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,210
Your boyfriend?
Now, that, mnh --

68
00:03:46,212 --> 00:03:48,029
that was just fun.

69
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:52,817
Is that what you're here for --
the big payback?

70
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:54,552
Fine.

71
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:56,187
If you want to get
a little bloody,

72
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:59,240
uh, I have no problem
kicking your ass -- again.

73
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:02,277
You know, w-we'll say
for old time's sa--

74
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,447
Looking for this?

75
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,169
Gadreel...

76
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,457
...I'm sorry.

77
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:31,973
Dean.

78
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:34,392
Cass.

79
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:36,861
Now, look at you, all suited up
and back in the game.

80
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:40,231
I, um...

81
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,650
I came as soon
as you called.

82
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,819
I wa--

83
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:52,327
Dean, what happened?

84
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:53,461
What's wrong?

85
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:09,444
Sammy was dying.

86
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:10,728
What was I supposed to do?

87
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,530
You let an angel possess him?

88
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:15,216
He said it was the only way,
and I believed him.

89
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:18,419
Now Sam's gone.
Kevin's...

90
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:21,689
Dean, I'm sorry.

91
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:23,358
Yeah, well...

92
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,327
Sorry don't pay the bills,
does it?

93
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:29,664
It sure as hell
ain't gonna bring Kevin back.

94
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:36,437
We got to find
that son of a bitch.

95
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,839
Dean.

96
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:41,793
If the angel possessing Sam
isn't Ezekiel, then who is it?

97
00:05:44,463 --> 00:05:46,497
A dead man walking.

98
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:47,765
What,
you're gonna destroy him?

99
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,333
Damn right.

100
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:51,001
You kill an angel,
its vessel dies, too.

101
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:54,055
Think I don't know that?

102
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:57,058
If I don't end Sam

103
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,480
and that halo burns him out
and I...

104
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,870
God, I was so damn stupid.

105
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:13,257
You were stupid
for the right reasons.

106
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,625
Yeah, like that matters.

107
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:15,993
It does.

108
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:19,363
Sometimes that's all
that matters.

109
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:21,082
Listen to me.

110
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,817
Sam is strong.

111
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:25,553
If he knew an angel was
possessing him, he could fight.

112
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:27,638
He could cast
the angel out.

113
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,810
Maybe.

114
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:35,279
But as far as I know,
he's in the dark.

115
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,616
I don't know
how we clue him in.

116
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:41,803
Do you remember Alfie?

117
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:43,938
The kid angel?
Yeah. Why?

118
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,173
Before he died,

119
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:48,810
he told me the demons
were able to dig into his mind,

120
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:50,278
access his coding.

121
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,996
We might be able
to do that here.

122
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:53,114
Might be able to --

123
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:56,050
to bypass the angel
and talk directly to Sam.

124
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,201
And you think
that would work?

125
00:06:57,203 --> 00:06:59,687
I don't know,
but I think we should try.

126
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:02,340
Okay.
Um, where do we start?

127
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:15,419
Hello, boys.

128
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:17,922
Here's the deal --

129
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:20,158
you're gonna tell us
how to hack an angel,

130
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,443
and I'm gonna give you
some of the good stuff.

131
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:26,430
Human blood,
fresh from the tap.

132
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:28,583
Word is you're
jonesing for it.

133
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:29,734
Please. I'll pass.

134
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:31,135
What do you want, then?

135
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:34,005
Well, for starters...
A massage.

136
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:36,390
Between the sitting
and the shackles,

137
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:38,108
a body gets
a little stiff.

138
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,478
Yeah, I ain't rubbing you.
God, no.

139
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,946
Get Kevin.

140
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:45,883
His tiny fists can really work wonder--
Kevin is dead.

141
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:48,503
Oh.

142
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:53,257
I'm sorry to hear that.

143
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:55,476
Don't pretend you care.

144
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:56,694
You tried to kill him.

145
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:59,480
I told him
this was gonna happen.

146
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:02,717
I was the only person
who tried to warn him.

147
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:04,001
I told him to run.

148
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:05,169
From what?

149
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:06,337
You.

150
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,607
How many times
am I gonna have to say this?

151
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:12,243
People in your
general vicinity

152
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:15,329
don't have much in the way
of a life-span.

153
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:18,783
Now, I can't teach you
how to crack open an angel.

154
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:20,968
It's more...
art than science.

155
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,653
But I can do it for you.

156
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:26,757
All I ask in return
is a little field trip.

157
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,393
Dying for some fresh air.

158
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:31,262
Chains on, naturally.

159
00:08:31,264 --> 00:08:33,931
No

160
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,666
No? Of course not.

161
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:36,984
Because if I'm plan "A,"

162
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:40,855
I'm sure you have a totally
viable, much better plan "B."

163
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,116
You can't be
considering this.

164
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:53,918
With the chains on,
he can't do anything.

165
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,120
It's Crowley.
He can always do something.

166
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:58,823
Looks like we need
a tiebreaker.

167
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:00,858
Go get moose, squirrel.

168
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,747
Unless...

169
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:08,516
Unless, of course,
you can't.

170
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:11,235
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

171
00:09:11,237 --> 00:09:15,089
The poor giant baby's
in trouble again, isn't he?

172
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:18,042
Are you done?

173
00:09:18,044 --> 00:09:18,926
Depends.

174
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,378
Do we have a deal?

175
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,211
Yeah.

176
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:23,297
Excellent.
When do we leave?

177
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:26,450
Soon as I can scrounge up
a ride.

178
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:30,938
Well, I have a vehicle.

179
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,041
It stopped a few miles
from here, inexplicably.

180
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:58,082
Really?

181
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:00,751
What are you, a pimp?

182
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:02,687
I like it.

183
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:07,942
Yeah, it's out of gas.

184
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:10,311
Riddle me this, boy wonder.

185
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:11,996
Why do you need the wheels?

186
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:17,535
When you betray us, I'll be
the one to carve out your heart.

187
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:19,770
Oh, Cass, such a flirt.

188
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,458
All right. Let's go.

189
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,544
Shotgun.
Uh, wrong.

190
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:28,379
You're in the back.

191
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,617
Hey -- you, too.
Keep an eye on him.

192
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,393
Hey.

193
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:45,730
Watch the leg.
You're on my side.

194
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,648
Hey! Hey! Hey!

195
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:04,865
Get you anything else?
I'm good, thanks.

196
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,545
Welcome home, sweethearts.

197
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:22,666
Strange seeing an old vessel,
isn't it?

198
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:26,187
Like looking
in a funhouse mirror.

199
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:32,943
But first things first -- the
tasks I gave you, any hiccups?

200
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:35,596
Killing Thaddeus was easy.

201
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:36,981
He had it coming.

202
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:38,365
I know all about your history.

203
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,568
Why do you think
I gave you his name?

204
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:44,655
Consider it
your signing bonus.

205
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:45,906
And the kid?

206
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:49,126
That was...

207
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:50,745
less easy.

208
00:11:50,747 --> 00:11:52,196
He was a threat,

209
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:53,964
but I flipped
a switch upstairs,

210
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:58,869
and now that Kevin is gone,
there will be no more Prophets.

211
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:02,840
And what about
Dean Winchester?

212
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:07,077
You never gave me his name,
Metatron.

213
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,148
Not much for seizing
the initiative, are we?

214
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,403
Gadreel, we are writing
our own epic story here.

215
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:20,891
To make that work, sometimes
you have to kill your darlings.

216
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:22,793
It's not like you haven't done
worse before.

217
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:27,198
Sorry. Sorry.

218
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,750
Onto new business.

219
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:32,787
Your next target.

220
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,577
How many more lives
do I have to take?

221
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:45,099
It's not your place
to ask questions.

222
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:47,701
It is your place
to obey.

223
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:50,521
You want to be
my second in command?

224
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:52,206
Prove you're ready.

225
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,258
Prove you're loyal.

226
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:58,262
Or don't.

227
00:12:58,264 --> 00:12:59,446
Walk away.

228
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:03,818
Go back to being Gadreel
the traitor, the sap,

229
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,287
heaven's
longest-running joke.

230
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:24,672
<i>Inferni clamavi ad te regem.</i>

231
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:29,093
Abaddon?

232
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:32,646
I found him.

233
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:35,649
Crowley is on the move.

234
00:13:47,065 --> 00:13:48,933
AbnerYour source is in <i>here?</i>

235
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:51,152
And she can track
anything you need,

236
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:53,654
even our little
lost Samantha.

237
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:55,289
How?

238
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,192
Well, this place
isn't really...this.

239
00:13:58,194 --> 00:14:01,028
It's a front
for an N.S.A. listening post.

240
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,531
What are they listening for?
Everything.

241
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:06,450
The U.S. government
is quite the voyeur these days.

242
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:11,255
So I planted one of my best
and let her go to work.

243
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:14,658
Looking for terrorists?

244
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,844
Looking for marks,
slow boat.

245
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,662
Mr. Crowley?
She'll see you now.

246
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:21,715
Uh, just Mr. Crowley.

247
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:26,053
I'll be listening
to every word you say.

248
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:27,271
Promise?

249
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:33,594
Cecily.

250
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,129
How are you?

251
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:36,463
Better than you.

252
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:39,200
That was Dean Winchester,
and...Castiel?

253
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:40,301
Yes, I know.

254
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:43,470
Without the tie,
he's barely recognizable.

255
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:45,072
It's so --
hot.

256
00:14:45,074 --> 00:14:47,825
I mean, human Castiel?

257
00:14:47,827 --> 00:14:49,076
Eh.

258
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:50,661
But feathered Castiel?

259
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:52,963
<i>Human</i> Castiel?

260
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:54,665
You heard what happened
to him, right?

261
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:55,900
I've been tied up.

262
00:14:55,902 --> 00:14:57,635
Pray, do tell.

263
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:01,922
Hear anything?

264
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:04,542
No.

265
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:07,978
The room Crowley's in
has been warded.

266
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,998
Awesome.
That's friggin' awesome.

267
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,349
So captain sexy out there

268
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,418
totally cuts
another angel's throat,

269
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,353
yoinks his Grace, and now?

270
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:19,907
He's got his mojo back --
minus the broken wings.

271
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,325
Well, that explains
the hooptie.

272
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:23,944
And we know all this how?

273
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:26,864
I tuned one of our satellites
to pick up angel radio.

274
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:28,365
Impressive.

275
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,333
Yeah.

276
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:30,868
Not just a pretty face.

277
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,785
What about Hell?

278
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:34,121
No one's doing their job.

279
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:35,906
I send oodles of data
down there every week,

280
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:37,374
but does Hell give a damn?

281
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:38,492
No.

282
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:41,478
Well. Of course.
With Abaddon in charge, you...?

283
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,597
Oh, that "b" with an "itch"
ain't the boss.

284
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:47,851
I mean, she's got a few of the
more aggro types on her side.

285
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:50,437
But most are just waiting
to see who takes the belt --

286
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:52,923
you or her.

287
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:55,309
They're still afraid of me.

288
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:57,144
Probably 'cause they don't know
you're in cuffs.

289
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:59,863
Speaking of which...

290
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:03,100
Do they come off?

291
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:04,451
Not without the key.

292
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:09,106
Fine.

293
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:11,625
I need you to do me a favor.

294
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:13,711
Can you find this car
for me?

295
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,446
Easy-peasy.

296
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:21,752
Nice to know
someone's still loyal.

297
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:24,021
Uh-huh.

298
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:31,362
That is, of course, if you're
not playing both sides?

299
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:37,067
Wouldn't you?

300
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:44,992
Your phallus on wheels
just ran a red light

301
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:48,746
in Somerset, Pennsylvania,
10 minutes ago.

302
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:50,147
Let's go.

303
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:53,534
The three amigos ride again.

304
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:56,136
He's not <i>my</i> amigo.

305
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:22,312
Alexander Sarver?
Yeah?

306
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:31,521
Gadreel?

307
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:32,823
Abner?

308
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:34,408
I thought you were dead.

309
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,110
W-what happened?

310
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:37,411
W-what are you doing here?

311
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:38,996
I --

312
00:17:38,998 --> 00:17:40,130
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

313
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:41,548
Daddy! Daddy!

314
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,587
Hey.

315
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:49,423
Delilah,
this is daddy's best friend.

316
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:51,475
Can you say hi?

317
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:52,476
Hi.

318
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,446
You have a child?

319
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:57,231
I have family, Gadreel.

320
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:03,053
Look, my wife and the niblet
are going to a movie.

321
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:05,189
Swing back in a few hours
so we can catch up. Okay?

322
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:07,491
Okay. Sure.

323
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,569
So, um, you have a job?

324
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:22,039
Customer support --
computers mostly.

325
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:25,325
It's like answering prayers,
but they pay you for it.

326
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:27,911
You have changed, Abner.

327
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:31,465
Yeah, well,
I was a crappy angel.

328
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,884
I was petulant.

329
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:35,018
I deserted my post.

330
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,689
I spent 700 years
in heaven's lockup. I...

331
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:43,227
No.

332
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:44,661
Doesn't matter.

333
00:18:44,663 --> 00:18:46,697
We're a long way
from Thaddeus now.

334
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:49,450
I killed him, Abner.

335
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:52,820
I got our revenge.

336
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,856
I w-- I wish
you hadn't done that.

337
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:57,708
But why?

338
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,627
He tortured us --
you most of all.

339
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:02,946
I remember.

340
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:05,382
And I remember you were always
there to put me back together.

341
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:07,367
We were friends.
We <i>are</i> friends.

342
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:11,305
And the fall,
it's our second chance.

343
00:19:11,307 --> 00:19:13,590
We can forget our old hates,
who we were.

344
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:15,008
It's not that easy.

345
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,976
Yes, it is.

346
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:18,378
Look at me.

347
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,748
I'm happy.

348
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,219
And your vessel --
is he happy?

349
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:27,387
He was an abusive ass.

350
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:33,210
But I love my family,
and they love me.

351
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:38,799
I'm not a wise man,
Gadreel.

352
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:44,321
But I know this.
The key to happiness?

353
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:47,490
It's getting the one thing
you want most

354
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:49,726
and never letting it go.

355
00:19:53,264 --> 00:19:54,331
And what if there's a price?

356
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,634
There's always a price.

357
00:19:57,636 --> 00:19:59,853
But it's worth paying.

358
00:21:06,455 --> 00:21:08,839
You should not
have come here, Dean.

359
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:14,094
You kill my friend,
then you take my brother,

360
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:15,696
and you think I'm gonna
let that stand?

361
00:21:15,698 --> 00:21:17,431
I allowed you to live.

362
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,518
Mistake.

363
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:47,541
AbnerSo Crowley was here.

364
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:49,496
Yeah, um,
I thought you'd want to know.

365
00:21:49,872 --> 00:21:52,040
You thought right.

366
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:54,459
And now? Any idea
where he scampered off to?

367
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:55,693
Somerset, Pennsylvania,

368
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:59,580
with Dean Winchester
and the angel Castiel.

369
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:03,468
And you know this how?

370
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,287
They're chasing an Impala.

371
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:07,722
I helped them track it.

372
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:10,675
You <i>helped</i> Crowley?

373
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,610
Yeah.

374
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:16,431
I'm kind of playing both sides
until someone w--

375
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:19,834
until <i>you</i> win.

376
00:22:19,836 --> 00:22:21,102
Hm.

377
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:22,987
Smart, right?

378
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,700
No.

379
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:46,044
Sort of the opposite.

380
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:58,422
Welcome to the party, pal.

381
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:00,224
Cass, how we lookin'?

382
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:02,894
Most of Sam's internal
burns have healed.

383
00:23:02,896 --> 00:23:04,462
I should be able
to fix the rest.

384
00:23:04,464 --> 00:23:05,830
What's your name?

385
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:09,534
I thought I knew every angel in
heaven, but I've never seen you.

386
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:12,787
Why would I tell
you anything?

387
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:14,939
Well, I don't give a damn
who you are.

388
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:18,009
You need to get out --
now!

389
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:19,177
And if I don't?

390
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:23,714
Then you and I will have
a lovely little playdate.

391
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:27,435
Even bound,
I can rip this body apart.

392
00:23:27,437 --> 00:23:28,636
Tell them, Castiel.

393
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:30,238
You do, you die.

394
00:23:31,106 --> 00:23:33,007
You want this to end?

395
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:36,644
Go ahead.

396
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:39,297
Put a blade through
your brother's heart.

397
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:47,805
If it makes you feel better,

398
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:50,708
I have Sam locked away
in a dream.

399
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,843
As far as he knows,

400
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:54,378
the two of you are
working a case right now --

401
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,614
something with ghouls
and cheerleaders.

402
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:00,151
Why are you doing this,
huh?

403
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:03,788
We fought together.

404
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,640
And I trusted you.

405
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,876
I thought you were
one of the good guys!

406
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:13,998
I am doing
what I have to do.

407
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:18,719
Well, so am I.

408
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,851
So am I.

409
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,998
Hey.

410
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,752
I can't watch that
anymore.

411
00:25:24,754 --> 00:25:28,572
I understand.
It's not Sam, but...

412
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:29,406
It's still Sam.

413
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:31,425
Pretty much, yeah.

414
00:25:35,597 --> 00:25:37,181
How are you doing?

415
00:25:37,183 --> 00:25:39,967
You want to talk
about me now?

416
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:41,752
I want to talk about anything

417
00:25:41,754 --> 00:25:44,114
that's not a demon sticking
needles into my brother's brain.

418
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,512
Yeah, humor me, man.
How you doing?

419
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:55,600
Uh...

420
00:25:55,602 --> 00:25:59,704
I'm okay.

421
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:03,741
Good. Good.
That's, uh...

422
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,795
So, what, you just change the
batteries out, power back up?

423
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:09,113
It's that easy?

424
00:26:09,115 --> 00:26:13,834
It wasn't easy,
but I didn't have a choice.

425
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:16,620
Yeah.

426
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:19,123
Well, that's usually
how it goes.

427
00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:22,459
Cass...

428
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:24,378
I'm sorry.

429
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,713
About what?

430
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:27,098
Kickin' you
out of the bunker.

431
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,916
That's, uh...

432
00:26:28,918 --> 00:26:30,818
You know,
not telling you about Sam.

433
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,421
You thought his life
was at stake.

434
00:26:33,423 --> 00:26:35,606
Yeah, I got played.

435
00:26:35,608 --> 00:26:38,642
I thought
I was saving Heaven.

436
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:40,394
I got played, too.

437
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:43,114
So you're sayin' we're
both a couple of dumbasses?

438
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:46,617
I prefer
the word "trusting."

439
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:48,919
Less dumb. Less ass.

440
00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:52,490
Laverne! Shirley!

441
00:26:52,492 --> 00:26:53,991
Get in here!

442
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:02,216
Pinhead's out cold,
but watch this.

443
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,140
<i>Zir noco iad Gadreel.</i>

444
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:13,144
<i>Zir noco iad Gadreel.</i>

445
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:14,412
What's he saying?

446
00:27:14,414 --> 00:27:17,448
His name. Gadreel.

447
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,900
Does that mean
something to you?

448
00:27:19,902 --> 00:27:21,518
Well, it's why
I've never seen him.

449
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,454
He's been imprisoned
since the dawn of time.

450
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:28,459
Gadreel was the sentry who
allowed Lucifer into the garden.

451
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:30,711
My, my. A celebrity.

452
00:27:30,713 --> 00:27:33,381
Wait, the garden?
Like eden?

453
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:34,999
Adam and Eve?
Fig-leaves garden?

454
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:37,952
It's his fault --
all of it.

455
00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:42,807
The corruption of man,
demons, hell.

456
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,759
God left because of him.

457
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:46,877
The archangels --

458
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:48,896
the apocalypse.

459
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:52,650
If he hadn't been so weak,
none of it would have happened.

460
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:56,220
You ruined the universe,
you damn son of a bitch!

461
00:27:56,222 --> 00:27:57,488
Cass! Cass! Hey!

462
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,556
Dean, he --

463
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:01,826
I get it.

464
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:03,778
But you got to chill.

465
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:21,011
What's taking so long?

466
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:22,963
Other than the fact
that I'm trying to unravel

467
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:25,900
a living, multidimensional
knot of pure energy,

468
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:26,984
not much.

469
00:28:33,442 --> 00:28:36,694
It won't work.

470
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:40,481
You will never
find your brother.

471
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:45,486
Go ahead. Poke and prod.

472
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:47,405
I can sit in this chair
for years

473
00:28:47,407 --> 00:28:53,411
and watch you fail
over and over again.

474
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:55,796
I've endured
much worse than this, Dean.

475
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:58,699
So...much...worse.

476
00:28:58,701 --> 00:29:00,167
And I have all the time
in the world.

477
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:01,919
Shut up!

478
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,941
All right. Plan "B."

479
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:09,877
Cass,
you got to possess him.

480
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:11,429
What?
Do it now!

481
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:14,432
Get in there,
tell Sam what's going on,

482
00:29:14,434 --> 00:29:16,484
and help him kick
that lying son of a bitch out!

483
00:29:16,486 --> 00:29:17,618
It might work.

484
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,705
But I can't possess
a vessel without permission.

485
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,411
No. Not happening.

486
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:28,863
Don't be daft.

487
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:31,282
Demons can take
what they want.

488
00:29:31,284 --> 00:29:33,734
I can burrow
into that rat's nest of a head.

489
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:36,320
I can wake Sam up.

490
00:29:36,322 --> 00:29:38,489
Just call me plan "C."

491
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:40,107
You can't --
you got a better idea?

492
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:45,012
What about the angel?

493
00:29:45,014 --> 00:29:46,464
I'll work fast.

494
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:47,631
And if he finds you?

495
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:48,999
I'll run.

496
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,167
I'm not dying
for you lot.

497
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:51,869
Of course, if I do this,
you're gonna have to...

498
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:53,220
Take off the leash.
Yeah, I know.

499
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:54,705
And it stays off.

500
00:29:54,707 --> 00:29:58,859
I save Sam,
I leave here a free man.

501
00:29:58,861 --> 00:30:00,644
Do we have a deal?

502
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:07,034
Cass,
burn off Sam's tattoo.

503
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,805
Dean.
Do it.

504
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:13,874
Do it.

505
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,008
If you mess with Sam,
if you try anything --

506
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,077
I keep my bargains.

507
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,929
Besides, I don't want
to be inside your brother

508
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:37,481
any longer than I have to.

509
00:30:37,483 --> 00:30:40,100
I'm not one
for sloppy seconds.

510
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,485
When you find him,
say "Poughkeepsie."

511
00:31:00,121 --> 00:31:01,922
It's our go word. It means
"drop everything and run."

512
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:03,457
Fine.

513
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:07,962
While I'm gone,
hands off the suit.

514
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,764
I will destroy you.

515
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:15,686
Eat me.

516
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,322
AbnerA demon and an angel
walk into my brother.

517
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:44,042
Sounds like a bad joke.

518
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:47,361
Dean,
if this doesn't work...

519
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:54,135
It'll work.

520
00:31:58,874 --> 00:32:00,208
I mean, it just doesn't make
any sense.

521
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,877
Why is this ghoul only
chomping on dead cheerleaders?

522
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,978
Hey, you want a beer?!

523
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,313
No, I'm fine.

524
00:32:05,315 --> 00:32:06,848
Not bad.

525
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,017
Dean? Dean!

526
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:10,151
Poughkeepsie.

527
00:32:13,355 --> 00:32:14,656
How do you know that word?

528
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:17,575
Because Dean's sent me,
Bullwinkle, the real Dean.

529
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:20,862
I'll make this quick -- you've
been possessed by an angel.

530
00:32:20,864 --> 00:32:23,898
He's got you packed away in some
dusty corner of your own mind,

531
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,451
and I'm here to break you out.

532
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:28,670
Seriously?

533
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,588
Fine.

534
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,840
We'll do this the fun way.

535
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:36,845
See?

536
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:38,680
Not real. Like I said.

537
00:32:38,682 --> 00:32:41,415
I know how possession works,
Sam.

538
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,885
You've seen
everything that he's seen,

539
00:32:43,887 --> 00:32:45,270
even if you can't remember.

540
00:32:45,272 --> 00:32:46,554
That's what I need you to do.

541
00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:48,973
I need you to remember.

542
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:06,324
Did I kill Kevin?

543
00:33:06,326 --> 00:33:10,161
No, <i>you</i> didn't.
He did.

544
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,916
You need to take control,
Sam.

545
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:21,172
Blow it up and cast
that punk-ass holy roller out!

546
00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:26,344
What?

547
00:33:27,897 --> 00:33:30,014
Oh, bollocks.

548
00:33:30,983 --> 00:33:32,901
Hello, Sam.

549
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:34,402
Who are you?

550
00:33:34,404 --> 00:33:37,572
His name is Gadreel,
the original chump.

551
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:40,241
<i>Was</i> a chump.

552
00:33:40,243 --> 00:33:41,743
And now?

553
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:45,580
I'm going to be the one that
leads my kind back to heaven.

554
00:33:45,582 --> 00:33:47,081
I'm going to be a hero.

555
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:51,002
But you, demon,
for all your chatter,

556
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:53,171
you will always
be a coward.

557
00:33:55,007 --> 00:33:57,091
You should be running.

558
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:02,547
Aah!

559
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:21,015
Give up, boy.
You're not strong enough.

560
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,070
Take control, Sam!
Cast him out!

561
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:27,622
Get out of my --

562
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:32,026
you sure you want me
to go?

563
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,879
Maybe I'm the only thing
holding you together.

564
00:34:34,881 --> 00:34:36,914
I leave, you might die.

565
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:46,224
I said get...

566
00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:47,892
the hell...

567
00:34:47,894 --> 00:34:49,727
Out!

568
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:02,740
Waiting for someone?

569
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:06,194
I am, and he's late.

570
00:35:14,837 --> 00:35:17,088
Yes.

571
00:35:28,717 --> 00:35:31,185
Let me guess.

572
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:33,104
Winchester trouble?

573
00:35:39,528 --> 00:35:40,978
Sam! Cass?

574
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,933
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

575
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,737
Sam, are you okay?

576
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:50,771
Cass?

577
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:10,725
It's Abaddon.

578
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:15,012
Go. The back door.
I'll handle this.

579
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:16,597
Oh, 'cause you're
such a good guy?

580
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,683
Right now,
I'm the goodest guy you got.

581
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,905
This don't make us square.
I see you again --

582
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:25,907
I'm dead. Yes, I know.
I love you, too.

583
00:36:28,994 --> 00:36:32,363
Pleasure doing business
with you boys, as always.

584
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:48,996
Hello, darling.

585
00:37:01,015 --> 00:37:02,181
AbnerCrowley.

586
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:04,517
Bring me his head.

587
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:12,859
See, that's the thing
about demons.

588
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:14,727
They're only obedient
to a point.

589
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,431
Right.
Let's have a chat.

590
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:21,751
I'm not here to talk.
And I'm not talking to you.

591
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:25,204
I'm talking to them,
the average demon,

592
00:37:25,206 --> 00:37:27,206
because I feel their pain.

593
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:28,541
It must have been difficult,

594
00:37:28,543 --> 00:37:31,210
with your loving king
so cruelly taken from you.

595
00:37:31,212 --> 00:37:34,797
I imagine you felt
all at sea.

596
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:38,101
And then along came...
The brute.

597
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:43,623
She's strong...and a knight
and immortal --

598
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:44,924
at the moment.

599
00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:48,411
So I'm not surprised that
some of my more idiotic subjects

600
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:49,479
bought her line.

601
00:37:49,481 --> 00:37:52,515
But now?
Good news, fellas.

602
00:37:54,634 --> 00:37:55,918
Daddy's home.

603
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,937
Hell doesn't want you,
Crowley.

604
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:58,988
It's mine.

605
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,256
Is it?

606
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:03,660
Not what I hear.
Not while I'm still kicking.

607
00:38:03,662 --> 00:38:04,944
Well, then,
let's settle it.

608
00:38:04,946 --> 00:38:07,113
You and me. Right here.
Winner takes the crown.

609
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:09,415
See, that's your problem,
love.

610
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:11,734
You think this is a fight.

611
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:14,804
It's not?

612
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:16,122
It's a campaign.

613
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:18,624
Hearts and minds,
that's what's important.

614
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:20,610
See, the demons
have a choice --

615
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:24,664
take orders from
the world's angriest ginger --

616
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:25,848
and that's
saying something --

617
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,333
or join my team,

618
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:30,570
where everyone gets
a say, a virgin,

619
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:33,389
and all the entrails
they can eat.

620
00:38:34,841 --> 00:38:36,776
So, think on this, lads.

621
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:39,545
Spread the word --
vote Crowley.

622
00:38:58,732 --> 00:39:00,917
You feel better?

623
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,337
A little, yeah.

624
00:39:05,672 --> 00:39:07,724
It'll take time
to fully heal you.

625
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:10,643
We'll have to do it
in stages.

626
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,014
All right.
Let me hear it.

627
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,952
What you do want me to say --
that I'm pissed?

628
00:39:19,954 --> 00:39:21,971
Okay. I am.

629
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:24,407
I'm pissed.

630
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:26,659
You lied to me.

631
00:39:26,661 --> 00:39:27,693
Again.

632
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:28,745
I didn't have a choice.

633
00:39:28,747 --> 00:39:31,664
I was ready to die, Dean!

634
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:34,066
I know.

635
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:37,570
But I wouldn't let you,
because that's not in me.

636
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:38,871
So, what?

637
00:39:38,873 --> 00:39:42,708
You decide to trick me
into being possessed

638
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,245
by some...psycho angel?

639
00:39:46,247 --> 00:39:47,797
He saved your life.
So what?

640
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:49,816
I was willing to die.

641
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:57,056
And now...

642
00:39:58,425 --> 00:39:59,275
Kevin...

643
00:39:59,277 --> 00:40:01,027
No. That is not on you.

644
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,213
Kevin's blood
is on my hands,

645
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:07,784
and that ain't ever
getting clean.

646
00:40:07,786 --> 00:40:08,868
I'll burn for that.

647
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,604
I will.

648
00:40:11,606 --> 00:40:14,340
But I'll find Gadreel.

649
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:18,428
And I will end
that son of a bitch.

650
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,079
But I'll do it alone.

651
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,167
What's that
supposed to mean?

652
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:25,284
Come on, man.

653
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:27,437
Can't you see? I'm...

654
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:29,489
I'm poison, Sam.

655
00:40:29,491 --> 00:40:32,642
People get close to me,
they get killed...or worse.

656
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:35,228
You know,
I tell myself that I-I --

657
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,981
I help more people
than I hurt.

658
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:40,299
And I tell myself
that I'm --

659
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:41,851
I'm doing it all
for the right reasons,

660
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,653
and I -- I believe that.

661
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:48,774
But I can't -- I won't...

662
00:40:48,776 --> 00:40:52,028
Drag anybody through the muck
with me. Not anymore.

663
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:59,085
Go.

664
00:40:59,087 --> 00:41:01,504
I'm not gonna stop you.

665
00:41:08,662 --> 00:41:10,213
But don't go thinking

666
00:41:10,215 --> 00:41:11,764
that's the problem,
'cause it's not.

667
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:18,271
What's that
supposed to mean?

668
00:41:19,506 --> 00:41:21,390
Just go.
