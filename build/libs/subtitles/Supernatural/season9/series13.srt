1
00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:04,773
Something's broken here.

2
00:00:04,798 --> 00:00:05,961
I'm not saying
that it's not. I...

3
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:08,432
We don't...see things
the same way anymore --

4
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:11,051
Our roles
in this whole thing.

5
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,270
I can't trust you.
We are family.

6
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:15,672
You say that
like it's some sort of cure-all,

7
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:17,891
like it can change
the fact

8
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:21,061
that everything that has
ever gone wrong between us

9
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,163
has been
because we're family.

10
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:32,405
15, 14, 13, 12...

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,008
11, 10, 9...

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,994
8, 7...

13
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,912
6, 5...
No chipmunking allowed!

14
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,847
Swallow
or you're disqualified!

15
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:42,415
...2, 1...

16
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,194
Looks like we got a wiener!
Yeah!

17
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:57,481
He cheated!

18
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:00,400
Hey, back off, Skeletor.
I won fair and square.

19
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:01,702
Like hell you did,
Jabba!

20
00:01:01,704 --> 00:01:03,537
I saw you slip a hot dog
in your pocket!

21
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,289
Well, I hate to break it
to you, pal,

22
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,823
but that's no hot dog.

23
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:09,776
Ohh!

24
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:47,281
Mmm.

25
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:03,130
Mmm.

00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:41,418
Hey.

29
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,253
Hey.

30
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:49,593
You go to bed
last night?

31
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:52,729
What? Uh, no.

32
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:56,683
No, "Rudy" was on.

33
00:02:56,685 --> 00:02:59,152
"Unforgiven," and then I was
too jacked to sleep,

34
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:00,987
so...research.

35
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,906
Gadreel?

36
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:06,559
And Metatron
and the mark of Cain and...

37
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,578
Crickets.

38
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:12,449
I did find us a case, though.
Oh, yeah?

39
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:16,636
Yeah, was a strange death
in Stillwater, Minnesota.

40
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:19,589
A competitive eater died
after a hot dog-eating contest.

41
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,460
So, what? Death by tube steak?
If only.

42
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:26,530
He got attacked in
his car, but, uh, get this --

43
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:30,083
he shrunk from 300 pounds
to 90 pounds.

44
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,184
Witchcraft?

45
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,854
Or a heavy-duty laxative.
You game?

46
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:35,939
Yeah.
Good.

47
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:38,942
Looks like it's a whore's bath
for me. I'll be ready in five.

48
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,195
You sure
you're okay, Dean?

49
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:43,630
Why wouldn't I be?

50
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:46,076
'Cause --
I don't know you...

51
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:48,819
This isn't about what
I said the other day, is it?

52
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:52,439
Oh, about that we're
not supposed to be brothers?

53
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,458
No, don't flatter yourself.
I don't break that easy.

54
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,660
Oh, good, 'cause I was
just being honest.

55
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:59,246
Oh, yeah. No, I got
that loud and clear.

56
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:10,590
Thanks for
your patience, agents.

57
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:11,913
Coroner's report
finally came in.

58
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:13,478
All right,
thank you.

59
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,479
All right, let's see.

60
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:18,064
Did Wayne McNut
really weigh 300 pounds

61
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,900
just moments
before time of death?

62
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:21,852
316 to be exact.

63
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:24,637
And the official cause of death?
Cardiac arrest.

64
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,324
But between you and me,
that's just a guess.

65
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:29,743
The vic suffered
massive organ damage.

66
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:30,911
Here you go, Jenny.

67
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:34,698
Ruptured spleen,
pierced liver, collapsed lung.

68
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,366
Looked like everything
was just

69
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:37,701
Sucked
right out of him.

70
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:39,836
Like he'd been hoovered?
Yeah.

71
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:42,956
Yeah, you know, I got
to be honest, fellas -- hm?

72
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,258
We're stumped.

73
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,278
This type of thing just
doesn't happen in Stillwater.

74
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,764
Now, did Wayne
have any enemies?

75
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:52,132
Hmm.

76
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:55,302
More like
an unfriendly rivalry.

77
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:57,387
A guy named
"Slim Jim" Morgan.

78
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,139
Like Wayne,
he was pretty well-known

79
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,057
in the competitive-eatin'
circuit.

80
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:04,394
Competitive-eating circuit?
Is that a big thing out here?

81
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:06,897
Oh, yeah.
You betcha.

82
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,982
Folks take it
real seriously --

83
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:10,433
train for months.

84
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,453
Eat all sorts of wackadoo stuff,
you know, like, uh...

85
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:16,873
Baked beans,
buff wings, butter.

86
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,358
Butter?
Yeah.

87
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,277
Sometimes deep-fried.
Hm.

88
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,662
This year alone,
Wayne won the Butter Bowl,

89
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:26,333
the Wing Ding,
and Shrimptasia.

90
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:30,453
Anyhoo, point being, Wayne McNut
was the only one Slim Jim

91
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,906
couldn't beat in
the whole Great Lakes region.

92
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:35,241
So is he a suspect?

93
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:38,077
We checked him out, but Slim Jim
was in the Hot Doggery

94
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,746
at the time
of Wayne's death,

95
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:41,681
and we got 15 witnesses
to prove it.

96
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:43,466
Really?
Yeah.

97
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,812
Training.

98
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,732
When I gear up for
a competition, I eat lettuce --

99
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,033
stretches the stomach.

100
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:02,702
Yet another reason
to stay away from salads.

101
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,873
How well did you know
Wayne McNut?

102
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,910
Well, well enough to know
he was a weasel and a cheat.

103
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:13,547
I hate to say it,
but, uh, karma's a bitch.

104
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:14,831
This is interesting.

105
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,884
Mala's
good-luck charms.

106
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:19,219
And Mala is...?

107
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:21,221
My old lady.

108
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:23,773
Is your old lady
superstitious?

109
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,375
Yeah.
She's Romanichal.

110
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:28,061
Romanichal?
Gypsy.

111
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:30,513
But don't call her that.
She says it's reductive.

112
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,300
But I think
it's a compliment.

113
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:35,635
I mean, gypsies are
all the rage on TV --

114
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:38,939
"My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding,"
"Gypsy Sisters"...

115
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,774
"Keeping up
with the Kardashians."

116
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:46,663
Um
you mind if I use your bathroom?

117
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:48,147
Yeah, go ahead.

118
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:50,149
But use the one upstairs
at the back.

119
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:52,212
Mala's taking
a shower in ours.

120
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:53,075
Right.

121
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:57,674
Did you really lose
the "Wiener Winner" by one dog?

122
00:06:57,676 --> 00:06:59,175
Yeah.

123
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:48,172
And what are we talkin'?
Six inches? Foot-long?

124
00:07:48,197 --> 00:07:50,581
Look, agent. Am I a suspect
here or what?

125
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,120
'Cause unless you got
a warrant --

126
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,080
You, uh, ready to go?
Yeah.

127
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,765
Uh, Mr. Morgan,
thank you for your time.

128
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,300
If you remember
anything else,

129
00:07:57,302 --> 00:08:00,386
this is our number and
where we're staying locally.

130
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:16,119
All right, so, we got what
appears to be Wayne McNut's hair

131
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,238
and...
a bag full of weird.

132
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,726
In Romanichal culture, the pouch
is called a putsi bag.

133
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:24,594
It's used for hexes.

134
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:26,012
Okay, so, what?

135
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:28,548
Mala's putting hexes
on hubby's competition?

136
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:31,117
I mean, what do
we got ourselves?

137
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,152
A "thinner" sitch here?

138
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:34,521
Slim Jim
might not even know.

139
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:36,756
Hm.

140
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,153
Hi.

141
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,605
I believe you have
something of mine.

142
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:57,110
<i>Kill</i> Wayne?

143
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:59,112
I loved him!

144
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:01,447
So...you were...

145
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:04,617
Yes. Okay?
We were having an affair --

146
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:07,137
for years, actually.

147
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,390
I don't mean
to be rude, uh...

148
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:14,561
But how is it that Wayne McNut
is your type?

149
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,732
I mean, you're married to a man
who's barely a buck -- wet.

150
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:21,184
What can I say?

151
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,821
Sometimes it's nice
to feel a little <i>give.</i>

152
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:26,406
Oh.

153
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:30,410
Yeah, I get that -- a little
extra cushion for the, uh...

154
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:36,699
Help me
understand something.

155
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,170
If you loved Wayne,
why did you put a curse on him?

156
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:41,821
It wasn't a curse.

157
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:45,341
Putsi bags are also used
for blessings.

158
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:46,976
I wanted Wayne to win.

159
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:51,664
Plan was, take the prize money,
get a quickie divorce,

160
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,633
and then tie the knot
in Orlando.

161
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:58,138
Wayne used to call me
his "Princess Jasmine."

162
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:19,075
? Love lifts us up
where we belong ?

163
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,546
? where the eagles cry

164
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:28,468
? on a mountain high

165
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,506
? Love lifts us up
where we belong ?

166
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,843
? far from the world below

167
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,645
? up where...

168
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:57,080
I <i>gained</i> weight?

169
00:10:57,082 --> 00:11:00,250
How is that even possible?

170
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:06,589
Hello?

171
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,127
Anyone there?

172
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:20,603
Let's try this again.

173
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:12,417
Any idea what the vic
weighed beforehand?

174
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:14,269
165.

175
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:16,555
So...180.

176
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:18,307
Known fact -- all women lie
about their weight and age.

177
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:21,226
Wait, you told that waitress
the other day you were 29.

178
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:22,294
Mm-hmm.

179
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:24,563
Need anything else,
agents?

180
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:26,281
Yeah, is
Sheriff Hanscum around?

181
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:27,866
Sorry. She's out
for the rest of the week.

182
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:31,203
Hell of a time
to take a vacation, right?

183
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:34,990
Okay, so,
we have two victims,

184
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:37,826
with seemingly nothing
in common except, uh --

185
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:40,128
a love for eclairs.
Check this out.

186
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,785
What is that?
A birthmark?

187
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,252
Huh.

188
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:49,404
So the weight had to
come off somehow, right?

189
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:52,474
What if it's a suction mark?
A suction mark?

190
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:54,726
Okay.
Uh, changeling?

191
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:56,962
Yeah, but changelings
don't take over kids.

192
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:58,680
Neither of the vics
had any.

193
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:01,149
And we don't know if Wayne McNut
had a suction mark.

194
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,185
Unless we missed it.
Yeah.

195
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:05,687
Well, we should, uh, split up.
One of us should hit the morgue.

196
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:07,739
The other should stay here
and question the staff.

197
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:11,476
I'll stay.
Ain't gonna happen.

198
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:12,592
Why?

199
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:13,913
Because you're weird
around girls.

200
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,337
What does that mean, weird?

201
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,362
You're awkward. You know,
weird -- Sam Weird.

202
00:13:18,785 --> 00:13:21,703
Sorry, man.
I'm just being <i>honest.</i>

203
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,323
So, you were scheduled
to close the gym last night?

204
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:28,760
Yeah, but I didn't
exactly lock up.

205
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:30,996
Carol was still
working out,

206
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:33,632
and
I had a date.

207
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:36,435
I didn't want to
shortchange her, you know?

208
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:38,353
I mean, the poor girl
has been working so hard

209
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:39,855
to lose weight
for her wedding.

210
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:41,607
I slipped her the key,

211
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:44,726
and I told her to lock up
on her way out.

212
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:51,450
Oh, it's all my fault.

213
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:15,590
Hey.
Find anything at the morgue?

214
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:16,808
Yeah.

215
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,044
Uh, so, Wayne was
banged up pretty bad.

216
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:21,730
But on the back of his neck,
just below his hairline...

217
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:24,983
suction mark --
identical to Carol's.

218
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:26,985
Okay, so,
they both had marks,

219
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:29,220
just like the hot trainer
at Rollz.

220
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:30,889
But she was skinny...

221
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:32,357
and alive.

222
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,027
And just recently lost
a ton of weight.

223
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:36,995
When I asked her
about the mark, she, uh --

224
00:14:36,997 --> 00:14:38,997
she clammed up,
got all embarrassed.

225
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,199
So, uh,
I did some checking.

226
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:44,286
And it turns out that she took
a couple of "me" days

227
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:47,539
last month
and, uh, went here.

228
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:52,210
Canyon Valley?
Hm. Yeah.

229
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:02,304
When you look in the mirror,

230
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:04,556
do you recognize the fat person
staring back at you?

231
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:07,442
Have you tried every fad diet,
every fitness trend out there,

232
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:09,227
but nothing
seems to work?

233
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:11,763
Here at Canyon Valley,
we guarantee weight loss

234
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:13,431
with no surgery...

235
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:16,267
No extreme dieting...

236
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:22,741
...and no intensive
workout regimen.

237
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:25,944
Guaranteed results
in one week!

238
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:28,296
You <i>can</i> reach
your weight-loss goals.

239
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:30,549
We did.

240
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:32,334
But only if you reach
for the phone

241
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:33,919
and call
Canyon Valley...

242
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:35,253
Now.

243
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:37,723
How far away is that place?
Couple of hours.

244
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:47,065
We were really, really moved
by the online testimonials.

245
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:49,584
Oh, yeah.
That was some powerful stuff.

246
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,486
And you boys are both
certified personal trainers?

247
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:53,522
Yeah.
Yeah, personal training brothers.

248
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:56,742
Kind of like Hans and Franz,
but, uh, less German.

249
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:59,578
And you're certified in...

250
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,146
Makin' people sweat!

251
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:04,082
Yeah. Kickin' ass
and takin' names!

252
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:05,951
That's how we do!

253
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:11,456
Uh...

254
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,592
Uh, to clarify, uh, what my
brother's trying to say is,

255
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:15,627
w-w-we both have a passion
for-for fitness

256
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:17,095
and helping people.

257
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:18,296
Oh, us too.
Hm.

258
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:21,133
In fact,
that's how we first met.

259
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:23,769
I was Maritza's first client
back in Peru.

260
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:26,605
I was on a student visa --
homesick, stressed,

261
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:29,441
eating my troubles away.
Oh, he was the size of a casa.

262
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:30,859
Oh, it's true!

263
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:32,778
I was one empanada away
from a heart attack.

264
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,580
But then this...
gorgeous godsend

265
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:38,817
made me the lean, mean,
fighting machine I am today.

266
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:40,035
Hm.

267
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:41,870
Ho!

268
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,690
Oh.

269
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:49,411
But I digress.

270
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:52,330
Now, the good news is,
we are hiring.

271
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:56,334
The bad news is, there's only
one trainer position available.

272
00:16:58,354 --> 00:17:01,173
How do you feel about working
in another department?

273
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,558
Huh?

274
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,067
Nice shorts.

275
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,768
Nice hairnet.

276
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,720
Yeah, why do I got to be
the lunch lady?

277
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:17,939
Since when have you ever complained
about being around food?

278
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:20,892
- Okay, this is not food.
- Hey, new guy.

279
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:24,079
Quit flirtin' with the trainer
and keep scoopin', huh?

280
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:28,116
It's all right.
My, uh...Ashtanga yoga class

281
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:30,068
starts in five minutes.

282
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,337
How the hell do you know
anything about yoga?

283
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:34,906
You're not the only one
who's ever dated someone bendy.

284
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:40,011
Hey, you have
any oatmeal?

285
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:41,713
Yeah, I wish.

286
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:44,633
No, but we have, uh, something
that's tofu over there.

287
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:47,686
I -- what is that?
It's a pancake. It's tofu.

288
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:57,479
I feel like a baby
asking this, but...

289
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:59,931
Will the treatment hurt?
Not at all.

290
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:03,235
The only drawback of cupping is,
it leaves a suction mark.

291
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:04,536
It can bruise a little.

292
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:08,439
Cupping?

293
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:12,043
Yes, ancient Chinese secret.
All the celebrities do it.

294
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:15,046
It draws out toxins,
boosts metabolism.

295
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:16,865
You'll feel good.

296
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,467
Who knew?

297
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:23,605
Oh, excuse me.

298
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:26,808
It's just so relaxing
in here.

299
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,343
It's the aromatherapy.

300
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,228
The lavender
really packs a punch.

301
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,763
Huh.

302
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:36,551
Ahh. Geez.

303
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:39,254
That's wa-a-a-rm.

304
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:45,740
Flojo.

305
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:48,492
You got time to lean,
you got time to clean, huh?

306
00:19:48,494 --> 00:19:51,161
I'm starving.
What do we get to eat?

307
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:54,448
Same as the clients.
They expect us to eat this rabbit food?

308
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,834
It's not rabbit food.
It's super food.

309
00:19:57,785 --> 00:19:59,503
I'm not eating it.

310
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:05,626
At Canyon Valley, we're supposed
to lead by example.

311
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:09,029
This is
leading by example?

312
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:11,181
It's not for us, stupido.
It's for the clients.

313
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:13,600
They're allowed to have
pudding on their spa day.

314
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:17,271
It's like a -- a last hurrah
before the real work starts.

315
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:22,242
Get to work.

316
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:23,694
- Hey, Frank.
- Yeah?

317
00:20:23,696 --> 00:20:25,645
We need to order more asparagus.
Okay.

318
00:20:40,345 --> 00:20:42,262
Mm.

319
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:44,181
What do you know?

320
00:20:44,183 --> 00:20:46,633
Looks like
it's my "spa day," too.

321
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:56,693
Okay, good job, guys.
Go to, uh...

322
00:20:56,695 --> 00:20:58,695
Downward dog.

323
00:20:58,697 --> 00:21:01,031
Hold for five minutes.

324
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:03,283
Five minutes?

325
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:05,285
It's usually 30 seconds.

326
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:07,121
Right. Yeah, 30 seconds.

327
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:08,155
That's what --
that's what I mean.

328
00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:10,374
Okay, uh,
I'll just come around,

329
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:12,126
make sure everybody's
form is okay,

330
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:14,244
make sure you're, uh,
keeping your cores tight,

331
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:16,213
and, uh, your --

332
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:27,374
uh, good job. Great.

333
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:29,927
Straighten that back out.

334
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:38,519
Mmm.

335
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:45,025
Mm.

336
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:03,677
Well done today! Good job!

337
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,912
Good work, guys!
Good work!

338
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:07,581
Namaste!

339
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,267
Okay. Good work.
See you all soon.

340
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:12,052
Good job.

341
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:20,527
How was class?
It was, uh...great.

342
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:22,029
Yeah.

343
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:25,482
Agent Frehley?

344
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:27,985
What are you doing here?

345
00:22:27,987 --> 00:22:30,154
Agent Frehley?

346
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:32,990
Uh, I-I-I don't know. She must
be pretty out of it, huh?

347
00:22:32,992 --> 00:22:35,775
Oh, excuse me.

348
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:37,461
Sorry.

349
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:40,280
I got to get this.
Yeah?

350
00:22:40,282 --> 00:22:41,798
Have a good one.

351
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:44,501
Sammy.

352
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:45,636
Dean?

353
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:48,005
What's wrong with you?
I need your help.

354
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:50,591
Where are you?
Dean?!

355
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:55,429
Sweet potatoes.

356
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:57,898
Sw...

357
00:23:05,273 --> 00:23:07,140
Dean?

358
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:26,960
Dean!

359
00:23:34,602 --> 00:23:36,470
Dean?

360
00:23:39,357 --> 00:23:42,059
- Dean!
- Sammy.

361
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:45,612
Dean! Hey! Hey!

362
00:23:45,614 --> 00:23:47,030
Wake up!

363
00:23:47,032 --> 00:23:49,349
What took you so long?

364
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:51,952
What the hell happened?!
I was drugged.

365
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:54,154
Dru-- what?
Pudding.

366
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:56,290
It was supposed to be
for the clients,

367
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:57,658
but I couldn't resist.

368
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,576
What, salted caramel?

369
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:02,028
Yeah, man.
The best of both worlds --

370
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,630
salty and sweet.

371
00:24:03,632 --> 00:24:05,382
Right. Uh...

372
00:24:05,384 --> 00:24:06,917
All right, you stay here.

373
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:08,919
No, no,
I'm gonna come with you.

374
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:13,557
Go ahead, man.
I'll catch up.

375
00:24:23,768 --> 00:24:25,319
Hey.

376
00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:26,820
Did you make
the pudding?

377
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:28,722
Depends.
On what?

378
00:24:28,724 --> 00:24:30,691
Whether you
liked it or not.

379
00:24:31,743 --> 00:24:34,828
What's in it?
Relax, Jack Lalanne.

380
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,748
It's low-cal.
Nonfat milk, sea salt --

381
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,866
No, no.
Not the ingredients.

382
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:41,668
The something extra.

383
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:44,705
Chill, man.
Supplements, okay?

384
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,125
- What kind of supplements?
- Here. Hey.

385
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:51,461
To boost metabolism,

386
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:53,764
per Larry and Maritza.

387
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:58,552
These aren't "supplements",
they're roofies.

388
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:00,754
What? How do you know
what roofies look like?

389
00:25:00,756 --> 00:25:02,255
How do you <i>not</i> know?

390
00:25:02,257 --> 00:25:05,142
You think I want to end up
in a hotel bathtub

391
00:25:05,144 --> 00:25:07,144
with my kidney
carved out?

392
00:25:07,146 --> 00:25:08,928
In Chechnya?

393
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:13,450
Did you find
anything out in the yoga?

394
00:25:13,452 --> 00:25:16,019
Yeah. Yeah. "Invasion
of the Body Snatchers."

395
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:17,821
Every single person
in class

396
00:25:17,823 --> 00:25:20,540
had one of those
freaky-ass suction marks.

397
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:23,443
What the hell's
goin' on here?

398
00:25:23,445 --> 00:25:26,213
You know, I didn't mean
to bail on you fellas,

399
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:27,998
but I've been waiting
over six months

400
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,383
to get
into Canyon Valley.

401
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:31,401
And let me tell ya,
it was worth it.

402
00:25:32,754 --> 00:25:34,871
I already lost
10 pounds!

403
00:25:34,873 --> 00:25:36,790
In -- in one day?

404
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:39,459
No offense, Sheriff --
'cause you look great --

405
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:41,311
um, but aren't you
the least bit curious

406
00:25:41,313 --> 00:25:43,013
as to how you dropped
10 in a day?

407
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:44,314
Well, to tell you
the truth, Agent,

408
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:46,350
I don't really give
a flyin' fudge.

409
00:25:50,137 --> 00:25:53,440
My husband, Doug,
left me last year

410
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:57,811
'cause he said I loved
cookie-dough milkshakes

411
00:25:57,813 --> 00:25:59,396
more than him.

412
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:00,914
Sorry to hear that.

413
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:03,700
Yeah, Doug's a dick.

414
00:26:03,702 --> 00:26:05,218
You deserve better.

415
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,636
Thanks.

416
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:09,289
But he was right.

417
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:14,878
That was a dark time
for me.

418
00:26:16,681 --> 00:26:18,965
Whoever said
you eat your pain?

419
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:22,219
Not me. I guzzled it.

420
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:25,889
Anyhoo...

421
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:30,560
I guess I just wanted
to feel pretty again.

422
00:26:30,562 --> 00:26:33,096
And Canyon Valley
did that.

423
00:26:34,782 --> 00:26:36,817
Only question is...

424
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:38,735
What are you
doing here?

425
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:40,821
We're, uh, uh...

426
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:41,822
We're undercover.

427
00:26:41,824 --> 00:26:44,658
Yeah.
Sort of got that.

428
00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:48,495
We think that there's a
connection between Canyon Valley

429
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:50,063
and the murders in town.

430
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:53,083
What kind
of connection?

431
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:56,086
Suction marks.

432
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:58,305
You mean like this?

433
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:02,726
Yeah. Where did that come from?
My spa treatment.

434
00:27:02,728 --> 00:27:04,561
Cupping.
Cupping?

435
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:06,446
Yeah. You know,
I thought it was gonna hurt,

436
00:27:06,448 --> 00:27:09,065
but honestly, I snoozed
through the whole thing.

437
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:11,651
By the time I woke up,
I was down two dress sizes.

438
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:15,188
Before the cupping,
did you eat any pudding?

439
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,490
Darn tootin'.

440
00:27:16,492 --> 00:27:18,275
Licked the bowl clean.

441
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:20,994
Donna, do you remember
who did this treatment?

442
00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:22,279
Oh, yeah.

443
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:24,164
You betcha.

444
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,084
Evelyn,
you are looking great.

445
00:27:28,086 --> 00:27:30,086
Just 10 more pounds
till your goal weight.

446
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:32,706
Do you mind if I borrow
my wife for a sec?

447
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,240
I'll be back.

448
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:36,843
Looking good, ladies.

449
00:27:36,845 --> 00:27:38,512
Thank you.

450
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:40,764
The new guys aren't
personal trainers.

451
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:42,299
What are you talking about?
I did a little digging.

452
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:44,968
I found this
in their glove compartment.

453
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,721
They're Feds?
Worse.

454
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:48,922
They're hunters.

455
00:27:48,924 --> 00:27:51,107
Why are hunters here?

456
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:53,777
Maybe because of this.

457
00:27:55,863 --> 00:27:57,614
Oh, my God.

458
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:00,867
Do you think --
I do.

459
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:02,652
What are we going to do?
Relax. I'll take care of it.

460
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:04,321
Just get rid
of the evidence.

461
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,155
Okay, I'm no health nut,
but <i>that...</i>

462
00:28:56,157 --> 00:28:58,157
is just wrong.

463
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:03,380
All right, talk.

464
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:07,133
This isn't what you think.
I'm not a killer.

465
00:29:07,135 --> 00:29:09,269
Well, then,
what are you?

466
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:11,337
I'm a Pishtaco.

467
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:14,274
A fish taco?
A <i>Pishtaco.</i>

468
00:29:14,276 --> 00:29:17,561
It means
"Peruvian fat sucker".

469
00:29:18,696 --> 00:29:20,697
Never heard of it.
So, what, you're like vamps

470
00:29:20,699 --> 00:29:23,316
with a sweet tooth
for cellulite?

471
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:24,985
Vampires kill.

472
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:27,320
We're just...
Parasites.

473
00:29:27,322 --> 00:29:28,688
Oh, well,
in that case --

474
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,574
Look, I would
never hurt anybody!

475
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:34,911
Okay, this -- this is why Larry
and I started Canyon Valley.

476
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:36,880
We could help people
lose weight,

477
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:39,583
and I could feed.

478
00:29:39,585 --> 00:29:40,266
It was a win-win.

479
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:42,703
Yeah, except for
the two you dysoned to death.

480
00:29:42,704 --> 00:29:45,472
That wasn't me.
Well, then who was it?

481
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,044
Alonso.

482
00:29:51,762 --> 00:29:53,897
The dude
from the cafeteria?

483
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:57,817
He's my brother.

484
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:05,391
I knew you were
a lost cause.

485
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:06,893
Unlike your sister,
you're weak.

486
00:30:06,895 --> 00:30:09,395
Good to see you, too, Larry.
How could you do this to her?

487
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:11,581
To <i>us?</i>
Do what?

488
00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:15,752
This.

489
00:30:18,923 --> 00:30:21,124
Oh, that.

490
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:23,343
Oh
yeah, that.

491
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:25,295
You know what
<i>that</i> means?

492
00:30:25,297 --> 00:30:27,097
Huh?

493
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,598
Now there
are hunters here!

494
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,249
It's your fault,
blanco!

495
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:32,936
If you didn't starve me, maybe --
Listen, freak!

496
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:37,557
Your sister and I spent years
building this operation.

497
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:41,027
And if you think I'm gonna let
your gluttony destroy it,

498
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:42,896
you got
another thing coming.

499
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:44,397
I want you out.

500
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,866
Now.
I'm not leaving Maritza.

501
00:30:46,868 --> 00:30:48,818
Well, I got news
for you, pal.

502
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,437
She doesn't want you
here, either.

503
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,439
Either you leave...

504
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:55,458
or I'll make you.

505
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:28,875
I brought Alonso here from Peru

506
00:31:28,877 --> 00:31:31,795
to show him a better way,

507
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:35,215
a more civilized way.

508
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:38,468
One where
we weren't monsters.

509
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:44,891
That the secret to coexisting
with humans was just...

510
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:46,960
eating enough to get by.

511
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:48,428
Let me guess.

512
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,398
Alonso wasn't a big fan
of portion control, was he?

513
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,100
No.

514
00:31:54,769 --> 00:32:00,007
During a routine treatment,
he almost killed a client.

515
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:03,076
He sucked out
too much fat.

516
00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:06,313
I demoted him
to kitchen duty --

517
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:09,666
no human contact,
just fat from a jar.

518
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:14,604
But he said
the more I deprived him,

519
00:32:14,606 --> 00:32:16,623
the hungrier he got.

520
00:32:19,345 --> 00:32:22,980
And now three people
are dead.

521
00:32:23,715 --> 00:32:27,301
My husband...

522
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:31,504
Where's Alonso
right now?

523
00:32:32,857 --> 00:32:35,225
The -- the basement?

524
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:38,562
That's -- that's where he spends
most of his time now.

525
00:32:40,615 --> 00:32:43,183
What about her?

526
00:32:44,402 --> 00:32:47,487
Well, till we figure out
which side she's on,

527
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:50,357
she stays put.
I <i>am</i> on your side.

528
00:32:54,045 --> 00:32:56,163
Okay.
Then how do we kill him?

529
00:35:38,577 --> 00:35:41,912
You and stupido have no chance.
The fat makes us stronger.

530
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:44,915
Your sister didn't mention that
when she ratted you out.

531
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:46,383
You're lying!

532
00:35:55,593 --> 00:35:58,295
I guess after
you killed her husband...

533
00:36:00,414 --> 00:36:02,599
you were too monstrous,
even for her.

534
00:36:54,655 --> 00:36:57,823
We'll let you know if
we need any other information.

535
00:36:57,825 --> 00:37:01,026
Thanks for everything.
Appreciate it.

536
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:10,803
Hey.

537
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:14,440
What did you tell
the sheriff?

538
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:18,377
The usual --
psycho killer on the loose.

539
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:19,845
They, uh...

540
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:22,014
usually buy it.

541
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:26,152
I lost
my whole family today.

542
00:37:27,187 --> 00:37:29,355
I'm so sorry.
I...

543
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:33,192
Can I steal
you a sec?

544
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:41,751
Once this place
clears out,

545
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:43,619
we're gonna make this
a family affair.

546
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,237
Wait, Dean.

547
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,456
We're not gonna
kill Maritza.

548
00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:51,544
She's a monster.
Yeah, who saved our asses.

549
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:54,246
You said that you wanted to
keep things strictly business.

550
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:55,598
Well, last I checked,

551
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,184
we were in the <i>business</i>
of killing monsters.

552
00:37:58,186 --> 00:38:01,587
I wanted to keep things
strictly business between <i>us.</i>

553
00:38:03,307 --> 00:38:05,057
But I still have a heart.

554
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:06,943
What if I had crossed paths
with a hunter

555
00:38:06,945 --> 00:38:09,362
back when I was possessed
by Gadreel?

556
00:38:09,364 --> 00:38:10,730
I could've
ended up dead, too.

557
00:38:10,732 --> 00:38:13,032
Would I have deserved that?
Would I have deserved to die?

558
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,275
So, one-way ticket
to Peru?

559
00:38:52,272 --> 00:38:54,640
I'm hitting it.
Yeah.

560
00:38:54,642 --> 00:38:56,025
Hey.

561
00:38:57,027 --> 00:38:58,611
Yeah?

562
00:38:58,613 --> 00:39:01,364
About what you said
the other day.

563
00:39:01,366 --> 00:39:04,483
I thought it didn't
bother you.

564
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:08,054
You know, Sam, I saved
your hide back there.

565
00:39:09,122 --> 00:39:11,490
And I saved your hide
at that church...

566
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:14,627
And the hospital.

567
00:39:14,629 --> 00:39:17,580
I may not think things
all the way through.

568
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:19,965
Okay?
But what I do,

569
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:23,052
I do because
it's the right thing.

570
00:39:24,354 --> 00:39:26,555
I'd do it again.

571
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:30,693
And that...

572
00:39:30,695 --> 00:39:33,279
is the problem.

573
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:37,733
Y-you think you're my savior,
m-my brother, the hero.

574
00:39:37,735 --> 00:39:40,086
You swoop in,
and even when you mess up,

575
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:43,456
you think what you're doing
is worth it

576
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:45,124
because
you've convinced yourself

577
00:39:45,126 --> 00:39:48,377
you're doing
more good than bad...

578
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,697
But you're not.

579
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:55,301
I mean, Kevin's dead,
Crowley's in the wind, uh...

580
00:39:55,303 --> 00:39:57,536
We're no closer to beating
this angel thing.

581
00:39:57,538 --> 00:40:02,141
Please tell me, what is
the upside of me being alive?

582
00:40:02,926 --> 00:40:04,510
You kidding me?

583
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:09,598
You and me -- fighting
the good fight together.

584
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,689
Okay.

585
00:40:18,575 --> 00:40:21,777
Just once,
be honest with me.

586
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:26,232
You didn't save me
for me.

587
00:40:26,234 --> 00:40:28,567
You did it for <i>you.</i>

588
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:30,086
What are you
talkin' about?

589
00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:32,872
I was ready to die.
I was ready.

590
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:34,707
I <i>should</i> have died,

591
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:36,709
but <i>you...</i>

592
00:40:36,711 --> 00:40:38,427
You didn't
want to be alone,

593
00:40:38,429 --> 00:40:41,347
and that's what all this
boils down to.

594
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:43,081
You can't stand
the thought of being alone.

595
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,917
All right.
I'll give you this much.

596
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:47,553
You are certainly willing
to do the sacrificing

597
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:50,272
as long as you're not
the one being hurt.

598
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,728
All right,
you want to be honest?

599
00:40:56,763 --> 00:41:00,766
If the situation were reversed
and <i>I</i> was dying,

600
00:41:00,768 --> 00:41:03,369
you'd do the same thing.

601
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:09,258
No, Dean.

602
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:12,244
I wouldn't.

603
00:41:13,713 --> 00:41:16,232
Same circumstances...

604
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:18,617
I wouldn't.

605
00:41:28,261 --> 00:41:30,312
I'm gonna get to bed.

606
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:49,169
