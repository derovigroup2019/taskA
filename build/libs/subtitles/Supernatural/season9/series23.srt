1
00:00:02,479 --> 00:00:06,549
? Carry on, my wayward son ?

2
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:09,886
? there'll be peace
when you are done ?

3
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:14,290
? lay your weary head to rest ?

4
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:16,459
? don't you cry no more ?

5
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:17,894
I heard your prayer.

6
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:19,762
The angel lied to me.
He's not who he said he was.

7
00:00:19,764 --> 00:00:21,831
His name. Gadreel.

8
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,033
Gadreel is working
for Metatron?

9
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:26,369
Metatron made Gadreel
kill Kevin?

10
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,806
I was the one who caused
all the angels to fall.

11
00:00:29,808 --> 00:00:31,908
He took my Grace
for the spell.

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,909
That means you're human.

13
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:34,177
Long live the queen.

14
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:37,947
? Once I rose above
the noise and confusion ?

15
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,251
It's the bloody mark of Cain.

16
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:41,457
? just to get a glimpse
beyond this illusion ?

17
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:42,885
Without the mark,
the blade is useless.

18
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:44,587
? I was soaring ever higher ?

19
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:47,056
You're supposed
to lead the angels, Castiel.

20
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:48,991
? But I flew too high ?

21
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:50,660
I'm just trying
to get my people home.

22
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:53,529
? Though my eyes could see,
I still was a blind man ?

23
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:55,131
You are not the hero.

24
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,333
? Though my mind could think,
I still was a mad man ?

25
00:00:57,335 --> 00:00:58,069
I'm the hero.

26
00:00:58,094 --> 00:01:00,094
? I hear the voices
when I'm dreaming ?

27
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:04,374
You don't know
what it's like to be human!

28
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:06,876
? Carry on, my wayward son ?

29
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:08,177
I'm starting to think

30
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:09,345
the blade is doing
something to you.

31
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:11,414
? There'll be peace
when you are done ?

32
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,249
Have you told them about
your stolen Grace, Castiel?

33
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:14,870
? Lay your weary head to rest ?
Punish him.

34
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:15,531
I can't.

35
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:17,779
You just gave up
an entire army for one guy.

36
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,088
? Don't you cry no more ?

37
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,890
He's powering up
with the angel tablet.

38
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:22,358
Metatron's "secret portal""

39
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,427
from here on out,
I'm calling the shots. Capisce?

40
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:26,195
I'm not here to fight.

41
00:01:26,197 --> 00:01:27,597
At least give me a chance.

42
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,975
Drop the blade, Dean.

43
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:40,243
Move.

44
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:42,578
Dean. Look at me.
Sam! Move!

45
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:45,415
Aah!
Let it go!

46
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:47,483
Let it go!
Let it go.

47
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:53,623
The hell if you think I'm riding
the pine on this one, guys.

48
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,491
Something is wrong
with you, Dean.

49
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:59,128
And until we figure out what,
this is where you have to stay.

50
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,130
And you two
are gonna do what?

51
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:03,132
Take on Metatron
yourselves?

52
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:04,333
That's smart.

53
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:07,804
Oh, no, wait. No, you --
you lost your Angel army.

54
00:02:07,806 --> 00:02:10,907
And you -- now you're trying
to lock up the one guy

55
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:13,676
who has a shot at killing
the son of a bitch!

56
00:02:13,678 --> 00:02:16,612
Hell of a plan, fellas!

57
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:26,956
Look, hey, guys.

58
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,558
Sam.

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Sammy.

60
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:32,228
Sam.

61
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,397
Yeah?

62
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,566
Dean...wasn't wrong.

63
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:38,134
My followers
have abandoned us.

64
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:40,770
Yeah, and Gadreel says
he can help us.

65
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:44,540
From where I sit,
that's more than an even trade.

So, uh, Metatron.

69
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,993
Metatron.

70
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:40,429
God?

71
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:42,231
Just a second.

72
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,733
Is that
the new Angel handbook

73
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:45,668
you're working on,
or, uh...?

74
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,572
No, no,
this is a story, Neil,

75
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:51,874
a marvelous story,

76
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:55,378
full of love
and heartbreak

77
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,847
and...love.

78
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,148
Sort of like
"The Notebook."

79
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,716
Uh...

80
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:02,852
I love "The Notebook".

81
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:04,720
No.

82
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:08,224
Quick.

83
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:09,926
Which makes me look
more pathetic?

84
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:11,127
Why do you want to look
pathetic?

85
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,229
You've just reunited
all the angels

86
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:14,230
under the banner of heaven.

87
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:15,197
I mean, that's like...

88
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,399
Winning
a People's Choice Award?

89
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:19,569
Not quite the real deal,
now, is it?

90
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:20,970
All set?

91
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:22,438
Uh, yes, sir.

92
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,373
Uh, flip the switch...
Uh-huh.

93
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,908
...wait for the light,
and bingo.

94
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,378
And every angel in heaven
and on earth will hear me?

95
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,613
You and only you.

96
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:33,783
The signal blocks out
all other voices on angel radio.

97
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:37,153
Come on.

98
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,427
Hello?

99
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:47,563
<i>This is Metatron.</i>

100
00:04:49,032 --> 00:04:50,833
More reverb.

101
00:04:50,835 --> 00:04:52,335
Because I'm Lou Gehrig?

102
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:54,770
Sorry.

103
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,472
Sorry.

104
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:58,975
Don't do that.

105
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:06,682
I'd like to take a moment
to welcome you all back.

106
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:09,685
I want you to know
how moved I am

107
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:13,322
that you've accepted me
as your new God.

108
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:17,994
My heart, as they say, is full,

109
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:23,933
which is why I want to share
some wonderful news with you.

110
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:26,335
<i>I'm going on a short trip.</i>

111
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:29,071
<i>Heaven's door</i>
<i>will be temporarily closed</i>

112
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:30,239
<i>pending my return,</i>

113
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:34,076
<i>but rest assured</i>
<i>all will be explained.</i>

114
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:39,048
And it will be...Glorious.

115
00:05:47,257 --> 00:05:49,258
Where are you going?

116
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,628
To tell
the rest of the story.

117
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,642
Please.

118
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:08,210
I'll leave you alone,
I swear.

119
00:06:08,212 --> 00:06:10,346
We're not here to hurt you.

120
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:13,516
No. Your Grace.

121
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:16,786
Healing me
will only weaken you.

122
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:25,828
Did you hear him?

123
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,031
Metatron. Yes.

124
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,800
Where is he going?
What does he want?

125
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:35,571
I'm afraid...humanity.

126
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:42,411
Ohh...God!

127
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:44,947
I would have thought
you'd be more relaxed...

128
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:46,282
Having defeated Abaddon.

129
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:48,451
What can I say?

130
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:51,020
I wear my stress.

131
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:56,492
You know...

132
00:06:56,494 --> 00:07:00,496
With so many demons having
rallied back to your side,

133
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:04,967
well, it's only natural that
they would look to their...King

134
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:07,737
for some...direction.

135
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,007
Love, if I wanted a soapy
massage from Dr. Phil,

136
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:14,977
I would have hit 3
on the speed dial, all right?

137
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:18,481
I'm sorry, sir.

138
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:25,121
Sir, I believe
you're being summoned.

139
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,024
It's a Winchester.

140
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:39,535
What's that smell?

141
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:46,509
What the hell's happening to me,
you son of a bitch?

142
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:48,611
Liquor before beer,
bad taco?

143
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:49,845
How should I know?

144
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,148
I can't turn it off!

145
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,949
Ever since I killed Abaddon,

146
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:56,852
it's -- it's like
this whole...other thing.

147
00:07:56,854 --> 00:07:59,188
I get this high,
and I-I-I need to kill.

148
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,457
I mean, I really, really need
to kill.

149
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:02,525
And if I don't --

150
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:04,260
you yak your guts out.

151
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:08,798
It's the mark.

152
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,999
Meaning?

153
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:11,066
It wants you to kill.

154
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:13,169
The more you kill,
the better you feel.

155
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:15,771
The less you kill,
the less better you feel.

156
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,440
How much less better?

157
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:22,211
One would imagine
the least-best better.

158
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,114
So dead?

159
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,885
Well, Cain had the mark.
He didn't die.

160
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:31,253
Cain was a demon.

161
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:34,990
Your body's not strong enough
to contain the blade's power.

162
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:37,660
What if I got rid of it?

163
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:39,495
You want to get rid of it?

164
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,234
What I want is Metatron.

165
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:46,635
Go on.

166
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:48,637
But I have to get through
that door,

167
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,673
and I have to get
to the blade.

168
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,276
And you're gonna help me.

169
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:01,083
Oh, no.
What's that smell?

170
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:05,621
Sulfur.

171
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:16,682
Dean, pick up the phone.
Call me back.

172
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,392
I'm not kidding, all right?
Don't do this.

173
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:21,461
Not like this.

174
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:24,297
Are you sure
it was Crowley?

175
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:27,000
Who else would he summon?

176
00:09:27,002 --> 00:09:29,702
I mean, he and Crowley
have been bromancing

177
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:32,605
over the Blade ever since
Dean got the mark.

178
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:34,507
The mark?
The mark of Cain.

179
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:38,911
So that's what Dean
cut me with -- the First Blade.

180
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,782
In a way,
that could be useful.

181
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:43,816
What?

182
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:46,085
Well, Metatron is
more powerful than ever,

183
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,388
but if Dean has the First Blade
and the mark,

184
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,791
that might give us
our best chance.

185
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:53,226
You're joking, right?

186
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:56,062
An hour ago, we were ready to
throw Dean into a padded cell,

187
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:58,031
and now you say
he's our best chance?

188
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,465
Hear him out, Sam.

189
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,034
Oh, right. Excuse me.
Sorry, guys.

190
00:10:01,036 --> 00:10:02,735
Uh, sorry I'm a little less
than eager

191
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:04,303
to hear
that our best chance is --

192
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:07,540
is arming the warhead
and hoping it hits the mark.

193
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,375
This is not a bomb
we're talking about.

194
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:10,510
This is my brother.

195
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:12,211
And your brother would not be
in this alone.

196
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:13,346
We can help.

197
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:15,014
How?

198
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:16,783
I believe Metatron
has found a way

199
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:18,051
to tap into the Angel tablet,

200
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:20,586
harnessing its power to give him
powers equivalent to --

201
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:21,821
God, right?

202
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,890
I mean, that's what this is
all about, isn't it?

203
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:25,858
Metatron wants to be God.

204
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,430
Great, well, that basically
makes him unstoppable.

205
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:32,365
Not if we can break
the connection

206
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,033
between Metatron
and the tablet.

207
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:36,502
That would make him
just an ordinary Angel.

208
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,505
Where's the tablet?
Metatron's office.

209
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:41,340
In heaven?
I can get us to the door.

210
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:42,275
And then what?

211
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:44,043
I mean,
why would they let you in?

212
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:46,079
I-if Metatron's number two
shows up

213
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:48,381
with heaven's most wanted,
the gig is up.

214
00:10:48,383 --> 00:10:49,882
Sam, we have to try.

215
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:52,752
Damn it, Al, I don't care what
you've got going on tonight.

216
00:10:52,754 --> 00:10:53,720
He's your kid, too,

217
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:55,421
and I'm telling you
he's on drugs.

218
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:01,561
Oh, my God!

219
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,031
Oh, my God.

220
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,767
She's dead, man!

221
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:09,769
She's dead.

222
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:13,272
I'm not so sure
about that.

223
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,962
What can I get
you fellas?

224
00:11:35,964 --> 00:11:37,263
Coffee. Black.

225
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:38,664
Are you serious?

226
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,399
You take this girl's table,
her time,

227
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,401
you spread out like
an overgrown teenager,

228
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:43,569
and for what?

229
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:46,172
What's the tip on a single cup
of Joe? A nickel?

230
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:50,743
Double cheeseburger --
everything, heavy on the onions.

231
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:52,178
You got it.

232
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:58,284
So this is what you
and moose do, eh?

233
00:11:58,286 --> 00:12:01,921
Crisscross the country,
searching for evil,

234
00:12:01,923 --> 00:12:03,456
order your nitrates,

235
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,893
partake
of the local attraction.

236
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:07,894
Yep.

237
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:08,995
You never get tired
of the rat race?

238
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:11,464
Never get the urge
to just...bugger off

239
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,632
and howl at the moon?

240
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:16,435
Never ask yourself,
"is this it?

241
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:19,705
Is this all there is?"

242
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,778
I kicked human blood,
you know.

243
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,014
Oh, so you're
full-metal douche again.

244
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:31,117
Well, that's fantastic.
Would you like a stuffed bear?

245
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,452
Just trying to make
conversation.

246
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:36,155
How's hell, Crowley?

247
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:37,323
Hell's fine.

248
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:39,826
Hell's like
a Swiss watch.

249
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:42,094
Don't worry about hell.

250
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,397
Hell's complicated.

251
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,098
"Game of Thrones"
is complicated.

252
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,767
Shower sex --
that's complicated.

253
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:48,801
Hell ain't complicated.

254
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:51,537
Your problem ain't hell.
It's you.

255
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,973
Fair enough.
What's <i>your</i> problem, then?

256
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:55,875
My problem is Metatron.

257
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:57,977
Right now there's nothing.

258
00:12:57,979 --> 00:13:00,012
There's no angel smitings,

259
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:03,149
no crazy acts of God,
no vermin, hail.

260
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:04,984
If Metatron's making his move
on earth,

261
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:06,619
he is taking
his sweet-ass time.

262
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,858
Never fear.
Cavalry's here.

263
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,674
And?

264
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,810
Apparently...

265
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,678
Your angel
has gone viral.

266
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,315
<i>And that, America,</i>
<i>is perfection.</i>

267
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:39,619
<i>Yo, dude, that's your sister.</i>

268
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,825
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

269
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:47,460
<i>She's dead, man!</i>

270
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:48,728
<i>She's dead.</i>

271
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,163
<i>I'm not so sure</i>
<i>about that.</i>

272
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,070
<i>Is he ser--</i>
<i>is he freaking serious?!</i>

273
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:00,206
<i>Did you see that?!</i>
<i>Holy...</i>

274
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:04,477
<i>Tell me</i>
<i>you just got that.</i>

275
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,249
<i>Dude, what's your name?</i>

276
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:12,919
<i>Marv.</i>

277
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:14,787
When was this taken?

278
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:16,923
A couple of hours ago.
Muncie, Indiana.

279
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:18,057
What did he whisper
in her ear?

280
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:20,259
Exactly.

281
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,097
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

282
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,866
You're not gonna
eat your food?

283
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,872
Not hungry.

284
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:43,249
The door to heaven
is in a playground?

285
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:47,019
Guarded by two of Metatron's
most loyal.

286
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,088
I recruited them myself.

287
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,957
So, you said
you had a plan...

288
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,592
How we might convince them
to let us pass.

289
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,596
Wookiee.

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,336
Brother, I have no idea
what that means.

291
00:15:03,338 --> 00:15:05,604
It's a reference to a very
popular film that --

292
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,842
never mind.

293
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:22,154
Asariel.

294
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:25,458
Asariel, Purah, make way.

295
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,227
The door's closed, Gadreel,
by orders of Metatron.

296
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:30,596
And who do you think gave
the order to capture Castiel?

297
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:33,399
Unless you think Metatron
isn't interested

298
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:35,534
in questioning the leader
of the rebellion?

299
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,439
The spell must be redrawn.

300
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:43,042
As quickly as possible, then.

301
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:53,052
I got this.

302
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,226
I guess one of us
doesn't need a demon

303
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:02,495
to help follow
a clue trail.

304
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,832
You're looking
for miracle lady, right?

305
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:07,800
Yeah, she's gone.

306
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:09,402
I had a nice chat with her,
though.

307
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:11,437
Sam, whatever kind of
intervention you think this is,

308
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:13,005
trust me, it ain't.

309
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:14,607
I'm not gonna
explain myself to you.

310
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:15,609
Yeah, I sort of got that.

311
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,209
I just thought
you might like to know

312
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:19,278
that while you two have been
playing, uh, odd couple,

313
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,814
your real friends,
like Cass,

314
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:24,050
like the angel you stabbed --
Gadreel --

315
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:26,685
they're out there right now
risking their asses

316
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,087
to help you win this fight.

317
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:29,221
What the hell
are you talking about?

318
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:30,156
A fight, I might add,

319
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:31,924
you made
that much more complicated

320
00:16:31,926 --> 00:16:33,726
when you decided to stab
the one angel

321
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:35,594
who could actually get us
to Metatron.

322
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,630
You mean the angel that took you
for a joy ride?

323
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,565
The angel that slaughtered
Kevin? That angel?

324
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:42,568
Who you let in the front door
in the first place.

325
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,869
You tricked me, Dean.

326
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:46,639
And now I'm the one who wakes up
in the middle of the night

327
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,075
seeing my hands killing Kevin,
not you.

328
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:51,343
So, please, when you say

329
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:55,281
you don't want to explain
anything to me, don't.

330
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:57,116
I get it.

331
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:06,025
And I also get
that Metatron has to go.

332
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:11,163
And I know you're our best shot
to do that.

333
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:17,736
I'm gonna take my shot,
for better or worse.

334
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,141
I know.

335
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:23,576
No matter the consequences.

336
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:26,078
I know.

337
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:32,284
But if this is it,
we're gonna do it together.

338
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,821
You want to know what he
whispered to her, right,

339
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,056
in the video?

340
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,825
His next stop.

341
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,728
So what are we all
gollywagging on about?

342
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,196
Chop-chop.

343
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,366
Excuse me.

344
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:49,735
I'm not exactly
demon Minion number three here.

345
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,905
As the kids say,
I've got mad skills.

346
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:55,207
Look, I don't know
what you expected here, okay.

347
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,342
I don't really care,

348
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:59,078
but you wanted off
the hamster wheel.

349
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,379
Get off.

350
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:05,184
Well, I guess I've been
Winchestered.

351
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:09,788
I'd wish you boys good luck...
If I thought it would help.

352
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,521
Well done.

353
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,456
We've sent word
to Metatron.

354
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,758
He'll be back shortly.

355
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,992
You can wait inside.

356
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:50,029
Thank you, Ingrid.

357
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:03,075
What's going on?

358
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:06,278
No, no, no, no!
Not here!

359
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,547
Did you really think
your little ruse would work?

360
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:10,916
Please.

361
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:12,885
Please!

362
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:15,654
Welcome to heaven's jail,
Castiel.

363
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:19,091
I believe Gadreel
can give you the tour.

364
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,146
Excuse me?

365
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:46,752
I'm sorry,
but are you...Marv?

366
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:57,763
This is my friend George.

367
00:19:57,765 --> 00:19:59,932
I hear
you perform miracles.

368
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,901
It is a burden I accept.

369
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:04,603
A little single malt?

370
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,071
George.
What?

371
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,274
How about we take care
of that diabetes?

372
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,319
Left you a little something
to celebrate with.

373
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:22,921
Thank you.

374
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,091
He's a fraud!

375
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,195
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean, good sir.

376
00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:34,199
How can one be a fraud
when one offers nothing?

377
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:37,136
A little love,
a little hope,

378
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:39,972
the occasional miracle --
nothing more.

379
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:43,409
You know exactly
what I mean...Metatron.

380
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:45,344
Excuse me?

381
00:20:45,346 --> 00:20:46,645
His name is Metatron.

382
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,847
And much as he'd
like you to think...

383
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,750
He's not one of you.

384
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,218
He's an angel.

385
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,921
We both are.
An angel?

386
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,023
Okay.

387
00:20:58,025 --> 00:21:01,160
Somebody's been drinking
out of George's canteen.

388
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:03,195
So you deny you're
the former scribe of God...

389
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:04,596
Sir.

390
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,365
...a petty, unliked,
unloved angel...

391
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:07,933
These people
don't want to hear --

392
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,968
...driven by the relentless pursuit of
power and nothing more...

393
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,570
This has really gone
too far.

394
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:13,505
...who's already brought the rest
of the angels under his iron thumb.

395
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:15,774
As I will you, brother,
if you don't --

396
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,477
Shut your mouth!

397
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:20,779
Angel? Scribe of God?
Please.

398
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,381
It's true.

399
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:24,883
What is true is what I can see
with my own two eyes.

400
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:28,687
You want to call him
pathetic, common?

401
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:31,390
Be my guest.
Who here isn't?

402
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:35,461
But who here has the gift
that this man has?

403
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,730
Do you know what he did?

404
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:40,099
And I'm afraid
if you'd seen what I've seen,

405
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:43,268
you'd think of him as nothing
more than an abomination.

406
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,571
Abomination?!

407
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:47,139
Try "Miracle Worker"!

408
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:49,441
Try "Messiah."

409
00:21:49,443 --> 00:21:50,776
Better.

410
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:53,245
I am sorry
you don't believe me.

411
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:55,948
But I must do
what my mission demands.

412
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,183
I must protect you.

413
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,487
Yeah,
that's not gonna, uh...

414
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,026
They love me.

415
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:12,030
They really, really love me.

416
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:49,828
Anything?

417
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,730
Uh, yeah.
He's up there.

418
00:22:51,732 --> 00:22:53,331
About a mile up the road.

419
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,233
There's
a homeless encampment.

420
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:58,203
The way the folks are talking,
he's got them convinced

421
00:22:58,205 --> 00:23:00,772
he's some kind of new Jesus
or something.

422
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:03,808
You good?

423
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,144
Yeah, I'm good.

424
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,829
Listen, Sammy,
about, um,

425
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:26,498
you know,
the last couple of months...

426
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,600
I know.

427
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:34,339
So, before we find something
else to fight about...

428
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:37,809
...tell me...

429
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:40,679
Are you ready
to gut this bitch?

430
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,382
Ohh!

431
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:55,126
Sorry, little brother.

432
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:57,395
It's not your fight.

433
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:06,071
Okay, so you're telling me
that Metatron set you up,

434
00:24:06,073 --> 00:24:08,440
arranged
those suicide bombers

435
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:10,208
to make himself
look like the victim.

436
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,744
Gadreel was
his second in command.

437
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:14,879
For what other reason
than the truth

438
00:24:14,881 --> 00:24:16,614
would he turn against
Metatron?

439
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:19,150
So now I'm expected to trust
the word of an angel

440
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:21,786
who's only ever thought
of himself since the Garden,

441
00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:24,022
and you?

442
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:26,524
You told us
not a single angel more

443
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:27,992
would die in this fight.

444
00:24:27,994 --> 00:24:31,463
What do you think
I have been trying to do?

445
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:32,731
Trying?

446
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:34,065
By killing Metatron?

447
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:37,702
He is the reason
for all of our suffering.

448
00:24:37,704 --> 00:24:39,337
Nothing you say matters.

449
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:41,306
Would you rather
I not try at all?

450
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:42,774
Not if you can't prove it.

451
00:24:42,776 --> 00:24:44,509
So give us a chance.

452
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:47,145
Let us out, Hannah.

453
00:24:47,147 --> 00:24:49,447
Please.

454
00:24:56,922 --> 00:24:58,690
Can I help you?

455
00:24:58,692 --> 00:25:00,291
Take it easy, Chief.

456
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:02,260
You're Dean Winchester.

457
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:04,696
Now,
how did you know that?

458
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:06,297
He said you were coming.

459
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:12,771
Well, here I am.
Where's Metatron?

460
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:14,472
Marv.

461
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:16,708
Sure.

462
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,476
In there...

463
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:22,781
praying
for our forgiveness.

464
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:24,516
Forgiveness for what?

465
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:31,689
Is he, now?

466
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:50,908
I sat in this hole
for thousands of years,

467
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:55,246
thinking of nothing
but redemption,

468
00:25:55,248 --> 00:25:58,149
of reclaiming my good name.

469
00:25:58,151 --> 00:26:02,320
I thought of nobody, no cause,
other than my own.

470
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:04,556
You've been redeemed,
my friend.

471
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:07,859
The only thing that matters
in the end is the mission --

472
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:09,894
protecting those
who would not

473
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:12,030
and cannot
protect themselves --

474
00:26:12,032 --> 00:26:13,298
the humans.

475
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,634
None of us
is bigger than that.

476
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:20,872
And we will not let our fears,
our self-absorption

477
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:23,641
prevent us
from seeing it through.

478
00:26:23,643 --> 00:26:24,742
Not anymore.

479
00:26:24,744 --> 00:26:27,846
No. Of course not.

480
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,649
Move to the other side
of your cell, Castiel,

481
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:32,817
and keep your head down.

482
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:34,385
What are you doing?
When they say my name,

483
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:37,722
perhaps I won't just be the one
who let the serpent in.

484
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,520
Perhaps I will be known
as one of the many...

485
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:40,426
Gadreel.

486
00:26:40,427 --> 00:26:43,528
...who gave heaven
a second chance.

487
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,096
Run, sister.

488
00:26:45,098 --> 00:26:46,965
Gadreel.

489
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:12,690
Do you believe him now?

490
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:16,160
You can save
the humble-pie Jesus routine

491
00:27:16,162 --> 00:27:18,897
for somebody
who gives a damn.

492
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:25,503
The problem with you, Dean,
is the cynicism.

493
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:28,940
Always with the cynicism.

494
00:27:28,942 --> 00:27:30,808
But most people --

495
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:35,747
even the real belly crawlers
living in filth...

496
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:37,482
Or Brentwood...

497
00:27:37,484 --> 00:27:40,952
They don't want
to be cynical.

498
00:27:40,954 --> 00:27:44,255
They just want something
to believe in.

499
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:45,523
And that'd be you.

500
00:27:45,525 --> 00:27:47,659
Why not me?

501
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:51,129
You've been working those people
outside for, what, a day?

502
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:54,399
They've already spilled blood
in your name.

503
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:57,235
You are nothing
but Bernie Madoff with wings.

504
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:01,439
So I'm a fake.

505
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:08,179
Do you have any idea
how much pan-cake makeup

506
00:28:08,181 --> 00:28:10,381
and soft lighting it took

507
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:13,651
to get God
to work a rope line?

508
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,956
He hated it.

509
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:21,759
And, you know,
humans sense that.

510
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:25,430
So they prayed
harder and longer

511
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:29,901
and fought more wars
in his name.

512
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:31,769
And for what?!

513
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:34,606
So they could die
of malaria?

514
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:35,640
Leukemia?

515
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:38,209
And all the while,
blaming themselves!

516
00:28:38,211 --> 00:28:41,379
"Oh, if only I'd been
more prayerful,

517
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:43,381
"God would have loved me!

518
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:45,416
God would have saved me!"

519
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:46,684
You know what?!

520
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:49,520
God didn't even know
their name!

521
00:28:49,522 --> 00:28:50,922
But I do.

522
00:28:50,924 --> 00:28:55,226
Because I've walked
among them.

523
00:28:55,228 --> 00:28:57,929
And I can save them.

524
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:59,964
Sure, you can.

525
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:02,367
So long as your mug
is in every Bible

526
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:05,570
and "What would Metatron do?"
is on every bumper.

527
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:07,639
And?

528
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:11,175
What, are you blaming me
for giving them what they want,

529
00:29:11,177 --> 00:29:12,910
giving them a brand
they can believe in?

530
00:29:12,912 --> 00:29:15,213
I'm blaming you for Kevin!

531
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:18,850
I'm blaming you
for taking Cass' Grace.

532
00:29:18,852 --> 00:29:19,884
Hell, I'm blaming you

533
00:29:19,886 --> 00:29:21,519
for the cubs not winning
the world series

534
00:29:21,521 --> 00:29:23,721
in the last
100 freaking years.

535
00:29:28,661 --> 00:29:31,195
Whatever it is...

536
00:29:31,197 --> 00:29:33,564
I'm blaming you.

537
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:35,833
The First Blade.

538
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:40,371
Nasty piece of work,
isn't she?

539
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:44,909
Okay,
let's say you win, Dean,

540
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:47,178
and I die.

541
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,981
What's the world
left with then, hmm?

542
00:29:49,983 --> 00:29:54,552
A herd of panty-waisted angels
and you?

543
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:56,954
Half out of your mind

544
00:29:56,956 --> 00:30:00,124
with lord knows what
pumping through those veins?

545
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:03,094
Yeah, you see,
the only thing you've said

546
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:05,963
that went into my ear
was that you die.

547
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:09,400
Ohh.
Fine. We'll fight.

548
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,505
I don't know what you expect
is gonna come of all this.

549
00:30:14,507 --> 00:30:17,542
Unless...

550
00:30:17,544 --> 00:30:20,211
That's why
you're stalling.

551
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:25,016
Because you know
nothing's gonna come of this

552
00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:28,820
unless your pals succeed
upstairs.

553
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:31,422
Well,
here's a news flash --

554
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,691
humpty and dumpty
are starring

555
00:30:33,693 --> 00:30:35,259
in their very own version

556
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:38,262
of "locked up abroad: Heaven"
right now.

557
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,211
Wow, that big blade

558
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:56,714
and that...
douchy tribal tat

559
00:30:56,716 --> 00:31:00,051
sure gave you
some super juice.

560
00:31:00,053 --> 00:31:01,853
Whoo!

561
00:31:01,855 --> 00:31:04,088
Okay.

562
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,126
Aah!

563
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,164
Where is it?

564
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,100
Remove her.

565
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:33,505
Aah!

566
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,220
So, you took
Abaddon's scalp,

567
00:31:36,222 --> 00:31:39,490
then you figured you'd take on
little old nebbishy me.

568
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:40,892
What could go wrong?

569
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:44,095
And you're powered by the bone
of a jackass,

570
00:31:44,097 --> 00:31:46,964
and it is just awesome,
right?

571
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:49,634
Here's a tip --

572
00:31:49,636 --> 00:31:54,405
next time, try to be powered
by the word of God.

573
00:32:09,955 --> 00:32:11,489
Stay back.

574
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:13,891
Stay back!

575
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:15,259
Where's Metatron?!

576
00:33:08,046 --> 00:33:10,948
No-o-o!

577
00:33:40,177 --> 00:33:42,478
Hey. Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey. Hey.

578
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,490
Well played, Castiel.

579
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:58,027
Obviously,
you and Gadreel

580
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:00,196
managed to turn a few
dead enders against me.

581
00:34:00,198 --> 00:34:01,230
Gadreel is dead.

582
00:34:01,232 --> 00:34:03,632
Ah.

583
00:34:03,634 --> 00:34:07,102
So Gadreel
bites the dust.

584
00:34:07,104 --> 00:34:09,738
And the Angel tablet --

585
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,674
arguably the most powerful
instrument

586
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:13,409
in the history
of the universe --

587
00:34:13,411 --> 00:34:16,145
is in pieces,
and for what again?

588
00:34:16,147 --> 00:34:20,416
Oh, that's right --
to save Dean Winchester.

589
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:23,319
That was your goal,
right?

590
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:26,455
I mean, you draped yourself
in the flag of heaven,

591
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:31,093
but ultimately, it was all about
saving one human, right?

592
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:34,079
Well, guess what.

593
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:36,975
He's dead, too.

594
00:34:38,756 --> 00:34:41,171
And your sitting in my chair.

595
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:48,410
Sammy, you got to get out
of here before he comes back.

596
00:34:48,412 --> 00:34:49,645
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.
Shut up. Shut up.

597
00:34:49,647 --> 00:34:50,846
Just save your energy,
all right?

598
00:34:50,848 --> 00:34:52,181
Oh, man.
We'll stop the bleeding.

599
00:34:52,183 --> 00:34:53,916
We'll -- we'll get you a doctor
or -- or I'll find a spell.

600
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,050
You're gonna be okay.

601
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,519
Listen to me.

602
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:58,721
It's better this way.

603
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:00,189
What?

604
00:35:00,191 --> 00:35:02,525
The Mark.

605
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:04,927
It's making me into something
I don't want to be.

606
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:06,161
Don't worry about the Mark.

607
00:35:06,163 --> 00:35:08,030
We'll figure out the Mark later.
Just hold on, okay?

608
00:35:08,032 --> 00:35:09,031
Get you some help.

609
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:10,399
Aah!

610
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,234
You will never
get away with this.

611
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,969
Get away with what?

612
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:15,070
You told a silly story

613
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,906
to a group
of less-than-believers.

614
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,774
I'll clean up your mess
in an hour.

615
00:35:18,776 --> 00:35:21,076
You give our brothers
and sisters

616
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,478
far too little credit.

617
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,047
They will soon learn that you
have been playing them.

618
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:29,084
And then?

619
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,487
They will do nothing

620
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:34,456
because they are
frightened little sheep

621
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:37,126
following my crook
wherever it leads.

622
00:35:37,128 --> 00:35:39,328
And where I'm taking them,

623
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,831
back to our rightful place
atop this mountain

624
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:45,367
of human shame
and excrement --

625
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:47,036
when that happens,
trust me,

626
00:35:47,038 --> 00:35:49,305
they're not gonna care
how they got there.

627
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:51,907
What happened with you
being okay with this?

628
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:53,242
I lied.

629
00:35:53,244 --> 00:35:54,610
Ain't that a bitch?

630
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:56,779
You know,
while you could never

631
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,547
quite pull it together,
Castiel,

632
00:35:58,549 --> 00:36:01,750
while you're sitting here
with Your Grace

633
00:36:01,752 --> 00:36:03,619
slowly burning away

634
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:07,356
and your reputation
long extinguished?

635
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:08,791
No curiosity.

636
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:10,893
You didn't read enough.

637
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:16,565
You never learned
how to tell a good story.

638
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:20,569
But you did.

639
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,851
Sam. Hold up.
Hold up.

640
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:45,394
I got to say something
to you.

641
00:36:45,396 --> 00:36:48,297
What?

642
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:52,701
I'm proud of us.

643
00:36:57,974 --> 00:37:00,609
No, no. Hey, hey, hey.

644
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:02,578
Hey, wake up, buddy.

645
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,013
Hey.

646
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:06,315
Dean.

647
00:37:06,317 --> 00:37:07,716
Dean!

648
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:33,937
You're doing
the right thing --

649
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:35,238
letting him live.

650
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,641
It's what a leader
would do.

651
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:40,944
I'm no leader, Hannah.

652
00:37:40,946 --> 00:37:43,046
I never was.

653
00:37:43,048 --> 00:37:46,916
I just want to be an angel.

654
00:37:46,918 --> 00:37:50,153
And Your Grace?

655
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:52,989
What will you do
about that?

656
00:37:52,991 --> 00:37:55,759
You will die
if you don't replenish it.

657
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,908
? Come down off your throne ?

658
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,312
? and leave your body alone ?

659
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:20,650
? somebody must change ?

660
00:38:20,652 --> 00:38:26,523
? you are the reason
I've been waiting so long ?

661
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:30,727
? somebody holds the key ?

662
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:34,164
? but I'm near the end ?

663
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:40,136
? And I just ain't got
the time ?

664
00:38:40,138 --> 00:38:44,507
? and I'm wasted,
and I can't find my way home ?

665
00:38:44,509 --> 00:38:48,178
Damn it, Crowley.

666
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,381
You got him into this mess.

667
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:54,718
You will get him out...

668
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,287
or so help me, God.

669
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:03,626
? Mm, mm, mm, mm ?

670
00:39:03,628 --> 00:39:09,466
? but I can't find my way home ?

671
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:12,469
? mm, mm, mm ?

672
00:39:12,471 --> 00:39:14,704
? mm, mm, mm ?

673
00:39:14,706 --> 00:39:19,776
? but I can't find my way home ?

674
00:39:19,778 --> 00:39:23,513
Your brother,
bless his soul,

675
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:27,117
is summoning me
as I speak.

676
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,986
Make a deal,
bring you back.

677
00:39:29,988 --> 00:39:32,922
It's exactly what I was
talking about, isn't it?

678
00:39:32,924 --> 00:39:38,461
It's all become so...
expected.

679
00:39:40,998 --> 00:39:43,666
You have to believe me.

680
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:46,636
When I suggested
you take on the Mark of Cain,

681
00:39:46,638 --> 00:39:50,440
I didn't know
this was going to happen.

682
00:39:50,442 --> 00:39:52,475
Not really.

683
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:58,882
I mean, I might not have
told you the entire truth.

684
00:39:58,884 --> 00:40:01,985
But I never lied.

685
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:05,088
I never lied, Dean.

686
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,957
That's important.

687
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:10,794
It's fundamental.

688
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:16,433
But...there is one story
about Cain

689
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:21,971
that I might have...
forgotten to tell you.

690
00:40:21,973 --> 00:40:26,342
Apparently, he, too,
was willing to accept death,

691
00:40:26,344 --> 00:40:32,449
rather than becoming the killer
the Mark wanted him to be.

692
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:36,886
So he took his own life
with the Blade.

693
00:40:36,888 --> 00:40:38,021
He died.

694
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:43,026
Except,
as rumor has it,

695
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:46,196
the Mark
never quite let go.

696
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,037
You can understand
why I never spoke of this.

697
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:58,708
Why set hearts aflutter
at mere speculation?

698
00:41:01,145 --> 00:41:05,215
It wasn't
until you summoned me...

699
00:41:05,217 --> 00:41:07,050
No, it wasn't truly

700
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:11,221
until you left
that cheeseburger uneaten...

701
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:22,131
...that I began
to let myself believe.

702
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:25,435
Maybe miracles do come true.

703
00:41:25,437 --> 00:41:28,705
Listen to me,
Dean Winchester,

704
00:41:28,707 --> 00:41:31,574
what you're feeling right now --
it's not death.

705
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:35,578
It's life --
a new kind of life.

706
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,548
Open your eyes, Dean.

707
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,650
See what I see.

708
00:41:40,652 --> 00:41:42,852
Feel what I feel.

709
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:47,524
And let's go take a howl
at that moon.
