1
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:05,475
Sammy's hurt.
He's hurt real bad.

2
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:08,211
This one goes out to any angel
with their ears on.

3
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:13,083
This is Dean Winchester...
And I need your help.

4
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:14,384
Start with a name.
Ezekiel.

5
00:00:14,386 --> 00:00:15,885
There is a chance I can fix
your brother.

6
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:18,855
How will it work?
I heal Sam while healing myself.

7
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:20,590
Sam can eject me
at any time.

8
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,212
And if Sam does eject me,
he will die.

9
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:25,606
Then we keep it a secret
for now.

10
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:27,357
I just got to hope that you're
one of the good guys.

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,641
I am.

12
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:32,479
Zeke!

13
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:34,498
You can bring her back
like you did with Cass.

14
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:39,035
I cannot keep doing that.
Why the hell not?!

15
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:42,339
Every time I use my power,
it weakens me.

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,325
Merry Christmas.

17
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:47,127
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off --

18
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,112
saving people,
hunting things...

19
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:50,163
The family business.

20
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:52,015
<i>Becky, it's all real.</i>
I <i>knew</i> it!

21
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:53,800
Nipples?

22
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:57,170
I mean, come on.
We hunt monsters!

23
00:00:57,172 --> 00:00:59,506
Why am I here?!

24
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:00,474
I mean, normal people,

25
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:01,725
they see a monster,
and they run.

26
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:03,009
But not us -- no, no, no.

27
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:05,145
We search out things
that want to kill us.

28
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,347
Real. It's real.
No, no, no.

29
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:08,865
Now you die.

30
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,618
You know who does that?
Crazy people!

31
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,619
I'm Batman.

32
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:15,555
We...are insane!

33
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:17,190
I lost my shoe.

34
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:21,711
That was scary.

35
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:27,334
<i>And with a 1:20 left</i>
<i>in the game, it's 62-54.</i>

36
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:30,253
<i>This team wants</i>
<i>that championship.</i>

37
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:31,588
<i>It would be great.</i>

38
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,872
<i>He's up.</i>

39
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:34,224
<i>It's good, but the ref's</i>
<i>on the whistle.</i>

40
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:37,744
<i>He's calling a foul.</i>
<i>It could be charging.</i>

41
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:40,013
<i>Number 10 --</i>
<i>he's not happy about that.</i>

42
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:42,382
<i>This guy just about</i>
<i>could foul out,</i>

43
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:44,684
<i>and nobody but the ref</i>
<i>wants to see that happen.</i>

44
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,686
<i>Coach Johnson</i>
<i>watching the clock.</i>

45
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:49,439
<i>He calls time-out.</i>

46
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,107
<i>Talking to the ref right now.</i>

47
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,275
<i>You know, so far in this game,</i>

48
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:54,060
<i>there have been</i>
<i>a number of fouls called</i>

49
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:55,996
<i>by this particular ref,</i>
<i>and that's not...</i>

50
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:02,836
Easy, Colonel.

51
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:27,611
Is anyone here?

52
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:39,906
Whoa!

53
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:48,164
Gets me every time.

54
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,806
What's the matter, boy?
It's me.

55
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:07,234
What the hell?

56
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:30,029

58
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,915
Wow.

59
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,415
What?

60
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:40,583
Kevin.

61
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:43,486
Just poured some buffalo milk
down his gob twice.

62
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,787
Buffalo milk?

63
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,172
Yeah,
the hangover cure-all.

64
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:48,925
It's got everything in it.
Except buffalo milk.

65
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:51,644
How is that kid still recovering
from Branson?

66
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:53,463
What can I say?
He's an amateur.

67
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:56,483
The slippery nipple shots at
the Dolly Parton Dixie Stampede

68
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:57,717
nearly killed the guy.

69
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,818
All right.

70
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,353
Well, uh,
I got something

71
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:02,071
that's gonna get us
back on the road.

72
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:04,240
A case?
Yeah.

73
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:05,442
You sure
you're ready for that?

74
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:09,061
Why would I not be ready
for that?

75
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:11,748
Aren't you kind of running
on empty?

76
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,533
Yeah, but the last
three nights straight,

77
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:14,918
I had eight hours
of shut-eye.

78
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,419
And for a hunter,
that's like 20.

79
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,171
Trust me, Dean.
I feel good.

80
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,706
Well, that's great and all,
James Brown,

81
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,291
but you're still recovering
from the trials.

82
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:23,293
I think you ought to pace
yourself, you know?

83
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:25,545
And the sooner
you heal...

84
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:28,581
Yeah?

85
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,800
I just want you
back to your old self.

86
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:31,851
I am, Dean.

87
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,219
Look, Kevin's back
on the heaven spell.

88
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:34,270
Crowley's locked up.

89
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:35,922
We should be out there
doing what we do best.

90
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:38,191
Well...
You want to listen at least?

91
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:39,108
Okay, great.

92
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,144
Taxidermist
named Max Alexander

93
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:42,445
mysteriously crushed
to death.

94
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:44,647
Nearly every joint in his body
dislocated,

95
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:45,615
every bone broken.

96
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:47,367
Poor guy is
a human pretzel.

97
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:49,736
You tell me what's got
that kind of strength.

98
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:51,103
A demonic Luchador?

99
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:53,907
Shop's a couple hours away
in Enid, Oklahoma.

100
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,491
We should at least
check it out.

101
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:58,294
Unless there's some reason
you think we shouldn't.

102
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:08,471
Subtle.

103
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:11,140
Check that out.

104
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:13,176
Huh.

105
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:24,187
Well, the creep factor
just skyrocketed.

106
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,738
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

107
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,641
How are you?
Agents Michaels and Deville.

108
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:31,578
The body's already been
to the morgue.

109
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,997
Just wrapping it up
with Dave Stephens.

110
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,782
He's the one
who discovered the body.

111
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:39,452
Such a shame.
I used to go hunting with Max.

112
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:40,753
He was a real good egg.

113
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,171
Sorry for your loss.
Thanks.

114
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:43,673
You mind showing my partner
around?

115
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:45,375
I just got a couple questions
for Mr. Stephens.

116
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:47,377
Okay. Come on.

117
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:51,497
Dave Stephens?
Yeah.

118
00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:53,132
I just got a couple questions
for you

119
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:54,217
if that's all right.

120
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:56,002
I'll tell you
whatever you need to know.

121
00:05:56,004 --> 00:06:00,023
Max was a...a real pal.

122
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:01,691
Hunting buddy?

123
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:03,943
Mm. Yeah.

124
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:06,062
Eh, lucky guess.

125
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:09,115
So, uh, about what time
did you discover the body?

126
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:12,785
About 9:00 a.m. --
my usual pickup time.

127
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:15,405
I come in every Wednesday
and Sundays,

128
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,356
uh, to collect
the entrails.

129
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:19,158
The what?

130
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,327
The animal organs.

131
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:22,545
Ah.

132
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:26,332
After Max would, uh,
dig them out and work his magic.

133
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:27,834
Huh.

134
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:30,887
He, uh -- he was
a real artist, you know?

135
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,391
Strange thing is, though, uh,
bins were empty this morning.

136
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:37,427
Why is that strange?

137
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,178
Well,
because it's a Sunday.

138
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,464
Weekend hunts
are pretty much a given

139
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,683
in this neck of the woods,

140
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:45,318
so they're usually, mm,
chock-full of guts.

141
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,437
Ah.
Mm.

142
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,322
Any chance Max could have
cleaned them out himself?

143
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:51,223
No. It's a --
it's a biohazard.

144
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:53,860
You can't just, you know,
throw the stuff out.

145
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,361
You got to burn it.

146
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,830
Huh.

147
00:06:57,832 --> 00:06:59,749
Is there, uh, anything else
missing from the shop?

148
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:03,119
No. The register was full,
and the safe was intact.

149
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:06,089
And all of Max's trophies
were still on the walls.

150
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:08,925
And was there anybody else here
when you showed up?

151
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:11,127
No one.

152
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:16,132
No, other than, uh...
The Colonel.

153
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,918
Hmm.

154
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,854
Excuse us.

155
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:24,273
So?
Okay, so, uh...

156
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:27,026
We got a thief
who's jonesing for animal parts,

157
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:29,562
we got a pagan symbol,
and we got a human pretzel.

158
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:31,280
Yeah, it all sounds
very witch-y,

159
00:07:31,282 --> 00:07:32,932
but I wasn't
able to find a hex bag.

160
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:35,218
All right,
well, let's keep digging.

161
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,370
But, uh, not here.

162
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:40,707
I don't like the way
that one's looking at me.

163
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:53,119
Okay, uh, that...symbol
in the graffiti,

164
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:54,587
it's...not wiccan.

165
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:57,056
It's copywritten.

166
00:07:57,058 --> 00:08:01,811
Local animal-rights group,
Enid's answer to PETA.

167
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:04,347
S.N.A.R.T.?

168
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,882
You got to be kidding me.

169
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:08,134
Well, it makes sense
that an animal-rights group

170
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:09,952
would have an axe to grind
with a taxidermist.

171
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:13,156
Why?
The animal's already dead.

172
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:15,108
Yeah, but hunters
are what keep them in business.

173
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,077
Now the question is,
are those bleeding hearts

174
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,480
actually witches
or just hippies?

175
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,084
What's the difference?

176
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:31,490
Always knew I'd find
the source of all evil

177
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:33,159
at a vegan bakery.

178
00:08:33,161 --> 00:08:36,328
What's that smell?

179
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,597
Patchouli.

180
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,500
Yeah, mixed with depression
from meat deprivation.

181
00:08:41,502 --> 00:08:42,802
Hey.

182
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:45,271
You know who wears sunglasses
inside?

183
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:46,722
Blind people.

184
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:48,775
And douchebags.

185
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:57,366
Olivia
and Dylan Camrose?

186
00:08:57,368 --> 00:08:59,118
At your service.

187
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,820
You two are members
of s.N.A.R.T.?

188
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:03,689
Founders and co-presidents,
actually.

189
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:06,626
Uh, can we interest you
in some literature?

190
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:08,861
Or a flaxseed scone?

191
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,880
It's wheat-free,
gluten-free, sugar-free,

192
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:12,131
and surprisingly moist.

193
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,549
Let me stop you
right there.

194
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:18,588
Uh, we're here to investigate
the death of Max Alexander,

195
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,006
a local taxidermist.

196
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:21,891
He's...dead?

197
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:22,892
You knew him?

198
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:26,512
Ish. Um...small town.

199
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:28,481
Well, he was murdered
last night,

200
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,233
and a S.N.A.R.T. logo was found
at the crime scene.

201
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:31,767
You two wouldn't happen
to know

202
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,519
anything about that,
would you?

203
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:38,891
His business is funded
by hunters,

204
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:41,527
and you know
how hunters are.

205
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:42,578
They're selfish dicks

206
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,747
who define themselves
by what they kill.

207
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:48,534
And as animal advocates,
we couldn't stand for that.

208
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:50,903
So, you killed him?

209
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:52,571
Of course not.

210
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:54,957
S.N.A.R.T. doesn't tolerate
violence.

211
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,342
Huh.

212
00:09:56,344 --> 00:09:59,378
This coming from a couple
who spray-paints death threats.

213
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,747
It was a scare tactic.
We just wanted to spook him.

214
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:04,083
Turns out we were the ones
who got spooked.

215
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:05,551
What does that mean?

216
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:11,924
Well, last night,
when we were tagging the joint,

217
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:13,776
we heard this noise.
A hissing noise.

218
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:15,611
It freaked us out,
so we ran out into the alley.

219
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:18,614
But someone attacked us.
Sprayed us in the eyes with mace.

220
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:19,649
And it's not like we could go
to the cops.

221
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:21,567
So, now we look
like total douchebags

222
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,936
because we have to wear
our sunglasses inside.

223
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,284
Necrosis?

224
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:40,636
Premature death
of tissues --

225
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:41,954
that's why their eyes
were all messed up.

226
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:44,257
And it's not caused
by mace.

227
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,925
All right.
What caused it?

228
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:49,729
Right here. "Blunt force,
radiation, venom."

229
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:50,947
As in "snake"?

230
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,648
The taxidermist
was constricted.

231
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,267
Olivia and Dylan
heard hissing,

232
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,985
and they were sprayed
in the eyes.

233
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:57,970
By venom.
By venom.

234
00:10:57,972 --> 00:11:00,273
Okay, so...
What are we talking here,

235
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:02,641
some sort of a freaky-ass
snake monster?

236
00:11:02,643 --> 00:11:04,911
Maybe.

237
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:10,482
The weird thing is snakes
either envenomate or constrict.

238
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:11,951
No snake does both.

239
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:15,154
Correction --
freaky-ass mega-snake monster.

240
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:18,374
It could be a Vetala.

241
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:20,076
Yeah, but they're not afraid
to sink their fangs in.

242
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,161
Taxidermist was
bite-free.

243
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:24,096
It doesn't really fit
the profile.

244
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:25,631
Right. So...?

245
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:29,669
So, call Kevin.
Have him look some stuff up.

246
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:44,700
Aren't you early,
dude?

247
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:54,360
Hmm.

248
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:06,232
Dude!

249
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:09,168
You said you were from
a perfume company.

250
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,581
No! No, please!

251
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:39,555
Claw marks.

252
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:42,442
Yeah. The cops said
all the cats went missing.

253
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:43,693
Right, so, yesterday,

254
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:45,144
uh, we're dealing with
some sort of a snake monster.

255
00:13:45,146 --> 00:13:46,279
Today,
it's a killer kitty.

256
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,780
I don't know.

257
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:49,098
Hey.

258
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,734
Why does that mutt
look familiar?

259
00:13:56,924 --> 00:14:01,160
That was
the taxidermist's dog.

260
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:03,663
So, he's been
at both crime scenes?

261
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:05,715
Yeah.

262
00:14:05,717 --> 00:14:07,950
Maybe he's a suspect.

263
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:11,337
You know may--

264
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,423
Could be a skinwalker,
maybe a shapeshifter.

265
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:17,343
Doesn't really look
like a monster to me.

266
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:19,679
One way to find out.

267
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:22,432
Come here, boy.
Hey.

268
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:24,300
This isn't gonna hurt
at all.

269
00:14:24,302 --> 00:14:27,653
Unless it hurts.

270
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:35,478
Hmm.

271
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,481
I guess we can, uh,
rule out killer.

272
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:43,986
Do you agents need
any further assistance?

273
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:47,256
Officer, I think we're okay.
Thanks.

274
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:49,342
All right,
well, let me know.

275
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:56,382
Officer. Excuse me.
Uh, can I borrow your hat?

276
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:08,010
Good luck
getting adopted.

277
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,551
Okay, so,
the Colonel's not a suspect.

278
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:17,703
Yeah,
but he's a witness.

279
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:20,706
Hey, boy.
You speak sign language?

280
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,325
That's monkeys.

281
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:23,876
Huh?

282
00:15:23,878 --> 00:15:26,045
You know what?
This is gonna sound crazy.

283
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:27,363
I read this book once
about this guy

284
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:29,365
who tried to teach his dog
to speak

285
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:30,750
after it witnessed
a murder.

286
00:15:30,752 --> 00:15:32,502
It worked?

287
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:33,869
No.

288
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:35,555
But he wrote a book
about it?

289
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:37,006
Yeah, well, he doesn't have
what we have.

290
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:39,342
Kevin. Hey, it's me.

291
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,177
How do we speak
to a dog?

292
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:44,213
An Inuit spell.

293
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:45,565
Yeah.

294
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:49,936
Who knew the, uh, Men of Letters
had its own Eskimo section?

295
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:52,738
And it's supposed to let us
communicate with the Colonel?

296
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,393
Yeah,
well...that's the plan.

297
00:15:57,395 --> 00:16:02,415
Kevin said it's like a sort of
a human/animal mind meld.

298
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,066
Meaning?
If it works,

299
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:07,670
we should be able to read
the Colonel's thoughts.

300
00:16:10,174 --> 00:16:11,574
All right, I'll do it.

301
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:13,075
You -- you got enough
on your plate.

302
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:14,594
Like what?

303
00:16:16,214 --> 00:16:19,799
Uh, like...you're tired.

304
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:21,584
You're on the mend.
Okay?

305
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:24,303
Plus, you -- you've got
a sensitive stomach.

306
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:26,806
Last thing we need is
you chucking this stuff up. Huh?

307
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,311
Doesn't look so bad.

308
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:40,653
I was wrong.

309
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:42,321
Come on.

310
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:49,495
Ha!

311
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:53,216
<i>"Deila h?r me.</i>

312
00:16:53,218 --> 00:16:58,855
<i>Dag eru nou rar</i>
<i>vitur orum."</i>

313
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,242
All right.
Let's get this party started.

314
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:05,127
Tell me
everything you know.

315
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:10,516
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

316
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,654
Tough crowd.

317
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:25,031
? <i>I got to take a little time</i> ?

318
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,283
So, call Kevin.

319
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:31,120
? <i>A little time to think things over</i> ?
spell tasted like ass and was a bust.

320
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:33,322
At least it didn't affect
your appetite. Geez.

321
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:34,790
Yeah.

322
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,092
Change the station.

323
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:38,878
? <i>I better read</i>
<i>between the lines</i> ?

324
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,847
Change the station.

325
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,299
? <i>In case I need it</i>
<i>when I'm older</i> ?

326
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:45,301
What?
What?

327
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:47,053
You -- shut up.
It's working!

328
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:48,738
It -- go!

329
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,856
? <i>Ohh</i> ?

330
00:17:50,858 --> 00:17:52,258
Say that again.

331
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,143
You call
this classic rock?

332
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:57,363
Next thing you know,
they'll be playing Styx.

333
00:17:57,365 --> 00:17:59,865
? <i>Now this mountain I must climb</i> ?
And Dennis DeYoung? A punk.

334
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,567
Dennis DeYoung's
not a punk.

335
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:03,035
He's Mr. Roboto,
bitch.

336
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:05,488
Why are you arguing with the dog
about Styx?

337
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,074
Wh-- uh, yeah.
Um, hey, boy.

338
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:10,242
What were you trying to tell us
about the cowboy hat?

339
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:13,212
The douchewheel
who killed my best friend

340
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:15,214
was wearing a cowboy hat.

341
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:16,415
And the pothead, too?

342
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,534
Yep.
Same guy killed both.

343
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:21,003
? <i>In my life</i> ?
Ask about the cats.

344
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:23,339
Yeah, uh --

345
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:24,674
? <i>There's been heartache</i>
<i>and pain</i> ?

346
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:26,592
And what about the cats?
? <i>I don't know</i> ?

347
00:18:26,594 --> 00:18:28,043
I don't know.
I don't want this.

348
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:29,495
I couldn't see much.

349
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:32,982
I didn't exactly have
the best view in the orphanage.

350
00:18:32,984 --> 00:18:34,817
Oh,
but I could smell him.

351
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:38,387
Guy reeked of red meat,
dishwashing detergent

352
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:40,556
and tiger balm.

353
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:41,657
Huh.

354
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:43,075
So, what's he saying?

355
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:47,229
Uh, that the -- the guy,
he smelled like ground chuck

356
00:18:47,231 --> 00:18:49,565
and soap suds
and old-lady cream.

357
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:51,534
Dean,
what are you doing?

358
00:18:51,536 --> 00:18:54,170
? <i>I want you to show me</i> ?
I don't know.

359
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,423
Oh, what are you
laughing at?

360
00:18:57,425 --> 00:18:59,759
Uh...

361
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:06,932
Hey!

362
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:08,917
Hey, hey! Yeah!

363
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,253
You! You!

364
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:12,938
Hey! Hey!

365
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,524
Hey, hey, you! You!

366
00:19:15,526 --> 00:19:18,611
You! You!

367
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:21,764
Uh, Dean?

368
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,115
Hmm?

369
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:25,067
I think the spell worked.

370
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:27,036
Fact, I think it worked
a little too well.

371
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:27,987
What?

372
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:30,623
I think...
you might be a dog.

373
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,874
What?

374
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:33,159
You're scratching
your head.

375
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:34,627
You're...barking
at the mailman.

376
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:35,611
You're playing fetch.

377
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:37,780
I --

378
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:46,005
Ruh-roh.

379
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:54,156
Yeah.
No, that -- okay.

380
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:56,324
All right. Thanks.

381
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:59,360
So, apparently, the Inuit spell
has some side effects.

382
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:00,745
Oh, well, that would have been
nice to know

383
00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:01,863
<i>before</i> I downed it!

384
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:03,415
What kind
of side effects?

385
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:06,201
When you mind meld
with an animal,

386
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:09,954
it's...possible to start
exhibiting some of its behavior.

387
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:14,676
Don't look at me, Hoss.
It ain't my fault.

388
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:18,430
Well, how long am I gonna have
the urge to...

389
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:19,997
Sniff butts?

390
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,716
Oh, whoa.
Hey.

391
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:23,868
I don't have the urge
to sniff butts.

392
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,236
Yet.

393
00:20:25,238 --> 00:20:27,338
Do you really h-have
the --

394
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,808
No! Come on!

395
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:34,195
Well, Kevin doesn't know
how long it'll last.

396
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:36,514
It's not like
it's an exact science, you know?

397
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:39,067
But hopefully,
when the spell wears off,

398
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:42,203
so will the side effects.

399
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,924
I wouldn't eat that
if I were you.

400
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:48,910
Chocolate?

401
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:50,795
Seriously.

402
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,171
Where we headed?

403
00:21:00,173 --> 00:21:01,589
Back to the shelter.

404
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:04,509
To sniff out more clues,

405
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:06,177
maybe dig up
something we missed?

406
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,062
All right, one more doggy pun
out of you,

407
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:09,547
and I'm gonna
have your nuts clipped.

408
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:11,399
I hate to break it to you,
Hoss.

409
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:14,352
My sack's emptier
than Santa's after Christmas.

410
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,774
Aw, are you kidding me?

411
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:21,559
Hey, dick move,
pigeon!

412
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:22,827
Screw you, asshat.

413
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:25,113
Did --

414
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:26,581
what?

415
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,183
Wait a minute.
Can I hear all animals?

416
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:29,467
Yep.

417
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:33,538
Animals have a universal
language -- like esperanto.

418
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,424
But this one
actually caught on.

419
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:38,259
And I'm just
getting started, too.

420
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:39,794
Brewing a real big one.
Ha.

421
00:21:39,796 --> 00:21:42,046
Bet your ride's gonna look
sweet in white.

422
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:43,155
What's he saying?

423
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:45,224
You --
he's being a douchebag!

424
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:46,942
Who you calling "douchebag,"
douchebag?

425
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:48,994
Oh, shut it,
you winged rat!

426
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:50,112
Dude.
What?

427
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:51,530
Hey.
Just calm down.

428
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:53,699
Just get in the car.

429
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,501
Ha ha. That's right, Sally.
Go cry to mama.

430
00:21:55,503 --> 00:21:57,286
Oh, that's it,
you son of a bitch!

431
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:59,905
Ooh! Dean! Hey!
Get in the car.

432
00:22:18,274 --> 00:22:19,308
I think
it's probably best

433
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,442
to just leave the Colonel
in the car.

434
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:21,426
Excuse me?

435
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:23,095
Well all the windows
are open.

436
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:25,147
You think we like that?

437
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:26,899
"We"?

438
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:29,601
You think
because the windows are open

439
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:31,236
that that's some sort
of a treat, huh?

440
00:22:31,238 --> 00:22:33,322
No,
the dog's coming in.

441
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:36,875
Respect.

442
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:54,343
? uh-huh

443
00:22:56,296 --> 00:22:58,397
Yeah, baby.

444
00:22:58,399 --> 00:22:59,848
? Ohh

445
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,466
You said it.

446
00:23:01,468 --> 00:23:03,268
? Ooh

447
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,571
Dean.
Yeah.

448
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:08,907
So, what else
can you tell me

449
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:10,142
about the man
with the cowboy hat?

450
00:23:10,144 --> 00:23:13,779
Honestly, I couldn't see much.
Damn cataracts.

451
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:16,115
And you know no one's going to
pay for my surgery.

452
00:23:16,117 --> 00:23:19,668
Just another casualty
of the system, I guess.

453
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,571
I don't belong here, you know.
I'm pedigreed.

454
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:24,923
Well, I'm sure
you'll be out of here soon.

455
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:27,426
Please. I'm 14.

456
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:31,597
Good luck...Ma'am.

457
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,668
Once a day
they clean these cages.

458
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,853
Once a day!

459
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:39,504
Okay.

460
00:23:39,506 --> 00:23:41,006
A biscuit.
Just one biscuit.

461
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:44,810
I need a Raquel Welch poster
and a rock hammer.

462
00:23:44,812 --> 00:23:47,012
I'm shaking the fence, boss.
Still shaking the fence.

463
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:51,116
- Over here!
- I was framed!

464
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:53,852
Any luck?
Hardly.

465
00:23:53,854 --> 00:23:56,354
And I'm not getting any clues --
just a bunch of complaints.

466
00:23:56,356 --> 00:23:58,490
Hey, pretty boy.
Over here.

467
00:23:58,492 --> 00:24:01,126
Yeah, uh, sorry, pal.
I'm done for the day.

468
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:03,078
But I saw everything!

469
00:24:04,998 --> 00:24:09,201
And I'll tell you,
but...

470
00:24:09,203 --> 00:24:10,085
It'll cost you.

471
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:11,703
What?
Are you kidding me?

472
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:13,422
I'm being extorted by a dog.

473
00:24:13,424 --> 00:24:15,340
Well, what do you want,
huh?

474
00:24:15,342 --> 00:24:18,060
What? Beggin' strips?
Snausages?

475
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:19,211
Bitch, please.

476
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:21,580
If I'm gonna
rat someone out,

477
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:23,065
it's got to be
worth my while.

478
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:26,051
I want...a belly rub.

479
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:28,403
You --

480
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:30,055
All right.

481
00:24:30,057 --> 00:24:31,206
Not from you, sweetie.

482
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,358
From that big one.

483
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,029
Over there.
Hi!

484
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:40,449
Ohh, a-a cowboy hat,
leather pants.

485
00:24:40,451 --> 00:24:42,701
The dude's
a total closet case.

486
00:24:42,703 --> 00:24:44,736
Okay, what else can you tell me
about the guy

487
00:24:44,738 --> 00:24:46,004
other than his outfit?

488
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:49,541
Um, he was carrying
a burlap sack for the cats.

489
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:51,009
What does he want
with the cats?

490
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:53,011
Ooh, attaboy, yes.
Hell if I know.

491
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:56,298
But he took all of them,
except for the one he ate.

492
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,517
Ew.
What?

493
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,521
Apparently, our guy has
a sweet tooth for kitty cats.

494
00:25:02,523 --> 00:25:03,939
Huh.

495
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:07,192
Oh. Oh, and the sack had
something written on it.

496
00:25:07,194 --> 00:25:09,194
Okay, what did it say?

497
00:25:11,482 --> 00:25:13,232
Hey, come on.
We had a deal.

498
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:15,267
Well, you tell that
to the tall drink.

499
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:17,435
He's the one
who stopped rubbing.

500
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:18,570
Sam.

501
00:25:18,572 --> 00:25:19,604
Hand cramps.

502
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:22,607
He's not talking.

503
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:25,827
Attaboy.

504
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:29,181
It said
"Avant-Garde Cuisine."

505
00:25:29,183 --> 00:25:32,050
Lucky for you,
I read French.

506
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:34,253
That's a caf?
on Main Street.

507
00:25:34,255 --> 00:25:35,587
"No dogs allowed."

508
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:38,757
Well, no wonder he smelled
like hamburgers and dish soap.

509
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,008
We got to go downtown.

510
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,127
Apparently our guy works
at a restaurant.

511
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:44,296
Whoa-oh, yeah.

512
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:47,516
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Sure you don't want to adopt me?

513
00:25:47,518 --> 00:25:48,850
No, thanks.
Uh, we'll pass.

514
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:50,969
No,
I'm not above licking feet.

515
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:52,821
Hey, big'un!
Come back here!

516
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:54,106
All right.
Well...

517
00:25:54,108 --> 00:25:55,574
Hey, hold up.

518
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:57,309
What's the matter?

519
00:25:57,311 --> 00:26:01,947
Best belly rub I ever had.

520
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,534
Freedom!

521
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:10,172
I left a surprise in there
for animal control.

522
00:26:10,174 --> 00:26:12,991
I didn't peg you
for a softy.

523
00:26:12,993 --> 00:26:15,627
Going home. I'm going home.
Honey, I'm coming home.

524
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:17,045
Yeah,
I'm coming home.

525
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:18,347
I'm going home!

526
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:19,464
Bacon! Bacon! Bacon!
Bacon!

527
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,691
I'm sorry.

528
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:49,294
Who can afford to be closed
on Monday these days?

529
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:50,829
A homicidal maniac?

530
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:52,130
Yeah.

531
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:53,832
Hey.

532
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:11,850
Check this out.
Chef Leo.

533
00:27:11,852 --> 00:27:13,185
Think he's our guy?

534
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:15,103
It's Okie town.

535
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:17,856
Lots of dudes
wear cowboy hats.

536
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:28,283
Whoa.

537
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:33,288
Oxycodone,
tramadol, methadone.

538
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,507
Oh, guess he likes to cook
comfortably numb.

539
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:37,042
Yeah, apparently.

540
00:27:37,044 --> 00:27:38,677
Help us.

541
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:40,412
Please, mister.
Over here.

542
00:27:40,414 --> 00:27:41,713
Did you hear that?

543
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:46,084
Sounded like little kids.

544
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:51,390
Help. If you don't free us,
the chef will eat us.

545
00:27:51,392 --> 00:27:52,407
She's not lying.

546
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:55,727
We're in a cage!

547
00:27:59,232 --> 00:28:00,665
Eat you?

548
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,818
Look in the refrigerator
behind you.

549
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,537
Yeah, behind you.
In the fridge.

550
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:10,942
Hey.

551
00:28:10,944 --> 00:28:12,610
"Owl brains."

552
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:13,962
"Cheetah liver."

553
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:15,547
"Grizzly heart."

554
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:20,001
Ah, a spell book.
Shamanism.

555
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:22,671
Well, what's a chef doing
dabbling with witchcraft?

556
00:28:22,673 --> 00:28:24,222
It says here whatever
animal organ you ingest

557
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:27,559
with the right mix
of hoo doo and spices,

558
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:29,961
you temporarily gain the power
of that animal.

559
00:28:29,963 --> 00:28:34,099
So, okay, if you're munching
on owl brains...

560
00:28:34,101 --> 00:28:35,667
Your head spins around
like "The Exorcist"?

561
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:38,303
Close.
Bolsters your IQ.

562
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:42,174
Okay, eat a cheetah liver
for speed,

563
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:44,025
bear heart
for strength.

564
00:28:44,027 --> 00:28:45,727
Okay, so if he's chowing down
on this stuff --

565
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:46,678
Then it would make sense

566
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,179
why he constricted
the taxidermist

567
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:50,682
and clawed the guy
at the shelter.

568
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:53,285
Well, no offense, but why would
he want to eat you guys?

569
00:28:53,287 --> 00:28:55,003
Uh, we have
collapsible spines.

570
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:56,037
We do. Promise.

571
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,689
Look at this.
Hmm?

572
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:59,190
"Lion liver plus
eagle heart.

573
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:01,409
"Rattlesnake fangs plus
anaconda bladder.

574
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:03,495
Baboon brains plus
black widow abdomen."

575
00:29:03,497 --> 00:29:05,397
He's mixing ingredients.

576
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:06,715
What the hell for?

577
00:29:08,469 --> 00:29:10,602
Shoo! Quiet!

578
00:29:10,604 --> 00:29:12,721
Don't shush me!
You be quiet!

579
00:29:12,723 --> 00:29:16,558
I am quite. Now.

580
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:37,112
Who the hell are you?

581
00:29:37,114 --> 00:29:38,530
We're from
the health department.

582
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:40,064
Stopped by
for an inspection.

583
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:42,066
I wasn't aware
we had one scheduled.

584
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:45,253
Yeah, no, you wouldn't be.
That's the point.

585
00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:47,005
Besides,
I thought you were closed.

586
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:48,573
We are.
Chef's having a private dinner.

587
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:51,843
In fact,
he'll be here any minute.

588
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:54,796
Oh. Well, then. In that case,
kitchen's shut down.

589
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:57,098
Shut down? Why?

590
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,417
Because, uh, y-you're both
in clear violation

591
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:01,236
of penal code 8.14.

592
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:07,025
Out. Come on. Get out.

593
00:30:07,027 --> 00:30:10,262
Both of you.
We'll let you know.

594
00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:13,615
All right.

595
00:30:13,617 --> 00:30:15,099
I'll take the front.
You take the back.

596
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:16,768
Do we even know
how to kill this guy?

597
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,954
Well, empty one of these
in his head.

598
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:20,705
See what that does.

599
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:56,658
Aah!

600
00:31:00,948 --> 00:31:03,314
Chameleons aren't
that bad.

601
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:05,116
Kind of taste
like chicken.

602
00:31:30,293 --> 00:31:33,011
How the hell
did you do that?

603
00:31:33,013 --> 00:31:35,647
D-do what?

604
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:38,566
Don't play coy.
I want to know what you are.

605
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:43,688
Oh,
screw the sharktopus.

606
00:31:45,325 --> 00:31:47,459
You're my main course.

607
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:11,660
Why does it smell like dog
in here?

608
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:17,900
That smell's coming
from you.

609
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:35,684
All dogs
should be leashed.

610
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:46,745
What did you do
to my brother?

611
00:32:48,498 --> 00:32:51,450
Your brother?

612
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:53,502
What was your mom smoking
when she had you two?

613
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,287
He's fine.

614
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:57,589
He's just taking
a little cat nap before dinner.

615
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:59,458
I've never had human heart
before.

616
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,559
Heard it's a bit chewy.

617
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,594
Good job
I'm not a fussy eater.

618
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:06,965
You're sick.

619
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:09,718
Been told that
once or twice.

620
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,887
No, no.
Not in the head.

621
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,356
I, uh -- well,
you are that, too,

622
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:18,093
but I mean
sick like cancer.

623
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:24,099
Well, I guess dogs really can
sniff it out.

624
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:27,602
Stage IV carcinoma.

625
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:28,787
Huh.

626
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:30,622
So that's why
you're doing this.

627
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,658
What happened?

628
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,878
Draw the short straw,
decided to break bad?

629
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,379
See,
when I was diagnosed,

630
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:40,115
I was way past
standard treatment.

631
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:41,950
No one could save me.

632
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:44,286
But then with the help
of a Pawnee shaman

633
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:47,172
and a zoo membership,
I found a cure,

634
00:33:47,174 --> 00:33:50,175
albeit a temporary one.

635
00:33:50,177 --> 00:33:52,478
Cancer always came back.

636
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,648
You start experimenting
with different organs, huh?

637
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,152
Traded in the single serving
for a combo platter.

638
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:03,155
Well, what can I say?
Combination therapy works.

639
00:34:03,157 --> 00:34:05,140
I felt stronger,

640
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:09,027
and the effects
lasted longer.

641
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:12,531
And if you smoke a few innocent
people in the process,

642
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:15,617
well, hell,
at least you felt better.

643
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:19,755
Well, I didn't mean
to kill anyone -- at first.

644
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:25,761
But if people got in my way,
they became collateral damage.

645
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:30,098
Guess you eat enough predators,
you start to become one.

646
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,852
You are what you eat,
right?

647
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:36,388
Do you really think
the power you hold

648
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,006
over other people's lives

649
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:40,726
can make up for what you lack
in your own?

650
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:49,201
So, dog boy,

651
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:53,238
what do I need to eat
to take you down, huh?

652
00:34:56,326 --> 00:34:59,795
You don't
want to do this.

653
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:02,164
Oh, but I do
want to do this.

654
00:35:03,866 --> 00:35:07,719
See, I'm gonna kill you,
work up a nice appetite,

655
00:35:07,721 --> 00:35:11,890
and then I'm gonna eat
your brother.

656
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,812
I mean, I don't know
what the hell he is,

657
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:21,817
but with healing powers
like that, who cares?

658
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:25,654
He could cure me.

659
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:30,108
Ah.

660
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:35,531
Dog on sort-of dog.

661
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:44,923
<i>Rahuraar,</i>

662
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:50,745
<i>sakuriisat iisat</i>
<i>a ti'pah kaawakit.</i>

663
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:53,048
<i>'A tarahkista'u...</i>

664
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,386
<i>...a raah.</i>

665
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:27,266
Sorry.
Wolf trumps dog.

666
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,102
Maybe.
But not a whole pack.

667
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,000
Hey.

668
00:37:14,002 --> 00:37:17,187
For the love of God,
Sammy.

669
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:18,639
Hey, Sammy.

670
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:22,526
Zeke.

671
00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:24,027
Whoever the hell
you are.

672
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:26,280
Hey. Come on.

673
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:30,817
Don't make me lick
your damn face.

674
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:31,818
Hey.

675
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:43,580
Come on.

676
00:37:43,582 --> 00:37:45,632
When you called us
about adopting him,

677
00:37:45,634 --> 00:37:46,866
we couldn't
believe it.

678
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:48,635
Aren't you
the sweetest?

679
00:37:48,637 --> 00:37:50,003
Ugh.
Back off, tofu-breath.

680
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:52,872
Oh,
you must be starving.

681
00:37:52,874 --> 00:37:56,760
Lucky for you, I baked
some vegan doggy cupcakes.

682
00:38:02,184 --> 00:38:05,352
I'm gonna be pooping wheatgrass
with these two.

683
00:38:06,388 --> 00:38:07,887
Look, I know
they're hippie freaks,

684
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:09,189
but they're gonna give you
a good home --

685
00:38:09,191 --> 00:38:10,390
one that you deserve.

686
00:38:10,392 --> 00:38:12,326
Yeah, yeah.

687
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:15,028
Wish we could take you
on the road with us,

688
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,848
but it's no life
for a dog.

689
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,500
Don't sweat it.
I get carsick anyway.

690
00:38:20,502 --> 00:38:22,669
I was afraid to tell you
earlier,

691
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:24,121
but I barfed
in your backseat.

692
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:26,373
You...

693
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:28,258
What?

694
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:33,079
I'm gonna miss you,
buddy.

695
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:34,965
I'll miss you, too.

696
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:37,351
And by the way,
as an honorary dog,

697
00:38:37,353 --> 00:38:39,085
there's something
you should know.

698
00:38:39,087 --> 00:38:41,555
Dog's aren't really
man's best friend.

699
00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:43,473
What are you
talking about?

700
00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:45,559
I know it sounds
like a conspiracy theory,

701
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:47,778
but the real reason
we were put here was to...

702
00:38:50,149 --> 00:38:52,949
Put here to do what?

703
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,621
Oh, you got to be
kidding me.

704
00:38:57,623 --> 00:38:59,990
Oh, <i>now</i> the spell
wears off?!

705
00:39:05,713 --> 00:39:07,714
Okay.

706
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:15,656
How did it go?

707
00:39:15,658 --> 00:39:19,843
Well, bad news is
I'm gonna miss the flea bag.

708
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:21,395
Good news is

709
00:39:21,397 --> 00:39:23,797
it looks like the spell
is finally wearing off.

710
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,351
You okay?

711
00:39:27,353 --> 00:39:30,136
The Stetson man
got you pretty good.

712
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:31,238
Yeah, I'm fine.

713
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,973
I-I just, uh...

714
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:36,309
I can't stop thinking
about what he said.

715
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:37,778
Oh, come on, Sammy.

716
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,746
Guy was out of
his freaking gourd.

717
00:39:39,748 --> 00:39:44,251
Yeah, but, I mean,
why -- why would he ask that?

718
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:46,286
Why -- why did he want to know
what I was?

719
00:39:46,288 --> 00:39:49,122
Who the hell knows?

720
00:39:49,124 --> 00:39:51,425
He was all jacked up
on juice, you know?

721
00:39:51,427 --> 00:39:53,960
He was possessed by -- by
something he couldn't control.

722
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:56,163
It was...

723
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:03,003
It was just
a matter of time

724
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:05,939
before it
completely took over.

725
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:11,344
You can't reason with crazy,
right?

726
00:40:11,346 --> 00:40:13,847
I don't know.

727
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:15,982
Well, I do.

728
00:40:15,984 --> 00:40:18,685
Trust me, Sam.
You got nothing to worry about.

729
