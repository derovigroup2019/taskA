1
00:00:01,607 --> 00:00:02,940
Abaddon. She's a demon...

2
00:00:02,942 --> 00:00:05,176
Who, it turns out,
is a knight of hell.

3
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:07,311
Knights of Hell are
handpicked by Lucifer himself.

4
00:00:07,313 --> 00:00:08,612
I am your king.

5
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:09,680
About that...

6
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:15,720
Right now you and I are gonna
talk about regime change.

7
00:00:25,364 --> 00:00:26,364
How do I stop?

8
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:27,531
Just let it go.

9
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:30,634
We will figure it out.

10
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:32,436
Aah!
Sam?

11
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:35,906
Sammy's hurt.
He's hurt real bad.

12
00:00:35,908 --> 00:00:38,175
This one goes out to any angel
with their ears on.

13
00:00:38,177 --> 00:00:41,946
This is Dean Winchester...
And I need your help.

14
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:46,417
Easy there, brother.

15
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:54,225
I heard your prayer,
and I am here to help.

16
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:56,293
You want to help?
Start with a name.

17
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:57,762
Ezekiel.

18
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:07,405
No, we had a deal.
I fight. You save.

19
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:09,673
There is a chance I can fix
your brother from the inside.

20
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:12,343
How will it work?
I heal Sam while healing myself.

21
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:13,477
And when he's healed?

22
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,913
I leave.

23
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:17,314
He's gonna wake up, right?
He will.

24
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:18,616
So, what he does -- what,

25
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:21,085
is he gonna feel you inside,
triaging his spleen?

26
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:22,486
He will not feel me,
no.

27
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:24,789
There is no reason for him
to know I'm in here at all.

28
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:28,292
Without his acceptance,
Sam can eject me at any time.

29
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:30,861
And if Sam does eject me,
he will die.

30
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:33,297
Then we keep it a secret
for now.

31
00:01:56,021 --> 00:02:00,157
So, what, Cass is human?

32
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,192
Ish.

33
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:04,195
I mean, he's got no Grace,
no wings,

34
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:08,265
no...harp,
whatever the hell else he had.

35
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:09,066
Okay.

36
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,102
Where'd he crash-land?

37
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:13,437
Called me from a pay phone
from Longmont, Colorado.

38
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,272
I told him just to make
for the bunker.

39
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:17,241
Well, you think he can handle
a road trip like that?

40
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:18,976
Well, Cass is a big boy.

41
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:21,045
Things go breaking bad,
he knows our number.

42
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:23,481
Right now,
I got bigger worries.

43
00:02:23,483 --> 00:02:25,916
The Fallen Angels?

44
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:27,384
Yeah.

45
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:29,186
I mean,
thanks to Metatron,

46
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:31,622
we now have a couple of thousand
confused, loose nukes

47
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:33,624
walking around down here.

48
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:36,460
What do you think
they're gonna do?

49
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:39,864
I got no damn clue.

50
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:40,931
What about Crowley?

51
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:42,466
You, uh...

52
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:45,903
I would have loved
nothing better

53
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:48,005
than to ice
that limey bitch.

54
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:51,976
But then I thought to myself,
"what would Sam Winchester do?"

55
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:54,111
I'd have...

56
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:55,846
stabbed him in the brain.

57
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:57,481
Oh.

58
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:02,052
Well, I figured the King of Hell
might know a few things,

59
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:04,288
so why not "Zero Dark Thirty"
his ass?

60
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:08,526
Wait.

61
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:11,695
So, Crowley is alive?

62
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:14,498
Oh, yeah.

63
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,735
He's the junk in my trunk.

64
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:18,893

What the hell?

67
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:31,208
Dean?

68
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,043
You're alive.

69
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:34,712
Yeah, 'cause you're
a crappy shot...

70
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:36,547
Katniss.

71
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:38,082
Sorry.

72
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,451
It's been
a bad couple of days.

73
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:43,587
I-I haven't slept or eaten.

74
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,289
I'm pretty backed up.

75
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,257
Okay, over-share.

76
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,593
After we talked,
this place went nuts, all right?

77
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:52,129
T-there was some alarm, and all
the machines were freaking out.

78
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:53,997
And t-the bunker
just locked down.

79
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:55,699
I couldn't open the door.
My cellphone stopped working.

80
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:57,601
I thought
the world was ending.

81
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,337
Close.

82
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:03,907
The Angels fell.

83
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:06,343
What does that mean?

84
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:08,746
Nothing good.

85
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:13,517
Listen, next time
the world's ending, grab a gun.

86
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:20,557
I got service.

87
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:27,998
It's back online.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,901
Maybe when you opened the door
from the outside door,

89
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:31,969
it reset the system.

90
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:33,804
Yeah, okay.
Let's go with that.

91
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:37,441
Hey. All good?

92
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:41,378
Is it ever.
Come on.

93
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:50,354
No.

94
00:05:52,157 --> 00:05:53,524
Aah!

95
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:54,625
Hello.

96
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:58,996
Ah. Never get tired
of doing that.

97
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:04,902
Homey.

98
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:07,771
Where did you get this
fantastic little tree house?

99
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:10,007
All right,
here's how it's gonna go.

100
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:11,875
You're giving us the name
of every demon on Earth

101
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:13,310
and the people
they're possessing.

102
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,511
Am I?

103
00:06:14,513 --> 00:06:16,113
Doesn't sound like me.

104
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,048
I saw you break down,
Crowley.

105
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,817
When I was trying
to cure you,

106
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:22,453
I know a part of you was human
again, maybe still is.

107
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:24,621
Blah-blah. Boo-hoo.
Done?

108
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:28,492
Good.
'Cause this is what <i>I</i> know.

109
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:31,662
I'm not giving you anything.

110
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:33,330
Why would I?

111
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:35,399
You have no leverage,
darlings.

112
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:37,901
You're not gonna close the Gates
of Hell because you didn't.

113
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:40,103
You're not gonna kill me
because you haven't.

114
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:41,572
So, what's left?

115
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:43,941
We have a few ideas.

116
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:46,276
Torture?
Brilliant.

117
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:48,545
Can't wait to see Sam
in stilettos

118
00:06:48,547 --> 00:06:50,247
and a leather bustier

119
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:55,486
really putting the S-A-M
into S-and-M.

120
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:58,522
Honestly, boys,
what are you gonna do to me

121
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:02,626
that I don't do to myself just
for kicks every Friday night?

122
00:07:10,368 --> 00:07:12,436
Have fun.

123
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:27,451
Mm.

124
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:35,492
What's Crowley doing here?
Why isn't he dead?!

125
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:36,760
Why aren't you stabbing him
right now?!

126
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:38,195
All right, all right.
Chill out, Kevin, okay?

127
00:07:38,197 --> 00:07:39,162
We need him.
What?

128
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:41,331
Kevin, look,
if we can get Crowley

129
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,268
to give us the name
of every demon he's got topside,

130
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,603
we can hunt them down --
all of them.

131
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:48,438
He will break, okay?

132
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,108
And when he does, we'll hold him
down while you knife him.

133
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,610
Then we all go out
for ice cream and strippers.

134
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,781
Just stay away from him,
all right?

135
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:02,019
So, now what?
I got to make some phone calls.

136
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:03,787
You need to hit
the Angel tablet,

137
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:05,070
see if you can find anything
on the spell that Metatron

138
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:06,157
used to empty out heaven.

139
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:07,524
Yeah,
maybe we can reverse it

140
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:09,326
before the God squad
does too much damage.

141
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:10,427
Yeah, if we're lucky.

142
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:11,795
All right. Check the net
for anything angel-y.

143
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:12,896
Or demon-y.

144
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:14,731
Or monster-y
or ghost-y or --

145
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:17,334
It's gonna be a busy year.

146
00:08:19,638 --> 00:08:22,039
My name is Abaddon.

147
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,408
But enough about me.

148
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,909
Let's talk you.

149
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:27,377
Jason tells me

150
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,880
you're all violent,
power-hungry opportunists.

151
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:32,082
So,
maybe you can tell me

152
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:37,054
what the hell
happened to Hell.

153
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:39,256
And demons. I mean...

154
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:41,191
You call that a meat suit?

155
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:45,729
I closed 72 deals
last year.

156
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:47,164
Kids love grandma.

157
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,432
And that's the problem.

158
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:51,001
Deals.

159
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:55,439
We're paying
for what we should be taking.

160
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,576
Who put Crowley in charge?

161
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:03,113
What's the matter?
Hellhound got your tongue?

162
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:04,081
You took orders from him!

163
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,382
He's the King.

164
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:08,285
He's a salesman.

165
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:10,120
A king fights.

166
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:12,856
A king conquers.

167
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:19,096
A king does more than sit around
reading contracts.

168
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:22,432
But the King's dead.

169
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,368
Long live the Queen.

170
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,337
I can train you.

171
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:28,805
I can get you new bodies.

172
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:30,207
And we will march into Hell,

173
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:32,442
where we will be greeted
as liberators,

174
00:09:32,444 --> 00:09:36,146
and demonkind will rise up
and sweep over the Earth.

175
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:37,247
And all the humans

176
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:39,583
and all the Angels,
with their clipped wings,

177
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:44,821
will bow to me,
or they will burn.

178
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:46,223
What about Crowley?

179
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:49,092
Crowley's dead.

180
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:51,662
Uh-huh.

181
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:55,666
Well, uh, n-no offense,
honey,

182
00:09:55,668 --> 00:09:58,402
but we all thought you were dead
until, like, a week ago.

183
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:02,072
And what if Crowley
<i>does</i> come back?

184
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:04,841
Look, a lot of us
were scared of him.

185
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,943
A lot of us still are.

186
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:10,280
Prove that Crowley's
really gone,

187
00:10:10,282 --> 00:10:13,884
and then maybe this scheme
of yours will work.

188
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:17,721
Or not.

189
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:23,593
Honestly, I always thought
you Knights were overrated.

190
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:31,835
You go to hell,
and you tell them I'm coming.

191
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:37,407
Yeah, Irv.
Fallen Angels.

192
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,242
Huh.
That's a wrinkle.

193
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:41,778
Well, trust me, they're
just monsters with good P.R.

194
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,048
So, if you run into one,
torch his ass with holy oil.

195
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,685
Oh, and if they drop, uh, like,
a silver sword, grab it.

196
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:50,487
Those pig-stickers
come in handy.

197
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:51,922
Okay. Criminy.

198
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:53,790
Hey, look,
I know this is weird, but --

199
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,425
Hell, Dean-o,
weird's what we do.

200
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:58,028
I remember this case me and
Bobby worked up in Saskatoon.

201
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,930
Had these two --
the werewolf siamese twins.

202
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:02,032
He told you about that?

203
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:04,634
Every time
he drank Labatt's.

204
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:06,970
So, if you run into
any problems, give a call, okay?

205
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:08,305
And, uh, spread the word.

206
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:10,407
The more hunters that know, the better.
Roger-Dodger.

207
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:19,649
So, this is your first
weekend pass into town, right?

208
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,151
So, I set it all up.

209
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:22,637
Jamie's waiting at the bar
and has a thing...

210
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:23,621
Mm-hmm.

211
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:24,621
...for men in uniform.

212
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:26,123
So,
you just start buying shots,

213
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,958
then you can thank me
in the morning.

214
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,092
Cool.

215
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:02,626
Now, <i>that</i> is more like it.

216
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:31,265
Need some help?

217
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:34,068
Um, yeah.
I-I-I-I don't know.

218
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,171
I...think the thingy broke.

219
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,007
Well, I could give you
a lift into town.

220
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,010
That would be amazing.

221
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,745
Thanks.

222
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:04,031
? Oh, rockin' down the highway ?

223
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:10,705
? Oh,
rockin' down the highway ?

224
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:13,574
? Oh...

225
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:15,176
Nice hunting.

226
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:22,149
Oh, God.

227
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:24,418
This place reeks of sulfur.

228
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,021
Between the stink,
with the freak thunderstorms,

229
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,790
and every cow dead
within three miles,

230
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,492
I'll take demons
for $1,000, Alex.

231
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:36,097
Hey.
Agents Stark and Banner, FBI.

232
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:37,431
Just need to have
a look around.

233
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:40,735
Why? This is a military case,
not a federal one.

234
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,403
Well, that's not
what our supervisor said.

235
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,537
That so?

236
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:45,873
Then maybe him and I
ought to have a chat.

237
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,008
Hmm.

238
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:49,110
Okay.

239
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:56,317
Hey.

240
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:58,319
Hey, boss. Uh, we got
a little problem here.

241
00:13:58,321 --> 00:13:59,687
"Boss"?

242
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:01,222
Yeah, just a local badge
needs confirmation

243
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:02,390
we're supposed to be here...

244
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:05,993
How the word came down
from FBI headquarters in D.C.

245
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:08,129
Wait, w-what?
Yeah.

246
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:13,134
This is
Sergeant Miranda Bates.

247
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:14,835
Who am I talking to?

248
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:18,539
Uh, Kevin...Solo.

249
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:23,377
How old are you?

250
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:25,713
Old enough.

251
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:28,616
And I'm with the FBI, so you
have to do what I say or --

252
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,583
Listen, kid.

253
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:30,951
I don't have to do anything,

254
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,353
and I don't take orders
from the Feeb,

255
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,854
so unless you can give me
one good reason

256
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:35,356
you got a couple
of pretty-boy agents

257
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:36,991
poking around my crime scene,

258
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:39,427
I'm gonna put them in cuffs
and spank your ass raw.

259
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:41,629
Understand?

260
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,164
Cabo last June.

261
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,265
What?

262
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,367
That's my reason.

263
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:50,104
Oh, my favorite's
you in a sombrero

264
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,640
doing a body shot off some
naked guy in a Luchador mask.

265
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,075
Super-classy.

266
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:55,309
How did you find that?

267
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:59,113
'Cause I'm
Kevin frigging Solo.

268
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,948
So, unless you want this
forwarded

269
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,451
to your commanding officer,
Major Velasquez,

270
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,219
I suggest you give my guys
anything they want.

271
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:06,754
You understand?

272
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:08,522
Yes.

273
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,458
"Yes...Sir."

274
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,993
Yes, sir.

275
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,004
Kevin?

276
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,806
What the hell
did you just do?

277
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:29,710
All military computers
are linked to the same network.

278
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:30,644
And?

279
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:32,580
I hacked it.

280
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:34,949
Hey, Kevin.

281
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:36,350
Good job, buddy.

282
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:43,357
Hey. Anything?

283
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,426
Yeah, this guy was shot
in the heart.

284
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:47,061
That what killed him?

285
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:49,029
Maybe --
15, 20 years ago.

286
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,099
Every one of these bodies has
a fatal wound or two or three,

287
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,067
but they're all old.

288
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:54,535
So,
we're looking at meatsuits?

289
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,537
The bodies took a licking,

290
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,773
and the demon inside
kept them ticking.

291
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:00,040
Probably.

292
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,511
I think they were possessed,
and now those soldiers are.

293
00:16:03,513 --> 00:16:04,745
Hey.

294
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,514
Excuse me, agents.

295
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:08,282
We pulled this off
a security camera.

296
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:09,784
You might want to take a look.

297
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:20,661
Abaddon? Seriously?

298
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:21,883
Thought you Kentucky fried
that meatsuit.

299
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:22,998
I did, Dean.

300
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:24,665
You -- well, then,
how did she get it back?

301
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,599
Thank you.

302
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:27,101
And why's she playing
G.I. Joe?

303
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:29,336
No clue. Why don't you ask her
when we find her?

304
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:33,474
Oh, I will. Then I'm gonna chop
her freakin' head off -- again.

305
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:40,114
All right, Pete.

306
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:42,817
The Winchesters --
where are they?

307
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:45,119
Bite me.

308
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:48,722
I said
where are the Winchesters?

309
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:52,092
And I said bite me,
crew cut.

310
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,430
Let me show you how it's done,
boys.

311
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:06,073
- Help me!
- Help!

312
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:09,510
You can scream
all you want to.

313
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:12,413
No one's gonna hear you!

314
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:16,817
Now,
let's talk Sam and Dean.

315
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,826
Hello?

316
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:29,830
This is Dean's number,
but you're not a Winchester.

317
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:31,499
Who are you?

318
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:34,635
I'm nobody.

319
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,937
Well, nobody...

320
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:40,608
I need you to give those boys
a message for me.

321
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,744
I have something
they might want.

322
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:50,451
Kevin, wait. Wait. Wait.
Slow down.

323
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:57,224
She gave me these coordinates --
44.053051 by -123.127860 --

324
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,527
and two names,
Irv Franklin and Tracy Bell.

325
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,428
Irv's a friend.
Don't know Tracy.

326
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,163
All right, the lady said
they were hunters

327
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,933
and that if you didn't go save
them, that she would kill them.

328
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:07,735
Yeah, I've heard
that song before.

329
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:08,836
Dean, who was she?

330
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:09,870
She's the bad guy.

331
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:11,205
All right, new job.

332
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:13,440
Dig up everything men of letters
have on Knights of Hell.

333
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:15,776
Knights of Hell?
Sure.

334
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,077
You find a way
to kill one --

335
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,547
I mean permanently --
drop a dime.

336
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:20,848
Thanks, Kevin.

337
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:27,421
The numbers point to a spot on
the outskirts of Eugene, Oregon.

338
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:29,890
You know
this is a trap, right?

339
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:31,358
Yep.

340
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,193
And we're just gonna walk
right into it?

341
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,495
Guns blazing.

342
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:35,763
You with me?

343
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,333
You know it.

344
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:49,777
<i>You're the third trial,</i>
<i>Crowley.</i>

345
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:53,581
<i>Where do I start...</i>

346
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,516
<i>You're our bitch.</i>

347
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:58,419
<i>...to even look</i>
<i>for forgiveness?</i>

348
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:00,020
<i>Your demon ass</i>

349
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,556
<i>is going to be a mortal ass</i>
<i>pretty damn quick.</i>

350
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,191
<i>None of this</i>
<i>means anything to you?</i>

351
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:05,626
<i>You're my Marnie, moose.</i>

352
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:09,063
<i>A-and Hannah -- she just --</i>
<i>she needs to be loved.</i>

353
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,230
She deserves it.

354
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,632
We deserve to be loved.

355
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:13,567
I deserve to be loved!

356
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:15,903
I just want to be loved.

357
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,406
<i>I just want to be loved.</i>

358
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:32,486
Kevin?

359
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:36,857
Kevin, I know it's you.

360
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:40,995
I'd recognize the pitter-patter
of those little feet anywhere.

361
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:43,764
That's right.

362
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,732
Run.

363
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:46,900
It's what you do.

364
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:50,404
I understand. I do.

365
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:52,406
You're --

366
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,475
what's the word? --

367
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:56,577
weak.

368
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,489
Hiya, Kev.

369
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:10,991
The hell happened here?

370
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:13,961
A local chemical plant
sprung a leak years ago.

371
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,596
They evacuated
three square blocks.

372
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:16,897
Guess
it's still contaminated.

373
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:19,500
Wait, so this whole place
is poison?

374
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:20,901
Yeah.

375
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,907
That's not gonna help.

376
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:30,110
It doesn't hurt.

377
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:46,160
Dean.

378
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,429
Irv? Hey.

379
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,931
Where's Abaddon?

380
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,800
Abaddon's
been torturing hunters.

381
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:54,868
She's trying to get intel
on you boys.

382
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,104
Do you know why?
I seriously doubt

383
00:20:57,106 --> 00:20:58,639
she wants to add you
to her Christmas-card list.

384
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:00,908
Now, do you want to make
with the rescue or what?

385
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,943
Right after you take a shot
of holy water, huh?

386
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,484
Happy?

387
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:12,586
- Sorry about that.
- Don't worry about it.

388
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:15,022
Last thing you need
is us popping black eyes.

389
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,060
You're Tracy, right?
I'm Sam Winchester.

390
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,495
Good for you.

391
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:24,631
She's new.

392
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:27,301
We did a shifter job
in Sacramento together.

393
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:30,504
Smart,
but got a mouth on her.

394
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:34,141
Let's gear up.

395
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:39,279
So, what brings you
to my boudoir, handsome?

396
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:40,948
You're gonna tell me
how to kill a Knight of Hell.

397
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,484
Abaddon
giving you trouble, eh?

398
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:45,619
Tell you what.

399
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:48,288
You let me go, and I'll spit
roast the little whore for you.

400
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,556
Sound good?

401
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,024
You're bluffing.

402
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,359
You don't know.

403
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:53,994
Oh, I know plenty.

404
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:56,363
For example,
I know she'd love you --

405
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:58,766
skinny, submissive.

406
00:21:58,768 --> 00:22:00,334
You're just her type.

407
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:01,835
Shut up.

408
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:03,070
Fine.

409
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,305
That's not what you came for
anyway -- not really.

410
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:10,477
What's on your mind,
Kevin?

411
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,079
You can tell me.

412
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,347
We're friends.

413
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:14,748
You tortured me.

414
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,151
I torture all my friends.

415
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:19,319
It's how I show love.

416
00:22:21,022 --> 00:22:24,191
I was raised in a dysfunctional
home environment.

417
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:25,759
You killed my mom!

418
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,427
Did I?

419
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:31,865
I mean, are you sure?

420
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,267
Did you ever see a body?

421
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,736
I mean, how could you be sure
she's dead?

422
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:36,937
Aah!

423
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:45,846
You can do better than that,
little man.

424
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:52,820
That's right.

425
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:54,922
Let it all out.

426
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:55,956
Aah!

427
00:23:03,994 --> 00:23:06,062
All right,
we got Jesus juice,

428
00:23:06,064 --> 00:23:08,164
guns loaded
with Devil's Trap bullets.

429
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,099
Shoot a demon,
put him on lockdown.

430
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:12,234
The angel blade works.

431
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:16,405
They're coming.

432
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:18,007
Good.

433
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:20,409
They've got
assault rifles.

434
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:23,012
Okay, less good.

435
00:23:23,014 --> 00:23:26,515
So, what's the play?

436
00:23:28,618 --> 00:23:31,087
Come and get it,
you dicks!

437
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:35,191
Down now!

438
00:23:35,193 --> 00:23:39,762
<i>Come and get it,</i>
<i>you dicks!</i>

439
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:42,064
<i>Come and get it,</i>
<i>you dicks!</i>

440
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,432
Damn it.

441
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:44,567
All right.

442
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:46,335
We got to flank SEAL team douche
in there, so, uh,

443
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:47,903
Irv, you and me
will go left.

444
00:23:47,905 --> 00:23:49,472
Sam,
you and Tracy go right.

445
00:23:49,474 --> 00:23:51,140
Okay.
Let's move.

446
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:53,976
Don't touch me.

447
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:56,078
Whoa.
What's the problem?

448
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:59,348
My family's dead
because of him.

449
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,217
What?

450
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:04,553
I watched a demon
slaughter my parents,

451
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:07,623
and the whole time, it talked
about how it was celebrating.

452
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,893
How some dumb kid
let Lucifer out of his cage.

453
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,664
Okay,
all right, we got to move.

454
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,134
Uh, girl's with me.
Irv.

455
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:20,870
Okay.
Let's go, son.

456
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:29,011
There.

457
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:33,549
Now that you've felt your feels,
maybe we can talk.

458
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:35,484
No.

459
00:24:35,486 --> 00:24:37,686
I'm gonna make this simple,
Kevin.

460
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:40,256
Let me go...

461
00:24:40,258 --> 00:24:42,892
And I'll give you back
your mother.

462
00:24:42,894 --> 00:24:44,059
She's dead.

463
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:46,162
Oh, she wishes she was.

464
00:24:46,164 --> 00:24:49,532
After what I had my heavies do
to her, she's begging for it.

465
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:55,137
But when have you ever known me
to let anyone off easy?

466
00:24:57,107 --> 00:25:02,077
You think Sam and Dean
care about her? Huh?

467
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,846
You think
they care about you?

468
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:08,484
You're just here
to serve their needs.

469
00:25:08,486 --> 00:25:10,286
Nothing more.

470
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:12,488
You're gonna lose, Kevin.

471
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,890
Everything.

472
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:17,526
It's just a matter of time.

473
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:20,462
When the Winchesters
are done with you,

474
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:22,998
they'll toss you aside
without a second thought

475
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,367
because they can.

476
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:27,303
Because they think
they're special.

477
00:25:27,305 --> 00:25:29,471
And because, well...

478
00:25:29,473 --> 00:25:35,177
There's always another Prophet
waiting in the wings.

479
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,516
I'm the one in chains,
but...

480
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:42,484
We're both prisoners here.

481
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:49,658
What say you let me go and we
walk out those doors together?

482
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:55,164
What say we both win?

483
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:05,441
Okay, I think
they're still inside.

484
00:26:05,443 --> 00:26:08,978
We wait till they come out,
and we pick them off one by one.

485
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:12,281
Listen, for the record,

486
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:15,251
Sam's not the only guy
who thought he was doing right

487
00:26:15,253 --> 00:26:17,253
and watched it
all go to crap.

488
00:26:17,255 --> 00:26:19,288
Okay?
That's just part of being --

489
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,990
Being a hunter.

490
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:22,825
Being human.

491
00:26:22,827 --> 00:26:24,860
Look, you want to be pissed off
at Sam, that's fine. I get it.

492
00:26:24,862 --> 00:26:26,795
But if you want to
go after somebody,

493
00:26:26,797 --> 00:26:28,731
you make sure
that they got black eyes.

494
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,300
Got to know who the real
monsters are in this world, kid.

495
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:42,111
Sam, you copacetic?

496
00:26:42,113 --> 00:26:44,079
Yeah.

497
00:26:44,081 --> 00:26:45,180
Good.

498
00:26:45,182 --> 00:26:46,448
Now hand me that toothpick

499
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,118
and you and Dean and Tracy --
you beat feet out of here.

500
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,153
What?
I'm going in there alone.

501
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:52,621
I'll buy you as much time
as I can.

502
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:54,290
Irv, that's death.

503
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:57,326
Yeah, well,
it's what I got coming.

504
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:02,298
It's my fault, Sam.

505
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,969
I was in some dive
and I was sloppy and lonely

506
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:09,171
and I met some girl,
and the next thing you know,

507
00:27:09,173 --> 00:27:10,506
I'm strapped to some bed

508
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:12,641
and she's twisting things that
ain't supposed to be twisted.

509
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:14,610
"She" who?

510
00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:16,078
Abaddon.

511
00:27:18,014 --> 00:27:20,149
I gave 'em up.

512
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:23,786
Pete, Tracy --
I gave 'em all up.

513
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:25,754
So you hand me that blade

514
00:27:25,756 --> 00:27:27,723
and you let me do what I got to
do, or so help me --

515
00:27:43,306 --> 00:27:44,473
Boo.

516
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:56,985
Nice grouping.

517
00:27:56,987 --> 00:28:00,089
Kevlar.
Beats magic bullets.

518
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:02,091
I love the future.

519
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:06,161
Listen,
my car is three blocks over.

520
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:08,197
Go get more bullets, more
holy water -- get everything.

521
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:10,132
No, no, b-but what about you?
Just go! Go! Now!

522
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:21,443
Alone at last.

523
00:28:36,877 --> 00:28:39,077
I missed you.

524
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,712
Did you miss me?

525
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:55,460
Cool.
I didn't miss the best part.

526
00:28:59,332 --> 00:29:02,034
So appreciate you boys
coming when I call.

527
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:05,070
I think that's what I like most
about you Winchesters.

528
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:07,105
You're so obedient.

529
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:09,408
And suicidally stupid.

530
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,243
I like that, too.

531
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:12,878
Are we gonna fight
or make out?

532
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,047
'Cause I'm getting
some real mixed signals here.

533
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:18,116
I want Crowley --
or what's left of him.

534
00:29:18,118 --> 00:29:19,585
Yeah?
What's in it for me?

535
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:21,653
I let you die.

536
00:29:21,655 --> 00:29:22,654
You give me Crowley's head,

537
00:29:22,656 --> 00:29:24,356
and I will snap your neck
quick and clean.

538
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:26,124
You won't feel a thing,
trust me.

539
00:29:26,126 --> 00:29:27,693
And if I tell you
to get bent?

540
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:28,727
Oh.

541
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:31,496
Well...

542
00:29:31,498 --> 00:29:36,668
You know, I've loved this body
since the moment I first saw it.

543
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,171
You're the perfect vessel,
Dean.

544
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:42,541
You give a girl
all sorts of nasty ideas.

545
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:45,477
So go ahead
and play hard to get,

546
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:49,147
and I'll peel off this
"no demons allowed" tattoo

547
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:50,949
and blow smoke up your ass.

548
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:53,051
Oh...

549
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:54,920
Well, I got to tell you,
between you and me,

550
00:29:54,922 --> 00:29:56,355
it is a horror show
up there.

551
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:58,290
It can get worse.

552
00:29:58,292 --> 00:29:59,725
Trust me.

553
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:01,627
'Cause once I'm on top,
I'll make you watch.

554
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:05,497
And I'll use your body.

555
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,933
Have you ever felt an infant's
blood drip down your chin?

556
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:10,869
Or listen to a girl scream
as you rip her guts out?

557
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:12,671
Because you will.

558
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:14,840
You and me, lover.

559
00:30:14,842 --> 00:30:17,643
And we'll have
a grand old time.

560
00:30:22,548 --> 00:30:23,682
And here I thought

561
00:30:23,684 --> 00:30:25,684
all you Winchesters
were supposed to be tough.

562
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:49,975
An Angel?

563
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:51,510
What, you think we'd roll up
to this mouse trap

564
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:53,011
without some backup?

565
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:18,637
They were going to kill him,
Dean.

566
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:23,442
Ezekiel?

567
00:31:23,444 --> 00:31:25,944
What the hell did you do?

568
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:30,482
I was protecting
your brother.

569
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:33,418
I thought
that was what you wanted.

570
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,220
Yeah.

571
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:37,489
Right, yeah, no, I-I --
sorry.

572
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:39,491
I'm just still getting used to
this whole thing.

573
00:31:39,493 --> 00:31:42,594
As am I.

574
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:45,330
But Sam's okay?

575
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:47,766
He was knocked unconscious.

576
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:49,701
In a way, he still is.

577
00:31:49,703 --> 00:31:53,071
Sam will not remember
any of this.

578
00:31:53,073 --> 00:31:57,175
So what the hell am I supposed
to tell him when he comes to?

579
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:03,348
That was why
I used the knife.

580
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,841
Right.

581
00:32:07,588 --> 00:32:09,588
Smart.

582
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,357
You are troubled still.

583
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:15,293
Yeah,
it's just that, uh...

584
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,063
Yeah, this is on me.

585
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:23,168
I was the one who talked Sam
out of boarding up hell.

586
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,870
Okay,
so every demon deal,

587
00:32:24,872 --> 00:32:28,106
every -- every kill
that they make,

588
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:30,308
well, you're looking
at the person who let it happen.

589
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,444
You were protecting
your brother.

590
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:35,213
I am in Sam's head.

591
00:32:35,215 --> 00:32:38,250
Everything he knows,
I know.

592
00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:44,790
And I know that what you did,
you did out of love.

593
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:47,959
Yeah.

594
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:49,895
Uh, look, Zeke --
I'm gonna call you Zeke --

595
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:55,634
I'm not really with the whole,
uh, love and...love.

596
00:32:55,636 --> 00:32:57,936
But it is why I said yes.

597
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:00,305
Yeah, and if that goes sideways,
that's on me, too.

598
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:02,507
That is not
going to happen.

599
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:05,844
This is nuts.

600
00:33:05,846 --> 00:33:08,113
I mean, you're Sam,
but you're not Sam,

601
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:11,616
and normally he's the one I'm
talking to about all this stuff.

602
00:33:13,486 --> 00:33:15,854
I'm trusting you, Zeke.

603
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,793
I just got to hope that you're
one of the good guys.

604
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:25,130
I am.

605
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:32,737
But I suppose that is
what a bad guy would say.

606
00:33:34,741 --> 00:33:40,045
Dean Winchester,
you are doing the right thing.

607
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:56,461
Sam? Sammy?

608
00:33:56,463 --> 00:33:57,996
Hey. Whoa.

609
00:33:57,998 --> 00:34:01,366
Dean?
What the hell happened?

610
00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:03,201
You took a shot to the head,

611
00:34:03,203 --> 00:34:06,304
and I came in and saved
your ass, like usual.

612
00:34:06,306 --> 00:34:07,973
You killed three demons?

613
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:09,307
Alone?

614
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:10,542
I took them by surprise.

615
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:13,111
Got a little messy.
I got a little lucky.

616
00:34:13,113 --> 00:34:14,846
Oh, and, uh...

617
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:17,582
I'm awesome,
so there's that.

618
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:18,817
Geez.

619
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:19,751
Yeah.

620
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:21,453
Whew.
You <i>are</i> pretty damn awesome.

621
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:34,032
Hey. You okay?

622
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:36,001
Yeah. You?

623
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:38,436
More or less, yeah.

624
00:34:38,438 --> 00:34:40,805
Good.

625
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,510
I got everything,
but guess I'm late to the party.

626
00:34:45,512 --> 00:34:46,978
Lucky you.

627
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,648
Let's blow
this toxic waste dump.

628
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:54,352
Burgers and silkwood showers
on me.

629
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:10,490
Kevin!

630
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:14,261
Kevin?

631
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:36,250
Who worked you over?

632
00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:39,787
Martin Hayward
and Brandon Favors.

633
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,657
They did this to you?

634
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:46,193
No. They're demons.

635
00:35:46,195 --> 00:35:48,596
You asked for names,
I'm giving you names.

636
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:52,266
They're underperformers.

637
00:35:52,268 --> 00:35:54,301
Spike them,
you're doing me a favor.

638
00:35:54,303 --> 00:35:56,103
Wow.
You break easy.

639
00:35:56,105 --> 00:35:57,504
Please.

640
00:35:57,506 --> 00:36:02,710
Your little plan to have me stew
in my own delicious juices --

641
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:04,378
pathetic.

642
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,946
You want intel.

643
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:08,048
I want things, too.

644
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:13,354
Maybe we can come
to some kind of arrangement.

645
00:36:13,356 --> 00:36:15,756
Quid pro quo, gentlemen.

646
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:18,292
So, these are what, then?
Freebies?

647
00:36:18,294 --> 00:36:19,260
Not at all.

648
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:21,262
You can consider them
fair trade

649
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:24,531
for the enjoyment
that Kevin gave me.

650
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,066
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

651
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:29,103
He's my new favorite toy.

652
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:33,040
Wind him up,
watch him go.

653
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:38,479
You check the names.
I'll go find the kid.

654
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,100
Where do you think
you're going?

655
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:02,870
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey!

656
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:04,505
Whoa, whoa.
Talk to me.

657
00:37:04,507 --> 00:37:06,407
You can't keep me
locked in here. I'm leaving.

658
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:07,942
Like hell.

659
00:37:07,944 --> 00:37:09,743
Man, we told you
not to talk to Crowley, okay?

660
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:11,278
He messes with your head.

661
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,646
He said my mom's alive.

662
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:17,151
Crowley said if I let him go,
he'd give her back to me.

663
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:19,119
And you believed him?

664
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:21,188
He's still in there,
isn't he?

665
00:37:23,224 --> 00:37:24,758
Crowley's lying.

666
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
And if he's not?

667
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:29,196
Well...

668
00:37:29,198 --> 00:37:31,932
If she <i>is</i> alive,
then she's dead.

669
00:37:31,934 --> 00:37:34,635
In every way that matters,
she's dead, Kevin.

670
00:37:34,637 --> 00:37:36,403
I'm sorry.

671
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:40,607
I know you're dying to bolt,
man.

672
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:42,443
I get it.

673
00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:46,613
But out that door,
it's demons and it's angels,

674
00:37:46,615 --> 00:37:49,917
and they would all love to get
their hands on a Prophet,

675
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:52,252
so even with Crowley here,

676
00:37:52,254 --> 00:37:54,455
this is still the safest place
for you.

677
00:37:54,457 --> 00:37:57,224
It just is.

678
00:37:57,226 --> 00:38:00,160
And we need you, man.

679
00:38:00,162 --> 00:38:02,596
'Cause I'm useful.

680
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:04,531
Because you're family.

681
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:08,068
After all the crap
we've been through,

682
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,537
after all the good
that you've done...

683
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:14,575
Man, if you don't think
that we would die for you...

684
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:17,778
I don't know
what to tell you.

685
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:23,117
Because you, me,
Sam, and Cass --

686
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,852
we are all we've got.

687
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:29,456
But, hey,
if none of that matters to you,

688
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,358
then I won't stop you.

689
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,601
Kevin's passed out
in one of the back rooms.

690
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:43,570
He's a tough kid.

691
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:46,173
He'll bounce back.

692
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,979
What's up with you?

693
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:55,616
Nothing.

694
00:38:55,618 --> 00:38:58,218
It's just...

695
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,854
What Tracy said about me --

696
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:04,825
she wasn't wrong.

697
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:09,163
Sam, listen to me.

698
00:39:09,165 --> 00:39:12,466
You have helped a hell of a lot
more people than you have hurt.

699
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:17,304
So all of that --
that was then.

700
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:19,540
Okay?

701
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:22,009
Here's to now.

702
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,148
So, you ready for it?

703
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,850
Hmm?

704
00:39:29,852 --> 00:39:31,251
The Fallen Angels?

705
00:39:31,253 --> 00:39:32,419
Abaddon?

706
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:34,021
Cass losing his halo?

707
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:36,423
Crowley in our basement?

708
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,827
Crap. We're living
in a freakin' sitcom.

709
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,396
What about you?

710
00:39:42,398 --> 00:39:45,899
How's the, uh,
the engine running?

711
00:39:45,901 --> 00:39:51,572
Honestly, um...I feel better
than I have in a long time.

712
00:39:51,574 --> 00:39:53,707
I mean, I realize it's crazy
out there

713
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:55,676
and we have trouble
coming for us,

714
00:39:55,678 --> 00:39:59,279
but I look around
and I see friends and family.

715
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:05,619
I am happy with my life
for the first time in...

716
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:07,754
Forever.

717
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,325
I-I am.
I really am.

718
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:14,328
I-it's just things are...

719
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,896
things are good.

720
00:40:20,202 --> 00:40:23,470
Never better.

721
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:28,495
