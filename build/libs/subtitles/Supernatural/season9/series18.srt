1
00:00:02,372 --> 00:00:03,906
Dean, I-I could really use
your help down here.

2
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:05,274
I'm getting close, Sam.

3
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:07,576
I can't drop the ball on Abaddon
right now.

4
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:09,144
I can give you the mark, Dean,
if it's what you truly want.

5
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:12,714
But you have to know with
the mark comes a great burden.

6
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:14,249
What is it you want of me,
Metatron?

7
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,651
Rebuild heaven.

8
00:00:15,653 --> 00:00:18,320
You want to be
my second-in-command,

9
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:19,788
prove you're ready.

10
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,593
Gadreel, we are writing
our own epic story here.

11
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:28,330
I got my Grace back.

12
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:30,399
Not mine per se,
but it'll do.

13
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:33,769
Angels fighting Angels
has to stop somewhere.

14
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:37,840
You've showed me
that there is a choice.

15
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:39,141
I'm no leader.

16
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:40,109
I will follow you.

17
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:42,544
And I am not
the only one.

18
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,713
What makes a story work?

19
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:23,085
Is it the plot, the characters,
the text?

20
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:26,588
The subtext?

21
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:31,160
And who gives a story meaning?

22
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:32,561
Is the writer?

23
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:38,200
Or you?

24
00:01:38,202 --> 00:01:42,604
Tonight, I thought
I would tell you a little story

25
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:46,942
and let you decide.

26
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:50,944

28
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:25,580
Yeah. All right.

29
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:26,982
Thanks, Carlos.

30
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:29,351
Listen, you, uh, if you catch wind of
any other demon activity,

31
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:31,687
give me a holler,
all right?

32
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:33,255
Appreciate it.

33
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:34,856
Hey.

34
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:35,924
Anything?

35
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:37,025
Yeah.

36
00:02:37,027 --> 00:02:38,994
A dozen demon-related cases,

37
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:41,897
people without souls acting out,
but...

38
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,398
But no sign of Abaddon.

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,467
Right.
Looks like she's vanished.

40
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:46,968
Well, we just got to
keep digging.

41
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,171
Right.

42
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:51,540
You okay?

43
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:53,041
Yeah. I'm fine.

44
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,844
Let's get to work.

45
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:57,646
All right.

46
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:13,722
Please -- please don't!

47
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:14,589
Don't hurt me.

48
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,724
I'm not gonna hurt you.

49
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:18,760
It's okay.

50
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:22,697
What's your name?

51
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,200
Hannah.

52
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:29,271
H-Hannah,
what happened here?

53
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:37,612
Yeah, I -- I heard it, too.
What was it?

54
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:40,782
I don't know.

55
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:46,087
It, uh,
it sounded familiar.

56
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,422
It sounded like heaven.

57
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:51,760
It's so strange
down here.

58
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:54,663
I, uh, followed the tone

59
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:57,499
and found so many of my brothers
and sisters had, as well.

60
00:04:57,501 --> 00:05:00,469
It felt safe here,

61
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:04,473
and then the doors slammed shut
and a strange angel arrived.

62
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:07,108
He said he worked
for the new God.

63
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,077
For Metatron?

64
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,645
Mm-hmm.

65
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:14,049
He made us an offer --

66
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:18,253
join Metatron,
fight for him,

67
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:21,556
and those that did would one day
be allowed to return to heaven.

68
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:22,657
Return to heaven?

69
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:28,730
I didn't believe him, either.

70
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:31,800
But he said
he would take us home.

71
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:34,903
Some angels joined him.

72
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:40,542
My friends and I refused,
and, uh...

73
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:44,012
I'm sorry for your loss.

74
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:49,351
For all our loss.

75
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:03,098
You're Castiel,
aren't you?

76
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,699
Yes.

77
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:07,269
You took a stand
against Bartholomew.

78
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:10,639
Are you going to help us,
lead us against Metatron?

79
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:11,606
I'm no leader.

80
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:12,941
But you --

81
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:15,443
I am no leader, Hannah.

82
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:18,914
But I will find Metatron,
and I make him pay.

83
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,483
Let me help you.

84
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:23,184
Let us help you.

85
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:26,021
You are safer
away from me.

86
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:29,724
Now, this angel
who attacked you,

87
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:31,393
what was his name?

88
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:32,260
Gadreel?

89
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:35,330
Gadreel is working
for Metatron?

90
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:37,499
For how long?
I don't know.

91
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:42,904
So, Metatron made Gadreel
kill Kevin?

92
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,673
It would explain a lot,

93
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:47,876
and there have been
no new prophets,

94
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:50,512
which Metatron could have fixed
to his advantage.

95
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:52,480
And Gadreel said that angels
are returning to heaven?

96
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:53,796
How? I thought that the spell
was irreversible.

97
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:55,251
That's what Crowley said.

98
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:56,918
Look,
let's just find Gadreel

99
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,620
and -- and beat some answers
out of him.

100
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:00,522
Yeah, here's something
to start with that.

101
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:03,058
Uh...Hold on, I'm, uh...

102
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,427
Sending you a photo
of the symbol

103
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:08,430
that drew all the angels in.
Okay.

104
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,368
Got it.

105
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,371
It's acting as some kind
of angel siren.

106
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:17,839
I think it's a spell.

107
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:20,241
The ingredients used
to create it were very odd --

108
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:22,711
Griffin feathers,
bones of a fairy.

109
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:24,279
I've never seen it
before.

110
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,280
Yeah. Me, neither.

111
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:27,215
All right.
Let me see what I can find.

112
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:29,184
"Honor bar."

113
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:32,854
What's honorable about
a miniature bar in a motel room?

114
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:34,823
Everything.

115
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:38,159
How are you, Dean?

116
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,197
I'm fine, Cass.
How about you?

117
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,699
I miss my wings.

118
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:47,435
Life on the road...smells.

119
00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:49,471
Hmm.

120
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:50,839
Yeah.

121
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:52,207
Listen, I got a match,

122
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,609
and it's not from the lore --
it's from police records.

123
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:56,378
Looks like
that symbol you found

124
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,979
was spotted
at a handful of crime scenes

125
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:00,248
the last couple days,
all multiple homicides.

126
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,350
And where were
these crime scenes?

127
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:05,520
Uh, Utah --
Baker, Hill Valley.

128
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:07,656
And I'm
in Bishop's Falls, Utah.

129
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:10,025
Also looks like
most of the crime scenes

130
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:11,326
were in industrial areas.

131
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:13,528
Looks like Gadreel
is heading north.

132
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,063
What's
the next big town?

133
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:17,732
There are two.
It could be Auburn or Ogden.

134
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:20,101
All right, you take Auburn,
we'll take Ogden --

135
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:21,903
meet in the middle.

136
00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:38,186
Didn't we work a case
in Ogden?

137
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:40,789
Yeah. It was a -- it was
a witch situation, right?

138
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,123
Yeah.

139
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,092
There was that kid in town
that helped us, wasn't there?

140
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:46,594
Yes. We should call him,
see if he's still in business.

141
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,129
Yeah.
What was his name?

142
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,445
Good afternoon.

143
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:04,646
It's afternoon?

144
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:07,449
I wonder
if I may procure from you

145
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:09,417
the feathers of a Griffin.

146
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:15,290
Uh  we got
some off-the-menu items,

147
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:17,826
but, uh, this ain't
Diagon Alley, man.

148
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:23,098
I saw the Hunter signs
on the door, young man.

149
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,934
You have what I seek.

150
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:29,838
Griffin feathers,
huh?

151
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,675
Not exactly looking to trip
the light fantastic, are we?

152
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:39,347
Humans never cease
to amaze me.

153
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:41,249
Excuse me?

154
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:43,885
I'm curious --
do you also have fairy bones?

155
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,754
It does not matter
what realm they were from.

156
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:50,925
Griffins and fairies --
the hell you hunting, man?

157
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:53,161
Family.

158
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:55,997
Mm-kay.

159
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:58,199
Let me see
what we have here.

160
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:17,185
<i>Sometimes, you need a break</i>

161
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:19,120
<i>from the hustle and bustle</i>
<i>of city life.</i>

162
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:20,889
<i>#amirite?</i>

163
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:26,761
Sometimes,
you need #casaerotica.

164
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:29,230
Casa erotica.

165
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:31,332
That's inappropriate.

166
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:42,644
Hello.

167
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:44,612
Remember me, bucko?

168
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:46,214
Gabriel.

169
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:50,819
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

170
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:02,597
I need your help,
brother.

171
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,735
I thought you were dead.

172
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:11,870
Please.

173
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,639
You can't take the trick
out of the Trickster.

174
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,375
So, I assume
you faked your own death?

175
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,677
And I assume
you weren't let into Mensa

176
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,712
while I was gone.

177
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:24,415
Where have you been?

178
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:28,987
Ohhh, you know
hither with a side of yon.

179
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:32,857
I was hiding,
captain side eyes,

180
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,495
in the safest place
in the universe -- heaven.

181
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,732
But then you
and the other two stooges

182
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:44,202
had to go and ruin Christmas,
now, didn't you?

183
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,570
Sorry.

184
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,873
Oh, cry me a river.

185
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,376
Look...

186
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,678
I dropped, I hid,

187
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,380
I finally watched
"Downton Abbey."

188
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,382
But then,
your BFF, Metatron,

189
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,918
sent his minions out
looking for me.

190
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,754
Apparently, he thinks
since I'm an archangel

191
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,322
that I have extra juice.

192
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,991
And that you're a threat?

193
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,193
Yeah, but I got hurt
in the fall, too,

194
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,596
used most of my juice
to get back into porn.

195
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,866
That came out wrong.

196
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,801
So did that.

197
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,504
Uh, the point is,
I've been on the run.

198
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:23,274
But then,
a few weeks ago,

199
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,611
somebody started playing
my song.

200
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,112
The angel siren.

201
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,181
No.

202
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,250
The horn of Gabriel --

203
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,686
one of dad's
little party favors

204
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,721
that I never got around
to messing with.

205
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:41,225
Metatron dug it up
and started blowing,

206
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,828
so I came out of hiding.

207
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,531
Why?

208
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,634
There's safety in numbers.

209
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,770
But Metatron was using it
to trap angels,

210
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,372
not unite them.

211
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,740
It wasn't Metatron.

212
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,843
It was his second in command --
Gadreel.

213
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,145
Gadreel?

214
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,214
<i>That</i> old chestnut?
Wow!

215
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,116
What do you want from me?

216
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,319
Your help, Columbo.

217
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,956
I'm getting the band
back together.

218
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,793
We're going
on the kill Metatron tour,

219
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,730
and you're looking
at the new front man.

220
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,038
Sam.

221
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,994
Got an open box
of feathers over here.

222
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,903
Dean.

223
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,877
We got to find Gadreel before
he lights up the bat signal.

224
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,547
This is Dean's other <i>other</i> cell,

225
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,815
so you must know what to do.

226
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,551
Dean, it's me.
I'm --

227
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,585
Ho, whoa, whoa, whoa!

228
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,254
Hands-free much?

229
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,623
Both on the wheel.
I'm precious cargo.

230
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,658
Hey, what's up, shorties?

231
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,462
Remember me,
the guy who died for your sins?

232
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,864
No, not the cat
with the beard and sandals --

233
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,099
the hot one.

234
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,901
Hey, thank you so much

235
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:33,037
for the flowers
and condolences --

236
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,440
really meant a lot to the fam.

237
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:40,011
Any old how, your boy toy and I
are rolling our way

238
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,613
towards your
top-secret domicile.

239
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,549
Ooh!
Call to discuss.

240
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,452
Those kooky kids.

241
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,620
So, you've been back
for months.

242
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,756
What have you seen
out there?

243
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:57,562
After it was
raining winged men, hallelujah?

244
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:01,733
Well, you know --
total nigh-biblical chaos,

245
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:07,371
Crowley and Aba-douche
duking it out.

246
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,373
Good times.

247
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:15,279
And then there's our peeps,
scattered like confetti.

248
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,749
There has been
a lot of confusion.

249
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,218
You think?

250
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,521
Most angels aren't like us,
Castiel.

251
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:28,025
They can't handle
this whole free-will thing.

252
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:32,830
They're sheep, drones.

253
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:37,034
But us?
We're different.

254
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,103
We're rebels --

255
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:44,442
one without a cause,
one with.

256
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,977
I'm just a soldier.

257
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,145
Bitch, please.

258
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:50,248
You've been God
more often than dad has.

259
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,682
Yeah.

260
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:52,850
Look how <i>that</i> worked out.

261
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:57,488
Well, go ahead.

262
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,358
Be a soldier
all you want.

263
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,426
I'm gonna need
as many as I can find.

264
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,961
Why are you doing this,
Gabriel?

265
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,898
I always run...

266
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,468
From dad,
from the family.

267
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,970
I don't
want to run anymore.

268
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:17,108
I want to do
what I was meant to do -- lead.

269
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,314
Well, we need a leader.

270
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,616
And I'm happy
it's gonna be you.

271
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,692
A little low on gas,
aren't we?

272
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,404
Ooh,
smell that cancer.

273
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,841
Delicious!

274
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,146
Uh...

275
00:16:55,148 --> 00:17:00,151
Remember the minions of Metatron
I mentioned?

276
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,105
Cass, it's Sam again.

277
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:58,009
Call us.
We need your help.

278
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,073
Hey, douchebag.

279
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,753
Remember me?

280
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,963
We'll never keep these guys
out of here.

281
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,867
I know.
So...We fight.

282
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,069
No. <i>I</i> fight.

283
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,839
I lied before.

284
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,676
I never watched
"Downton Abbey."

285
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,244
I was just trying
to fit in.

286
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:37,048
Oh, and I do have
some archangel juice left.

287
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,150
I can hold these boneheads off
long enough.

288
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,718
Long enough for what?

289
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,020
For you
to get out of here.

290
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,789
No, I'm not leaving you.

291
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,123
Yes, you are.

292
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,359
Those guys will cut you
to ribbons.

293
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:52,229
But I can stall them long enough
for you to amscray.

294
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,298
And you can take
my place.

295
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,700
What are you talking about?

296
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,436
The angels need a leader,

297
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,504
and it's got to be
somebody like us --

298
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,739
somebody different.

299
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,907
No.

300
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,177
I know you don't want
this burden, Castiel.

301
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,679
Neither do I.

302
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:12,183
What if I fail again?

303
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,651
You won't.

304
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,587
You can't.

305
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,393
Thank you.

306
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,695
Shut up.

307
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,041
Haven't got all day,
hotpants.

308
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,076
Was any of this real?

309
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,846
What the hell
are you talking about?

310
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,014
Cass, go!

311
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,083
So, what --
we both die here?

312
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,519
No.
You're already dead.

313
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:53,858
Well.

314
00:19:58,296 --> 00:19:59,964
What gave it all away?

315
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:03,467
My coat was torn
earlier today.

316
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,668
Ah, crap.

317
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,872
I really hate
continuity errors.

318
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,175
So,
none of this is real,

319
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:14,945
and I'm guessing
I'm no longer in the motel.

320
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,148
Here's the thing --

321
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,584
none of it was real,
but all of it was true.

322
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,454
Whose truth --
yours or Metatron's?

323
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,222
Just hear him out,
would you?

324
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,590
He's just trying to help you.

325
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,726
Really? How?

326
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,865
Sorry -- didn't read
the whole script,

327
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,868
just, uh,
skimmed for my parts.

328
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,075
Well, it's good to see you,
old bean.

329
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,377
Wait.

330
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,813
Are you dead?

331
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,735
What makes a story work?

332
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:22,348
If this is like looking
into a fun-house mirror for me,

333
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,850
I cannot imagine
what it is like for you.

334
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,518
How long have you been working
for Metatron?

335
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,022
I will not talk,
and you cannot make me.

336
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:31,257
Yeah?

337
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:33,359
I have been you,
Sam Winchester.

338
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,995
Your insides reek
of shame and weakness.

339
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:44,670
Sam, Sam, Sam! Sam.
Come here.

340
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:48,440
Tonight, I thought
I'd tell you a little story...

341
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:51,310
Let <i>you</i> decide.

342
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:58,751
That was my plan, anyway.

343
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:08,761
I guess
that's where my story failed.

344
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:11,630
Ah.

345
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,734
Yes.

346
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:22,107
This is "The Curious Incident,"
eh, inspector Gregory?

347
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,109
Who?

348
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:26,412
Inspector Gregory.

349
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:29,181
Sherlock Holmes.

350
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,383
"Silver Blaze"?

351
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:33,719
You have been around

352
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:36,922
since scaly things
crawled out of the muck.

353
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:40,626
Would it have killed you to pick
up a book, watch a movie?

354
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:42,328
Here.

355
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,196
I know
it's a bit of a retcon,

356
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,932
but it's gonna make this whole
conversation a lot easier.

357
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:57,042
I just gave you every book,
movie, and TV show

358
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,978
I have consumed
in the last couple of millennia.

359
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,313
Now do you understand

360
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:05,217
that "the universe is made up
of stories, not atoms"?

361
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:11,957
I understand that that's
a -- a quote by Muriel Rukeyser.

362
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,859
Ah!

363
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:16,362
It can be taught.

364
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:19,498
Here are
a few more lessons.

365
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,301
First rule of writers club --
steal from the best.

366
00:23:22,303 --> 00:23:24,036
Second rule?

367
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:26,905
Every hero
needs a villain.

368
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,942
What are you talking you about?

369
00:23:29,944 --> 00:23:33,545
Hannah and her sisters --

370
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:36,415
I set all that up,

371
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:39,551
told Gadreel,
"slaughter all those

372
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:45,958
"who will not join my army,
but let one live, one...

373
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,393
To tell the tale."

374
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:50,662
Is it true?

375
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:53,732
Can you bring angels
back to heaven?

376
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,369
Sorry. No spoilers.

377
00:23:57,371 --> 00:23:59,838
And you keep missing
the point.

378
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,508
You're supposed
to lead the angels.

379
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,344
I am not a leader,
Metatron.

380
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:08,714
Apparently.

381
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:14,053
So...I did my homework.

382
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,457
"The Winchester Gospels."

383
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:21,193
Pulpy stuff.

384
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:25,798
Gave me an idea, though.

385
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,367
You needed to be taught
a lesson,

386
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:33,572
and nobody teaches lessons
better than good old Gabriel,

387
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:35,741
a.k.a. The Trickster.

388
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:40,979
So...I started typing.

389
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:45,150
And you did all this
to make me a hero?

390
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,426
Ah, that's priceless.

391
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:58,864
Um  no.

392
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:03,769
You are not the hero
in this mess-terpiece.

393
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:06,105
You are the villain.

394
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,876
<i>I'm</i> the hero.

395
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:13,378
He's not gonna crack that fast.

396
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,746
I know.

397
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:16,315
Maybe you could hack him
like you and Crowley hacked me.

398
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:18,417
No, no, no, no. Crowley's
the only one who can do that.

399
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,285
And I'm in no mood
to call that dickbag.

400
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,020
We need Cass.

401
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,322
Any word from him?

402
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:25,124
No.
I tried him again.

403
00:25:25,126 --> 00:25:27,526
He hasn't called,
he hasn't texted.

404
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:30,095
I turned on the GPS
on his phone.

405
00:25:30,097 --> 00:25:32,598
He's still in the same town
where we talked to him last.

406
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,999
What the hell?

407
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:34,933
I don't know.

408
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:36,368
You got to go find him.

409
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,302
Wait, what?

410
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:38,904
You're too close to this,
man.

411
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:40,005
And, what, you're not?

412
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:43,008
We're not at this
five minutes,

413
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,044
you're already going Liam Neeson
on his ass.

414
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,146
I got this.

415
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:06,365
So, he acts tough,
and you show kindness.

416
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,700
Is that how this works?

417
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,372
No.

418
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:16,108
See, I don't care
whether you talk.

419
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,411
You're gonna pay
for what you did to him...

420
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,779
and Kevin.

421
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:24,783
Do you know
why I didn't kill you

422
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:27,586
after I stole your Grace?

423
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:30,622
I like you.

424
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:32,591
Truly.

425
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:37,963
Among all God's
little windup toys,

426
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:41,166
you were the only one
with any spunk.

427
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:44,203
I left you human
because I was hoping

428
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:46,705
you would live
happily ever after,

429
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:49,374
but you screwed that up,
too.

430
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:53,045
And now...

431
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:55,347
Uh, you leave me
no choice.

432
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:57,916
I mean, if you want to
get back on board, fine,

433
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:00,986
but you're gonna have to
follow <i>my</i> script.

434
00:27:00,988 --> 00:27:04,723
Well, based on your assessment,
that doesn't sound like me.

435
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:10,495
Lead the dumb, disenfranchised,
rebellious angels

436
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:12,731
against me, Castiel.

437
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:14,666
They will follow you.

438
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:17,369
And they'll all die,

439
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:23,675
but I'm gonna save a nice,
warm seat up top for you.

440
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:25,210
You will be saved.

441
00:27:25,212 --> 00:27:26,278
No.

442
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,081
Mm.

443
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:32,851
You're gonna make me do
the hard pitch, aren't you?

444
00:27:32,853 --> 00:27:38,090
How's that, um, stolen grace
inside you working out?

445
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:42,394
It's fine.

446
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:44,529
No.

447
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:45,897
It's not.

448
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:48,333
It's burning out.

449
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,002
It's gonna burn <i>you</i> out.

450
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:53,372
But I will give you

451
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:58,977
an endless supply
of rechargeable batteries.

452
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:00,612
Deal?

453
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:06,551
Sorry to interrupt
your writing session, sir,

454
00:28:06,553 --> 00:28:08,186
but something's happened.

455
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:09,421
What's wrong?

456
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:12,557
It's Gadreel.

457
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,363
Word around
the campfire is,

458
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,666
you let the snake
into the garden,

459
00:28:20,668 --> 00:28:23,001
ruined it
for all humanity.

460
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:24,870
I set them free.

461
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:27,039
I loved humanity!

462
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:30,008
Well, you sure got got a funny
way of showing it, asshat.

463
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:32,311
Now, look, you tell me

464
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:35,113
about this "getting
back into heaven" crap

465
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:36,915
and I'll end this quick.

466
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:42,220
Otherwise, you can sit here
and rot in those chains forever.

467
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,222
Up to you.

468
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:47,793
All your talk,
all your bluster --

469
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:49,961
you think
you are invincible.

470
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:53,031
The two of you
against the world, right?

471
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:55,033
Damn straight.

472
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:58,003
You really think
Sam would do anything for you?

473
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:00,072
Oh, I know he would.

474
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:02,407
I have been
in your brother's body, Dean.

475
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:05,877
He would not trade his life
for yours.

476
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,979
Well,
thanks for the rerun, pal.

477
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:10,248
Sam's already told me
all that crap.

478
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,683
Hell, he's told me worse.

479
00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:15,087
He told you that
he has always felt that way,

480
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:17,589
that he thinks you are
just a scared little boy

481
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,391
who's afraid
to be on his own

482
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:22,427
because daddy
never loved him enough?

483
00:29:24,565 --> 00:29:27,833
And he is right,
isn't he?

484
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:33,105
Right to think you are a coward,
a sad, clingy, needy --

485
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:37,309
Keep it up!

486
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:39,378
...pathetic bottom-feeder

487
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,314
who cannot even take care
of himself,

488
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:46,485
who would rather drag everyone
through the mud than be alone,

489
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:49,988
who would let everyone
around him die!

490
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,865
No. Do it.

491
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:02,367
Do it!

492
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:03,935
Kill me!!

493
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:07,439
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

494
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:09,541
That's what that whole speech
was about?

495
00:30:11,511 --> 00:30:14,346
You're not afraid to die,
are you?

496
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:18,784
You're afraid to be left
in these chains forever.

497
00:30:18,786 --> 00:30:25,724
Well, you can sit here and rot,
you son of bitch.

498
00:31:57,226 --> 00:31:58,893
Easy there, tiger.

499
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:00,395
I'm here to trade.

500
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:03,665
You have
something of mine,

501
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:06,401
and I have
something of yours.

502
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:18,546
Bring him here tomorrow,
say...6:00-ish?

503
00:32:18,548 --> 00:32:21,950
If not, Castiel dies.

504
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:25,153
No comebacks this time.

505
00:32:25,155 --> 00:32:27,522
An even trade?

506
00:32:27,524 --> 00:32:31,526
I'm an entity of my word.

507
00:33:01,157 --> 00:33:02,791
Dean?

508
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:05,060
Dean!

509
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:11,066
Dean. Hey!

510
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:14,269
Are -- are you okay?

511
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:15,303
Yeah.

512
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:16,571
Yeah, you got to stop
asking me that.

513
00:33:16,573 --> 00:33:17,806
I've been calling you.

514
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:19,741
I mean, w-why didn't you, uh --
He won't talk.

515
00:33:19,743 --> 00:33:21,476
I figured.

516
00:33:23,245 --> 00:33:26,414
He wanted to die,
and I was gonna kill him.

517
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:27,682
I was.

518
00:33:27,684 --> 00:33:32,454
But then I stopped 'cause I know
we need him to talk.

519
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:33,788
Dean, listen.

520
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,424
Metatron has Cass.

521
00:33:36,426 --> 00:33:39,360
He's offering up a trade.

522
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:42,464
We can't trust Metatron.

523
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:44,165
I-I know that. Obviously.

524
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,768
But look,
this is the first time

525
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,537
we're gonna know for sure
where Metatron is.

526
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,706
Let's take Gadreel
to the meet-up,

527
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:54,509
make the exchange,
and then trap Metatron.

528
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:08,590
He's late.

529
00:34:08,592 --> 00:34:10,091
Or he's not gonna show.

530
00:34:10,093 --> 00:34:11,659
Of course
I'm gonna show.

531
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:13,528
I was just waiting
for you two

532
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,030
to finished setting up
your little trap for me.

533
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:22,403
Uh...

534
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:23,638
Am I hitting my mark?

535
00:34:26,008 --> 00:34:28,243
Well, come on. Let's go.
I'm waiting.

536
00:35:02,546 --> 00:35:05,780
Either of you
bring s'mores?

537
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:09,784
Holy Fire always gives them
a delightful minty aftertaste.

538
00:35:11,353 --> 00:35:13,955
Make a wish, boys.

539
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:20,228
No, thanks!

540
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:33,708
Bye-bye.

541
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:47,989
Well,
a deal is a deal.

542
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:49,490
Why are you doing this?

543
00:35:49,492 --> 00:35:52,227
Because I can.

544
00:35:52,229 --> 00:35:55,863
Because you
and your little brother

545
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:58,333
and your fine,
feathered friend

546
00:35:58,335 --> 00:35:59,400
and all those secrets

547
00:35:59,402 --> 00:36:01,369
you've got locked away
in your bunker

548
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:03,504
can't stop me.

549
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:07,008
But I am gonna enjoy
watching you try.

550
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,745
It's gonna be
a hell of a show.

551
00:36:10,747 --> 00:36:13,514
I'll see you around,
Castiel.

552
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:16,884
Never forget
I gave you a chance.

553
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:33,923
Somebody want to tell me
what the hell's going on here?

554
00:36:33,924 --> 00:36:35,724
Metatron
is trying to play God.

555
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,025
<i>Play</i> God?

556
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:39,194
Cass,
he erased angel warding.

557
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:42,097
He friggin' blew out Holy Fire.
He <i>is</i> God.

558
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,000
He's powering up
with the angel tablet.

559
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,768
How the hell are
we supposed to stop this guy?

560
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,638
All right, so what if there is
a stairway to heaven?

561
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,807
We find it
and get a drop on the guy.

562
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,609
You want to sneak
onto the Death Star,

563
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,610
take out the emperor?

564
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,079
Okay,
,I -- I'm not sure

565
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,681
what a fictional battle station
in space has to do with this,

566
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:03,118
but if taking out the emperor
means taking out Metatron,

567
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,019
I'm on board.

568
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,220
Wait, did you --

569
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,456
did you just understand
a Death Star reference?

570
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,858
Yeah, I think so.

571
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,061
But I don't understand
what that has to do with heaven.

572
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:15,497
It's halfway, I guess.

573
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,433
You sure
you're all right?

574
00:37:18,435 --> 00:37:20,636
Yes.

575
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,104
Are you?

576
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:25,340
There's something different
about you.

577
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:27,943
I'm fine.

578
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:36,451
What have you done?

579
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:37,853
It's a means to an end.

580
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,287
Damn it, Dean.

581
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:44,526
Look, you find heaven,
you drop a dime.

582
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,895
Meantime,
I got a knight to kill.

583
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,333
Be safe out there.

584
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,669
You, too. Hey, Sam.

585
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:57,072
You keep an eye on him.

586
00:38:20,897 --> 00:38:22,197
Is the door secure?

587
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,198
Yes.

588
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,000
The way home is safe.

589
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,103
Thank you, Gadreel.

590
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,372
How did your play
turn out?

591
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:35,210
Didn't quite turn out
as I'd planned,

592
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,447
but that is why we rewrite.

593
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,515
That was God's problem,
you know --

594
00:38:40,517 --> 00:38:43,552
he published
the first draft.

595
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:49,024
You got to keep at it till
you get all your ducks in a row.

596
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:57,299
Was the Winchesters grabbing me
part of your plan?

597
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:01,403
That was a surprise.

598
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:06,108
But, hey, what writer
doesn't love a good twist?

599
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:11,813
My job is to set up
interesting characters

600
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:13,815
and see where they lead me.

601
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:19,121
The by-product of having
well-drawn characters is...

602
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,589
They may surprise you.

603
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,960
But I know something
they don't know --

604
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,728
the ending.

605
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,564
How I get there
doesn't matter

606
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:34,102
as long as everybody plays
their part.

607
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:53,355
? Ooooooooh ?

608
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:59,127
? oooh-oooh-oooh,
oooh, oooh ?

609
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:03,064
? aaaaaaaaah

610
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:09,504
? aaah-aaah-aaah,
aaah, aaah ?

611
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:19,881
? loneliness

612
00:40:19,883 --> 00:40:23,952
? is the coat you wear

613
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:29,558
? a deep shade of blue

614
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,129
? is always there

615
00:40:35,631 --> 00:40:39,801
? the sun ain't gonna shine
anymore ?

616
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:45,507
? the moon ain't gonna rise
in the sky ?

617
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:51,646
? the tears are always clouding
your eyes ?

618
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:58,687
? when you're
without lo-o-o-o-o-o-ve ?

619
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:02,424
? baby

620
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:07,462
? sun ain't gonna shine
anymore ?

621
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:12,100
? the moon ain't gonna rise
in the sky ?

622
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:17,138
? tears are always clouding
your eyes ?

623
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,742
? the sun ain't gonna shine
anymore ?

624
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:31,253
? when you're
without lo-o-o-o-o-ve ?

625
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:34,990
? ooooooooh

626
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:41,630
? oooh-oooh-oooh,
oooh, oooh ?

627
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:47,736
? sun ain't gonna shine
anymore ?

628
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:51,306
? sun ain't gonna shine
anymore ?

629
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:54,843
? not anymore
