1
00:00:01,974 --> 00:00:03,808
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can!

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,910
Now, Dean! Go!

3
00:00:05,912 --> 00:00:06,844
What else do you remember?

4
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:08,412
Nothing.
I was a kid, all right?

5
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:09,447
And most important --

6
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:11,215
Watch out for Sammy.

7
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:13,451
Watching out for you --
it's kinda who I am.

8
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:14,986
I got this brother, right?

9
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:18,055
And he's always telling me how
he's gonna watch out for me.

10
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:19,290
Now eat your dinner.

11
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:21,092
Don't forget your vegetables.

12
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:23,127
Don't you dare think
that there is anything

13
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,096
that I would put
in front of you!

14
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:26,898
Sammy's hurt.
He's hurt real bad.

15
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,766
I heal Sam
while healing myself.

16
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:31,569
Every time I use my power,
it weakens me.

17
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:32,803
You went through the trials.

18
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:34,372
I just think it's better
if you took it easy,

19
00:00:34,374 --> 00:00:36,707
you know,
and didn't act like you were --

20
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:38,175
Possessed by an angel.

21
00:00:45,717 --> 00:00:47,652
Aah!
Wait up!

22
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:51,789
Hurry!
He's right behind us.

23
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:00,398
Come on, come on!

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,999
Hurry!

25
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:07,939
Go, go, go -- it's open!

26
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:26,190
Come on, guys.

27
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:30,494
The barn is a no-fly zone
during hide-and-go-seek.

28
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:32,863
Boys?

29
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:35,366
Come on, you delinquents.

30
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:37,068
Time for bed!

31
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:41,005
All right!
Game is over, boys!

32
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:45,443
Let's bring it in!
Lights out was 10 minutes ago!

33
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:51,482
You little bastards.

34
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:52,984
Okay, I'm gonna...

35
00:01:58,323 --> 00:02:00,191
You got till the count of 10,

36
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:03,094
and you'd better come out
or the belt's coming off!

37
00:02:05,063 --> 00:02:06,263
1...

38
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:11,335
Come on!

39
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:16,807
Boys?

40
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:20,978
Come on!

41
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:24,482
This isn't funny.

Kevin?

46
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:43,894
Hello?

47
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:46,797
I'm sorry, there's no, uh --
there's no Dee-dawg, uh...

48
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,898
I got it.
I got it.

49
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,767
Sonny, hey.
So, what's up?

50
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,238
Okay.

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,074
All right. Yeah, just sit tight.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

52
00:03:57,076 --> 00:03:58,242
Yeah.

53
00:03:59,212 --> 00:04:02,046
So, what was that all about,
Dee-dawg?

54
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:05,049
You remember
when we were kids

55
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:06,684
that spring
in upstate New York?

56
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:08,752
Dad was on a rugaru hunt.

57
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:10,387
We, uh --
we crashed at the, uh...

58
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,690
the bungalow colony
with the ping-pong table.

59
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:15,459
Yeah. Uh, y-you disappeared.
Dad came back. You were gone.

60
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,628
He shipped me off to Bobby's
for a couple months

61
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,662
and went and found you.

62
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:20,397
You were lost on a hunt
or something.

63
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,435
That's what we told you.
Right.

64
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:26,504
I'm sorry.
That's what you told me?

65
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:29,306
Truth is, um...

66
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:32,309
I lost the food money that
dad left for us in a card game.

67
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:33,944
I knew you'd get hungry,

68
00:04:33,946 --> 00:04:35,946
so I tried taking
the five-finger discount

69
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:37,748
at the local market
and got busted.

70
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,752
I wasn't on a hunt.
They sent me to a boys' home.

71
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:44,188
A boys' home,
like a reform school?

72
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,322
Yeah, more or less.

73
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:47,658
It was a farm, and the guy
who ran it -- Sonny --

74
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,593
he, uh --
you know, he looked after me.

75
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:52,229
Wait. Does Sonny know
what we do?

76
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,497
Yeah. He's good people.

77
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:55,799
I gave him the number
to the bat phone,

78
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:58,636
and sounds like he's got
something in our wheelhouse.

79
00:04:58,638 --> 00:05:00,004
So...

80
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:03,474
Hey, you gonna be cool to do
this, or are you too tired?

81
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:06,210
Uh, no. Yeah, I'm just, uh...
I'll be fine.

82
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:11,849
And everybody's okay with
heading out to the Catskills?

83
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,352
I am everybody.

84
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:16,887
Yeah.
Right. All right.

85
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:19,190
Grab your stuff,
and we'll head out.

86
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:21,625
Hey, Dean...

87
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:23,862
I mean, why didn't you

88
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:25,530
just tell me you went
to a boys' home?

89
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:27,998
I don't know.
Uh, it was dad's idea.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,602
And then it just -- you know,
the story became the story.

91
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:32,970
I was 16.

92
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,930
You were here for two months
and dad couldn't find you?

93
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:01,665
Oh, no. He found me.
He found me quick.

94
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,534
But he left me here
'cause I lost our money.

95
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:05,469
You were 16.
You made a mistake.

96
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:06,870
Yeah.
<i>I</i> made the mistake.

97
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:09,340
Look, I know how you think.
None of this was dad's fault.

98
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:19,617
Hi.

99
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:20,784
What can I do
for you boys?

100
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm Dean.
This is my brother, Sam.

101
00:06:22,922 --> 00:06:24,922
We're old buddies
of Sonny's.

102
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:26,790
Prison buddies?

103
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:33,230
No. Uh, you mind telling him
that we're here?

104
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,368
I'll go get him.

105
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:41,639
I just mopped this floor, so you
take off those roach stompers.

106
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,077
Sonny's an ex-con, huh?

107
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,113
What,
and we're such angels?

108
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:52,049
Trust me,
he's more than made up for it.

109
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:04,028
Steven Hewlett
caught him red-handed

110
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,263
- stealing up at his store.
- So, what did he take?

111
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:08,265
Get this --
peanut butter and bread.

112
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,035
Okay.

113
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:12,369
And how about family?

114
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:13,704
Well, his old man called.

115
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:16,573
Once he found out what happened,
he said let him rot in jail.

116
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,876
Judge is off
on a fishing trip.

117
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:20,678
The boy's too young
to leave in county.

118
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,047
So we thought it best
he stay here till arraignment.

119
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:25,182
I don't see why not, man.

120
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:27,951
Appreciate it, Sonny.

121
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:30,454
Where'd you get the shiner?

122
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,423
You think that's funny?
I think you're slow.

123
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:33,857
You sucker punched me!
You wish!

124
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,693
Come on, now!
Billy, I got this, buddy.

125
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:37,227
It's all right.

126
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:45,169
You shouldn't do that,
kid.

127
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:47,104
Yeah? Why?
Because he's a cop?

128
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:51,909
Because when you make him mad,
he leaves with the key.

129
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:02,586
Eh, don't sweat it.

130
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:09,526
Deputy do that?

131
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:12,329
What, your old man?

132
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:14,998
Well, then,
how'd you get it?

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,034
Werewolf.

134
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:21,939
Okay.

135
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:36,920
So, how do you know
I won't just run away?

136
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:38,555
Because you're hungry.

137
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:40,924
No, I'm not.

138
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:44,061
Well, then, why'd you steal
bread and peanut butter?

139
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:50,734
So, what is this place,
anyway?

140
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:53,003
It's for boys like you.

141
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:54,304
You work the land.

142
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:56,774
Teaches you some discipline
and responsibility.

143
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:57,808
Keeps you out of trouble.

144
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,310
That's lame.

145
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:03,380
Beats jail.

146
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:05,816
Come on.
I'll fix you something to eat.

147
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,587
Dee-dawg!

148
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:13,223
Sonny, good to see you.
Hey, you, too, brother.

149
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:15,993
Oh, and this must be Sam.
Good to meet you.

150
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:17,327
Back at you, brother.

151
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:21,398
So, farm looks,
uh, nice.

152
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh, please, man.
It's barely standing.

153
00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:24,731
Only got a handful of kids
working around here now.

154
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:25,603
Why's that?

155
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:27,237
Because these days,
the system

156
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,540
would rather incarcerate a boy
than redeem him.

157
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:33,444
Hey, Sonny, uh, y-you mind
if we talk alone?

158
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:38,382
Hey, Ruth, would you,
uh, please go check on the boys,

159
00:09:38,384 --> 00:09:40,417
make sure their morning chores
are getting done?

160
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:45,923
All right.
So, what's happening?

161
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:48,692
Well, you remember Jack,
don't you?

162
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:50,661
Yeah. The, uh,
tough, old leatherneck.

163
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:51,895
Mm-hmm.

164
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:54,531
Well, somehow, that ancient,
rusty, broken-down tractor

165
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:57,234
just roared to life and
ran him over the other night.

166
00:09:57,236 --> 00:10:00,504
Maybe -- maybe it just,
uh, slipped out of park

167
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:01,905
or something.
Couldn't have.

168
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:04,241
You know, I never --
I never believed

169
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:07,110
any of this mumbo-jumbo stuff
you boys are into,

170
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:08,545
but...
something ain't right.

171
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:10,113
What do you mean?

172
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:12,149
Well, just things
started happening --

173
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:14,251
you know,
lights flickering on and off,

174
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:17,221
strange scratching sounds
coming from inside the walls,

175
00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:18,989
windows and doors slamming.
All right.

176
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:20,924
You think you can round up
the boys while we take a look around?

177
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:22,693
Well, that shouldn't be a problem.
Most are home on break --

178
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:25,062
well, except those
with no home worth going to.

179
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:27,164
Mm.

180
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,333
All right.
Why don't you take the house?

181
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:32,035
I'll check out the barn.

182
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:34,171
Yeah.

183
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,493
Hey. I am so sorry.

184
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:32,496
I-I-I thought I...
saw something in, uh --

185
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:33,964
Like a ghost?

186
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:40,203
Sonny told me
you were old friends,

187
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:43,040
but I know why
you're really here.

188
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:46,510
That's why
I was praying for us.

189
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:48,045
Praying for what?

190
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:54,151
For the ghost that haunts
this farm to leave.

191
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:24,648
All right, Casper...

192
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,583
Where are you at?

193
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:57,414
Hello?

194
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:07,124
Anybody here?

195
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:15,999
Hey, kid, what are you doing
in here by yourself?

196
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,035
Fighting monsters.

197
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:20,570
What kind of monsters?

198
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:24,141
All sorts
with Bruce the monster smasher.

199
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:28,879
Hmm.
Is that a cape?

200
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:32,582
Little impractical
for smashing monsters, huh?

201
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:33,950
You know,
you could choke.

202
00:13:33,952 --> 00:13:36,119
<i>I clobber evil!</i>

203
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:40,257
I bet you do.

204
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:42,092
I'm Dean.

205
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:44,194
Timmy.

206
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:49,900
Let's try that again.

207
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:51,702
If you're gonna be a man,

208
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:53,570
you got to learn how to shake
like one, okay?

209
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:57,240
So give me
your best Kung Fu grip.

210
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:59,142
Good. Now look me
straight in the eye.

211
00:13:59,144 --> 00:14:00,777
Let me know
that you mean business.

212
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,714
Shake as hard as you can.
That's it.

213
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:06,983
You shake like that,
you'll be all right.

214
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:11,321
Hey, Timmy, did you know
Jack who worked here?

215
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:13,423
Mm-hmm.

216
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:15,425
What can you tell me
about him?

217
00:14:15,427 --> 00:14:17,594
He yelled a lot.

218
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:19,896
He was yelling
when he had his accident.

219
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:21,631
How do you know that?

220
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,382
'Cause me and the other boys

221
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:24,936
were playing here
when it happened.

222
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:27,404
Did you see anything?

223
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:31,174
Is there anything else
about that night

224
00:14:31,176 --> 00:14:33,543
that you can remember,
anything at all?

225
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:38,715
It suddenly got
really cold.

226
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:42,119
Can I go?

227
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:44,387
I have to finish my chores
before Ms. Ruth gets mad.

228
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:47,557
That Ruth --
she runs a tight ship, huh?

229
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,226
Yeah, you better roll.

230
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:55,599
I grew up in this town.

231
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:58,702
I used to come up here
as a little girl.

232
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:02,172
The Wasserlaufs,
Howard and Doreen --

233
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:04,274
they used to own this farm
back then.

234
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:09,679
My co-worker, Jack,
may he rest in peace,

235
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:11,648
he worked here
as a farmhand.

236
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,217
Howard was a nice man,
but...

237
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:16,887
Well, he'd get
into that corn liquor.

238
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,789
And one night he got it
into his thick skull

239
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,925
that Jack and his wife, Doreen,
were rolling around in the hay.

240
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,126
It wasn't true, but --

241
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:26,763
but Howard's paranoia
got the better of him.

242
00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:29,666
He tried to kill them both.

243
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:32,469
Jack got away,
but Doreen...

244
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:34,471
He killed her?

245
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:36,973
With a meat cleaver.

246
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:40,076
Got life in jail...

247
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,281
which for Howard
ended a year ago.

248
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:48,585
He always swore he'd get
his revenge on poor, old Jack,

249
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:53,590
and...looks like
he finally got it.

250
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:56,693
Is Howard
buried here in town?

251
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:03,533
So

252
00:16:03,535 --> 00:16:06,236
Dad didn't want you
to tell me.

253
00:16:06,238 --> 00:16:07,304
How come?

254
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:09,206
Was this place
really so bad?

255
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,240
I don't really remember.

256
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:12,409
I mean,
look, nobody bad touched me.

257
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:13,743
Nobody burned me
with their smokes

258
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:15,045
or beat me
with a metal hanger.

259
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:17,347
I call that a win.

260
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:19,115
Hey.

261
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:37,200
All right. Let's
barbecue old MacDonald here,

262
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:40,537
get the hell out
of Dodge.

263
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:27,050
Help! Help!

264
00:17:31,455 --> 00:17:33,857
Ruth, you okay?

265
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,892
What's wrong?

266
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:40,897
Open up!

267
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:43,967
Ruth!

268
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:47,237
? Ave Maria

269
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:52,275
? Ave Maria

270
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,547
That's okay.

271
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:18,285
Dean, you know I'm fine just grabbing
a burger to go somewhere, right?

272
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:21,588
What, and miss out on the best
banana pancakes you ever had?

273
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,291
Thanks.
No problem.

274
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:26,693
I do this for all the boys after they've
been here for a month.

275
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:29,286
I meant for getting
the charges against me dropped.

276
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:30,987
Well, being hungry's
not a crime.

277
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,455
It's the stealing
that is.

278
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:34,257
But I feel
if you only do that once,

279
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:35,992
you don't deserve
a record.

280
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:40,163
And seeing as how we can't find
your pops anywhere,

281
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:42,699
you can stay here
as long as you want, Dean.

282
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:47,103
You're doing good in school.
You're making friends.

283
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:49,873
You made
the wrestling team.

284
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,008
I'm proud of you.

285
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:57,447
Let me ask you something,

286
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:59,916
and I want you to be straight
with me.

287
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:02,419
Are you into
the whole heavy-metal,

288
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:03,720
devil-worshiping stuff?

289
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:05,455
What?

290
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:06,723
No.

291
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:08,558
Hey, I'm not --
I'm not judging.

292
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,494
It's just I found
a few occult-looking symbols

293
00:19:11,496 --> 00:19:12,962
carved into your bedpost.

294
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:15,865
It's...

295
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:17,785
It's a very long story.

296
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,989
That story have anything to do
with why you put the salt

297
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:21,795
in front of your bunk door
every night before bed?

298
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:25,030
Well, it's a family thing,
so I can't really talk about it.

299
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:27,066
Same family
that left you here?

300
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,473
What are you --

301
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:36,709
what are you,
in the mob or something?

302
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,210
More like something.

303
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,552
I was part of this gang,
right?

304
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:48,554
They were my family.

305
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:51,724
I lived, breathed,
I would have even died for them.

306
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,592
You know
where it got me?

307
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:56,028
15 years
in a correctional facility.

308
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,830
And for what?

309
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:00,966
Being loyal?
To who?

310
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:03,302
I should have been loyal
to myself.

311
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:06,071
Because you get one shot
at this game, Dean,

312
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,273
and when you look
in the mirror,

313
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:11,677
you want the guy looking back
at you to be his own man.

314
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,778
Hey, guys.

315
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,113
Hey, Robin.
How are you?

316
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:16,348
I'm good. How are you?
Good.

317
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,317
Meet my new
ranch foreman here, Dean.

318
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,953
Hi. Welcome to Cus's.
What can I get you two?

319
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:24,523
Bet you never thought
you'd see me here, huh?

320
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,193
Uh, look, I'm a little bit
slammed right now.

321
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:30,162
Do you guys want to hear
the specials?

322
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:33,065
Robin...
Dean Winchester.

323
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:36,402
Um...
I used to live up at Sonny's.

324
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:38,037
Oh, oh.

325
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,938
Uh, look, sorry.
There's just --

326
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,274
there's so many boys
that pass through there,

327
00:20:42,276 --> 00:20:44,743
it's -- it's hard to remember
every -- every name and face.

328
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,747
Yeah. Uh, no.
Sorry, I just --

329
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,549
I remember you coming up there
with your mom.

330
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:52,217
She'd give guitar lessons.
It's, uh --

331
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:53,352
it was a long time ago.

332
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:55,821
Yeah. Mom --
she loved helping out the boys.

333
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:58,691
I guess that's why I kept giving
lessons after she passed.

334
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,730
Hey, Robin?

335
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:07,533
Um, would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.

336
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:08,600
Dude...

337
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,002
Let's go.

338
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:11,103
W--

339
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,707
what was that?

340
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:15,908
Nothing.

341
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,243
Nothing? Well, obviously
it was something.

342
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:19,745
Who was that waitress?

343
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:21,146
Said it was nothing, all right?
Drop it.

344
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,481
Sonny.

345
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,683
What?!

346
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:30,689
I tried to get in to save her,
but the damn door wouldn't open.

347
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:31,890
Locked?

348
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:34,760
There's no locks
on the farm.

349
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:39,064
That means our little field trip
to the cemetery was a bust.

350
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,264
Sonny, is there anything else
weird you can remember?

351
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:43,542
What, 'cause we're not chest-deep
in weird already, boys?

352
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:44,304
I know, I know.

353
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:46,405
I mean anything --
really.

354
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:47,906
There was one thing.

355
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:50,876
Ruth always had
her rosary beads with her,

356
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:52,711
but now I can't find them
anywhere.

357
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:55,047
All right. Um, let's start
with the vics, okay?

358
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:56,849
I mean,
both lived in the house.

359
00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:59,184
They both, uh, worked closely
with the boys.

360
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:02,087
All right, why don't I go have a
chat with the rug rats, see what's up?

361
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:03,322
Yeah.

362
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:05,224
Sonny, you got any
employee records on the victims?

363
00:22:05,226 --> 00:22:06,492
In my office.

364
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:08,761
Let's do it.

365
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:10,462
Come on, whatcha gonna do
about it? You gonna cry?

366
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:13,398
Timmy,
you're such a little weirdo.

367
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,967
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey!

368
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:16,568
What are you doing?
Come here. Huh?

369
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,070
Nothing.

370
00:22:18,072 --> 00:22:19,538
Timmy, what's going on?

371
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:23,442
All right, you two.

372
00:22:23,444 --> 00:22:25,677
Where were you this morning
when Ruth had her accident?

373
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,547
Unless you're a cop, we don't
need to tell you anything.

374
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:30,115
Oh, okay.

375
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:34,052
Well...how about <i>that?</i>

376
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,857
We weren't even here
this morning.

377
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,594
Sonny sent us into town to get
some chicken feed -- we swear.

378
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:45,564
What about Ruth?
What can you tell me about her?

379
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:48,033
Uh, we used to call her
the warden.

380
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,935
She was a real
Bible-thumping hard-ass.

381
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:52,104
Obviously. What else?

382
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:55,107
Anything different or weird
you can think of?

383
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,142
You mean besides Timmy?

384
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:58,744
Hey.

385
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:02,781
Either of you touch him
ever again,

386
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:04,616
I'm gonna go all Guant?namo
on you.

387
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,385
Understand me?

388
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:08,287
Get the hell out of here.

389
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:10,622
Go on! Get.

390
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,228
Hey.

391
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,763
You and Bruce okay?

392
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:19,598
Yeah.

393
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,233
Listen to me.

394
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:23,702
Guys like that --
they're cowards, okay?

395
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:26,505
All you got to do is stand up
to them one time

396
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:28,607
and they'll stop,
I promise.

397
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:31,910
Okay.

398
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,947
Sonny, wait.

399
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:39,284
Um...
W-what is all this?

400
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:41,787
It's our hall of fame.

401
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:44,223
We had some pretty great
athletes come through here,

402
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:46,124
including your brother.

403
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:51,196
He was Sullivan county
135-pound wrestling champion.

404
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:13,185
Hey, guys!

405
00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:16,488
She could give me a lesson
anytime.

406
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,457
Gross.
She's like ancient.

407
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,367
What the hell?

408
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:41,079
What's this doing
in here?

409
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:30,323
Kid's gonna need about 8,000
stitches, but he'll be fine.

410
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:34,194
That kid was bullying Timmy
before the accident, right?

411
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:36,863
Yeah. Why?

412
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:38,165
Check this out.

413
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,766
Timmy was found
in an abandoned building

414
00:25:39,768 --> 00:25:41,768
about a year ago
all by himself.

415
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,603
No one was sure how long
he had been there.

416
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:44,771
And what
about his parents?

417
00:25:44,773 --> 00:25:46,473
Well, they posted a picture
on the Internet,

418
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:47,407
but no one ever showed up.

419
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:49,176
Well, then,
what's he doing here?

420
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:50,911
Shouldn't he be
in an orphanage?

421
00:25:50,913 --> 00:25:52,713
He kept running away
from Child Services.

422
00:25:52,715 --> 00:25:54,916
So about three months ago,
Sonny offered to take him in.

423
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:56,283
All right,
so hard-ass counselors,

424
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:58,351
bullies all bite the dust,
but Timmy's still standing.

425
00:25:58,353 --> 00:25:59,720
So, what are we talking?

426
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:01,621
We got ourselves a Damien
on our hands?

427
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:03,023
No.
EMF rules out a demon.

428
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:05,759
So...
probably ghost possession.

429
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:08,428
Meaning what, we find Timmy
and shove a fistful of salt

430
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,430
down his throat,
forced ejection?

431
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:14,835
You're taking the barn
this time.

432
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,005
So, you've been
a lot of places?

433
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:01,208
Yeah. My, uh...

434
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,343
My dad likes
to move around a lot.

435
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:05,445
What's your dad do?

436
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,983
Boring stuff.

437
00:28:09,985 --> 00:28:11,585
Do you like it?

438
00:28:12,954 --> 00:28:15,522
No, not really.

439
00:28:15,524 --> 00:28:18,792
But my dad expects me
to follow in his footsteps.

440
00:28:18,794 --> 00:28:21,695
So I've kind of
gotten used to it.

441
00:28:21,697 --> 00:28:22,996
Yeah. I-I get it.

442
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:24,865
My pops wants me to
take over the diner,

443
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:27,701
but that's
not happening.

444
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:31,104
So, what do you
really want to do?

445
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,309
I want to be a photographer
and see the world,

446
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:40,580
go to strange lands,
eat crazy food.

447
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:46,553
I want to be a rock star,
but...

448
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:48,488
I also really like cars.

449
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,724
Being a mechanic
seems rough.

450
00:28:50,726 --> 00:28:52,492
What?

451
00:28:52,494 --> 00:28:54,794
No, no. Not at all.

452
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:56,596
Cars are
freaking cool as hell.

453
00:28:56,598 --> 00:28:59,733
Fixing them
is like a puzzle,

454
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:04,404
and the best part is
when you're done, they leave,

455
00:29:04,406 --> 00:29:08,708
and you're not responsible
for them anymore.

456
00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:17,183
Have you kissed
many girls?

457
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:20,153
What?

458
00:29:20,155 --> 00:29:22,689
Yeah. Of course.

459
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:23,723
Lots.

460
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,428
Really?

461
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,865
Well, I guess we'll
just have to keep practicing.

462
00:29:42,276 --> 00:29:43,376
Oh. Hey.

463
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:45,779
Uh, what happened to you
at the diner?

464
00:29:45,781 --> 00:29:48,715
I turned around to take your
order, and you were just gone.

465
00:29:48,717 --> 00:29:51,851
Long story.
Um, have you seen Timmy?

466
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:54,654
No, not yet, but he should be here
any minute for his guitar lesson.

467
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:57,958
Yeah, we're gonna cancel that.
What?

468
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,026
We got to get out of here, okay?
I don't have time to explain.

469
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:03,129
You just got to trust me.
T-trust you?

470
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,637
And why
would I do that again?

471
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:13,239
You <i>do</i> remember me.

472
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:14,908
How could I forget?

473
00:30:16,744 --> 00:30:18,411
? I do recall

474
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:24,050
? those were the best times,
most of all ?

475
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:26,653
? In the heat
with a blue-Jean girl ?

476
00:30:26,655 --> 00:30:28,955
What's wrong?

477
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:31,024
? Burnin' love comes
once in a lifetime ?

478
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:33,159
I just hope this lasts.

479
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:35,028
I'm not going anywhere,
Robin.

480
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,364
Yeah, says you.

481
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:39,699
Well, I can't.

482
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:41,634
? Those summer nights
are callin' ?

483
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:44,237
Who else would take you
to the school dance?

484
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,872
? Stone in love

485
00:30:45,874 --> 00:30:47,741
Is this your way of asking me
to be your date,

486
00:30:47,743 --> 00:30:49,876
Dean Winchester?
Yeah.

487
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:51,644
How am I doing so far?

488
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:56,483
? Stone in love

489
00:30:56,485 --> 00:30:58,151
There were -- there were reasons
why I had to leave.

490
00:30:58,153 --> 00:30:59,853
I don't have time to explain
them to you right now.

491
00:30:59,855 --> 00:31:01,921
I got to get you out
of here.

492
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:03,757
Hey!

493
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,258
What are you doing?!

494
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,060
I'm sorry.

495
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:10,063
Sorry about what,
Timmy?

496
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:13,566
I can't stop it.

497
00:31:14,268 --> 00:31:16,870
Go, go, go!

498
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:23,910
Sam, go!

499
00:31:23,912 --> 00:31:25,311
Locked.

500
00:31:25,313 --> 00:31:27,080
Damn it!

501
00:31:30,117 --> 00:31:31,284
Circle.

502
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:35,522
Dean, what --
what just happened in there?

503
00:31:35,524 --> 00:31:36,723
Okay, listen to me.

504
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:39,559
Whatever happens,
you stay inside this circle.

505
00:31:39,561 --> 00:31:41,227
Understood?

506
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:43,763
All right. Dean...

507
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:48,368
I can't control her.

508
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,470
Can't control who?

509
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:54,007
Your mom, right?

510
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:57,777
Timmy, listen.

511
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,781
We need you to tell us
about the fire, okay?

512
00:32:05,786 --> 00:32:08,421
It was late,
and we were driving home

513
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:10,590
when we crashed in the woods.

514
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:13,159
Everything was on fire.

515
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:16,296
But she saved me,

516
00:32:16,298 --> 00:32:20,467
pushed me out...

517
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:23,570
Before the car blew up...

518
00:32:23,572 --> 00:32:26,773
With her in it.

519
00:32:26,775 --> 00:32:29,642
But that's not all,
was it?

520
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:31,377
I ran through the woods.

521
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:34,214
I found an empty building,
where I hid.

522
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:35,915
I was scared.

523
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:40,053
It was dark and cold.
So I cried.

524
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:41,921
I cried for my mom.

525
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:45,758
And then she came.

526
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,428
But she had changed,
right?

527
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:58,104
I'll bet she gave you
that cool action figure, huh?

528
00:32:58,106 --> 00:33:00,740
Yeah. When I turned 9.

529
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,444
Timmy...

530
00:33:05,346 --> 00:33:07,247
...I'm gonna need
that action figure.

531
00:33:14,256 --> 00:33:15,955
No!

532
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:24,764
<i>I clobber evil!</i>

533
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:27,267
<i>I clobber  evil!</i>

534
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:30,270
<i>I clobber evil!</i>

535
00:33:30,272 --> 00:33:35,275
<i>I...clobber...evil!</i>

536
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:44,083
It looks like it wasn't the action figure
that was anchoring her here, Dean.

537
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:45,485
Well, then, what is?!

538
00:33:51,158 --> 00:33:52,225
Him.

539
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,309
You know what?

540
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:06,488
I think maybe
his mom can't let go

541
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:07,914
and she's still protecting him
from the grave.

542
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:10,015
Protecting him from what?
What, from us?

543
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:11,784
Maybe she doesn't know what
threats are real and what's not,

544
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:13,252
so she just attacks
all of them.

545
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:15,988
Great. So, what, unless we waste
the kid, we're sitting ducks?

546
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:19,024
This is -- this is crazy.

547
00:34:19,026 --> 00:34:21,060
Robin. Robin!

548
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:22,495
Damn it.

549
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,431
Robin, wait!

550
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,932
Who are you?

551
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:29,869
Right now I'm the only thing
that's keeping you safe.

552
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:44,250
Timmy, we're gonna need
your help, okay?

553
00:34:47,621 --> 00:34:51,891
Listen to me.
I need you to focus, okay?

554
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:54,326
Look, we are not here
to hurt you.

555
00:34:57,265 --> 00:34:59,365
Sammy!

556
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:07,673
I can't stop her.

557
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:10,709
Timmy, you have to try!

558
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:14,013
She came to you
when you cried out for her.

559
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:16,949
Now you have to tell her
to stop and go away!

560
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:18,984
She's my mom.
She's a ghost.

561
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:23,055
Timmy, because she can't
move on, she's going crazy.

562
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:26,659
Okay? You got to let her go.
You'll be okay.

563
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:29,862
Listen to me.

564
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:33,265
Sometimes you got to do
what's best for you,

565
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:35,267
even if it's gonna hurt
the ones you love.

566
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:47,012
Mommy...

567
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:48,447
Stop it.

568
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:52,184
Timmy, Kung Fu grip!

569
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:56,689
Mommy, stop it!
Stop hurting people!

570
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:12,304
You have to go.
Never come back.

571
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:17,810
I'll be okay.
I promise.

572
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:48,240
I love you, too.

573
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:16,392
So, then,
this is the family business?

574
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:18,628
Told you it was boring.

575
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,764
Yeah, right.

576
00:37:20,766 --> 00:37:22,298
Well, as you can see,

577
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,367
I did not run off
to become a rock star.

578
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,203
Mm...
I don't know about that.

579
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:29,839
You look pretty rockin' to me,
Dean Winchester.

580
00:37:31,676 --> 00:37:32,942
And what about you?

581
00:37:32,944 --> 00:37:34,944
I mean, I always thought
that I would hate

582
00:37:34,946 --> 00:37:36,980
being in the same little town
my whole life,

583
00:37:36,982 --> 00:37:39,182
and, you know, taking over
the diner

584
00:37:39,184 --> 00:37:41,351
like dad always wanted,
but...I don't.

585
00:37:41,353 --> 00:37:43,720
I just -- I love it.

586
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:46,756
I guess we didn't know
everything we thought we did

587
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:48,391
at 16, huh?

588
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:50,059
Not everything.

589
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:52,495
Just some things.

590
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:13,483
Sounds like Timmy's
gonna need some help adjusting.

591
00:38:13,485 --> 00:38:14,984
Yeah,
but he's got you.

592
00:38:14,986 --> 00:38:18,788
I always hate to see you go,
Dee-dawg.

593
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,624
Can't thank you enough
for this one, man.

594
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,761
Sonny,
we'll see you around.

595
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,330
You can bet on that,
boys.

596
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:29,833
Take it easy, man.

597
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,773
Hey, h-how did you know

598
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:39,542
Timmy asking his mom to leave
was gonna work?

599
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:42,846
I didn't. Total hail Mary.
Got lucky.

600
00:38:42,848 --> 00:38:44,848
You just got lucky?

601
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,852
Kind of like you did
with this place.

602
00:38:48,854 --> 00:38:50,453
I mean,
here I was thinking

603
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,555
this was the worst part
of your life,

604
00:38:52,557 --> 00:38:55,792
and it turns out
it was the best.

605
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:57,560
Why'd you ever leave?

606
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:00,730
Never felt right.

607
00:39:00,732 --> 00:39:02,532
Really?

608
00:39:02,534 --> 00:39:04,734
It was two months, Sam,
okay,

609
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:06,636
and I couldn't wait
to get out of here.

610
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,905
I don't know what to tell you.
It wasn't me.

611
00:39:30,928 --> 00:39:34,063
Oh, look at you.

612
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:36,866
You clean up good!
Thank you.

613
00:39:36,868 --> 00:39:39,035
You know, uh...
I've never actually been

614
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:41,738
to one of these school dances
before.

615
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,008
Yeah.

616
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,877
Look, about that, Dean,
your old man's outside,

617
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:52,482
and, man,
he's really something.

618
00:39:52,484 --> 00:39:55,351
I tried to tell him what a big
night it was for you, Dean,

619
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:57,053
and ask him if he
could come back later,

620
00:39:57,055 --> 00:39:58,721
but he just said to tell you
he had a job,

621
00:39:58,723 --> 00:40:02,425
said you'd know
what that means.

622
00:40:12,736 --> 00:40:15,038
You know,
after I got out of jail,

623
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,774
this place gave me
a second chance,

624
00:40:17,776 --> 00:40:21,811
and it's done the same
for you, too.

625
00:40:21,813 --> 00:40:25,014
So if you want,
I'll stick my neck out for you,

626
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:26,950
and I'll fight
for you to stay.

627
00:40:58,483 --> 00:41:00,817
Sonny...

628
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:07,156
...thank you --
for everything.

629
00:41:07,158 --> 00:41:09,892
But I have to go.

630
00:41:22,373 --> 00:41:24,307
Dean...

631
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:27,243
Thank you.

632
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:28,978
For what?

633
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,149
For always being there,
for having my back.

634
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:38,021
Look, I know
it always hasn't been easy.

635
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:42,792
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.
