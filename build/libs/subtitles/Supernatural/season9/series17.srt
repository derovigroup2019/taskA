1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,280
Henry Winchester.

2
00:00:05,282 --> 00:00:06,999
My father
and his father before him

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:08,050
were both Men of Letters.

4
00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:09,951
If you guys
were such a big deal,

5
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:11,003
then why haven't we
ever heard of you?

6
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:12,621
Josie.

7
00:00:12,723 --> 00:00:15,524
No one told me this initiation
was a formal affair.

8
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:17,743
The hard part's over, right?
We made it.

9
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:19,578
What do you know about the
Men of Letters massacre of 1958?

10
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,914
My name is Abaddon.

11
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,399
We will march into Hell,

12
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:27,285
and demonkind will rise up
and sweep over the earth.

13
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:28,370
Who put Crowley in charge?

14
00:00:28,372 --> 00:00:29,321
The King's dead.

15
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:30,589
Long live the queen.

16
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:33,291
You knew about the mark.
You knew about Abaddon and Cain.

17
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:34,559
You knew all of it.

18
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,910
And you played me.

19
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:38,347
You owe me!

20
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:40,081
You make me a junkie.

21
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,800
You keep me stashed away
for months

22
00:00:41,802 --> 00:00:43,185
while my kingdom falls apart?!

23
00:00:43,187 --> 00:00:44,419
So, where is the Blade?

24
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:46,555
This is the object
of your quest.

25
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:48,306
Dean!

26
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:50,559
Drop the Blade.

27
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:53,729
I'll hang on
to old donkey teeth here

28
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:56,565
until such time
as you locate Abaddon.

29
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,709
<i>I'll tell you, one of</i>
<i>the things that I really love</i>

30
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:09,995
<i>about the Tour Angle 144 --</i>

31
00:01:09,997 --> 00:01:11,747
<i>there are a lot of you</i>
<i>out there</i>

32
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:13,799
<i>that have something</i>
<i>called the chipping yips.</i>

33
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,218
<i>Um, you're not proud</i>
<i>of having them.</i>

34
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,387
<i>A lot of people don't even</i>
<i>want to talk about it.</i>

35
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:19,788
<i>If you don't have them,</i>
<i>be glad.</i>

36
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,792
<i>But I got to tell you,</i>
<i>this product...</i>

37
00:01:23,794 --> 00:01:25,627
What's
on the menu tonight?

38
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:27,062
Meatloaf.

39
00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:28,730
Really? Again?

40
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:30,816
<i>And you're gonna make little</i>
<i>motions back and through...</i>

41
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:32,067
<i>...just brushing the grass.</i>

42
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:34,736
I wish
you wouldn't say that.

43
00:01:34,738 --> 00:01:37,989
You know how hard I work all
day, and yet you criticize me.

44
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:49,150
So, yes.
We're having meatloaf.

45
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:51,286
With potatoes...

46
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:52,871
and broccoli...

47
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:55,457
...and lots
of good things.

00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,715
Hey.

51
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,132
Hey.

52
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,483
You catch any shut-eye
last night?

53
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:17,552
Nope.

54
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,571
Guess I'm driving, then.

55
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,322
Driving where?

56
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:24,409
Caught wind
of a case online.

57
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,578
A 1st-grade teacher came home
and killed her husband.

58
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,613
Well,
maybe she snapped.

59
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,115
Ankle biters
can do that to you.

60
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,268
Dude, she pounded him,
into ground chuck.

61
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,004
So,
what are you thinking?

62
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:38,256
Best guess --
possession.

63
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:41,926
Why don't you go?

64
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:45,713
Dean, look.

65
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,132
I want to find Abaddon,
too,

66
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,917
but we've been combing
through this stuff for days.

67
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,102
Well,
maybe we missed something.

68
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,255
And maybe there are better ways
to spend our time

69
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,640
than just spin our --

70
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,091
Maybe we don't <i>have</i> time.

71
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,310
What's up with you?

72
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,029
Nothing.

73
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,063
Yeah?

74
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:05,900
See, because ever since
you killed Magnus,

75
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:09,770
you've been acting...
sort of...obsessed.

76
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:16,461
Well, maybe because I want
an end to all this.

77
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:19,547
Maybe because
if we find Abaddon,

78
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,466
then Crowley ponies up
the First Blade,

79
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,751
and we kill her
and him both.

80
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:25,720
So, what you call
being "obsessed,"

81
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:28,306
I call doing my job.

82
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:33,428
Okay, um...

83
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,081
I get it, Dean.
I'm just checking in.

84
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,733
I'm fine.

85
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,735
All right.

86
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:43,938
Hit me up
if you find anything.

87
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:15,836
It says here
in your report

88
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,472
that you were the first on the scene?
Yes, sir.

89
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:20,024
I found Mrs. Young sitting next
to her husband covered in his blood.

90
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,842
Now,
was her husband abusive?

91
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,478
Ric?
Oh, no. Not at all.

92
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,447
I mean, he could be a stubborn
S.O.B., but can't we all?

93
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,482
Ah.

94
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,484
Anything else, uh, weird

95
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:31,369
that maybe you felt
was too odd to include?

96
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,570
Like?

97
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,372
Like,
did you smell sulfur?

98
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,157
Why would I smell sulfur?

99
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,909
Of course. Uh, thank you.

100
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:41,713
What about Karen's eyes?
You notice anything strange?

101
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,882
Actually, agent, they, uh,
pretty much looked like eyes.

102
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,884
Oh, lord.

103
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:08,906
I don't get this.

104
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,108
Karen and Ric were

105
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,360
two of the most ordinary people
you'd ever meet.

106
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:16,331
Did she go anywhere
on the day of the murder?

107
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,915
It was Saturday.

108
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,400
Uh...

109
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,052
A quick trip
to the grocery store.

110
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,236
That's about it.

111
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:41,305
How's Mrs. Manson doing?

112
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,306
Dead.

113
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,975
Hung herself in her cell.

114
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,060
Lovely.

115
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:47,311
The demon smoke out?

116
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,429
If it was a demon.

117
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,198
I mean, there was no sulfur,
no EMF anywhere.

118
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,232
And everyone who saw her

119
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:52,950
just before
she gutted her husband

120
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,118
said she was totally fine.

121
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,320
What are
you still doing there?

122
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,988
This sounds like
a case of the crazies to me.

123
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,956
Well, if nothing kicks up
by morning, I'm out of here.

124
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,792
How's the research going?

125
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,912
It's going.

126
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:08,216
All right. Well, uh...

127
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:09,300
Good luck.

128
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:22,513
<i>I can give you the Mark, Dean,</i>
<i>if it's what you truly want.</i>

129
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,516
<i>Can I use it</i>
<i>to kill that bitch?</i>

130
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,500
<i>Yes.</i>

131
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,984
<i>But you have to know with</i>
<i>the Mark comes a great burden.</i>

132
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:03,271
Uh-huh.

133
00:07:03,273 --> 00:07:05,440
Yep.

134
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:07,608
No. I know. I'm sorry.

135
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,776
No, I'll make it up to you.

136
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:10,194
Look,
I'm trying to get there, babe,

137
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,679
but I got into a fight
with my mom.

138
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,398
Oh,
I think I got a bite.

139
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,867
Yeah, a van is pulling up.
Let me roll.

140
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,618
I love you. Bye.

141
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:20,705
Oh, hey!

142
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,707
I didn't know this was
your ride, Mr. Richie.

143
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,543
Let's get you
out of the cold.

144
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:28,162
Thanks.

145
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:32,667
It's freezing out there.

146
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,419
Hey,
what -- what are you doing?!

147
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,755
Get off me! No!

148
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:52,056
Order up.

149
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,260
Here you go.
Thanks, R.J.

150
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,480
Can I get you anything else,
honey?

151
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:01,015
Uh, this is great.
Thank you.

152
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:03,017
Order up.

153
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,056
Be with you in a minute,
Bill.

154
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:14,495
Billy, what are you doing?
Your mother raise you in a barn?

155
00:08:14,497 --> 00:08:17,164
Don't talk to me
like that!

156
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,985
Hey.
Take it easy.

157
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:22,235
She's working hard.

158
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:25,522
What's eating <i>you?</i>

159
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:31,378
You. My mom.

160
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,379
Him.

161
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:35,749
Buddy...Give it a rest.

162
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:37,968
Billy?

163
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,970
Billy.

164
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:41,939
I'm gonna call your mom,
have her come fetch you.

165
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:44,558
No, you're not.

166
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:09,883
So, tell me
what's happening here.

167
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:11,468
I was hoping you'd tell me.

168
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,886
You're the one
that mentioned weird.

169
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:14,421
Now, where did
they all come from?

170
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:15,506
Oh, they're all locals.

171
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:18,125
Four of the straightest arrows
you'd ever meet.

172
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:20,627
Apparently, they've been
acting like this for days.

173
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,780
Do they share anything
in common?

174
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:24,798
Church? School?
Uh, book club?

175
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,317
Not of my knowledge.

176
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:28,769
Oh,
I met the kid's girlfriend.

177
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:30,904
She said he was hitching a ride
when a van picked him up,

178
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:32,639
and that's the last
she heard of him.

179
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:36,076
Whatever that's worth.

180
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:57,715
What are you, Billy?

181
00:09:57,717 --> 00:09:59,883
Clear.

182
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:02,519
Of?

183
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:04,805
Everything.

184
00:10:07,693 --> 00:10:08,726
Why are you doing this?

185
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:10,811
You think there's a "why"?

186
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:11,845
No.

187
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:13,831
It's because I want to.

188
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,116
And I can.

189
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:23,824
Grocery store
surveillance pics.

190
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:25,692
Great. Thank you.

191
00:10:34,804 --> 00:10:36,136
Hey.

192
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:38,422
Well, that took forever.

193
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:40,924
Uh, well, I'm working.

194
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:42,976
You got anything?

195
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:44,228
Not sure.

196
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,513
But, um,
a handful of other people

197
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,565
have started acting out,
too.

198
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:50,234
Acting out how?

199
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:54,104
Well, same as the woman --
aggressive, violent, impulsive.

200
00:10:54,106 --> 00:10:55,939
Sounds like
you're in a Gold's gym.

201
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:57,057
Yeah.

202
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,575
Except it's less
steroid-induced,

203
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:00,694
and more...basic instinct.

204
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:04,281
It's like the littlest things
can set them off.

205
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:06,667
Kind of like me.

206
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:08,535
<i>You've got no instinct.</i>

207
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,721
<i>I mean, you are</i>
<i>seriously messed up.</i>

208
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:14,541
You?

209
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:16,343
Yeah, uh, soulless me.
Remember that?

210
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:17,928
Yeah,
how could I forget?

211
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,048
But you weren't out of control
like these people.

212
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,801
Yeah, well, maybe everyone
has a different reaction

213
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:24,935
to losing their soul.

214
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:25,936
Possible.

215
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:27,354
So, what?

216
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:30,274
A crossroads demon making deals
and taking people's souls?

217
00:11:30,276 --> 00:11:31,642
No, I don't think so.

218
00:11:31,644 --> 00:11:33,844
I mean, it's not as if these
people are winning the lotto.

219
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:35,979
Okay.

220
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:37,865
Uh, well,
that was my best swing.

221
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:38,932
I hope not, Dean.

222
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:41,485
I-I could really use
your help down here.

223
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,288
Dean?

224
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,706
Yeah, no, I --

225
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,542
I heard you.
I just, uh...

226
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:52,212
I'm getting close, Sam.

227
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:55,332
I can't drop the ball on Abaddon
right now.

228
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:57,918
All right. Be safe.

229
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:04,241
You're lying to Sam
like he's your wife,

230
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:08,929
which kind of makes me
your mistress.

231
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:19,990
Now,
listen to me, young man.

232
00:12:19,992 --> 00:12:21,808
Those demons are back.

233
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,161
I'm telling you,
it's happening all over again.

234
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:25,128
Demons?

235
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,030
Yes! Demons.
Are you deaf?

236
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:28,815
Yes, ma'am.
You know what?

237
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:30,951
We're gonna take care
of those demons right away.

238
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,670
Now, do you need a ride home
or something?

239
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:35,622
Don't patronize me,
you little turd.

240
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:39,243
Hey, you know what? I can take
it from here. Um, agent Leiter.

241
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:44,848
Please.

242
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,335
Here you are.
Thank you.

243
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:49,520
Sure.

244
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:51,388
Now, why don't you, uh,

245
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,957
tell me all about these demons,
Ms. Wilkinson?

246
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,393
Please, call me Julia.

247
00:12:56,395 --> 00:12:58,278
It's very simple, Agent.

248
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,512
They...

249
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:02,682
...they came to Milton.

250
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:05,819
And?

251
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,873
I say "demons,"
and you don't bat an eye,

252
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,743
when everyone else around here
thinks I'm nuts on toast.

253
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:17,915
Maybe I'm just a bit more, uh,
open-minded than most.

254
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:20,217
Maybe.

255
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:24,838
You're one of them,
aren't you?

256
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,691
Sorry. One of who?

257
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:28,959
Men of Letters.

258
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:31,812
They came here in 1958.

259
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:37,150
Men of Letters...
came <i>here?</i>

260
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:39,570
Oh, yes.
It was different then.

261
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:42,155
I was different.

262
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:47,444
They were
a lovely couple.

263
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:54,901
Sister Julia,
please answer the door.

264
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:57,404
Yes, Mother Superior.

265
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:09,349
Good evening, sister.

266
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:12,936
We're here from
the Office of the Inquisition.

267
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:31,201
What do you want?

268
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,404
You tell me, romeo.
You rang.

269
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,808
Let me guess --
you butt-dialed me?

270
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,277
Whatever the hell
that is.

271
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,146
Either way,
we done here?

272
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,483
Actually, long as I'm here,
last time we chitchatted,

273
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,686
we agreed that you were gonna
line up Carrot Top.

274
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,557
Yep, well...I'm on it.

275
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,295
Unless Abaddon likes
10-cent wings, stale beer,

276
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,264
and the clap,
I doubt that she's here.

277
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:06,737
Go to hell.

278
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,206
Oh, if only.

279
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,874
What's going on with you,
huh?

280
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,309
You call me,
you hang up.

281
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,545
You want Abaddon,
you don't want Abaddon.

282
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,313
You want the Blade,
you don't want the Blade.

283
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,556
If I didn't know you any better,
I'd say you're stalling.

284
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:29,092
Just between us girls,
how did you feel

285
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,596
when you sunk the First Blade
into Magnus' head?

286
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:36,900
Not half as good as I'm gonna
feel when it's yours.

287
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,672
Love it
when you talk dirty.

288
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,008
You know what I think?

289
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,311
I think
you felt powerful...

290
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,379
Virile...

291
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,949
And afraid.

292
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,983
Afraid?

293
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,485
Don't scam a scam artist,
darling.

294
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,121
You're stalling
'cause you're scared.

295
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:03,260
They gave false names,

296
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,330
but later I learned
that the man's name was Henry.

297
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,497
Henry Winchester?

298
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,900
Never got a last name.

299
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,402
Okay, um, and the woman?

300
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,737
Josie.

301
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:17,074
Did you know them?

302
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,076
Yes, uh...

303
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,177
Sort of.

304
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,979
It's complicated.

305
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,780
I'm an ex-nun, sweetie.

306
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,983
Complicated
my middle name.

307
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,388
Now, w-what were they here
to investigate?

308
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,925
Sister Mary Catherine.

309
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,462
She killed two people before
jumping from the bell tower.

310
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,031
So I took 'em to see

311
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,868
Mother Superior
and sister Agnes.

312
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:04,221
Time is of the essence,
Mother...Superior.

313
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,223
The cardinal is meeting
with the holy father

314
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,725
first thing in the morning,
and he wants a report.

315
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:28,378
Our beloved abbey
is open to you, Father.

316
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,115
Sister Julia here
will be your guide.

317
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:43,260
Where would
you like to begin?

318
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,129
Sister Mary Catherine's
sleeping quarters, please.

319
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,334
Sister Mary Catherine's room
it is.

320
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,311
I hate nuns.

321
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,180
Why, because she answered me
and not you?

322
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,981
No, because I went
to Catholic school

323
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,450
and I have
a lot of pent-up anger.

324
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,778
We have no time
for such pettiness.

325
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:10,686
What's got your boxers
all in a bundle?

326
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:11,556
This.

327
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,023
Why are
we out in the field?

328
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,758
It's called
learning on the job.

329
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,992
And you know damn well

330
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,295
this is the last assignment
before we are full members.

331
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,097
Therein lies
the problem.

332
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,365
As our initiation grows closer,
I...

333
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:26,536
I worry that this might be
a selfish endeavor on my part.

334
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,971
Selfish. How?

335
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:32,743
If anything were to happen
to me, what of John? Millie?

336
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,978
They'd be proud to know
that you answered the call.

337
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,314
No. My wife would be a widow,
and my son fatherless.

338
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,849
I don't expect you
to understand.

339
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,218
You don't have a fam--

340
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:45,822
I'm sorry, Josie.
I didn't mean it that way.

341
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,458
I know, Henry.

342
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,293
You're a good man.
Millie is lucky to have you.

343
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,696
Here we are.

344
00:18:57,735 --> 00:19:02,439
The...blood
wouldn't come off.

345
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:09,980
So, we're assuming demonic
possession here, correct?

346
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,315
Or a linguist gone mad.

347
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,255
It looks ancient.

348
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,091
Zapoqra or Sanskrit?

349
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,360
No.
It -- it's pre-Enochian.

350
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,062
A crest of some sort.

351
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,498
Kni--

352
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,634
"Knights of Hell"?

353
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,738
What is that?

354
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,175
Trouble.

355
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,344
Knights of Hell?
What were they doing there?

356
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:47,584
I'm not sure
of anything I saw that night.

357
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,619
We couldn't leave our room
after 10:00.

358
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,622
Mother Superior
forbade it.

359
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,433
Stay still.

360
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:51,915
I woke up in
a dark place, tied to a chair.

361
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,657
There were others.

362
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,226
They were taken.

363
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:32,289
I was so scared.

364
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,760
I prayed and prayed, but God
didn't answer my prayers.

365
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,194
Henry and Josie did.

366
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,999
<i>Exorcizamus te,</i>
<i>omnis immundus spiritus...</i>

367
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,369
<i>Ergo, Draco maledicte et omnis</i>
<i>legio diabolica,</i>

368
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,939
<i>adjuramus te.</i>
<i>Et secta diabolica!</i>

369
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:53,176
<i>Ut ecclesiam tuam secura tibi</i>
<i>facias libertate servire,</i>

370
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,545
<i>te rogamus, audi nos!</i>

371
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:13,630
<i>Exorcizamus te,</i>
<i>omnis immundus spiritus,</i>

372
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,666
<i>omnis satanica potestas,</i>

373
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,770
<i>omnis incursio</i>
<i>infernalis adversarii,</i>

374
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,272
<i>omnis legio!</i>

375
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,373
Henry!

376
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,277
You hunters are always
sticking your noses in

377
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,478
where they don't belong.

378
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,614
Hunters?

379
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,550
Please.

380
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,718
Then what are you?

381
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,653
Quickly, dear,

382
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,122
before this one pays
for your stubborness!

383
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,859
We are preceptors...

384
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,495
Beholders, chroniclers

385
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,330
of all that which man
does not understand.

386
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,232
A woman
amongst the Men of Letters?

387
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,800
Yes.

388
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:57,173
Well,
ain't that a blast.

389
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,612
You do know
what we're capable of, demon?

390
00:22:59,637 --> 00:23:00,344
Yes.

391
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,379
I know what you think
you're capable of,

392
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,781
but perhaps I should see
for myself.

393
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,416
Wait.
What are you doing?

394
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:12,288
I'm trading up from this bag
of bones to Mr. Dreamy here.

395
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:18,661
Then I can study your kind
real close.

396
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,699
Don't, or I'll --
or what?

397
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:29,773
Take me, not him.

398
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,612
You're joking.

399
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,314
I could be more useful
to you.

400
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,084
People underestimate
a woman.

401
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,988
No. That's not it.

402
00:23:47,224 --> 00:23:49,692
You love him.

403
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:52,328
He loves you, too,
you know.

404
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:56,533
Like a sister.

405
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:02,705
Please...

406
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,708
Spare him.

407
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,777
Take me.

408
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,713
You have my permission.

409
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:14,984
You've been very entertaining,
my dear.

410
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,987
But I don't need
your permission.

411
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:21,191
Abaddon takes
what she wants.

412
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:27,564
And right now,
she wants everything.

413
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:50,019
You're going to study
the Men of Letters?

414
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,255
For a moment.

415
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:56,092
And then
I'll destroy them.

416
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,360
And what of all this?

417
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,763
Keep it going
until I return.

418
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,699
Now play dead.

419
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:09,572
Henry!

420
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:14,577
Are you okay?

421
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,814
We did it.

422
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,583
We stopped the demons.

423
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,725
Abaddon.

424
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,595
Did you ever see exactly what
she was doing down there?

425
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:36,566
No, but whatever it was she was
doing at St. Bonaventure,

426
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,568
it seems
to be happening again.

427
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,937
The convent's name
was St. Bonaventure?

428
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,006
Yes.

429
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,514
Where is it?

430
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,183
On the outskirts of town.

431
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:55,418
It's been closed
for years.

432
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:04,427
I love this.
I really do.

433
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,496
Couple of cold ones,
a kind jukebox...

434
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,064
Good and evil,
bro-in down.

435
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,732
Shut your pie hole,
Crowley.

436
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,367
Yeah,
you said that already.

437
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:15,438
Look, I merely suggested
you might be a bit scared.

438
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,106
Yeah. No, I heard you
the first time.

439
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,108
You still don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

440
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,012
I know that Cain gave you
his Mark for a reason.

441
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,682
And I know that rather
than embracing it,

442
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,785
rather than looking at it
as the gift that it is,

443
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,887
you're sulking like
you lost your knuffle bunny.

444
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:35,358
Why are you fighting
what you really are?

445
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,859
I'm a hunter.

446
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,529
Who's a chip
off the old Mark of Cain.

447
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,166
No. When I kill,
I kill for a reason.

448
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,934
I'm nothing like Cain.

449
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,469
Nothing like --

450
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:49,205
who are you talking to?

451
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,341
I know you're not talking to me.
Eat me.

452
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,509
I saw you.
I saw the two of you together.

453
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,112
Nothing like Cain?
What's in that bottle? Delusion?

454
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,982
I'm really starting to worry
about you, Dean.

455
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,951
Yeah, well, why don't you worry
about yourself?

456
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,219
I will.

457
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,989
'Cause like it or not,
we're in this together.

458
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,324
Your problems,
my problems...

459
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,293
Our problems.

460
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,694
Where you going now?

461
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,664
I'm going
to go water the lily.

462
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,232
Care to cross streams?

463
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:19,135
So serious.

464
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,604
? You're no good,
you're no good, you're no good ?

465
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,707
? baby, you're no good ?

466
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:28,177
<i>Next time,</i>
<i>it'll be easier.</i>

467
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,213
That's it.

468
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:34,250
Good.

469
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,620
You'll get used to the feelings,
even welcome them.

470
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,589
? You're no good ?

471
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:46,296
? baby, you're no good ?

472
00:28:07,494 --> 00:28:08,861
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

473
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:10,296
Easy.
I know what you're thinking.

474
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:12,231
I'm thinking I'd like
to take a leak, so move.

475
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,935
I'm Dean Winchester. And I know
a hunter when I see one.

476
00:28:15,937 --> 00:28:18,671
You don't want to do
what you're about to do.

477
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:19,872
And why's that?

478
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:22,541
Because you're packing a knife
to a demon fight,

479
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:24,577
and you don't stand
a chance.

480
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:27,947
Then I'll go down swinging.

481
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:30,015
Hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me.

482
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:31,584
Any other day, I'd be
right there with you, brother.

483
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:32,618
I would, okay?

484
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,186
But you got to trust me
on this one.

485
00:28:34,188 --> 00:28:36,422
Or you could grow a pair
and come with.

486
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:39,191
You ever
taken on a demon before?

487
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:40,793
Yeah.

488
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:43,362
Well, trust me when I say
that when he's done with you,

489
00:28:43,364 --> 00:28:44,997
he's gonna go
after your family.

490
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:46,732
He's gonna go
after your friends.

491
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:48,434
Hell, he'll go
after your prom date.

492
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:49,935
So,
if you want to do that,

493
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,238
if you want to damn anyone
and everyone you've ever loved

494
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,640
in the slightest chance
that you could win,

495
00:28:54,642 --> 00:28:55,908
then by all means, pal.

496
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,310
You go right ahead.

497
00:29:05,218 --> 00:29:06,719
I got a kid sister.

498
00:29:07,988 --> 00:29:09,321
She don't deserve that.

499
00:29:09,323 --> 00:29:12,892
What's your name?

500
00:29:12,894 --> 00:29:15,094
Jake.

501
00:29:15,096 --> 00:29:16,595
Good to meet you, Jake.

502
00:29:16,597 --> 00:29:18,497
Thanks.

503
00:29:18,499 --> 00:29:20,833
I'll see you around.

504
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:35,247
Come on.
We got to go.

505
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,559
Demons don't take leaks.

506
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:22,728
Next time
you want to shoot up,

507
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,164
why don't you find
a better excuse?

508
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,333
Guilty as charged.

509
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:28,801
What happened? I thought
you were cleaning up your act.

510
00:30:28,803 --> 00:30:29,935
Well, I was going to,

511
00:30:29,937 --> 00:30:32,638
but then after
very little soul-searching,

512
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,907
I decided to embrace
my addiction.

513
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:36,108
What about you?

514
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:39,545
Takes a junkie
to know a junkie.

515
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:43,849
You just want to touch
that precious again, don't you?

516
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:48,220
I want to kill Abaddon.

517
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,055
That's what I want.

518
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:53,425
So, whatever happens with the
Blade, I can't worry about that.

519
00:30:53,427 --> 00:30:54,460
Sure.

520
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:56,061
Whatever you got
to tell yourself

521
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,330
so you can sleep better
at night.

522
00:30:58,332 --> 00:31:02,268
Look, what I want, what I fear,
none of that means squat.

523
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:07,072
Because this is the one chance
that we have to kill Abaddon.

524
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:10,376
So, I'm all in, no matter
what the consequences.

525
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:12,711
So the plan
remains the same?

526
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:14,947
I find her,
you bring the Blade.

527
00:31:14,949 --> 00:31:17,983
It's a date.

528
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:32,464
For a second there,
I thought he made me.

529
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:35,367
He has other things
on his mind.

530
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:38,037
But he did do
exactly what you said he would.

531
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,204
He saved you.

532
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:41,440
Of course he saved me.

533
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,275
We're besties.

534
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:46,879
And now he's ready.

535
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:15,300
Souls are a very precious
and fragile thing.

536
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:16,735
Break one of those,

537
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:19,471
and them little buggers fly
right back home.

538
00:33:19,473 --> 00:33:22,241
We can't have that,
now can we?

539
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,278
So,
after all these years,

540
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:31,050
you're still doing Abaddon's
dirty work, huh, Agnes?

541
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:33,352
Would you believe
it's gotten even dirtier?

542
00:33:33,354 --> 00:33:37,156
Used to be folks believed
in the church.

543
00:33:37,158 --> 00:33:39,892
Heck, the way they would come
strolling in here,

544
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:41,493
looking for God.

545
00:33:41,495 --> 00:33:45,264
It was like fish in a barrel,
really.

546
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:47,699
But times change.

547
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:49,735
You can blame your perverts
for that.

548
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:53,939
Now I'm riding shotgun in some
smelly van with a handyman

549
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:57,242
and tricking any half-wit
I can lay my hands on.

550
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,710
But it's worth it.

551
00:33:58,712 --> 00:33:59,745
Because...

552
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:03,549
Stealing souls is so noble.

553
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:05,350
Stealing souls is winning!

554
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:09,188
Winning what?

555
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,757
Hell's crown, nimrod.

556
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,426
You think Abaddon
is just gonna sit there

557
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:17,629
while those pantywaisted demons
refuse to pick a side?!

558
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:20,666
And so she made a plan --

559
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:23,235
if you can't convince 'em,
make 'em.

560
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:32,111
She's turning souls
into demons?

561
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:36,548
Hmm. A demon army, unbeatable,
loyal only to her.

562
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,650
Well, uh...

563
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:39,852
At this rate...

564
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:42,688
Should only take
a couple million years.

565
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,591
Have fun with that.

566
00:34:45,593 --> 00:34:48,360
You think
I'm the only one doing this?

567
00:34:49,996 --> 00:34:51,830
We have factories
spread throughout.

568
00:34:51,832 --> 00:34:55,300
Worry not, though.
Victory is nigh.

569
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,569
And we'd like you to be
on our team.

570
00:34:57,571 --> 00:34:59,805
Recruitment is easy.

571
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:03,509
I just have to rip your soul
out of your body.

572
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:06,345
<i>Regna terrae,</i>
<i>cantate deo --</i>

573
00:35:06,347 --> 00:35:07,746
Please!

574
00:35:15,422 --> 00:35:17,356

586
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,175
You know, um,
can I ask you something?

587
00:37:40,435 --> 00:37:42,085
If it's for a date,
I'm sorry.

588
00:37:42,086 --> 00:37:44,286
I never see anyone
under 65.

589
00:37:44,288 --> 00:37:45,487
Too much drama.

590
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:48,690
Spit it out.

591
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:55,097
After witnessing
what you did,

592
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:57,833
why didn't you warn Henry
about Abaddon?

593
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:07,409
I became a nun
because I wanted to help people.

594
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:10,579
Make a difference.

595
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:14,716
But they
never prepare you.

596
00:38:14,718 --> 00:38:19,788
They never tell you how to act
in the face of true evil.

597
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,128
Thank you, sister.

598
00:38:27,864 --> 00:38:29,865
For the safety
of all those involved,

599
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:34,636
it's important that we keep
what happened here today...

600
00:38:35,872 --> 00:38:37,973
...quiet.

601
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:40,909
Of course.

602
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,489
Soon after,
I left the order.

603
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:56,324
Why?

604
00:38:56,326 --> 00:38:59,261
Because I was ashamed.

605
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:04,399
I had betrayed our flock,
God, myself.

606
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:09,237
It was
and still is my greatest shame.

607
00:39:12,075 --> 00:39:14,976
Well, what you shared with me
saved lives.

608
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:18,547
And I couldn't have done that
without you.

609
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:21,450
Take care.

610
00:39:21,452 --> 00:39:23,685
You too, Sam.

611
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:46,608
You okay, Henry?

612
00:39:47,911 --> 00:39:49,711
Better.

613
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:53,048
We saved lives today.

614
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,750
We made a difference.

615
00:39:54,752 --> 00:39:55,951
Hmm.

616
00:39:55,953 --> 00:39:57,919
This -- our work...

617
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:01,890
It's a noble calling,
isn't it?

618
00:40:01,892 --> 00:40:05,026
I mean, yes, there's risk,
but, gosh.

619
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:08,196
I feel the fool for doubting it
for even a second.

620
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,397
Hmm.

621
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:12,134
And you, Josie?

622
00:40:12,136 --> 00:40:14,536
Me?

623
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:18,406
Well, I feel
like a whole new person.

624
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:54,576
Still plugging away?

625
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:56,711
Like a dog with a bone.

626
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:58,246
You?

627
00:41:14,797 --> 00:41:15,397
You were right.

628
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:20,635
About what?

629
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:23,972
Finding Abaddon ASAP.

630
00:41:26,676 --> 00:41:29,277
She's mining souls.

631
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,648
Why?

632
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,218
To create an army.

633
