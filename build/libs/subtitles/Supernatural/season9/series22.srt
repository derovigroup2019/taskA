1
00:00:02,441 --> 00:00:04,074
First time I touched that Blade,

2
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:05,411
I knew
that I wouldn't be stopped,

3
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:06,911
and that I would
take down Abaddon,

4
00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:08,513
and anything else
if I had to.

5
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:11,449
I'm glad the Blade gives you
strength or calm or whatever.

6
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:12,850
I got to say,
I'm starting to think

7
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:14,252
the Blade is doing
something else, too.

8
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:16,521
So, this war between angels
is really gonna happen, huh?

9
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:18,289
Not if I can find
a diplomatic option.

10
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,959
I know you truly believe
it's for the greater good.

11
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:23,795
Your mistaken trust in Metatron
will bring you down again.

12
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:25,897
The gates are sealed.
No one can get in.

13
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:27,432
Who said
anything about gates?

14
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,667
You don't need gates
when you have a private portal.

15
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:30,835
You can't hide
something like that.

16
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:33,171
You can if it moves around
from place to place,

17
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:35,673
if it's wherever
the boss wants it to be.

18
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:38,643
How's that stolen Grace
inside you working out?

19
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:39,711
It's fine.

20
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:40,778
No, it's not.

21
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,046
Dean.
Do I know you?

22
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:43,448
We go way back.

23
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:48,953
Tessa.

24
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:50,388
I know something
they don't know --

25
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,389
the ending.

26
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:52,824
How I get there
doesn't matter

27
00:00:52,826 --> 00:00:56,027
as long as everybody
plays their part.

28
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:04,802
Yeah...

29
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:07,672
Give me one scoop of the no-fat,
non-dairy vanilla,

30
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:09,640
with a quarter teaspoon
of the sugar-free caramel,

31
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:12,777
and 10 -- not 9,
not 11 -- blueberries.

32
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:13,811
Got it?

33
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:15,346
Good.

34
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:16,447
What do you want, honey?

35
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:18,182
That.

36
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:24,188
Excuse me.

37
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,758
I-I know this is
none of my business, but --

38
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,626
You're right.
It's not. Go away.

39
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:30,361
Where are your parents?

40
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:32,363
I don't have parents.

41
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:33,865
I'm an Angel.

42
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:36,067
Yeah, you're a little Angel.

43
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:39,637
Does your mother know
you're sitting here,

44
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,005
eating diabetes?

45
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:44,509
You need to run.
What?

46
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:47,578
Now!

47
00:01:56,488 --> 00:02:00,488

49
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:14,172
Nice reflexes.

50
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:15,273
Better hair.

51
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,708
What's wrong with you?

52
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,577
I could have shot you.

53
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:22,013
Why aren't you sleeping?
We got in like two hours ago.

54
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:23,514
Not tired.

55
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,049
And we got work to do,

56
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:27,785
so put on your dancing shoes,
and let's boogie.

57
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:35,426
All right.

58
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:37,228
What's up?

59
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,396
I called Cass.

60
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:40,298
He said there's something
going down in Missouri.

61
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,933
What kind of something?

62
00:02:41,935 --> 00:02:44,535
He said he couldn't talk
about it over the phone.

63
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:45,636
Why?

64
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:49,107
Because he is a weird guy,
okay?

65
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:51,742
He's a weird, dorky,
little guy.

66
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:54,212
But he happens to have an army
of Angels behind him,

67
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:56,013
and, even though
I hate to say it,

68
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:58,015
if we're gonna take a shot
at Metatron,

69
00:02:58,017 --> 00:02:59,350
they might be useful.

70
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:02,753
Well, do you think we need
the First Blade?

71
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:05,056
Why don't we just
leave that here?

72
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:07,284
We talked about this,
and we decided that --

73
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:08,193
No.

74
00:03:08,194 --> 00:03:10,928
In all fairness,
<i>we</i> didn't decide.

75
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,963
You did.

76
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:13,131
Okay, I decided

77
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,967
that a hockey stick
that can kill anything

78
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:18,102
might come in handy,
so sue me.

79
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:20,471
How many times have we
been around this block?

80
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:23,407
Magic that powerful comes
at a price,

81
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:25,676
and right now we don't know
what that price is.

82
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:27,512
I'm fine.

83
00:03:27,514 --> 00:03:29,313
I'm fan-friggin'-tastic.

84
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:30,348
And I'm glad, honestly.

85
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,083
I-I'm not saying
we bury the thing.

86
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:35,219
I'm saying we just save it
for when we really need it.

87
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:37,555
Crowley. Metatron.

88
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:39,423
The big boss fights.

89
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:41,993
You don't have to have it
with you all the time, right?

90
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:43,895
I mean, just leave it.

91
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:46,097
Please.

92
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:51,836
No problem.

93
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:54,005
Thank you.

94
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:09,620
Agents Spears
and Aguilera? FBI?

95
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:11,822
Uh-huh.

96
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:14,358
Your partner said
you'd be along.

97
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,727
Thank you.

98
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:22,200
Thank you for coming.

99
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:24,168
Spears and Aguilera?

100
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,170
I've noticed your aliases

101
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:26,971
are usually the names
of popular musicians.

102
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,574
Wow.

103
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:32,443
Come here.
Take a look at this.

104
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:37,048
Look.

105
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,749
And the other bodies
are the same --

106
00:04:39,818 --> 00:04:41,285
burnt-out husks.

107
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:43,054
Okay, so, what is this,
some sort of mass smiting?

108
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:44,989
I don't know
what this was.

109
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:47,725
Never seen
anything like it.

110
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:50,795
Six humans died here...

111
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:53,431
And one angel.

112
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:57,868
One of yours?

113
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,738
Was a good soldier.

114
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,075
This attack...

115
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:08,646
I knew he wanted a war,
but this...

116
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:12,016
This is abhorrent,
even for him.

117
00:05:23,263 --> 00:05:25,529
Uh...just a second!

118
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:31,869
I gave you a second.

119
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:35,239
You are such an...
angel sometimes.

120
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:37,208
What do you want?

121
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,243
To talk about tonight.

122
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:41,379
We'll be fine.

123
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:45,016
No, we --
we're losing, Metatron.

124
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:47,485
Castiel's followers
outnumber us.

125
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:49,420
And while they haven't gone
on offense,

126
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:50,821
they have proven capable.

127
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:52,423
They stopped you
from killing him,

128
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:53,891
and me, for example.

129
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:56,727
I told you, we had our shot
with operation Lee Harvey,

130
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:57,795
and we took it.

131
00:05:57,797 --> 00:06:00,064
I gave the orders.

132
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:01,866
You weren't to be harmed.

133
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:03,301
You had me followed.

134
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:05,436
Yeah, and you met
with the enemy...

135
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:06,904
In secret.

136
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:11,509
What is that old line
about sins and stones?

137
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:16,414
He spoke. He lied.
And I listened.

138
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,282
That's it.

139
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:19,950
But I serve heaven.

140
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:21,619
I serve you.

141
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,487
Good.

142
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:25,790
Don't forget it.

143
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:34,131
I mean, I-I don't get this
whole Cass lovefest, either.

144
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:37,601
I'm offering our people
a way home,

145
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:41,272
and still -- still,
they're choosing him over me.

146
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:43,908
I mean, sure, he's cute.

147
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:51,315
And Castiel has
this simple...charm.

148
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:55,353
He's like
a mentally deficient puppy.

149
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:58,055
But I'm lovable.

150
00:06:58,057 --> 00:07:00,991
And funny.

151
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,763
I made God laugh --
twice!

152
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:08,265
You're the one who asked him
to lead an army.

153
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:10,334
Well, I didn't think
he'd be good at it.

154
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:13,504
Your meeting tonight --
Tyrus --

155
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:15,940
he controls
the largest independent faction

156
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:17,408
of angels left, and --

157
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,010
And I have to make
a good impression. I know.

158
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:23,214
I've got a plan.

159
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:29,854
It's not that, is it?

160
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,324
Shut up!

161
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:37,795
Commander.

162
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:40,264
Oh,
it's just creepy.

163
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:43,634
Sam, Dean,
this is Hannah.

164
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:47,271
The Winchesters --
I've heard so much about you.

165
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:49,440
What can I say?
Cass is a fan.

166
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:50,950
I'll start
to examine this evidence.

167
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:51,706
Y-- oh, um...

168
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:54,396
Sir, this morning,
Josiah wasn't at roll call.

169
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:57,381
Uh, roll call?

170
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:59,049
You hold, uh, roll call?

171
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:01,085
They like to hear me
say their names.

172
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:03,187
I know a couple of women
like that.

173
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:04,822
No one's seen Josiah
since Ezra was murdered.

174
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,508
We think that --

175
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,848
You think Josiah's the killer,
that he is the mole?

176
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:09,460
Well, who else?

177
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,530
We searched the grounds,
but he's vanished.

178
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:14,398
Not without wings.

179
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,534
He's an angel, but he's still got
to travel like he's a human,

180
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:19,970
which means walk, drive --
means he's gonna leave a trail.

181
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:22,173
All right.

182
00:08:22,175 --> 00:08:24,041
What was
his vessel's name?

183
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:26,210
Sean Flynn from Omaha.

184
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:35,686
This the guy?

185
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:37,288
Yeah, that's him.

186
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,024
All right.

187
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:42,593
Looks like someone
just used his credit card

188
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:44,261
at a Gas-n-Sip
in Colorado.

189
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:47,431
And that's how we do things
in the pros.

190
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:49,099
Commander.

191
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:53,337
I have something.

192
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,773
This phone's memory chip
has a video time-stamped

193
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:56,775
just before the explosion.

194
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,843
And now the moment you've all
been waiting for.

195
00:08:57,844 --> 00:08:59,543
- What?
- No!

196
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:03,848
I do this for Castiel!

197
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:18,711
What the hell was that?

198
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:20,427
I don't know.

199
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:23,463
I didn't --
I would never ask an angel

200
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:25,598
to sacrifice himself
to kill innocents.

201
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,501
I'm gonna be sick.

202
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:31,170
Cass, why would an angel blow up
a Colonel Scoop's in your name?

203
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:32,772
That's not
what he was doing.

204
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:34,507
Roll it back.

205
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:38,911
There.

206
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,013
That was an angel --
Esther.

207
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,217
She's one of Metatron's.

208
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,820
So, this was some kind of hit?
I don't know.

209
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:49,422
Stop saying
you don't know.

210
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:51,624
You can't think I would
allow something like this.

211
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,326
Cass, I know you try
to be a good guy, okay?

212
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:54,627
I do. You try.

213
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:57,396
But what you got here,
this is a a freakin' cult.

214
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,165
Dean. And the last time
you had this kind of juice,

215
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,734
you did kill humans and angels,
and you did nothing

216
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:03,736
but lie to me and Sam
about it the whole damn time!

217
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:06,572
Can we, uh -- can we take this
somewhere else, guys?

218
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,511
Will you
stow the baggage, Dean.

219
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,180
Look, we've got a case.

220
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:15,881
Let's work it.

221
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,784
Cass, did you know
the angel in that video?

222
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:21,954
Yes. His name was Oren.
He was a new recruit.

223
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,757
He worked in community outreach.
And what does that mean?

224
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,259
Some of my troops are stationed
at a local hospital.

225
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:29,161
They help where they can.

226
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:31,831
Minor miracles -- it's nothing
that would attention.

227
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,033
So, what was he doing in
that video, with the stabbing?

228
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:35,868
The Enochian runes
that were carved in his chest --

229
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,805
I...I think that they
were meant to focus energy.

230
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:42,742
When he stabbed himself,
it unleashed all that power.

231
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:44,477
So, what about the girl?
What happened to her?

232
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:47,213
If she was the target,
if the blast was focused on her,

233
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:50,583
then more likely than not,
she -- she was atomized.

234
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,854
So, what do we do now?

235
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:56,489
Well,
you don't do jack.

236
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:58,124
Me and Sam will head
to the hospital,

237
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:00,726
see if we can find somebody
who knew this...walking nuke.

238
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,395
Hold on. These are my people.
I can help.

239
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:04,030
Well,
that's sort of the problem.

240
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:06,432
I mean, the Manson girls aren't
gonna give us a straight answer

241
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:09,235
with Charlie in the room,
so just hang back.

242
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:11,103
So, I should just sit here?

243
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:13,139
Pretty much.

244
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:14,140
No.

245
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:16,075
If you don't want
my help,

246
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:18,811
then I will follow
Josiah's trail to Colorado.

247
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,981
I have to do something,
Dean.

248
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,717
All right, fine.

249
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,819
But Sam's coming with you.

250
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,721
What?
Because you don't trust me?

251
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:30,523
To help.

252
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,835
Abaddon is dead.

253
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,639
And then some.

254
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,908
Oh, no.

255
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,743
Okay. Um...

256
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:53,312
Ominous.

257
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:58,384
Does Dean
seem different to you?

258
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,152
Yeah.

259
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:03,589
Lately, he seems to be...

260
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:05,658
Amped up --
you know, on edge.

261
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,760
Effects of the mark?

262
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:09,562
What else?

263
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:11,197
He does seem angry.

264
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,665
I mean,
he's always a little angry,

265
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,533
but now it seems like...

266
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,402
More.

267
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:19,205
I think a part of him
actually believed

268
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:23,008
that I ordered those angels
to, you know...

269
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,846
Sam, you don't, do you?

270
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,984
No, man. Cass, listen.

271
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:33,986
You got a weird thing
going on back there.

272
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:36,188
Those other angels,
the way they stare at you,

273
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,060
I-it's like you're part
rock star, part L. Ron.

274
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:44,130
They've put
their faith in me.

275
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:45,531
And maybe
that's the problem.

276
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,433
I mean, people have been
doing messed up crap

277
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:51,270
in the name of faith --
in the name of God --

278
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:54,106
since forever.

279
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:56,075
Well...

280
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:58,844
I'm not trying to...
play God.

281
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:01,514
I'm just trying
to get my people home.

282
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:10,723
Yes!

283
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,858
Well done!

284
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,060
It's such
a simple game.

285
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,563
And boy, you got to love
the sound of those pins.

286
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,368
Beautiful --
a symphony of wood.

287
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,841
So,
you've heard our offer.

288
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:30,876
Yeah,
I sign on the dotted line,

289
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:34,480
and, well, my people,
they get a ticket upstairs.

290
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:36,615
What if
we don't want to go?

291
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:37,683
But it's home.

292
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:38,851
It's boring.

293
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,789
I mean, you -- there's nothing
like this in heaven.

294
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,960
I could whip you up
a bowling alley.

295
00:13:47,962 --> 00:13:49,662
Eh, but it wouldn't...

296
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:51,864
I mean,
just smell that.

297
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:54,433
Mmm.

298
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:57,903
Old shoes and...
Alcoholism? I...

299
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,472
Authenticity.
So, wait.

300
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:03,809
You're turning me down
because of...bowling?

301
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:06,545
And I like being
an independent operator.

302
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:09,515
And I hear you're losing.

303
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,984
And I hate your face.

304
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,088
Well,
I could get a new face.

305
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,189
You'd still be you --

306
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:21,093
a nerd trying to be
one of the popular kids.

307
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:22,127
Mnh-mnh.

308
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,129
Okay.

309
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,198
Time for the hard sell.

310
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,172
Please.

311
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:38,043
You knife me, and all my guys
will go running to Castiel.

312
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,218
Even you're
not that stupid.

313
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,155
But tell you what,
huh?

314
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:54,260
You out-bowl me,
we'll talk?

315
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,935
Ma yeah,
I saw him, officer.

316
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:04,670
He filled up some old,
uh, woody station wagon.

317
00:15:04,672 --> 00:15:07,139
Don't suppose you, uh, got
the license plate number?

318
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,374
No.

319
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:10,943
But he was headed to an address
in Pray, Montana.

320
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:13,245
How do you know that?

321
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,813
Guy asked
for directions.

322
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:15,915
Oh.

323
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:18,350
Uh, you want me
to write that down?

324
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:19,451
Yes.

325
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,453
Now. Please.

326
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,455
What do I call you?

327
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,891
My angelic name
is 18 syllables long.

328
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:27,526
Let's stick
with Flagstaff.

329
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:28,894
Copy.

330
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,896
So, you knew
this Oren guy?

331
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:34,199
We worked together
at the hospital.

332
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:37,403
He was a joy --
bright, full of life.

333
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:39,838
Yeah, I hear he had
a real explosive personality.

334
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,674
Do you think
this is a joke?

335
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:43,709
Do you see me laughing?

336
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:48,781
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

337
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:53,118
For example,
why he'd light his own fuse.

338
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,386
No.

339
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:55,587
Can I go?

340
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,156
I have lives to save.

341
00:15:57,158 --> 00:15:58,757
Welcome to the club.

342
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,794
Something funny?

343
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:03,629
Not funny "ha ha."

344
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:06,198
But you
thinking you help people --

345
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,167
it's amusing.

346
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:10,336
I help people.

347
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:12,438
A clogged artery here,
a tumor there.

348
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,872
I do good in this world.

349
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:17,276
You -- you believe every problem
can be solved with a gun.

350
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:19,545
You play the hero,
but underneath the hype,

351
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:23,515
you're a killer with oceans
of blood on his hands.

352
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:26,051
I hate men like you.

353
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:36,195
Honey, there ain't
no other men like me.

354
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:38,764
Don't...please.

355
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:40,733
Oren. Friends?

356
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:43,102
Constantine...

357
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:45,437
And Tessa.

358
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,905
Tessa?

359
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,273
The reaper, Tessa?

360
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,142
You know her?

361
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:08,248
That looks like the car

362
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:09,929
the guy at the gas station
was talking about, right?

363
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,563
Maybe
Josiah's still around.

364
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:13,999
Sam, this place is...

365
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,301
radiating power.

366
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:19,471
I haven't felt anything
like this since...

367
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:20,939
since heaven.

368
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,775
We have to get in here.

369
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,888
All right.

370
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,992
Step aside.

371
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,262
I got this.

372
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,073
I don't got this.

373
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,952
Howdy, Tessa.

374
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:14,493
You're supposed to be working
at the hospital tonight,

375
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,762
but when I stopped by,
you were gone.

376
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:19,565
So was an ambulance.

377
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,701
Pro tip --
they all have GPS.

378
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:23,936
Good to know.

379
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:27,005
So, you're here. Why?

380
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:29,541
You just
love musical theater?

381
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:32,144
Only if it's "Fiddler."

382
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:33,912
We need to talk.

383
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:36,448
Can't. Sorta got a date.

384
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,887
Not happening.

385
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,358
Where's the other one?

386
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,261
Where's Constantine?

387
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,532
Better luck next time.
Thanks.

388
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,068
Metatron!

389
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,172
I do this for Castiel.

390
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,200
I checked all the windows
and doors. No luck.

391
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,001
What about you?
You find anything?

392
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:16,237
I think so.

393
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,473
It's Enochian.

394
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:21,609
I believe
it's some sort of riddle.

395
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,382
"Why is six afraid
of seven?"

396
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:31,753
Now, I assume it's
because seven is a prime number,

397
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:34,889
and prime numbers
can be intimidating.

398
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:36,657
It's because seven eight nine.

399
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,430
It's wordplay.

400
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,865
And the answer
is the key,

401
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:46,267
like the doors of Durin
in "Lord of the Rings."

402
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,935
Wait a second.

403
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,537
You know about
"The Lord of the Rings?"

404
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:52,874
I'm very
pop-culture savvy now.

405
00:19:58,148 --> 00:19:59,180
Hey.

406
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:00,681
How is he?

407
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:01,749
He's, uh...

408
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,217
He's Cass.

409
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:05,720
What about you? How's it going?
Great.

410
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:07,355
Went out, got some air.

411
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:10,091
Met an old friend.

412
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:12,560
Say hi to Sam, Tessa.

413
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,195
Your brother's a psycho,
Sam.

414
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:15,663
Stop.

415
00:20:15,665 --> 00:20:16,864
What's going on?

416
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:18,633
You first.

417
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,001
I know
he's the commander's friend,

418
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,069
and I know we're supposed
to pretend we like him,

419
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:25,673
but that ape put a knife
to my throat.

420
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,676
Tessa?

421
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:31,212
What are you doing?

422
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:33,347
You want to tell her?

423
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,386
Oh, God.

424
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:40,855
There's no God.

425
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:42,290
There's only Castiel.

426
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:43,558
Oh, and you're done.

427
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:49,163
You wounded her.

428
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,969
More like "defused,"
okay?

429
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,138
I cut up
that old testament graffiti

430
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,372
she carved into herself.

431
00:20:58,374 --> 00:20:59,807
I figured
that would break the spell.

432
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,108
And now...

433
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,677
What will you do to her?

434
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:05,713
Guess.

435
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,748
Torture. Predictable.

436
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,851
We need to know if there
are other bombers out there.

437
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,018
No.

438
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,053
I won't allow it.

439
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:14,422
I know
what Tessa was planning.

440
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:19,527
It's horrible, but there's only
one person who can punish her.

441
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,229
Let me guess.

442
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:24,065
Yea big, trench coat,
sensible shoes?

443
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,433
You have to understand
that Castiel

444
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:26,968
is the only thing
holding us together.

445
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,370
A month ago,
half the angels in this place

446
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,072
were trying
to kill the other half.

447
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:32,940
Castiel has given us
a purpose.

448
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:35,710
But more than that, he has
given us a way to live in peace.

449
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,045
We have rules. Order.

450
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:41,148
If I let you take matters
into your own hands,

451
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,117
what's to stop one of them
from doing the same?

452
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,654
You can talk to her.

453
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:49,757
You should talk to her.

454
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,659
But leave
the Blade outside.

455
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:58,566
Are you asking
or telling?

456
00:21:58,568 --> 00:21:59,934
We're not asking.

457
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:25,760
You sure you don't want
to go back, Cass?

458
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,296
Look, if Dean
is right about Tessa...

459
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:31,332
No,
I, uh...I do.

460
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:34,969
I just...
give me a second.

461
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,776
"Only the penitent man
shall pass"?

462
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:45,780
Cass, wait!

463
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,072
"The Last Crusade."

464
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:12,406
Okay.

465
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:16,110
Well, let's start
with an easy one.

466
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:17,812
Who are you working for?

467
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,747
Castiel.
Liar.

468
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:25,152
People like you,
they never understand.

469
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,521
Sacrifices
have to be made.

470
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,791
So you go after
one of the bad guys,

471
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:33,527
and if a few humans
get microwaved,

472
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,029
no big deal, right?

473
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:38,699
In the grand scheme,
they don't matter.

474
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:42,069
Oh, Tessa,
you are so wrong.

475
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:46,874
When Castiel came to me
and told me what I had to do,

476
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:51,078
he said I was chosen
because I was strong.

477
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,913
Others...

478
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:55,950
They couldn't handle this.

479
00:23:57,652 --> 00:23:59,854
They're too weak.

480
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:08,462
Settle down!

481
00:24:08,464 --> 00:24:11,999
Is -- do you think
she's telling the truth?

482
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:15,369
<i>She</i> thinks she is.

483
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,242
Sam.

484
00:24:21,244 --> 00:24:23,611
We found it.
What?

485
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:26,647
It's the door to heaven.

486
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:28,215
Seriously?

487
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,117
What else would Metatron

488
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,153
go to such great lengths
to protect?

489
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:33,421
I can hear it.

490
00:24:33,423 --> 00:24:35,222
It's calling to me,
Sam.

491
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,124
If we control this door,

492
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:39,593
we can take the fight
to Metatron.

493
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,664
We may not even need
to fight at all.

494
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,032
Cass, wait.

495
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:55,876
? Heaven

496
00:24:55,878 --> 00:25:01,215
? I'm in heaven ?

497
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:03,784
What the hell?
? and my heart beats so

498
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:08,856
? that I can hardly speak

499
00:25:08,858 --> 00:25:12,827
? and I seem to find

500
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:15,196
? the happiness I seek

501
00:25:15,198 --> 00:25:18,933
"Welcome to your own personal
heaven, Castiel.

502
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,468
Good luck finding the real one."

503
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,603
? When we're out together ?
but...Why?

504
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,672
? Dancing cheek to cheek

505
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,514
It's Josiah.

506
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:36,183
He reeks of holy oil.

507
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:40,654
Yeah.

508
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:42,690
Looks like he got
"Home Alone"-ed.

509
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:49,563
So, all of this --
it was a a lie.

510
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,600
Supposed to be here...

511
00:25:52,602 --> 00:25:55,402
Gate...

512
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:57,138
He told me...

513
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,475
After Ezra, he told me
that I should come to him.

514
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:06,514
Metatron told me
that I could go home.

515
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:10,284
I just wanted to go home.

516
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:12,520
Here. Let me --
No!

517
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:17,258
I would rather die than owe
my life to you, Castiel.

518
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,162
You play at being noble.

519
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:25,499
You play
at being one of us.

520
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,069
But I look
into your eyes...

521
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:32,239
And I don't see
an angel staring back at me.

522
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,090
Where's your friend?

523
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:52,193
Just you and me now.

524
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,228
Let's talk about us.

525
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,163
I mean,
we got history, yeah?

526
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:57,932
Sure.

527
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:00,301
I still remember
our meet-cute.

528
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:01,936
You were dying.

529
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:03,737
Good times.

530
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:05,839
Here's the deal.

531
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,841
I like you, Tess, okay?

532
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,009
For an angel.

533
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:11,345
But tell me,
why are you doing this?

534
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:12,680
Castiel.

535
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:15,683
No, forget Cass.
Why are <i>you</i> doing this?

536
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:18,152
What would make a person want
to pop their top, huh?

537
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:20,387
I mean, look,
I've been in bad shape.

538
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,357
I have. But I have never been
that damn low.

539
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:29,096
I guess I just
can't take the screaming.

540
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:34,768
Who's screaming?

541
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,938
All of them.

542
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,840
The lost souls.

543
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,909
The ones that can't get
into heaven

544
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,777
now that it's been
boarded up.

545
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:46,780
I hear them.

546
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:50,884
They are so confused.

547
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,320
They're in so much pain.

548
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:57,057
All I want to do
is help them.

549
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,227
It's what I do.
It's my job.

550
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:03,731
But I can't.

551
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:06,367
So I suffered...

552
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:10,704
Until death,

553
00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:13,507
nothingness.

554
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,879
Suddenly,
it didn't seem so bad.

555
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:21,415
It seemed quiet.

556
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:23,217
So, why don't you
just jam an angel blade

557
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:25,019
in your throat
and call it a day?

558
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:28,355
I thought about it...

559
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:31,091
But I was too weak...

560
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:33,694
Till Castiel gave me
a reason to die.

561
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:35,229
Yeah.

562
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:37,164
See, that just doesn't sound
like the Cass I know.

563
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,534
But doesn't it, though?

564
00:28:40,536 --> 00:28:43,604
And the Cass you know,
would he raise

565
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:46,740
an army of angels
without telling you?

566
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:48,942
'Cause this Cass did.

567
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:54,748
I'll tell you a secret.

568
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,785
There's more out there...

569
00:28:57,787 --> 00:28:59,887
Like me.

570
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:01,121
So many more.

571
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:03,624
You got names?

572
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:06,427
That would
ruin all the fun.

573
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:08,228
No.

574
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,164
No, see...

575
00:29:14,102 --> 00:29:15,936
...the fun's just
getting started.

576
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:17,237
Dean,
what have you done?

577
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,972
What I had to.

578
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:21,909
Welcome to the club.

579
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:27,981
Thank you.

580
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:07,698
He put up a fight.

581
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:11,302
Get out.

582
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:14,939
You should have seen
the other 10 guys.

583
00:30:14,941 --> 00:30:16,207
They said
you killed Tessa?

584
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:18,009
Not so much.

585
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:19,677
She knifed herself.

586
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,779
Yeah? Why would she
do that, Dean?

587
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:23,080
I don't know, Sam.

588
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:24,782
She was saying
all kinds of crap.

589
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:26,585
So that's why you brought out
the First Blade?

590
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,087
They told you
about that, huh?

591
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:31,489
We had a deal.

592
00:30:31,491 --> 00:30:34,191
Yeah, well, it was a stupid deal.
Really?

593
00:30:34,193 --> 00:30:36,761
'Cause if you'd stuck to it,
Tessa would still be alive.

594
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:38,396
Without her,
we ain't got jack.

595
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:39,597
Yeah, you think
I don't know that?

596
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,865
You think I wanted
that to happen?

597
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:41,932
I don't know, Dean.
Did you?

598
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:42,967
All right, that's enough.

599
00:30:42,969 --> 00:30:44,702
Stop it.

600
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:48,072
Commander,
I'm sorry, but...

601
00:30:48,074 --> 00:30:50,341
You have a call...

602
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:52,276
From Metatron.

603
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:03,387
Castiel.

604
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:05,756
Bet you're not happy to see me.

605
00:31:05,758 --> 00:31:07,191
Is anyone ever?

606
00:31:07,193 --> 00:31:12,129
Dean, always with the B-grade
'80s-action-movie wit.

607
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:14,999
What do you want,
Metatron?

608
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:18,769
Just to tell ass-tiel, there,
that I'm still alive.

609
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:20,338
His bomber failed.

610
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,007
My bomber?
The crazy guy.

611
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:25,009
Big knife. Kablooey.

612
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:28,646
I'm fine, thanks for asking,
but Gadreel is wounded,

613
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:32,817
- and Tyrus...
- R.I.P.

614
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:35,986
His followers are not
your biggest fans, by the way.

615
00:31:35,988 --> 00:31:37,254
They've all come over
to my team.

616
00:31:37,256 --> 00:31:39,423
I didn't send anyone
to kill you.

617
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:41,826
Oh, stop lying, Castiel.

618
00:31:41,828 --> 00:31:44,028
Who are you to lecture me
on lying?

619
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,831
Your deception led
to the fall.

620
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,734
I did what I had to do.

621
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:53,070
I have always done
what I have to do,

622
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:56,907
for God and for the angels.

623
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:59,110
Sure. Yeah, you're mother Teresa
with neck beard.

624
00:31:59,112 --> 00:32:01,645
What I did was
neither good nor bad.

625
00:32:01,647 --> 00:32:05,883
It was necessary --
a small hardship to...

626
00:32:05,885 --> 00:32:08,519
Make us all stronger,
to make us a family again.

627
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:11,188
Yeah, except for the angels
you had Gadreel kill.

628
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,824
Okay, yes.

629
00:32:13,826 --> 00:32:18,129
Maybe I got
a little carried away at first,

630
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:19,997
but those days are over.

631
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:23,100
A near-death experience
makes you re-evaluate.

632
00:32:23,102 --> 00:32:28,105
So, one time only,
I'm offering amnesty.

633
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:32,576
Every angel,
no matter what their sin,

634
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:36,247
may join me
and return to heaven.

635
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:38,883
I will be their God,

636
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:42,520
and they can be
my heavenly host.

637
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:44,355
Why would we follow you?

638
00:32:44,357 --> 00:32:47,425
Well, look around.

639
00:32:47,427 --> 00:32:49,059
You've seen earth.

640
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:51,462
You've had a taste of free will.

641
00:32:51,464 --> 00:32:53,631
I got to ask you --
do you like it?

642
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:57,101
I mean, the way you've flocked
off to follow Castiel

643
00:32:57,103 --> 00:32:59,870
tells me you need
to follow someone.

644
00:32:59,872 --> 00:33:01,372
It's in your DNA.

645
00:33:01,374 --> 00:33:05,142
But Cass --
he's not what you think he is.

646
00:33:05,144 --> 00:33:10,581
He sends angels out to die.

647
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:14,785
Have you told them about
your stolen Grace, Castiel?

648
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:18,456
How it's fading away,

649
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:21,525
and when it burns out,
so will you?

650
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:26,297
So...

651
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:27,798
No, then.

652
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:33,999
I'm not the best,
but I'm the best you've got.

653
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,874
You want to stay
with Castiel, fine,

654
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:39,977
but he's playing you,
because at the end of the day,

655
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:41,679
the only thing he cares about

656
00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:44,982
is himself
and the Hardy boys there.

657
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:48,052
You've got a choice to make.

658
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:50,421
Make the right one.

659
00:33:57,395 --> 00:33:58,896
He's lying.

660
00:33:58,898 --> 00:34:00,931
About the Grace?

661
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:05,469
It's complicated.

662
00:34:05,471 --> 00:34:06,537
So he <i>wasn't</i> lying.

663
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:09,540
He was about
everything else. He...

664
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:19,049
You believe me,
don't you?

665
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:22,253
I want to believe you,
but I...

666
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:27,391
We need proof.

667
00:34:27,393 --> 00:34:28,392
Name it.

668
00:34:28,394 --> 00:34:30,427
Punish him.
What?

669
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,062
He murdered Tessa.

670
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,297
He broke our rules.

671
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:36,000
Y'all can all go to hell.

672
00:34:36,002 --> 00:34:37,935
Dean.

673
00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:39,470
Hey, wait a sec--

674
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:44,375
You gave us order, Castiel,
and we gave you our trust.

675
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:49,613
Don't lose it
over one man.

676
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:54,885
This is justice.

677
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:22,513
No. I can't.

678
00:35:30,743 --> 00:35:34,212
Goodbye, Castiel.

679
00:36:01,181 --> 00:36:02,782
You're right.

680
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:04,984
There is no other side.

681
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:09,789
Well, welcome aboard.

682
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:14,127
Well...

683
00:36:14,129 --> 00:36:17,830
The first of Castiel's flock
has come around.

684
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:20,400
The rest will follow.

685
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:24,170
You should have told me
what our elite unit was for.

686
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:25,872
Why? It was none
of your business.

687
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:28,708
Tessa, Constantine --

688
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,878
I recruited them,
and you...

689
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,547
Brainwashed them
into blowing themselves up.

690
00:36:34,549 --> 00:36:37,317
So?

691
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:40,486
Well, that's an old
writer's trick --

692
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:42,155
flipping the script.

693
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:47,894
You start by building up
a seemingly unbeatable enemy,

694
00:36:47,896 --> 00:36:49,595
like the death star,

695
00:36:49,597 --> 00:36:54,867
or a rival angel
with a bigger army.

696
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:56,936
That way,
I look like the underdog.

697
00:36:56,938 --> 00:36:58,972
But then, oh, no!

698
00:36:58,974 --> 00:37:01,674
The competition
gets greedy.

699
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:04,744
He starts pushing things
too much...

700
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:09,349
With the help
of my combustible double agents.

701
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:13,219
And then,
after a rousing speech,

702
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:16,489
his true weakness
is revealed.

703
00:37:17,331 --> 00:37:21,633
He's in love
with humanity.

704
00:37:21,635 --> 00:37:24,236
And now...

705
00:37:27,608 --> 00:37:29,775
I'm inevitable.

706
00:37:29,777 --> 00:37:32,778
What about Josiah?

707
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,546
Mm.

708
00:37:34,548 --> 00:37:36,381
He was a loose end.

709
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:40,786
I -- I told him
where the gate was...

710
00:37:40,788 --> 00:37:42,287
Before we moved it.

711
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:46,592
I just wish Cass had walked
into one of those traps.

712
00:37:48,596 --> 00:37:51,230
Anyway, point is --

713
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:54,433
while everyone else
is playing checkers,

714
00:37:54,435 --> 00:37:56,768
I'm playing monopoly,

715
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,606
and I always build a hotel
on Boardwalk.

716
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,509
And I always win.

717
00:38:31,471 --> 00:38:33,005
So, Dean, uh...

718
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:35,140
Are we gonna talk about this,
or what?

719
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:36,541
About what?

720
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:39,544
Yeah, I lied,
but you were being an infant.

721
00:38:39,546 --> 00:38:41,380
Wow.

722
00:38:41,382 --> 00:38:43,916
Even for you,
that apology sucked.

723
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:45,317
Oh,
I'm not apologizing.

724
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,985
I'm telling you
how it's gonna be.

725
00:38:46,987 --> 00:38:48,720
Dean, that Blade --

726
00:38:48,722 --> 00:38:50,455
That Blade's the only thing
that can kill Metatron,

727
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:52,157
and I am the only one
who can use it...

728
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:55,294
...so from here on out,
I'm calling the shots.

729
00:38:55,296 --> 00:38:56,595
Capisce?

730
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:00,599
Look, until I jam that Blade
through that douchebag's heart,

731
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:02,968
we are not a team.

732
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,803
This is a dictatorship.

733
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:09,308
Now, you don't have to like it,
but that's how it's gonna be.

734
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:17,115
So, batteries...

735
00:39:19,953 --> 00:39:22,487
I'm fine.
No, you're not.

736
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:24,189
How long you got?

737
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:27,192
Long enough
to destroy Metatron, I hope.

738
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:30,929
But without an army...

739
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:33,598
Well, hey,
you still got us.

740
00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:40,205
Dean.

741
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:44,176
Those bombers --
you don't really think that I --

742
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:47,112
Cass, you just gave up
an entire army for one guy.

743
00:39:47,114 --> 00:39:51,717
No, there's no way
that you blew those people away.

744
00:39:56,723 --> 00:40:00,158
You really believe
we three will be enough?

745
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,128
We always have been.

746
00:40:09,435 --> 00:40:11,670
Guys!

747
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:14,172
I'm not here to fight.

748
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:17,843
I thought
about what you said.

749
00:40:17,845 --> 00:40:19,745
You're right.

750
00:40:19,747 --> 00:40:21,546
Metatron, he's...

751
00:40:22,882 --> 00:40:25,417
...something
needs to be done.

752
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:27,552
And we should
trust you why?

753
00:40:27,554 --> 00:40:29,588
Because I can give him
to you.

754
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,590
I know where Metatron is.

755
00:40:31,592 --> 00:40:33,992
I know everything.

756
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,696
I know the bombers.
They...

757
00:40:37,698 --> 00:40:41,466
They were his agents,
not yours.

758
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:47,572
You don't trust me, fine.

759
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:49,941
I understand. I've...

760
00:40:49,943 --> 00:40:52,511
...Made mistakes.

761
00:40:52,513 --> 00:40:54,980
But haven't you?

762
00:40:54,982 --> 00:40:56,982
Haven't we all?

763
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,621
At least give me a chance.
