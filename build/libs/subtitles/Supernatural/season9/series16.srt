1
00:00:02,723 --> 00:00:03,823
Henry Winchester.

2
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:05,224
That's
our grandfather.

3
00:00:05,226 --> 00:00:06,525
You're Men of Letters,
correct?

4
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:07,760
Our father
taught us how to be hunters.

5
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:09,095
You're legacies.

6
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:10,930
Preceptors, beholders,

7
00:00:10,932 --> 00:00:13,699
chroniclers of all that which
man does not understand.

8
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:16,102
Larry Ganem and Albert Magnus --
all deceased.

9
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:17,022
Albertus Magnus --

10
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:19,816
his was the alias we'd use
when going incognito.

11
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:22,041
Here's the deal --

12
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:23,442
you're gonna tell us
how to hack an angel,

13
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:25,611
and I'm gonna give you
some human blood.

14
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:26,912
Word is you're
jonesing for it.

15
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:29,315
The Knights of Hell
aren't exactly the dying kind.

16
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:31,684
But there is <i>something</i>
that can kill a knight.

17
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:32,985
The First Blade.

18
00:00:32,987 --> 00:00:34,720
It's the bloody mark
of Cain.

19
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:37,022
Without the Mark,
the blade is useless.

20
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:38,424
The Mark can be transferred
to someone who's worthy.

21
00:00:38,426 --> 00:00:41,227
But you have to know, with
the mark comes a great burden.

22
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,554
So, where is The Blade?

23
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:43,997
I threw it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.

24
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:46,398
<i>You</i> can't search the
bottom of the ocean, but <i>I</i> can.

25
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,102
So, I'll find it and
bring it to its new owner.

26
00:00:55,743 --> 00:00:58,477
Come on, Crowley.
Pick up!

27
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,279
Where the hell is he?

28
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:02,081
It's not like
he's got a social life.

29
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,784
Uh, are you
actually worried?

30
00:01:04,786 --> 00:01:07,520
<i>Too busy</i>
<i>inflicting pain to answer.</i>

31
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:09,822
<i>Leave a message.</i>
Guy's got one job --

32
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:12,491
find the First Blade,
bring it back. How hard is that?

33
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:15,361
It's Crowley.
He's not exactly a team player.

34
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:17,163
Yeah, but his ass
is on the line, too.

35
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:19,331
He goes missing for weeks on end
without a peep?

36
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,634
Well, not one
that makes sense, anyway.

37
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:22,868
Listen to this.

38
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,838
<i>Dean. Um...</i>

39
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:32,645
Wait a second.

40
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:35,447
Did he...Drunk-dial you?

41
00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:44,323
Come on.

42
00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:59,939
Lola?

43
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,508
My King?

44
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,978
My apr?s-consummation
treat.

45
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,113
On it, sire.

46
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:33,205
Pantry's almost empty.

47
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:36,475
We'll need
another volunteer.

48
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:38,544
You should add that
to your "to do" list.

49
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:42,915
Ahh.

50
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:57,096
Lola, pet?

51
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:59,932
I do believe I'm ravenous.

52
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:17,216
<i>...And a weakling.</i>

53
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:19,551
<i>No.</i>

54
00:03:19,553 --> 00:03:21,654
<i>Oh, Richard,</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

55
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:24,556
<i>I'm sorry, but -- but you --</i>
<i>you are our last hope.</i>

56
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:26,358
<i>If you don't</i>
<i>help us...</i>

57
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,560
<i>...Victor Laszlo</i>
<i>will die in Casablanca.</i>

58
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:30,663
<i>What of it?</i>
<i>I'm gonna die in Casablanca.</i>

59
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:33,165
It's a good spot <i>for it.</i>

60
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:39,838
<i>Now if you --</i>

63
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,373
My name is Aldo.

64
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,609
My intel is
for Abaddon...

65
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,943
Minion.

66
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,079
And she appreciates
the work you've been doing.

67
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,781
At great peril.

68
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,216
But she is tied up
securing her place

69
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,218
as new leader
of the Kingdom.

70
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,788
She assures you that
all relevant information

71
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,123
can be conveyed to me.

72
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,859
So...Update?

73
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,435
The King
is off his game.

74
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,737
Except for sex,
pizza,

75
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,539
and human blood,
he has no interests.

76
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,407
He can't function
without me.

77
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,875
Well played.

78
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,410
I should mention
he keeps getting phone calls

79
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,978
from
those Winchesters.

80
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:45,416
They leave
voicemails for him.

81
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,551
Saying?

82
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,985
Mostly, they're rude.

83
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,321
One mentioned something
called the First Blade.

84
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:55,193
Interesting.

85
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,962
Follow how this develops
and report in.

86
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,697
Oh, I will.

87
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,965
And when I do,

88
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,735
I expect to report directly
to the next Queen of Hell.

89
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,903
Capiche?

90
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:33,030
All right, do it.

91
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,171
Daemon, esto subiecto
<i>voluntati meae.</i>

92
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:48,346
Winchesters.

93
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:54,152
I-is that, uh...?

94
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,953
Well,
that explains a lot.

95
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:59,123
Okay, uh, look...
Snooki --

96
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,125
can I call you
"Snooki"?

97
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,161
No.
It's Nicole now.

98
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,330
Okay, then.
Nicole...

99
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,332
We can do this
one of two ways.

100
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,536
The easy way --
you talk.

101
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,739
Or...
The easier way --

102
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,407
you still talk.

103
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,909
I vote for number two.

104
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,812
We just want some basic
information on Crowley. That's it.

105
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,814
Google him. Are we done?

106
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,919
Whoa! Not the face!
Are you crazy?

107
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,754
Listen, guys, what happens
in Hell stays in Hell.

108
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,189
I got nothin'.

109
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,559
But you do have a pretty sweet
deal with Crowley in charge.

110
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,028
If Abaddon wins,
you can kiss all that goodbye --

111
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,297
all the fancy cars,
the book deals.

112
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,698
Show biz can be tough.

113
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,233
I'm doing fine.
Thanks.

114
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,868
Oh. Well, good luck

115
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,937
landing your next gig
inside a Devil's Trap.

116
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,572
What do you
want to know?

117
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,106
Where is Crowley?

118
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,310
Last time I heard, he was somewhere
in the western Pacific.

119
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,746
Makes sense.
Really?

120
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,816
Floating around in the ocean while
his kingdom goes up in flames?

121
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,284
Meaning?

122
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,519
Hell's gettin' crazy.

123
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,955
Even the loyalists
want to sign on with Abaddon.

124
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,556
She's gonna make
her move.

125
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:10,728
Are we done?
I got a thing.

126
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:16,067
<i>Exorcizamus te,</i>

127
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,835
omnis immundus <i>spiritus...</i>

128
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,470
Seriously?
An exorcism?

129
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,706
We had a deal!
See ya, Snooks.

130
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,048
Honey, I'm home.

131
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,651
Hello, pumpkin.

132
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,287
Did you have
a nice day?

133
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,290
Lola did some shopping.

134
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,793
Looks like Lola did
a lot of shopping.

135
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,062
But not all of it's
for me.

136
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,398
Looky, looky.

137
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,605
I hope
it's a good vintage.

138
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,308
Well, you look like you
could use a little pick-me-up.

139
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,177
I just love
what it does for you.

140
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,382
Do you?

141
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,350
Unh!

142
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,059
You tried
to play <i>me?</i>

143
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,627
<i>I</i> play the tune!

144
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,829
Everyone else
dances to it.

145
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,964
Got it?

146
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,400
Yes!
I -- I'm your slave.

147
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,968
You're my rodent --

148
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,270
my little rodent
who went scurrying off

149
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,306
to Abaddon
to rat on me.

150
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,574
No! No.

151
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,843
Do you really think
some other lowlife

152
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,512
wouldn't sell you out?

153
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,181
I thought
you were a smart girl --

154
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,351
a girl I could've helped.

155
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,022
You're joking, right?

156
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,727
<i>You</i> help <i>me?</i>

157
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,231
Look at yourself.

158
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,568
You couldn't help anyone.

159
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,946
? But I'm

160
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,848
Hmm.

161
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,186
? Gonna try for the kingdom

162
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:20,758
? if I can, 'cause it makes
me feel like I'm a man ?

163
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,261
? when I put a spike
into my vein ?

164
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,698
? and I'll tell ya,
things aren't quite the same ?

165
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,102
? when I'm rushing on my run

166
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,038
? and I feel
just like Jesus' son ?

167
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,708
? and I guess
that I just don't know ?

168
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,778
? and I guess
that I just don't know ?

169
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:01,993
Hey.

170
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:04,829
So...Cain said
the First Blade was tossed

171
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:06,865
in the deepest ocean,
right?

172
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:09,033
That's the Mariana Trench.

173
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:12,637
Maybe Crowley found it,
and it's a double-cross.

174
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:15,507
That doesn't make sense.

175
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:18,209
He wants me to power it up and
kill the ginger. He set it up.

176
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:22,814
Okay. A-assuming
he does show up with it,

177
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:25,817
Crowley is only useful to us
until we have the Blade.

178
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:29,254
Yeah. So?

179
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:31,122
So...

180
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:35,827
There's nothing stopping us
from using it on him, right?

181
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,531
Nothing at all.

182
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:46,905
Speak of the devil.

183
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:50,208
Did you find
the First Blade?

184
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,510
Not exactly.

185
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:55,180
Well, then, what,
exactly?

186
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,252
I'm in...
a jam of sorts.

187
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:04,856
Thought you might help.

188
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,474
Hello, boys.

189
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,579
And what
do you call this?

190
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:29,480
Refreshments?

191
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:32,317
What's in the bag, Crowley?
Nothing.

192
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:33,718
Really?
Maybe I can, uh...

193
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:42,293
What, are you knocking over
blood banks?

194
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,634
Come on, guys.

195
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:56,107
Look at you.
You're a mess.

196
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:58,176
You know, we were counting
on you. You let us down.

197
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:00,144
Your slimy followers were
counting on you to kill Abaddon,

198
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:02,213
and you let <i>them</i> down.

199
00:12:02,215 --> 00:12:04,916
The man with all the mojo --
Captain Evil.

200
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,284
Oh, it's pathetic.

201
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:08,286
What is this?

202
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:09,888
An intervention?

203
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,657
You need to focus,
Crowley.

204
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:13,263
Get a grip!

205
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:14,889
What, you just gonna
let Hell go to Hell?

206
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:19,163
You don't know
what it's like to be human!

207
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:25,436
It's your DNA.

208
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:27,672
It's my addiction,

209
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:30,074
my cross, my burden!

210
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:31,442
All right,
take it easy.

211
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:34,145
I see the darkness of it now,
the Anthony Weiner of it.

212
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:35,647
It makes you needy.

213
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:38,483
I needed her.

214
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:41,185
Lola used me.

215
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:44,389
She reported everything I did
back to Abaddon.

216
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,826
Crowley...

217
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:51,529
Did you tell her
about the First Blade?

218
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:53,765
I don't know.

219
00:12:55,701 --> 00:13:00,171
Things get a trifle blurry
when I'm medicated.

220
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:01,506
Great.

221
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:05,176
If he told Lola,
she definitely told Abaddon.

222
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:07,445
Which means that Abaddon's
in the hunt for this thing, too.

223
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:09,847
All right, you know what?
This crap ends now.

224
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:12,483
You're cut off.
Okay?

225
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:15,119
Kicking it.
Cold turkey.

226
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:21,793
Back in this fetid pit.

227
00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:24,228
Could at least have added
some throw pillows.

228
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,898
Focus.

229
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,633
Okay.

230
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:31,002
You swept the Mariana Trench.
And...?

231
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:35,840
And the First Blade was not,
as hoped, in the Trench.

232
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:38,876
It had, in fact, been scooped up
by an unmanned sub,

233
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:41,312
from whom it was stolen
by a research assistant,

234
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:44,449
who reportedly sold it
to Portuguese smugglers who,

235
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:48,019
in turn, lost it to Moroccan
pirates in a poker game.

236
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:50,922
What?

237
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:52,390
Poor moose.

238
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:55,326
It's always a little tricky
keeping up, isn't it?

239
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:05,737
What are you doing?

240
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:11,709
I'm still a little tainted
by humanity.

241
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,679
Makes me sentimental.

242
00:14:16,015 --> 00:14:17,882
Well, stop.

243
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:22,420
You and I both know we shared
a mo back in that church.

244
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:24,655
And on some level,
we are bonded.

245
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:27,792
Crowley,
the only reason you are alive

246
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:30,795
is that we need your help
to deal with Abaddon

247
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:33,798
'cause she is an even worse
pile of crap than you are.

248
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
And that is the extent
of my concern for you.

249
00:14:35,802 --> 00:14:37,368
Got it?

250
00:14:38,737 --> 00:14:42,273
Okay. What happened
after the pirates?

251
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,319
What is Crowley doing?

252
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,024
Stealing candy.

253
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,726
He is -- he's --
he's stealing candy.

254
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,363
You know, at least
when Cass was human,

255
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:06,998
he was an okay guy.

256
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,934
Should've known Crowley
would be a douche version.

257
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:13,438
Hey. Hey!

258
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:16,474
Cut it out, man!

259
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:18,342
Image!

260
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:20,812
You're the king of rotten.
Act like it.

261
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:30,588
You really think
this guy's gonna show up?

262
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,056
I mean,
this isn't exactly a place

263
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:33,624
where million-dollar deals
go down.

264
00:15:33,626 --> 00:15:36,527
Look, word is,
this Andr? Develin character

265
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,029
bought the Blade
from the pirates,

266
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:39,497
and he's been
shopping it around.

267
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:41,332
That's all I know.

268
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:42,867
Hey, heads up.

269
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,440
Mr. Develin,
we spoke on the phone.

270
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,544
You said you represent
a serious collector

271
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:55,847
with an interest
in a private transaction.

272
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:57,115
Did he?

273
00:15:57,117 --> 00:15:58,783
Oh. Well, what he meant
to say was,

274
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:01,519
is that we are with...
The FBI.

275
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:02,587
Then good evening.

276
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:04,822
Wait a second.
We just want some answers.

277
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:09,393
Read Sartre.
Jean-Paul Sartre.

278
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:11,395
I'm merely
a facilitator

279
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:13,998
between the buyer
and the seller -- a conduit.

280
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:18,302
So, unless
I'm being detained --

281
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:37,588
So, am I?

282
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:40,925
Being detained?

283
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:43,895
Not at the...moment.

284
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,998
No, but we've got
our eyes on you.

285
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:58,009
National Institute
of Antiquities.

286
00:17:07,854 --> 00:17:09,520
Gin.

287
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:11,289
<i>Again.</i>

288
00:17:48,927 --> 00:17:51,662
Brought you guys something
for your shift.

289
00:17:58,136 --> 00:18:00,304
What's going on?

290
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:18,823
I don't have much
for you guys.

291
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:20,524
The guards
were good men.

292
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:23,427
They'd been here for years --
vetted, honest.

293
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:24,762
But...
But?

294
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:26,897
Security camera shows
a research assistant

295
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,866
caught them breaking into
vault number one.

296
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:30,901
That's her?

297
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,304
Gets weirder.

298
00:19:02,134 --> 00:19:03,601
Like I said.

299
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:05,636
Anything special about the
particular vault they opened?

300
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:08,439
Vault number one is where
they keep rare, new acquisitions

301
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:10,007
while they're
being examined.

302
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:12,076
So what
was stolen?

303
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:14,111
That's the kicker --
nothing.

304
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:15,913
The curator,
Dr. McElroy,

305
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,648
said the vault's
been empty for weeks.

306
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,550
Excuse me.
Detective?

307
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,688
Okay, so, just connecting
the dots here --

308
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,157
the Blade was likely put
in there when it first got here.

309
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,693
The guards were
obviously demons, so...

310
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:31,329
What? When the vault
turned out to be empty,

311
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:33,230
they killed
their guard meat-suits

312
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:35,333
and smoked out?
And reported back to who?

313
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:36,400
Abaddon?

314
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,272
She's closing in.

315
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:53,363
So, the First Blade
was never on display?

316
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:55,198
No authenticated item
by that name

317
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,699
was ever
on these premises.

318
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:58,868
"Authenticated."

319
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,070
Dr. McElroy,
this Blade was stolen

320
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:02,906
and smuggled
into the U.S.

321
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:05,375
In violation of treaties
with several governments.

322
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:07,677
We can compel you
to speak.

323
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,480
"Compel"?

324
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:12,849
And what might that
involve?

325
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:22,992
All right, look, I did acquire
the so-called First Blade.

326
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:26,062
And carbon dating did peg it
to biblical times,

327
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:28,898
but the authentication
proved unreliable.

328
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,466
So it <i>was</i> in the vault.

329
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:33,703
I removed it myself.

330
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:36,172
The guards didn't know.

331
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:37,473
And where is it now?

332
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:39,042
Several weeks ago,

333
00:20:39,044 --> 00:20:41,711
a confidential offer
was made to purchase it.

334
00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:44,314
I was afraid we would never
authenticate the thing, so --

335
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:45,648
Who was the buyer?

336
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,684
Sorry.

337
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:50,587
The buyer insisted on
absolute secrecy.

338
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:54,157
Well...federal statutes
trump your little deal.

339
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,327
So...the buyer?

340
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:59,829
And you'll get it out of me
one way or another,

341
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:01,497
won't you, Agent?

342
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:03,600
Hmm.

343
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:11,274
I never did know
his real identity.

344
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:13,710
He called himself
"Magnus."

345
00:21:13,712 --> 00:21:16,079
Don't ask me where he lives.
I have no idea.

346
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:18,181
But I do have
a meeting.

347
00:21:18,183 --> 00:21:22,452
So, here is my number,
should you need anything else.

348
00:21:31,762 --> 00:21:33,229
What?

349
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:38,735
Did you catch that?
"Magnus"?

350
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:40,203
"Albert Magnus"?

351
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:43,473
The name the Men of Letters used
when they want to be incognito?

352
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:46,075
Yeah, but we know that all of
the Men of Letters are dead.

353
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:48,344
Do we?

354
00:21:56,854 --> 00:21:59,088
Turndown service?

355
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,456
I'd like a mint on my pillow.

356
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,592
What do you know about the Men
of Letters massacre of 1958?

357
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:05,695
We know Abaddon missed our
grandfather and Larry Ganem.

358
00:22:05,697 --> 00:22:06,896
Was there anybody else?

359
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:10,099
Let me get this straight.

360
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:12,101
You keep me locked up
in this closet,

361
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:13,636
ignore my suffering,

362
00:22:13,638 --> 00:22:16,339
and then come barging in here
and demand my help?

363
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:19,175
More or less, yeah.

364
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:24,180
Did I or did I not keep my end
of the bargain the other night?

365
00:22:24,182 --> 00:22:26,783
Quite brilliantly, I might add.
We are partners!

366
00:22:26,785 --> 00:22:28,618
And you owe me!

367
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,953
"Owe" you?

368
00:22:29,955 --> 00:22:32,555
I wouldn't be in this mess
if it wasn't for you two.

369
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:35,692
You shoot me up.
You make me a junkie.

370
00:22:35,694 --> 00:22:37,593
You keep me stashed away
for months

371
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:39,228
while my kingdom falls apart?!

372
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:44,801
What do you want?

373
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:52,041
It's not a very good scotch,
is it?

374
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:55,845
Okay, Crowley, we have gone
through the records

375
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:58,214
for the entire membership
in 1958.

376
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:01,918
Every single name matches
the men who were killed.

377
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,120
That would be the active
membership, correct?

378
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:08,524
Were you two dropped
on your heads a great deal?

379
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:11,494
Like I told you,
rumor has it

380
00:23:11,496 --> 00:23:14,197
that a rogue member
was tossed out on his arse.

381
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:16,632
Does that
make him "active"?

382
00:23:16,634 --> 00:23:20,136
Seriously, boys, how did you
ever function without me?

383
00:23:26,777 --> 00:23:29,712
Well, hello,
Miss Ichigatsu.

384
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,686
"Infamati et obliterati."

385
00:23:36,688 --> 00:23:41,157
"Dishonored
and forgotten."

386
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:46,929
Wow.

387
00:23:46,931 --> 00:23:49,365
This guy was something.

388
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:55,004
Tough name.
Yeah, Cuthbert Sinclair.

389
00:23:55,006 --> 00:23:57,340
I'd have just gone
with "Magnus."

390
00:23:57,342 --> 00:23:59,542
Looks like he designed
most of the warding

391
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:00,710
that keeps the bunker safe.

392
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:03,079
Says here he was named
"Master of Spell",

393
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:04,380
right after he initiated.

394
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:07,417
I guess his work
got a little crazy.

395
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:10,353
The leadership called it
"eccentric" and "irresponsible""

396
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:12,822
good. So these are the projects
that he proposed

397
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:14,190
the last two years
he was here.

398
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:15,491
Look at this --
"rejected."

399
00:24:15,493 --> 00:24:18,127
"Rejected." "Rejected""

400
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:19,495
So difficult --

401
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:22,432
brilliant, ahead of your time,
despised for it.

402
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:24,167
Trust me, I know.

403
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:27,003
"Formal separation
from Men of Letters --

404
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:29,472
April 1956."

405
00:24:29,474 --> 00:24:31,240
He missed the massacre.

406
00:24:31,242 --> 00:24:35,411
I never knew his name,
but I heard someone was out.

407
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:37,346
Did my damndest
to find him.

408
00:24:37,348 --> 00:24:40,316
Thought he might be
my way inside this joint.

409
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:43,753
So where'd you look?

410
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:59,936
So this is where
your demons tracked him to?

411
00:24:59,938 --> 00:25:02,972
Exact spot.

412
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:05,141
My boys
never could find him.

413
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:08,544
I'm sensing nothing,
so if he's here,

414
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:10,847
he's warded up
to the gills.

415
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:13,282
Well, he was
a genius at it, right?

416
00:25:13,284 --> 00:25:16,953
Sure as hell ain't gonna be
found by a bunch of demons.

417
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:19,822
Oh, like he's gonna
open his heart to you lot,

418
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,657
because
you're such prizes?

419
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:24,460
Better --
we're legacies.

420
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:32,735
All right, if he's so bent
on hiding, maybe he's watching.

421
00:25:32,737 --> 00:25:34,670
Give it a shot.

422
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:42,278
Cuthbert Sinclair --
uh, Magnus -- whatever.

423
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,983
We're Sam and Dean Winchester,
Henry Winchester's grandsons.

424
00:25:46,985 --> 00:25:51,320
And Men of Letters,
ourselves.

425
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:53,956
We know what happened
back in the day.

426
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:57,860
We don't necessarily agree
with it.

427
00:25:57,862 --> 00:26:00,196
We figured...

428
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:03,699
Maybe you want to tell
your side of the story.

429
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:32,428
Which way?

430
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:06,162
<i>Bravo!</i>

431
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:08,264
<i>Well done.</i>

432
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:13,869
Sorry about
all the theatricality.

433
00:27:13,871 --> 00:27:15,905
I just wanted to see
what you two were made of.

434
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:18,708
So, what,
are we underground?

435
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,909
No.

436
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:22,845
No, my fortress is right where
you were standing.

437
00:27:22,847 --> 00:27:24,747
But it's invisible.

438
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:27,917
Then you must be
Cuthbert Sinclair.

439
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,619
Ugh.

440
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:34,423
I haven't gone by that moniker
in, oh...57 years now.

441
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:37,059
Well, you're looking good
for a guy pushing...90?

442
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:38,861
Well, thanks, sport.

443
00:27:38,863 --> 00:27:41,230
There's a spell
for damn near everything.

444
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:42,265
I am impressed, though.

445
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:44,734
You did exactly
what you should've done.

446
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:47,670
Though I am gonna miss
those two from my zoo.

447
00:27:47,672 --> 00:27:49,538
Your zoo?

448
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,010
Oh, gentlemen,
you are in the midst

449
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:55,444
of the greatest collection

450
00:27:55,446 --> 00:27:58,514
of supernatural rarities
and antiquities on the planet.

451
00:27:58,516 --> 00:27:59,682
I'm sorry.

452
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:02,385
Did you say
that you were Men of Letters?

453
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:05,254
I thought that whole thing
died out after '58.

454
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:07,356
Well, we are --
we are legacies.

455
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:09,625
But actually, uh...

456
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:10,793
We're hunters.

457
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:15,731
Hunters?

458
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:17,433
Wow!

459
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:18,768
Hunters.

460
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,102
With the key
to the kingdom!

461
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:22,371
The boys must be spinning
in their graves.

462
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:24,006
Damn snobs.

463
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:25,875
Bunch of librarians,
if you ask me.

464
00:28:25,877 --> 00:28:28,778
Although I was
always fond of Henry.

465
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,080
I was his mentor,
you know?

466
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:34,517
Yeah, till the squares
gave me the boot.

467
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,718
Yeah.

468
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,621
'Course, he came here
to visit me, in secret.

469
00:28:38,623 --> 00:28:40,690
Called out to me,
same as you did.

470
00:28:40,692 --> 00:28:42,425
Oh, yes.

471
00:28:42,427 --> 00:28:45,061
Quite the wild hair,
your grandfather was.

472
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:48,698
Listen, Magnus, uh...

473
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,334
We got ourselves
a little situation.

474
00:28:51,336 --> 00:28:54,704
Abaddon,
the last Knight of Hell,

475
00:28:54,706 --> 00:28:57,239
is looking to up her pay grade
and take over the place.

476
00:28:57,241 --> 00:28:59,642
Things never change,
do they?

477
00:28:59,644 --> 00:29:02,978
I kept telling the boys
over and over again --

478
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,614
I would say,
"we could stop all this.

479
00:29:05,616 --> 00:29:07,483
"We could rid the world
of monsters

480
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:09,685
once and for all
if we just put our minds to it",

481
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:11,120
but,
"oh, no," they said.

482
00:29:11,122 --> 00:29:12,988
"No, no, no.
It's not our place.

483
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,291
We're here to study.
We're here to catalog""

484
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:17,860
yeah, yeah, no, we get it.
They're, uh...geeks.

485
00:29:17,862 --> 00:29:18,928
Mm.

486
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,563
But she can be stopped.

487
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:24,233
But we need something
that we hear you have --

488
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:26,035
the First Blade.

489
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:33,642
Hmm. I see.

490
00:29:33,644 --> 00:29:36,212
Interesting.

491
00:29:36,214 --> 00:29:38,614
But if you'd really
done your homework,

492
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:41,217
you would know
that it's absolutely useless,

493
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:42,952
unless, of course,
you're possessing the Mark --

494
00:29:42,954 --> 00:29:45,421
the Mark of Cain.

495
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:50,993
Oh, my.

496
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:53,763
How did you come by that?

497
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:56,065
Listen,
if Abaddon takes over,

498
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:58,801
the one thing she wants
more than anything

499
00:29:58,803 --> 00:30:00,403
is to make hell on earth.

500
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:02,138
Not even you
can escape that.

501
00:30:03,574 --> 00:30:06,976
And they say
all hunters are morons.

502
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:09,945
It's right there behind you,
gentlemen.

503
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,287
Listen, if you're serious
about taking action,

504
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:20,256
this --
this is taking action.

505
00:30:20,258 --> 00:30:22,958
You loan us that Blade,
and we will stop the bitch.

506
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,462
Hmm.
Let me think about it.

507
00:30:26,464 --> 00:30:28,798
All right,
I've thought about it.

508
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,667
<i>Abi, ab oculis meis!</i>

509
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,598
Magnus has Dean.

510
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,099
What did you do
with my brother?

511
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,968
Don't worry.
He's fine.

512
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,737
But I did what any
good collector would do --

513
00:30:56,739 --> 00:31:00,074
I separated the ordinary
from the extraordinary.

514
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:02,009
I had the First Blade.

515
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:05,179
And now I have the Mark of Cain
to complete the set.

516
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:07,148
Yeah, well, problem is,
it's attached.

517
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,616
So how about
you loan me the Blade

518
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:09,917
and I take care
of business?

519
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,753
Dean, I am offering you
the moon here --

520
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:16,090
to be part of the greatest
collection of all time,

521
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:19,427
to be young forever.

522
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:23,164
Let me teach you
my secrets. Hmm?

523
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,932
Be my companion.

524
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:27,001
I have to be honest
with you,

525
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:29,437
it has gotten lonely here
over the years.

526
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:31,572
When you were
saying any of that,

527
00:31:31,574 --> 00:31:33,541
did it feel
at all creepy?

528
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,143
Yeah.

529
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,478
I'm just gonna
grab the Blade and go.

530
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,947
One little design flaw
to the place --

531
00:31:39,949 --> 00:31:41,649
no windows, no doors.

532
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,721
Well, in that case...

533
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:49,023
I'll just make my own.
<i>Shen ti r?n shao!</i>

534
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:50,625
Hey.

535
00:31:50,627 --> 00:31:52,026
Aah!
Eh?

536
00:31:52,028 --> 00:31:54,228
Tricky little spell,
that first one, right?

537
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,696
Chinese. Ah.

538
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:58,666
Cheap magician's trick on
that one -- picked your pocket.

539
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:01,202
Nice gun.

540
00:32:01,204 --> 00:32:03,905
Welcome
to the collection, Dean.

541
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,417
You mind?

542
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:21,756
Who would have thunk it,
eh, moose --

543
00:32:21,758 --> 00:32:25,359
you and me, same team,
in the trenches.

544
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:28,496
When this is over,
we can get matching tattoos.

545
00:32:28,498 --> 00:32:30,431
Just to be clear, Crowley,

546
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:32,099
we are not
on the same anything.

547
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:35,303
By the way,
since the place is warded,

548
00:32:35,305 --> 00:32:38,506
your powers are useless,
which means you are useless,

549
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:39,840
even more so than usual.

550
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:43,511
You're gonna need another set
of hands when you get in there,

551
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:46,547
unless you have
other volunteers in mind.

552
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,916
Thanks. Pass.

553
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:52,053
If memory serves me,

554
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:55,222
I'm the one
who helped your brother

555
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:58,659
find Cain so that we could
find the Blade,

556
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:01,562
so that Dean
could receive the Mark.

557
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:04,131
I'm the one who flushed

558
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:07,301
that lout Gadreel
out of your noggin.

559
00:33:07,303 --> 00:33:12,273
So, lately, big boy, I've seen
mo playing time than you.

560
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:16,243
Crowley, will you please
shut the hell up?

561
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:22,883
Oh, you're a really sorry
piece of work. You know that?

562
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:24,885
Holed up in here,
doing nothing.

563
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:27,088
You bitch
about the Men of Letters.

564
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,024
You're way worse.

565
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:32,093
Should we fire it up?

566
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,227
What do you say?

567
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:34,729
Go to hell.

568
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:36,197
Oh, come on, Dean.

569
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:38,399
This is the object
of your quest.

570
00:33:38,401 --> 00:33:42,303
Tell me
Henry Winchester's grandson

571
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:44,972
isn't curious
to see if it works.

572
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,842
Give me your hand.

573
00:33:47,844 --> 00:33:51,612
Give me...your hand.

574
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,714
That's it.

575
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,601
Good.

576
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:19,807
Next time,
it'll be easier.

577
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:24,211
You'll get used to the feelings,
even welcome them.

578
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:28,249
Here's something.

579
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:31,052
Apparently,
he wanted to make the entire

580
00:34:31,054 --> 00:34:32,420
Men of Letters bunker
invisible.

581
00:34:32,422 --> 00:34:34,755
All physical points of entry
were to be eliminated,

582
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:37,692
"and entrance
would only be gained...

583
00:34:37,694 --> 00:34:40,227
By spell."

584
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:43,798
Oh.

585
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,566
We're gonna need
some things.

586
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:48,069
You actually might turn out
to be useful, Crowley.

587
00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:51,839
You'll come to understand,
Dean -- nothing can stop us.

588
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:57,845
Anything, anyone we want
to own or destroy is ours.

589
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,916
Well,
how about this, Magnus?

590
00:35:01,918 --> 00:35:04,085
How about I take a knee?

591
00:35:04,087 --> 00:35:06,253
Then what are you
gonna do?

592
00:35:06,255 --> 00:35:08,489
Huh? You gonna kill me?

593
00:35:08,491 --> 00:35:10,224
'Cause without this thing
on my arm,

594
00:35:10,226 --> 00:35:13,494
that Blade's nothing
but a hunk of bone with teeth.

595
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:15,329
Hmm.

596
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:19,300
Well, I'm not asking you
for your cooperation.

597
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:21,168
I'm just taking it.

598
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:26,774
<i>Mentem tuam</i>
<i>ac voluntatem adsumo.</i>

599
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:33,581
Interesting effect, huh?

600
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:36,383
All thought,
all will just...

601
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,785
Drained out of you.

602
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:40,321
I do this enough,

603
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:45,392
you'll be ready
for whatever I have in mind.

604
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:51,565
I did good, eh, moose?

605
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,534
Everything on the list.

606
00:35:56,772 --> 00:35:58,506
You're welcome.

607
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:03,844
Remember --
stay close, do what I say,

608
00:36:03,846 --> 00:36:05,746
and shut the hell up.

609
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:08,015
I'm growing on you,
aren't I?

610
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:14,955
<i>Ingressum domi</i>
<i>dona mihi.</i>

611
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,941
Love what he's done
with the place.

612
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:05,206
Take me to my brother.

613
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:10,377
Sam! No!

614
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:16,784
Unh!

615
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:23,157
Shape-shifter.

616
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:27,528
You see? There are benefits
to keeping a zoo.

617
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:42,009
You know, I discarded you
far too quickly, Sam.

618
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:44,345
You're way more valuable
than I thought you were.

619
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:47,414
Why would I knock myself out
trying to sap your will?

620
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:51,385
I think Sam here will get you
to see things my way.

621
00:37:51,387 --> 00:37:52,987
Magnus,
I swear to God...

622
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:54,154
What?

623
00:37:54,156 --> 00:37:56,023
What are you gonna do?
What is he gonna do?

624
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:58,459
Huh?

625
00:37:58,461 --> 00:38:01,161
Unh!

626
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:03,931
Yeah, look, look, Sam,
I'm not gonna kill you.

627
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:05,633
Of course not.

628
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:09,570
But I am gonna make you suffer
unimaginably, all right?

629
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:32,559
Dean?

630
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,802
Dean.

631
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:47,207
Hey, it's over.

632
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:50,110
He's dead.

633
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,481
Drop the Blade, Dean.

634
00:38:56,985 --> 00:38:57,985
Dean!

635
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:03,791
Drop the Blade.

636
00:39:21,546 --> 00:39:22,913
Brilliant, I must say.

637
00:39:22,915 --> 00:39:24,615
I'm speaking
of myself, of course.

638
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:26,650
All you two managed
to do was get trussed up.

639
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:29,487
Combine a little derring-do
on my part,

640
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:32,022
a little dumb muscle
from squirrel,

641
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:34,024
a little bleeding from moose...

642
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:36,660
Happy ending.
Roll credits.

643
00:39:36,662 --> 00:39:38,429
No, no!

644
00:39:38,431 --> 00:39:39,897
Come on.

645
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:41,565
What the hell?

646
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:43,234
That's sulfur --
demons.

647
00:39:44,704 --> 00:39:46,137
Abaddon's.

648
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:48,105
Well, she's just
one jump behind us.

649
00:39:48,107 --> 00:39:50,174
Guess she couldn't find
Magnus' joint, either.

650
00:39:50,176 --> 00:39:51,842
What about the trunk?
Safe.

651
00:39:51,844 --> 00:39:53,744
Warding kept them out.

652
00:39:55,514 --> 00:39:57,314
Demon mitts
all over my baby.

653
00:39:57,316 --> 00:39:59,517
Oh, come on!

654
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:02,820
Oh, now
they're keying cars?!

655
00:40:06,124 --> 00:40:08,058
What language is that?

656
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,360
It's Enochian.

657
00:40:09,362 --> 00:40:11,729
The message isn't for you.

658
00:40:11,731 --> 00:40:14,198
It's for me.

659
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,433
"Be afraid. Your Queen."

660
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:18,402
Abaddon's
getting more brazen.

661
00:40:18,404 --> 00:40:20,237
She thinks
I'm losing my grip.

662
00:40:23,775 --> 00:40:25,543
Dean.

663
00:40:26,478 --> 00:40:28,345
Dean.

664
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:33,150
Listen, you said
Crowley was only useful

665
00:40:33,152 --> 00:40:34,919
till we got the Blade.

666
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:37,054
We got the Blade.

667
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:48,032
You know, boys,
I'm in debt to you.

668
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:50,334
You forced sobriety
on me,

669
00:40:50,336 --> 00:40:54,505
and now I can see the situation
for what it is.

670
00:40:54,507 --> 00:40:57,508
Dean, you are quite
the killing machine.

671
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,677
And it occurs to me
that Abaddon

672
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,712
is not the only name
on your list.

673
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:04,582
My name must be up there,
as well.

674
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:13,224
It's no good
to you without me.

675
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:17,795
Yes, but as long as I have it,
it's no good to you.

676
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:19,763
Now, this is the way
it's going to go --

677
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:21,999
I'll hang on
to old donkey teeth here

678
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:24,268
until such time
as you locate Abaddon.

679
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:28,305
Then you'll destroy her.

680
00:41:28,307 --> 00:41:30,207
You're right, moose.

681
00:41:30,209 --> 00:41:32,376
You can't trust me.

682
00:41:32,378 --> 00:41:36,313
But, sadly,
I can't trust you, either.
