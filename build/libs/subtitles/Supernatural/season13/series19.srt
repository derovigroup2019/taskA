1
00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:04,227
Castiel, our numbers
were greatly diminished

2
00:00:04,229 --> 00:00:05,762
after the fall.

3
00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:08,264
No one's made new angels
since the dawn of creation.

4
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:09,799
We're going extinct.

5
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,969
You did well, Dumah.
You delivered him as promised.

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,904
We hear you have influence
with the nephilim.

7
00:00:14,906 --> 00:00:16,906
No, I will not help you.

8
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:18,875
Ever the renegade.

9
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:21,878
But you just let
the deadliest witch in the world

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,646
walk away with a page
from this book.

11
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:26,983
But if she's right and if
she <i>does</i> see Lucifer again,

12
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,484
I hope she makes him suffer.

13
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,853
And if Rowena breaks bad,
I will hunt her down myself

14
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:33,256
and put a bullet in her.
One needle stops the heart,

15
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:34,169
the other one starts it up again.

16
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:35,926
Dean, you're talking
about killing yourself.

17
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:38,394
- Yeah, well, it worked before.
- That's an insane risk to take.

18
00:00:38,396 --> 00:00:40,596
Dean! Hey.

19
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:42,265
Hello. My name is Jessica.

20
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:44,867
I'm a reaper, and I'm here
to lead you to your next life.

21
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:46,436
Hey, Dean.

22
00:00:46,438 --> 00:00:48,971
Billie.
No, I saw Cass kill you.

23
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:51,741
Kill one incarnation of Death,
like you did,

24
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:55,712
the next reaper to die
takes his place.

25
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:57,780
So you died to become Death?

26
00:00:57,782 --> 00:00:59,449
I've come to claim what's mine.

27
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:02,919
Aah!

28
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:06,255
Gabriel! What are you doin',
son? I <i>broke</i> you!

29
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:15,598
Welcome to the team.

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm not really a team guy.
I'm gonna bounce.

31
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:20,770
No, Gabriel, please.

32
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:35,218
Hello, boys.

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,354
I'm very sure I've done nothing
that you know of

34
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:41,491
to make you want to call,
but how lovely to hear from you.

35
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:44,026
Rowena, that's...
that's not... We, um...

36
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:45,828
<i>You'll have to speak up.</i>

37
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,164
We need your help.
<i>Really?</i>

38
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,100
<i>We must assemble</i>
<i>our most powerful allies</i>

39
00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:52,668
<i>to rescue our family</i>

40
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,604
and confront
the archangel Michael.

41
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:57,507
Now he's in
an alternate universe, so...

42
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,910
<i>Oh! The handsome angel</i>
<i>is there, isn't he?</i>

43
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,712
Hello, Tweetie Pie.

44
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:04,814
Um...hello.

45
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:06,282
<i>Lads...</i>

46
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:09,352
obviously, I'd love to help,
after what you...

47
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:11,687
oh, <i>Sam</i> did for me,

48
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:13,923
<i>but I'm in the damp</i>
<i>Pacific Northwest right now,</i>

49
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,459
<i>working on</i>
<i>my own little project.</i>

50
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:18,060
Project?
What project?

51
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,263
<i>Oh, nothing for you</i>
<i>to worry about.</i>

52
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,699
Just checking a few items off
my little “to do” list.

53
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,468
Sure, that didn't sound
ominous.

54
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,670
Rowena, are you at a...
party or something?

55
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:30,273
I am, but I'm surprised you
recognize the sounds of a party,

56
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,341
seeing as how you're all work
and no play.

57
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:35,077
Look, we didn't call
to talk, we...

58
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,313
The world
is in danger, Rowena.

59
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:39,448
And I'm currently surrounded by
art that makes me think

60
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,184
the world <i>should</i> be in danger.

61
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:44,253
Best of luck to you, boys,
my three little musketeers.

62
00:02:44,255 --> 00:02:47,323
Mwah.

63
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,225
Damn it.

64
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,728
You know, she's right.

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,463
You never go to parties.

66
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:03,573
Good afternoon.

67
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:05,741
Hello.

68
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:08,077
You're Elizabeth Mahler,
aren't you?

69
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,779
Yes. Do I know you?

70
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:11,848
No, but I know you.

71
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,616
I saw you in
the newspaper, didn't I?

72
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,751
In “The Oregon Tribune”"

73
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:18,554
There's no need to bring up
any of that unpleasantness.

74
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:21,791
Of course not.
My humblest apologies.

75
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,297
Bernard, this is my song!

76
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:31,901
Be a darling, will you?

77
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:35,271
Glad <i>you</i>
could make it, too.

78
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:04,634
- Oh!
- Ah!

79
00:04:04,636 --> 00:04:07,270
<i>Mors lumine.</i>

You know what? Forget Rowena.

83
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:30,293
There's gotta be some other way
we can track down Gabriel

84
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:31,794
and hijack his grace.

85
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:33,438
Even though he could be
any place on Earth?

86
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:34,731
Yes.

87
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:38,401
Or technically, anywhere
in the entire universe.

88
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,902
I didn't say it was
gonna be easy, but, uh...

89
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,371
All right, come on.

90
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,475
Ideas, come on. Here we go.

91
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,024
Nah.

92
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:04,660
I need a real drink. I'm gonna
get a beer. You want a beer?

93
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:06,395
No.
I'll get beer.

94
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,201
The angels.

95
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:13,703
What?

96
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:15,404
Maybe Heaven could help us.

97
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:16,806
Uh, not for nothing,

98
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:18,407
but don't the angels
mostly wanna kill you?

99
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:21,777
Yes. Yeah. This would be
something of a Hail Mary.

100
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,313
Hmm.

101
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:26,449
It's a sports term.

102
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,385
Like slam dunk or, uh...

103
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:30,987
ball handler.

104
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,558
That's, uh...Mnh-mnh.

105
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,493
I don't think
it's a good idea.

106
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:40,429
Well, Dean, we don't have
any good ideas.

107
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:42,231
Okay, let's just -- let's just
not barrel through with that

108
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:44,433
like, uh, you know,
like the Donatello thing.

109
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:47,403
We had our disagreement,
but we got results.

110
00:05:47,405 --> 00:05:49,905
That didn't make it okay.
I hear your concerns.

111
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:51,574
And yes, the angels,
they loathe me,

112
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:53,042
and there's going
to be dangers,

113
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:54,877
but Heaven doesn't want
the world to end

114
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,613
any more than we do.

115
00:05:57,615 --> 00:06:01,150
This is -- this is something
that I have to try.

116
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,585
We got a problem.

117
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:04,420
Another one? Awesome.

118
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:07,656
All the stuff Rowena said
on the phone --

119
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,392
uh, Pacific Northwest,
art gallery, party --

120
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:11,360
I-I think I found her.

121
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:13,896
A rich lady exploded?
Yeah.

122
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:15,798
Local cops are -- are calling it
spontaneous combustion,

123
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,567
but...pretty much.

124
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:20,302
Well, that does sound
like Rowena.

125
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:22,104
I knew it.
I freaking knew it, man.

126
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:24,240
You gave her that page. What'd
you think was gonna happen, huh?

127
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:26,776
She wanted to protect herself.
Yeah, by barbecuing someone?

128
00:06:26,778 --> 00:06:29,712
We don't know what this is yet.
Maybe she had a reason to --

129
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:32,148
Doesn't matter what the reason
is. That's not okay.

130
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,384
Okay, I said if Rowena goes bad
again, I'll deal with it,

131
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:38,287
so I'll deal with it.
You better.

132
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:44,060
Cass, you wanna try this
angel thing, then go for it.

133
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:48,998
Just don't get dead again.

134
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,518
Hello?
Shh!

135
00:07:15,693 --> 00:07:17,693
Indra?

136
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:19,929
Castiel.

137
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:21,797
Nice blade.

138
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:26,235
Uh...
are we gonna fight?

139
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,038
No. No, I don't --
I don't want to.

140
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,507
I...

141
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,509
I just need
to get into Heaven.

142
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:35,511
Okay.

143
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:37,646
Who's stopping you?

144
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:41,417
This isn't exactly
the welcome I was expecting.

145
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,018
Yeah, well,
we're all learning

146
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,955
how to deal with
disappointment lately.

147
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:48,524
Look, I could, uh...

148
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:50,759
get it together to, uh...

149
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,563
battle, if you want.

150
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:56,799
I mean, none of the angels
are exactly thrilled

151
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:59,902
with your, uh,
“ongoing adventures.”

152
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:04,273
But personally? Meh.

153
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,976
Is that a...

154
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:08,410
Are you drunk?

155
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:10,579
Well, not yet, but if I keep
drinking at a pace,

156
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:13,315
it starts to at least
take the edge off.

157
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:16,519
Indra, this is an important
responsibility.

158
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,354
You're guarding
the gates of Heaven.

159
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:21,157
Oh, you think it's an important
responsibility?

160
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,725
You?

161
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:26,996
Indra.
Hey, hey,

162
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:28,631
between us,

163
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,432
if you wanna just...

164
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:34,570
say we fought
and angel blade me right now,

165
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:36,805
that'll be okay.

166
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:40,509
Is that a joke?

167
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:43,279
Is it?

168
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:46,615
Indra, what's wrong?

169
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:51,787
See for yourself.

170
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:07,403
And for what it's worth,

171
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:08,871
good luck.

172
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:19,181
Hello?

173
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:22,051
Hello?

174
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:25,654
Hello?

175
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:39,735
Dumah.

176
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:44,039
I need to talk to you.

177
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,310
I...

178
00:09:48,312 --> 00:09:50,145
I know you want
to murder me,

179
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:51,847
and I know that you have

180
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:54,550
good reason to want
to murder me.

181
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:59,054
But there are events
unfolding on Earth,

182
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,057
and, um...

183
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,760
well...

184
00:10:04,762 --> 00:10:08,797
the archangel Gabriel,
he's alive.

185
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,168
And I need to find him
before Michael, who's...

186
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,470
It's not our Michael.

187
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:18,440
It's another
much, much <i>worse</i> Michael.

188
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:22,044
I need to find him
before <i>that</i> Michael

189
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:24,546
invades this world to...

190
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:26,882
to either subjugate
or destroy it.

191
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:28,917
Or both,
probably in that order.

192
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:40,629
And there's
also the problem of...

193
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:44,066
of a missing nephilim
and Lucifer.

194
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:47,036
He's back, too. It's...

195
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:49,571
it's been
an eventful few weeks.

196
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:54,910
I realize that this may be
a long shot, but...

197
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:01,550
What is that?

198
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,754
Castiel, I think...

199
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:11,126
I think that maybe
we could help each other.

200
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:21,503
Still no answer?
Yeah.

201
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:24,039
Still no answer.

202
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,542
You know I don't wanna be
right about this, but...

203
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,610
I mean, look, I want
the fun, flirty Rowena

204
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:30,879
that mostly helps us.

205
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:34,249
But you gotta be ready
for, uh...not that.

206
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:37,519
Or maybe she just has bad
cell reception.

207
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:52,034
What the hell?!

208
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:53,469
Who are you?!

209
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,937
Hi, Dean.

210
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:57,639
Wait...Jessica.

211
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:00,342
So you know her?
Yeah, she's a reaper.

212
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:02,911
She tried to take me
into the light.

213
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:04,947
Didn't work out.
It really didn't.

214
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:07,516
And honestly, it's been a little
sad watching you go this long

215
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,585
without telling Sam about me.

216
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:12,855
Wait. Hold on a second.

217
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,690
What do you mean “watching”?

218
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,025
Well, after Dean's little trip
to the Veil,

219
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,162
Death asked me to keep an eye
on your two, in case.

220
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:22,931
In case of what?
This, I guess.

221
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:25,467
I don't ask Death questions.
Never goes well.

222
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:28,036
So what, you --
you've just been...

223
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,440
hovering around us, invisible,
like a -- like a babysitter?

224
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:34,877
No, no, more like
a baby monitor.

225
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:40,582
- And -- and you've seen, um...
- Oh, everything.

226
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:43,452
You mean, like,
<i>everything</i> everything?

227
00:12:43,454 --> 00:12:48,557
I'm especially fond
of Sam's impressive...

228
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,492
extensive array
of hair products.

229
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:56,365
Not to mention, the 3-day-old
bacon cheeseburger in your room,

230
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,434
or the VHS tape
hidden under your bed,

231
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:01,970
labeled, “Sweet Princess Asuka
Meets the Tentacles of Ple--”

232
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:04,273
Okay, all right, all right,
that's not cool, okay?

233
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,241
That's -- First of all,
that's a classic.

234
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,545
Secondly, the burger's
for emergency cases only.

235
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:13,015
Okay. Gross.

236
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:15,784
Now why are you
just manifesting now?

237
00:13:15,786 --> 00:13:17,219
People in Portland
have been dying

238
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:19,087
outside of
their assigned times,

239
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,522
because apparently someone

240
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:23,258
has become powerful enough
to do that.

241
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,860
Rowena?

242
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,797
So I've been instructed
to offer my assistance

243
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,899
as a resource.

244
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:32,901
Wait, you said
<i>people</i> are dying,

245
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:34,369
as in more than one.

246
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:36,538
Four, so far.

247
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:39,842
Yeah, okay, well, uh,
we're handling it.

248
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:43,045
But if you need anything --
We don't, and we won't.

249
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:45,747
Cool. Well, I'm around.

250
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:47,649
Always.

251
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,887
Okay.

252
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,356
Well, you know, we could've
actually used her help.

253
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:57,092
We could...Seriously?

254
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,229
You trust her?
No, I don't trust her.

255
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:04,433
But between the --
the reapers and Death,

256
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:07,402
the hell's this witch
got us into, huh?

257
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:19,081
I've become too sentimental.
That's the problem.

258
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,617
Whoever would've expected.

259
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:24,686
Oh, this won't be fun, Bernard.

260
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:27,389
The Winchesters keep calling
and they won't just give up.

261
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:29,057
They'll come here.

262
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:33,695
But we won't let anyone
stop me from fixing things.

263
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:36,131
I'm capable of anything now.

264
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:42,404
Anything.

265
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,159
Uh, the victim's name
was Elizabeth Mahler.

266
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:08,894
I'm in her e-mails
right now.

267
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:10,629
Anything look like
Rowena bait?

268
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:12,431
Hard to say. Um...

269
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:15,567
so Mahler was the CFO of
a local pharmaceutical company.

270
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:17,269
Getting a lot of traction
on the lo--

271
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:18,737
Oh, wow.

272
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:20,839
What?

273
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:23,008
Look at this.
Pirodine Pharmaceuticals.

274
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,510
According to this article,
they sold

275
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:26,678
thousands of
improperly labeled drugs.

276
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,281
So what? People got sick?

277
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:31,517
People died. Uh...

278
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,853
Wow. Mahler's lawyer got her off
on a technicality.

279
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:38,190
Okay. So, what? You think she deserved it?

280
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:40,592
No, I'm done defending Rowena, okay?

281
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:42,661
I'm -- I'm just reading
what's there.

282
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:44,096
Come on.

283
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:49,768
Okay, I have a question.

284
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,437
If that's Elizabeth Mahler,

285
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:53,906
who the hell is that?
I don't know.

286
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:56,341
Articles only mentioned
one person.

287
00:15:57,444 --> 00:15:59,344
Wait a second.

288
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:02,080
I've seen something
like that before.

289
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:08,887
No way.

290
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,191
That is what's left
of a reaper.

291
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,704
I have an idea. Come on.

292
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:33,679
What?

293
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:38,383
Yo, Jessica.

294
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,054
Hi.

295
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:43,655
Hi.

296
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:46,091
So, um, that dead reaper
in there, is that why

297
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:48,126
you're all of a sudden
so interested in helping?

298
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:50,128
I'm glad you're ready
to chat now.

299
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,464
This will be
a positive experience.

300
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:54,633
Okay, you can drop the whole
warm and fuzzy thing.

301
00:16:54,635 --> 00:16:55,968
That's just a useful affect.

302
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,769
I'm still
an instrument of Death.

303
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:00,706
You know, you could've told us
Rowena was killing reapers.

304
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,008
And I would have,
but you were “handing it”.

305
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,110
Okay, all right, talk.

306
00:17:05,112 --> 00:17:07,346
Rowena's
changing people's fates.

307
00:17:07,348 --> 00:17:09,014
She's killing them
before their time,

308
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:11,817
and when a reaper shows...
She torches them, too.

309
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,418
- Yes.
- Why?

310
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,488
You'll have to ask her
when you stop her.

311
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,826
Because if she keeps this up,
she's going to throw off fate.

312
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:23,428
The whole greater machinery
of Death.

313
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,997
That means...

314
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:26,865
Have you ever heard
of the Butterfly Effect?

315
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:29,334
Ashton's second-best movie.
Yes, of course.

316
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:31,973
Uh, uh, one small mistake can --
can cause all kinds of bad.

317
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:32,853
What about it?

318
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:35,462
If just one person dies
before their time,

319
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:38,710
a lot of things that were
supposed to happen, don't.

320
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:40,879
The ripple effect
from just one early death

321
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:42,814
can affect hundreds of lives.

322
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:44,750
And changing their fates
changes even more fates

323
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:47,619
until things become
sincerely unfortunate,

324
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:50,155
and we have to
hit the reset button.

325
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:51,590
What does that mean?

326
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,759
Usually? A mass kill-off.

327
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:57,629
Like the Black Plague
or a mid-sized war.

328
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,965
Something to
wipe the board clean.

329
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,467
So your helping
avoiding that

330
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:05,103
would be
greatly appreciated,

331
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:07,205
by everyone.

332
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:08,740
If it's so bad,
why don't you stop her?

333
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:10,375
You've met Billie, right?

334
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:12,177
She's got rules.

335
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,712
Clean hands.

336
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:15,547
No interference.

337
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:18,684
Well, no <i>direct</i> interference,
anyway.

338
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:22,955
We can't stop her,
but you can.

339
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:25,357
What? Me?

340
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,293
Death keeps notebooks with
all the ways a person might die,

341
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:30,028
depending on their choices.

342
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,863
Dean's seen his.

343
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:33,231
I got a whole shelf.

344
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:35,467
But in Rowena MacLeod's
notebook,

345
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:38,036
her death is always
the same --

346
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:40,439
She's killed,
Sam Winchester,

347
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:42,140
by <i>you.</i>

348
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:16,541
Sorry to keep you waiting.

349
00:19:16,543 --> 00:19:18,210
It's fine.

350
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:19,878
Actually,
it's -- it's not fine

351
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,248
because all of creation is
at stake, but here we are.

352
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,852
Yes, well...
there's a lot going on.

353
00:19:26,854 --> 00:19:28,553
Yeah, I noticed.

354
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:31,590
Dumah, what did you mean that
we could help each other?

355
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:34,593
Find Gabriel and bring him
back to us, back home,

356
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:37,195
and we can help you
with everything else --

357
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:39,431
battling Michael,
defending Earth.

358
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:40,866
I can't find him.

359
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:43,168
That's why
I need your help.

360
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,871
Right.

361
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:47,939
Well, then,
that's a problem.

362
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:50,175
I don't understand. Can't you
find a few angels to --

363
00:19:50,177 --> 00:19:52,244
That's enough, Castiel.

364
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:57,983
<i>- Hold still.</i>
<i>- Aah!</i>

365
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:00,786
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- Hold still.</i>

366
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:03,021
<i>Aah!</i>

367
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:06,725
It's not that
we won't help you.

368
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:09,394
It's that we can't.

369
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:14,132
Okay, it definitely looks
like she's working her way

370
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:16,401
through these
Pirodine Pharmaceutical people.

371
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:18,170
Have any idea who's next?

372
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:21,239
No, I mean, everybody mentioned
in the article is already dead.

373
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:23,108
Wait a second.

374
00:20:24,378 --> 00:20:27,079
Except for James Melford,

375
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:29,581
the, uh, CEO.

376
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,850
All right, what do we know
about him?

377
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:33,385
He's dying.
Uhh!

378
00:20:33,387 --> 00:20:35,520
Stop doing that!

379
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:36,955
What do you mean
he -- he's --

380
00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:38,423
James Melford's
already bound for Hell,

381
00:20:38,425 --> 00:20:40,826
but his time of death
just shifted.

382
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:43,295
To when?
Now.

383
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:49,101
This is a lovely backyard,

384
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:52,804
but you really shouldn't have
tried to run, James.

385
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,673
Please don't.
After what you've done

386
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:57,676
to so many sick people all over
this country,

387
00:20:57,678 --> 00:20:59,845
letting them suffer
and taking their money?

388
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,947
You should consider
this death a blessing

389
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:04,716
because you're finally
helping someone else.

390
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:06,251
Who?

391
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:07,686
Shh.

392
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:09,254
Wait for it.

393
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:17,362
Ah, there he is.

394
00:21:17,364 --> 00:21:19,164
You can see me?
Aye.

395
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,067
Do you have a message for me
from your boss?

396
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:25,403
One quick chat,
and all of this will end.

397
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,839
Death doesn't negotiate
with witches.

398
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:29,741
We'll see.

399
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:34,246
<i>Mors lumine.</i>

400
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,283
Well, so much
for James Melford.

401
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:55,487
And Martin. His reaper.

402
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:58,022
His name was Martin.

403
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:02,460
Here we go.

404
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:04,662
Rowena.

405
00:22:04,664 --> 00:22:07,599
I don't suppose there's any way
you'll simply

406
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:12,003
leave me to my business before
something unfortunate happens?

407
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:14,105
Oh, you're starting off
with a threat. Nice.

408
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:17,442
I would never. But this doesn't
involve you boys.

409
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:19,677
<i>You're killing people.</i>
<i>It involves us.</i>

410
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,846
Mm, if you'd let me explain.

411
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:24,182
You think this is something
you can just explain away?

412
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:27,318
I trusted you.
<i>I know that, Sam.</i>

413
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,654
I'd just rather not talk about
this over the phone.

414
00:22:29,656 --> 00:22:32,657
I'll text you an address.
Meet me there in half an hour.

415
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:35,160
And then what?
<i>You believe me or you don't.</i>

416
00:22:35,162 --> 00:22:37,262
Either way,
the drinks are on me.

417
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:43,868
I don't like it. I mean, what's
the over/under this is a trap?

418
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,839
Well, it's Rowena.
Of course it's a trap.

419
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:54,012
Once we're face-to-face,
I'll convince them to stop

420
00:22:54,014 --> 00:22:56,548
or we'll stop them.

421
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,217
Are you ready, Bernard?

422
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,357
How are you alive?

423
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,226
A drill in the head
wasn't gonna kill me.

424
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:09,661
You should know that.

425
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:12,564
You know, I have to admit
I was...

426
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:15,099
I was relieved
to hear you were dead.

427
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:17,535
We never did see
eye to eye.

428
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:19,404
No.
Mm.

429
00:23:19,406 --> 00:23:21,439
No, we didn't,

430
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,742
because you stole
my memories,

431
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:28,246
and you threatened to
“tear me apart,”

432
00:23:28,248 --> 00:23:30,114
and you made me

433
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:33,418
repeatedly act out
Dean Winchester's murder,

434
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,756
and you killed
many, many people.

435
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:42,927
Those were simpler times.

436
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,798
“I'm sorry”
goes a long way.

437
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,933
Mm-hmm.

438
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,606
After Metatron attacked,
I had a few reliable angels

439
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:57,575
spread the word that I was dead.

440
00:23:57,577 --> 00:23:59,444
So you've been hiding.

441
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:01,279
Recovering.

442
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:03,348
All this time?

443
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,683
Well, forgive me
for taking a few years

444
00:24:05,685 --> 00:24:08,520
to put my thoughts
back in my skull.

445
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:13,424
There are still a few holes --
pardon the phrasing --

446
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:15,927
but I'm mostly here.

447
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:17,362
I have to be.

448
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:24,669
Do you know what
powers Heaven, Castiel?

449
00:24:26,106 --> 00:24:30,241
Yeah, us. Angels.

450
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:33,778
That's right. We're all...

451
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,383
Every angel is like
a walking, talking battery.

452
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,789
And <i>that</i> is what happens
when we run out of power.

453
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:46,257
I don't understand.

454
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:49,928
Well, then, let me make it
divinely simple for you.

455
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,598
There are a grand total
of nine angels in Heaven,

456
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
present company included.

457
00:24:55,602 --> 00:24:59,470
And one or two on Earth,
and...

458
00:24:59,472 --> 00:25:01,839
that's all.

459
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,076
We are
the last men and women

460
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:08,379
and divine waves of light
still standing,

461
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,081
as it were.

462
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:16,321
No, that's, uh...

463
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:20,925
That's not, um...

464
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:30,134
I knew our numbers
were small...

465
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:32,971
You wanna know why
we can't help you?

466
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:36,240
Because none of us
can leave.

467
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:38,543
We're the only things
keeping the lights on.

468
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:42,647
Barely.

469
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:44,616
We need everyone,

470
00:25:44,618 --> 00:25:46,784
especially an archangel.

471
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:50,388
Now the others thought
any archangel would do.

472
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,658
Long story.

473
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,961
But your news
about Gabriel is...

474
00:25:56,963 --> 00:26:00,331
for lack of a better word,
blessed.

475
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:05,470
With his power, we can
keep Heaven running.

476
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:07,105
And without him?

477
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,741
Without him, in time,

478
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:11,943
we'll burn out.

479
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,178
Heaven will crumble,

480
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,649
and all the souls that have
been entrusted to our care

481
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:19,417
will fall back to Earth.

482
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:22,987
Picture it, Castiel --

483
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:27,125
billions upon billions of ghosts
unleashed upon the world.

484
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,727
All that chaos,

485
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:32,463
all that death.

486
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:41,372
Heads up.

487
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,013
Boys.

488
00:26:49,015 --> 00:26:50,815
What's with the goon?

489
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,450
Just a precaution.

490
00:26:52,452 --> 00:26:54,185
We're all wary, aren't we?

491
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:57,088
Surely you've got your
witch-killing bullets handy.

492
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:00,725
Rowena, this isn't why
I helped you.

493
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:03,528
Were you just playing me
the whole time?

494
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,496
Of course not.

495
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,566
But once I unlocked my power,
I couldn't just hide away.

496
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:12,336
I realized I can right some
wrongs that are long overdue.

497
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:13,738
By killing innocents.

498
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,774
Innocents?
These drug company people,

499
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:19,677
they lied about their product
for money --

500
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,612
money they used
to avoid the law.

501
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:24,015
They've hurt
thousands of sick people,

502
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,050
which makes them far worse

503
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:28,019
than most of the monsters
you've killed.

504
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,922
And I'm striking a blow
for justice.

505
00:27:30,924 --> 00:27:34,392
Yeah? Then why are you
killing reapers?

506
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,862
Well...

507
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,964
they're just
a means to an end.

508
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:42,366
It's not easy to get
Death's attention.

509
00:27:42,368 --> 00:27:44,402
Well, trust me, that's not
the kind of attention you want.

510
00:27:44,404 --> 00:27:46,337
Oh, but it is.

511
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:48,606
Death has something I want.

512
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,374
What's that?

513
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:53,544
My son.

514
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,983
After you told me
he was gone, how he died,

515
00:27:58,985 --> 00:28:01,719
I had
an unexpected reaction.

516
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,821
We had our differences,

517
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:07,792
but it's my fault he went down
the path he did.

518
00:28:07,794 --> 00:28:10,094
I left him.

519
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:13,898
We're talking about Crowley --
demon, King of Hell.

520
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,902
We're talking about Fergus --
a man abandoned and loveless,

521
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,605
tricked by a demon,
died in a gutter.

522
00:28:20,607 --> 00:28:24,375
He deserved better
from the world, from me.

523
00:28:24,377 --> 00:28:26,544
Well, Crowley's dead.
There's no coming back from that.

524
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:28,846
Oh, is that so, Dean?

525
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:31,349
Are only Winchesters allowed
to come back from the dead?

526
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:34,952
The rest of us just have to
accept it? I don't think so.

527
00:28:34,954 --> 00:28:36,988
I'm putting Death on notice.

528
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,123
All right.
Well, she's taken notice.

529
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,025
“She”? Interesting.

530
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:43,694
And she's upset.
But you can quit this before...

531
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:45,596
I'm not afraid.

532
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,832
And as much as I enjoy
our little talks,

533
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,634
you can't stop me.

534
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:52,403
Actually, we can.
And what makes you think that?

535
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:54,272
Because every version
of your death,

536
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,108
your <i>real,</i> permanent death,
Sam's the one who kills you.

537
00:29:00,446 --> 00:29:03,080
I see.

538
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:05,950
Yeah.

539
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,451
But...

540
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:11,722
It's not gonna happen tonight.

541
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,529
I hope you don't
mind the astral projection.

542
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:21,399
Safety first, boys.

543
00:29:25,538 --> 00:29:27,839
Rowena!

544
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:29,240
Hey!

545
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:36,914
Rowena! Hey!

546
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:55,900
You know she's controlling
your brain.

547
00:29:55,902 --> 00:29:59,070
She's powerful,
she's gorgeous,

548
00:29:59,072 --> 00:30:01,038
and she's paying me
a small fortune.

549
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,809
That woman didn't have
to cast a spell on me.

550
00:30:38,144 --> 00:30:40,878
Rowena, stop!

551
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,513
Stay right there.

552
00:30:44,484 --> 00:30:46,651
Listen to me.

553
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:50,254
I get what you're trying
to do for Crowley,

554
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:51,789
but...

555
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:56,861
but you're messing with
the machinery of the universe.

556
00:30:56,863 --> 00:30:59,263
Death won't give you
what you want.

557
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:01,299
You have to stop.

558
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:04,502
I can't stop, Samuel.

559
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:07,138
You'll have to shoot me.

560
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:36,567
H-h-how...

561
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:39,870
You really would've shot me?

562
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:42,807
<i>Somnia.</i>

563
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:53,804
Uhh!
You're doing really well,

564
00:31:53,805 --> 00:31:54,911
but you need to hurry.

565
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:56,935
A little help would be nice.

566
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:01,158
Can't. Clean hands.

567
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:32,590
He was a highly trained
military operative.

568
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,960
It's impressive
that you could...

569
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:38,095
Sam!

570
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:03,621
Where the hell is
my brother?!

571
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:12,192
Don't struggle.
It'll only make things worse.

572
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:13,693
Rowena, you gotta
listen to me.

573
00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:15,194
This power's getting
to your head, okay?

574
00:33:15,196 --> 00:33:16,696
It's making you go crazy.

575
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:20,500
No. It's given me clarity.

576
00:33:20,502 --> 00:33:24,203
It's showing me that everything
I did before, for wealth,

577
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:26,839
for magic, for myself,

578
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:28,474
meant nothing.

579
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:30,276
And it took everything
from me,

580
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:32,879
everyone I love --
my family,

581
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:35,748
Oskar, my son.

582
00:33:37,152 --> 00:33:41,754
I'm a flawed, petty,
evil creature, Samuel.

583
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:44,190
I don't know
if I can be redeemed,

584
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,659
but I have to try.

585
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:49,195
And I do wish there was
another way.

586
00:33:49,197 --> 00:33:51,230
You...

587
00:33:51,232 --> 00:33:52,865
What -- what are you saying?

588
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:54,334
Well, you said it
yourself.

589
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:56,836
There's only one way
to stop me -- you.

590
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:58,671
If you're dead,

591
00:33:58,673 --> 00:34:01,674
well...then I can't
be stopped, can I?

592
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:03,843
Death will have to
grant me an audience.

593
00:34:07,382 --> 00:34:09,148
Oh, no, you -- you --
you don't know that.

594
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,983
True,

595
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:13,319
but there's only one way
to find out.

596
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:19,058
What are you doing?

597
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,760
What is that?

598
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,895
You don't wanna know.

599
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:29,068
Rowena, don't do this.

600
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,770
You don't have to do this.

601
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:32,739
What haven't you done
for your family?

602
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:34,640
What wouldn't you do?!

603
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,345
I'm sorry, Sam.

604
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:47,854
Hello, Rowena.

605
00:34:51,326 --> 00:34:54,227
You? I know you.

606
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:56,596
We met
when I was a reaper.

607
00:34:56,598 --> 00:34:58,097
We totally did.

608
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,932
If we'd just exchanged numbers,

609
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:01,701
none of this would've
been necessary.

610
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:04,570
You're upsetting
the natural order.

611
00:35:04,572 --> 00:35:06,839
That's...

612
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:08,574
unwise.

613
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:12,545
Bring back my son,
and it all stops.

614
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:15,314
- Say no, and I'll --
- No.

615
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:19,085
Then I'll kill Sam Winchester.

616
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:22,255
That'll really frog up
your natural order, won't it?!

617
00:35:22,257 --> 00:35:23,689
Go ahead.

618
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,493
What?

619
00:35:27,495 --> 00:35:29,228
I don't think it's
a good thing,

620
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,497
and I don't believe any of us
will like what comes next,

621
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:33,766
but I don't do blackmail.

622
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:37,036
So...go ahead.

623
00:35:43,645 --> 00:35:46,779
I'm curious to see
what happens.

624
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:50,817
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No. Rowena.

625
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:52,251
I know
what you went through

626
00:35:52,253 --> 00:35:54,020
and I know
how much you lost

627
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:56,222
and I realize how much
you want your family back.

628
00:35:56,224 --> 00:35:59,892
But don't do this,
not like this.

629
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:02,695
This is not you.

630
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:04,263
Not anymore.

631
00:36:04,265 --> 00:36:08,568
What happened to me,
those were my choices.

632
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,404
But Fergus never...

633
00:36:11,406 --> 00:36:13,606
It wasn't fair.

634
00:36:15,043 --> 00:36:17,577
It's not fair!

635
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:34,026
You were never gonna
kill him.

636
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:36,295
There was a time
you would've,

637
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:39,799
but not now.

638
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:46,472
I can see that.

639
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:49,208
I don't know what I'm doing.

640
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:53,779
Sometimes life is unfair

641
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:56,549
and sometimes
we lose things

642
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:59,418
and sometimes we make
mistakes.

643
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:04,857
And some of these things
can never be fixed

644
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:07,193
no matter how powerful
you become.

645
00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:09,662
Some things just are,

646
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:12,632
and everyone has to live
with that.

647
00:37:14,235 --> 00:37:17,336
And now you'll take me?

648
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:18,905
No.

649
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:23,676
You already know
how your story ends.

650
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,583
Uhh! Sam!

651
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:32,418
Dean!

652
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:35,788
Hey, Dean.

653
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:39,959
See you again soon.

654
00:37:53,913 --> 00:37:56,887
If you find Gabriel, tell him
what's happening in Heaven.

655
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:59,281
And if I can't find him?

656
00:37:59,804 --> 00:38:03,740
We'll do our duty,
keep things running.

657
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:06,175
For how long?

658
00:38:06,177 --> 00:38:08,478
Ah.

659
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,947
That's the scary part.

660
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:14,517
We will find a way
to fix this.

661
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,852
We will.

662
00:38:15,854 --> 00:38:17,854
This may be
one of those things

663
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,490
that can't be fixed,
Castiel.

664
00:38:20,492 --> 00:38:24,327
This is Heaven
we're talking about.

665
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:28,431
Everything ends, Castiel.

666
00:38:32,871 --> 00:38:35,438
Everything ends.

667
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,173
But until then,

668
00:38:37,175 --> 00:38:39,642
the gates of Heaven
are closed.

669
00:39:18,883 --> 00:39:20,683
How you feelin'?

670
00:39:20,685 --> 00:39:23,052
Like I got punched
in the face. A lot.

671
00:39:23,054 --> 00:39:25,755
Yes, about that...

672
00:39:25,757 --> 00:39:27,857
Bernard's
very enthusiastic.

673
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:29,959
Yeah, that's one word
for it.

674
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,130
And what about you?
How are you feelin'?

675
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,302
I fought Death and lost.

676
00:39:39,304 --> 00:39:42,905
I feel tired. Weaker.

677
00:39:42,907 --> 00:39:45,975
I don't know
if it's forever.

678
00:39:45,977 --> 00:39:48,811
Sam, what have I done?

679
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:54,684
You had a chance to kill me
and -- and you didn't.

680
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,720
I'd call that progress.

681
00:39:59,124 --> 00:40:01,691
I'd call that a miracle.

682
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:03,693
And, you know,

683
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:06,629
what happened with Crowley,
that wasn't your fault.

684
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:08,965
He never had a chance.

685
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:10,399
He made his choices.

686
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,337
Just like we all do.

687
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:16,339
Look, every one of us
has done something

688
00:40:16,341 --> 00:40:17,707
that we have to live with,

689
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:20,710
that we're trying
to make up for.

690
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:22,245
Every one of us.

691
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:24,647
Even without
all that extra juice,

692
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:28,317
you're still
the deadliest witch around.

693
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,520
Flatterer.

694
00:40:30,522 --> 00:40:33,823
Yeah, well, we, um...

695
00:40:33,825 --> 00:40:36,359
we may need your help

696
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:38,494
to save our family, to...

697
00:40:38,496 --> 00:40:40,997
hell, to save the world.

698
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,365
You wanna be redeemed?

699
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:44,934
This would be
a pretty big step.

700
00:40:44,936 --> 00:40:48,738
And you think
I still can be?

701
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,141
Yeah. I do.

702
00:40:52,143 --> 00:40:54,043
We both do.

703
00:40:54,045 --> 00:40:56,179
But before you answer,
you gotta know something.

704
00:40:56,181 --> 00:40:58,581
Um...

705
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,017
Lucifer is back.

706
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:02,718
Mm.

707
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,187
Of course he is.

708
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:05,955
Now you're not gonna...

709
00:41:05,957 --> 00:41:09,292
Breakdown?
Crack apart in terror?

710
00:41:09,294 --> 00:41:11,761
Of course I'm horrified
and scared.

711
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:15,164
My heart may have
stopped, but...

712
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:22,038
Lucifer isn't the one
who's gonna kill me, is he?

713
00:41:25,977 --> 00:41:28,878
You changed
other people's fates.

714
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,013
Maybe we can change yours.

715
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:35,418
So...

716
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,819
What do you say? You in?

717
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:48,701
