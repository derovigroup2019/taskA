1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,480
I can't control...

2
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:06,749
Mom!
...whatever this is.

3
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,718
Jack is a nephilim.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,286
He's Lucifer's son.

5
00:00:10,288 --> 00:00:12,054
- I'm sorry.
- What?

6
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:13,556
Will you tell them
that I'm sorry?

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:16,459
Jack is not evil.
He's just a kid.

8
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:18,961
We need to help Jack learn
how to control his powers.

9
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:20,930
So I don't hurt
anyone anymore.

10
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:23,399
Oh!

11
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,800
See this pencil?

12
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:26,903
I want you to move it
with your mind.

13
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:28,638
I...can't.

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,508
I can't do the one good thing
you want me to.

15
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,011
I must be evil.
No!

16
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:36,345
It doesn't matter
what you are.

17
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:40,316
It matters what you do.

18
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:43,085
You did good today.

19
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:45,521
There are zombies here...

20
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:48,591
...which means head shot.

21
00:00:48,593 --> 00:00:50,159
People come back?

22
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:52,528
No!

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,098
What gets burned
stays dead.

24
00:00:57,602 --> 00:01:01,204
- Goodbye, Cass.
- Castiel.

25
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:03,005
<i>Castiel.</i>

26
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:04,907
?

27
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:06,475
What is this place?

28
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:09,645
Angels and demons, you all
come here when you die.

29
00:01:09,647 --> 00:01:11,280
What are you?

30
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:13,783
Oh, I'm just your friendly
neighborhood cosmic entity.

31
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:15,885
Having you awake,
it's like a gnat.

32
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:18,354
If having me awake
causes you pain,

33
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:21,190
send me back to Earth.
Pretty smart.

34
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:26,329
?

35
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:27,763
What?

36
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:34,670
?

37
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:06,269
What the hell?

38
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,439
Come on.

39
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,050
Where'd he go?

40
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,957
He's messin' with us.

41
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,592
He's too damn fast.

42
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:33,262
Not faster than bullets.

43
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:40,736
?

44
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:45,541
?

45
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,546
All right, you wait here.

46
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:52,915
I'm-a flush him out.

47
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:04,093
Aah!

48
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:05,494
Sarge?

49
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:09,732
?

50
00:03:13,204 --> 00:03:15,071
Aw, hell.

00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:34,557
Cass, is that really you?

55
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:39,962
No. You're -- you're dead.

56
00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:43,833
Yeah, I was.

57
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:47,903
But then I...annoyed
an ancient cosmic being so much

58
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:49,372
that he sent me back.

59
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:52,775
I don't even know
what to say.

60
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:58,381
I do.

61
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:01,417
Welcome home, pal.

62
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:07,757
?

63
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:14,296
?

64
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:16,165
How long was I gone?

65
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,467
Too damn long.

66
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:21,604
Where were you? In Heaven?

67
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:25,174
No.

68
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:27,109
No, I was in the Empty.

69
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,212
Really?

70
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:34,049
Apparently, it's where angels
and demons go when they die.

71
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:36,118
What was it like?

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,422
Well, it's dark

73
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:42,124
and...nothing.

74
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:47,096
It's like...nothing.

75
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,398
I was sleeping,
and then I heard a voice

76
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,667
that said my name,
and I woke up.

77
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:55,938
I thought you...
had done something.

78
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,473
No, we...

79
00:04:57,475 --> 00:04:59,608
we didn't even think
we could bring you back.

80
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:02,645
So who was it?

81
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,613
Chuck -- uh, God?

82
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:08,083
No.

83
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:10,619
No, he has no power
in the Empty.

84
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:13,355
Well, then, who does?

85
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:17,293
Jack.

86
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,500
How'd it go?

87
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:26,435
Well...

88
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:28,337
Jack, um...

89
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:31,907
What's wrong?

90
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:40,015
Hello, Jack.

91
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:43,185
Castiel?

92
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:45,988
Yeah, it's me.

93
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,891
No.

94
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:53,395
We burned your body,
and what's burned stays dead.

95
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:54,864
How...

96
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:58,200
Well, that's the question
we've been askin'.

97
00:05:58,202 --> 00:06:01,237
Jack...

98
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,639
did you, uh...

99
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:06,609
Did you bring Cass back?

100
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:09,912
I don't know.

101
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:13,349
I wanted him back. I...

102
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:16,519
begged for him
to come back, but...

103
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,454
Well, here he is.

104
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:23,359
Because of me?

105
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:24,760
We don't know.
We don't know, Jack.

106
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:26,395
But we --
we -- we think maybe.

107
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,599
Thank you, Jack.

108
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:38,274
I missed you so much.

109
00:06:44,982 --> 00:06:48,417
Sam and Dean tell me
you're doing well.

110
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,185
I am.

111
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:52,354
I...

112
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:54,256
Watch this.

113
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:01,463
Wow.

114
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:03,098
I can move the pencil.

115
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,935
And...I found a case.

116
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:07,336
Hunter's case.

117
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:10,005
What kind of a --
Zombies.

118
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:11,807
I know
what zombies are now.

119
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:14,009
You see?

120
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:15,744
Wait. Where'd you learn
to do that?

121
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:18,047
By watching you. And Sam.

122
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:20,249
Three days ago,
a vintage pocket watch

123
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:22,651
with a personal inscription
was sold at a pawn shop.

124
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:24,253
But when they went to
authenticate it,

125
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:26,388
they found out that it'd been
buried with its owner...

126
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,790
20 years ago.

127
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:31,026
And when they checked out
the grave, it was empty.

128
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:32,561
Which means...

129
00:07:32,563 --> 00:07:36,198
the dead are rising
in Dodge City, Kansas.

130
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:43,939
?

131
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:47,142
Right. O-or maybe it's
a-a grave robbery, but...

132
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:48,544
Oh.

133
00:07:48,546 --> 00:07:50,379
Yeah, but we should
probably check it out.

134
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:51,814
Wait. Really?

135
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:55,084
Yeah, we've done more on less.

136
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:58,621
Besides Dodge City's kind of,
uh, kind of awesome.

137
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:02,191
?

138
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:03,892
All right, well...

139
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:05,661
two salty hunters,

140
00:08:05,663 --> 00:08:07,730
one half-angel kid,

141
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:11,734
and a dude who just
came back from the dead. Again.

142
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:15,404
Team Free Will 2.0.
Here we go.

143
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:27,149
?

144
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:29,985
All right,
this is supposed to be

145
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,254
the best room in the joint.

146
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:43,298
Oh, ho!

147
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,835
The Wild Bill suite.

148
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,074
Wow.

149
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:55,144
Pretty cool, right?

150
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:56,679
Dude! Check it out,
check it out, check it out.

151
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:58,180
Clay Allison --

152
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:00,315
gun fighter extraordinaire,
right?

153
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:02,351
And, uh, Curly Bill Brocius,
which -- now, now, now,

154
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:03,719
little fun fact here --

155
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:06,221
was killed by Wyatt Earp
himself.

156
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:08,624
Not kidding.

157
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:11,393
Johnny Ringo,

158
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:14,630
Billy the Kid. Oh, look!
He really likes cowboys.

159
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:17,332
Hey, big guy. How you doin'?
That's...

160
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:20,769
What's going on, Calamity Jane?
Yes. Yes, he does.

161
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:23,439
Doc Holliday!
Hey-oh!

162
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:25,641
This is awesome.

163
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:27,376
All right, I say quick shower,
steak dinner,

164
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:30,212
and then tomorrow,
we hit up the cemetery.

165
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:32,748
Sounds like a plan.

166
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,518
Oh, yes! Stirrup hangers!

167
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,754
You can have the couch if you want.

168
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:41,023
I don't sleep much.

169
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:43,225
I don't sleep at all.

170
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:49,465
Still can't believe
you brought your own hat.

171
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:52,868
Well, I can't believe
you didn't.

172
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,970
You're in a good mood,
huh?

173
00:09:54,972 --> 00:09:57,473
Yeah. And?

174
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:59,007
Nothing.

175
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:01,944
No, no, I-I-I just, uh...

176
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:04,179
you've been having
a rough go, so it's...

177
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:06,014
it's good
to see you smile.

178
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:09,852
Well, I said I needed
a big win.

179
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:13,489
We got Cass back. That's
a pretty damn big win.

180
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:15,457
Yeah.

181
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,359
Fair enough.

182
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:23,866
Run that plate, would you, Sophie?

183
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:26,368
<i>Copy, Carl. Will do.</i>

184
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,371
Let's see who this pile
of junk belongs to.

185
00:10:55,299 --> 00:11:00,669
?

186
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:04,873
<i>Carl, we got a match</i>
<i>on that plate.</i>

187
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,242
<i>Looks like the truck</i>
<i>was stolen.</i>

188
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,224
Aah!

189
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,030
<i>Carl? Carl?</i>

190
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:29,565
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

191
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,934
<i>Carl, do you copy?</i>

192
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,193
And then there were
these angels

193
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:41,361
and they tried to kill me,
but...

194
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:43,297
I thought angels
were good?

195
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:46,600
Well, in Heaven,
“good's” a relative turn.

196
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:50,237
What's it like? Heaven?

197
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,639
Well, that depends.

198
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:54,475
But it's nice?

199
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:56,176
It can be.

200
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:58,245
That's good.

201
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:01,081
My mother's in Heaven.

202
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,452
Yeah, I know she is.

203
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:07,254
Kelly was...

204
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:09,490
She was
a very brave woman.

205
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,859
She left me a message.

206
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,928
She said I had an angel
watching over me.

207
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:20,467
Jack, I'm so sorry.
I-I should've been here for you.

208
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:24,938
No. It's okay. It's just...

209
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,275
I understand
why she trusted you.

210
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:31,378
Why <i>I</i> trusted you.

211
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:35,449
You remember that?

212
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:39,353
I remember feeling...safe.

213
00:12:41,023 --> 00:12:43,657
Jack, your mother,

214
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:46,827
she believed that you would
do amazing things.

215
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:50,664
She said that you would
change the world for the better.

216
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,866
And now,

217
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:56,537
looking at you,
talking to you,

218
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:59,206
I know that she was right,

219
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,109
that we were right.

220
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:06,346
Kelly would be so proud
of you.

221
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:17,524
Oh, wow.

222
00:13:17,526 --> 00:13:19,827
I'll go tell them.
Jack. Jack!

223
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,197
Dean? Dean?
Jack, I wouldn't do that!

224
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:24,665
Aah!

225
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,000
No, no, no!
Dean, it's me. It's me.

226
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:32,172
Ah, hey.

227
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,410
Who's making me coffee?

228
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:57,698
I told you.
He's an angry sleeper.

229
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,099
Like a bear.

230
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:01,368
Okay, so “code three”
means an officer down.

231
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,571
Looks like the victim was --
Covered in bite marks.

232
00:14:05,774 --> 00:14:07,307
Like from a zombie.

233
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:09,376
Or anything else
that has teeth.

234
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:11,144
All right, change of plans.

235
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:12,646
Jack and I will hit
the graveyard.

236
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:14,715
You and Cass hit up
the crime scene.

237
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:16,650
Works for me.

238
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:23,857
?

239
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:28,729
Ahh.

240
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:30,797
?

241
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:44,745
?

242
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:47,581
Al  right, listen,
these Dodge City cops

243
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,249
aren't likely to trust
big city folks,

244
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:52,619
so we're gonna have
to blend.

245
00:14:52,621 --> 00:14:56,223
Which is why you're making me
wear this absurd hat.

246
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:58,392
It's not that bad.

247
00:14:58,394 --> 00:15:01,328
Well, actually, yeah,
it kind of is. Hang on.

248
00:15:02,665 --> 00:15:04,431
All right. That's better.

249
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,099
Is it?

250
00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:09,636
Yeah.

251
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:12,806
Look, just act like you're
from “Tombstone,” okay?

252
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:14,207
The city?

253
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:16,610
The <i>movie.</i>

254
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:18,111
With Kurt Russell?
I made you watch it.

255
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:19,546
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

256
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:22,249
The one with the guns
and tuberculosis.

257
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:25,485
“I'm your Huckleberry.”

258
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:28,255
Yeah, exactly.

259
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:30,524
Well, it's good
to have you back, Cass.

260
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:32,693
All right, follow my lead.

261
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:34,895
We'll fit right in.

262
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:46,406
? I told you 'bout living
in the U.S. of A. ?

263
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:50,444
? Don't you know that I'm
a gangster of love? ?

264
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:55,082
? I'm a space cowboy ?

265
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:57,884
? Bet you weren't ready
for that ?

266
00:15:57,886 --> 00:15:59,353
Howdy, pardner.

267
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:01,154
Who's in charge here?

268
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:02,889
Much obliged.

269
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:05,492
? I'm sure you know
where it's at ?

270
00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:07,060
? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ?

271
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:09,563
Sheriff Phillips?

272
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:13,233
It's Sarge.
Sergeant Joe Phillips.

273
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:15,369
Sheriff's on vacation.

274
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:17,304
Well, I'm Agent Russell.
This here is my associate.

275
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:22,709
Uh, Kilmer.
My name is Val Kilmer.

276
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:30,550
Yeah, okay.
What do you want?

277
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:33,120
Well, we heard about the attack
over the wire last night.

278
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:35,055
Wondering what you can
tell us about the victim.

279
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:38,225
His name was Carl Phillips.
Deputy Carl Phillips.

280
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:42,262
He's...was my nephew.

281
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:44,798
Some psycho slit his throat

282
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,201
and left the body out
for the coyotes to chew on.

283
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:52,973
I knew that boy since he was
a day old.

284
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:56,276
Well, we're deeply sorry
for your loss.

285
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:02,082
Anyway, what the hell's
the Texas Rangers

286
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:04,051
even doing up here?

287
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:07,587
Well, actually, we're FB--
Rangers. That's right.

288
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,456
Texas Rangers.

289
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,358
Mm-hmm.

290
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,895
We've been tracking a fugitive
who skipped across state lines.

291
00:17:14,897 --> 00:17:17,297
He's a real mean
son of a gun.

292
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,733
He's been robbing graves.

293
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:22,469
Oh. We got us one of them.

294
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:25,672
Carl was the one
looking in on it.

295
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:26,940
You think
there's a connection?

296
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:29,876
Could be.

297
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:33,480
Well, you boys are more than
welcome to poke around, but...

298
00:17:33,482 --> 00:17:36,183
I catch up with
your runner first,

299
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:39,186
there ain't gonna be much left
of him to take back to Texas.

300
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:42,789
- You can count on it.
- Mm.

301
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:59,539
<i>?</i>

302
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,042
<i>? They call me zombie,</i>
<i>I don't know why ?</i>

303
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:03,677
<i>? They call me zombie ?</i>

304
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,350
<i>?</i>

305
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:12,953
<i>? They call me zombie,</i>
<i>I don't know why ?</i>

306
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:17,157
<i>?</i>

307
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,025
Dude! What the hell?

308
00:18:19,027 --> 00:18:21,261
Sorry. Sorry, I-I didn't mean
to scare --

309
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:23,263
Um, there was no one upstairs.

310
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:25,432
Yeah, it's just me.

311
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:27,167
And you are...

312
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:30,003
Athena Lopez, undertaker.

313
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:31,471
And you are?

314
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:33,373
Agent Elliot.

315
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:38,478
That's Agent Paxton. FBI.

316
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
<i>He's</i> an FBI agent?

317
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:43,250
Did his parents
sign a permission slip?

318
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:47,854
He's a trainee.
Top of his class.

319
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:49,923
Anyway, we're here about
the grave robbery.

320
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:51,892
Uh, you live
on the premises, right?

321
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:53,293
All my life.

322
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:54,761
But according to
the police report,

323
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:56,263
you didn't see anyone
that night.

324
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:59,232
I was out.
Amanda Palmer concert.

325
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:00,967
Amanda Palmer?

326
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:03,069
What about anything weird?

327
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:06,439
Cold spots?
Strange smells?

328
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,977
I just said, I wasn't here.

329
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:14,981
Right. We're just trying
to figure out what happened.

330
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:17,617
That's all.
You and me both.

331
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:19,152
Look, if you guys wanna
check out the grave,

332
00:19:19,154 --> 00:19:22,222
the cops have it roped off,
over on the west plot.

333
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:24,925
Great. Thanks. Again, sorry.

334
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:30,230
There's something here.

335
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:31,965
No, wait. There.

336
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,668
Jack, put that away.
We're in a graveyard.

337
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,604
There's gonna be EMF everywhere.

338
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:43,176
The police report said
something about

339
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:45,612
rats damaging the coffin.

340
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:49,349
That's one big rat.

341
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:50,951
Yeah.

342
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,421
?

343
00:19:54,423 --> 00:19:56,723
All right.

344
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:58,825
Here goes nothin'.

345
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:12,305
?

346
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:20,480
?

347
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:24,251
?

348
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:27,287
What's that?

349
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:28,822
I think it's...

350
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:30,223
Leftovers.

351
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:33,994
Yeah, bite marks.
Looks like a ghoul.

352
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:39,399
Oh, a ghoul is a monster
that feeds on the dead.

353
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:43,003
They can take the form
of whomever they've eaten.

354
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:45,005
Decapitation kills them.

355
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:47,207
Yeah, or bashing
their brains in.

356
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:50,610
So like a...
zombie shape-shifter?

357
00:20:50,612 --> 00:20:52,145
Pretty much, yeah.

358
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:54,414
And he could have tunnels
all over that graveyard.

359
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:58,451
But if it could be anyone,
how do we find it?

360
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:04,758
<i>? I'm gonna rock... ?</i>

361
00:21:06,228 --> 00:21:07,727
Can I just say I'm getting
real sick and tired

362
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:09,763
of fighting things
that look like other things?

363
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:11,197
Maybe the ghoul is this Athena.

364
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:14,100
Yeah. A-a ghoul who owns
a mortuary.

365
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:16,469
That's smart, but...

366
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:18,305
No. She's got access
to the bodies

367
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:20,140
before they're ever
in the ground.

368
00:21:20,142 --> 00:21:21,641
Anything she wants,
she would just take.

369
00:21:21,643 --> 00:21:22,447
She doesn't have
to dig 'em back up.

370
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:24,132
Right.

371
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:34,754
<i>?</i>

372
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:39,192
<i>?</i>

373
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:40,760
I think I found something.

374
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:42,529
I tracked the plates
on the stolen truck

375
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:44,297
from the crime scene,
and I went through

376
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:48,134
the city's traffic camera
footage, and look.

377
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:51,004
This is it.

378
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:55,608
From yesterday,
before the deputy was killed.

379
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:00,313
Well, then, who's drivin'?

380
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:06,353
Holy crap.

381
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:08,088
That's Dave Mather.

382
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:13,526
Who?
Dave Mather.

383
00:22:13,528 --> 00:22:15,528
Dave! Not cool.

384
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,832
What? It's your own fault,
bent over all sexy.

385
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:20,367
I don't like when
you do that.

386
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:23,403
You do like it. Sometimes.

387
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:26,940
Cowboy. Outlaw.

388
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:29,209
One of
the Dodge City gang.

389
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:31,544
Come here.

390
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:36,816
?

391
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:41,287
He was one of the greatest
gunfights <i>ever.</i>

392
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:42,655
I mean, he died in 1886,

393
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:44,524
which makes this
a little weird, but...

394
00:22:44,526 --> 00:22:47,293
Mysterious Dave Mather.

395
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:50,497
I'm gonna get my boots on.

396
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:53,299
One of the best
gunslingers ever! Whoo!

397
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:55,101
You got a letter,

398
00:22:55,103 --> 00:22:56,870
and it's from
that makeup school.

399
00:22:56,872 --> 00:22:58,271
Thought you said
you weren't gonna apply.

400
00:22:58,273 --> 00:22:59,839
Changed my mind.

401
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:01,908
And it's not
“that makeup school.”

402
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,444
It's the Ben Carruth Makeup
and Special Effects Program.

403
00:23:04,446 --> 00:23:06,112
It's the best.

404
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:08,882
The Carruth Program.
Got it.

405
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:11,551
“Dear Ms. Lopez, after
reviewing your portfolio,

406
00:23:11,553 --> 00:23:15,655
we've decided to accept you
into our fall semester.”

407
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:17,757
Babe, I got in.

408
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,293
Cool.

409
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:22,162
Don't get too excited.

410
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:24,230
No, I...

411
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:26,499
I think it's great that
you got in that.

412
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:28,835
But?

413
00:23:28,837 --> 00:23:30,970
But it's in Los Angeles,

414
00:23:30,972 --> 00:23:33,339
and we're not exactly
swimming in cash here.

415
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:35,141
City living,
it's expensive.

416
00:23:35,143 --> 00:23:37,076
Yeah,
and they've got loans.

417
00:23:37,078 --> 00:23:39,345
I could sell this place
if I needed to.

418
00:23:39,347 --> 00:23:42,315
Athena, don't you think
we have a good thing here?

419
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:46,653
Why do you wanna go
mess it up?

420
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:50,623
Whatever. I have to work.

421
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,160
Athena.

422
00:23:54,162 --> 00:23:56,029
Two FBI agents
came by today.

423
00:23:57,766 --> 00:23:59,532
What for?

424
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:01,000
It was about
the grave robbery,

425
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:02,869
but they asked
these weird questions

426
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:06,439
about cold spots,
strange smells.

427
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:10,176
So our ghoul ate some Old West
gunfighter and stole his face?

428
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:11,644
That's what it looks like.
Ha.

429
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:14,581
I think I've seen him before.

430
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,016
There was a picture
at the mortuary.

431
00:24:17,018 --> 00:24:19,986
?

432
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:23,423
He's Athena's boyfriend.

433
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:31,698
?

434
00:24:35,537 --> 00:24:38,137
All right.

435
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:40,039
So what do we tell
Athena?

436
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,975
Well, we keep it simple,

437
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:44,344
tell her the guy
she's banging

438
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:46,546
eats dead people,
and we're here to kill him.

439
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:49,382
Or we could lie.
Yeah, we definitely lie.

440
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:54,821
Athena?

441
00:24:54,823 --> 00:24:58,358
What the hell are you doing
in my house? Again.

442
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,026
Look, I-I'm a...

443
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:02,595
I know who you are.
Answer the question.

444
00:25:02,597 --> 00:25:04,330
Okay, my -- my associate
and I,

445
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:06,666
we're -- we're looking
for your boyfriend.

446
00:25:06,668 --> 00:25:09,002
Why? Is this about
the grave robbery?

447
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:11,004
And a murder.
A what?

448
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:13,540
Sheriff's deputy
was killed last night.

449
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,276
We just wanna talk to him.
That's all.

450
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:19,712
So...do you know
where he is?

451
00:25:19,714 --> 00:25:21,981
He said he had to go
to the bank.

452
00:25:21,983 --> 00:25:24,751
Have a good night, ma'am.

453
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:31,391
Hey, Shawnte. Locking up.

454
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:34,394
Okay, sounds good.

455
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:35,695
Howdy, pardner.

456
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:39,198
?

457
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:43,431
You hit that alarm,
you die.

458
00:25:43,928 --> 00:25:46,495
You hand me
that funny wad of cash

459
00:25:46,497 --> 00:25:49,098
with the dye pack in it,
you die.

460
00:25:50,468 --> 00:25:54,537
<i>You.</i> You try and play hero,
big boy, you die.

461
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,305
You got me?

462
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:00,309
Dave Mather.

463
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:02,712
Robbing a bank.
That's a bold move.

464
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:06,849
?

465
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:08,951
You must be the Hunter.

466
00:26:08,953 --> 00:26:10,853
And you must like
to play cowboy.

467
00:26:10,855 --> 00:26:12,288
It's my favorite suit.

468
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,689
You know, I like to keep
a little piece

469
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:16,225
of old Dave on me
just to gnaw on.

470
00:26:18,796 --> 00:26:21,964
Let's make it
two, three,

471
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:23,566
<i>four</i> Hunters!

472
00:26:23,568 --> 00:26:26,702
Whoo!
Must be my birthday.

473
00:26:26,704 --> 00:26:29,272
Look, why don't you come
with us someplace else?

474
00:26:29,274 --> 00:26:31,474
We can do this quick and quiet.

475
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,788
Are you all right?
Yeah.

476
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:54,330
Whoo!

477
00:26:56,868 --> 00:26:59,201
Okay, you stay here.
No, it's okay. I've got this.

478
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,637
No, Jack. Jack!

479
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:03,372
Stay here.

480
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:04,640
Jack! Jack!
Hey!

481
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:11,814
?

482
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:13,683
What the hell?

483
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,627
No.

484
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:27,763
?

485
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:29,465
Check the guard.

486
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,067
No!

487
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:32,368
No. No, no, no, no.

488
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:42,278
?

489
00:27:42,547 --> 00:27:44,647
?

490
00:27:54,158 --> 00:27:57,426
?

491
00:27:57,428 --> 00:28:01,397
Cass, I-I didn't mean to.
Castiel, you have to heal him.

492
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:06,435
?

493
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:19,982
?

494
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:21,884
I can't.

495
00:28:21,886 --> 00:28:23,753
Why -- why not?

496
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,657
He's dead.

497
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:35,531
?

498
00:28:45,544 --> 00:28:48,578
Is this the first time
he's hurt anyone?

499
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,314
No. No, but it is
the first time

500
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:54,117
he's hurt someone
that didn't get back up.

501
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:04,160
All right, you two should get
Jack back to the bunker.

502
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:06,262
What?

503
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:08,631
The cops are gonna be
on their way.

504
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:10,300
We gotta get him out of town.

505
00:29:10,302 --> 00:29:13,369
Okay, but what -- what about
the ghoul? I can stay here.

506
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:15,438
No, I'll handle it.

507
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,741
Besides, you need to be with
the kid in case he...you know.

508
00:29:23,615 --> 00:29:26,816
Okay. All right.

509
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,963
Ha.

510
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,566
Hey, baby.

511
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:45,535
Dave, what happened?

512
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,437
Uh, I got shot.

513
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:50,340
Oh, my God.
Ow!

514
00:29:50,342 --> 00:29:51,774
It's not a big deal.

515
00:29:51,776 --> 00:29:54,844
Hey, I robbed a bank
for you.

516
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:57,313
What are you talking about?

517
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:01,885
I-I...
I changed my mind.

518
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:05,321
You can go to that school,
and I'm gonna come with you.

519
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:08,758
Okay? But we gotta leave now.
So big city, here we come.

520
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,159
Are you insane?

521
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:11,961
No, look,
I can pawn jewelry

522
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:13,696
for stuff like
concert tickets.

523
00:30:13,698 --> 00:30:15,198
But if we're skipping down,

524
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,867
digging up a few bodies
just ain't gonna cut it.

525
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:21,304
You're the grave robber?

526
00:30:21,306 --> 00:30:23,172
But that would mean...

527
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:25,275
- That cop that got killed?
- That -- that pissant Deputy Carl,

528
00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:26,943
he was tailing me.
I had no choice.

529
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:29,145
I had to do it. I had to do it.
You killed someone.

530
00:30:29,147 --> 00:30:31,114
Who had it coming. But it
doesn't matter now anyways.

531
00:30:31,116 --> 00:30:33,416
Baby...

532
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:36,319
We need to leave. Now. Okay?

533
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:39,522
Don't touch me.
Hey!

534
00:30:39,524 --> 00:30:41,224
I'm the one that's
giving you <i>everything</i>

535
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:44,727
that you <i>ever</i> wanted.

536
00:30:44,729 --> 00:30:47,430
So how 'bout you stop
being a bitch, okay?

537
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:49,232
Athena...

538
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:50,767
...you're with me,

539
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,435
and I will <i>always</i>
take care of you

540
00:30:52,437 --> 00:30:54,837
and I will
<i>always</i> protect you.

541
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:57,941
But we need to get the hell
out of Dodge <i>now.</i>

542
00:30:57,943 --> 00:30:59,275
Just get away from me.

543
00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:00,977
Baby. Baby!

544
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:04,647
Damn.

545
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:24,767
Y'all looking for someone?
'Cause I am.

546
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:26,269
Bank in town
just got robbed.

547
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:28,371
Turned into a real
O.K. Corral type of deal.

548
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:30,940
Big old shootout.
I heard about that.

549
00:31:30,942 --> 00:31:34,243
Mm-hmm. Shawnte, the clerk,
recognized the perp's voice.

550
00:31:34,245 --> 00:31:36,312
She said he sounded
just like the fella

551
00:31:36,314 --> 00:31:38,681
that's been dating Athena.
That so?

552
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:40,316
And we got prints back
from the murder.

553
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:42,652
They matched prints
from the bank.

554
00:31:42,654 --> 00:31:44,320
That boy's been busy.

555
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:46,089
I already checked his place.
It's cleaned out,

556
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:48,024
but I figure he ain't goin'
nowhere without his best girl.

557
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:50,126
So that's why I'm here.

558
00:31:50,128 --> 00:31:51,661
Why are <i>you</i> here?

559
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:54,464
Same thing.
Trying to get the bad guy.

560
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:56,299
Where's your badge?

561
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:59,235
I don't need one.

562
00:31:59,237 --> 00:32:00,937
This is family business.

563
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:03,673
Well, I should tell you
I'm not taking him alive.

564
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:05,808
Neither am I.

565
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,844
All right, then.

566
00:32:07,846 --> 00:32:10,279
Uh, aim for the head.

567
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:20,523
?

568
00:32:23,995 --> 00:32:26,663
What the hell?

569
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,333
Come on.

570
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:34,370
?

571
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:39,042
All right, you wait here.

572
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:41,210
I'm-a flush him out.

573
00:32:48,987 --> 00:32:50,620
Aah!

574
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:54,057
Sarge?

575
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:57,293
?

576
00:32:57,295 --> 00:32:59,095
Aw, hell.

577
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,704
Mnh-mnh!
No, I don't wanna -- Okay.

578
00:33:14,045 --> 00:33:15,945
Ugh.

579
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:30,126
Uhh!

580
00:33:30,128 --> 00:33:32,195
Perfect.

581
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:36,132
Yeah. Sure.

582
00:33:36,134 --> 00:33:37,867
Come to Dodge City.

583
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:40,236
We'll have some laughs.

584
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:45,975
Ugh.

585
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:56,953
Jack, you, uh...

586
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:58,755
you okay?

587
00:34:00,091 --> 00:34:04,627
Jack, I've killed people
who didn't deserve it...

588
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:12,435
...my friends --
I've killed people I loved.

589
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:17,840
I wish I could tell you
that it -- that it gets easier,

590
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:20,409
that with time, it hurts less,
but that would be a lie

591
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:23,045
because it --
it never gets easier.

592
00:34:23,047 --> 00:34:25,548
And those moments,
they never stop hurting.

593
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,551
But that doesn't mean
that you should stop fighting.

594
00:34:28,553 --> 00:34:32,789
Doesn't mean that just because
you made a mistake --

595
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:35,591
and that's what this is, Jack.
It's a mistake.

596
00:34:35,593 --> 00:34:38,327
That doesn't mean that
you can't --

597
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:41,330
can't be better, do better.

598
00:34:42,734 --> 00:34:45,334
I believe that.
I have to believe that.

599
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:51,908
And we still believe
in you, Jack. We, uh ---

600
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,543
Stop. Just...

601
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:56,813
<i>Please</i> stop.

602
00:35:09,494 --> 00:35:10,993
Aah!

603
00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:19,468
Hey. Hey.

604
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,470
Hey.

605
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,805
You okay?

606
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:24,574
No.
What the hell is going on?

607
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:28,277
Okay, well, your boyfriend,
uh, is not exactly human.

608
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:31,681
What?

609
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:34,283
Hey. Hey, Sarge.

610
00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:37,520
Hey, hey. Hey, you okay?

611
00:35:37,522 --> 00:35:39,121
Still kickin'.

612
00:35:39,123 --> 00:35:41,090
Okay.

613
00:35:41,092 --> 00:35:42,491
Just barely.

614
00:35:42,493 --> 00:35:44,360
That sumbitch
dragged me down here,

615
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:47,263
tossed me around like
I was a damn rag doll.

616
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:49,198
You got any idea
where he is?

617
00:35:51,102 --> 00:35:52,635
A little bit.

618
00:35:56,374 --> 00:35:59,141
Hands up.

619
00:35:59,143 --> 00:36:04,347
?

620
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:07,183
Oh, I think you heard me.

621
00:36:07,185 --> 00:36:09,719
Raise 'em!

622
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:11,387
High!

623
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:17,927
Attaboy.

624
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:19,862
Dave? Don't.

625
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:23,132
It's okay.
I'm doing this for us, baby.

626
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:24,700
There is no “us.”

627
00:36:24,702 --> 00:36:27,670
Ooh. Ouch.

628
00:36:27,672 --> 00:36:29,739
Breakups can be a bitch.

629
00:36:29,741 --> 00:36:31,941
Shut up.
Or what?

630
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:35,945
Or I'm gonna put a bullet
right between your eyes.

631
00:36:35,947 --> 00:36:38,314
I mean, what'd you think was
gonna happen here?

632
00:36:38,316 --> 00:36:41,817
You come down with no gun.

633
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:45,821
Like it matters anyway.

634
00:36:45,823 --> 00:36:48,491
You ain't fast enough.

635
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:51,961
No, but he is.

636
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:02,838
?

637
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,807
Happy trails, cowboy.

638
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:07,009
?

639
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:12,988
So, you mind telling me

640
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,758
exactly what went on
back there?

641
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,493
Sure.

642
00:37:17,495 --> 00:37:20,029
Guy named Dave killed
your deputy.

643
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:22,965
He tried to kill you,
and you shot him dead.

644
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:25,334
And I was never here.

645
00:37:25,336 --> 00:37:26,735
Fair enough.

646
00:37:26,737 --> 00:37:29,605
And the, uh, security guard
at the bank,

647
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:32,741
Dave killed him, too.

648
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:40,249
Hey.

649
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:41,684
Hey.

650
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:44,954
How'd it go?

651
00:37:44,956 --> 00:37:46,222
Usual.

652
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:48,123
Killed the bad guy,
saved the girl.

653
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:52,194
What about the, uh...

654
00:37:52,196 --> 00:37:54,296
Took care of it.
Good.

655
00:37:54,298 --> 00:37:57,066
Good?

656
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:59,969
How is that good?

657
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:01,937
I killed someone.

658
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:04,106
What was his name? The guard?

659
00:38:04,108 --> 00:38:06,275
Did he have a family?

660
00:38:06,277 --> 00:38:08,143
Jack, don't do this to yourself.
No, did he?

661
00:38:10,281 --> 00:38:12,281
Yes, he did.

662
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:21,657
?

663
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:27,196
Jack, look, this life,
what we do, it's...

664
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:29,498
it's not easy.

665
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,734
And we've all done things
we regret.

666
00:38:31,736 --> 00:38:33,135
Just don't.

667
00:38:33,137 --> 00:38:38,841
?

668
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:41,377
You're afraid of me.

669
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:43,178
Jack, no.

670
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,716
No, maybe you're right.

671
00:38:47,718 --> 00:38:51,487
?

672
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:55,724
Maybe I'm just
another monster.

673
00:38:55,726 --> 00:39:02,331
?

674
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,700
No, you're not.

675
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:09,538
I thought you were.

676
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,041
I did.

677
00:39:12,043 --> 00:39:15,010
But...

678
00:39:15,012 --> 00:39:17,146
Like Sam said,

679
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:18,614
we've all done bad.

680
00:39:18,616 --> 00:39:21,116
We all have blood
on our hands.

681
00:39:21,118 --> 00:39:24,053
So if you're a monster,
we're all monsters.

682
00:39:24,055 --> 00:39:26,622
No, you don't...

683
00:39:26,624 --> 00:39:28,791
Every time I try and do
something good,

684
00:39:28,793 --> 00:39:32,795
people get hurt.

685
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:34,997
I thought
I was getting better.

686
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,433
I'm not...

687
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:42,571
I don't know what I am,

688
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:45,441
but I know I can't make
the world a better place,

689
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:48,477
not like this.

690
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:52,514
I can't even do
one good thing.

691
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:55,050
And I know that if I stay,

692
00:39:55,052 --> 00:39:58,520
I'm gonna hurt you.

693
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:01,256
All of you.

694
00:40:01,258 --> 00:40:04,593
And...I can't.

695
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:08,464
You're all I have.

696
00:40:08,466 --> 00:40:10,933
Jack, listen...
I have to go.

697
00:40:10,935 --> 00:40:12,434
No, Jack.

698
00:40:12,436 --> 00:40:14,403
I'm sorry.

699
00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:21,076
I'm so sorry.

700
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:23,312
Jack.

701
00:40:23,314 --> 00:40:25,714
?

702
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:27,449
Hey.

703
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:32,921
Jack!

704
00:40:32,923 --> 00:40:36,225
?

705
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:38,260
He's gone.

706
00:40:38,262 --> 00:40:41,163
?
