1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,810
Allow me to make
an introduction.

2
00:00:02,811 --> 00:00:06,580
Mr. Ketch, meet
the archangel Gabriel.

3
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:10,150
Mom's trapped
in another reality.

4
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:13,120
We need it, the spell,
to open the rift.

5
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:15,889
We stealth in,
we get Mom, we get Jack.

6
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,724
Boom. Family reunion.

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:21,561
I understand you may need
an archangel for a spell.

8
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:24,731
Let's do this.

9
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:52,125
- Ah.
- Whew.

10
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:55,095
Well...here we are.

11
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,830
Yeah.

12
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:03,437
You do know <i>where</i> we are,
don't you?

13
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,708
Because, not to be a nag,

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,176
but we've only got 24 hours before...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:11,244
Just give me --
give me a minute.

16
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:14,481
...the rift closes.

17
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:17,050
Look, we just got spin-cycled
through space and time, okay?

18
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:18,819
And yes, this is...

19
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:22,055
different than
my last drop-by.

20
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:24,224
And what's
this “we” crap, hmm?

21
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:25,959
You came here
to save yourself, so...

22
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,895
go save yourself
somewhere else.

23
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:32,132
Well, actually,
I thought I could help.

24
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,867
What?
Find the boy.

25
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,937
And your...mother.

26
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:39,940
She's in danger.

27
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:41,742
I owe her that.

28
00:01:41,744 --> 00:01:45,212
You know, she sees you, she'll
probably kill you. Again.

29
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:49,383
Perhaps, but you don't know
where you are

30
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:52,919
or what's out there
or even...

31
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,555
You get the picture.

32
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:59,259
Would having a little bit
of backup really be so bad?

33
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:14,041
Well, this is quite
the vacation spot, isn't it?

34
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:15,575
Yeah. If you had your heart
set on Mai tais,

35
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:18,812
well...sorry.
Hmm.

36
00:02:22,484 --> 00:02:25,085
Down. Down.
Down. Down. Down.

37
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,201
Is this everyone?

38
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,003
Yes, Commander.

39
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:46,506
For high crimes
of fomenting rebellion

40
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:49,076
against the archangel Michael,

41
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:51,378
these humans shall be executed.

42
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:01,288
Freakin' angels.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,294
Not smart.

44
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:25,645
No.

45
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:27,514
Wait.

46
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:30,951
Charlie?

47
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:39,357

49
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:47,734
I know you.

50
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,579
You're not the usual
human scum.

51
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:54,616
Not the slickest hook-up line,
Captain Charm.

52
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:58,019
You're with the Resistance.
Inner circle.

53
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:02,290
She's met with the nephilim
and the other-worlder, Mary.

54
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,592
Michael will want her
at the Northern Camp,

55
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,661
for interrogation.

56
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:11,232
Champ, when the Resistance
crushes you,

57
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:13,468
I'm gonna be there
to shred your feathers

58
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,870
and grind them into dust.

59
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:21,109
Dean...
Looking forward to it.

60
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,219
Dean is in Apocalypse World,
alone?

61
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:33,388
No, he's with Ketch,
so he's not alone.

62
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,456
Because that makes it better.

63
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,326
Cass,
wanted to go solo.

64
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:41,162
- And you let him?
- I...

65
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:43,898
He didn't give me much of
a choice. Anyways, Dean's right.

66
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,434
As long as he's over there,
and we're here,

67
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:48,236
we need to be
taking care of Gabriel,

68
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:51,039
getting him right again.

69
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,245
Gabriel? Yeah.

70
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,984
You didn't tell me
it was this bad.

71
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:05,119
Yeah, well, years
of isolation and torture

72
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:08,189
and Asmodeus
draining his grace.

73
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,158
Come here. Help me out.

74
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:16,464
Hey, Gabriel.

75
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,899
Hey, pal.

76
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,601
- Mm!
- Okay. Oh -- Just...

77
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:22,971
Gonna get ya to bed,
all right?

78
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:26,607
- Let me, uh, help you up.
- It's okay. It's okay.

79
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,745
It's okay.

80
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,348
Gabriel, it's Sam Winchester.

81
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,283
Do you remember me?

82
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,352
I don't think he does.

83
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,488
Remember the video you sent

84
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,024
to my brother Dean Winchester
and me

85
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:45,927
after you...supposedly died?

86
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,664
You told us how to stuff Lucifer
back in the Cage.

87
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,267
Sam, he doesn't...
I know he doesn't.

88
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,003
I'm just...

89
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:57,038
trying to see if anything's
going on in his head.

90
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,942
All right, well...

91
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,749
Gabriel's grace.

92
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:09,717
Ketch brought it.

93
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,753
Maybe if he's juiced up,
it'll help.

94
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,757
All right.

95
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,625
Mnh.

96
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:20,561
Sam, I don't think
he's gonna open up

97
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:21,929
and let the choo-choo in.

98
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:27,702
A technique for feeding
recalcitrant children. And...

99
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:32,040
I think a little coercion
may be necessary.

100
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:38,212
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Whoa!

101
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:39,781
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa!
Aah! Aah!

102
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:41,649
Aah!

103
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:54,162
Where've you been?

104
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,930
Out.

105
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,632
Right. <i>Out.</i>

106
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,635
Look, Jo, uh, you got
a pretty sweet deal going here,

107
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:03,404
so you might wanna...
I don't know, pitch in,

108
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,808
drop the attitude,
stay by my side.

109
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,579
Play strip poker?

110
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:15,516
Shouldn't you be out
doing...kingly things?

111
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,786
Commanding the angels,
inspiring mankind?

112
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:20,721
Stuff?

113
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,725
I'm here, aren't I?

114
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,961
On the throne,

115
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:29,263
available to be worshipped.

116
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:32,967
We came here to change things,
make Heaven better,

117
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:34,702
help the angels...

118
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,138
Dumah.

119
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,140
Perfect timing. Okay,
I have a question for you,

120
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,309
and I want you to be straight
with me. Okay?

121
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,011
Don't you think Jo

122
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:48,316
should show a little bit
more enthusiasm for being...

123
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:51,619
for want of a better word,
First Lady?

124
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,721
Pull her weight?

125
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,089
Little bit?

126
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:56,991
Keep me happy?

127
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:58,993
Little bit?

128
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:03,097
Couples issues aren't my area.

129
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,433
So that's a “yes.” Okay?

130
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:11,672
So you're here with
breaking news about my son. Go.

131
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:14,609
The few angels that we could
spare are scanning the planet,

132
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:16,177
but so far, nothing.

133
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:19,447
Yeah, well, he's a priority,
so...

134
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:23,084
We don't have the manpower.

135
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,922
He's a priority.

136
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:32,560
Of course.

137
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,698
Wow.

138
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,534
They would never treat
my old man that way.

139
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:41,135
<i>Ever.</i>

140
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:45,006
If he said, “Scour the Earth,”
they'd say, “S.O.S. or Brillo?”

141
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,440
Yeah, well, you're not him.

142
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,877
Your father created.
You inherited.

143
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,379
Yeah? Well, <i>I'm</i> the one
on the throne right now,

144
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,881
and y'all are gonna treat me
that way, okay?

145
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:55,716
Uh-huh.

146
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:59,320
Well, before all of us
start treating you like God,

147
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:01,322
you might try acting
like God.

148
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,625
Just a thought.

149
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,433
This is unacceptable.

150
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:15,269
Ketch, who's wily, possible
he could fly under the radar.

151
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:16,971
But the archangel?

152
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,540
The archangel.

153
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:22,743
I should at least
detect a blip.

154
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:24,812
We're connected.

155
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:29,350
You might say
we're blood brothers.

156
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,990
Get.

157
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,975
What's the hold-up?

158
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:57,612
Oh, just practicing stealth.

159
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,747
You know, the art
of infiltrating

160
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:01,916
a hostile
and unfamiliar environment

161
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,252
whilst remaining
undetected.

162
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:06,887
Hence, “free.”
Hence, “effective”"

163
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,558
You, I see, prefer the bull in
a china shop technique.

164
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,059
No, I prefer
the “let's find Charlie

165
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,595
before the angels turn her
inside-out” technique.

166
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:16,464
Remind me again why
we're risking everything

167
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,032
to find this girl?

168
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,736
Because she's seen my mom.
She's seen Jack. We need her.

169
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:23,404
And you're sure that's
what this is about?

170
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,906
You're sure it's not...
personal?

171
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:34,949
We're running out of time.
Let's pick up the pace.

172
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:46,294
Ketch?

173
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:47,995
Come on.

174
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:04,282
Aah!

175
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,110
Oh, you're a strong one!

176
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:09,713
Angels'll pay double for you.

177
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:12,015
Most of the slaves
is a might scrawny.

178
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:16,620
Aah!

179
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:21,458
Where were you going to take him?

180
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,194
You <i>do</i> want to live, yes?

181
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:33,103
You heard him.
Where were you gonna take me?

182
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:34,905
You think I'm gonna tell you?

183
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:36,973
Aah!

184
00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:40,744
Let try that again.

185
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:42,479
The silo.

186
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:45,749
What silo?!
P.O.W. camp.

187
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:48,485
Four, five hours from here.

188
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,153
Follow the road.

189
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:51,655
Okay. Thanks.

190
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,509
Sam!

191
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:25,655
What is this? Is --
Did <i>he</i> do this?

192
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:27,524
Enochian?

193
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:29,159
It's his story.

194
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:32,462
Starts with his death.

195
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:37,200
Or...what appeared
to be his death.

196
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:40,570
“Per usual, my brother had
double my brawn

197
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:42,839
“and half my brains.

198
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:45,742
“He assumed the counterfeit me

199
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:47,344
“was what vanished that night,

200
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:50,513
and he thought that
he'd stabbed the real thing.”

201
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:55,819
“The truth is,

202
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:59,789
“the thing Luci skewered
was a fake.

203
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,258
There are plenty of fakes
to go around.”

204
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:10,467
“Everyone believed
Gabriel was gone.

205
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:12,068
“And suddenly, I was free.

206
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,439
“No obligation
to God or Heaven,

207
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:18,408
“or mankind.

208
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,310
“And so I did
what anyone would do --

209
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:22,312
“I moved to Monte Carlo

210
00:13:22,314 --> 00:13:25,749
and shacked up with
porn stars.”

211
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,818
Well, y--

212
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,388
He goes on and on for quite
a while about porn stars

213
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,823
and, uh...
Cass, please.

214
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:36,726
Okay, so Gabriel was captured,
delivered to Asmodeus.

215
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:39,362
“For years, I knew nothing
but endless torture.”

216
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:44,267
“Asmodeus, once the weakest
of Hell's princes, grew strong

217
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:48,905
by feeding on my grace.”

218
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:54,444
Well, obviously,
his intellect is intact.

219
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:58,548
Yeah. So why isn't he
talking to us?

220
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,384
I don't know.
Maybe he can't.

221
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:04,587
Or maybe
he's choosing not to.

222
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:06,689
Maybe he thinks it's safer
that way.

223
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:18,635
Ready or not, world,

224
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:21,838
New God is open for bidness.

225
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:28,812
All right, children...

226
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:33,483
I shall hear your prayers.

227
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:35,952
<i>- Dear God...</i>
<i>- God, if you're listening...</i>

228
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:41,091
<i>Please, God...</i>

229
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:46,296
Unbelievable. Losers.

230
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:47,964
Whining.

231
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:50,700
I can't believe Pop put up
with it as long as he did.

232
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:52,635
<i>...if you could give me</i>
<i>a sign? I could really use...</i>

233
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:55,738
<i>Let's begin the exorcism.</i>

234
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,907
Vade retro Satana!

235
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:00,210
Nunquam suade nobis vana!

236
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:01,911
Sunt mala quae libas.

237
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:03,847
<i>Ipse venena bibas!</i>

238
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:07,183
<i>Cessa decipere humanas creaturas...</i>

239
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:12,055
<i>eisque aeternae</i>
<i>perditionis venenum propinare!</i>

240
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:14,991
Most glorious
Prince of the Heavenly armies,

241
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:17,494
Saint Michael the Archangel,
defend us!

242
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:23,032
Don't get
holier-than-thou with me, Father Davis.

243
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:26,136
You and your camgirl
addiction.

244
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,743
Begone, Satan!

245
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,948
You shall no more dare
to deceive the human race!

246
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,683
Okay, fellas.

247
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:42,485
Fellas?

248
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:44,587
Oh, crap.

249
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:52,128
Okay, first of all, chill.
Couple things, guys.

250
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,997
Not Satan.

251
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,665
Minor player.

252
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,200
Total nobody,
gettin' a day rate.

253
00:15:57,202 --> 00:16:00,336
Anthony...
what are you doing, man?

254
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:03,239
Just having a little fun.

255
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:04,741
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

256
00:16:04,743 --> 00:16:06,109
Beat it.

257
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:09,679
Get outta here!

258
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,983
Don't come back!

259
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,893
You're welcome.

260
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,428
Who are you?

261
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,964
I'm Lucifer.

262
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:29,532
No.
Yeah.

263
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:33,203
Lucifer is the beast!
The scourge of mankind!

264
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:35,205
Whoa. Ho.

265
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:37,473
Ouch.

266
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:40,143
Yeah, gotta hand it to
the old man. Perfect marketing.

267
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:43,713
Okay, little known factoid --
<i>Pop</i> made me into the fall guy.

268
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:47,417
<i>He</i> made me into
the all-purpose villain.

269
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:50,620
It's sort of worked out okay
because I'm...

270
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:52,956
sort of running Heaven
right now.

271
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,791
Blasphemy!
Blasphemy!

272
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:56,993
- In the holy authority...
- It's a new suit, thank you very much.

273
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,895
...they driven
before the fire...

274
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:00,997
Whoa!
...so the wicked perish --

275
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,032
Relax.
...and deceits of the Devil!

276
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:04,701
Aah!

277
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:09,439
Damn it.

278
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:11,641
That Hunter
may've been a bumpkin,

279
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:14,344
but his weaponry is
cutting-edge.

280
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:17,146
These I don't even recognize.

281
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:20,116
Yeah, that's...

282
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:21,818
Angel-killing bullets.

283
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,586
Might wanna hang on
to those.

284
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:25,021
Mm.

285
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,056
Ah.

286
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:30,093
You don't look good.

287
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:32,362
Yeah, well, you're not
my type, either. I'm fine.

288
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:34,063
We'll take a break.

289
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:36,099
Your wound may be more serious
than we thought.

290
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:38,801
Aw, he barely hit me. Come on,
we don't have time for this.

291
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:41,504
Eh, by all means.

292
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:44,841
What was it with you and this
Earthly “Charlie,” anyway?

293
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:46,109
Old girlfriend?

294
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:49,445
Let me guess --
she broke your heart.

295
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:51,214
Dean.

296
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:55,118
Oh, God, you're burning up.

297
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,819
Let's take a look at that wound.

298
00:17:56,821 --> 00:18:00,690
- No, no, I'm fine. We gotta keep moving.
- Do shut up. Huh?

299
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:09,265
How's it look, Mom?

300
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:19,518
I must reiterate --
it's not possible

301
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,714
for an angel to heal
an archangel.

302
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:26,951
I'm just trying to jolt his mind
into thinking straight.

303
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:34,758
Even then, Sam...

304
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,198
Gabriel...it's --
it's possible that he's lost.

305
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,405
Taro root,

306
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:51,742
trace of arsenic...

307
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:55,512
basidiomycota...

308
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:56,106
and...

309
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:58,130
Why don't you just skip
the birdseed,

310
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:00,017
give me the flask?

311
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,287
Your shortness of breath
and delirium

312
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:05,222
are symptoms of a poison
the Men of Letters use

313
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:07,558
to disable monsters
in the field.

314
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,260
- Of course it is.
- My guess is that the bounty hunter

315
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:12,896
used a similar toxin
to coat his bullets

316
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:16,367
to hobble his prey...

317
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:18,469
at first.

318
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:23,007
What do you mean,
“at first”?

319
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:26,477
Well, if -- if the antidote
isn't administered,

320
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:31,148
then the victim dies
a particularly gruesome death.

321
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,784
You guys are such dicks.

322
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:36,086
Yes. Well...

323
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:37,988
guilty.

324
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,990
Now then...

325
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:41,892
this will smart.

326
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,866
There we are.
Good lad.

327
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:50,300
Good lad.

328
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:51,969
Good lad.

329
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:54,138
Here we go,
just a little more.

330
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,606
Right?

331
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,808
There we are.

332
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:17,327
Gabriel, you have to dig
yourself out of this hole.

333
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:21,932
Look, I know you think
it's safer inside.

334
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:25,836
No more torture. No more pain.
No more expectations.

335
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:29,473
I've been there. You were
nothing like your family.

336
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:32,576
You sure as hell weren't
like your dad. Me either.

337
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:34,278
And just like you,
I got out.

338
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,247
Or I-I <i>thought</i> I got out.

339
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,983
But then...

340
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:44,221
then my family needed me.

341
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:46,723
And this is my life.

342
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:49,393
No matter how many times
I tried to fight it,

343
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:52,529
<i>this</i> is what
I was put here to do.

344
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:56,233
This is where I make the world
a better place.

345
00:20:56,235 --> 00:21:01,038
And sure, yeah, hookers
in Monte Carlo sounds great,

346
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,774
but your family needs you.

347
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:06,543
Jack, your nephew,
needs you.

348
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:09,780
The world needs you.
<i>We</i> need you.

349
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:13,984
Gabriel, <i>I</i> need you.

350
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:18,055
So, please, help us.

351
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,633
Porn stars.

352
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:36,907
They were porn stars, Sam.

353
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:47,551
There you are.

354
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:57,094
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay. okay.

355
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:00,764
This is absurd.

356
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:02,199
You <i>must</i> rest.

357
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,101
Okay, look...

358
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:06,470
I-I'll give you that...

359
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:09,640
anti-poison
merit badge award, okay?

360
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:12,943
I do appreciate it, but...
we're running out of time.

361
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:16,313
So...

362
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:19,917
How about you rest?
I'm gonna keep going.

363
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:25,589
In five minutes.

364
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:28,959
Good plan.

365
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:36,033
Perhaps we can use this moment
to revisit the Charlie issue.

366
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:42,539
Not gonna happen.

367
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,776
To your point, we <i>are</i>
running out of time.

368
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,311
We don't know where
your mother and Jack are.

369
00:22:47,313 --> 00:22:50,013
We don't even know
if we'll find this Charlie.

370
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:53,050
And if we do, a rescue
may be impossible

371
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:55,686
<i>and</i> stupid.

372
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:59,423
I propose we return home,
regroup, reinforce ourselves,

373
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:02,759
and we may have a shot
at saving everyone.

374
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:05,629
All right, look,
I'm gonna...

375
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:08,899
repeat myself.

376
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:14,238
Charlie's not gonna give
the angels what they want.

377
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,707
<i>Your</i> Charlie wouldn't.

378
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,245
They're gonna kill her,
100%,

379
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:22,913
and I'm not...

380
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:28,318
What?

381
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,787
What's the story
you're not telling me?

382
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:38,662
Charlie was like family.

383
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:41,098
She was a sister to me.

384
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:45,869
She did more for me and Sam
than I can even say.

385
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:50,907
And she was...

386
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:52,876
she was butchered.

387
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,347
And we couldn't
get there in time,

388
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:59,983
and I...

389
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:03,553
You feel you failed her.

390
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:06,390
I know I did.

391
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:20,370
That, I understand.

392
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:27,377
Uh, hello?

393
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:30,147
What about your story
you're not telling me?

394
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:36,253
Oh, I've had
many failures...

395
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:40,324
friends and colleagues
who have died on my watch.

396
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:44,661
Only difference is,
I didn't...

397
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:46,630
try to save them.

398
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:52,436
“Duty” and all that...

399
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:56,506
rubbish.

400
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,409
Well, you do suck.

401
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:08,652
What the hell?

402
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:12,689
Perhaps rescuing this Charlie

403
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:16,927
will wash some of the stain
off my hands.

404
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,571
“Impossible and stupid,” huh?

405
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,341
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

406
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:33,710
Come on.

407
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:38,749
One more time.

408
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:43,520
The location and number of
bases the Resistance holds.

409
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:49,326
One more time --

410
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:50,927
bite me.

411
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:55,999
You're trying my patience.

412
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:59,136
Sorry. Sorry.
I'll try harder.

413
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:01,104
Bite me!

414
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:06,643
Aah!

415
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:08,645
This is pointless.

416
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:10,180
She dies.

417
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:28,243
Is it helping?

418
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:29,878
I...I don't know.

419
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:38,053
Hello.
<i>Samuel.</i>

420
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:41,256
<i>I hope you're having</i>
<i>a pleasant day.</i>

421
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:42,824
It's come to my attention
you boys have something

422
00:26:42,826 --> 00:26:45,760
belongs to me,
and I'd like it back.

423
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:47,262
I don't know what
you're talking about.

424
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:49,397
<i>Oh, I believe you do.</i>

425
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,499
And I'm-a give you one chance
to return him to me.

426
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:53,702
No harm, no foul.

427
00:26:53,704 --> 00:26:55,470
I'm hanging up.

428
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:58,139
Do not hang up on me.

429
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:01,409
<i>Gabriel is of no use to you</i>
<i>in his current condition.</i>

430
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,078
Should you choose to resist me,

431
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,679
<i>I will have no choice</i>
<i>but to take him by force.</i>

432
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:06,181
<i>I will reduce you</i>

433
00:27:06,183 --> 00:27:09,050
and that sad little bunker
of yours to ashes.

434
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,321
<i>You got 10 minutes to decide.</i>

435
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,390
Now you can hang up.

436
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:24,866
Nothing in this universe
is worth my time or talent.

437
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:26,368
<i>Nothing.</i>

438
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,269
Humans, angels...

439
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,405
all flawed beyond redemption.

440
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:31,406
Lucifer...

441
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,775
It's all because
of Pop's little...

442
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:37,011
propaganda machine, spewing
poison about me for centuries.

443
00:27:37,013 --> 00:27:38,313
Done.

444
00:27:38,315 --> 00:27:40,382
So you're just giving up?

445
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:43,017
No.

446
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:46,654
No, I'm gonna refocus.

447
00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:50,058
I've come to realize the key
to finding my bliss

448
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,193
is fatherhood.
You.

449
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:53,595
Yeah.
It's obvious, right?

450
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:57,031
I just...I devote myself
to finding Jack.

451
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:58,967
We're gonna combine
our powers.

452
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,703
I'll remake the world
in <i>my</i> image,

453
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:04,406
with pathetic little people
who worship <i>me.</i>

454
00:28:04,408 --> 00:28:07,142
Me. <i>Me.</i>

455
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,944
Love that good plan.
Awesome plan.

456
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:13,915
Finding your bliss?

457
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:16,651
Yeah?

458
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,087
So humans don't like you.

459
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:21,456
Oh, wow. I'm sorry.

460
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:25,427
Instead of bellyaching about it,
why don't you make Heaven right?

461
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:26,995
Make good on your promises.

462
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,396
Make angels.

463
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:30,932
Give the existing ones
their wings back.

464
00:28:30,934 --> 00:28:34,369
Yeah, I-I can't really
do that.

465
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:35,937
What?

466
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:38,473
I lied, so, uh,

467
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:41,342
just keep that to yourself,
though, okay?

468
00:28:43,947 --> 00:28:45,447
So you know --

469
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:48,616
It's not the humans.
It's not the angels.

470
00:28:48,618 --> 00:28:51,553
It's not your father's
propaganda that's killing you.

471
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:53,488
It's your complete failure.

472
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,157
You say you want to find
your son, but you don't.

473
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,559
Not really.

474
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:59,761
So you sit there
because you're afraid.

475
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:01,930
You're afraid of him, afraid
of looking into in his eyes

476
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:05,099
and seeing nothing
but contempt.

477
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:09,237
You can't replace your father.
You can't create anything.

478
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:11,072
You have nothing.

479
00:29:11,074 --> 00:29:13,208
You might as well go back
to the Cage.

480
00:29:35,932 --> 00:29:37,866
And now you don't have me.

481
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:54,549
“Silo.” No, he wasn't kidding.

482
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:57,252
Gratifying.

483
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,720
Now what?

484
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:34,856
The Resistance
will be broken.

485
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:37,358
It <i>is</i> being broken.

486
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:45,433
One by one, your leaders are
being rooted out and destroyed.

487
00:30:46,836 --> 00:30:49,037
Soon, there'll be
none of you left.

488
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,905
No! No!

489
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,075
No!

490
00:30:56,913 --> 00:30:58,646
“For high crimes,

491
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,848
“the prisoner
Charlie Bradbury,

492
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,352
“like all traitors
before her,

493
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:06,387
will be executed”"

494
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,040
All hail Michael.

495
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:51,699
We gotta
get you outta here.

496
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,967
Who the Hell are you?

497
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:56,137
No time!
We gotta go now! Go!

498
00:32:00,977 --> 00:32:03,144
All right, I did what I could
to help the bunker's warding,

499
00:32:03,146 --> 00:32:04,679
but who knows if
it's enough.

500
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:06,147
How's he?

501
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:08,016
I don't know.

502
00:33:28,732 --> 00:33:30,865
Thanks.

503
00:33:36,072 --> 00:33:40,007
Your warding wasn't designed
for the likes of me, Samuel.

504
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,880
I've come to claim
what's mine.

505
00:33:54,924 --> 00:33:58,559
Oh, I missed you, boy.

506
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:01,996
I'm-a have to punish you
rather severely, I'm afraid.

507
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:16,778
And as for you two...

508
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:20,648
Aah!

509
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:31,726
Aah!

510
00:34:36,332 --> 00:34:39,133
Gabriel!
What are you doin', son?

511
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:41,068
You know too well
what I can do to you.

512
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,770
I <i>broke</i> you!

513
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:47,508
You're too weak!

514
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,329
Not anymore.

515
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:11,465
Oh, by the way,

516
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:13,835
I always hated
that dumbass suit.

517
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:44,765
So to recap,
there's another world,

518
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,034
a “better” world,
with no Michael,

519
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:48,669
and it has another me?

520
00:35:48,671 --> 00:35:50,705
Well, had.

521
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:54,392
And you were friends
with her. Me? Her?

522
00:35:54,394 --> 00:35:56,561
Yes. Very.

523
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:59,130
<i>How</i> very?

524
00:35:59,132 --> 00:36:00,865
Well, she was into chicks.

525
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,400
Oh.

526
00:36:02,402 --> 00:36:03,834
I like her.

527
00:36:03,836 --> 00:36:05,236
Look, I know this is
a lot of information,

528
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:07,505
everything I'm telling you,
okay, but...

529
00:36:07,507 --> 00:36:08,973
we're running out
of time here.

530
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,374
I need to know where
the nephilim is -- Jack.

531
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,376
And -- and my mom's
with him, right?

532
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,512
Your mom?
Yes. She's from our world, too.

533
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:17,448
Uh...Last I heard,
they were fighting somewhere

534
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:20,818
in what remains of
Dayton, Ohio, but I don't...

535
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,253
Wait. Your <i>mom?</i>

536
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:23,654
Yeah.

537
00:36:23,656 --> 00:36:26,791
Why would I believe
<i>any</i> of this?

538
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:28,492
Because of that.

539
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,033
Wow.

540
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:37,468
Whoa.

541
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,270
Too much information.

542
00:36:39,272 --> 00:36:43,641
Okay, slow down.
I'm not...processing.

543
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:45,309
And there's more.

544
00:36:45,311 --> 00:36:49,213
Michael wants to come to
this Earth and destroy it,

545
00:36:49,215 --> 00:36:51,949
and we may need your help
to fight him.

546
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:54,285
What?
Yeah.

547
00:36:55,488 --> 00:36:58,022
Welcome to the team.

548
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:00,258
Uh...yeah.

549
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,160
Not so much.

550
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:06,631
I mean, thank you for the rescue

551
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:08,599
and for the redemption arc.

552
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:12,303
But, uh, I'm not really
a team guy,

553
00:37:12,305 --> 00:37:16,007
so...I'm gonna bounce, okay?

554
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:18,042
Um, but, you know,

555
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:19,610
it's been, um...

556
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,612
What's the opposite of fun?

557
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,247
That.

558
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:25,349
No, Gabriel, don't -- you --
you can't just walk away.

559
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:27,318
If Michael comes here,
he will end this world.

560
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,955
And the last time the world was
ending, I put my money on you.

561
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:35,860
I think you can
pull it off again.

562
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:37,628
No.

563
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,866
You cannot turn your back
on your father's creation.

564
00:37:43,536 --> 00:37:45,102
Castiel...

565
00:37:45,104 --> 00:37:49,173
my father turned
his back on <i>his</i> creation.

566
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:52,476
Guess it just runs
in the family.

567
00:37:54,714 --> 00:37:56,414
No, Gabriel, please.

568
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:08,776
Okay. The thing's gonna
be closed any minute.

569
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:11,245
We gotta get a go.
Dean, you need to go through.

570
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,314
Bring back Sam
and your angel and Gabriel

571
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:17,085
and the bloody Navy SEALs,
whatever help you can get.

572
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,887
But I should stay.
Wait. What?

573
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:22,223
If we're going up against
Michael, we need to be ready.

574
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:26,160
We need to know what he's up to,
where your mother and Jack are.

575
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:28,596
I'm staying, too.

576
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,565
Are you kidding?

577
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:32,166
You got Michael and a billion
angels on your ass.

578
00:38:32,168 --> 00:38:34,035
Dude, this is my home.

579
00:38:34,037 --> 00:38:36,037
My friends are here
and they're in trouble.

580
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,839
If you really do have a way
to take down Michael,

581
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:41,242
get back here and do it.

582
00:38:41,244 --> 00:38:44,545
Until then,
this is my fight.

583
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:48,716
I don't wanna lose you
again.

584
00:38:48,718 --> 00:38:51,285
That's not your call.

585
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,990
Dean, it's closing.

586
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,076
Go!

587
00:39:18,715 --> 00:39:21,382
Dean!

588
00:39:21,384 --> 00:39:23,417
Dean! Hey! Hey.

589
00:39:23,419 --> 00:39:24,819
Hey.
You're hurt.

590
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,420
No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

591
00:39:26,422 --> 00:39:28,923
Hey, the -- the --
the rift, it's...

592
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:31,659
Where's Mom? Where's Jack?

593
00:39:34,464 --> 00:39:37,131
Long story --
so Mom and the kid,

594
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:38,900
they're not
with Michael anymore.

595
00:39:38,902 --> 00:39:41,702
Ketch and Charlie are staying
back to try to find them.

596
00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:44,172
There's a Charlie over there.
She kicks ass.

597
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,507
T-- Uh, Charlie...Bradbury?

598
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,476
Yeah.

599
00:39:48,478 --> 00:39:50,211
What's this?
What -- what...

600
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:51,646
What'd I miss?

601
00:39:51,648 --> 00:39:54,982
There was a demon incursion,
led by Asmodeus.

602
00:39:54,984 --> 00:39:56,784
Sorry,
Asmodeus got in here?

603
00:39:56,786 --> 00:39:59,687
Yeah, and -- and --
and Gabriel killed him.

604
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,723
Gabriel? That's great.
So he's back.

605
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:04,759
Where is he?

606
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,095
He just left.

607
00:40:09,265 --> 00:40:12,233
What do you mean, he left?

608
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:13,701
Um...

609
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:18,873
We asked Gabriel
to help us, and then...

610
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,541
then he said “no”"

611
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,177
He doesn't get to
say “no.”

612
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:25,546
We still have his grace,
though, right?

613
00:40:27,951 --> 00:40:29,584
Sam?

614
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:34,989
Uh, we -- we used his grace
to -- to heal him.

615
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:39,293
So it -- it's gone.
It's all gone.

616
00:40:39,295 --> 00:40:42,196
So if it's gone,
then that means

617
00:40:42,198 --> 00:40:45,766
that we can't open
that door again.

618
00:40:45,768 --> 00:40:48,803
If we can't open the door, then
I should've never come back!

619
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,481
Son of a bitch!

620
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:03,251
Every time!

621
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,792
Every time we get close,

622
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:14,462
it always falls apart.

623
00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:17,164
Every freakin' time.

624
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,270
Dean...

625
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:24,772
we will find Gabriel.

626
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:28,042
We will.

627
00:41:33,383 --> 00:41:34,782
We better.
