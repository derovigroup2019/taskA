Dean...

731
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:42,483
you said you'd kill him.

732
00:39:43,753 --> 00:39:45,419
It wasn't exactly like that.

733
00:39:45,421 --> 00:39:48,689
Then how exactly was it?

734
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:51,291
I told him the truth.

735
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:53,994
See, you think you can
use this <i>freak,</i>

736
00:39:53,996 --> 00:39:57,331
but I know how it ends,
and it ends bad.

737
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:00,134
I didn't.
What?

738
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:02,269
I didn't end bad

739
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:04,371
when <i>I</i> was the "freak,"

740
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:06,673
when I was drinking
demon blood.

741
00:40:06,675 --> 00:40:08,175
Come on, man,
that's totally different.

742
00:40:08,177 --> 00:40:11,612
Was it? Because you could've
put a bullet in me.

743
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:17,351
Dad <i>told you</i> to put a bullet
in me, but you didn't.

744
00:40:17,353 --> 00:40:19,920
You saved me.

745
00:40:19,922 --> 00:40:21,755
So help me save him.

746
00:40:21,757 --> 00:40:24,158
You deserved to be saved.
He doesn't.

747
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,260
Yes, he does, Dean.
Of course he does.

748
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:27,795
Look, I know you think
that you can use him

749
00:40:27,797 --> 00:40:30,931
as some sort of
an interdimensional can opener,

750
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:32,299
and that's fine.

751
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:33,834
But don't act like
you care about him,

752
00:40:33,836 --> 00:40:35,969
because you only care about
what he can do for you.

753
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:37,704
So if you wanna pretend,
that's fine.

754
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:41,141
But me? I can hardly
look at the kid.

755
00:40:41,143 --> 00:40:43,243
'Cause when I do, all I see is
everybody we've lost.

756
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:46,947
Mom chose to take that shot
at Lucifer. That is not on Jack.

757
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:48,415
And what about Cass?
What about Cass?

758
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,484
He manipulated him.
He made him promises.

759
00:40:50,486 --> 00:40:53,353
Said "Paradise on Earth,"
and Cass bought it.

760
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:54,888
And you know what
that got him?

761
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,523
It got him dead!

762
00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:59,293
Now you might be able to forget
about that, but I can't!
