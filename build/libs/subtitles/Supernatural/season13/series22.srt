1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:02,712
We must assemble
our most powerful allies

2
00:00:02,713 --> 00:00:05,881
to rescue our family and
confront the archangel Michael.

3
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:08,417
Mom and the kid, they're
not with Michael anymore.

4
00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:11,420
Dean, we're going to
that place.

5
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:13,855
We're gonna save
Jack and Mom, together.

6
00:00:13,857 --> 00:00:16,324
And if we die,
we'll do that together, too.

7
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:18,260
- We need archangel grace.
- No.

8
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:21,129
I don't like it either,
but there is no other way.

9
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:22,664
We need Lucifer.

10
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,199
- Hey, brother.
- Aah!

11
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,734
Bye!

12
00:00:25,736 --> 00:00:29,037
Adligetur fera!

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,039
We got a lot of work to do
back in Apocalypse World,

14
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,974
and not a whole lot of time
to do it.

15
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:36,144
We could use you, not to
just crack the door open,

16
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:38,346
but to keep it open.
So we're gonna drain you,

17
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:40,015
and we're gonna
keep on draining you.

18
00:00:40,017 --> 00:00:42,448
When we get back,
then we'll kill you.

19
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:43,419
Cool.

20
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:47,255
Ow!

21
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:54,012
Aw, Red, you shouldn't have
made me mad.

22
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:55,864
Step into my office.

23
00:00:58,168 --> 00:01:00,936
<i>Defendatur!</i>

24
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:06,108
Bollocks.

25
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,843
Bollocks.

26
00:01:07,845 --> 00:01:09,444
Which way you headed?
North.

27
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:11,379
To Dayton? We'd heard
the rebels, Jack and Mary,

28
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:13,381
set up a satellite colony there,
an outpost.

29
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:15,917
We were crossing north
through the Morehead Tunnel.

30
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:17,919
This tunnel,
is it the only way north?

31
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:19,654
Tunnel's the quickest route.

32
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:28,230
- No!
- Sammy!

33
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:30,098
Dean!

34
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,634
Sam!

35
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:39,074
Dean. Dean.
What?

36
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:42,811
He's gone.
Dean, we can't save him.

37
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:57,425
Boo! Hey, Sammy.

38
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:59,027
You brought me back.
I did.

39
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:01,997
- Why?
- I want what you already have --

40
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,965
a relationship with my son.

41
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:08,870
And you're gonna help me.
And what if I say no?

42
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:11,540
You coming with? Or that?

43
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:15,110
Your move, champ.

44
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:32,894
Sam?

45
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:35,363
What happened?

46
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:38,166
He, uh...

47
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,868
he brought me back.

48
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,304
It's what I do.

49
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,239
It is <i>not</i> what you...

50
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:47,342
How did you get in here?

51
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:50,545
VIP pass.
I'm with the band.

52
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:55,483
Come on, shouldn't you
be thanking me?

53
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:59,154
I-I give Sammy an extra life.

54
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:01,656
Besides, what with my...

55
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,191
little bro here being
a hot mess,

56
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:04,926
I figured you'd need me.

57
00:03:04,928 --> 00:03:07,896
So I'm here to join the team.

58
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:12,267
Your name is Jack.

59
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:13,668
And yours is Lucifer.

60
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,870
No. No, no. No.

61
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:18,406
You don't talk to him.
And you, don't listen to him.

62
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:21,009
Um, don't you think that's
his choice?

63
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,577
No.

64
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,046
Are you trying to keep me
from my son?

65
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:27,616
Well, this is
Kelly Kline's son.

66
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:30,151
He's nothing like you.

67
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:31,853
Don't say
he's nothing like me.

68
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:33,455
I'm the only one
who understands him.

69
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:35,323
This power he has?

70
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:39,094
I'm powerful,
dangerous, ruthless.

71
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:41,763
In the...best sense, though.

72
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,400
No. Kill him.

73
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:51,006
He can't.

74
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:52,707
He's not strong enough.

75
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,276
Dean...

76
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:56,278
- You've got the blade!
- Stop it.

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,080
He's the Devil! Kill him!
Stop it!

81
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:15,930
Way to go, “Dad”!

82
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,267
I'll go look for him.

83
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,836
I don't know understand
all the hostility.

84
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:24,839
You...need...me.

85
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:26,474
I am a walking weapon.

86
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:29,077
I know this Michael.
Heck, I beat him.

87
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,047
So how 'bout
a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T?

88
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:34,182
Hmm.

89
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,687
In case your innate evil

90
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:42,724
overwhelms
this newfound team spirit,

91
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:45,794
you won't mind
wearing these then, will you?

92
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:47,596
You're not at full power.

93
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:49,731
They should hold you.

94
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:54,069
Slap 'em on.

95
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:01,209
So if you're here,
is the rift closed?

96
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:03,145
No, it's open.

97
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:05,547
I left Rowena some grace.

98
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:07,783
So you have...

99
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:09,584
I'm thinkin'...

100
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:12,387
31 hours, give or take?

101
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:39,281
Hey. Listen, I'm sorry
about all this.

102
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:42,350
Are you good?

103
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:45,220
I'm alive. Yeah.

104
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:49,090
Well, then you got nothing
to apologize for.

105
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:59,468
I thought I'd lost you, man.

106
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,147
What are we gonna do
about Lucifer?

107
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,783
I'll handle him.

108
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:16,518
I will, Dean. Let me handle him.

109
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:21,289
Okay.

110
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:33,935
<i>Hi, Jack. I'm your mom.</i>

111
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:38,340
<i>I daydream about...my baby,</i>

112
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:40,308
<i>you.</i>

113
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,345
<i>I wish I could see you grow up.</i>

114
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,183
<i>No one would blame you</i>

115
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:51,019
<i>if one day,</i>
<i>you look for your dad.”</i>

116
00:06:55,158 --> 00:06:58,960
<i>Jack, don't let anyone tell you</i>
<i>who you're supposed to be.</i>

117
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:01,396
<i>You are who you</i> choose <i>to be.</i>

118
00:07:01,398 --> 00:07:03,665
<i>Maybe not worth all this.</i>

119
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,433
<i>Your mom thought you were.</i>

120
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:08,103
<i>So did Cass.</i>

121
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:10,238
<i>So do I.</i>

122
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,108
<i>Aah! Uhh!</i>

123
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,310
<i>Why are you being</i>
<i>so nice to me?</i>

124
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:17,112
<i>Because I know what</i>
<i>it feels like</i>

125
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:19,514
<i>to feel like</i>
<i>you don't belong.</i>

126
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:23,952
<i>No!</i>

127
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:26,054
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Don't!</i>

128
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:47,809
Hey, mama.

129
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:49,210
Miss me?

130
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:51,079
Uhh!

131
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:54,649
- That's a yes?
- Let's go!

132
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:56,084
Nice shot.

133
00:07:56,086 --> 00:07:57,752
Yeah. No kidding.

134
00:07:57,754 --> 00:08:00,522
Hey, um, we really should
go look for Jack

135
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:03,592
and get back home
before it's too late.

136
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:07,896
I, uh...Boys, um...

137
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:11,433
About that...

138
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,173
I'm not going back.

139
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,076
I'm sorry. What?

140
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:24,179
I fought beside these people.

141
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:27,983
I respect them.
I respect their cause.

142
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:29,851
You can't expect me
to just abandon them.

143
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:32,053
No, Mom, that's not --
You heard what Lucifer said.

144
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:33,622
We have 31 hours --

145
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:36,458
I -- Sam...

146
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,126
Dean...

147
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:41,663
I know what you went through
to come find me.

148
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:47,802
But these people
are being slaughtered.

149
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:49,104
They need me here.

150
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:53,975
No, <i>we</i> need you, Mom.
<i>We</i> do.

151
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:55,677
Come on, Cass, old sport.

152
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,679
I am not your sport,

153
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,648
and I will not broker
a relationship

154
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,483
between you and your --

155
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:06,187
Speak of the Not Devil.

156
00:09:08,825 --> 00:09:10,458
Son.

157
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:14,195
It's Jack.

158
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:17,532
Jack, talking with Lucifer,

159
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:19,467
it's -- it's not a good idea.

160
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:22,504
I'm not gonna talk.
I'm gonna listen.

161
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:28,977
He's gonna listen.

162
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:36,651
We have been mopping up
the world for years. <i>Years.</i>

163
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:38,987
We have been knocked down.
We've been possessed.

164
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:42,524
We've lost friends. We've lost
family. We've lost each other.

165
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:44,492
And we never walk away,
ever.

166
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:45,894
And sometimes, we should've,

167
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:48,697
because not every fight
everywhere can be won.

168
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,165
It just can't.

169
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,033
Right? Tell her.

170
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:53,501
I think Mom made up her mind.

171
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:54,936
See?

172
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:56,671
Wait. What?

173
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:59,207
Mom doesn't want to leave
these people.

174
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:03,545
So let's take 'em with us.

175
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:08,016
They'll never leave their home.
They'll never leave their cause.

176
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:09,451
I'm not saying
abandon the fight.

177
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,186
I'm saying we get them
somewhere safe,

178
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:13,054
then we <i>all</i> figure out a way
to take down Michael.

179
00:10:13,056 --> 00:10:16,391
Then once we do, they can
come back and save their world.

180
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,766
You'd do that for them?

181
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:28,703
Well, we got...What, nine
busting out? What's a few more?

182
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:31,106
How many are we talking?

183
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:36,711
25.

184
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:43,384
Jack...

185
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:48,389
Wow.

186
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:50,492
I have been waiting for
this moment for so long,

187
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:53,094
I almost don't know
what to say.

188
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:57,031
This...this dad thing is
sort of new to me.

189
00:10:57,033 --> 00:11:00,368
So, um...

190
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,905
Do -- do you have any questions
that you wanna ask?

191
00:11:03,907 --> 00:11:06,074
Don't let my status
as a legend hold you back.

192
00:11:06,076 --> 00:11:08,777
Now just...fire away.

193
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:11,713
Why does everyone hate you?
Huh.

194
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:13,948
Wow, he just got right to
the -- right to the point.

195
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,583
That's good. That's good.
Good question.

196
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:17,418
Um...

197
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,355
So you've, uh, probably
heard the stories. Right?

198
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:24,993
Anything ugly happens,
any evil befalls the world,

199
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:27,228
it's my fault.

200
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,530
Fake news.

201
00:11:28,532 --> 00:11:31,933
And that's <i>not</i> entirely tr--

202
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:34,869
Well, I mean,
yes, I have done things

203
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:37,438
that I am not
entirely proud of.

204
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,209
I have led the occasional soul
to ruin. This is true.

205
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:43,945
But, Jack, it's because
humans are <i>so</i> messed up.

206
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:46,614
They're -- they're
so willing to be led.

207
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:48,049
My mother was human.

208
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:49,918
Awesome lady. Incorruptible.

209
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,754
Not like that.
You know, great kisser.

210
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:56,157
And, uh, lost
my virginity to her.

211
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,293
No? Too soon?

212
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:00,962
I mean, the point is...

213
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:03,865
humans are not perfect.

214
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:05,533
They are hardwired to fall.

215
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:09,404
And when they do,
they need a fall guy.

216
00:12:09,406 --> 00:12:12,340
That's a vast
oversimplification.

217
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:14,075
Okay, true or false,
Cass --

218
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:16,077
Um, for almost,
like, ever,

219
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,713
I've been locked away
in a Cage?

220
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:23,484
Yes.
True! It's true.

221
00:12:23,486 --> 00:12:25,420
So how did I do
all this evil

222
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:28,022
for all these centuries,
I wonder?

223
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:33,328
Who locked you up?

224
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,764
My dad,
'cause I told the truth.

225
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:40,001
See, he loved humans so much,
he couldn't see their flaws.

226
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:42,770
And I told him about it,
and he got mad.

227
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:44,639
He got --
He felt like I was...

228
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:47,242
personally dumping on
his masterpiece,

229
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:48,943
and so he kicked me out.

230
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,146
No time-out,
no “go in the corner”,

231
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:53,848
you know,
anything like that.

232
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,518
Just...gone, banished.

233
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,290
And yes, as Cass says,
I have done some bad things.

234
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:04,259
I had my reasons,
and I just want

235
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:07,428
the opportunity to
get better.

236
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,365
Doesn't everybody?
Don't you?

237
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:22,110
Okay, well, getting
an extra 25 through that rift,

238
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:24,112
that may not be possible.

239
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:27,849
Cass, hey.
Any update on Jack?

240
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:29,918
- He's back.
- Great. Where is he?

241
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,552
He's with Lucifer.

242
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,123
So I want you to
think about this.

243
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:39,294
Your Grandfather is God.

244
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:40,762
Think about that --

245
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:42,230
Of all the powerful families
in history...

246
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:44,766
Forget the Tudors, Trumps,

247
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:46,434
Jackson Five.

248
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:48,303
We're numero uno.

249
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:51,039
What's he like? God?

250
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,707
Hey! Hey!
Well --

251
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:56,077
I told you no talking!
And I told you no listening.

252
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,745
Dean, he's in chains.

253
00:13:57,747 --> 00:14:00,148
His mouth isn't.
Shoulda gagged him.

254
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,750
No, I need to know about
my powers, my family.

255
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:05,987
Jack, we are your family.

256
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:07,288
We've been protecting you.

257
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,958
We've been honoring
your mother's wishes.

258
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,392
We're your family.

259
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:15,596
Jack, you have no idea
who Lucifer really is.

260
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:17,932
And I never will
unless I talk to him.

261
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:20,468
Jack...
Dean!

262
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,104
He's my father.

263
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,944
We should reach base camp
in a couple of hours.

264
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:37,213
Sam, go back there
and check out

265
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:38,981
what Helter Skelter's sayin'
to the damn kid.

266
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:40,649
Yep.

267
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:46,989
Take it easy on Jack.

268
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:49,191
He's been fighting a war.

269
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:53,095
He's trying so hard
to prove himself, but...

270
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:58,200
he's lost people, friends.

271
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:00,402
He'll take a minute to
get through it.

272
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:06,542
I was just telling my dad that
now that he's here,

273
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:08,744
we have enough power
to kill Michael.

274
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:13,115
Jack, that's not really
the plan.

275
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:14,950
But...

276
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:17,353
this is our chance.

277
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:21,590
Dean, like it or not,
Lucifer is Jack's father.

278
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:23,726
He's going to take
an interest in him.

279
00:15:23,728 --> 00:15:25,161
So what, we're supposed
to just let Lucifer

280
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:26,829
drag him over
to the dark side?

281
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:29,865
Jack isn't going to
the dark side.

282
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,967
He'll see
Lucifer's true nature.

283
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:35,204
And he'll see it
through his own eyes,

284
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:37,773
not yours.

285
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:42,278
Hey. Find him?

286
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,647
No.

287
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:47,750
Gabriel went ahead to scout,
but he should be back by now.

288
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:54,456
- Angels!
- Hey, right there!

289
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,525
Ho! Guns up!

290
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:01,664
Kill them, on my command.

291
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:16,245
Oh, yeah, about the cuffs --

292
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:18,781
I knew they wouldn't hold me
in this world.

293
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:22,918
Long story short, I didn't want
your impotence to get awkward,

294
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,087
so I just went along.

295
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:30,192
You're welcome. Welcome.

296
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:33,896
Right?
Don't...thank me at once.

297
00:16:33,898 --> 00:16:35,598
See? Team player.

298
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:49,912
Creeps me out. You know?

299
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:51,647
Yeah, but it's no Sioux Falls.

300
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,649
Why should it look like
Sioux falls?

301
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:56,752
Uh, just our, uh, our Bobby
back in our world, he, um...

302
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:59,321
He liked to freeze his ass off
every winter?

303
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:02,558
Yeah, well, this Bobby's
gonna pass on that.

304
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,860
Anyhow, it's good
to see you boys again.

305
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:06,929
I knew you couldn't
stay away.

306
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:08,731
Yeah.

307
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:11,600
You know where we can
find Charlie? Or Ketch?

308
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:12,901
Oh, they ain't back yet.

309
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:14,703
They got a tip
on an angel kill squad

310
00:17:14,705 --> 00:17:16,839
lookin' to execute
some, uh, resistance.

311
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:19,308
They went to head 'em off
at the pass.

312
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,976
You let Charlie go with Ketch?

313
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:24,179
<i>She</i> let Ketch come with <i>her.</i>
It's her operation.

314
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,182
Bobby, we're gonna
have to hit the road soon.

315
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:30,486
We're running out of time.
Now about that.

316
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:32,955
Mary said you wanna take
a bunch of our people

317
00:17:32,957 --> 00:17:35,124
back to this “Other Earth?”

318
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:37,693
Yeah. Yeah, that's the idea.

319
00:17:37,695 --> 00:17:40,629
Well, no offense,
but that may be

320
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:45,334
the dumbest friggin' idea
in a landfill of dumb ideas.

321
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,240
So there's Michael,
your other uncle.

322
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:55,577
Sort of a studly type.
You know, warrior guy.

323
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,646
I met Michael here.

324
00:17:57,648 --> 00:17:59,415
He tortured me.

325
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,417
Same.
We owe him one, right?

326
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:03,952
High five.

327
00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:06,789
Right here. Yeah.

328
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,390
That's your Uncle Gabe.

329
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:10,259
We sort of met.

330
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:13,462
Let's go say hi.

331
00:18:13,464 --> 00:18:16,098
So...

332
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,966
thing about Gabe --

333
00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:20,102
class clown.

334
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:22,504
And you're an assclown.

335
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:24,506
Ha! You hear that?
He's such cut-up.

336
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:25,908
I mean, I can't...

337
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,177
Yeah, uh, I guess your time
with Asmodeus

338
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:29,678
didn't do you any favors,
did it, bud?

339
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,214
Well, my time with you
was <i>worse.</i>

340
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:34,149
- You recall --
- I recall, uh, nothing.

341
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:36,085
I don't recall anything at all.
Happy endings.

342
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:39,488
All good, happy ending.
Uh, meet Gabriel, your uncle.

343
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,090
Hello.
Hello.

344
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,293
So I was just shaking up
the old family tree

345
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:46,795
for, uh, young Jack here.

346
00:18:46,797 --> 00:18:49,298
You know, talking about
the good old days.

347
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,834
How tough Pop was.
Right, G?

348
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:53,602
I mean, we -- we butted heads
a lot, you know.

349
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:55,537
But, uh...

350
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,139
you know, I think -- I think,
in hindsight,

351
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:58,807
I should've given him
some slack 'cause, he's, uh...

352
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,242
You know,
being a dad is tough.

353
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:01,910
Okay, you think dad was
a “bad guy,”

354
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:03,612
and you were a victim?

355
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:05,748
You were not a victim.

356
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,750
That was just your excuse.

357
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:10,719
My excuse for what?
For it all, Lucifer.

358
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:12,588
For it all.

359
00:19:17,695 --> 00:19:19,194
For high crimes
against the realm

360
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:22,297
and its exalted ruler, Michael,

361
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,401
the prisoner is
condemned to death.

362
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:27,236
That will do.

363
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:36,145
Easy.

364
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:38,147
We're gonna take you outta here.

365
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:42,317
No, you aren't.

366
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,719
Drop the gun.

367
00:19:45,456 --> 00:19:47,689
You're coming with us.

368
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,538
So let me get this straight.

369
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,541
You want us to follow you
through a magic door

370
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:07,576
that's gonna blast us
the hell outta here

371
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:09,878
and into some kind of
Fairy Tale World

372
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,814
where everything's pretty?
Okay, that -- that's not exactly

373
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:13,949
what I -- what I was
t-trying to say, but...

374
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,886
Andy, look, I get that
you don't know my sons,

375
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:19,621
but you do know me.

376
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:21,523
That world does exist.
Hear them out.

377
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:24,193
No one here is runnin' out
on our buddies,

378
00:20:24,195 --> 00:20:27,329
runnin' out on the fight.
Nobody's saying “run out”"

379
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:32,601
Guys, don't know if you've
noticed, but you're losing.

380
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:36,071
Okay? You're outmanned.
You're outgunned.

381
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:38,040
My brother and I...

382
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:40,209
back home, we're sitting on
the biggest collection

383
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:44,680
of lore and -- and weapons
in <i>our</i> world.

384
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:48,817
Now something in there,

385
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,953
it -- it might be enough
to even the odds.

386
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:54,389
So we find that, then you
come back here with a plan,

387
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:57,526
a plan to beat Michael
and his armies.

388
00:20:57,528 --> 00:20:59,127
And then you win.

389
00:20:59,129 --> 00:21:01,663
Exactly.

390
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:04,299
You may think you don't know us,
but you do.

391
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:06,768
We've <i>been</i> where you are.

392
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,904
Hell, we <i>are</i> you.

393
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:15,677
We'll talk to our people,
take a vote.

394
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,179
That's all we ask you.
Thank you.

395
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:25,787
Just got news about
Charlie and Ketch.

396
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:30,092
Goin' after the execution squad
went sideways.

397
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:34,830
They're the ones who got
ambushed.

398
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:40,936
Where did they hear about
this execution?

399
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:42,704
Aah!

400
00:21:42,706 --> 00:21:45,240
Let's try this again,
shall we?

401
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:46,675
Aah!

402
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:50,746
How many fighters
do you have?

403
00:21:53,384 --> 00:21:55,250
Where's your battalion
based?

404
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:02,624
Are you familiar with
a place called Boardwalk?

405
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:04,159
No.

406
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:06,495
Well, it's very near
Park Place.

407
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:08,397
Go to Oriental Avenue

408
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:10,699
and take the B&O Railroad

409
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:12,768
straight to Hell.

410
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:22,177
Mmm. Mmm.

411
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:24,646
Is that all you've got
to make me talk?

412
00:22:24,648 --> 00:22:27,115
I've sent for an expert
in these matters.

413
00:22:33,424 --> 00:22:36,291
No talking will be required.

414
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:44,933
Good evening, Castiel!

415
00:22:44,935 --> 00:22:47,235
Welcome.

416
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:02,985
What do you want from me?
I didn't do nothing.

417
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:05,221
We're thinking you did.

418
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:10,826
Did you tell Charlie and Ketch
about the angel kill squad?

419
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:15,030
I...

420
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:19,769
Yeah.

421
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:21,637
So you set 'em up.

422
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,975
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

423
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,626
Aah!

424
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:51,333
You wanna try that again?

425
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:55,638
This is stupid.

426
00:23:58,443 --> 00:24:01,644
Dean said to stay behind.

427
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:04,547
Any angels show up,
we gotta defend this place.

428
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,355
It is <i>really</i> killing you,
you're not out there

429
00:24:13,357 --> 00:24:15,791
impressing your kid, huh?

430
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:20,062
Lucifer, do you really see
a version here

431
00:24:20,064 --> 00:24:23,132
where he sticks by you?

432
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:26,435
I think the kid
is pretty blown away

433
00:24:26,437 --> 00:24:28,871
by the old man, so...

434
00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:31,140
Yeah. I do.

435
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:32,575
He's a kid.

436
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:35,444
He likes shiny objects
and magic tricks.

437
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:39,949
But he's not like you.
I can see it in his eyes.

438
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:43,285
His mother's bloodline,
the Winchesters' influence...

439
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:44,720
I can be an influence.

440
00:24:44,722 --> 00:24:48,591
Ugh.
He's not gonna want that.

441
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:52,461
He'll see who...
what you are.

442
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:55,798
I've changed.

443
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:00,169
Dude, it's me.

444
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:02,438
I've known you since
the stars were made.

445
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,772
You can't change.

446
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:07,176
You're incapable of empathy
or love.

447
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:10,579
You live to be worshipped
or feared. Or both.

448
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:13,298
Okay. I-I see that you've --
you've drunk the Kool-Aid.

449
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:14,310
Fine.

450
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:16,334
Oh, is this the part
where you tell me

451
00:25:16,454 --> 00:25:19,421
that, uh, Dad made up all those
so-called lies about you?

452
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:21,257
Got it.
Yeah!

453
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:23,292
Yeah, Pop locked me up, okay?

454
00:25:23,294 --> 00:25:26,595
Don't you get it?

455
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:28,898
Humans were innocent
and beautiful.

456
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,500
But you...
you couldn't stand

457
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:34,770
that the old man loved them
more than he loved you.

458
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:37,339
So you tempted them
and you corrupted them

459
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:40,276
just to prove
how flawed they were.

460
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:41,644
You better be careful, man.

461
00:25:41,646 --> 00:25:44,380
Dad saw that your evil

462
00:25:44,382 --> 00:25:46,582
was like the first few
cells of cancer...

463
00:25:48,753 --> 00:25:50,886
that it would spread like
the disease

464
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:52,888
unless He cut it out.

465
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,658
<i>That</i> is why
he locked you up,

466
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,093
to stop the cancer.

467
00:25:58,095 --> 00:26:01,063
But it was too late then.

468
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:05,367
And guess what?
It's too late for you now.

469
00:26:14,111 --> 00:26:16,612
We've been studying you.

470
00:26:21,018 --> 00:26:22,785
Pure steel.

471
00:26:24,822 --> 00:26:27,957
I haven't seen many
like you.

472
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:32,561
But...

473
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:42,037
But you have to understand

474
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,208
that everyone
has a breaking point.

475
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:53,048
A...point of pain.

476
00:26:56,387 --> 00:27:00,889
Particular
primitive fear, maybe.

477
00:27:00,891 --> 00:27:04,059
But it's a nerve

478
00:27:04,061 --> 00:27:07,930
so...raw

479
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:13,402
that your will doesn't

480
00:27:13,404 --> 00:27:16,605
exist to be factors.

481
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:21,410
And then
all your little secrets,

482
00:27:21,412 --> 00:27:25,414
they flow from your mind

483
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:27,016
to mine...

484
00:27:28,486 --> 00:27:32,955
until your mind

485
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:36,258
no longer exists.

486
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,034
Secure the area!

487
00:27:57,915 --> 00:28:00,382
Aah!

488
00:28:35,052 --> 00:28:38,921
More than one of us.

489
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:40,456
Fascinating.

490
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,791
I've gotten used to it.

491
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,364
I gotcha. Yeah.

492
00:28:55,673 --> 00:28:58,173
Sorry.

493
00:28:59,744 --> 00:29:01,210
Well, hello.

494
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:04,780
You actually saving me?

495
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:07,049
It's about bloody time.

496
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:11,153
You align yourself with
the h-humans.

497
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:15,057
I vastly prefer them
to angels.

498
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,260
Don't think that you are
better than me.

499
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,765
Well, we are the same.

500
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:24,767
Yes.

501
00:29:27,204 --> 00:29:29,538
We are.

502
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:49,025
- Bobby.
- Good work.

503
00:29:49,027 --> 00:29:50,562
Good work.

504
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:53,463
Got a win. Don't get many
these days.

505
00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:55,232
Real proud of you boys.

506
00:29:55,234 --> 00:29:57,768
And got some news.

507
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,804
We took a vote,
see who was idjit enough

508
00:30:00,806 --> 00:30:04,308
to go off to
this “Other Earth” with you.

509
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,376
Yeah? Any takers?

510
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:08,845
Everyone.
I...

511
00:30:08,847 --> 00:30:11,615
Me included.

512
00:30:11,617 --> 00:30:16,053
Whatever reason, I got
a good feeling about you two.

513
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:17,688
Great.

514
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:25,762
Hey.

515
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:27,931
All right, Dean, that's great.

516
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:29,466
How in the hell we gonna
do this?

517
00:30:29,468 --> 00:30:31,234
I mean, we only have
a few hours left, and --

518
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:34,171
Yeah. No, I know.
I-I have no...

519
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:42,245
Bobby? Tell me about the bus.

520
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:06,269
You're gonna
let <i>Lucifer</i> drive?

521
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:07,704
This way,
we know what he's doing,

522
00:31:07,706 --> 00:31:09,406
and Cass
can keep an eye on him.

523
00:31:09,408 --> 00:31:11,074
We're running out of time.

524
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:12,943
Hey, guys, we're down
to 1 hour, 57 minutes.

525
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:15,712
Yeah.
All right.

526
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,423
Jack? Jack.

527
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:29,893
Hey. Where you headed?

528
00:31:29,895 --> 00:31:32,095
Hold up.

529
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:37,000
Before I go, there's
something I have to do,

530
00:31:37,002 --> 00:31:41,104
something I promised myself
I'd do.

531
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:42,939
Kill Michael.

532
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:45,709
Jack, you -- you can't --
Look, we have to...

533
00:31:45,711 --> 00:31:49,079
We have to get
these people to the rift.

534
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:50,996
We'll -- we'll seal Michael up
and leave him here.

535
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,283
<i>No.</i>

536
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:56,653
Look, I've seen what he's done,
the people he's killed.

537
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:58,188
He deserves to be punished.

538
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,857
Yeah, I got this.

539
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:02,325
See, I think what --

540
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:04,928
what Sam is trying to say
in his own...

541
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,897
super simplistic and silly way,

542
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:10,200
is maybe you should
give this a-a rethink.

543
00:32:10,202 --> 00:32:13,036
I mean, I know
I've been encouraging you

544
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:15,472
to take Michael out,
but it ain't easy.

545
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:17,774
I tried it.

546
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:19,309
And if he catches you,

547
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:21,078
then we're all gonna
have to waste a lot of time

548
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,447
trying to rescue you, and...

549
00:32:23,449 --> 00:32:25,982
that puts pretty much everyone
in danger.

550
00:32:28,387 --> 00:32:30,754
Look, I know you feel like
you're doing the right thing,

551
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:33,256
but sometimes, doing
the right thing can go wrong.

552
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:42,099
My father makes a valid point.

553
00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:46,336
Father.

554
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:50,073
Good boy. Wanna come?
Let's do this.

555
00:32:50,075 --> 00:32:52,175
Come on.

556
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:56,213
Kids.
I mean, you just gotta --

557
00:32:56,215 --> 00:32:58,248
you gotta know how to talk
to 'em. You know what I mean?

558
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:57,707
It's closing.

559
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,712
We're running out of time!
Come on!

560
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:14,157
Oh.

561
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:18,995
<i>Koth Munto Nuntox.</i>

562
00:34:18,997 --> 00:34:21,031
<i>Koth Munto Nuntox.</i>

563
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:23,166
<i>Koth Munto Nuntox.</i>

564
00:34:25,137 --> 00:34:28,471
Oh, hell, yeah.
How's that possible?

565
00:34:28,473 --> 00:34:31,208
Lucifer! Let's go!

566
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,580
Let's go. Come on.

567
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:44,654
Hey, come on!

568
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:47,724
Cass, Ketch,
show 'em how its done.

569
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:49,693
Follow me!

570
00:34:49,695 --> 00:34:51,294
Mom, Bobby.

571
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:53,296
Charlie, you're with them.

572
00:34:53,298 --> 00:34:55,832
See you on the other side,
bitches.

573
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:02,939
- Huh.
- Hmm.

574
00:35:08,046 --> 00:35:09,546
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up.

575
00:35:09,548 --> 00:35:11,348
What? I-I wanna be
with my son.

576
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,350
We need you and Gabriel here
in case something goes wrong.

577
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:15,352
Wasn't that the whole point
of you being on the team?

578
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,498
Rowena.

579
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,967
About bloody time!

580
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:35,639
<i>Koth Munto Nuntox!</i>

581
00:35:38,143 --> 00:35:39,743
- All right, let's go.
- Come on. Come on.

582
00:35:39,745 --> 00:35:41,244
Let's go. Single file.

583
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:09,839
Gentlemen.

584
00:36:13,478 --> 00:36:14,945
Lu.

585
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:17,948
You don't <i>really</i> wanna
try this again, do ya?

586
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,684
Um...

587
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:22,085
Yeah.

588
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:42,372
Can it be?

589
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:44,541
Gabriel?

590
00:36:46,545 --> 00:36:49,045
Go. I can buy some time.

591
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:50,547
Gabriel, don't.

592
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:52,515
All I did on Earth was run.

593
00:36:52,517 --> 00:36:53,984
I'm not running anymore.

594
00:36:57,756 --> 00:36:59,656
Go!

595
00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:34,391
- Gabe! No!
- No!

596
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:41,564
Go. Go!

597
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,117
Sam, what are you doing, man?
I'm hurt.

598
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,519
Please.

599
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:04,621
How did you think
this was gonna end?

600
00:38:12,597 --> 00:38:14,764
No. No!

601
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:16,433
No!

602
00:38:30,551 --> 00:38:34,386
It kept closing. I couldn't keep
it open another five seconds.

603
00:38:34,388 --> 00:38:36,722
Well, you did it, Rowena.

604
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:38,090
You got us all here.

605
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,196
We owe you one.

606
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:46,231
Don't think I won't collect.

607
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:51,870
Gabe -- he'd been
on the run for so long...

608
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:54,206
He sacrificed himself.

609
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,775
He's the reason
Sam and me got out.

610
00:38:56,777 --> 00:38:59,411
We owe him everything.

611
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:01,513
What about Lucifer?

612
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:04,083
Sam handled it.

613
00:39:08,689 --> 00:39:10,756
All right, listen up.

614
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:15,527
We made it.

615
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:17,396
Don't know much about
this place,

616
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,999
but it's a place
without Michael,

617
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:22,401
so that's a turn for the better.

618
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:25,571
I don't want none of you
going' soft on me

619
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,906
because we are gonna
get ourselves ready

620
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:29,742
and go back home

621
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:31,977
and set our people free.

622
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:34,146
Yeah!

623
00:39:34,148 --> 00:39:36,915
He's been here for five minutes.
Look who's taken over the joint.

624
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,584
While we celebrating, let's not
forget our brothers and sisters

625
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:40,919
who didn't make it.

626
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:43,355
They will <i>never</i> be forgotten,

627
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:46,525
and <i>we</i> will do right by them.

628
00:39:46,527 --> 00:39:48,260
- Hear, hear!
- Yeah!

629
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:53,132
And now a toast
to our new brothers --

630
00:39:53,134 --> 00:39:55,334
Sam and Dean Winchester.

631
00:39:55,336 --> 00:39:57,936
Thanks, boys.

632
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,772
Welcome to the family.

633
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:02,408
- Sam and Dean!
- Welcome!

634
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:23,362
Why should I trust you?

635
00:40:23,364 --> 00:40:25,931
I saw how they do
the spell.

636
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:27,199
I know what it takes.

637
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:29,268
It's some blood,
some fruit,

638
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,570
a glow-y rock, and then...

639
00:40:31,572 --> 00:40:34,339
Bam. We step through,
both of us.

640
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:37,409
And then?
And then I get my son,

641
00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:40,179
and you get...
Everything else.

642
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:48,854
Are we agreed?
