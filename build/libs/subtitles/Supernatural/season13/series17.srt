00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:03,484
Your Men of Letters,

2
00:00:03,486 --> 00:00:06,320
chroniclers of all that which
man does not understand.

3
00:00:06,322 --> 00:00:09,190
Most are dead or defunct,
but others, I'm not so sure.

4
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:10,858
- What is this?
- Our crest.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,793
The Aquarian Star.

6
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:16,497
This is actually
their lair. We're legacies.

7
00:00:16,499 --> 00:00:19,901
- Ketch.
- Who are you working for?

8
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:21,869
Mr. Ketch...

9
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:26,207
meet the Archangel Gabriel.

Dean?
Yeah?

29
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,480
What are you doing?

30
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:14,482
Nothing.

31
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:16,484
Uh...

32
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:17,952
Whatcha readin'?

33
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:25,626
Well...um...

34
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:28,863
I finally found something
on the Seal of Solomon,

35
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,431
but it -- it's really weird.

36
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:33,601
- Yeah. Hit me!
- All right.

37
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:37,004
“Then Mighty Solomon
commanded unto his priests,

38
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:38,706
“'Bind my seal.'

39
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,509
But the jewel was of
the cosmos.”

40
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:43,944
“Jewel of the cosmos”?
What does that mean?

41
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,213
I don't know.
Maybe a-a meteorite?

42
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:48,716
Mm. Yeah, maybe.

43
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:51,952
Well, forget what it is.
Where the hell would that be?

44
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:54,321
It doesn't say.

45
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:56,957
Okay, so, we've got
blood of a holy man,

46
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,693
we've got fruit from
the Tree of Life,

47
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:02,063
but this piece of Kryptonite,

48
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:04,398
we've been through every book
in this place

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,966
and we got squat.

50
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,601
Yeah.

51
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:13,507
All right. I guess we should
check the archives again.

52
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,309
Great.

53
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,217
All right.

54
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:25,586
I go left, you go right.

55
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,823
I love books.

56
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:41,035
What?

57
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:42,470
Nothing.

58
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:54,215
Pfft.

59
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:06,093
Oh, come on.

60
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:08,596
Are you kidding me? Dean!

61
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:09,930
S-- Hey.

62
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:11,999
Are you serious?
What?

63
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,435
Oh. It's hilarious.
Forget that. Look.

64
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:16,137
The Men of Letters found it.

65
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,172
Solomon's treasure.

66
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,241
Where?

67
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,512
1917, in what is
modern day Israel.

68
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,347
According to this,
they dug it up.

69
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,616
And, uh, here, look at
the, uh, right there.

70
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,386
Uh, “among the items found --

71
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:34,955
a crystal that glowed
with an unearthly light.”

72
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:37,258
That's gotta be the seal, right?
It's gotta be. Where is it?

73
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,059
Uh, uh, it says that
they took it to, uh,

74
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:41,395
Cap-- “Capitalum” Seven
in Portsmouth, Rhode Island.

75
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:42,963
<i>Capitulum</i> Seven.
Yeah.

76
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,483
<i>Capitulum</i> means, uh,
“chapterhouse.”

77
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:45,634
Yeah.

78
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:47,568
So the Men of Letters has --
has only one bunker,

79
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,770
but they have smaller outposts
all over the place.

80
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:51,539
<i>Capitulum</i> One is in Jamestown.

81
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,475
<i>Capitulum</i> Seven, I guess,
is in Portsmouth, Rhode Islandla

82
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:56,477
There it is.

83
00:04:57,847 --> 00:04:59,146
Jinkies.

84
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:04,351
You're gonna stop saying that
eventually, right?

85
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:05,853
I don't know. Probably not.

86
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:07,688
Look...

87
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,123
Let's go!

88
00:05:35,484 --> 00:05:36,917
You sure this is it?

89
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,620
That's what the map says.

90
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:54,401
So where's the door?

91
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:59,039
Dean.

92
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:02,276
Huh.

93
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,180
No way.

94
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:11,185
Ask questions, get answers.

95
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,555
This way.

96
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,473
Looks familiar, huh?

97
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:08,976
Yeah.

98
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:13,314
Except for that.

99
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:14,915
Mm.

100
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,530
Great.

101
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,432
More books.

102
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:33,100
You love books.

103
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:36,103
All right, look for anything
on King Solomon.

104
00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:58,892
Don't know where to start, Dean.

105
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:08,502
Hmm.

106
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,049
No way.

107
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:25,219
Dean?
Hmm?

108
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:26,820
Check this out.

109
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:30,457
Who's there?

110
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:33,160
Help me!

111
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:36,163
Is someone there?!

112
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,498
Hurry!

113
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:45,005
Please! Please!

114
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,874
Hurry!

115
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:02,055
Who are you?

116
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:04,458
We're help to help you.
But...

117
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,861
How long have you
been down here?

118
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,196
I don't know.

119
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,235
You have to get me out of here.

120
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:19,206
Wait. Are you...
are you Sandy Porter?

121
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,774
Born in 1903?

122
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:23,677
Yes.

123
00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:28,315
Thank God you found me.

124
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:36,523
No, no, no, no.
Asmodeus is busy.

125
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:39,059
Then why did he call
for me?

126
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,762
Don't know. Ask him yourself
when he's ready,

127
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:45,766
which he isn't,
because he's busy, so...

128
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,639
Might you have something
to read?

129
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:04,985
That's...not possible.

130
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:08,522
It's true.
Sandy, it's 2018.

131
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,791
You were down there
for almost 100 years.

132
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:12,793
No. You're lying.

133
00:10:12,795 --> 00:10:14,862
Sandy, I know it's a lot
to take in, okay? But...

134
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,764
Well, look, this is --
this what a car looks like now.

135
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,666
Well, they should.

136
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:24,204
This...this is a phone
and a camera

137
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,241
and...everything else.

138
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:30,944
Welcome to the future.

139
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:34,615
Please.

140
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,759
Yeah, no way.
This thing's amazing.

141
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:48,161
Look, you just click on
the kitty video.

142
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:50,030
It loads just like that.

143
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,733
Look! Napping in a sunbeam!

144
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,468
Look at him!
Look at this little guy.

145
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,470
His little hat!

146
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:59,907
Oh, yeah. I love cats.

147
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,443
There we go.

148
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,012
Oh, just a little more.

149
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,032
Bad time?

150
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:35,509
My lord, I...

151
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:37,044
I tried to stop him.

152
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:39,379
Did you now?

153
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:42,349
Look, you called for me.
I came.

154
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:44,117
If you don't need me,
I have --

155
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:47,054
Ketch, Ketch, Ketch.

156
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,459
My boy.

157
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,563
I called you

158
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,399
'cause you work for me.

159
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,869
And I need you
when I need you.

160
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:04,905
That's not our arrangement,

161
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:07,040
and I'm<i> not</i> the help.

162
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,176
This is a freelance contract.

163
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:11,878
So be a good lad...

164
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,714
and wait.

165
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,536
Amy.

166
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:38,772
Hey, Buck. Have you decided
what you want?

167
00:12:38,774 --> 00:12:42,209
Yeah. I'd like to try
something different.

168
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:43,710
Poor Buck.

169
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:45,612
He comes in here
bird-dogging after Amy,

170
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:47,714
and she won't give him
a simple yes or no.

171
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,217
Well, whatever you think, Amy.
I mean, you know better than me.

172
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:51,618
So many.

173
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,353
Still, if Amy don't want any,

174
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,222
I'll go a few rounds
with that boy.

175
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:56,690
Yeah, bring it on.

176
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:02,963
Ohh. I like talking
with you, Marco.

177
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,498
You make me laugh.

178
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:11,838
Sit anywhere you like, hon.

179
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:15,776
Everything's so...
Thanks.

180
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,145
electric.
Yeah.

181
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:45,005
Folks, what'll it be?

182
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:46,840
Uh, well, what's good?

183
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:48,475
Well, people love
the Clam Cakes,

184
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:50,444
but if you ask me,
gotta try the Stuffies.

185
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:52,946
I don't know what Stuffies are.
I'll take two.

186
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:54,314
And the Clam Cakes.

187
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:55,782
Anything to drink?

188
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:59,119
- Uh, water will be great.
- Oh, that's exciting.

189
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:00,821
It comes with a lemon.
You sure you can handle that?

190
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:03,256
How 'bout you, sweetie?

191
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:04,991
Oh, my goodness.
You're all skin and bones.

192
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:07,160
When's the last time
you ate somethin'?

193
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:10,964
You know, let's get her
the, uh, the -- the meat loaf.

194
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:14,768
<i>? But if you'd only</i>
<i>look at me ?</i>

195
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,871
<i>? I'd show you how true</i>
<i>love can be ?</i>

196
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:24,611
Marco?

197
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,979
We got a problem.

198
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:29,449
Yes, we do.
A very big problem.

199
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,005
I don't...

200
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,408
how...

201
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,443
How am I still alive?

202
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,146
Um...

203
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,348
we don't really know yet.

204
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,852
And...and how are you so calm
about the fact that...

205
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,854
I'm still alive?

206
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,092
This kind of weird.
It's sort of our thing.

207
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,095
I-I don't know what that means.

208
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,197
It means we can help you.

209
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,834
We just have to, um...

210
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,502
You know what? Let's start
with the basics.

211
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,038
How did you get down there
in the first place?

212
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,074
I met this man.

213
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,810
He said that he was...

214
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,712
a part of a secret club.

215
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:20,451
I thought he was talking about
a speakeasy or something.

216
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,153
But he called it

217
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,922
Men of...Words?

218
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,257
Men of Letters?
Yes.

219
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,359
How -- how did you know that?

220
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,762
Like I said,
it's sort of our thing.

221
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,997
Wait a second.
So these Men of Letters,

222
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,000
they were the ones who --
who chained you down there?

223
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,603
I think.

224
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,938
I-I...

225
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,175
Sandy, whatever happened
down there,

226
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,344
you're safe now, okay?

227
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,112
We'll protect you.

228
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,848
I promise.

229
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,918
There was chanting...

230
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,121
Insanidox Koth Munto.

231
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,325
<i>Please. Please.</i>

232
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:05,529
And then there was this...
light.

233
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,931
Yokoth! Yokoth!

234
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,468
Yokoth! Yokoth!

235
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,037
Like a...

236
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,840
rip in the air.

237
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,776
And it happened...

238
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,584
They were using me to...

239
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,052
to feed it.

240
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,721
To feed what?

241
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,690
The monster.

242
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,695
Sure I can't get you
any coffee?

243
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,697
Excuse me.

244
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,399
Sweetie, you okay?

245
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,865
Mr. Ketch.

246
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,368
Sorry to keep you waitin'.

247
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,970
Why am I here?

248
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,006
The pieces to a spell.

249
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,442
A real big magic
sort of affair.

250
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,977
I've heard.

251
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,947
Their pet angel was just
in the Holy Land.

252
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,253
You knew and didn't tell me?

253
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,956
You didn't ask.

254
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,192
I shouldn't have to ask.

255
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,362
I was merely gathering
intelligence.

256
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,799
In the future, you let me
fill in the blanks.

257
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,771
The last prophet that
checked out of here

258
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,441
said they was trying to
open up a portal

259
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:01,745
to another, even more
epically messed up world.

260
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,847
To do that, they need
ingredients.

261
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,882
We need to stop 'em.

262
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,485
Ingredients? Such as?

263
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,655
Well, if they got the spell
from the Demon Tablet,

264
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,857
which they did --

265
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:18,095
some blood, few other things,

266
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,198
and a whole mess
of archangel grace.

267
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,933
Ah.

268
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,304
And here you are,
pumping it into your veins.

269
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,642
Everyone needs a little
pick me up from time to time.

270
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,811
But enough about my juice box.

271
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,947
It's time we talk about us.

272
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,783
You see...

273
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,253
I don't believe you understand
the nature of this relationship.

274
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,623
You pay me, I do what
needs to be done.

275
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,358
End of transaction.

276
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,662
Yeah. See, no.

277
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,333
It's more like, I<i> own</i> you.

278
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,870
You don't o--

279
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,439
And it's time
you get in line, boy.

280
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:07,210
If that's how you feel,
I believe I'm done here.

281
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,512
Good day.

282
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,050
Hmm.

283
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:18,722
You're done when I say
you're done.

284
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,297
Ooh.

285
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,837
You're gonna learn, son.

286
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,106
You do<i> what</i> I say...

287
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,711
<i>when</i> I say!

288
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:48,552
And if you ever even<i> think</i>
about sassing me again...

289
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:01,965
Ah. Look what you did
to my suit.

290
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,636
- Okay, what the hell, man?
- I mean...

291
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,071
we tested her
for everything --

292
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,073
holy water, silver,
she passed it all, so...

293
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,442
Yeah, and she's been
down in a basement for 90 years.

294
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,177
How does she look
the way she does?

295
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,079
And this doesn't sound like
the Men of Letters either.

296
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,515
I mean, they're boring. They wear tweed.
They smoke from pipes.

297
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,318
They -- they...
they don't kidnap people.

298
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,953
Except apparently, they did.

299
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,855
Oh, and this, uh, the --
the -- the flash of light

300
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,190
Sandy talks about seeing,
the “rip in the air,”

301
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,759
sounds like --
Like a rift.

302
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,227
So what now? They're opening
doors to different worlds

303
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,195
and -- and Buffalo Billing
chicks?

304
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:36,199
And feeding a monster.
So...not boring after all.

305
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,536
But all the Men of Letters
died 60 years ago.

306
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,611
Longer than that.

307
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,140
So then, who's been
keeping her down there?

308
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,776
You know what? How 'bout this?

309
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,011
You stay here with Sandy.
I'll go back --

310
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,546
No, no, no, no. What?
What?

311
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,014
I'm not gonna let you
go back there by yourself.

312
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,516
- Dean --
- No, this is what we're gonna do.

313
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:53,917
We're gonna find Sandy
a motel room.

314
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,519
We're gonna teach her
how to use the TV.

315
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,687
Well, we're gonna have
to tell her what a TV is.

316
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,523
- And then we're gonna go back together.
- Here we go.

317
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:03,860
Lobster roll, no bun, and kale
salad for you, String Bean.

318
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,896
Kale's a garnish.
It's healthy.

319
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,431
I'm watching my cholesterol,
like<i> you</i> should be.

320
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,802
Yeah, I'm watching
my cholesterol.

321
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,470
Watching it go up.

322
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,807
Well, I guess
I will see you...

323
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,608
later.

324
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,877
All right.

325
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,690
What the hell?

326
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,192
- Clam Cakes.
- Mmm.

327
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,861
Two orders of Stuffies.

328
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,429
See? Garnish.

329
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:43,466
And meat loaf
for our young lady.

330
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:49,606
Hey. Something weird's
going on.

331
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,615
Sam.

332
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,320
Go get Sandy.

333
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,725
Sam? Sam?

334
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,994
Hey. Hey! Hey!

335
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,466
Wait -- wait...

336
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,535
Sandy!

337
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,570
What's going on?
Hey. Wait. Wait. What's...

338
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:23,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

339
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,141
Aah!
Sandy! Come here. Sit down.

340
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,409
Buck!

341
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,140
Ah!

342
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:04,447
- Dean?
- Sammy!

343
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,217
Dean.
Hey! What are you doing?

344
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,248
Sammy!

345
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:04,126
They're still out there.
We gotta call the police.

346
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:07,930
My phone's not working.
They're all dead. Landline, too.

347
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:15,705
Who's that?

348
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:17,673
The police.

349
00:24:22,547 --> 00:24:25,047
What are you doing?

350
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:30,486
They took my brother.
I'm gonna get him back.

351
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:45,401
Who are you?
What do you want?

352
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:48,437
What you stole from us.

353
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:50,806
The monster.
The what?

354
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:53,409
Less a monster, more a god.

355
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:55,578
A...

356
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,313
Wait, what are you
talkin' about?

357
00:24:57,315 --> 00:24:59,115
How'd you find our chapterhouse?

358
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:04,720
My -- my brother and I,
we -- we're, uh...

359
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:07,289
our family was Men of Letters.

360
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,425
So was ours.

361
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:10,760
Kinda.

362
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:12,762
Kinda?

363
00:25:12,764 --> 00:25:16,165
Our great-grandfather,
Diego Avila, was a member.

364
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:19,235
Well, until he --
He went psycho.

365
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:21,103
Jim Jones style.

366
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:22,438
Pretty much.

367
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,374
Diego fought in World War I,
and after that,

368
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:28,310
all he could see was blood
and violence in this world,

369
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:30,312
so he decided to fix it.

370
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:32,982
How?

371
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:35,718
Summon a god from another
dimension and start over.

372
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,754
“Upon us we shall call forth
new gods,

373
00:25:38,756 --> 00:25:40,990
“Yokoth
and her mate Glythur.

374
00:25:40,992 --> 00:25:43,626
“And they will cleanse
this world of hate

375
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:45,261
and bring a new paradise.”

376
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:47,096
They summoned Yokoth, but...

377
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:49,031
didn't exactly bring paradise.

378
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:01,811
It ate Diego and most
everyone else.

379
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:04,713
Then it tried to summon its mate
before they bound it.

380
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:06,982
Men of Letters
disavowed the whole deal.

381
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:08,350
It banned all the survivors,

382
00:26:08,352 --> 00:26:09,919
closed down
the chapterhouse tight.

383
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:13,122
Our grandparents,
our parents,

384
00:26:13,124 --> 00:26:14,757
us,

385
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:17,026
we've been watching over it
ever since.

386
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:19,195
You mean...

387
00:26:19,197 --> 00:26:20,663
Sandy?

388
00:26:40,585 --> 00:26:43,552
You think you're
so high and mighty,

389
00:26:43,554 --> 00:26:47,323
better than the rest of us.

390
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:48,757
But you, Mr. Ketch,

391
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:52,828
you are more wicked
than any demon I know.

392
00:26:54,131 --> 00:26:55,931
I know 'em all.

393
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:58,767
At least I still have
a soul.

394
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:03,739
What you think
that buys you, huh?

395
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:05,207
Souls are messy,

396
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:08,410
all conflict and confusion.

397
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:12,047
Well, I know who I am.

398
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,617
Do you?

399
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:16,852
Because you say you have
this code,

400
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:19,788
this Men of Letters code,

401
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,490
handed down for centuries.

402
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:24,760
But wait. Wait a minute.
You work for<i> me.</i>

403
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:31,700
You act like you're this
cold-blooded killer.

404
00:27:33,004 --> 00:27:37,773
But you know what I see
when I look in your eyes?

405
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:40,209
Fear.

406
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:41,710
And regret.

407
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:43,946
And pain.

408
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:49,585
I see
your chewy middle, boy.

409
00:27:50,888 --> 00:27:54,156
You want redemption,

410
00:27:54,158 --> 00:27:56,258
but you ain't never gonna
get it.

411
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,261
Your kind --<i> our</i> kind --

412
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,664
we can't be redeemed.

413
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:05,267
All we can do is
spread our pain around.

414
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:09,939
So no, you don't know
who you are.

415
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:12,741
But<i> I</i> do.

416
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:15,244
Which is why
no matter where you go,

417
00:28:15,246 --> 00:28:18,881
no matter what you do,

418
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:21,550
you're<i> mine.</i>

419
00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:31,393
Are they gone?

420
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:34,029
Someone -- someone should see
if they're gone.

421
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:41,604
No. No, not happening.

422
00:28:54,652 --> 00:28:56,685
You're trying to tell me
Sandy is a god

423
00:28:56,687 --> 00:28:58,554
from another dimension?

424
00:28:58,556 --> 00:29:00,155
All she wants to do is eat.

425
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:03,158
And breed.
Then why didn't you kill it?

426
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,394
You don't think we've tried?

427
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:06,996
As far as we know,
she can't die.

428
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:09,798
So we have been
keeping her locked up.

429
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,102
Well, that is,
until you came along.

430
00:29:13,104 --> 00:29:16,205
So, you know,
nice work on that one.

431
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:17,740
When we saw what you did,

432
00:29:17,742 --> 00:29:20,009
we knew that we had
to get her back.

433
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:23,312
So Marco slipped something
into your food.

434
00:29:23,314 --> 00:29:25,047
Oh, you don't say.

435
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:29,551
We have been starving Yokoth
for decades, keeping her weak.

436
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:31,887
But if she gets food
in her belly...

437
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:33,689
We're all dead.

438
00:29:53,778 --> 00:29:55,244
Hey.

439
00:30:13,197 --> 00:30:14,630
Sandy?

440
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:25,885
Ohh!

441
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:29,321
Oh.

442
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:38,864
What are you looking at?

443
00:30:38,866 --> 00:30:41,333
If I had half your power,
I'd...

444
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:48,808
In fact...

445
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:54,180
I believe it's time to go.

446
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:02,822
Consider this a rescue.

447
00:31:14,135 --> 00:31:15,701
Come on, you. Come on!

448
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:24,643
Come on.

449
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:27,546
This would all go
so much faster

450
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:29,949
if you just flapped
your bloody wings.

451
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:31,417
What the hell?

452
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:40,226
Where were we?

453
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:47,466
Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

454
00:31:47,468 --> 00:31:50,336
String Bean.
I-I thought you were dead.

455
00:31:50,338 --> 00:31:52,404
No, not yet.
Where's my brother?

456
00:31:52,406 --> 00:31:55,441
He came out
to check on Buck.

457
00:31:55,443 --> 00:31:57,109
It's them.

458
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:58,611
No, take it easy.
They're with us.

459
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:00,513
What?
It's a long story.

460
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:03,549
Oh, no.

461
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:06,852
No, no, no.

462
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:08,721
She got food in her belly.

463
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:12,124
Dean.

464
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:14,360
If she fed on him,
he would be here.

465
00:32:14,362 --> 00:32:17,163
So what, then?
It's like we said --

466
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:19,932
if she's not feeding,
she's breeding.

467
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:31,610
Sandy, what the hell?

468
00:32:31,612 --> 00:32:33,445
Sandy's dead.

469
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:35,381
She's been dead
for a long time.

470
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:38,951
Okay. I'll play.

471
00:32:38,953 --> 00:32:41,053
What's your name?

472
00:32:41,055 --> 00:32:42,555
Yokoth.

473
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:44,790
Star of Madness.

474
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:47,092
Ravager of Galaxies.

475
00:32:47,094 --> 00:32:49,595
Mother of Faceless Hordes.

476
00:32:49,597 --> 00:32:51,764
Cool.

477
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:54,233
Let me guess.
You're not from around here.

478
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:56,735
I'm really not.

479
00:32:58,372 --> 00:33:01,040
When the foolish humans
open the door,

480
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:02,608
they had no idea
what was waiting for them

481
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,343
on the other side.

482
00:33:04,345 --> 00:33:05,911
You mean you?

483
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:07,446
I mean<i> us.</i>

484
00:33:07,448 --> 00:33:09,481
It was supposed to be us.

485
00:33:09,483 --> 00:33:13,519
Glythur and I, together.

486
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:17,990
But my love...They shut the riff
before he could make it through.

487
00:33:17,992 --> 00:33:20,793
Oh, my god. That's tragic.

488
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:23,162
It's like a Hallmark movie.

489
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:24,697
But with tentacles.

490
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:27,299
I like you, Dean.

491
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:29,635
You're strong.

492
00:33:29,637 --> 00:33:32,104
And I enjoy looking at
your face.

493
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:34,940
Whew.
You're making me blush.

494
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:37,443
That's why I'm going
to allow you

495
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:39,278
to be Glythur's host.

496
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,347
Sorry, what?

497
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:42,948
The host?

498
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:46,919
We've consumed
most of our universe,

499
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:48,887
but this one is so full
of...

500
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:51,824
light.

501
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:55,227
And of life.

502
00:33:57,698 --> 00:33:59,198
Y...

503
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,001
And it looks...

504
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:08,274
It looks delicious.

505
00:34:08,276 --> 00:34:10,109
Okay, look, I don't know
what kind of

506
00:34:10,111 --> 00:34:12,511
kinky Gatekeeper-Keymaster thing
you got going on here, but...

507
00:34:12,513 --> 00:34:14,747
I think I'll pass.

508
00:34:14,749 --> 00:34:16,515
Shh.

509
00:34:16,517 --> 00:34:20,452
<i>Insanidox Koth Munto, Glythur!</i>

510
00:34:28,696 --> 00:34:32,998
<i>Insanidox Koth Munto, Glythur!</i>

511
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,946
She has
the Seal of Solomon!

512
00:34:57,425 --> 00:34:58,857
You can't kill me!

513
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:06,231
<i>Panto Koth Munto!</i>

514
00:35:08,102 --> 00:35:10,002
No!

515
00:35:10,004 --> 00:35:12,471
Aah!

516
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:17,543
Aah!

517
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:24,550
Dean.

518
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,990
Glad you could make it.

519
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:34,755
So...
that's why we came.

520
00:35:36,257 --> 00:35:39,992
I mean, we -- we -- we need
the seal to get our family back.

521
00:35:39,994 --> 00:35:41,394
If it could take us somewhere

522
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:43,663
other than, uh,
tentacle porn land --

523
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:45,732
not that there's
anything wrong with that.

524
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:47,400
When you cast a spell,
you need a guide,

525
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:49,302
something that's been
where you need to go.

526
00:35:49,304 --> 00:35:51,370
Got it?
Got it.

527
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:52,972
Careful.

528
00:35:52,974 --> 00:35:56,776
When you open the door, it only
stays open for 24 hours.

529
00:35:56,778 --> 00:36:00,179
And you never know
what's on the other side.

530
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:02,348
Well, whatever it is,
we'll be ready.

531
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,251
I hope you're right.

532
00:36:13,828 --> 00:36:16,229
You sure
you're all right?

533
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:19,465
Considering I was
about three seconds away

534
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:21,134
from being
an interdimensional booty call,

535
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:22,668
yeah,
I'd say I'm all right.

536
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,270
Well...

537
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:29,008
we have the Seal. Right?

538
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,444
So all we need now is
an archangel, and we're set.

539
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:32,912
Sure, that sounds easy.

540
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:35,114
Yeah.

541
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:37,016
- Wait.
- Son of a bitch.

542
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:40,119
I come in peace.

543
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:42,054
Yeah, right.

544
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:44,891
And I brought you a gift.

545
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:50,263
Wait a second. Is that...

546
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:53,466
That Gabriel?

547
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,171
No, no, that's impossible.
He...

548
00:36:58,173 --> 00:37:00,506
He's dead.
We...we saw him die.

549
00:37:00,508 --> 00:37:02,375
Or did you?

550
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:04,343
What did you do to him?

551
00:37:04,345 --> 00:37:06,679
Not me. Asmodeus.

552
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:08,581
The Prince was
holding him prisoner

553
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:11,551
until I liberated
the poor man.

554
00:37:11,553 --> 00:37:13,786
And I understand
you may need

555
00:37:13,788 --> 00:37:17,290
an archangel for a spell,
perhaps.

556
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,627
Well, what luck.

557
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:23,162
We need his grace.

558
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:25,832
No, no, no, no, no.

559
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:28,634
Calm down. Calm down.

560
00:37:28,636 --> 00:37:31,571
Nervy.

561
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:36,209
Here.

562
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:38,110
Take that. And, uh...

563
00:37:38,112 --> 00:37:39,745
Mm.

564
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:45,518
The archangel blade.

565
00:37:48,122 --> 00:37:49,822
Why would you...

566
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,894
What's the catch?
What do you want?

567
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:57,063
Protection.

568
00:37:57,065 --> 00:37:58,497
From Asmodeus.

569
00:37:58,499 --> 00:37:59,899
The one you're working for?

570
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:02,068
<i>Was working for.</i>

571
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,072
But when he finds out that
I stole his prize milk cow,

572
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:11,110
well, I imagine that he'll hunt
me to the ends of the Earth.

573
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:13,746
So...

574
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:16,816
this is the only
safe place I know.

575
00:38:16,818 --> 00:38:19,352
What? Do you think
you're just gonna move in?

576
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:22,355
Dibs on the top bunk?

577
00:38:22,357 --> 00:38:24,123
- No.
- Deal.

578
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,959
What?

579
00:38:26,961 --> 00:38:29,428
I don't know what the hell's
going on here.

580
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,598
But if this helps us get Mom
back, helps us get Jack back,

581
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,502
then...sure.

582
00:38:36,504 --> 00:38:38,938
Whatever you want.

583
00:38:52,787 --> 00:38:56,355
Gabriel...Man,
what happened to you?

584
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:00,593
All right, let's do this.

585
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:05,231
Well,
shouldn't we wait?

586
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:06,666
Wait? Why?

587
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:08,401
We got everything we need.

588
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:09,835
Everything else is just
burning daylight.

589
00:39:09,837 --> 00:39:11,671
Come on.
Let's open this door.

590
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:16,342
All right.

591
00:39:16,344 --> 00:39:17,810
I'll gather my gear.

592
00:39:17,812 --> 00:39:19,845
Uh...hold on.

593
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:23,449
I'm heading in alone.

594
00:39:23,451 --> 00:39:24,984
What?

595
00:39:24,986 --> 00:39:27,453
Look, we got
a busted up archangel here.

596
00:39:27,455 --> 00:39:30,122
And who the hell knows
what else? Okay?

597
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:33,025
Somebody's gotta stay here
just in case.

598
00:39:33,027 --> 00:39:35,628
And I'm coming with you.

599
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:39,432
As I said,
Asmodeus will be hunting me

600
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:40,833
to the ends of the Earth,

601
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:44,136
so it's better if
I'm not on this Earth.

602
00:39:44,138 --> 00:39:45,671
It's not that much better
over there.

603
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:47,540
You know it's
a war zone, right?

604
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:51,110
Won't be my first,
shan't be my last. Hmm?

605
00:39:51,112 --> 00:39:53,112
Fine.

606
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:55,815
Fine?

607
00:39:55,817 --> 00:39:58,951
So you want Ketch to go
and not me?

608
00:39:58,953 --> 00:40:00,386
I don't care if he dies.

609
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:04,123
Hell, I'm kind of
rootin' for it.

610
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,391
Still, you can't --

611
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:07,026
No, I have to.

612
00:40:07,028 --> 00:40:08,728
It takes something
that's been over there before

613
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,731
to open up the right door,
so that's either you or me.

614
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:13,532
So I'm gonna go.

615
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:16,502
And if something happens to me,
if -- if -- if time runs out,

616
00:40:16,504 --> 00:40:18,637
then I need you
to come and save me

617
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:21,407
and save Mom and save
whoever else, okay?

618
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:23,943
It's safer
if we go together.

619
00:40:23,945 --> 00:40:26,846
Oh, there's no such thing as
safer over there. You know that.

620
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:32,084
I know you don't like this,
okay? I don't expect you to.

621
00:40:32,086 --> 00:40:35,121
This is the way it's gonna be.

622
00:40:44,432 --> 00:40:46,298
Something that's been there,
right?

623
00:40:50,872 --> 00:40:53,139
All right.

624
00:40:54,876 --> 00:40:56,809
Remember, it's only 24 hours.

625
00:41:01,883 --> 00:41:04,950
<i>Koth Munto Notox.</i>

626
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:21,567
Okay.
