1
00:00:03,099 --> 00:00:06,000
I saw what happened
before it happened.

2
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,135
Jody, behind you!

3
00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:09,804
How did you...

4
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:11,539
Guess I'm psychic.

5
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,641
Jack is a nephilim.

6
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:15,209
He's Lucifer's son.

7
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:16,777
I know you think
that you can use him

8
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:19,246
as some sort of
an interdimensional can opener,

9
00:00:19,248 --> 00:00:21,515
but I know how this ends,
and it ends bad.

10
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:23,017
You're trying to tell me
that your father

11
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:25,886
never reached out to you?

12
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:27,788
Jack, you all right?

13
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,457
Your daughter is psychic.

14
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:31,588
- Dad? Is it true?
- Yes.

15
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:32,406
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,430
I spent my entire childhood
terrified of monsters.

17
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:35,815
I didn't want that life
for you.

18
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:37,839
Maybe he's right.

19
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:40,267
He is. So if you get a chance
at normal, you take it.

20
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:42,303
You don't have
to listen to him,

21
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:43,938
to either of them if it's not
what you really want.

22
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,473
It's your choice.

23
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:48,142
But if you ever need someone
to talk to, someplace to go,

24
00:00:48,144 --> 00:00:50,811
my door's always open.

25
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:54,348
Look, when we try
to bend the rules,

26
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,217
pretend that the bad guys
aren't so bad,

27
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,018
that's when people that
we care about...

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,487
I love you.
...get hurt.

29
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:03,424
- Mom! Mom! No!
- Aah!

30
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:08,696
And then we end up doing
what we should've done

31
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:10,264
in the first place,
which is end the problem.

32
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:13,334
The "problem" might be
our only shot at saving Mom.

33
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:16,203
Mom's gone.
There's no fixing that.

34
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:18,873
I've only been on Earth
for a few days

35
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,342
and I've already hurt people.

36
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:22,877
No.

37
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,345
I know I should feel bad...
He's dead.

38
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:25,746
...but I don't feel anything.

39
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:27,948
I must be evil, like Lucifer.

40
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,590
Jack!

41
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:38,125
He's gone.

42
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:54,208
<i>?</i>

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,677
That one keeps staring at me.

44
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,580
Well, don't look at it.

45
00:01:59,582 --> 00:02:01,615
I have to go to work.

46
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:04,652
Ah.

47
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:07,388
So who is this buyer anyway?

48
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,490
I don't know.
He e-mailed yesterday.

49
00:02:09,492 --> 00:02:12,326
Must've seen
the "Examiner" piece.

50
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:15,529
Probably just
some gawking <i>Wasi'chu.</i>

51
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:18,732
You know, if studio visits
led to actual sales,

52
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:22,536
I wouldn't be
two months late for rent.

53
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:27,041
Speak of the devil.

54
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:31,745
Hello.

55
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:33,147
Jack.

56
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:35,115
Welcome. Uh, you're...

57
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:36,617
young.

58
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:38,185
I am.

59
00:02:40,022 --> 00:02:43,524
Okay. Uh, well,
I will leave you to it.

60
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,661
Come on in.

61
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:49,163
Yeah, look around.

62
00:02:49,165 --> 00:02:52,099
I work in oil, digital,
whatever suits my subject.

63
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,934
I just started a piece.

64
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:56,503
You're a dreamwalker.

65
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:58,639
Excuse me?
The article.

66
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:01,609
You talked about your process,
your inspiration,

67
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:04,411
how your mind moves
into different worlds.

68
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:08,983
It's just a story,
just for the catalogues.

69
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:11,752
You're Derek Swan, Oglala Sioux,

70
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:14,388
born and raised on
the Pine Ridge Reservation.

71
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,391
I get it.
You read the article.

72
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:21,195
Your father was a medicine man,
and his father before him.

73
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:22,763
Your lineage traces
all the way back

74
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:26,734
to the shaman Black Elk.

75
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:30,537
You can see other worlds.

76
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,873
Look, if you're not
gonna buy...

77
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,276
I want you to do it.
Dreamwalk, for me.

78
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:39,146
That's not gonna happen.

79
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:42,983
I can pay.

80
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:51,492
If I was gonna do this,
<i>if...</i>

81
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:54,695
where do you want me to go?

82
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:57,598
There.

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,933
I want you to go <i>there.</i>

84
00:04:22,124 --> 00:04:24,091
I'm there.

85
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:29,329
This place...

86
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:31,031
is not my favorite.

87
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:34,301
Keep going. You know
what to look for.

88
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:36,403
I see...

89
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:39,339
I see a structure ahead.

90
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:41,075
A fortress.

91
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:42,910
I'm getting closer.

92
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:45,579
This world...

93
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,014
You have to keep going.

94
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:49,850
I'm not strong enough.
I...

95
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:51,351
I-I can't.

96
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:53,921
No. Stay.

97
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,327
I-I see it.

98
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:05,299
I-I see it all. I see...

99
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:17,311
Stop, please!

100
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:20,848
Aah!

101
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:24,251
Derek?

102
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:28,522
Hey, Derek. I'm...home.

103
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,360
Derek, what are you...

104
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:35,229

110
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:57,128
Patience, hey.
This is, uh, Dean Winchester.

111
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,130
Listen, I know that I, uh,

112
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:01,433
told you to avoid this life,

113
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:04,135
but, uh...
me and my brother, we're --

114
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:05,570
we're looking for someone.

115
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:07,272
And we put an APB out
with every Hunter we know,

116
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:09,975
and...nothin'.

117
00:06:09,977 --> 00:06:11,843
We really could use
a psychic's help on this.

118
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:15,447
So...if you could call me back.
Thanks.

119
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:18,149
Any word from Cass?

120
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:20,418
Yeah. Uh, he says
he's still looking for Jack,

121
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,886
working a lead in Tucson.

122
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:27,025
Hmm.

123
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:29,561
Hi, Jody.

124
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:30,829
Hi, Jody. What's going on?

125
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,731
<i>Hey, boys.</i>
<i>I got something for ya.</i>

126
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,533
Friend of mine from Bismarck PD
called with a lead.

127
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:38,837
He said that a local artist
was found dead

128
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,439
<i>with his eyes burned out.</i>

129
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,309
Sounds angel-y.

130
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:45,643
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought,</i>

131
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:47,345
<i>except for that</i>
<i>there was a witness --</i>

132
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:49,748
the victim's girlfriend.
She pegged someone at the scene.

133
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,717
She gave the police
a description.

134
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,686
I think it's your boy.

135
00:06:56,123 --> 00:07:00,525
?

136
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:02,594
Patience?

137
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,396
I'll be down in a minute.

138
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:08,500
?

139
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,370
Mr. Caruthers called.

140
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:14,072
Great.

141
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:20,512
It's one test.

142
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:24,082
So I got a C.
Not like I flunked.

143
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:25,950
So is that
the new standard?

144
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:28,753
Passing?

145
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:31,956
Baby, you know the plan --
perfect S.A.T.s, perfect G.P.A.,

146
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,458
and you got your pick
of the Ivies.

147
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,126
You got twice the mind
I do.

148
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:36,594
You stay focused, there's
nothing you can't have,

149
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:38,797
nothing you can't do.

150
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,833
I can think of one thing.
What?

151
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,441
Dean Winchester called me today.

152
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:52,077
The Hunter?

153
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:57,449
Why?

154
00:07:57,451 --> 00:08:01,519
He and his brother
want my help.

155
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,223
Psychic help.

156
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:08,126
And what'd you say?

157
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:11,096
Nothing. I didn't answer.

158
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:16,901
Patience,
what's going on?

159
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:19,471
Everything is working,
isn't it?

160
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:22,073
No visions?

161
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:23,741
Right?

162
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:27,512
Right.

163
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:37,789
?

164
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:49,567
?

165
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:58,977
?

166
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,411
That's him.

167
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:03,414
He said his name was Jack,
that he was a buyer.

168
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:07,252
Um...a buyer?

169
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:08,753
Ah.

170
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:11,156
Some freaky stuff here.

171
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:13,558
Derek had quite the imagination.

172
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,059
He hated that word.

173
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:16,628
What? "Freaky"?

174
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,863
"Imagination."

175
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:22,066
He liked to think of his art
more as reportage.

176
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:25,069
Reportage?

177
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:28,072
Reportage from where?

178
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:30,341
From the places he'd visit.

179
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:32,510
Derek was a dreamwalker.

180
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,949
Sam?

181
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:47,225
?

182
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:56,801
?

183
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:58,503
Hey.

184
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:00,038
Thanks.
Yeah.

185
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,541
So the lore on dreamwalking
is pretty inconsistent.

186
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:05,743
Uh, there are stories about it
across numerous Native Amer--

187
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:08,346
Sam,
we gonna talk about it?

188
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,848
What?
You saw that painting.

189
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:16,654
Yeah.
And?

190
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:18,389
Well, it looks like
Jack gave up on us

191
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:20,291
and he's looking for Daddy.
Dean, we don't know that.

192
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:22,293
Don't we? A guy is dead.

193
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:25,029
Look, I hate this, too,
but we've gotta be prepared.

194
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,932
To kill him.

195
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:32,604
Look, this isn't
an "I told you so."

196
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:34,038
Okay? I mean...

197
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
I actually like the kid.
I do.

198
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,409
But, I mean, we're in
worst-case scenario land here.

199
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:42,080
Yeah, but, Dean,
we need more information.

200
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:44,682
I mean... we gotta
figure out what Jack wanted,

201
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:47,952
how -- how dreamwalking
even works.

202
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:51,055
Okay, well, then let's go
to a reservation.

203
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:53,858
Let's talk to a-a chief
or a tribal leader.

204
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,761
Or we talk
to a dreamwalker.

205
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:01,299
I hacked into Derek's e-mail.

206
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:03,001
He's been corresponding with
another dreamwalker for months,

207
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:06,104
a girl named Kaia Nieves.

208
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:07,538
He had been trying
to coach her

209
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,907
to teach her
to control her power.

210
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:13,044
All right. Where is she?

211
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:15,546
I-I would've sold
my son for another hit.

212
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:19,584
I know if I wasn't here,
I-I probably still would.

213
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:21,753
That's excellent
sharing, Frankie.

214
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:23,621
Kaia?

215
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:26,758
Would you like to share
with the group today?

216
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,726
Not much to say, you know.

217
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:30,228
Just...

218
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,531
One day at a time.
Every day's a gift.

219
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,234
Like the kitten poster says,
"Hang in there, baby."

220
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:38,369
And the, uh,
the incident --

221
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:41,306
are you ready to discuss that?
No.

222
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:43,241
Kaia, you overdosed.

223
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,677
You were found unconscious
in an abandoned tenement

224
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,545
with enough prescription
amphetamine in your system

225
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:49,347
to kill a small rhino,

226
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:51,582
not to mention the stolen pills
the police found in your bag.

227
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,484
I didn't steal them.
I bought them.

228
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:54,986
Yeah, from a dealer.
I don't know.

229
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:56,387
I like to think of him
as a small businessman

230
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:59,590
just trying to make it
in Trump's America.

231
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:02,927
The court
sent you here to get better,

232
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,195
but if you don't wanna talk
about this, then we can't --

233
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:06,864
I <i>am</i> talking about it. See?

234
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:09,867
Lips? Moving?

235
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:15,306
Let's talk about
your scars.

236
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:18,343
Pass.
Kaia.

237
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:20,278
Look, I know you're just trying
to do your job or whatever,

238
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,947
but please stop.

239
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:25,183
You don't know anything
about me.

240
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:26,684
I know you need help.

241
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:28,753
I don't. I...

242
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:32,523
I don't...
I don't belong here.

243
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:34,092
I'm not an addict.

244
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:39,130
We've all been exactly
where you are, Kaia,

245
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,165
denying the truth of
our situation.

246
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:44,168
I hate doing this to myself,
putting that junk in my body,

247
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,837
but it's the only thing
that keeps me awake.

248
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,706
It's the only thing that...

249
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,341
that keeps me from...

250
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:52,243
from the Bad Place.

251
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:59,317
?

252
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:02,120
Yes, we've all...

253
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:04,622
we all have our "bad places,"
don't we?

254
00:13:04,624 --> 00:13:06,624
The stuff
we're running from,

255
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:10,828
the things that we try to
blot out with drugs or drink.

256
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,598
But we have to face it
eventually, don't we?

257
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,773
Hey.

258
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:23,441
Hey, there.

259
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:27,345
I'm Jack.

260
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:30,681
?

261
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,875
Hi, Jack. You're new.

262
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:37,910
Yes. I am.

263
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:39,745
So what's your poison?

264
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:43,916
Why are you here?

265
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:45,718
I like...

266
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,186
cocaine.

267
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:49,722
<i>Okay,</i> Suite Life.

268
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:51,290
Well, I don't know why
you're really here,

269
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,025
but you're gonna have to find
a new day one buddy

270
00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:56,128
'cause it's not really
my thing.

271
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,698
I know who you are, Kaia.

272
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,334
I'm a...friend of Derek's.

273
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:04,537
He told me about you,
said you were like him.

274
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:09,075
A dreamwalker.

275
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:10,576
What?
He said you were

276
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:12,611
the most powerful one
he'd ever known.

277
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:14,347
And I need your help.

278
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:15,948
Look, I-I don't know what
you think you know

279
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,752
about dreamwalking --
And I can help you.

280
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,287
I can get you out of here.

281
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:23,856
How?
Follow me.

282
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:33,966
?

283
00:14:36,738 --> 00:14:38,838
So...

284
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,606
Kaia never knew her father.

285
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:42,942
Her mom died in an accident
when she was 12,

286
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:45,611
so her aunt took her in,
and then <i>she</i> died -- cancer.

287
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:46,446
Damn.

288
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,881
Yeah, been on her own
ever since,

289
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:50,416
until her O.D. and arrest.

290
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:51,817
Bad hand.
Yeah.

291
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:54,286
No wonder
she ended up here.

292
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:59,191
?

293
00:14:59,193 --> 00:15:01,560
Kaia, where you going?
Keep walking.

294
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,028
Hey, you're not allowed
to be in here.

295
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,733
- What did you do?
- Don't worry. He's just sleeping.

296
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:11,470
You're not the only one
with powers.

297
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:17,209
?

298
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:22,314
That door was triple-locked.

299
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:24,049
Was it?

300
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:25,618
What are you?

301
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,586
That's a long story. This way.

302
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:29,121
Yeah, no.

303
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:30,990
What?

304
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:32,958
Look, thanks for the jail break
and all, but I don't know you,

305
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,860
and I don't know what the hell's
going on, so I'm out.

306
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:37,129
No, we had a deal.

307
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,497
You said you'd get me out.
That's the deal I heard.

308
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,199
You can't.
Watch me.

309
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:42,101
No.

310
00:15:42,103 --> 00:15:44,336
You <i>will</i> help me.

311
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:46,071
-Jack!
-Sam?

312
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:53,045
She hit me.

313
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:55,047
Yeah, good.
No, she's getting away. I --

314
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:56,582
No, no, no, no, no.
She can't --

315
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:58,217
Hey, we're not
letting you near her

316
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:00,286
until you tell us what's going on.
No, I need her.

317
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:01,427
You need her
like you needed Derek?

318
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:03,451
Yes.

319
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,157
You...

320
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,393
You don't...

321
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:10,529
I'm -- I'm doing this for <i>you.</i>

322
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:11,964
Oh, you killed Derek
for us?

323
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:13,599
Derek's dead?

324
00:16:16,404 --> 00:16:19,738
Wait, hold on a second.
Jack, tell us what happened.

325
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,073
Everything.

326
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:23,809
I left to try to get a grip
on my powers.

327
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:26,479
I wanted to prove to you
that I'm good,

328
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:30,216
to do one good thing.

329
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:33,486
So I did the thing
you wanted the most.

330
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:36,555
I experimented,
opening doors to other worlds.

331
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:39,859
I could almost do it.
I could get right to the edge.

332
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:42,928
But I couldn't see. I could only
feel around in the dark.

333
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,131
I needed eyes. A seer.

334
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:47,633
A dreamwalker.

335
00:16:47,635 --> 00:16:49,668
Yeah.

336
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,471
So I researched,
like you taught me.

337
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:54,073
That's how I found Derek.

338
00:16:54,075 --> 00:16:56,275
?

339
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:58,210
Hello.

340
00:16:58,212 --> 00:17:01,046
<i>I didn't know if it would work,</i>

341
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:02,882
<i>but it did.</i>

342
00:17:02,884 --> 00:17:06,519
<i>He dreamwalked,</i>
<i>and I joined him...</i>

343
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:10,155
<i>...in apocalypse world.</i>

344
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:17,263
<i>I could see what he saw.</i>

345
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:23,936
?

346
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:27,306
<i>And I saw...</i>

347
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:31,243
?

348
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:33,579
No. I-I'm -- I'm sorry.

349
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:35,714
I-I didn't mean to...

350
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:38,317
And I saw <i>her.</i>
Her?

351
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,352
Your mother.

352
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,823
She's alive.
What?

353
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:46,225
But she's in danger.

354
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:48,127
W-what does that mean?
What -- what kind of danger?

355
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:49,795
It's easier if I show you.

356
00:17:49,797 --> 00:17:53,265
?

357
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:54,733
Wh--

358
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:56,235
Dean.

359
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:06,312
?

360
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:17,022
?

361
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:22,094
<i>Help.</i>

362
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,900
<i>Help.</i>

363
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:35,007
<i>Help!</i>

364
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:36,508
?

365
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,745
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

366
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:44,350
Mom.

367
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:46,518
I was so close to her,
I could've touched her.

368
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,854
But Derek wasn't strong enough
to hold the connection.

369
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:50,222
Wait,
you didn't burn him out?

370
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:52,091
No. I stopped.

371
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:55,127
Derek, he wasn't strong enough,
but he knew someone who was.

372
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:56,595
Kaia, she's the key.

373
00:19:08,376 --> 00:19:10,976
Where you headed, Miss?
Anywhere.

374
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:13,646
Let me help you.
Door's a little...hinky.

375
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:16,515
That's it.

376
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:19,351
Uhh!

377
00:19:19,353 --> 00:19:22,988
?

378
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:31,363
?

379
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:43,659
?

380
00:19:43,895 --> 00:19:48,531
?

381
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:57,707
Hey, get movin'!
Come on!

382
00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:05,348
?

383
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:18,894
We want Jack.

384
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:21,397
Cocaine boy?

385
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:23,399
The Son of Lucifer.

386
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:25,234
What?

387
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:27,036
We tracked him to Derek,

388
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:29,772
but the artist was
uncooperative.

389
00:20:29,774 --> 00:20:31,340
We tortured him.

390
00:20:31,342 --> 00:20:34,510
Eventually, he told us where
Jack was headed -- to you.

391
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:36,345
Then we killed him.

392
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:38,481
Due diligence
covering our tracks,

393
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:41,984
yet the Winchesters got
involved anyway, as they do.

394
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:45,388
So we needed
a new strategy.

395
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:48,991
We needed bait.

396
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:52,495
Yep, all right. Thank you.

397
00:20:52,497 --> 00:20:54,397
Cops are looking for Kaia, too.

398
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,233
We gotta find her fast.

399
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,068
You were right.

400
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,870
About Mom. You were right.

401
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:03,606
This whole time, we should've
been looking for her.

402
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:06,976
Dean, I was just hoping.
I didn't know.

403
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:09,178
Anyways, it doesn't matter.
Now that we do know --

404
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,081
We find her,
no matter what it takes.

405
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,917
Yep.

406
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:18,521
Kid, you okay?

407
00:21:21,793 --> 00:21:23,392
Jack?

408
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:25,694
You thought...

409
00:21:25,696 --> 00:21:29,765
You <i>both</i> thought
that I could do that,

410
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:31,967
that I could kill Derek.

411
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:36,138
Jack, we, um...

412
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:41,844
We didn't know
what happened.

413
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:45,614
We figured, m-maybe it was
an accident or -- or...

414
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:47,483
Like the security guard.

415
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:51,287
Yes. Exactly. Like that.

416
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,856
Jack, we were worried,
okay?

417
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:56,459
You know, when you disappeared,
you were in a dark place.

418
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:58,961
And we didn't know where
you were going and...

419
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:00,696
Thought you were looking
for your dad.

420
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:04,533
?

421
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:06,469
You mean Lucifer?

422
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:09,071
Mm.
Yeah.

423
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:12,041
I was scared. I was upset.

424
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:14,043
But...why would I look for him?

425
00:22:14,045 --> 00:22:16,445
He's no one to me.

426
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:20,115
You, Castiel --

427
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:22,985
you're my family.

428
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:25,554
?

429
00:22:25,556 --> 00:22:29,358
Yes, we are.

430
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,428
Finding Mom, you...

431
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,764
You did a good thing, kid.
You did a real good thing.

432
00:22:43,975 --> 00:22:45,875
Ah!
Jack?

433
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:48,244
That...

434
00:22:48,246 --> 00:22:49,745
It was angel radio.

435
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:51,747
They've got Kaia.

436
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:57,186
What about school?

437
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:59,788
I'll miss a few days.
No big deal.

438
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:03,359
Patience...

439
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:04,894
Someone...

440
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:06,829
A friend's in danger.

441
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:09,632
They're <i>going</i> to be
in danger.

442
00:23:10,902 --> 00:23:12,568
You had a vision.

443
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:18,240
They never stopped.

444
00:23:20,945 --> 00:23:23,479
I see things
before they happen.

445
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:27,016
Usually small things --
a conversation,

446
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:29,518
what someone will
be wearing the next day.

447
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,156
I tried pushing them down,
ignoring them. But now?

448
00:23:34,158 --> 00:23:36,892
I can't.

449
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:39,194
Dad...

450
00:23:39,196 --> 00:23:42,398
<i>this</i> is who I am.
No.

451
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,767
If you get involved
in that...

452
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:47,570
Look, I was wrong to lie
about Grandma.

453
00:23:47,572 --> 00:23:50,806
But you know what
happened to her.

454
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:53,142
?

455
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:56,111
You raised me to do
what's right,

456
00:23:56,113 --> 00:23:58,614
and this is what's right.

457
00:23:58,616 --> 00:24:01,984
If I don't go,
people will die.

458
00:24:01,986 --> 00:24:10,259
?

459
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:12,795
Patience, don't.

460
00:24:12,797 --> 00:24:16,699
You go now,
you choose that life,

461
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:18,334
you don't come back.

462
00:24:18,336 --> 00:24:28,611
?

463
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:38,187
?

464
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:40,723
Your plan? It sucks.

465
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:42,027
They won't come for me.

466
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:42,712
What do you mean?

467
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:44,736
I mean, you picked
the wrong bait.

468
00:24:44,962 --> 00:24:47,429
I'm not the kind of girl
folks come for.

469
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:49,898
In this world, I don't even
rank a milk carton.

470
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,900
No one is gonna
come for me.

471
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:56,238
I'm not white, rich,
blonde.

472
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,741
No one's gonna fight for me.
I don't matter.

473
00:24:58,743 --> 00:25:02,044
Of course
you don't matter.

474
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:05,014
But they think you do.
They'll show.

475
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:06,448
And when they do,

476
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,851
we'll kill them
and take the boy.

477
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:10,319
That so?

478
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:13,355
You know, the girl's right.

479
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:15,190
Your plan does kind of suck.

480
00:25:15,192 --> 00:25:18,093
Give us the girl.

481
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:20,262
She's not what we want.

482
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:22,564
Jack, I don't wanna
hurt you.

483
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:24,033
I wanna help you.

484
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:25,834
You should be among
your own kind.

485
00:25:25,836 --> 00:25:27,436
My kind?

486
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:29,571
The kind that kills people?

487
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:30,973
That kidnaps people?

488
00:25:30,975 --> 00:25:32,708
You don't belong
with them.

489
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,811
Come with us. Come home.

490
00:25:35,813 --> 00:25:41,050
?

491
00:25:41,052 --> 00:25:42,584
I am home.

492
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:45,654
?

493
00:25:47,124 --> 00:25:56,932
?

494
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:01,704
Aah!

495
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:16,452
?

496
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:22,024
?

497
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:33,402
- I got her.
- Are you okay?

498
00:26:33,404 --> 00:26:35,604
No!
What the hell was that?!

499
00:26:35,606 --> 00:26:37,773
They were angels.
Bad angels.

500
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:39,274
Angels?

501
00:26:39,276 --> 00:26:41,443
Yes, and we're Hunters.
We kill things like them.

502
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:43,445
Right.
And he's the Son of Satan?

503
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:47,449
I am. Yes.

504
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:49,384
You're insane.

505
00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:53,055
Yeah, the whole world's insane.
You get used to it.

506
00:26:53,057 --> 00:26:55,424
She took off. She might be back,
she might not.

507
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:56,825
Yeah, we should move.

508
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,264
We'll protect you.
I don't think so.

509
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:06,301
Wait. Hey, hey. Kaia, look,
I'm sure this is a lot.

510
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:08,203
But...

511
00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:10,372
Look, we need you. Okay?
My brother and I,

512
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:12,074
our -- our mother is
trapped in -- in another world,

513
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:15,978
and -- and if you can
tell Jack where it is,

514
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,546
then he can open a door --

515
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:20,716
And we can save her.

516
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:26,054
So what's the play?

517
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:28,290
Derek said there are
sacred sites,

518
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:30,859
places where the walls
between worlds are thin,

519
00:27:30,861 --> 00:27:32,528
where it's easy to
cross over.

520
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,496
I was taking Kaia
to the Wind Caves.

521
00:27:34,498 --> 00:27:36,999
The Wind Caves?

522
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:39,234
- Let's roll.
- No.

523
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:41,937
We just saved your life
in there.

524
00:27:41,939 --> 00:27:45,107
Thanks, but they only wanted me
because of you.

525
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:49,978
Kaia, we need you
to dreamwalk for us,

526
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,780
to use your gift.

527
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:54,049
It's not a gift. It's a curse.

528
00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:56,118
When Derek walked, he was free.

529
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,554
He could go
see beautiful things,

530
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:00,122
to worlds that were paradises.

531
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:02,691
I wish it was like that for me,
but it's not.

532
00:28:02,693 --> 00:28:06,962
I only go to one place --
the Bad Place.

533
00:28:06,964 --> 00:28:08,831
It's just...

534
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,133
blood and death and monsters.

535
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:14,469
Well, it sounds like a lifetime
of bad dreams, but --

536
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:16,171
Bad dreams?

537
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:19,174
?

538
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:22,144
When I get hurt over there,
I don't wake up sweaty.

539
00:28:22,146 --> 00:28:24,179
I wake up bloody.

540
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:26,381
?

541
00:28:26,383 --> 00:28:29,918
This scar, it's not
the only one.

542
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,622
I'm sorry about your mom,
but I can't help you.

543
00:28:35,192 --> 00:28:38,660
All right, fine. Um...
we can find another way.

544
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:40,095
We, um...

545
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:43,365
Get in the car.
Dean.

546
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:47,436
Dean.

547
00:28:47,438 --> 00:28:49,504
Get in the car.

548
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:54,743
?

549
00:28:54,745 --> 00:28:56,912
Get in the damn car!

550
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:06,488
We're going to South Dakota.

551
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,993
?

552
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:23,271
?

553
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,943
So now what?

554
00:29:28,945 --> 00:29:30,879
We get Kaia to the Wind Caves,
and then what?

555
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:32,814
Force her to dreamwalk
at gunpoint?

556
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:36,317
We get Mom back,
no matter what.

557
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,953
Remember?

558
00:29:40,757 --> 00:29:49,197
?

559
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:52,901
I'm sorry...
about all of this.

560
00:29:52,903 --> 00:29:56,137
I was like you, Kaia,
afraid of my powers.

561
00:29:56,139 --> 00:30:00,241
But it doesn't have
to be like that.

562
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:03,545
You said that you wished that
things could've been different,

563
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:05,980
and that's why
you reached out to Derek.

564
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:09,217
Derek thought
that <i>you</i> could help <i>me,</i>

565
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:11,119
and <i>I</i> could help <i>you.</i>

566
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:14,122
Why do you keep
saying his name?

567
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:16,024
Derek's dead
because of you.

568
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:19,494
?

569
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:20,995
Five seconds.

570
00:30:20,997 --> 00:30:22,430
What?

571
00:30:22,432 --> 00:30:26,201
Give me five seconds
to show you what Derek saw,

572
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:27,902
what I saw with him.

573
00:30:27,904 --> 00:30:30,605
It wasn't
just the Bad Place.

574
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:32,774
It was...

575
00:30:32,776 --> 00:30:35,043
everything.

576
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:37,745
It's...amazing.

577
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:41,883
Five seconds.

578
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:45,954
?

579
00:30:51,061 --> 00:30:54,696
?

580
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:06,307
Our powers can be good.

581
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:09,110
We can do good in
this world.

582
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,400
?

583
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:34,168
Oh, crap.

584
00:31:36,806 --> 00:31:47,081
?

585
00:31:47,317 --> 00:31:52,620
?

586
00:31:52,622 --> 00:31:55,323
Okay, let's go.
Let's go!

587
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:58,993
Out, out, out, out.
Jack, come on.

588
00:31:58,995 --> 00:32:03,197
?

589
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:06,067
Hey! Get 'em in the boat.

590
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:07,568
Aah!

591
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,571
Come on! Go, go, go!
Come on! Go!

592
00:32:10,573 --> 00:32:20,848
?

593
00:32:21,084 --> 00:32:30,491
?

594
00:32:30,727 --> 00:32:37,699
?

595
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:39,934
Need that boy,
Dean Winchester.

596
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,670
Heaven's running out of angels.
Only he can save us.

597
00:32:42,672 --> 00:32:45,473
As far as I'm concerned,
you dicks can fry.

598
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:48,843
Yes, well, you first.

599
00:32:48,845 --> 00:32:58,920
?

600
00:33:00,924 --> 00:33:11,032
?

601
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:13,101
What's happening?

602
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:15,203
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

603
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:18,005
We're screwed.
There's too damn many of 'em!

604
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:19,907
We gotta go up. Let's go!

605
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:29,984
?

606
00:33:32,956 --> 00:33:38,393
?

607
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:41,262
- How long will this warding hold?
- I don't know.

608
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:51,539
?

609
00:33:51,775 --> 00:34:00,748
?

610
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:04,285
?

611
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:06,888
Hey, Dean,
maybe if we let 'em in

612
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,723
and then
we blast them all away.

613
00:34:08,725 --> 00:34:10,425
No, they get in here,
we're dead.

614
00:34:12,529 --> 00:34:14,529
Jack, can you do anything?
I can try,

615
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:16,431
but they'll hit me
with angel radio again.

616
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:23,938
Okay, all right, so then
we go out guns blazing.

617
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,973
We take out as many
as we can.

618
00:34:25,975 --> 00:34:29,510
Kid, sorry to drag you into
this. This was not your fight.

619
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:34,515
If they get up here,

620
00:34:34,517 --> 00:34:36,918
they'll kill you all
and take me.

621
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,753
No, they won't.

622
00:34:38,755 --> 00:34:40,188
You said I could help you
find the door

623
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,490
to another world, right?
Yes.

624
00:34:42,492 --> 00:34:45,827
Let's do it. Let's get out of here.

625
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:47,395
Hey, can you take us
to our mom?

626
00:34:48,932 --> 00:34:51,399
Can you do it?!
I don't know. I think so.

627
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:54,602
What if something goes wrong?

628
00:34:54,604 --> 00:34:57,672
Something already is
going wrong! Jack, do it.

629
00:34:57,674 --> 00:35:01,542
?

630
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:06,447
Are you ready?

631
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:09,484
No. Let's go.

632
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:31,506
?

633
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:38,346
Okay, I'm there.
I'm in the Bad Place.

634
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:43,985
?

635
00:35:49,158 --> 00:35:50,958
Let go.

636
00:35:53,096 --> 00:35:56,631
-I can't.
-Yes. You can.

637
00:35:58,935 --> 00:36:09,210
?

638
00:36:09,445 --> 00:36:12,547
?

639
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:13,948
There.

640
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:21,989
?

641
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:25,026
Dean, you gotta see this.

642
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:26,861
Come here!

643
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:30,665
Jack, now!

644
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:34,168
?

645
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:38,873
?

646
00:36:41,578 --> 00:36:44,211
I see her.

647
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:52,687
All right,
they're almost through.

648
00:36:52,689 --> 00:36:55,056
?

649
00:36:56,826 --> 00:36:58,926
No!

650
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:00,795
Focus.

651
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:03,264
?

652
00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:04,765
I'm losing it!

653
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:07,969
Almost. Almost!

654
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:15,943
?

655
00:37:47,143 --> 00:37:49,711
Hey! Sam, could you
call me back?

656
00:37:51,314 --> 00:37:53,681
I just need to know
you're okay.

657
00:37:57,787 --> 00:37:59,253
Patience?

658
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:03,224
Jody, I...I had a vision.

659
00:38:03,226 --> 00:38:05,226
Something bad's coming.

660
00:38:05,228 --> 00:38:10,665
?

661
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:23,878
?

662
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:33,955
?

663
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:44,065
?

664
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:54,142
?

665
00:38:54,377 --> 00:39:01,616
?

666
00:39:08,158 --> 00:39:18,065
?

667
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:23,905
?

668
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:40,254
?

669
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:51,165
Sam?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

670
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,067
Hey.
No, no, no, I'm good.

671
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:58,206
Ah!

672
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:06,681
?

673
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:08,382
Come on.

674
00:40:12,222 --> 00:40:22,230
?

675
00:40:22,232 --> 00:40:24,498
Where the hell are we?

676
00:40:26,836 --> 00:40:37,078
?

677
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:47,188
?

678
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:52,260
