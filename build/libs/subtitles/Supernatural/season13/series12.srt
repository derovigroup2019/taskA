1
00:00:01,394 --> 00:00:02,927
It's a powerful spellbook,

2
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:06,528
a tome of Druidic magic
called the Black Grimoire.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,996
A powerful spellbook
shows up,

4
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:09,531
and all of a sudden,
you're here to help?

5
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,066
Do you want to break the curse
on your brother?

6
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:12,968
We need to find that book.

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,470
<i>Abi!</i>

8
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:22,678
The book.
You're no fun.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,346
<i>Oh, if you're looking</i>
<i>for Rowena,</i>

10
00:00:24,348 --> 00:00:26,682
<i>she is presently indisposed,</i>

11
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,250
which is a delicate way
of saying

12
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:31,220
I stomped on her face
till the white meat showed

13
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:33,555
and then set her on fire
just in case.

14
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:34,990
I don't need to waste my grace,

15
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,458
and there's plenty
in the cupboard.

16
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,193
Oh, touch me and I'll --

17
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:40,295
Don't worry.
I won't take it all.

18
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:41,864
Save some for a rainy day.

19
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:44,533
You would seem to be
the weak link on this team.

20
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:48,670
Yes, my grace is a little bit
depleted, but give me time, man.

21
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:52,307
Now you know better than
to screw with me, Asmodeus.

22
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:56,111
Oh, I knew better than to screw
with the <i>old</i> you.

23
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:01,917
I'm a collector.
Lucifer could be useful.

24
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:05,954
Castiel is a card to play if
the Winchesters get out of line.

25
00:01:23,574 --> 00:01:25,641
Hey, Marty.
How's your night?

26
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:35,017
<i>?</i>

27
00:01:37,922 --> 00:01:47,496
<i>?</i>

28
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:50,899
<i>?</i>

29
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:52,301
Hi.

30
00:01:52,303 --> 00:01:53,902
Hey.

31
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:56,338
Excuse me.

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,173
<i>Aegrota amore.</i>

33
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:14,356
?

34
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:22,731
?

35
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,566
Oh, my God. Hi.

36
00:02:24,568 --> 00:02:26,935
I was totally hoping
we could talk.

37
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:28,370
You want to talk with me?

38
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:32,107
Mm-hmm.
I mean, you're <i>so</i> handsome.

39
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:34,042
Really?

40
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:36,678
What's your name?
Dale.

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,215
I'm Jamie, and that's
my sister Jennie.

42
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,554
Y'all from around here?

43
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:46,955
Nah, my sister and I
are on our way

44
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,624
to this little town
called Lebanon.

45
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,493
Heard of it?
I can't say that I have.

46
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,500
You are so beautiful.

47
00:02:58,502 --> 00:03:01,536
Oh. Thank you.

48
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:06,008
Anyway, we're out of gas
<i>and</i> we're out of money.

49
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,111
Tragic, right?

50
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:12,347
That is terrible.

51
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:14,316
Well, what can I do for ya?

52
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:16,652
I'll do anything.

53
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,388
I knew you were our hero.

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,889
The easiest thing

55
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:23,358
would be to take all the money
from the register,

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,129
grab a couple bottles
of good vodka,

57
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:29,131
and bring it outside.

58
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,600
What about Marty?

59
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,168
What about him?

60
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:42,778
?

61
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:52,821
?

62
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:54,823
Finally.

63
00:03:54,825 --> 00:04:00,095
?

64
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:02,197
Got it for you, baby.

65
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,632
What's with the hammer?

66
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:06,168
Oh, my God, sexy,
it's just for in case.

67
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,569
Like, for protection.

68
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:09,504
This is a dangerous place
at night.

69
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:12,674
I mean, that guy in there
totally just got killed.

70
00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:15,844
Oh, don't worry. I won't let
anything bad happen to you.

71
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:18,780
I love you.
Oh, I love you, too.

72
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:21,149
Uh, what was
your name again?

73
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:23,418
- Dale.
- Right. Yes.

74
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,520
But don't worry, Dale.

75
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:27,823
Our mom taught us
three really important steps

76
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,424
to looking out for ourselves.

77
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:32,294
Always look your best.
never get attached to a man.

78
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:35,063
And <i>always</i> make the death
look non-magical,

79
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:36,865
so you don't
attract Hunters.

80
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:38,233
The death?

81
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:43,271
Now be a good boy and hold
really still for me.

82
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,516
How'd we do?

83
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:56,985
So good.

84
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:05,058

00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,366
All right.

87
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:13,770
We've got
<i>“Principia Phantasmagoia”.</i>

88
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,138
We have...

89
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,441
“Archive of
the Unnatural Occurrences”.

90
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:20,344
[ Thud .
And we've got “Jower et Nuet”.

91
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,079
Kind of a weird name.

92
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,515
<i>“Jour et Nuit.”</i>
It's, uh, it's French.

93
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:28,085
It means
“The Book of Day and Night.”

94
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,419
Fancy.

95
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:31,888
So this is everything
that even mentions

96
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,323
some alternate realities.

97
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:34,858
So there's bound to be
something in here

98
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,693
that talks about
the Apocalypse World, right?

99
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:39,196
Yeah, maybe.
<i>Dude.</i>

100
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:40,797
I'm just saying, Dean,

101
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,900
Jack was our way over there,
obviously, so with him gone --

102
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:45,335
Okay, well,
Jack's been gone before.

103
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:46,870
We found him once.
We can find him again.

104
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:48,238
No, no, he didn't run away.

105
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,374
He is <i>literally</i> in
an alternate reality.

106
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,876
Okay, so we'll just come up
with a plan B, okay?

107
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:55,579
You said it yourself. We just keep
our heads down and we'll do the work.

108
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:56,880
<i>You</i> said that.

109
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:59,016
And I was right.

110
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:00,617
Yeah.

111
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:03,320
So you read, do your Sam thing.

112
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,988
I'm gonna go for a beer run.

113
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,423
Yeah.

114
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:08,158
We should probably
loop Cass in at some point.

115
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,395
We'll fill him in when he calls.
He checks in every day.

116
00:06:11,397 --> 00:06:13,897
Yeah, with a bunch
of questions and no leads.

117
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,733
I'm sure he is doing
the best he can.

118
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:19,169
Just go get beer or...

119
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:30,047
?

120
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:36,720
?

121
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:39,823
Huh. Always thought
you'd have a...

122
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:41,758
bigger stick.

123
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,362
What's your name again?

124
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,731
They call me Dipper.

125
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:50,300
And you let them.

126
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:52,703
Listen, Dipper,

127
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:55,172
it's not the size of the stick,

128
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:56,473
it's how you use it.

129
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:59,509
Funniest thing --
I'm always hearing that

130
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:02,913
from guys with...
little sticks.

131
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:11,254
Smooth.

132
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,890
We gave the warding
a little kick.

133
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,192
Just for you.

134
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:18,195
Thanks. <i>So</i> considerate.

135
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:19,663
Appreciate that a lot.

136
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:23,300
You're not nice,
and I don't like you.

137
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:24,835
You're treating me like
an every day angel!

138
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:26,303
And if I had
just a little more power,

139
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:27,838
I could tear
this place apart!

140
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,974
Just sayin'.

141
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:32,809
Ah!

142
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:39,349
You don't have that power,
and they know it.

143
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:41,651
Okay, well, if somebody
would be a pal

144
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:43,186
and let me eat
a little of his grace,

145
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:45,155
I would have enough strength
to get out of here

146
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:47,691
and butcher that
son of a bitch!

147
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:50,327
Well, that's a nice,
horrifying plan.

148
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:51,795
Little cannibalism.

149
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:54,965
Really? I seem to remember
a somebody

150
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:58,635
snacking on angel grace
once upon a time.

151
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,906
There is no “I” in “team”"
Castiel.

152
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:04,741
I want you to remember that.

153
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:09,446
Fine, whatever. I can wait.

154
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:13,483
Asmodeus was
my weakest creation.

155
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:15,452
Oh, he was, was he?

156
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,187
Doesn't seem that weak
to me.

157
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:19,389
Yeah, yeah, that -- that whole
shape-shifty thing he does?

158
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:20,891
I-I didn't give him that.

159
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:23,727
But so what? The old dog's
learned some new tricks.

160
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,631
Eventually, he's gonna mess up.
Then he's mine. Okay?

161
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,933
Excuses aside,

162
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:32,536
you're saying that
you're too weak

163
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:35,205
to overcome even
your weakest creation.

164
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,043
Shut up.

165
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,616
Somebody! Help!

166
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:49,019
Please, there's something
wrong with my sister!

167
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:51,319
Please, please. Please.

168
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:52,190
Okay. Watch out,
watch out, watch out.

169
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,024
- What happened?
- I don't know. Please.

170
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:55,492
She just --
she just collapsed.

171
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,627
I -- We were walking
and...

172
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:59,896
<i>Aegrota amore.</i>

173
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:07,904
Doesn't a kiss, like,

174
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:10,006
usually wake up
your true love?

175
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:20,250
?

176
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,552
?

177
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:28,658
Thank you.

178
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:33,163
You saved me.

179
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:35,298
Are you Dean Winchester?

180
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,900
I-I...

181
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:39,636
Yeah.

182
00:09:39,638 --> 00:09:42,906
How are you feeling?
How are <i>you</i> feeling?

183
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,443
Good.

184
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:47,844
Real good.

185
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:54,217
?

186
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,322
Hey, uh...

187
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:00,957
I think
you might be right.

188
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,425
I think maybe it's time
we go ahead and call Cass,

189
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,794
because, I mean, if -- if...

190
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:10,033
You all right?

191
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:12,936
Am I all right?

192
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:14,437
I'm in love.

193
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:17,040
You...Oh, <i>are</i> you?

194
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:19,809
I mean, I am, like,
full-on twitterpated here.

195
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:21,645
Seriously, I can't wait for you
to meet her, either.

196
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:23,046
She -- I mean, she's...

197
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:24,548
She's sweet
and she's beautiful

198
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,349
and she's just
kinda sorta perfect.

199
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:28,852
Anyway, I'm thinking of asking
her to move in with me here...

200
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:30,420
if that's cool,

201
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,722
'cause this is big-time.

202
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:34,791
Ahh.

203
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:40,497
Uh, Dean, w-what are you doing
with the Black Grimoire?

204
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,634
It's a gift. For Jamie.

205
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:47,804
For...Jamie?

206
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:50,440
My soul mate.

207
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:51,975
Sure. Right.

208
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:54,511
And she happen to ask
for that book by, uh, name?

209
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:57,380
Yeah! I mean, isn't that
kind of cosmic fate,

210
00:10:57,382 --> 00:10:59,516
- that we actually have it?
- Like...

211
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:01,651
“Cosmic fate.”
Right, yeah.

212
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:03,587
Okay, okay, okay.

213
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,355
I think I know
what's going on here.

214
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:07,557
Do you remember, uh,
uh, Becky in Vegas?

215
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,025
The love spell and...

216
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:10,660
No.
M--

217
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:13,263
Okay, I think Jamie must be
a-a witch or a demon --

218
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:14,864
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
<i>Whoa.</i>

219
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:17,901
- What?
- Be nice.

220
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:20,604
'Cause she's got a sister.

221
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:22,238
And if you play your cards
right, you know,

222
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,940
you guys might fall
for each other.

223
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,942
You know, the less attractive
siblings, they fall in love.

224
00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:27,978
That's kind of cute,
right? Huh?

225
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,946
Just hold on a second.
I can't wait

226
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:31,414
'cause she's waiting for me at
the market, so I'm just gonna...

227
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,453
Okay. All right.
That's fine.

228
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:38,088
You know why?

229
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,390
I'll walk 'cause it is...

230
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:42,292
? gorgeous outside ?
Wait a second.

231
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:43,827
Dean, listen, honestly --

232
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,862
Ooh.

233
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:47,330
<i>Right</i> on the button.

234
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,732
Listen, when I get back
from my date,

235
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:50,667
I'm gonna help you
ice that, okay?

236
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:55,171
All right, thanks.
Good talk, pal! Good talk!

237
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,940
You gonna make the call
after we get the book?

238
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:59,576
No. We're fully, like,
making an audible.

239
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:07,484
?

240
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:09,653
Where's the car?

241
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:11,655
I wanted the car.

242
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:14,357
There you go.

243
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,925
Good boys get a kiss.

244
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:17,994
Close your eyes.

245
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:20,263
?

246
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:31,474
Get away from him.

247
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:32,909
You heard me.

248
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:34,177
Don't point a gun at her!

249
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:35,812
- Hey!
- Uhh! No, Dean!

250
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:37,313
Don't you point a gun at her!
What are you doing?!

251
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:38,748
Where is it?

252
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,316
- You're jealous!
- There's gotta be a hex bag.

253
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:42,318
Where is it?
Please, just --

254
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,787
We should get out of here,

255
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:45,622
in case the one with the hair
actually wins.

256
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:47,090
- No, no, no, don't -- don't leave.
- Bye, boys.

257
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:49,626
Where is it? Huh?

258
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:54,998
?

259
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,833
Look, Dean!
Look, I got it!

260
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:58,902
Hex bag! Wait, Dean --

261
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,904
Aah! No!

262
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,673
I'm sorry, Sam. I just --
I love her so much.

263
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:19,255
Hello, boys.

264
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:23,346
Rise. Rise.

265
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:25,982
Rise. Rise.

266
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:28,885
Mm.

267
00:13:36,495 --> 00:13:38,929
Don't think we forgot
about you.

268
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:41,364
When the boss gets back,

269
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:44,568
<i>big</i> plans for you.

270
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:52,142
Oh, does he have big plans?

271
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:54,311
Hey, what's that gonna be worth
when Michael gets here

272
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:56,413
and, oh, yeah,
<i>murders us all?</i>

273
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:57,847
Right, <i>if</i> he gets here.

274
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:00,617
There's no “if” here
in this equation, okay?

275
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:02,852
Let me -- let me just --
let me just tell you something

276
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:04,554
about my dick brother --

277
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:08,091
about every version
of my dick brother, okay?

278
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:10,460
When he decides to do
something, he does it.

279
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:13,163
Doesn't matter what the cost
or who has to die.

280
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:17,000
It is gonna happen, 'cause
that's just the way he rolls.

281
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,804
If you're right, how much
time do we have?

282
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:23,573
How much time? Oh.

283
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:25,742
I guess that depends
on how much time he spends

284
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:28,178
torturing Mary Winchester.

285
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,513
He liked her, right?

286
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:32,249
Oh, Cass,
you should've seen it.

287
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:34,651
I mean,
the things he did to her.

288
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:36,086
In all my time in hell,

289
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:38,788
I have never seen anything
that <i>horrible.</i>

290
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,490
Just...Oh!

291
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:42,092
Stop. I don't wanna hear
any more of your lies.

292
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,893
Oh, this coming from the angel
who almost has me beat

293
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:46,963
in that department,
and that's saying a lot, pal.

294
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:48,565
Well, you always say a lot.

295
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,200
Okay, let's face it,
Cassandra,

296
00:14:50,202 --> 00:14:52,802
the truths I say hurt
'cause they're hard to swallow,

297
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:55,472
so people call 'em lies.

298
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:56,940
Go figure.

299
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:59,609
You want truth?

300
00:14:59,611 --> 00:15:03,413
How 'bout I tell you
a few truths about your son?

301
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:04,981
Did you just have
an angel stroke?

302
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:08,118
Did you know that
he loves movies?

303
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Fantasy movies,

304
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:12,856
movies with heroes

305
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:15,225
who crush villains.

306
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:18,395
Well, that's --
that's -- that's nurture.

307
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:19,863
That's not nature.

308
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:22,265
And he's thoughtful.

309
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:24,901
He's emotional.

310
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,369
Remarkably intuitive.

311
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:28,305
You -- you know, he, uh,

312
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:30,106
he resurrected me

313
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:32,275
just out of instinct.

314
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:34,344
Isn't that
a beautiful gesture?

315
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:36,179
?

316
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:39,115
Yeah, that's, uh,
that's beautiful.

317
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:44,287
Jack would rather kill you

318
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:46,256
than hug you.

319
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:48,491
Seems relevant.

320
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,126
Did you know he doesn't --

321
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:53,129
he doesn't even really
look like you.

322
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:57,000
And he reminds me so much
of his mother.

323
00:15:57,002 --> 00:15:58,868
?

324
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,404
Wow.

325
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:13,383
?

326
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:16,653
Ask me.

327
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:18,221
How are you alive?

328
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:20,023
Lucifer told us
he killed you

329
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:23,259
pretty, uh...
pretty graphically.

330
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:25,729
And he did.

331
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:28,465
But I take precautions to ensure
that if I die...

332
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,400
it is temporary.

333
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:31,901
You're talking about
a, uh, resurrection spell,

334
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:33,436
like last time?

335
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:35,071
Mm, mm.

336
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:36,606
That said,

337
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:38,441
it took a very long time
to heal.

338
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:42,212
And I'm not interested in it
ever happening again,

339
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:45,181
which is why I need
the Black Grimoire.

340
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:46,649
What a coincidence.

341
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:48,218
You happen to show up
right when it's stolen.

342
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,787
Oh, no coincidence.

343
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:53,189
I felt the book moving.

344
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:55,825
In a moment of weakness, I may
have put a tracking spell

345
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,961
on the Grimoire
behind your backs.

346
00:16:57,963 --> 00:17:00,530
Moment of weakness, huh?
Right.

347
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:02,465
Why do you want it so bad?
Why now?

348
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:05,835
Oh, years ago, the Grand Coven
cast a binding spell

349
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:10,507
limiting aspects of my magic.

350
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:14,444
There's a page in the Grimoire
that may help.

351
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:16,980
Help you become more powerful?
Yeah, that's what we want.

352
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:19,883
- Help me protect myself.
- Let me get this straight.

353
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:22,719
You, uh, felt the book moving
and you decided, what?

354
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:24,754
You'd -- you'd -- you'd
show up and just take it?

355
00:17:24,756 --> 00:17:28,057
Well, I thought about asking you
nicely for it, but...

356
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:30,059
Yeah, but you knew we'd
tell you to go to Hell.

357
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:31,661
Exactly.

358
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:34,697
Now I'm -- I'm worried the girls
will damage the book,

359
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:36,733
and you're worried about
the awful things

360
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:39,335
they'll do with it, so...

361
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:42,472
Let's...help each other,
shall we?

362
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:44,507
We don't need your help.
We've handled witches before.

363
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:46,042
You're familiar with
our work, right?

364
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:49,846
Ah. Oh, you Winchesters.

365
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:52,749
I've changed.

366
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:57,187
Honestly.

367
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:59,422
Having your skull crushed
and being burned alive

368
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:02,292
can do that to a girl.

369
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:04,060
And it's my tracking spell,

370
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:07,797
so if you want to find
those girls...

371
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,233
Well, lover?

372
00:18:10,235 --> 00:18:11,868
Okay.

373
00:18:12,938 --> 00:18:15,305
You'll need me.

374
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:17,373
<i>Sl?inte.</i>

375
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,010
Oh.

376
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:23,813
One more thing.

377
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:26,216
Where's my son?

378
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:34,290
There are
whole parts of this

379
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,925
I can't really read.

380
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:37,427
Because it's
too complicated?

381
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:40,563
No. Because it's ultra...
old.

382
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:42,065
I mean, some
of these symbols

383
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,434
are things
Mom never even mentioned.

384
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:46,102
Um, so we wing it.

385
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:47,570
We're really good
at improvising.

386
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:49,572
And you've totally got
the skills.

387
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:51,574
Aw. Thanks.

388
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:55,078
Now you girls <i>are</i> gonna
pay for that stuff, right?

389
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,947
Wow. Thanks for the reminder
of how shopping works.

390
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,983
- Well, because last time you just --
- Oh, my God!

391
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:03,620
Shut up, Brenda.
Like, please, shut up.

392
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,722
She's <i>so</i> rude.

393
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:08,424
Huh.
What?

394
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:14,063
I-I'm pretty sure this says
we need a soul to sacrifice.

395
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:16,366
Okay.

396
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:22,839
?

397
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:25,909
Fergus is dead?

398
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,677
Yep.

399
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,246
Killed himself for us.

400
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:32,081
That doesn't sound like him.

401
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,850
Right, well,
Fergus, uh, uh...

402
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:37,420
Crowley, um,
he had changed a lot.

403
00:19:37,422 --> 00:19:39,856
You'd have
been proud of him.

404
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,724
Is that so?

405
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,831
Fergus was my only child.

406
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,902
And I promise you, I'd much
rather have a living son,

407
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:56,706
even one that hated me,
than a dead hero.

408
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,274
Because of him...

409
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:01,911
Lucifer is trapped
in another reality. So...

410
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:03,546
Yeah, the Devil's gone.

411
00:20:03,548 --> 00:20:06,215
Oh, don't be stupid.
He's never gone!

412
00:20:06,217 --> 00:20:08,751
Okay, listen, I know what
Lucifer's cap--

413
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:10,219
Oh, c-can we not?

414
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:12,288
It's like reminiscing about
an abusive relationship.

415
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,457
Why do that?
Let's get back to the book.

416
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:16,926
What kind of hurt can -
these chicks do with it?

417
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:20,863
Oh, I'm sure they have
big plans.

418
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:23,399
Sounds like you know 'em.
Just remember being

419
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:27,337
a young, overly ambitious,
wee witch.

420
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:30,406
And I have to give them
some credit.

421
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:33,076
Outfoxed you, didn't they?

422
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:35,745
Tell me...

423
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:41,417
did they get to fifth base?

424
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:45,488
There's no such thing
as fifth base.

425
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,193
Oh, you poor, sheltered boy.

426
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:52,962
Anyway...

427
00:20:52,964 --> 00:20:56,599
What's by is by. And who knows?

428
00:20:56,601 --> 00:21:00,303
If I help you,
maybe you'll change your minds

429
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:04,374
about helping me.

430
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:09,345
- No.
- Not happening.

431
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:15,752
So we were maybe
too optimistic.

432
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:18,521
Don't bail out now, Jennie.
I'm not.

433
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:20,790
But if this goes wrong,

434
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,692
who knows what could happen?

435
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:25,795
Ugh. If you, like, really don't
think we can do this,

436
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:27,630
then it's time to make
a phone call.

437
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:29,732
No.

438
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:31,634
I'm not asking for help.

439
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:43,546
We're doing this for Mom.

440
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:45,481
She taught us everything,

441
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:47,550
sacrificed so much for us.

442
00:21:47,552 --> 00:21:50,520
She sacrifice
so many <i>people</i> for us.

443
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:52,655
She was an amazing witch,

444
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:56,492
and she deserves to be alive
and gorgeous and with us.

445
00:21:56,494 --> 00:21:59,362
And with this book, we can
absolutely bring her back.

446
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:01,798
I know. Just...

447
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,933
just don't yell at me.

448
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:07,236
?

449
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:09,672
Listen.

450
00:22:09,674 --> 00:22:11,507
I'm sorry.

451
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:14,143
I know I'm the big sister
and I'm supposed

452
00:22:14,145 --> 00:22:17,647
to be the strong one
or whatever, but...

453
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:19,716
?

454
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:21,050
Yeah?

455
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:24,253
I just...really miss her.

456
00:22:26,658 --> 00:22:28,725
I do, too.

457
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:30,626
I know.

458
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:32,361
And...

459
00:22:32,363 --> 00:22:34,630
I, like,
really believe in us.

460
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,668
Jamie, I...

461
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,571
I just want her back so bad.

462
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:43,539
And we're <i>going</i> to
get her back,

463
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,375
even if we have to cast
every spell in this book

464
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:48,544
and crush the skulls
of, like, a million people

465
00:22:48,546 --> 00:22:51,380
to make it happen.
Okay.

466
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:53,049
- Yes?
- Yeah.

467
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:56,619
I believe in you, too, Jennie,

468
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:59,689
because I love you.

469
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:01,924
Aw.

470
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:03,659
That's so great.

471
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:09,198
?

472
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,134
Still need that soul, right?

473
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:12,535
For sure.

474
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:14,270
Cool.

475
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:18,775
?

476
00:23:24,716 --> 00:23:33,489
?

477
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,227
Welcome to
Stillwater, Oklahoma.

478
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:44,697
How depressingly Midwestern.

479
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:46,098
All right, Red. Where to?

480
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,668
The tracking spell
isn't like GPS.

481
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,706
The book's not moving
and it's in this general area.

482
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:56,208
We'll need to speak
to the yokels.

483
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,610
Okay, well, small-town folks

484
00:23:57,612 --> 00:23:59,345
usually like to look out
for themselves.

485
00:23:59,347 --> 00:24:00,746
I can make them talk.

486
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:02,882
Uh, your spells tend
to boil people's brains,

487
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:04,583
So maybe let us handle it.

488
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:06,118
Fine, fine, we can do

489
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,053
your very time-consuming
investi...

490
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:13,526
Okay, see, “we” aren't
doing anything.

491
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:15,327
I'll keep an eye on her.
Great.

492
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,229
Leave me with the babysitter
if you must,

493
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:19,565
but do start with the women.

494
00:24:22,303 --> 00:24:23,836
Something tells me
those girls

495
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:26,739
aren't popular
with other ladies.

496
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:33,646
Face it.

497
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:37,917
You are useless and impotent
and unnecessary,

498
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,519
and you will die alone,

499
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,721
unmourned.

500
00:24:42,723 --> 00:24:44,323
You talking to me,
pretty boy?

501
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:46,759
No, he's talking to me.

502
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:50,829
Yeah.

503
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:54,500
Yeah. Well,
he does have a point.

504
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:58,470
Aw, did you lose
your little stick?

505
00:24:58,472 --> 00:24:59,905
I did.

506
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:06,378
How did you...

507
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,280
- Turns out rage is a good motivator.
-Ah!

508
00:25:08,282 --> 00:25:10,416
And I think you forgot something.

509
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:12,217
I'm Lucifer.

510
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:16,388
Told you size didn't matter.

511
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,756
You...

512
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:20,192
Whoops.

513
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:23,963
Someone got mad
and broke his warding.

514
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:37,343
?

515
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:39,845
Good times.

516
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:44,383
Well, this is boring.

517
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:47,186
Is there...
I don't know, music?

518
00:25:48,456 --> 00:25:50,155
Yeah, yeah, uh, you know,

519
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:52,191
Dean has a tape of
Led Zeppelin's “Moby Dick”

520
00:25:52,193 --> 00:25:54,326
with an 8-minute drum solo.

521
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:56,662
Let me see.
It's around here somewhere.

522
00:25:56,664 --> 00:25:58,330
Are you very sure

523
00:25:58,332 --> 00:25:59,999
I can't just enslave
some townsfolk

524
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:02,134
and make them take us
to the girls?

525
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:03,535
I'm very sure you can,

526
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:06,305
but I'm also very sure
you shouldn't.

527
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:08,707
Bless your precious heart,

528
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:11,810
you just described
my entire life.

529
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,718
Rowena...

530
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,821
even if you pull off whatever
plan you're trying to pull off,

531
00:26:22,823 --> 00:26:24,323
and even if you manage
to get the book back --

532
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:29,161
I've been on
my best behavior.

533
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:31,096
Okay, sure.

534
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:34,266
Let's say
you get the book.

535
00:26:34,268 --> 00:26:37,970
It's not gonna change
anything.

536
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:42,675
You're still gonna feel
helpless.

537
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:45,844
What Lucifer did to you --

538
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:48,280
Told you, I don't...

539
00:26:52,353 --> 00:26:55,087
?

540
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:59,725
Before he crushed my skull,

541
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:03,562
Lucifer showed me his face.

542
00:27:03,564 --> 00:27:05,597
His <i>true</i> face.

543
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:10,569
I'm scared, Sam.

544
00:27:10,571 --> 00:27:13,906
All the time.

545
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:17,743
I've seen it, too,

546
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:20,446
what he really
looks like behind --

547
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,915
behind whatever vessel.
It...

548
00:27:26,387 --> 00:27:28,420
Yeah, still keeps me up
at night.

549
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:33,759
How do you deal with it?

550
00:27:37,631 --> 00:27:41,633
I guess I don't deal with it.
Not really. I mean, I...

551
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:44,570
I pushed it down and, um...

552
00:27:44,572 --> 00:27:46,839
the -- the world kept
almost ending,

553
00:27:46,841 --> 00:27:51,009
so I-I keep
pushing it down, and...

554
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:54,379
I don't know. I...

555
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,282
I don't really talk about it,
not even with Dean.

556
00:27:57,284 --> 00:28:00,052
I mean, I-I-I could. You know,
he'd -- he'd listen, but...

557
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:02,788
?

558
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,493
That's not something
I really know how to share.

559
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:20,439
<i>?</i>

560
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:22,074
Hi there.

561
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,842
Been to a few other places,
haven't had much luck.

562
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:25,410
Was hoping you could
help me out.

563
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,679
Oh, happy to try.
What do you need?

564
00:28:27,681 --> 00:28:30,149
I'm looking for these
two girls, uh, in town --

565
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:31,583
Jennie and Jamie.

566
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,219
Oh. The Plum sisters.

567
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:37,456
Right. Yeah, I'm looking
to track them down.

568
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,459
Hmm. You and every other man
west of the Ozarks.

569
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:43,462
Popular, huh?
That's one word for it.

570
00:28:43,464 --> 00:28:45,531
And a whole mess of trouble.

571
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,466
Well, they took something,
and I need to get it back.

572
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:48,967
Heard it before --

573
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:51,370
they stole your heart,
you can't live without them.

574
00:28:51,372 --> 00:28:52,805
They stole a book.

575
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:54,273
A book?
Mm.

576
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,775
Honey,
now I know you're lying.

577
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,911
I doubt they can even read.

578
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:01,246
Well, that has been
up for debate.

579
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:02,948
If it helps, I don't plan on
being nice about it

580
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,184
when I do find them.

581
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:07,352
Mm.

582
00:29:09,657 --> 00:29:14,159
<i>?</i>

583
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:16,061
You gonna be <i>really</i> mean?

584
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:17,629
Yeah.

585
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,399
'Cause it's about damn time
someone was.

586
00:29:21,702 --> 00:29:23,569
Thank you.

587
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:25,571
You're welcome.

588
00:29:29,076 --> 00:29:31,910
Mmm.

589
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:33,979
Even if you do get
the book,

590
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:37,616
and even if you
get your power back,

591
00:29:37,618 --> 00:29:39,084
it won't matter.

592
00:29:39,086 --> 00:29:43,488
You won't ever be able
to change what happened.

593
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,425
You won't be able to change
how helpless you felt,

594
00:29:46,427 --> 00:29:49,595
or how helpless you feel.

595
00:29:49,597 --> 00:29:52,097
You're still gonna
get scared.

596
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:55,667
And that feeling...

597
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,670
that feeling never
goes away.

598
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,572
Never?

599
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:01,974
Never.

600
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:07,746
?

601
00:30:07,748 --> 00:30:09,781
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

602
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:11,283
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

603
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:12,718
I just need a minute.

604
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,520
I'm not fleeing.
Don't release the hounds.

605
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,189
- Hey.
- Hey.

606
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,757
What's going on?

607
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:21,693
Uh, she, uh, she's just needs
a minute. She's all right.

608
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,396
All right, well, I got
the address. Rowena was right.

609
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,432
These girls are not
fan favorites.

610
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,835
Right.
Time to get that book.

611
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:32,137
Oh, no, no.
You've done yo bit, okay?

612
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:33,672
We'll take it from here.

613
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:36,608
I was afraid
you might say that.

614
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,078
<i>Manete!</i>

615
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,513
Rowena!

616
00:30:41,515 --> 00:30:43,649
Rowena, stop!

617
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:45,517
Rowena, damn it!

618
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,020
Oh, come on.

619
00:30:48,022 --> 00:30:49,821
All right.

620
00:30:49,823 --> 00:30:52,057
I don't think it said
anything about tin foil.

621
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,393
Okay, so you don't
<i>think</i> it said anything?

622
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,495
I told you, there's all kinds
of weird writing.

623
00:30:56,497 --> 00:30:58,063
I was totally honest
about that.

624
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,265
Maybe there was something
wrong with his soul.

625
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:02,634
Maybe he was, like, a really
bad guy or something.

626
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:04,736
Come on. He as obviously
a total Boy Scout.

627
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,305
I don't think
that even matters.

628
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:09,207
We need to do something.
I'm looking!

629
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:10,776
I'm looking.

630
00:31:10,778 --> 00:31:14,346
You were supposed to get
the book and wait for <i>me.</i>

631
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:15,948
I...Uh...

632
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,850
Okay, like, the Winchesters
were all over us and --

633
00:31:18,852 --> 00:31:21,086
And we didn't wanna
call you.

634
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,323
Because we can
take care of ourselves.

635
00:31:24,325 --> 00:31:28,360
I told you about the book,
where to look for the boys.

636
00:31:28,362 --> 00:31:30,162
We had a deal.

637
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:33,031
Now I've had to use them
to find you.

638
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:34,533
You brought them here?

639
00:31:34,535 --> 00:31:37,836
When you nincompoops ran,
I did what I had to do.

640
00:31:37,838 --> 00:31:42,140
But I can still cast the spell.
We can still complete our deal.

641
00:31:42,142 --> 00:31:44,409
You'd still help us?

642
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:47,479
As long as you give me the book
when we're done.

643
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:49,147
You don't need it anyway.

644
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:50,949
Witches of your level
would --

645
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:54,753
- “Witches of our level”?
- Yes.

646
00:31:54,755 --> 00:31:57,389
Are you saying what our Mom
taught us wasn't good enough?

647
00:31:57,391 --> 00:32:00,659
Jennie, I think she's saying
we're not good enough.

648
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:03,362
You think
you're so smart, huh?

649
00:32:03,364 --> 00:32:06,064
Well, we already did
the spell.

650
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:07,532
Mostly.

651
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,001
Mostly?

652
00:32:12,406 --> 00:32:15,307
What have you done?

653
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:19,711
It's, like, step one of
bringing her back.

654
00:32:19,713 --> 00:32:22,514
We'll figure out the rest
after she kills you.

655
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:26,218
Unfortunate, but not
my first zombie, luv.

656
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,786
<i>Abi!</i>

657
00:32:27,788 --> 00:32:30,989
Oh, side effect of
the spell --

658
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,991
she's, like, magic-proof.

659
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,693
Ooh!

660
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:37,062
And she's totally gonna
eat your brain.

661
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,735
Needed a minute, huh?

662
00:32:43,737 --> 00:32:46,104
You don't have to say it, Dean.

663
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:47,539
Oh, I'm gonna say it.

664
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:49,007
She played you.

665
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,542
She played <i>us.</i>

666
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:51,777
And she's scared.

667
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,179
Yeah, well, she better be.
Come on.

668
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,747
You're, like, 8 feet tall.
You can't reach that?

669
00:32:55,749 --> 00:32:58,417
I almost got it.

670
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:00,585
Okay, got it, got it.

671
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:01,987
Ahh.

672
00:33:01,989 --> 00:33:04,823
All right.

673
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:13,598
All right, let's go kill
some witches. You want that?

674
00:33:21,842 --> 00:33:23,341
They'll be
more of them coming.

675
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:25,310
You know...

676
00:33:25,312 --> 00:33:29,081
this would be <i>so</i> much easier

677
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,615
if I was stronger.

678
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:33,085
Hint, hint, hint.

679
00:33:35,155 --> 00:33:36,688
Oh, come on, Castiel.

680
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,423
We just fought side by side,
mano e mano.

681
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:40,859
You gotta trust me now, man.
Come on.

682
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:42,461
Oh, I trusted you,

683
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:45,564
when we fought the Darkness,
and then you betrayed us.

684
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:47,065
And I trusted you --
Ah!

685
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:50,335
?

686
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:52,003
Fool me once...

687
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:55,941
I promise to leave you
a little. Come on.

688
00:33:57,377 --> 00:33:59,578
?

689
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,114
Uhh!

690
00:34:02,116 --> 00:34:04,349
This is me,

691
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:07,319
learning from my mistakes.

692
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,424
It's just a magical zombie.

693
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,960
You've deal with worse than
magical zombies before, Rowena.

694
00:34:14,962 --> 00:34:17,228
Oh!

695
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,365
Clearly you wanted your mom back
in better shape!

696
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:21,933
I can still do that.

697
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,102
Nah, you missed
your chance to play nice.

698
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,404
And you're kind of
all bark, no bite,

699
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:27,872
so she's gonna bite you.

700
00:34:27,874 --> 00:34:30,475
You're terrible.

701
00:34:30,477 --> 00:34:32,944
- Rowena!
- Boys! Wonderful!

702
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,547
I've been stalling them
until you arrived.

703
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:38,149
Hey, lovebug. Can't introduce
you to Mom right now.

704
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,852
She's busy. How 'bout
that kiss I owe you?

705
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:42,287
Sure.

706
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:45,457
Guns. Okay, <i>super</i> scary.

707
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:47,492
Witch-killing bullets.

708
00:34:47,494 --> 00:34:49,327
<i>Moveantur!</i>

709
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:50,862
Aah!

710
00:34:52,432 --> 00:34:55,333
?

711
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:02,340
?

712
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,443
?

713
00:35:05,445 --> 00:35:08,747
Sammy!
They're really weirdly strong.

714
00:35:08,749 --> 00:35:10,241
I think
it's probably a spell.

715
00:35:10,265 --> 00:35:11,384
You think?

716
00:35:11,385 --> 00:35:13,284
Aah! Uhh!

717
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:18,490
?

718
00:35:21,461 --> 00:35:23,695
Jennie!

719
00:35:23,697 --> 00:35:25,864
?

720
00:35:25,866 --> 00:35:27,332
Uhh!
Aah! Son of a...

721
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,003
?

722
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,439
Magic won't work on
this abomination!

723
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:36,841
Got any suggestions?!

724
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,576
Quickly!

725
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:41,012
Try shooting her in the head!
No!

726
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:51,122
?

727
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:58,630
?

728
00:35:58,632 --> 00:36:01,399
Mom!

729
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:06,838
?

730
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,474
<i>Impetus Bestiarum!</i>

731
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,148
Rowena.

732
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,453
End it.

733
00:36:21,455 --> 00:36:30,228
?

734
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:46,177
?

735
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:50,448
You really thought
afterall that,

736
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,984
I was going to try
to kill you?

737
00:36:52,986 --> 00:36:55,586
Yeah, you double-crossed us.

738
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,722
Triple-cross, actually.

739
00:36:57,724 --> 00:36:59,257
So I ended up on your side,

740
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,392
and we defeated the villains,
just as I planned.

741
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:03,928
Yeah, not buying that.

742
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,631
And that book?

743
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:08,032
You're gonna either
give it to us

744
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:09,867
or we can take it,
either way.

745
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:15,139
You know what
I've seen, what it's like.

746
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:18,543
Lucifer may be locked away,
but he'll be back.

747
00:37:18,545 --> 00:37:19,944
He always comes back.

748
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,846
And when he does...

749
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:24,015
I can't be helpless again.

750
00:37:24,017 --> 00:37:25,883
I need the spell.

751
00:37:25,885 --> 00:37:29,988
?

752
00:37:31,491 --> 00:37:38,730
?

753
00:37:42,702 --> 00:37:45,603
Can't believe I fell
for a love spell.

754
00:37:45,605 --> 00:37:47,705
And got clocked by
a witch with a hammer.

755
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:50,375
<i>And</i> zombie mom.

756
00:37:50,377 --> 00:37:53,177
Those are the details
that sell the story.

757
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:54,846
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Getting beat up by a girl --

758
00:37:54,848 --> 00:37:56,681
that's a story
I wanna tell someone.

759
00:37:56,683 --> 00:37:58,883
Girls beat us up
all the time.

760
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:01,252
Mm. True.

761
00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:05,990
Hey, you know that Rowena
is not our friend, right?

762
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,526
Yeah, I know that.

763
00:38:08,528 --> 00:38:10,161
Hmm.

764
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:16,334
Then what's that?

765
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:22,073
You gave her the page.

766
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:24,876
She got in your head, man.
She didn't get in my head.

767
00:38:24,878 --> 00:38:26,511
Look, what happened to Rowena
was messed up, okay?

768
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,179
But you just let the deadliest witch
in the world

769
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,448
walk away with a page
from this book.

770
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,984
Yeah, and if Rowena
breaks bad,

771
00:38:32,986 --> 00:38:36,954
I will hunt her down myself
and put a bullet in her.

772
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:40,625
I will, Dean.

773
00:38:40,627 --> 00:38:44,729
But if she's right, and if
she does see Lucifer again,

774
00:38:44,731 --> 00:38:47,398
then...

775
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,734
I hope she makes him suffer.

776
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:54,639
You gotta get out of
this dark place.

777
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:56,507
You know, whatever's
going on in your head...

778
00:38:56,509 --> 00:38:59,110
Dean.
What?

779
00:39:02,982 --> 00:39:04,482
You know what? Honestly?

780
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:06,751
Yeah, how 'bout honestly.

781
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:11,589
I know what Rowena is
dealing with.

782
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:13,758
And she's not
the only one who...

783
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,929
feels helpless.

784
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:23,034
What do you mean?

785
00:39:23,036 --> 00:39:25,136
?

786
00:39:25,138 --> 00:39:28,773
I mean, I had a plan,
you know. I, uh...

787
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:31,109
Help Jack, um,
bring Mom back.

788
00:39:31,111 --> 00:39:34,345
It wasn't much,
but it was something.

789
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:37,348
It -- it kept me from
spinning off the rails.

790
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:40,451
A-and now...Jack is gone,

791
00:39:40,453 --> 00:39:42,753
Mom is still in hell,
basically,

792
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,923
a-and I-I-I just...

793
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,694
We'll figure it out.

794
00:39:49,696 --> 00:39:52,463
Dean, we don't have a plan.

795
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:57,235
We don't know what to do.
So -- so...how?

796
00:39:58,404 --> 00:40:00,505
I don't know.

797
00:40:00,507 --> 00:40:03,441
?

798
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,744
But we will, you and me.

799
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:12,483
?

800
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:14,118
Yeah.

801
00:40:15,755 --> 00:40:17,555
Night.

802
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:27,565
?

803
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:30,401
