1
00:00:00,744 --> 00:00:02,377
Focus.

2
00:00:02,981 --> 00:00:05,281
All that matters is getting
Jack and your mother

3
00:00:05,283 --> 00:00:06,549
out of that place.

4
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:08,251
So here's the plan --

5
00:00:08,253 --> 00:00:10,053
- We grab Satan...
- Gents.

6
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:13,089
...and we use his grace to open
up a door between two universes.

7
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:15,525
Right.

8
00:00:15,527 --> 00:00:17,593
Then we get mom,
we get Jack, and we get out.

9
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:19,495
Slam the door before
Michael follows us

10
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:20,863
and destroys our universe.

11
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:23,333
Now it's...gonna be
harder than it sounds.

12
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:25,501
So the spell
to open this rift is in the...

13
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:26,903
The demon tablet.

14
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:28,271
And since you speak God,

15
00:00:28,273 --> 00:00:30,106
we figured it was
right up your alley.

16
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:33,676
Whatever you find
on that tablet,

17
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:35,278
you <i>will</i> report to me.

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,014
It's like pulling
freaking teeth!

19
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:39,582
Donatello, you okay?

20
00:00:39,584 --> 00:00:42,018
No soul, of course,
thanks to Amara.

21
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,054
Okay, but at least we know
the spell we need is in there.

22
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,756
And we have a plan.

23
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,833
Yeah, I really thought that was it for us.

24
00:00:56,835 --> 00:01:00,870
Yeah. Well, killin' vamps
makes me hungry.

25
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:03,139
Ahh, home, sweet home.

26
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:04,607
Feels good to be back.

27
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:05,975
Yeah, you're tellin' me.

28
00:01:05,977 --> 00:01:07,477
The last few weeks have
been a nightmare.

29
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,011
You know what?
We made it, though.

30
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:11,881
You, me, and the kid,
finally under one roof.

31
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:15,118
And, you know, honestly, it
doesn't matter where he's been.

32
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,486
I'm just glad Jack's back.

33
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:19,622
Right, home safe,
where he belongs.

34
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:32,502
Jack!

35
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:33,936
- Sam? Dean?
- Hurry!

36
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:35,505
Hold on!
Jack! Help!

37
00:01:35,507 --> 00:01:37,073
In here! Help!

38
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:37,794
I...

39
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:39,517
The door, man!
You gotta open the door!

40
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:40,743
- It's locked!
It -- it's a fire! We're trapped.

41
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:42,812
Come on!
What's happening?!

42
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:44,714
I can't...

43
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:47,550
That's it! That's it! You're doing it!

44
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:50,286
- Jack. Jack!
- Jack!

45
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,191
Jack. Jack?

46
00:01:55,193 --> 00:01:57,393
Jack!
Jack, please. Please open the door.

47
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:59,061
- Jack, open the door!
- Open the door!

48
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:00,530
- I can't!
- Help!

49
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:02,165
Jack, you gotta help us.

50
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:04,867
- Jack, please help.
- Jack!

51
00:02:10,642 --> 00:02:15,578
Zachariah, these mind games
of yours aren't working.

52
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,546
We're close.

53
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:19,715
Okay, I'll...

54
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:21,150
I'll keep trying.

55
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:24,086
And you're sure this...
half-breed

56
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:26,856
is our ticket
to the other side?

57
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:28,424
Yes.

58
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:30,593
And not just a single
one-way ticket

59
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:32,728
like the prophet's spell.

60
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,032
This boy, he can
open a rift big enough

61
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:38,501
to march an army through.

62
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,936
He has so much power.
We just...

63
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:43,873
have to make him use it.

64
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,675
Then make him.

65
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:49,612
Yes, Commander.

66
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:58,387
If fear won't break him,

67
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:00,723
I think I know something
that will.

Donatello?

72
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:47,403
Donatello?

73
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:52,475
- I... Uh...
- Come in.

74
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:56,912
Um...

75
00:03:56,914 --> 00:04:00,349
Sam and Dean thought
you might want some breakfast.

76
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:02,618
Oh. Um...Yeah.

77
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,253
Thank you.

78
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:08,524
Are you okay?

79
00:04:08,526 --> 00:04:12,394
- Fine, fine. Uh...
- just...

80
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:14,497
The tablet, it...

81
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,032
it has a raw energy.

82
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:20,469
There's a power here
I've never seen.

83
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:27,309
Tell the boys thank you
for me,

84
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:30,546
and, uh, I'm making progress.

85
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:48,364
Don't you think
you should, uh,

86
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,800
take it a little easy
on the nitrates?

87
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:53,536
Dude, if bacon's what
kills me, then I win.

88
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:55,070
Eh...

89
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:57,540
Cass, hey.

90
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:58,841
How's Donatello?

91
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:01,577
Well, he says
he's making progress,

92
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:02,945
but we still need
archangel grace.

93
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:04,613
We should be out
looking for Lucifer.

94
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:06,782
We are.

95
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:08,417
Look, we got word out to
every Hunter we know, okay?

96
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:10,152
If they see somethin'
Satan-y,

97
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:12,154
they'll drop a dime.

98
00:05:12,156 --> 00:05:13,622
And Michael?

99
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:15,991
If he succeeds in getting
to our world first?

100
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:17,426
Cass, look, right now,

101
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:19,829
our -- our best defense
is a good offense.

102
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,697
We give Donatello everything
he needs to open that gate.

103
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,532
Then we stealth in,

104
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:25,267
we get Mom, we get Jack.

105
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:27,403
Boom, family reunion.

106
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:29,605
It's just gonna
take some time.

107
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:41,250
Beautiful, isn't it?

108
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:42,718
Castiel.

109
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:47,556
Wanted you to see
the natural world before...

110
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:49,458
before it was spoiled.

111
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,060
Humans have good intentions,

112
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:55,364
but they never truly appreciated
the gift they were given.

113
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:57,132
Left to their own devices,

114
00:05:57,134 --> 00:06:00,569
humans...they would
destroy everything.

115
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:02,238
Why?

116
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:06,609
You've been so sheltered.

117
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:08,711
Let me show you.

118
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:15,651
<i>Humans...</i>

119
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:17,386
<i>they take and they take</i>

120
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:19,622
<i>and they just can't</i>
<i>help themselves.</i>

121
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:21,624
So <i>you...</i>

122
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:23,592
you have to help them.

123
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:28,397
Jack, you have the power
to save us all.

124
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,867
And I can guide you.

125
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:35,137
I can teach you some
miraculous things.

126
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,706
What about Sam and Dean?

127
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,743
Well, if only
they'd accepted you

128
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:44,313
instead of teaching you
to fear your powers.

129
00:06:46,684 --> 00:06:48,250
My powers...

130
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:50,786
Because they feared them.

131
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:53,689
Now if you'll just
do as I say...

132
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:57,993
No, that's not true.

133
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:00,829
I remember.

134
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:04,366
I was with Sam and Dean
the last time I used my powers.

135
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:08,070
We got separated, and...

136
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:11,040
I was in the other world.

137
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:17,046
You're not Castiel.

138
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:19,949
None of this is real.

139
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:30,726
Well, so much for
killing him with kindness.

140
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,297
You. Michael?

141
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:40,369
My lord.

142
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,870
Uhh!

143
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:44,406
We tried it your way.

144
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:51,580
Now...we do it mine.

145
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:17,973
Eureka!

146
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:20,576
Eureka, eureka,
eureka, eureka, eureka!

147
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:23,245
- Are you stroking out?
- No, I-I-I-I cracked it.

148
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:25,314
What?
The -- the spell.

149
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:27,116
I-I finished the translation.

150
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:30,085
What? No way.
Here are the ingredients.

151
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:32,254
Whew! Running is hard.

152
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:33,822
All right, what are we lookin' at?

153
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:35,824
Besides archangel grace.

154
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:37,526
Actually,
that's not even in here.

155
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:39,128
Uh, maybe the -- the spell in
the angel tablet's different

156
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,929
because this
oil of Abramelin,

157
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:42,498
angelica root, we...

158
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,266
We have
most of this stuff.

159
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:46,201
Oh.

160
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:49,071
Other than the --
the hearts of Gog and Magog?

161
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:50,606
Sorry. What?

162
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,841
Um, they're -- they're people.
Kind of.

163
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:56,412
Uh, sometimes referred to
as brothers, other times lands.

164
00:08:56,414 --> 00:08:59,048
Uh...
You know how Bibles are.

165
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,682
Too damn many translations.

166
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:02,684
Wait, Gog and -- and Magog...
I'd -- I'd heard rumors,

167
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:05,954
but I didn't think
they were human.

168
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:08,991
Oh, yes.

169
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:12,261
According to the tablet,
they were ancient warriors

170
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:14,897
who enslaved
half the Fertile Crescent,

171
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:17,566
until some priests cast
a spell to bind them away

172
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:21,336
in “a place without a place

173
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:23,939
and a time without a time.”

174
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,541
Okay, so we're supposed
to find these guys

175
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:27,609
and cut out their hearts?
How?

176
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:30,579
The -- the demon tablet has
very specific instructions

177
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:32,314
on how to free them.

178
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:35,050
These men are very dangerous.

179
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,785
Then I'll do it.

180
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:38,554
I'll go with you.

181
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:41,190
Excellent!
And Sam and I will stay behind

182
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:44,460
to, uh, uh, assemble
the other ingredients.

183
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:45,928
Now, um,

184
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,564
where do you keep
your virgin lamb's blood?

185
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:24,099
Mary?

186
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:32,913
I've seen you before.

187
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:34,948
Your sons, Sam and Dean,

188
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,683
they -- they sent me.

189
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:39,352
Are they here?
No.

190
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,792
My god.

191
00:10:45,794 --> 00:10:48,929
My name is Jack.

192
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,430
Jack...

193
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:56,469
Your mother...
was Kelly Kline?

194
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:58,838
You knew my mother?

195
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,576
I was there
when you were born.

196
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:07,213
And she, uh...

197
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:09,849
Died. I know.

198
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:12,185
You should
be 6 months old.

199
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:14,688
I am.

200
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,356
Sort of.

201
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:22,362
Jack, how did you
get here?

202
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,467
I opened a door.

203
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,636
To another world?
You can do that?

204
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:32,105
I -- Sam and Dean...

205
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:35,041
We were coming to save you,
but something went wrong,

206
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:38,044
and now it's just me.

207
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:40,547
And Michael, I...

208
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:44,284
I tried to fight him,
but he was in my head.

209
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,320
He wants me to use my powers,
but I don't know why.

210
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:52,258
I do.

211
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,629
You said he was in your head?
Well, he's in my head, too.

212
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:01,134
And I saw everything.

213
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:03,636
He's gonna bring an army
to our world and just...

214
00:12:03,638 --> 00:12:06,840
He wants me
to open the door.

215
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,678
But I won't.
He can't make me.

216
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,180
I-I don't care how much
he hurts me.

217
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,155
He's not gonna hurt you,
Jack.

218
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:23,823
He's gonna hurt <i>me.</i>

219
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,094
Why do you think
he brought you here?

220
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:31,297
So that we would meet,
so we would talk.

221
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:33,500
And then
when he comes back,

222
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,070
if you don't
do what he wants,

223
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:38,872
he's going to kill me.

224
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:44,310
You ready?

225
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:45,945
Yeah.

226
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:51,184
How are you holdin' up, Cass?

227
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:53,119
I'm fine.

228
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:55,755
No, I just mean with, you know,
everything you've been through.

229
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:59,526
And...I know you really
wanna find Lucifer.

230
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,662
No, it's not that.
It's about...

231
00:13:02,664 --> 00:13:05,498
Well, it is that,
but it's also I...

232
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,801
Dean, I was --
I was dead.

233
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:09,436
Temporarily.

234
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:12,639
And I have to believe that
I was brought back for a reason.

235
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:14,741
You were.

236
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:18,678
Okay, Jack brought you back
because we needed you back.

237
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,714
Right. And how have
I repaid him?

238
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:25,385
I promised his mother
that I would protect him,

239
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,887
but now he's trapped
in that place

240
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:30,757
while Lucifer is here,
who's...

241
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,860
I mean, he's getting stronger
and more powerful by the day.

242
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:37,564
And if Michael
really is coming,

243
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,100
maybe I was brought back
to help prepare.

244
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:42,302
Prepare for what?

245
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:45,472
War.

246
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:48,541
War is what Michael does.

247
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,314
Well, then we do
what we do.

248
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:58,751
Whatever it takes.

249
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:05,325
Okay, how we lookin'?

250
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:08,728
We still need the Dead Sea brine
and the, uh, wolfsbane.

251
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,064
On it.

252
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:21,341
All right, field in
the middle of nowhere --

253
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,109
Check.

254
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:26,346
What's next?

255
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:29,916
Well, Donatello said
that Gog and Magog

256
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:33,286
can only be killed by
a weapon touched by God,

257
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:34,621
so angel blade.

258
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:38,057
All right.
Let's rock and roll.

259
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:43,796
<i>Zoh nuh ray nuh rah juh.</i>

260
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,165
<i>Kohrahx oh.</i>

261
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,966
<i>Ee zee zohp ah.</i>

262
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,502
<i>Mah oh.</i>

263
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:52,705
<i>Ee vee gee.</i>

264
00:14:58,013 --> 00:14:59,579
Well, Enochian's
kind of tough.

265
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:03,116
Maybe you got a word wrong.
I don't get “words wrong”"

266
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,567
I told you.

267
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:24,037
This is serious.

268
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,873
Yeah, no, no, I-I-I know.
But...

269
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,276
They're wearing --
they're wearing loincloths.

270
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,847
Dean.

271
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:44,557
It's ancient --
ancient Canaanite.

272
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,559
They wanna know
if we brought armies.

273
00:15:46,561 --> 00:15:49,295
Armies?
To fight them.

274
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,678
Um...

275
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:09,449
W-what now?

276
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:12,218
Uh, they're...

277
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,887
They're arguing.
Ah.

278
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:16,823
Ask 'em where they got
their loincloths.

279
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,691
Dean.

280
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:30,069
It's like a flurry diaper.

281
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:32,138
Dean.

282
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,645
Eh.

283
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:44,851
- Uh, he just said that he's gonna -- he's gonna --
- No, I got it.

284
00:16:50,558 --> 00:16:52,058
Cass, what the hell?

285
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:56,729
He said their blades were
forged by a god.

286
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:01,501
Cool.

287
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:46,813
Forged by God,
touched by God, same thing.

288
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,583
Yeah.
Apparently.

289
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:01,494
Dean, we have a problem.

290
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:02,895
He isn't human.

291
00:18:02,897 --> 00:18:05,365
He appears
to be a primitive beast

292
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:08,868
formed of rock and sand.

293
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,370
That's a thing?

294
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,238
Yeah.

295
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,374
A very old thing.

296
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:17,310
I thought they had gone extinct
during the flood.

297
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:19,045
So what does this mean
for us?

298
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:22,715
It means...

299
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:24,550
they don't have hearts.

300
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:26,552
When Michael
comes back, you...

301
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:30,423
you let him kill me.

302
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:31,991
What?

303
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:37,663
Do not open that door.

304
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:39,599
No.

305
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:41,934
No, we're getting out
of here.

306
00:18:41,936 --> 00:18:44,137
We can't.
Yes, we can.

307
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,905
I-I'm strong.

308
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,407
I should be able to
save us both,

309
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:50,042
but every time I try
and use my powers here,

310
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:53,813
even things I know how to do,
it's all wrong.

311
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:55,815
It's just...

312
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:59,152
my head, it --
it doesn't stop pounding.

313
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:03,289
Your head hurts?

314
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,658
Mine, too. I...

315
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,493
I've had migraines ever since
they locked me in here.

316
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:11,164
I...thought it was from
the torture.

317
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:15,268
But maybe...

318
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,270
maybe this place
has wardings so strong

319
00:19:17,272 --> 00:19:18,771
that humans can feel it.

320
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,475
You think that's why
my powers aren't working?

321
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:24,076
My headache...

322
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:27,246
I have it everywhere except

323
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:29,015
right here.

324
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:31,784
This is the only place
it ever lets up.

325
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:34,754
Because the warding's weaker.

326
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:38,424
Worth a shot.

327
00:19:50,004 --> 00:19:51,337
It's working.

328
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:09,088
Okay. I think
that's everything.

329
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:14,126
Almost.

330
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:15,595
- Yah!
- Oh!

331
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:25,174
Find him and bring him
back to me.

332
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:27,326
And the woman?

333
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:30,897
Kill her,
in front of the boy.

334
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:32,565
Make her feel it.

335
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,371
Zachariah.

336
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:42,008
don't fail me again.

337
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:02,695
How far till we're safe?

338
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:05,665
Out here? I'm not sure
there's any such thing.

339
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,333
Wait!
Shh, shh, shh.

340
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:41,734
I think they're gone.

341
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:47,840
You angel, demon,
or human?

342
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:51,677
Human. We're human.

343
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:55,148
Mary Campbell?

344
00:21:57,018 --> 00:22:00,186
It's Bobby. Singer.

345
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:03,723
Bobby.

346
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:05,491
My boys...

347
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:07,193
they told me about you.

348
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,694
Your boys?

349
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:11,964
Dean and Sam Winchester.

350
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:15,701
Oh, I remember.
The daytrippers, right?

351
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:19,038
You called me Mary Campbell.

352
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,240
Do you know me?

353
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:24,076
Well, <i>knew</i> you,
the other you.

354
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:26,612
She...

355
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:30,883
Well, hell, I thought
you were a damn ghost.

356
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:33,686
Turns out you're just
from a whole other world,

357
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:38,925
which is...weirder
when you think about it.

358
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:40,393
Who's the kid?

359
00:22:40,395 --> 00:22:42,495
Um...

360
00:22:42,497 --> 00:22:44,397
I'm Jack.

361
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:46,666
Friend of the family.

362
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:50,736
Well, that's good enough
for me.

363
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:52,972
You better come with us.

364
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:04,684
Sam?

365
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:06,352
Sammy!

366
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:08,321
Hey.
Yeah, I'm right here.

367
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:10,523
Tried to get a hold of you.

368
00:23:10,525 --> 00:23:15,027
Yeah, well, um, I've been
a-a little busy, Dean. sorry.

369
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:16,562
What happened?

370
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:18,030
Donatello happened.

371
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:20,533
He...attacked me.

372
00:23:20,535 --> 00:23:22,969
The Muppet professor
attacked you? Why?

373
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:28,441
I better just show you.
Come here.

374
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:32,211
Must bear witness
to possess ability of it.

375
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:35,781
To protect it.

376
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:39,752
Yes. Protect them both.

377
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:42,388
The power has been given you to

378
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,858
tread...upon...your...enemies!

379
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,227
He attacked me.
I didn't wanna hurt him,

380
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:51,631
but he -- he just kept on
coming at me, and...biting.

381
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:54,066
So I had to lock him up
in there.

382
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:57,336
We were prepping the spell, and he just snapped.

383
00:23:57,338 --> 00:24:00,273
- Yeah, I think it's all a set up.
- What?

384
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:02,275
Gog and Magog, they can't be
part of the spell.

385
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:05,044
- 'Cause they don't have hearts.
- That...

386
00:24:05,046 --> 00:24:07,079
Wait a second.
Then why did he...

387
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:11,350
Because Donatello
wanted them to kill us.

388
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:14,387
He wants us dead.

389
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:26,232
Well... welcome
to home, sweet home.

390
00:24:27,802 --> 00:24:29,969
What happened to them?

391
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:32,004
Angels happened.

392
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:34,173
Angels did this?

393
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:35,808
They've done worse.

394
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,745
Two days ago, angels dive-bombed
a colony in San Antonio.

395
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:41,213
400 people.

396
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:43,883
Not a soul left alive.

397
00:24:43,885 --> 00:24:48,020
This ain't a war.
This is an extermination.

398
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:50,923
Bobby...

399
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:54,961
Michael,
he'll be lookin' for us.

400
00:24:54,963 --> 00:24:56,729
Don't worry.

401
00:24:56,731 --> 00:25:00,099
We got protocols
protecting us.

402
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:03,269
Wardings,
lookouts in the trees,

403
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:05,671
few other tricks
up our sleeves.

404
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:07,673
Besides,

405
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:11,277
Mary Campbell saved my ass
more than a few times.

406
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:17,650
It'd be rude
not to return the favor.

407
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,125
Donnie,
what happened, man?

408
00:25:26,127 --> 00:25:28,427
- I thought we were friends.
- Friend?

409
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:31,330
I see how you,
<i>both</i> of you, look at me.

410
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:33,366
Covetous.

411
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:35,067
Well..

412
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,470
<i>God didn't choose you</i>
<i>for this part, Dean.</i>

413
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:41,340
<i>He chose me.</i>

414
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:42,675
<i>Donatello,</i>

415
00:25:42,677 --> 00:25:44,210
<i>whatever it is you're feeling,</i>

416
00:25:44,212 --> 00:25:46,212
<i>whatever it is</i>
<i>you're going through,</i>

417
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:47,847
you can fight this.

418
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,815
I don't wanna
fight it. I...

419
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:52,084
You're supposed
to be dead.

420
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:54,720
Sorry about that.

421
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:58,691
Was it the tablet that --
that did this to you or...

422
00:25:58,693 --> 00:26:02,628
It didn't do <i>anything</i> to me.

423
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,631
<i>I translated the tablet.</i>
<i>All of it!</i>

424
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:09,568
<i>I saw the power of God!</i>
<i>And it's all up here.</i>

425
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,238
And you wanna take it from me.

426
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,407
No, we don't.

427
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:16,909
That's not true.
We -- we just wanna help you.

428
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,811
No.

429
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,780
You just brought me here
to use me

430
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:23,983
and to get your precious
spell back.

431
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:26,819
You're wasting your time.

432
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:30,289
And if it's a little magic
you wanna be seein'...

433
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,991
<i>Suffocetur.</i>

434
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:36,762
Donatello, listen, we...

435
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:42,268
Dean?

436
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,570
Dean! Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!

437
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:48,674
Dean?

438
00:26:52,013 --> 00:26:54,013
Dean! Dean!

439
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:55,848
Dean!

440
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,518
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

441
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,112
Go easy.
I added a nip of whiskey.

442
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:37,223
I don't mean to stare.
Just...

443
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:40,593
You... you look
just like her.

444
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:42,661
Give or take
a year or two.

445
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:46,966
What was she like?

446
00:27:46,968 --> 00:27:49,368
Mary Campbell was a...

447
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,371
complicated woman.

448
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:55,007
Mm.

449
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:58,878
Brave, but sad.

450
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,646
Full of regret.

451
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:05,518
Let me guess --

452
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,486
she made a bad demon deal?

453
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:10,656
Opposite.
She didn't make one.

454
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:14,960
Lost the love of her life.

455
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:16,929
Never moved on.

456
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:21,400
And Dean and Sam
were never born.

457
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:28,007
Bobby, I made that deal.

458
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,645
And it -- <i>I...</i>

459
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:36,081
brought my boys a...
lot of pain.

460
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,716
But...

461
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:43,122
What happened here,
in your world?

462
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:46,125
Sam and Dean stopped
that war in mine.

463
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:51,430
Then I'd say you made
the right choice.

464
00:28:54,135 --> 00:28:55,768
Oh.

465
00:28:57,371 --> 00:29:01,073
Well, I don't know much,
but...

466
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:04,710
I do know you done good
by your boys.

467
00:29:04,712 --> 00:29:06,212
They hadn't been here
five minutes

468
00:29:06,214 --> 00:29:07,780
when they were trying
to convince me

469
00:29:07,782 --> 00:29:10,115
to come back with them
to their world.

470
00:29:10,117 --> 00:29:13,319
But you said “no.”

471
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,757
Mary...

472
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,460
your world's got your boys.

473
00:29:21,462 --> 00:29:24,730
This place?

474
00:29:24,732 --> 00:29:27,299
I'm pretty much
all it's got.

475
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:34,139
Whoa!

476
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:35,975
Ooh!

477
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,679
Whoa!

478
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:43,282
What is he?
A witch? Psychic?

479
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:44,783
Ooh!

480
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:48,354
Jack's a nephilim.

481
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:52,891
Excuse me?

482
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:56,095
He...
he's...half-angel, half --

483
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:58,230
I know what it means.

484
00:29:58,232 --> 00:29:59,732
What I don't get is
why the hell

485
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:02,101
you would bring one
into my camp.

486
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:04,336
You know what angels
have done to us.

487
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:07,706
I...I trusted you.

488
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:12,378
I want him gone by morning.

489
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,980
If he goes,

490
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,383
I go with him.

491
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:19,618
Well, then that's
your choice.

492
00:30:21,355 --> 00:30:23,088
Yeah.

493
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,192
Look, Mary,
when this all started,

494
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:31,563
when Lucifer and his demon army
rose out of hell,

495
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:35,200
we thought the angels
were on our side.

496
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:40,005
But one by one,
they turned on us.

497
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:42,174
He will, too.

498
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,343
It's just a matter of time.

499
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:49,315
All right,
what else do we know

500
00:30:49,317 --> 00:30:52,718
besides all work and no play
makes Donatello a homicidal boy?

501
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,586
Maybe...
Well, maybe something

502
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:57,022
in the -- the tablet
snapped him.

503
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,191
No, no.
Prophets are conduits.

504
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:03,162
Whatever's in the tablet
should just flow through them.

505
00:31:03,164 --> 00:31:05,564
I heard of one
who was tempted once,

506
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:07,533
but never fully corrupted.

507
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:09,902
Well, Kevin translated it,
and it was hard on him, sure,

508
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:12,137
but he -- he never went
full-on psycho.

509
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:15,374
Okay, so what was different
about Donatello?

510
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:19,611
He doesn't have a soul.

511
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:21,313
What?

512
00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:23,182
Is that bad?

513
00:31:23,184 --> 00:31:25,551
Yes, that's bad.

514
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:27,720
Theoretically,
the -- the human soul

515
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:29,855
would act as a filter,
inoculating the prophet

516
00:31:29,857 --> 00:31:33,158
against whatever darkness
is in the tablet.

517
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,095
All right. Um, well,
how do we fix him?

518
00:31:36,097 --> 00:31:38,097
I don't think we do.

519
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,232
Okay.

520
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:42,000
Hold on.

521
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:44,436
We were so close.

522
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:47,573
We almost had it.

523
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,408
What are you talkin' about?

524
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,378
Our plan, Dean.

525
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,781
The spell, get Mom back.
Donatello's soul is gone.

526
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:57,649
That's not just something
you come back from.

527
00:31:57,651 --> 00:32:00,052
- You did.
- Yeah, because you convinced Death

528
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:01,920
to get my soul
back from the cage,

529
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:04,490
but Amara ate
Donatello's soul.

530
00:32:04,492 --> 00:32:06,792
There's nothing <i>to</i> get back.
It's gone.

531
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:09,695
And Donatello's
already corrupted.

532
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:12,364
I...Perhaps
the kindest thing to do

533
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:15,701
would be
to end his suffering.

534
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:17,169
What?

535
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:19,505
I don't like it either.

536
00:32:19,507 --> 00:32:21,240
But if Donatello's life ends,

537
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:23,008
then another prophet
comes into being

538
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,477
and they can finish
the translation.

539
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,212
- So what, you just wanna kill him?
- No! No killing!

540
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,884
We just need the spell.

541
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:39,324
- Fine.
- Cass.

542
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:41,226
What are you doing?

543
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:43,061
What I have to.

544
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,766
Hey.

545
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:49,134
Cass!

546
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:53,105
Cass.

547
00:32:53,107 --> 00:32:54,440
Cass.

548
00:32:54,442 --> 00:32:55,974
Cass.

549
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,776
Cass! Come on, let us in!

550
00:32:57,778 --> 00:32:59,778
Cass!

551
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,180
Oh, come on.

552
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:19,898
You really like it here.

553
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,201
These people...

554
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:24,203
Everyone's so brave.

555
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,172
But we can't stay.

556
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:29,508
Why not?

557
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,346
Because of me?

558
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:37,983
I'm sorry, Jack.
It's not fair.

559
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,057
Get to cover!

560
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:48,193
We got incoming!

561
00:33:58,124 --> 00:33:59,857
Michael!

562
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:01,759
- Run!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

563
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:06,831
The spell
to open the gate --

564
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:09,066
you gave us
the wrong ingredients.

565
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:11,135
Duh.

566
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:13,938
But you know the right ones.

567
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,639
I might.

568
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:19,143
But like I told Sam and Dean,
you're wasting your time.

569
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:24,415
Well, I'm not Sam and Dean.

570
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:26,283
What are you gonna do?

571
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:30,488
I am going to do something that
I promised I would never do

572
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,124
to a human being
without their permission.

573
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:35,693
I'm gonna strip the spell
from your mind.

574
00:34:35,695 --> 00:34:39,497
You -- you -- you -- you can't.
I-I've absorbed too much power.

575
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:41,699
Y-y-you'll fry us both!

576
00:34:41,701 --> 00:34:43,534
I might.

577
00:34:44,971 --> 00:34:47,905
<i>Ardeat intus --</i>

578
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:51,108
I'm sorry, but I'm not
going to let you

579
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,677
or anyone hurt
the people I love.

580
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,246
Not again.

581
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,264
You -- This is <i>your</i> fault.

582
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:15,866
- What?
- He used his powers.

583
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:17,434
Must've been
how they found us.

584
00:35:17,436 --> 00:35:20,271
I didn't...
I didn't mean to.

585
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:22,339
Well, ain't that just gravy.

586
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:24,408
What can we do to help?

587
00:35:26,078 --> 00:35:28,679
Here. Take this.

588
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:29,914
There's a grain cellar,

589
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,782
escape tunnels
running underneath.

590
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:34,652
Round up any kids you can find,
get 'em safe.

591
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:36,520
I'll come with you.

592
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:38,189
You've done enough.

593
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:42,993
Jack...the angels,

594
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:45,496
we can't let them find you,
so just...

595
00:35:45,498 --> 00:35:47,331
find some place and hide.

596
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:50,768
Okay.

597
00:35:59,512 --> 00:36:01,212
Cass?

598
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,020
Well, I know
what we have to do.

599
00:36:28,874 --> 00:36:32,409
Find the child. Kill the rest.

600
00:36:46,692 --> 00:36:48,392
Okay.

601
00:36:48,394 --> 00:36:50,961
Shh, shh, shh. I've got you.

602
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:52,596
Mary Winchester.

603
00:36:52,598 --> 00:36:55,933
Run!

604
00:36:55,935 --> 00:36:57,901
Okay.

605
00:37:01,374 --> 00:37:04,241
The half-breed...

606
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:05,609
Where is he?

607
00:37:09,515 --> 00:37:10,948
Go to hell.

608
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,249
Witty.

609
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:14,618
Stop!

610
00:37:15,955 --> 00:37:18,322
Perfect timing.

611
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:21,025
Enjoy the show.

612
00:37:21,027 --> 00:37:23,627
I said...stop.

613
00:37:44,183 --> 00:37:45,949
More incoming!

614
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:47,484
No.

615
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:15,489
Well, I don't know what to say
except thank you.

616
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:19,293
Jack, what you did
was amazing.

617
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,898
I had to come back.

618
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,835
Sam and Dean,
they wouldn't run.

619
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:29,503
They'd stay and fight.

620
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:32,539
These angels, what they're
doing, they're not gonna stop.

621
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:35,109
As long
as Michael's out there,

622
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:37,344
this war will never be over.

623
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:40,147
So what are you saying?

624
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:44,885
I have to kill him.

625
00:39:03,472 --> 00:39:05,172
Well?

626
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:12,746
Well...

627
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:15,516
Guess you could say
Donatello is alive.

628
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:18,252
You told me
not to kill him.

629
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:21,155
Yeah, but, Cass,
you turned him in...

630
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:23,958
He's brain dead.

631
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,327
Machines keeping him
breathing.

632
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:28,262
What's wrong with you?

633
00:39:29,498 --> 00:39:31,832
Nothing.
Cass --

634
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:34,401
His soul was gone.
He was corrupted.

635
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:36,603
He was a danger to himself

636
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:38,872
and to you
and to all of humanity.

637
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,945
Did you know that he was
working with Asmodeus?

638
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:47,548
What? No.

639
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,517
Not by choice, but he was.

640
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:55,556
Some people
just can't be saved.

641
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:58,025
Yeah, but who gets to
make that choice? You?

642
00:39:59,662 --> 00:40:01,328
What exactly
gives you the right?

643
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,531
Nothing. I took it.

644
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:06,767
And if I hadn't acted,
we would still be sitting around

645
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:08,602
and <i>talking</i> about
what to do next.

646
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:11,338
We would be wasting time.

647
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,574
And it's time
we <i>don't</i> have, Dean.

648
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:17,311
I told you, war is coming.

649
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:19,546
War.

650
00:40:19,548 --> 00:40:22,116
And I did what soldiers do.

651
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:26,420
Now we needed the spell
to open the rift,

652
00:40:26,422 --> 00:40:28,889
and I got it.

653
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:31,125
We need four
major ingredients --

654
00:40:31,127 --> 00:40:33,594
the grace of an archangel...

655
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:39,366
a fruit
from the Tree of Life...

656
00:40:41,303 --> 00:40:42,736
the Seal of Solomon...

657
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:49,076
and the blood of
“a most holy man”"

658
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:51,545
We find those things,

659
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:53,514
we can
bring everybody home.

660
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:58,185
And together, we can beat
Lucifer <i>and</i> Michael.

661
00:40:59,522 --> 00:41:03,290
This is the only way we win,

662
00:41:03,292 --> 00:41:07,227
and this is the only way
we survive.

663
00:41:09,665 --> 00:41:13,534
It's like you said, Dean.

664
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:17,237
Whatever it takes.

665
