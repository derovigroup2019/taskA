1
00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:01,278
They call me Gabriel.

2
00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:04,270
I thought you were dead.

3
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:08,541
- We saw him die.
- Please.

4
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:10,577
You can't take the trick
out of The Trickster.

5
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:12,545
Trickster's like
a Hugh Hefner type, right?

6
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:15,415
Wine, women, song. Maybe he
doesn't want the party to end.

7
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:16,883
I mean, maybe he hates
this angels and demons stuff

8
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:19,252
as much as we do.
Let me guess.

9
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:21,321
You two muttonheads
broke the world,

10
00:00:21,323 --> 00:00:23,756
and you want me
to sweep up your mess.

11
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:26,392
Yes. Why don't you sack up
and help us take down Lucifer?

12
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,294
I can't kill my brother.

13
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:30,130
Can't or won't?

14
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:31,865
Guard this with your life.

15
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:33,566
<i>If you're watching this,</i>
<i>I'm dead.</i>

16
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:37,403
<i>Without me, you got zero shot</i>
<i>at killing Lucifer.</i>

17
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,838
<i>But you can trap him.</i>

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,175
I know you think
it's safer inside.

19
00:00:42,177 --> 00:00:44,544
I <i>broke</i> you!
No more torture. No more pain.

20
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:46,146
I've been there.

21
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:47,547
I can feel him!

22
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,082
Sammy's long gone.

23
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:52,785
But, Gabriel,
the world needs you.

24
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:55,455
Please, help us.

25
00:00:55,457 --> 00:00:57,957
There was a demon
incursion led by Asmodeus.

26
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:00,260
And Gabriel killed him.

27
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:01,728
Where is he?

28
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,631
We asked Gabriel
to help us, and he said no.

29
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:06,966
Son of a bitch!

30
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:08,835
Every time!

31
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,453
Ahh.

32
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:41,167
Fenrir Odensbane!

33
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,313
Gabriel.

34
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:03,523
I assume you're not here
to apologize.

35
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:06,492
Ya think?

36
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,938
I vowed
to do this honorably.

37
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,007
No gimmicks.

38
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:22,475
No tricks.

39
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:25,511
Just mano...

40
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:26,779
a-mano.

41
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:56,476
Ha!

42
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,614
Here, boy.

43
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:02,949
Aah!

44
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:08,755
Aah! Aah!

45
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:13,826
Never known an archangel
to bleed.

46
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:16,129
Ya got me.

47
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:22,702
Ah!

00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,714
Yeah.
No, we just got in. Mm-hmm.

51
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:09,682
What are you doing?
Don't unpack.

52
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,985
Dude, we could be here
for days.

53
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,521
No. No. Hey, hell, no.
Hey -- No, not you. That's...

54
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:18,291
Just call us when you get
to Amarillo, all right?

55
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:20,093
All right, look,

56
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,762
Rowena's spell said that
Gabriel would be here.

57
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,564
Yeah, here or in Texas.

58
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,966
Yeah, she tracked his essence --
which, gross -- to both places.

59
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:28,735
So Cass is gonna hit up
the Lone Star State

60
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:30,770
in a few hours, and we will
check this place out.

61
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:33,773
- Okay. And that could take some time.
- Which we don't have.

62
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,775
Look, I know you know that
we've been following leads

63
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,977
for the past two weeks.
We have nothing to show for it.

64
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,214
Meanwhile, Mom, Jack,
they could be hurt.

65
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:42,782
Or worse.

66
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,550
And we're stuck here in
this stupid motel room...

67
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:45,885
doing...

68
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:55,461
Bonus.

69
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:59,932
...looking for some runaway,
dumbass archangel

70
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:01,768
who doesn't wanna be found.

71
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,911
Hey, fellas.

72
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:13,379
Looking for me?

73
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:21,854
Balthazar's army attacked,
but we were ready.

74
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,456
And then I...

75
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,792
I killed him.

76
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:27,226
And Bobby?

77
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:28,694
Well, he'll be back
in a few days

78
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,763
with the people that we saved.
How many?

79
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,298
30 at least.

80
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,434
You're not happy?

81
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:36,302
This is the third battle
in a row that we've won.

82
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:39,005
Jack, I know. I...

83
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:41,774
We're running out
of space and supplies.

84
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,709
And now with
all those new people,

85
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:47,079
I just...don't know how we're
gonna take care of everybody.

86
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,650
Sorry.

87
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:53,486
Didn't mean to startle you.

88
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:55,188
What is it, Jakob?

89
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,523
Just got word from the eyes
outside Michael's fortress.

90
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:58,925
And?

91
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:00,626
They're saying the angels,
they're leaving.

92
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,731
Why would they leave?

93
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:10,236
All right, this is
gonna hurt a little bit.

94
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:12,538
A little?

95
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,006
How'd you know
we were here?

96
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,776
Come on. I felt
your witch's tracking spell

97
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:18,911
the second
she laid it on me.

98
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,379
Tasted like haggis.

99
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,848
So now you're in trouble?

100
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,749
What gave you that idea?

101
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,419
You show up on our doorstep,
bleeding like a stuck pig.

102
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:29,789
This? Eh, you know, you...

103
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,824
roll into town for
a little R&R,

104
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,593
stumble into
the wrong poker game,

105
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,761
take a guy's money,
his wife...

106
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,196
things get messy.

107
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:39,699
You're trying to tell us
you came <i>here</i> for R&R?

108
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:41,701
Yeah, this isn't exactly
the Riviera.

109
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:43,903
I know, right? Huh.

110
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:45,705
Yeah, so anyway, um...

111
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:47,173
I don't suppose
you guys have

112
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:49,509
any more of my grace
laying around, right?

113
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:52,478
'Cause, uh, the tank's
a little low.

114
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,114
Oh, did you drain it
killing Asmodeus?

115
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:57,049
And ditching you.

116
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,518
It'll recharge. Eventually.

117
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,088
But, uh, until then...

118
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,358
Whatever we didn't use on you,
we used to open up a rift.

119
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,964
Cool.

120
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:14,100
Superdupes. Okay.
Well, uh,

121
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:16,302
in that case, gentlemen,

122
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,304
I must bid you a fond adi--

123
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:20,239
Ohh!

124
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,941
Yeah, nope.

125
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:24,744
Maybe after a...

126
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:27,647
little siesta.

127
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,081
Whoa.

128
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,917
Aw.

129
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,420
Aw, crap.

130
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:41,460
Died as he lived --

131
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,129
side by side
with the bottle.

132
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:48,401
So little respect
for our brother.

133
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:49,936
Well, at least
he got a few licks in

134
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:51,537
before the shivving.

135
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:03,182
This is archangel blood.

136
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,919
Better call father.

137
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,168
It's all empty.

138
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,769
You're sure?

139
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,639
There are a few angels
guarding the perimeter,

140
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,175
but inside...

141
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:30,610
they're gone.

142
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:33,479
What is going on?

143
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:36,582
Maybe...maybe he's scared.

144
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,884
We've been fighting Michael
the better part of eight years.

145
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:41,020
There is <i>nothing</i>
he is scared of.

146
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:45,524
He's scared of me.

147
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,196
I'm winning.

148
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:51,998
Jack --

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,301
I think we should go, see if
Michael left anything behind,

150
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:57,403
something that can tell us

151
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:59,372
where he's gone,
what he's planning.

152
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:01,073
It could be a trap.

153
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:04,443
It's all right.
I'll keep you safe.

154
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:12,051
Until his grace levels
come back up,

155
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:15,388
I-I just...

156
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,756
I don't get it.

157
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:18,257
Yeah, well, right now,
don't care.

158
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,059
He's here, and we're gonna
keep him here.

159
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:23,396
Where?!
Where am I?

160
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,699
Oh, right.

161
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:29,268
You.

162
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,370
Gabriel, look,

163
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:34,073
we don't really know
what's going on here --

164
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,441
We need your help.

165
00:09:35,443 --> 00:09:38,778
Uh...yeah,
not a big joiner.

166
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,347
Oh, so you got better things
to do than save the world?

167
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:44,116
Exactly.

168
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:47,887
Look, this has been...
great, a real thrill.

169
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:50,990
But, uh, I just came here
for the silver stuff.

170
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:53,993
And since you two are
all fresh out,

171
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:56,195
it's time for me to say
sayonara.

172
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,439
Raspberries.

173
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,442
We're here for the angel.

174
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,152
The hell are you guys?
The hell are these guys?

175
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,221
Oh, just a couple of
Norse demigods.

176
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,522
Demigods?!

177
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,857
Ah!

178
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,699
Gabriel, little help
in here!

179
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,171
Sammy!

180
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,962
Hiya, handsome.

181
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,430
You ready to die?

182
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,268
Ooh.

183
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,905
You okay?
Uh, yeah.

184
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:19,109
I'll go after him in a sec.
I just...need a minute.

185
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,978
Wrong.

186
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,481
You're not goin' anywhere.

187
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,060
Clear over here.

188
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,632
All clear.

189
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,801
Jakob, take the others.
Check the warding.

190
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,176
Really hate
this place.

191
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,977
Look.

192
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,690
Well, those are
Michael's armies.

193
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:10,027
Why are they
all over there?

194
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,996
I don't know.

195
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,067
Look who we found
in the dungeon.

196
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,637
The prophet.

197
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,507
Kevin Tran.

198
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,114
He's a traitor!

199
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,582
I'm -- I'm a prophet
of the lord.

200
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,118
I was serving God --
You serve <i>Michael.</i>

201
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,221
Prophet here turned his back
on own kind.

202
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,157
I didn't have a choice! I...

203
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,595
Y-you don't understand. I...I...

204
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,430
I never used to believe
in anything.

205
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,831
Well, ex-except science --

206
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,266
quantum mechanical
unpredictably.

207
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,101
But then the end
of the world happened,

208
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,738
and everyone around me --
my friends, and my...my mom --

209
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,173
they all started to die.

210
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,176
But God chose <i>me?</i> What...

211
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,677
What does that even mean?!

212
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,115
Michael said he wanted to save
the world, not kill it.

213
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,117
But he...

214
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,320
he hurt so many people.

215
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,524
When I couldn't perfect
the spell,

216
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,826
Michael, he got mad
and threw me in the dungeon.

217
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:19,763
And I was so scared,
but I fixed it.

218
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,032
B-but I...

219
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,534
I couldn't
do it anymore.

220
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,403
Kevin...
And then he...he...

221
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,941
What spell?

222
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,378
What's Michael planning?

223
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,684
There's a place
in the south

224
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,986
where the walls
between worlds are thin.

225
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,989
Michael's gonna use a spell
from the angel tablet

226
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,092
to open up the rift,
and then he's g--

227
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,861
He'll invade our world.

228
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,134
You know...

229
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,836
you guys are lucky
I'm low on juice,

230
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,538
considering what I did to
the last guy who locked me up.

231
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,907
You know what?
We said we'd let you go,

232
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,643
just as soon as you tell us
what the hell is going on here.

233
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,378
Yeah, it, uh...

234
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,247
it's not a fun story.

235
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,850
Well, we just broke into
a junkyard

236
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,652
and stuffed the body of
a demigod into a car crusher,

237
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,689
so I think you owe us
some answers.

238
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,261
Okay, they're not really
demigods.

239
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,929
Mm.

240
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,565
Look, the Norse pantheon
is its own weird thing.

241
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,702
Think of 'em more like, uh,
god-begotten monsters.

242
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,837
Whatever.
What did they want with you?

243
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,975
I killed their brother.

244
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,943
Why?

245
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,745
Remember when I told you
what happened

246
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,882
after I faked my death
at the Elysian Motel?

247
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,450
Yeah, of course.

248
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,085
You went to, uh, Monte Carlo
with a bunch of porn stars.

249
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,087
Uh-huh.
Yeah...

250
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,056
well, I left
a few parts out.

251
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,760
<i>After Lucifer, quotation marks, killed me,</i>

252
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,428
<i>I needed to lay low.</i>

253
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,298
<i>Luckily, I used to hang</i>
<i>with a pretty resourceful crew.</i>

254
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,101
<i>Found me a real</i>
<i>top-shelf hideaway.</i>

255
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,805
I'm calling it.
I'm calling, all right?

256
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,008
Ohh.

257
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,910
Aw, come on!

258
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,345
<i>Skol.</i>
Gentlemen...

259
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,948
No! What?!

260
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,883
Oh, no!
Come on.

261
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,019
<i>I thought this story had porn stars.</i>

262
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,553
<i>Ah!</i>

263
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,988
<i>Good catch. My bad.</i>

264
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,628
Mmm.

265
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,664
I'm -- I'm calling,
all right?

266
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,866
Ohh.

267
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,768
Aw, come on!

268
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,970
<i>Skol.</i>
Gentlemen...

269
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,539
Ooh!
You're kidding me!

270
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,007
Oh, ho!
I knew it!

271
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,710
Hey, come on.

272
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,045
<i>I had it made --</i>

273
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,947
<i>all the booze I could drink,</i>

274
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,817
<i>all the, uh, entertainment</i>
<i>I could handle.</i>

275
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:57,020
Okay! Why don't we just
skip to the end?

276
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,729
<i>So this is how</i>
<i>it ended.</i>

277
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,210
Aah!
<i>By the time I came to,</i>

278
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,446
<i>they had sold me to Asmodeus.</i>

279
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,815
<i>Why would they do that?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

280
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,616
Lucifer?

281
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,051
In case you don't remember,

282
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,187
there was an apocalypse
brewing at the time.

283
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,522
We remember.
Well, Vegas odds had my bro

284
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,624
pulling off a big win.

285
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,394
Yeah? And whose fault was that?

286
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,998
Mm.
Fenrir, Sleipnir, and Narfi

287
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,667
were just trying to cover
their keisters.

288
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,335
They needed
to get rid of me

289
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,270
before Lucifer figured out
where they had me hidden.

290
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:51,441
But <i>selling</i> me to
that Kentucky Fried B-hole?

291
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,311
For them?
That was all profit.

292
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,279
So you want revenge.

293
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,281
Well, <i>obviously.</i>

294
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,251
Roasting Asmodeus was, uh,
satisfying for a hot minute.

295
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,453
But you know one thing better
than killing him?

296
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,088
Slaughtering them all.

297
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,425
But since you're low on grace,
you had to do it

298
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:12,095
the old-fashioned way --
with wood.

299
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,198
Don't let anybody ever tell you
you're just a pretty face.

300
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,070
All right, anyway,
if there are only, uh,

301
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,673
three gods or monsters
or whatever,

302
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,710
how come there are four swords?

303
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,678
Oh. That top one?

304
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,782
That is for
the man with the plan,

305
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,316
the architect of my torture,

306
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,353
and my own personal
public enemy numero uno.

307
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,725
Their papa...

308
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,126
<i>Loki.</i>

309
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,594
Jakob's right.

310
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,196
Leaving his plans like this?
It's too sloppy.

311
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,432
- Or he doesn't care.
- Doesn't care?

312
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,933
He knows
we can't stop him.

313
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,468
He's probably making his move
as we speak.

314
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,903
No, I can go, right now.

315
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,504
If I can surprise Michael,
I can kill him.

316
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,340
- Jack, <i>no.</i>
- No, we can't let him cross over.

317
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,875
I know, but --
We know where he is.

318
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,778
Do we? Michael could've
left this map as bait.

319
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,147
Bobby's only a day out.

320
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,615
We should wait.

321
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,985
Mary's right.

322
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:12,322
Michael, he...never does
anything without a reason.

323
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,191
I say
we let the archangel go.

324
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,526
Let Michael be some other
world's problem for a change.

325
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,994
How can you even say that?

326
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,697
That's 7 billion
innocent people.

327
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,936
Jack, listen to me.

328
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,105
This is Michael
we're talking about.

329
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,074
He's killed everyone that's
ever stood against him.

330
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,043
We have to think this
through.

331
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,613
I'm asking for a day.

332
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,885
Please.

333
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,026
Hold on.

334
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,863
I thought Loki was <i>you.</i>

335
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,931
It's trippy, I know.

336
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:58,368
Look, remember when I told you
I went into witness protection?

337
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,903
Well, who do you think
put me there?

338
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,304
Loki?

339
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,940
You and Loki are friends?

340
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,609
Oh, well...

341
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,545
We were.

342
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:13,016
A few thousand epochs ago, I was
out for a hike in the fjords.

343
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,185
Came across
Loki bound in a cave,

344
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,421
snake dripping venom
into his eye.

345
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,923
Ugh.

346
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,858
Apparently, he had
some spat with his pops.

347
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,895
Anyhoo, I freed him.

348
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,329
Saved his life.

349
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,465
Then my real brothers
started going at it.

350
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,167
I wanted out.

351
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,738
Loki owed me one, so...

352
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,608
he helped me ditch Gabriel
and become him.

353
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,113
So then you took on his whole...
trickster vibe.

354
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,284
What did Loki do while
you were impersonating him?

355
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,853
Oh. Well, he had his own
family drama to worry about.

356
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,089
It was in his best interest
to go off the grid for a while.

357
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,724
But you saw him
in Monte Carlo.

358
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:58,061
Well, I needed
someplace to hide.

359
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,829
He'd already helped me
the once.

360
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,801
You know, none of this would've
happened if you'd had just...

361
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,871
stuck around and helped us
fight Lucifer.

362
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,240
Hey, I did help you.

363
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,908
“Casa Erotica”?

364
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,977
You call that help?
I call that art.

365
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,079
But yes, without me,

366
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,315
you two chuckleheads
never would've known

367
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,116
how to throw Lucifer
back in the Cage.

368
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,452
But instead of giving us
a hand, you ran.

369
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,588
And you just did it again when
you ditched us in the bunker.

370
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,122
All right, Dean --
I have more important things to do

371
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,091
than to join your little
band of merry men.

372
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,193
Hey, what you're doing? This?
This is not important.

373
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,863
<i>Every day,</i>
Asmodeus tortured me.

374
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:36,566
Every...day!

375
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,669
He fed off my grace
for years!

376
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,939
He <i>used</i> me, he <i>debased</i> me
until I was...

377
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:54,184
What I went through...

378
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,319
you don't forgive.

379
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,189
Everyone who had
a hand in it will die.

380
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,857
Get me?

381
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,560
Yeah. We do.

382
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,197
Okay, you went through it.

383
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,999
We get it. All right?

384
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,435
But killing Loki?
Not gonna change any of that.

385
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,872
It's not. In fact, probably not
even gonna make you feel better.

386
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,809
Well, agree to disagree,
Dean-o.

387
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,078
We all have our demons.

388
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,548
Mine are here, in this town.

389
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,084
Okay.

390
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,021
But...you're low on grace.

391
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,889
And Loki
knows you're coming.

392
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,291
Sam.

393
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,829
What?

394
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,331
Not like I care about
killing gods, okay?

395
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,768
But this whole revenge kick?
It's a waste of time.

396
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,671
What if it's not?

397
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,607
You've seen it, Sam --
with me, with Dad.

398
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,310
Revenge only ends
one way -- ugly.

399
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,744
Well, maybe it doesn't
have to.

400
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,180
Okay, I think I know
what this is.

401
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,848
Okay, what is this?
You.

402
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,418
You're you're so hopped up on
this “Kill Bill” fantasy of his.

403
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,520
No, no, no. This has
nothing to do with me.

404
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,889
If you had a shot at Lucifer,
you wouldn't take it?

405
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,691
Of course I would.

406
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,794
But this is about Gabriel.

407
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,729
He needs our help.

408
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,401
Gabriel,
you agree to help us,

409
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,770
we'll agree to help you.

410
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,713
Hmm.

411
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:48,270
All right, Uma,
what's the plan?

412
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:50,339
Well, Sleipnir's a lot
of things,

413
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:53,575
but mainly,
he is a coward.

414
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:56,845
I will bet all the personal
lubricant in the S.F.V...

415
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:58,380
that after we killed Narfi,

416
00:22:58,382 --> 00:23:02,151
he ran straight back
to papa's skirts.

417
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:04,186
So he and Loki
will be together.

418
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:06,355
That's great.
How do we find them?

419
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:08,090
Uh, they're about a...

420
00:23:08,092 --> 00:23:09,491
5-minute drive from here.

421
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:10,993
Penthouse of
the Ophidian Hotel.

422
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:12,961
Seriously?
You've known this whole time?

423
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:15,364
Sure.
That's what Loki does.

424
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:18,233
He rolls into a dump town,
finds the seediest motel,

425
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:19,668
<i>then uses some mojo</i>
<i>to give it</i>

426
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,270
<i>his patented</i>
<i>Cinderella treatment.</i>

427
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:32,181
<i>Loki has his fun,</i>
<i>then he moves on.</i>

428
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:34,350
I've been tracking him
since Amarillo.

429
00:23:34,352 --> 00:23:37,186
And you didn't go after him.
Why?

430
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:39,822
'Cause that's...ah...

431
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:45,027
For the most satisfying
retributive experience,

432
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:48,797
everyone knows you don't take on
the Big Bad from the jump.

433
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,633
You work up to him,
like so.

434
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,844
What am I lookin' at?

435
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,848
You -- you've never seen
a kill list before?

436
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,783
Wow.

437
00:24:07,785 --> 00:24:09,485
Hmm. Okay.

438
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:12,020
There's Fenrir, Narfi,

439
00:24:12,022 --> 00:24:14,923
Sleipnir, and then last
but not least, Loki.

440
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:16,558
I'm killing all of his sons
in order.

441
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,093
And then, when he's got
nothing left,

442
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:19,762
I take him out.

443
00:24:21,432 --> 00:24:22,931
This is so stupid.

444
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:25,267
Really? Is it?

445
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:26,869
'Cause let me tell you something.

446
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:29,204
Seven years is a long-ass time
for me to plan

447
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,473
my own personal brand
of vengeance.

448
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:32,941
So if you guys aren't
gonna get onboard...

449
00:24:32,943 --> 00:24:35,344
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

450
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:38,147
We're 'rboard. Right, Dean?

451
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:42,117
I'm sorry. What was that?

452
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:46,288
Sure.

453
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,257
Peachy.

454
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:49,691
So here's
what we're gonna do.

455
00:24:49,693 --> 00:24:51,760
We go in, we kill Sleipnir,
and then,

456
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:54,530
we surprise Big Daddy
in the penthouse.

457
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,801
Easy peasy like a breeze-y.

458
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:05,874
I know I said
I'd wait, but...

459
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:07,342
You're going after Michael.

460
00:25:07,344 --> 00:25:09,878
I have to.
You can't.

461
00:25:11,015 --> 00:25:12,981
You don't think I can win.

462
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:14,983
I think we don't know
how strong Michael is.

463
00:25:14,985 --> 00:25:17,019
And he doesn't know
how strong <i>I</i> am.

464
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,624
I know you've been winning
all these fights,

465
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:27,129
and you want
to take him on so bad.

466
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:30,666
I was just like you,
with hunting.

467
00:25:30,668 --> 00:25:33,035
But I learned
the hard way --

468
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:34,970
thinking you can win
all the time,

469
00:25:34,972 --> 00:25:39,274
running in blind into
every fight?

470
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:41,477
That's how you make mistakes.

471
00:25:43,414 --> 00:25:46,582
And the people here, they --

472
00:25:46,584 --> 00:25:48,283
I'm doing this for them.

473
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:50,185
You can't help them
if you're dead.

474
00:25:51,856 --> 00:25:55,324
And I can't lose
another boy.

475
00:26:04,535 --> 00:26:07,369
You won't.

476
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:10,906
I'll come back,
for all of you.

477
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:16,011
I promise.

478
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:23,285
No.

479
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:27,122
Kevin?

480
00:26:27,124 --> 00:26:29,258
You can't go.

481
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:40,068
Michael...

482
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,104
he told me to wait --

483
00:26:42,106 --> 00:26:44,106
for Bobby,

484
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:46,875
for all of you to be
together -- but I can't.

485
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:50,412
He wanted you to see.

486
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:54,149
Whatever Michael said,
he was lying.

487
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:57,553
No! Michael says...

488
00:26:57,555 --> 00:26:59,688
that when I get to Heaven --

489
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,790
when he lets me into
Heaven --

490
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:04,426
I'll get to see my mom
again.

491
00:27:04,428 --> 00:27:07,095
I've been to Heaven,

492
00:27:07,097 --> 00:27:08,897
and what's there...

493
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:11,500
it's just memories.
Nothing's real.

494
00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:13,268
I don't care!

495
00:27:14,672 --> 00:27:17,139
You don't understand. I...

496
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:22,210
You don't know
the things that I've done.

497
00:27:26,684 --> 00:27:30,485
I just want this
to be over.

498
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:33,622
Your spell won't kill me.

499
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:37,292
Michael doesn't want
to kill you.

500
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,797
He wants to break you.

501
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,899
He said for me to
tell you that,

502
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:46,635
“Even if you win,

503
00:27:46,637 --> 00:27:48,103
you still lose.”

504
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:51,873
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,208
Don't!

506
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,143
I'm sorry!

507
00:28:55,677 --> 00:28:58,678
One last thing,
just so we're clear.

508
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,014
Take out the bodyguards,
take out the bystanders,

509
00:29:01,016 --> 00:29:02,415
whatever.

510
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:04,551
But when it comes
to Sleipnir and Loki,

511
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:07,020
<i>I'm</i> the one who delivers
the coup de grace.

512
00:29:07,022 --> 00:29:10,223
I want my beautiful face to be
the last thing that they see.

513
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:11,958
Okay, no, you know what?

514
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,593
No more plans, no more rules.

515
00:29:13,595 --> 00:29:15,428
You want Loki
dead on the ground?

516
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,230
That's what you're
gonna get.

517
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:24,037
Get him!

518
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:35,348
Uhh!
Aah!

519
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,817
Aah!

520
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,358
Please.

521
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,427
Dean?

522
00:29:49,564 --> 00:29:51,564
Mnh-mnh.

523
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:52,999
Uhh!

524
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:57,036
Dean!

525
00:29:58,273 --> 00:30:00,507
He left.
Ah.

526
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:02,542
Big bros, right?

527
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:05,044
<i>Always</i> think
they know best.

528
00:30:05,046 --> 00:30:06,980
The penthouse.

529
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:08,414
He went after Loki!

530
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:09,849
No.

531
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:12,552
No, Loki's mine!

532
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:37,677
Loki?

533
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,514
So <i>you</i> are Dean Winchester.

534
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:42,949
And you're the annoying god

535
00:30:42,951 --> 00:30:44,851
that we're wasting our time
tryin' to kill.

536
00:30:44,853 --> 00:30:49,122
Mm. And did Gabriel tell you
<i>why</i> he wants me dead?

537
00:30:49,124 --> 00:30:51,190
I don't care.

538
00:30:51,192 --> 00:30:53,726
Yes, you do.

539
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:56,563
Little bit.

540
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,965
Our treatment of your friend

541
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:03,036
is payback for a slight
of a more personal nature.

542
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:09,242
The death of my father,
Odin.

543
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:12,812
Oh, that wasn't him.
Lucifer did that.

544
00:31:12,814 --> 00:31:14,380
Ah.

545
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:18,418
But <i>why</i> was my father there
in the first place?

546
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,253
To parlay,

547
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:23,723
to deal with
Gabriel's brothers.

548
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:27,594
When we first made terms,
I had only one condition --

549
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:29,529
I would give him my face,

550
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:32,699
teach him to be me,
the trickster,

551
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:36,569
<i>if</i> he agreed to abandon

552
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:40,940
the more...volatile affairs
of his family.

553
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:43,009
Forever.

554
00:31:43,011 --> 00:31:47,080
When he hit that hotel,
he broke that promise,

555
00:31:47,082 --> 00:31:49,749
and it cost my father
his life.

556
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:51,551
The world was
coming to an end.

557
00:31:51,553 --> 00:31:54,053
That never mattered
to him before.

558
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,158
Gabriel had to be punished.

559
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:05,298
Odin was a salty,
disagreeable bastard.

560
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,033
Truth is...

561
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:08,968
he despised me.

562
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:13,873
But he was my father.

563
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:17,310
I'm sure you understand.

564
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,679
What would you do
for <i>your</i> father?

565
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:22,115
Hmm.

566
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:30,256
Hello, Gabriel.

567
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,272
Oh, so you can hit me,
but I can't hit you?

568
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,575
Mess with
the real Trickster...

569
00:32:50,812 --> 00:32:53,346
get the <i>real</i> tricks.

570
00:32:58,086 --> 00:33:00,286
No, no, no!

571
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:02,989
It's Loki magic.
He's a hologram.

572
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:06,225
All right, if we can't kill him,
we gotta kill the real Loki.

573
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:10,196
You don't have
<i>my</i> wooden sword?

574
00:33:13,668 --> 00:33:15,935
No.

575
00:33:15,937 --> 00:33:18,204
Wanted to do this one
old school.

576
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:20,306
Mm.

577
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:22,508
With your...

578
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,777
“archangel” powers?

579
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:29,182
This is for my father.

580
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:31,317
Ah!

581
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,653
You think you're some...

582
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:36,255
poor, innocent victim?

583
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:37,957
Gabriel,

584
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:42,829
with his deadbeat daddy
and his mean older brothers.

585
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:45,031
“Who will help me?”

586
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:48,201
“Who will save me?”

587
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,106
I did!

588
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:54,440
But you...

589
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:57,677
you couldn't keep
<i>one</i> promise.

590
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,013
And then
you had the audacity

591
00:34:01,015 --> 00:34:05,551
to ask <i>me</i>
to help <i>you</i> again?!

592
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:11,357
You think
<i>I</i> deserve to die

593
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,793
for <i>your</i> spinelessness?!

594
00:34:15,163 --> 00:34:17,897
That my sons
deserved to die?!

595
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:19,766
Aah!

596
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:25,905
Aah!

597
00:34:32,981 --> 00:34:37,617
Of course, <i>of course</i>

598
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,019
you would need someone
to swoop in

599
00:34:40,021 --> 00:34:42,588
and save your pitiful ass.

600
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,992
Shut up!
Face it, old friend,

601
00:34:45,994 --> 00:34:47,994
you're a joke.

602
00:34:47,996 --> 00:34:50,096
You're a failure.

603
00:34:50,098 --> 00:34:53,766
You live for pleasure.
You stand for nothing.

604
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:55,601
And in the end,

605
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:58,437
that's exactly what
you'll die for.

606
00:35:00,008 --> 00:35:01,908
You first.

607
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,533
Listen...

608
00:36:31,535 --> 00:36:35,236
I know you two weren't the, uh,
eagerest of beavers

609
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:37,005
when it came to
helping me out back there,

610
00:36:37,007 --> 00:36:39,474
so, uh...

611
00:36:39,476 --> 00:36:42,710
I-I just wanna say...thanks.

612
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:47,248
So...

613
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,485
this other world Michael...

614
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:52,787
how we doing this?

615
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:55,723
Wait, you're...
actually gonna help us?

616
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:58,126
Yeah, no tricks?

617
00:36:58,128 --> 00:37:00,095
A deal is a deal.

618
00:37:02,232 --> 00:37:06,401
And if I'm being
perfectly honest,

619
00:37:06,403 --> 00:37:08,036
tricks are for kids.

620
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:20,648
Hey...

621
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,052
How you feeling?
Now that...you...

622
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:26,421
Got my sweet,
sweet vengeance on?

623
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:28,857
Yeah, sure. I guess.

624
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:33,128
Swell, Sam.

625
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,263
I'm a whole new guy.

626
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:39,067
That's what I thought.

627
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,730
It's my fault.

628
00:38:08,732 --> 00:38:10,899
I said I'd protect them.

629
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:17,272
We can prepare
and we can fight...

630
00:38:19,276 --> 00:38:20,942
and sometimes,

631
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:23,144
things happen
we'll never see coming.

632
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:28,283
If I can't keep them safe,
then what's the point?

633
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:44,933
All right, so Cass is helping
Gabriel settle in.

634
00:38:44,935 --> 00:38:47,502
Rowena's boning up
on the demon tablet.

635
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:49,671
So... once Gabe's
grace levels are back up,

636
00:38:49,673 --> 00:38:52,173
we -- we should be
good to go.

637
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:53,775
Great.

638
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:55,443
Yeah.

639
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:59,847
Yeah.

640
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:02,750
Mmm.

641
00:39:02,752 --> 00:39:04,385
Hey...

642
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:09,090
back at the hotel...

643
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:12,694
why did you go after Loki
without us?

644
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:15,964
Saw an opening,
so I took it.

645
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:18,032
So you left us?

646
00:39:18,034 --> 00:39:20,401
You guys were handling
those goons just fine.

647
00:39:20,403 --> 00:39:22,570
I just figured I'd...

648
00:39:22,572 --> 00:39:24,005
multitask.

649
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:26,474
That's not...

650
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:30,645
I'm saying this has become
a whole thing with you lately.

651
00:39:30,647 --> 00:39:32,914
A whole thing?
Yeah.

652
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,749
Since when?

653
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:37,852
Since the last time
we opened up a rift.

654
00:39:37,854 --> 00:39:39,354
Since you decided
to sideline me

655
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:41,889
and then head to
Apocalypse World with Ketch.

656
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:45,393
Okay, well...
we talked about that.

657
00:39:45,395 --> 00:39:47,996
Did we?

658
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,564
Because I gotta be honest,

659
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:51,766
after everything,
you're treating me like

660
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:54,902
I-I deserve to be back at
the kid's table or something.

661
00:39:57,107 --> 00:39:59,707
Sam, I'm not gonna apologize
for protecting you.

662
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:03,278
So that's what you think
you're doing here?

663
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,516
You remember what happened

664
00:40:08,518 --> 00:40:10,518
the last time we had
front row tickets

665
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,222
to the Lucifer/Michael show?

666
00:40:14,224 --> 00:40:15,890
'Cause I do.

667
00:40:18,395 --> 00:40:19,694
You died...

668
00:40:21,564 --> 00:40:23,164
and went to Hell.

669
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:26,334
But see, this time,

670
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,369
the apocalypse isn't
looking for us.

671
00:40:28,371 --> 00:40:31,172
We're actually looking
for it.

672
00:40:31,174 --> 00:40:33,608
I don't care
what happens to me.

673
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,576
I never really have.

674
00:40:35,578 --> 00:40:38,379
But I do care about
what happens to my brother.

675
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:46,554
Dean, we're going to
that place,

676
00:40:46,556 --> 00:40:49,090
and we're gonna save
Jack and Mom.

677
00:40:49,092 --> 00:40:50,925
Together.

678
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:53,361
And if something happens,

679
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:56,764
we will deal with it
<i>together.</i>

680
00:41:05,308 --> 00:41:08,910
And if we die?

681
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:10,678
We'll do that together, too.
