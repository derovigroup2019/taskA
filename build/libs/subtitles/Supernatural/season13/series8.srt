185
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,931
Smash can crack any safe
built by man.

186
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:13,235
And Grab's a demon, expert in
bypassing supernatural security.

You might call him a hoarder.

somewhere on Shrike's farm.

200
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:48,270

Farm's warded inside and out.

204
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:56,712
Grab can locate
the vault room,

205

but the only thing
that can actually open it

206
00:10:58,516 --> 00:11:00,749
is the blood of a man
who's been to Hell and back.

Then you can give us
the rest of the spell.

213
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:21,103
I'm afraid it needs to be
straight from the tap.

214

And I don't just need
your blood. I need you.

215

to Shrike,

there's what I know
and what I don't know.

217
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,947

He uses his own blood.

224
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:52,000
So he's been to Hell.
What's he, a demon?

225
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,703
Luther gets around,
but he is human.

226
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:56,972
Not one of the good ones.
He's a sadist,

the spell to Asmodeus.

You gonna be okay?

723
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:33,467
Yeah. I'm gonna be good.

724
00:39:33,469 --> 00:39:38,272
Hey, I just wanted to say...
I'm sorry.

725
00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:41,809
What you did for me...

726
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:44,145
you didn't have to do that.

727
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:47,481
Thank you, seriously.

728
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:50,318
See ya around.

00:39:52,288 --> 00:39:53,688
Hey, Alice.

730
00:39:55,158 --> 00:39:57,191
Stay weird.

731
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:00,528

Yeah, not really.

00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:18,846
Not exactly the best day,
you know?

736
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:20,781
Well, it's not the worst.

737
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:25,419
We did save somebody.
That felt good.

740
00:40:33,596 --> 00:40:35,796
We'll figure
something else out.

741
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:37,665
And if that doesn't work,
then we'll move on to next,

742

and then
whatever's after that.

743
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,138
We just keep working,

It feels really good to hear you
talk like that again.
