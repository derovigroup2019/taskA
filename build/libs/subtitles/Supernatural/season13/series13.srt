1
00:00:01,426 --> 00:00:04,061
Michael is
a monster? Pure evil?

2
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:06,067
That paradise you left behind?

3
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:07,702
I believe I'll take up
residence.

4
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:11,238
Sort of need that
pesky little rift.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,574
I've assembled all the elements
annotated in the angel tablets.

6
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:16,377
The key ingredient --
archangel grace.

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,845
This better work.

8
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:24,185
?

9
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:25,586
Ouch.

10
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:28,923
Asmodeus was
my weakest creation.

11
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:33,027
Doesn't seem that weak
to me.

12
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:34,528
That whole shape-shifty
thing he does?

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,796
I-I didn't give him that.

14
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:37,331
Cass? What's happening?

15
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,899
I'll fill
you in when I know more.

16
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,802
Someone got mad
and broke his warding.

17
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:43,637
Good times.

18
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:49,110
Jack is gone. Mom is
trapped in another reality.

19
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:50,511
We'll figure it out.

20
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:53,247
Dean, we don't have a plan.
So, how?

21
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:56,017
I don't know, but we will.

22
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:58,986
This would be <i>so</i> much easier

23
00:00:58,988 --> 00:01:00,421
if somebody would be a pal

24
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:01,956
and let me eat a little
of his grace.

25
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,525
Oh, come on, Castiel.
We just fought side by side.

26
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:06,694
You gotta trust me now, man.

27
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:15,569
?

28
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:17,238
<i>Aah!</i>

29
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:30,151
?

30
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:41,362
Told you I found a body.

31
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:45,466
See? Dead.

32
00:01:52,942 --> 00:02:03,184
?

33
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:13,060
?

34
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:15,496
Lucifer!

35
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:20,067
?

36
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,869
Where are you?

37
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:30,878
?

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,483
?

39
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:37,518
- Oops!
- Whoa!

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,422
?

41
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:43,190
Oh! Ah! Oh!

42
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:44,725
Whoa!

43
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:47,695
?

44
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:50,831
Oh!

45
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:56,370
?

46
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:57,838
I think
I just fell for you.

47
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,307
?

48
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:02,009
I'll catch you any time
you fall.

49
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:07,948
?

50
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,784
Thanks.

51
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:13,087
Nice job.

52
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:16,423
Another happy beginning.

53
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:19,627
Right...

54
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:22,263
Cupid?

55
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:26,265

58
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:44,451
That's very good.

59
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:45,986
But I need seconds.

60
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:48,155
Where can I find more angels?
I-I-I...

61
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:51,392
Where do I find more angels?

62
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:52,926
I don't know.

63
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,562
There -- there -- there
aren't m-many of us left.

64
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:57,631
Don't lie to me.

65
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,366
I'm not.

66
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:01,268
Please. Please.

67
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,836
Please.
Oh, no.

68
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:05,706
Okay. Okay, Cupid.

69
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,375
Don't cry.

70
00:04:08,377 --> 00:04:10,911
You know, without your grace,
you're only human,

71
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:14,715
so you should be careful.

72
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:16,950
Accidents can happen.

73
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:18,886
?

74
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:28,162
Like that.

75
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:30,431
Sorry.

76
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,133
Let me get this straight.

77
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:36,770
You were kidnapped weeks ago,
locked up.

78
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:38,305
Cass, I just talked to you
on the phone.

79
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:40,841
No. No.

80
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:44,111
Asmodeus had my phone.
You've been talking to him.

81
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:45,512
What did he want with you?

82
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:48,015
Well, they mostly wanted
Lucifer. I just, uh...

83
00:04:48,017 --> 00:04:50,050
I just happened to be
in proximity.

84
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:51,819
Lucifer? No, no, no, he --
No, no, no.

85
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,587
We slammed his ass back in
the Apocalypse World. How did --

86
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:55,255
Kevin Tran.
Kevin Tran?

87
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:57,191
The Apocalypse World
version, yes.

88
00:04:57,193 --> 00:05:00,260
He managed to open a rift
using Lucifer's grace.

89
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:01,728
They have an angel tablet?

90
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,230
Yes.

91
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:04,698
And the Archangel Michael --

92
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,467
again, Apocalypse World
version --

93
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:09,703
he wants to use the spell
to invade and conquer our world.

94
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:14,808
That's why I met with Lucifer.

95
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:19,012
So you met w--

96
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:22,249
Cass, I specifically told you
not to do anything stupid.

97
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:23,851
Well, he was weak,

98
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:26,687
and given the context of
our imminent annihilation,

99
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:29,089
it didn't seem stupid.

100
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,992
Lucifer wanted to help
fight Michael.

101
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:34,895
Oh, yeah. Right.
Lucifer wanted to help. Sure.

102
00:05:34,897 --> 00:05:37,431
If he were lying,
I'd have known it.

103
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:40,634
He was...he was scared.

104
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:45,506
But Asmodeus showed up before we
could finish our conversation.

105
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:47,207
And when we finally
managed to escape,

106
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:50,143
Lucifer did try to kill me.

107
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:52,212
Well, so much for helping.

108
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,150
He say anything about our mom?

109
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:59,286
She's alive.

110
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,457
That's all I know. I'm sorry.

111
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:08,795
?

112
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:21,074
Nothing but humans.

113
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:24,778
Not a wing flapper in sight.

114
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,615
What? What are ya gawking at?
You never seen

115
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:30,317
the Prince of Darkness
before, pal?

116
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,086
Turn around. Come on, man.

117
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:55,475
What?

118
00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:57,177
I hungry?

119
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:01,181
Ew.

120
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:05,485
Seriously?

121
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:08,422
Spare some change, man?

122
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:10,357
Bless you.

123
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:16,663
?

124
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:18,699
It was a simple task.

125
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:21,268
All these fools had to do
was keep Lucifer on ice

126
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,104
until I returned
from an important errand.

127
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:27,040
Frankly,
I'm shocked you left.

128
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:32,746
I believe I said it was
an <i>important</i> errand.

129
00:07:37,386 --> 00:07:42,022
My initial thought was
to take Lucifer prisoner.

130
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:44,224
That's proven to be, uh...

131
00:07:44,226 --> 00:07:46,026
Monumentally stupid?

132
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:55,102
?

133
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:57,971
?

134
00:07:57,973 --> 00:07:59,706
Indeed.

135
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,043
So, take two.

136
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,680
I want you to kill him.

137
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:09,716
Kill...the Devil?

138
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:11,885
Oh, he's runnin' on empty.

139
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:14,788
Nice angel blade to the heart,
he'll go down.

140
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:19,526
Probably.

141
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:23,130
Do it fast, though,
before he fills the tank.

142
00:08:23,132 --> 00:08:25,999
And if he does?

143
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:28,335
Oh.

144
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:31,405
Oh, then I believe
we're all dead.

145
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:34,408
?

146
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,009
Give me some money.

147
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:39,212
Come on, man.

148
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:41,782
Here you go.
Thank you, sir.

149
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:43,250
Gag me.

150
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:45,886
Money. Or your jacket.

151
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:51,758
- Money, please.
- Here you go. - Bless you.

152
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,127
Come on!

153
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,396
What's the matter with you?

154
00:08:56,398 --> 00:09:01,134
Hey. Just so you know,
it's your vibe.

155
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:02,536
Oh, it's my vibe?

156
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:04,337
It's off-putting.
People don't...

157
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,606
people don't take to you.

158
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:08,508
Yeah, well, maybe because
this isn't <i>me,</i> all right?

159
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,845
I don't --
I don't <i>need</i> money.

160
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:13,847
Or food or warmth
or dental floss

161
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:16,149
or any of that crap.

162
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,922
Being human sucks.

163
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:25,959
Yeah, but...
what's the alternative?

164
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:28,128
Don't even
get me started, pal.

165
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,896
Can I have that, please?

166
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:37,404
Well...
closing time.

167
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:41,475
Yeah.

168
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:43,143
You hungry?

169
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:51,818
Hey, hey, hey. Aren't we going
inside the restaurant there

170
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,253
to -- to eat
a little dinner or...

171
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:55,689
We are.
Almost there. Come on.

172
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:02,329
Ugh.

173
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:05,132
Come on.
Corelli's lasagna? Kills.

174
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:06,933
Frankly, it's better
the next day.

175
00:10:06,935 --> 00:10:08,835
Okay, yeah,
why don't we, uh,

176
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:10,837
why don't we take that big pile
of cash you got there,

177
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,239
go inside the restaurant,

178
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:13,974
and get a dinner
that's botulism-lite?

179
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:18,445
Oh, no. That money's going
right into the old leg fund.

180
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:20,046
The “old leg fund”?

181
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:24,951
Okay, I got news for you.
Your leg is shot.

182
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:26,920
No doctor's gonna help you
with that,

183
00:10:26,922 --> 00:10:27,469
so we might as well just --

184
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,090
I'm not blowing my money
on doctors.

185
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:32,392
I'm gonna see Sister Jo.
“Sister Jo”?

186
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:34,761
She don't come cheap,
but she can heal anything.

187
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:36,596
- She's a faith healer.
- Yeah.

188
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:39,366
Okay, let you down easy?

189
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:42,435
She's a fake.
They're all fake, man.

190
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:44,337
No. I've seen it.

191
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,542
Boils, blindness,
birth defects.

192
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:52,846
She touches you,
there's this glow,

193
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:54,881
and you're cured.

194
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:57,050
Really?

195
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:58,585
Yeah.

196
00:10:58,587 --> 00:11:00,387
Mmm.

197
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:03,190
?

198
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,997
It's a long shot at best.

199
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,365
Yeah, well,

200
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:14,933
most of what we do
are long shots.

201
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:18,270
You get used to it.

202
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:20,005
Cass, I'm sorry.

203
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:22,240
All that time you were
with Asmodeus, I-I...

204
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:23,842
We should've known
it wasn't you.

205
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:26,011
Well, he's a shape-shifter.

206
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:28,413
Besides, I-I was the one
who got myself captured.

207
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:31,249
Yeah, but if Sam and I knew,
you know, we would've...

208
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:34,452
Yeah, I know. I know.
You would've tried another long shot.

209
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:36,087
I'm fine, Dean.

210
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:38,089
You sure about that?

211
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:39,958
Right now, all that matters

212
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,862
is getting Jack and your mother
out of that place.

213
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:45,664
Okay?

214
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,834
Look, I promised Kelly
that I would protect her son.

215
00:11:49,836 --> 00:11:52,404
I intend to keep
that promise.

216
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:57,275
Hey, there he is!

217
00:11:57,277 --> 00:11:58,810
Donny, how you doing?

218
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:00,945
Ugh, the usual.

219
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:02,380
Bewildered.

220
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:05,617
Right. Cool.
So here's the plan.

221
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:07,352
We nab Lucifer.

222
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:09,254
If he is as weak
as Cass says,

223
00:12:09,256 --> 00:12:12,157
then the angel cuffs
should work on him.

224
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,259
Yeah. Maybe.

225
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:15,660
Well, maybe's all we got.

226
00:12:15,662 --> 00:12:18,596
So...we grab Satan,

227
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:21,766
and we use his grace to open up
a door between two universes.

228
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:24,636
Okay? Then we get Mom,
we get Jack, and we get out.

229
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:26,638
Slam the door before
Michael follows us

230
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,006
and destroys our universe.

231
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:30,408
Now it's gonna be harder
than it sounds.

232
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,746
And so, the spell to open this
rift is in the angel tablet?

233
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:36,381
Yeah, they --
they are, um...

234
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:39,551
on Earth 2, except --

235
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:41,720
Except we don't have
the angel tablet anymore.

236
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:44,522
No, we don't. We do have...

237
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,226
the demon tablet.

238
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:55,533
?

239
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,202
We thought it might
mention the spell as well

240
00:12:57,204 --> 00:12:58,603
because it, too,
is the word of God.

241
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:00,372
And since you speak God,

242
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:02,507
figured it was
right up your alley.

243
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:04,342
So give it a swing.

244
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,910
These glyphs,

245
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:08,146
they're -- they're --
they're nearly impenetrable.

246
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:11,883
Okay. Um...

247
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:14,052
Well, is there anything
we can get you? Or, um...

248
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:16,154
Chicken wings.
Excuse me?

249
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:17,655
Chicken wings.

250
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:20,592
Heavy lifting like this
requires real brain fuel.

251
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:23,728
My analysis of the half-lives
of the 33 arsenic isotopes

252
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,897
required about, mm...

253
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:27,899
25 buckets.

254
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:32,704
Cass?

255
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:36,908
You all right?
It's angel radio.

256
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,011
A vessel was found
last night, mutilated.

257
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:45,183
Wait. Who's killing angels?

258
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,340
Oh.

259
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:11,142
- Ahh!
- Oh!

260
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:13,912
Thank you.

261
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:27,892
<i>?</i>

262
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:30,628
<i>?</i>

263
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,063
Don't be afraid.

264
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:34,432
<i>?</i>

265
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:48,613
?

266
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:50,748
You're whole again.

267
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:56,454
Thank you.

268
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:57,922
Thank you.

269
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:07,899
?

270
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:09,868
Okay, so according
to the report,

271
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,736
the Vic died from trauma.

272
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:15,974
Uh, something blunt
driven through the body.

273
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:19,010
There was also a slit
in his neck, which means --

274
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:21,846
Lucifer fed on
this angel's grace,

275
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:24,849
which means he's trying
to restore his power.

276
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:27,886
And if he does --
We're boned.

277
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:30,388
Epically.

278
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:42,467
We're closed.

279
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:44,369
Come back tomorrow.

280
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:47,672
Oh, but I need healin',
Sister Jo.

281
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:51,809
Or should I say Anael.

282
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:54,479
?

283
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:57,248
You're an angel.

284
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,317
Back atcha...

285
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:01,753
Lucifer.

286
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:05,557
What? No, “Eek!”?

287
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:08,626
No “Spare me, Dark Master”"

288
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:11,763
No quaking fear?
Should I quake?

289
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:14,532
I mean, yeah, most people
sort of do. Yeah.

290
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:16,134
I'm not most.

291
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:18,136
<i>Right.</i>

292
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:22,407
You're special because you
heal people for <i>money.</i>

293
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:23,808
Hmm.

294
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,243
Not very heavenly,
I have to say.

295
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:27,312
We're not in Heaven.
We're on Earth.

296
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:29,881
You may have noticed,
around here,

297
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:33,084
good life ain't cheap.

298
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:35,386
After The Fall,

299
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:37,288
all the angels were a mess,

300
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,890
desperate for “housing.”

301
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:40,858
Any vessel would do.

302
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,760
And they had no long game.

303
00:16:42,762 --> 00:16:44,195
Yeah, that's...

304
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:47,131
I, on the other hand,
took some care.

305
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,533
I listened.

306
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,935
A woman was praying for
her dying husband.

307
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:56,207
So we made a trade --
his life for her vessel.

308
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:58,610
She was grateful.

309
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:03,047
I realized humans are
so desperate for life,

310
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:06,751
they'd do almost anything,
pay almost anything.

311
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:09,220
So...ca-ching!

312
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:12,156
I was a so-so angel,
but turns out,

313
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:15,893
I am
an excellent businesswoman.

314
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:17,895
Wow.

315
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:19,597
That is very impressive.

316
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,332
?

317
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:24,402
As you can see, my high-octane
grace is a little bit low.

318
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:26,904
So I came for a recharge,
which unfortunately,

319
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:28,373
doesn't end well for you.

320
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,609
Not very cost efficient,

321
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:33,277
running around,
killing angels.

322
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,580
What?
Wouldn't it make more sense

323
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:39,984
to keep one premium angel
on tap?

324
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:43,187
Take a sip now, sip later.

325
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:45,189
Not taking all the grace,

326
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:47,825
but giving the angel
time to recharge.

327
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:51,329
Then rinse and repeat.

328
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,131
And that angel being...

329
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:56,200
?

330
00:17:56,202 --> 00:17:58,136
You'd do that?

331
00:17:58,138 --> 00:17:59,537
It's better than having you

332
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:00,972
suck me dry and kill me,
isn't it?

333
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:05,176
This way, I help you,
you help me.

334
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,713
Still a businesswoman.

335
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,617
Oh, well,
if you see this man...

336
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:14,152
Yeah.

337
00:18:14,154 --> 00:18:16,821
Thanks.

338
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:18,256
Excuse me, sir.

339
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:20,224
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

340
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:22,326
Yeah, no, I'm kind of
working here, man.

341
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:24,495
I tell you what.
I'll be quick. I promise.

342
00:18:24,497 --> 00:18:25,930
Just tell me...

343
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:29,300
have you ever seen
this man?

344
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:32,503
Actually,
we had a lovely chat.

345
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:35,073
He was curious about
this faith healer I'm saving up to see.

346
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:37,642
She's gonna fix this leg
right up.

347
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:39,410
Sister Jo?

348
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:42,413
And did he, uh...
believe in her?

349
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:44,849
Not at first, but after
I described her skills,

350
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:46,651
he was very supportive.

351
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:48,619
?

352
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:58,963
?

353
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:08,873
Ooh.

354
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:14,145
Better?

355
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:17,215
So much better.

356
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:18,816
Wow.

357
00:19:18,818 --> 00:19:22,353
That was so much more fun
than my last time.

358
00:19:22,355 --> 00:19:24,889
I had to kill that guy.

359
00:19:24,891 --> 00:19:26,524
When was that?

360
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:28,693
Two nights ago.

361
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:30,762
That was <i>you?</i>

362
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:32,630
That was all over
angel radio.

363
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:34,098
Yeah.

364
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,000
Star power. Can't fight it.

365
00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:38,202
Did anyone know
you were coming here?

366
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:45,443
?

367
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:57,121
?

368
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:02,293
?

369
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:11,536
It's only you.

370
00:20:11,538 --> 00:20:12,970
?

371
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,498
What the hell
are you doing here?

372
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:21,402
Do we really have
to do all this again?

373
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,738
Last time we were together,
I saved your lives,

374
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,873
and you shot me.

375
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,875
Doesn't that make us even?

376
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:29,344
No, I guess not.

377
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:31,512
Dean asked you a question.
What are you doing here?

378
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:33,581
My sources tell me
Lucifer's back.

379
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,750
He's weak and he's --
or was --

380
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:39,921
in this wonderful
little slice of Americana.

381
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:44,225
I was going to try and kill him,
as were you, I assume.

382
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:46,394
Great.

383
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:48,496
Who are you working for?

384
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,331
Isn't it possible that
I'm simply trying

385
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,800
to strike a blow for the good
of humanity?

386
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:55,403
- Hmm.
- No.

387
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:58,072
That's not possible.

388
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:02,510
And truth be told,
taking out Lucifer

389
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,879
would be an enormous
feather in the cap.

390
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:07,515
My business model is
very, um...

391
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,183
word of mouth.

392
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:14,289
All right, so if Lucifer
isn't here, where is he?

393
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,791
Ah, excellent question.

394
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:20,662
I propose we team up.

395
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:23,998
Share Intel,
cover more ground.

396
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,300
Hmm?

397
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:27,802
Huzzah!

398
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:37,478
?

399
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,013
All right.

400
00:21:39,015 --> 00:21:41,282
I say we take dick bag here
back to the bunker,

401
00:21:41,284 --> 00:21:43,017
find out what he knows,
and put a bullet in him,

402
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:45,520
burn his bones,
and flush his ashes.

403
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:46,988
I like that plan.

404
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,724
Hey. Check this out.

405
00:21:51,428 --> 00:21:54,429
<i>That's</i> Sister Jo?
The faith healer?

406
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:57,565
?

407
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,534
No, that's not.

408
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:02,236
She's an angel.
Her name is Anael.

409
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,476
All right, so say Lucifer
drained her and killed her.

410
00:22:08,478 --> 00:22:10,211
Where's her body?

411
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:29,130
No way.
What you got?

412
00:22:29,132 --> 00:22:31,499
So I set an alert up
on my phone.

413
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:34,802
Looks like Sister Jo has just
used her credit card.

414
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:36,204
Where?

415
00:22:36,206 --> 00:22:43,845
?

416
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:56,190
?

417
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:57,992
You don't have to rush.

418
00:22:57,994 --> 00:23:03,030
?

419
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:06,567
We can do this slowly.

420
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:19,781
?

421
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:29,690
?

422
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:35,463
?

423
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,406
?

424
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,911
It's always so strange.

425
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,449
That final moment...

426
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:56,751
when I've lost just enough
grace that I'm almost --

427
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:58,419
Human?

428
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,756
I feel...

429
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:04,992
emotions.

430
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:07,228
Sensations.

431
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,165
Things they must feel.

432
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:15,670
Yeah, I had that experience.

433
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:18,072
I didn't like it.

434
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:22,009
Hunger. Cold. Loneliness.

435
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:26,514
I don't know
how they keep going.

436
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:27,982
I do.

437
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:29,951
When I'm in that place,

438
00:24:29,953 --> 00:24:33,454
I can see
how there'd be pain.

439
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:36,491
But there's also hope.

440
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:39,227
Love, even.

441
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:42,196
Angels can only imagine.

442
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
Sometimes I envy humans.

443
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,335
They can be anything.

444
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:49,837
Do you know what my job was?

445
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,839
Upstairs?

446
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:53,508
I pushed a button.

447
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,444
A soul would come in,
I'd push a button,

448
00:24:56,446 --> 00:24:59,881
they'd be counted,
and I'd wait for the next.

449
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:02,250
It was <i>so</i> --
Boring?

450
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,885
Eternal.
Mm.

451
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:06,320
I mean, I had ideas.

452
00:25:06,322 --> 00:25:10,658
I saw how Heaven was running,
and I knew how to fix it.

453
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,126
But no one would listen
to me.

454
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:15,329
Not Michael, not Raphael,
not Naomi.

455
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:18,966
They would just send me back
to push my button.

456
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,035
So up there, you're nobody.

457
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:24,672
Down here, you're somebody.

458
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,910
After The Fall,

459
00:25:28,912 --> 00:25:31,579
when we lost our wings,

460
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:34,682
I wasn't devastated.

461
00:25:34,684 --> 00:25:39,620
I was liberated.
I was finally free.

462
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,591
But you must know
how that feels.

463
00:25:43,593 --> 00:25:46,193
No.

464
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:50,131
No, I always wanted
to...fit in,

465
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,799
please a father
I couldn't please.

466
00:25:54,037 --> 00:25:57,305
And now I'm gonna be a father.

467
00:25:57,307 --> 00:26:00,741
Probably screw it up
like he did.

468
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:05,379
Lucifer...

469
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:08,182
the great and terrible.

470
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:16,123
?

471
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:19,393
I don't know why I said that.

472
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:21,729
Stupid.

473
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:25,032
I mean, it's like...

474
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:26,867
pretty soon, I'm not gonna
feel anything, you know.

475
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:28,469
I mean...

476
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:30,571
the more I do this,
the stronger I get,

477
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:32,239
the more <i>me</i> I become.

478
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:34,408
Lucifer...

479
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,179
Prince of Darkness.
King of Lies.

480
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:41,649
I'm back, baby.

481
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:43,317
Then what?

482
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,419
And then?

483
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:48,723
I'm gonna find my son,

484
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:51,258
and the fun really starts.

485
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:57,431
?

486
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:03,571
This better be good news.

487
00:27:03,573 --> 00:27:05,006
It is, my lord.

488
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:06,707
The prophet, we found him.

489
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,210
?

490
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,853
Hey, it's you.

491
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:21,889
That -- I-I thought
I felt a presence.

492
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,758
I sensed you as well.

493
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,259
Ah.

494
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:27,328
Sam and Dean are --
are still tracking Lucifer,

495
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,296
but they asked me to
check in on you.

496
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:32,099
Oh, well, uh, I'm making
progress with the demon tablet,

497
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:36,504
but... oh,
my goodness, it's a challenge.

498
00:27:36,506 --> 00:27:38,105
Really?

499
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:41,809
Yeah. I have determined, though,
that there is definitely

500
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:46,147
some kind of spell for, uh...
you know...

501
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:48,382
opening
a door to that other world.

502
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:50,384
Well, that would be
very useful.

503
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:51,786
Yes.

504
00:27:51,788 --> 00:27:53,554
The ingredients are
very, very complicated.

505
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:56,791
I-I'm just starting to, uh,
decipher them.

506
00:27:56,793 --> 00:27:59,360
Well, let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

507
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:01,696
I doubt it, since apparently,
I'm the only one on the planet

508
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:03,030
who can read the damn thing.

509
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,266
I just hope I'm in time.

510
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,068
You mean,
before Michael comes?

511
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,870
Before anything happens
to Jack or the boys' mom.

512
00:28:09,872 --> 00:28:11,405
I couldn't live with myself

513
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:13,541
if they never make it out
of that terrible place.

514
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:18,179
Yes, yes,
that would be very tragic.

515
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:20,147
Forget this.

516
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:24,151
Whatever you find
on that tablet,

517
00:28:24,153 --> 00:28:28,055
you will report to <i>me.</i>

518
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:29,557
Understand?

519
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:33,728
Yes.

520
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,665
Good boy.

521
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:39,633
Run along now.

522
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:45,005
?

523
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:46,674
Mnh.

524
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:59,439
This is it?

525
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:04,577
Yep. Last place Jo, or someone,
used her credit card.

526
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:06,012
Checked in last night.

527
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:07,647
Do you think Lucifer
is with her?

528
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:10,316
Or she's dead.
One way to find out.

529
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:18,524
?

530
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:20,059
Would you look at the...

531
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:21,994
Wrong. That's wrong.

532
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:24,864
Does anybody fact-check
this stuff?

533
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:26,933
I mean, that's...

534
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:29,368
?

535
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:34,841
This...

536
00:29:34,843 --> 00:29:36,576
Hello?

537
00:29:36,578 --> 00:29:37,910
My card?

538
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:40,947
<i>Of course it's good.</i>

539
00:29:40,949 --> 00:29:42,949
Yeah, okay.
Uh, you know what?

540
00:29:42,951 --> 00:29:44,550
Our system must be screwy.

541
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:46,519
Do you mind bringing the card
back so I can run it again?

542
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:48,054
<i>Okay. Just a minute.</i>

543
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:50,857
Sure. I'll be here.
That's great. Thank you.

544
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:54,427
Well, good news.
She's alive.

545
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:01,734
Anael.

546
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:04,504
Castiel.
What are you doing here?

547
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:06,038
We were gonna ask you
the same thing.

548
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,740
We're looking for Lucifer.
Have you seen him?

549
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:09,842
Do you know where he is?

550
00:30:09,844 --> 00:30:12,411
Yes. He's in the room.

551
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:13,746
Has he hurt you?

552
00:30:13,748 --> 00:30:16,749
Not yet. He's threatened.

553
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:18,618
He wants to drain my grace.

554
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,087
So he's still weak.
Very.

555
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:22,889
You have to help me.

556
00:30:22,891 --> 00:30:24,757
We will.

557
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,993
But first, you're gonna
help us.

558
00:30:28,363 --> 00:30:31,330
Dad's always stealing
my best lines, man.

559
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:33,599
Sh...

560
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:37,270
Lord Lucifer?
Could you let me in?

561
00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:39,939
Sorry. I forgot my key.

562
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:42,308
“Lord Lucifer”?

563
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,843
I likey.

564
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:49,415
Really, uh...

565
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,883
Mornin', Sunshine.

566
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:52,418
What's up?

567
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,986
Gents.

568
00:30:53,988 --> 00:30:56,722
Hey.

569
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:59,125
Uh...

570
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:01,160
Oh. Cass!

571
00:31:01,162 --> 00:31:04,397
You're alive. That's...

572
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,998
that's awesome.
They made me.

573
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,635
They forced me to tell them
how <i>weak</i> you still are.

574
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,973
Well, great seeing ya.
It's been a long time.

575
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:16,108
Uh, nice jacket there, Dean.

576
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,010
Your hair, Sam, is magnificent.

577
00:31:18,012 --> 00:31:21,113
Is that a leave-in conditioner
you have there?

578
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:24,784
?

579
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:27,954
We got this. Go.

580
00:31:27,956 --> 00:31:31,257
So what are you gonna do now?
You gonna -- you gonna kill me?

581
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:33,125
Mm.

582
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:35,127
Eventually.

583
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:41,133
?

584
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:43,302
Aah! Uhh!

585
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:47,073
Uhh!

586
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:48,774
?

587
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,309
We need to go.
Okay, just --

588
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:52,345
I just wanna enjoy this
for just a minute.

589
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:59,252
?

590
00:32:02,056 --> 00:32:04,357
That's good.
That's really good.

591
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:08,661
?

592
00:32:11,032 --> 00:32:13,633
?

593
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:19,905
Ohh. I've got to get
in better shape.

594
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:22,508
This is ridiculous.

595
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,510
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Did you just --

596
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:28,180
No. They vanished before
it went off.

597
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:30,916
But you're welcome.

598
00:32:33,488 --> 00:32:36,322
All right, so why did ya,
you know...

599
00:32:36,324 --> 00:32:40,192
Like I said,
I help you, you help me.

600
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,528
Right.

601
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,397
Cool.

602
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,966
Okay. So where on earth
do we go now?

603
00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:55,141
?

604
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:57,777
Congratulations, you just
helped Lucifer escape.

605
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:01,347
Put another way,
I opted out of my own escape

606
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:04,550
and put myself in harm's way
to save your lives...

607
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:06,319
again.

608
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:08,587
All right, all right. How did
you get out of the trunk?

609
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:10,156
I'm Ketch.

610
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:12,692
I found the demon bomb
in your weapons cache

611
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:15,761
and I thought, with Lucifer's
weakened state,

612
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:17,163
it might make a dent.

613
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:19,632
Well, it seems
his “weakened stat”"

614
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:21,701
may have been
greatly exaggerated.

615
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:24,704
Yeah, exactly. And -- and Jo,
w-what's the deal with her?

616
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:26,172
I don't know. In Heaven,
she was nothing.

617
00:33:26,174 --> 00:33:28,341
She was
a low-level functionary.

618
00:33:28,343 --> 00:33:30,910
Yeah, well, now she's
Satan's gal pal. That's awesome.

619
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:34,113
Gentlemen, this may, once again,
fall on deaf ears,

620
00:33:34,115 --> 00:33:35,881
but I shall have another go.

621
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,951
Clearly, Lucifer's more
dangerous than we thought.

622
00:33:38,953 --> 00:33:41,320
I propose we pool resources

623
00:33:41,322 --> 00:33:44,190
and go after him together.

624
00:33:45,393 --> 00:33:48,127
Dude, why would we <i>ever</i>
trust you?

625
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:49,962
Fine.

626
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:52,932
As proof of my sincerity,
I shall come clean.

627
00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:55,534
I'm working for Asmodeus.

628
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:57,036
?

629
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,772
Happy?
Whoa. <i>What?</i>

630
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,440
How is that supposed
to make us feel better?

631
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:04,076
It's not. It's supposed to
present an opportunity.

632
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:05,711
If I'm working for him,

633
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:08,114
then I can pass information
on to you.

634
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:10,383
?

635
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:13,552
Oh, right. And you would
do that for us?

636
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:15,054
For everyone.

637
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,358
I know you think
I'm a monster --

638
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,095
Because you are.

639
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:26,165
But even I must
draw the line somewhere.

640
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:28,734
And letting Lucifer free
upon the Earth?

641
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,537
Well, as it turns out,
that's my line.

642
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:37,143
Not to mention
the whole Michael situation.

643
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:40,279
I know you want to kill me.

644
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:41,914
I know you can't forgive me.

645
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:45,951
But if you think about it,
I'm the lesser of...

646
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:48,654
Well, at least three evils.

647
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:53,826
?

648
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:57,463
All I ask
is that you wait to murder me

649
00:34:57,465 --> 00:35:00,032
until after I prove useful.

650
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,567
Hmm?

651
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:06,238
I know we've had
our problems in the past,

652
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,340
little family squabbles.

653
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:10,209
Just minor,
little disagreements.

654
00:35:10,211 --> 00:35:13,179
You know, kids being kids
kinda stuff.

655
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:16,348
But right now, you need me.

656
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,150
Kill him.
Whoa, wait, hey!

657
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:20,186
Hold on, hold on,
hold on. Okay.

658
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:22,354
Number one, it's true.
I am powered down.

659
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:23,823
But you can't kill me.

660
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:25,925
We could try. Repeatedly.

661
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:29,261
Okay, look, number --
number two,

662
00:35:29,263 --> 00:35:33,432
I happen to know Heaven
is in short supply of angels.

663
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:34,800
All right, let's face it.

664
00:35:34,802 --> 00:35:36,902
After Pop took a powder,
your only strength,

665
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:40,005
your only defense
was in numbers, yeah?

666
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:43,876
And now, with the Prince of Hell
basically running...

667
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:48,614
Hell, if the dark side makes
a move, y'all are screwed.

668
00:35:48,616 --> 00:35:52,718
You...need...more...you.

669
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:56,522
But with Dad gone
and...everything,

670
00:35:56,524 --> 00:35:59,725
I mean, who's still up for
birthin' angels?

671
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:05,564
Yo! Yo!

672
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:08,133
- You can't.
- Yeah. - He can, Dumah.

673
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:11,670
Who are you to speak to me?

674
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:14,373
Okay, she's with me,
and you're gonna listen to her.

675
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,209
Hey, look, I was here when
you, when <i>all</i> of you were born.

676
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:19,311
I saw how the old man did it.

677
00:36:19,313 --> 00:36:22,147
I can make angels. Okay?

678
00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:24,783
And I'll do it, if...

679
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:26,619
Enough games, Lucifer.

680
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:31,223
<i>if</i> for my incredible act
of generosity,

681
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:34,326
you name me
the undisputed and unquestioned

682
00:36:34,328 --> 00:36:37,763
ruler of Heaven.

683
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:44,236
Yeah? It's funny.

684
00:36:44,238 --> 00:36:47,573
Oh, come on. Let's face it.
You don't wanna run the place.

685
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:50,175
Angels were designed to follow,
not lead.

686
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:53,312
Don't give me the stink eye.
That wasn't my idea.

687
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:57,116
The point is, you <i>need</i> me.

688
00:36:57,118 --> 00:36:59,585
And icing on the cake, guys --

689
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:02,288
how'd you like your wings back?

690
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:08,928
?

691
00:37:16,936 --> 00:37:19,537
So Ketch --
can we trust him?

692
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:21,172
Not even a little.

693
00:37:21,174 --> 00:37:24,075
Yeah,
of course not, but...

694
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:26,043
we need him, for now.

695
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:27,545
Right.

696
00:37:27,547 --> 00:37:28,913
And when we don't?

697
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:32,316
Guess.

698
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:41,358
Donatello,
you're doing great.

699
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,828
I mean, looks like you
made a lot of progress.

700
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,664
It's like pulling
freaking teeth!

701
00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:52,136
I...

702
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,407
I'm working my way
through the ingredients.

703
00:37:56,409 --> 00:38:00,010
Right.
Okay.

704
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:03,114
But at least we know
the spell we need is in there.

705
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:04,682
And we have a plan.

706
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:14,925
?

707
00:38:15,194 --> 00:38:25,002
?

708
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:35,112
?

709
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:36,480
?

710
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:40,384
Hail to the King, baby.

711
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:43,888
?

712
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:47,191
I missed him
by seconds.

713
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:50,361
Rest assured,
Lucifer will be found.

714
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:54,131
<i>And</i> killed before he causes
any more problems.

715
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,001
Or those idiot Winchesters
use him

716
00:38:57,003 --> 00:39:00,437
to open up a gate to
Michael Land.

717
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,306
Another stick-up-his-ass
archangel

718
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:04,141
is the last thing I need.

719
00:39:04,143 --> 00:39:06,377
Yes, well, Lucifer is
getting strong,

720
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:09,346
and as good as I am,
and I am...

721
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,482
very good,

722
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:15,319
I don't think even I can beat
the Devil at full power.

723
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:17,721
About that.

724
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:21,192
You recall the important errand
I had mentioned?

725
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:26,163
Word had got back to me
that a certain artifact

726
00:39:26,165 --> 00:39:28,866
I thought had been
lost forever

727
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:32,336
resurfaced.

728
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:35,539
And now it's mine.

729
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:42,379
?

730
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,248
Beautiful, isn't it?

731
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,850
Oh, yes.

732
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:52,556
The only known weapon capable
of destroying an archangel --

733
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:54,558
the archangel blade.

734
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,831
You'll forgive me,
but my reading of the lore

735
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,833
suggests that the...

736
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:06,337
blade is only effective if
wielded by an archangel.

737
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:08,606
Oh, really?

738
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,409
Thanks for the news flash.

739
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:17,314
Allow me to
make an introduction.

740
00:40:17,316 --> 00:40:19,250
Mr. Ketch...

741
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:26,924
?

742
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:33,097
?

743
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,974
Meet the Archangel Gabriel.
