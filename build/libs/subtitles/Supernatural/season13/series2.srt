1
00:00:01,976 --> 00:00:05,431
Azazel was a fanatic.
Dagon has her toys.

2
00:00:05,587 --> 00:00:07,820
If anyone bothers
a Prince of Hell...

3
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:09,689
you don't wanna know
what happens.

4
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:12,759
Crowley's dead. Kelly's dead.

5
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:14,327
Cass is...

6
00:00:16,664 --> 00:00:19,198
- Mom's gone.
- Aah!

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,268
And apparently, the Devil's kid
hit puberty in 30 seconds flat.

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,870
No!

9
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:27,340
Jack is not evil.
He's just a kid.

10
00:00:27,342 --> 00:00:30,209
My mother, she said
the world was a dangerous place.

11
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:31,744
That's why
I had to grow up fast.

12
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:34,647
She said Castiel,
he would keep me safe.

13
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,239
I think we should take him
back to the bunker.

14
00:00:36,263 --> 00:00:36,750
I agree.

15
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:39,819
Until I figure out a way
to end him,

16
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:41,687
we'll bring him home.

17
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:50,196
Protect the throne, Drexel?

18
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:52,231
Face it, we're done.

19
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:04,210
Lord Lucifer promised
he would return.

20
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:05,978
He'll pull us out of chaos.

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,981
He will
make Hell great again.

22
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:10,883
Do you even hear yourself?

23
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:16,956
What did I tell you? Hmm?

24
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:29,602
?

25
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:31,571
On your feet.

26
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:36,809
Um...
who'd you say you were?

27
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:39,011
I am Asmodeus...

28
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:40,346
Fourth Prince of Hell.

29
00:01:40,348 --> 00:01:41,848
...here to rule until
such time

30
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,218
as Lucifer returns
with his son.

31
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,920
And there are gonna be
some changes.

32
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:52,124
The underperforming
and ineffective,

33
00:01:52,126 --> 00:01:55,228
the corporate lackeys
in the Crowley era

34
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,230
are being purged.

35
00:01:57,232 --> 00:02:01,100
The grand old days
of fire and brimstone are back.

36
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:04,871
The following will
step forward --

37
00:02:04,873 --> 00:02:07,106
Mr. Drexel.

38
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,510
Mr. Harrington.

39
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:14,146
Mr. Sierra.

40
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:19,652
As for the rest of y'all...

41
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:22,488
?

42
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:43,757
There's a new sheriff in town.

43
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:47,767

45
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:04,764
Hey, we still got probably
12 hours until we're home.

46
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,198
You want me to drive?

47
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,100
Do I ever want you to drive?

48
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:12,838
Look...

49
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,142
losing Mom and Cass,

50
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,210
that's a lot to process, Dean,

51
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:20,313
especially on no sleep.

52
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:23,683
And the kid --
“The kid”?

53
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:27,219
Come on, man. You know how
this plays out.

54
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:29,055
Look, when we try
to bend the rules,

55
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:30,723
pretend that the bad guys
aren't so bad

56
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:32,925
or that things will
get fixed,

57
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:36,495
that's when people that
we care about get hurt.

58
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:38,030
And then we end up doing
what we should've done

59
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:40,366
in the first place,
which is end the problem.

60
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:44,670
So this time, let's start
with the obvious.

61
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:47,707
Soon as I find a way
to take care of...It.

62
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,676
Dean, “the problem”

63
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:53,179
might be our only shot
at saving Mom.

64
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:58,651
?

65
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:01,187
Mom's gone.

66
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:03,823
There's no fixing that.

67
00:04:09,964 --> 00:04:15,701
?

68
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:17,703
Mary, not to be critical,

69
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:20,740
but if we are ever gonna
find a way out of here, uh,

70
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:22,441
you gotta pick up the pace.

71
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:26,012
We got a lot of ground
to cover, okay?

72
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:29,815
Not sure I see the point,
since...

73
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:33,052
no matter how this plays out,

74
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:34,787
you're going to kill me.

75
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,089
Why would I kill you?

76
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,393
- Oh. That's right.
- 'Cause I'm evil.

77
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:42,995
Yeah, let me tell
you a couple things, all right?

78
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:45,431
You don't get to defy God
and beat the Cage

79
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:49,035
without having a modicum
of intelligence, all right?

80
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:51,737
A game plan, i.e.,
I don't want you dead

81
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:55,708
because I need you alive.

82
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,910
All right, look, yeah,
in a perfect world,

83
00:04:57,912 --> 00:05:01,514
I would probably kill you
and your plodding sons.

84
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:03,682
But life isn't fair.

85
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:05,584
Your sons have my boy.

86
00:05:05,586 --> 00:05:09,555
So I'm gonna exchange you
for my son.

87
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:14,693
You can't possibly care
about raising a child.

88
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:17,963
Oh, you have no idea
what I care about.

89
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:22,201
Aah!

90
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:36,549
?

91
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:39,652
What the hell?

92
00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:42,588
Mary?!

93
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,726
No trace of Lucifer.

94
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:49,328
Indeed.

95
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,097
We scoured all of Hell.

96
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:53,199
Even checked the Cage.
Nothing.

97
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:55,868
At this point, we must
focus on the son.

98
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,003
There's no sign of him
either, sir.

99
00:05:58,005 --> 00:05:59,972
Maybe a Sudden Infant Death?

100
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:02,441
He is not an infant.

101
00:06:02,443 --> 00:06:04,510
New to this world, yes,
but he is full

102
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:07,646
of timeless knowledge
and unschooled power.

103
00:06:07,648 --> 00:06:10,015
He lives. I know it.

104
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:15,621
With Lucifer gone, I want him
found and trained to rule.

105
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:19,125
With me as his humble advisor,
of course.

106
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:20,826
Okay.

107
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:24,130
“Find son,

108
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:28,334
but continue
to search for Lucifer.”

109
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:30,936
Because if we didn't,
he'd be upset,

110
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:35,307
and I-I can assure you,
from personal experience,

111
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:38,677
that an upset Lucifer
has a, uh,

112
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:41,113
short fuse.

113
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:51,323
Are you equating your paltry acquaintance
with our lord to mine?

114
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:54,360
- Uh...
- Mine, which is born

115
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:58,097
from eons of service
and sacrifice?

116
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,400
?

117
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:03,502
Ah.

118
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:07,573
I know the perils
of Lucifer's disappointment.

119
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:11,310
He...he did that?

120
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:14,980
Long ago.

121
00:07:14,982 --> 00:07:18,350
Eager to please,
I freed the Shedim.

122
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:19,818
You...

123
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,720
Oh, I've heard stories
about --

124
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:23,489
Oh, I'm sure you have.

125
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,591
Hell's most savage.

126
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:27,593
Things so dark and base,

127
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:30,763
God himself would not
allow them into the light.

128
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:36,101
But I, in my pride, believed
that I could train them.

129
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:38,370
Use them.

130
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:42,007
But Lucifer feared them,
as well he should,

131
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,776
so he forbade it,

132
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:46,445
locked them up again.

133
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:48,547
He was...

134
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:51,183
“disappointed” in me.

135
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:52,518
Mm. Mm.

136
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,221
The pain, the, uh,

137
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:57,323
the total humiliation...

138
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:01,260
it forged an eternal bond
between us.

139
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:04,797
I am his to command,

140
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:06,632
as you are mine.

141
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:11,770
Write that down.

142
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,276
This is a bad idea.
We should've just kept driving.

143
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:21,347
Dude... you were
hallucinating sheep on the road.

144
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,582
We need a few hours.

145
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:34,326
This is nice.

146
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:37,263
Let's ward the room,
get a bite,

147
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:39,632
get a few hours of sleep,
hit the road first thing.

148
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:45,804
It's...wonderful.

149
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:48,941
Hey. No.

150
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:51,510
But...
Y--

151
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:54,613
<i>?</i>

152
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:02,087
No.

153
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:03,956
And you're on the couch,
sport.

154
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,424
All right?

155
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:07,793
So why don't you go
over there?

156
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:10,429
Sit down and...
here.

157
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:12,131
Read a book.

158
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:16,368
We're out of here
in a few hours.

159
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:23,842
Jack, hey, I can take
the couch. Why don't --

160
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:26,512
No, no. It's fine.

161
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:41,060
?

162
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,339
You can slow down, you know.

163
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:55,674
That stuff's not gonna
disappear.

164
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:58,043
Ever seen <i>you</i> eat, Dean?

165
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:08,187
Wait, wait, wait. How old
do you think you are?

166
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:11,590
3 days, 17 hours,
and 42 minutes.

167
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:32,211
This book, it mentions
my father.

168
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:35,280
Not Castiel, but Lucifer.

169
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:37,282
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's --
he's big in the Bible.

170
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:39,451
Lotta screen time.

171
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:41,754
And you...knew him?

172
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:44,022
Well, he's not really
an easy guy to know.

173
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:48,127
He's, um, he's kind of rough
around the edges.

174
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,496
He's Satan.

175
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:53,298
And that's...that's bad.

176
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,867
Damn straight.

177
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:59,238
See...he turned
on his father, God.

178
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,607
God. He's in here, too.

179
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:04,109
Is he famous or something?

180
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:08,247
Yeah. Um, God basically...

181
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:10,115
created everything.

182
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:11,683
Yeah, and then he skipped out,

183
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:14,420
leaving guys like us to clean up
his messes like Lucifer.

184
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:17,423
So God's like my grandfather.

185
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:20,793
He's family, and that's...

186
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:23,429
that's good.
Sometimes.

187
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:28,200
Okay, all right, will you stop?

188
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:33,572
So, Jack, we know Kelly taught
you things before you were born.

189
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:35,874
And obviously, you can,
you know,

190
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:39,978
make people or things move
with your mind.

191
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,014
But, um...

192
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:44,650
what else can you do?

193
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:48,120
I...

194
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:49,855
don't know.

195
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,492
Okay.

196
00:11:53,494 --> 00:11:55,761
For instance,
say you wanted to --

197
00:11:55,763 --> 00:11:58,297
to be someplace else
right now.

198
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,965
Could you?

199
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:03,502
Can you teleport?

200
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:06,205
“Teleport.”

201
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:07,806
Yes.

202
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:10,108
If you wanted to be on
the other side of that door

203
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,045
right this instant,
what would you do?

204
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:19,117
What...

205
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:26,425
Great.

206
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:35,868
You know, it's possible
he's more human than we thought.

207
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,370
Mm-hmm.

208
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:45,277
Like that?

209
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,279
Come on.

210
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:48,847
You're trying to tell me
you didn't pick up anything

211
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:50,182
before you were born?

212
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:53,552
That your father never
reached out to you?

213
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:59,725
?

214
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:01,593
What?

215
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:03,762
Jack? Hey.

216
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:05,797
You all right?

217
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:09,134
Yeah. Uh, good.

218
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:12,371
I'm good.

219
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:23,715
?

220
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:27,052
All right, I say we, uh...
get some rest.

221
00:13:27,054 --> 00:13:29,588
It's been a long day.
We're startin' early tomorrow.

222
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:41,667
?

223
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:47,773
?

224
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:49,474
Uhh!

225
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,980
Donatello?

226
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:58,317
Sam? Dean?

227
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:02,020
Is God with you?

228
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:04,556
?

229
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:14,371
You okay?

230
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:16,306
Ah, pretty much.

231
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:18,875
No soul of course,
thanks to Amara.

232
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:20,977
It's kinda like
losing your appendix.

233
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:23,380
You never really noticed it
when you had it.

234
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:26,316
But now, when I come
to a moral crossroad,

235
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:30,754
I ask myself,
“What would Mr. Rogers do?”

236
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:34,190
And as soon as I nail that,
I'm usually good.

237
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:36,659
Why are you here?

238
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:38,762
Yes.

239
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:43,166
That is the question
we all must ask.

240
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:44,968
Why are you in Wyoming?

241
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,971
Oh. Uh, Well...

242
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:50,573
after God left,
I said to myself,

243
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:53,376
“Donatello, you are so retired”"

244
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:54,644
I mean, who needs
a prophet of God

245
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:57,013
when there is no God?

246
00:14:57,015 --> 00:14:58,415
So... a few days ago,

247
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,183
I'm online,
checking out condos in Boca,

248
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:05,088
and I am knocked off my feet by
this weird wave of power.

249
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,524
Not exactly like God's.

250
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:11,461
More like...something new,
something fresh.

251
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:13,296
I was drawn to it.

252
00:15:13,298 --> 00:15:14,931
It's here.

253
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:19,202
Wow.

254
00:15:19,204 --> 00:15:21,771
<i>Right</i> here.

255
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:24,441
It's...

256
00:15:24,443 --> 00:15:25,842
you.

257
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:27,911
Who are you?

258
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:30,547
I'm...Jack.

259
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:31,881
Jack is a nephilim.

260
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:35,752
A child
of a human and an angel.

261
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:38,621
Archangel, actually.

262
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:40,223
Um...Lucifer.

263
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:41,558
Lucifer?

264
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,359
And Donatello here
is a prophet.

265
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:46,529
Which means he has a direct line
to God, or Heaven.

266
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:49,032
Yes, well, not so much anymore.

267
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:52,635
But, uh...

268
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:55,238
Look at you.

269
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,075
The waves of power...

270
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:00,510
so intense.

271
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:01,978
Maybe less human than
we thought.

272
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,013
Fascinating.

273
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:06,416
You know, I've met
your father.

274
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:09,986
Your power's nothing like his.
Not dark, not toxic.

275
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:11,588
That so?

276
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,022
Not yet.

277
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,724
If Jack is sending out
a signal strong enough

278
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:17,393
to get Donatello
all the way out here...

279
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:18,995
The angels are still
out there.

280
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:21,431
I mean, who knows what else
might be listening?

281
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,899
He needs protection.

282
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:25,068
?

283
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,504
All right, so, uh...

284
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:30,473
I'm thinking something
like this, right about here.

285
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:33,243
Uh, you know what?
Exactly like that.

286
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:35,044
And you're cool with this?

287
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:36,846
Yeah.

288
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:38,481
Turn the damn thing on
and start buzzin'.

289
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:42,652
W-we're brothers. It's kind of
like a family crest.

290
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:47,624
<i>?</i>

291
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:51,060
So you heard Donatello.
No evil vibes from Jack.

292
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:53,563
Proves nothing,

293
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:55,965
except you're way too attached
to this kid.

294
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:58,301
You need to see this
for what it is, okay?

295
00:16:58,303 --> 00:17:00,069
I mean, what do you need,
a sign?

296
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:04,274
Dean, whatever his powers
are or will be...

297
00:17:04,276 --> 00:17:07,644
...if we train him properly,
they could be used for good.

298
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:09,145
Aah!

299
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:10,713
Uhh!

300
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,583
Well, there's your sign.

301
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:16,686
Did you do that?
I'm not sure.

302
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:20,323
Hey. You all right?

303
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:22,592
It hurt.

304
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:24,861
Okay, see, sometimes,
things hurt,

305
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:27,764
so you just man up
and deal with it.

306
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:30,900
Yes. I understand.

307
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:32,902
Pain is a part of
the complete human experience.

308
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:35,138
Accepting it is
a sign of maturity.

309
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,973
All right.

310
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:38,908
I think your, uh, machine
might've fritzed out there.

311
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,144
You might wanna
get that looked at.

312
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:43,646
Uh...
Yeah.

313
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,891
Okeydokey.

314
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,434
Looks good, Jack.

315
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:15,878
?

316
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,115
Well, there's your second sign.

317
00:18:25,323 --> 00:18:30,093
?

318
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:33,863
?

319
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:35,632
It was a reflex.
He didn't do it on purpose.

320
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:38,034
Who cares if he didn't do
it on purpose? He did it.

321
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:39,936
I mean, you didn't see Cass
smiting someone

322
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:41,771
every time he got his teeth cleaned.
I'm right here, you know.

323
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:43,339
Yeah, and what about
the vanishing tattoo?

324
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:45,108
An archangel healing itself.

325
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,248
Another reflex.

326
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:47,979
Or maybe he didn't want
to be warded.

327
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,281
Okay, look, yeah, Jack is on
Lucifer's family tree.

328
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:52,015
But we don't know if that DNA
is stronger than Kelly's,

329
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:53,549
or his connection
with Cass.

330
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:55,218
Oh, you mean the connection
that got Cass killed?

331
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,453
I'm just saying,
Jack doesn't have to be evil.

332
00:18:57,455 --> 00:18:58,888
We can teach him not to be.

333
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,456
Ah.

334
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,159
- The nature versus nurture conundrum.
- Hey.

335
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:04,727
Mnh-mnh.
Dude...

336
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:08,431
Oh. Speaking not as a prophet
but as a scientist,

337
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:12,402
I don't think teaching him
is in the cards.

338
00:19:12,404 --> 00:19:14,537
It's like asking a lion
not to be a lion.

339
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:16,906
But this isn't
a lion! This is a human!

340
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:18,975
With a strong dose
of God juice.

341
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:20,510
Okay. that's it.
I'm done, all right?

342
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:22,812
'Cause he's not God,
he's not Cass, he's not Simba.

343
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:25,081
He's the friggin' Devil!

344
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,383
Jack?

345
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:28,785
Uh-oh.

346
00:19:28,787 --> 00:19:35,224
?

347
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:38,528
<i>I love you, Jack.</i>

348
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:42,031
<i>I love you so much.</i>

349
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:46,803
<i>You are gonna be amazing.</i>

350
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:48,705
Jack?

351
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:50,340
Jack?

352
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:55,845
Hey.

353
00:19:57,148 --> 00:20:00,350
Hey, bud. We, uh,
we've been looking for ya.

354
00:20:03,488 --> 00:20:07,490
I'm sorry. I...

355
00:20:07,492 --> 00:20:10,326
Everyone was so angry.

356
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,931
Yeah, and, um...

357
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:18,701
I suppose you wanted
to be away from it.

358
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:21,371
And suddenly, I was.

359
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:28,911
I'll tell you what.

360
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:31,314
You got some
special skills, Jack.

361
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:33,783
That's for sure.

362
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:37,487
We just need to make sure
we get a grip on 'em, so...

363
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:39,555
so you don't hurt anybody.

364
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,527
Is that why Dean hates me?

365
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:47,497
Dean doesn't hate you.
It...

366
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,933
Look, sometimes the wires
in Dean's head get crossed

367
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:53,136
and -- and he gets frustrated,

368
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:55,071
and then he mixes
frustration with anger,

369
00:20:55,073 --> 00:20:57,707
and -- and -- and fear.

370
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:02,211
Why would he be afraid?

371
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:06,749
Because Dean feels like it's
his job to protect everyone.

372
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:11,954
And right now,
we need to protect you.

373
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:17,059
But we may also need
to protect people <i>from</i> you.

374
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:25,802
Maybe I'm not worth
all this.

375
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:29,872
Your mom thought you were.

376
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:32,708
So did Cass.

377
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,444
So do I.

378
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,887
<i>? I'll be working</i>
<i>on the graveyard shift ?</i>

379
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,457
Getcha another?

380
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:48,925
Yeah. Sure.

381
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:50,359
What the hell?
You're not drivin', right?

382
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:53,162
I've just -- I've seen you
around the hotel.

383
00:21:53,164 --> 00:21:55,198
Passin' through with...
what, your buddies?

384
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,068
Uh, that's my brother,
and some messed up kid.

385
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,437
Oh, the kid's messed up?

386
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:03,706
Yeah, issues with his dad.

387
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,107
The older fella.

388
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:08,644
No, that's, uh, Donatello.
Uh, he's a...

389
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:10,213
guy we work with.

390
00:22:10,215 --> 00:22:13,249
I hated my old man.
I ran away myself.

391
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:15,418
See, my mom would never
stick up for me.

392
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,286
But...
you know kids.

393
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:20,389
No matter what, they still want
the old man's approval.

394
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:22,225
Well, that's how it was
with me, just...

395
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:24,727
You know, that's, uh,

396
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:26,395
that's how it was
with me, too.

397
00:22:26,397 --> 00:22:28,798
I'm talkin' your ear off I'll --
I'll grab you that drink.

398
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,301
You know what? I'm good.
Uh, I'm gonna take a walk.

399
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:38,875
There you go. Thank you.
Thanks.

400
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:41,644
<i>? I'll be working</i>
<i>on the graveyard shift ?</i>

401
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:45,748
<i>? Until I die ?</i>

402
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:53,456
?

403
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:05,074
Come in.

404
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,378
- Hey.
- Hi.

405
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,113
Good morning.

406
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:11,614
How's Jack?

407
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,651
Uh, by the way,
sorry to stick him with you.

408
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:17,620
Things got a little tense
here last night,

409
00:23:17,622 --> 00:23:20,857
so I figured it'd be better
to have him stay in your room.

410
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:24,494
It's not a big deal.
He's an interesting kid.

411
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:27,897
Yeah. Yeah,
that's an understatement.

412
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:31,868
Let -- let me ask ya...

413
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,105
Do you have any idea
how powerful he'll get to be?

414
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,077
I-I don't. No.

415
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:45,748
But the, uh, the lore says,
quote,

416
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,850
“A nephilim becomes
more powerful

417
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:49,752
than the angel who sired it.”

418
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:52,655
In this case, the sire is
an archangel.

419
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:54,290
So...

420
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:59,095
Does he know about
his father?

421
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:00,663
Vaguely.

422
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:04,567
So he's not bonded
to Lucifer.

423
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,803
He seems to have a real
attachment to his mom,

424
00:24:06,805 --> 00:24:10,406
but only kind of
a fuzzy idea about his dad.

425
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,276
And his mom, Kelly,
was a really good person,

426
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:16,412
so that makes me think Jack can
be molded the right way.

427
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:19,015
Mm, molded.

428
00:24:20,452 --> 00:24:22,952
I hope you're right.
Yeah.

429
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:46,809
?

430
00:24:46,811 --> 00:24:48,344
Who the hell are you?

431
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:50,913
Mary.

432
00:24:50,915 --> 00:24:52,682
Mary Winchester.

433
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:54,550
I'm a Hunter.

434
00:24:54,552 --> 00:24:56,319
Doubt it.

435
00:24:57,722 --> 00:24:59,355
Come here.

436
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:07,063
You don't walk like an angel.

437
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:10,833
They all walk like they got
sticks up their asses.

438
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:19,342
Not a demon neither.

439
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:22,445
I told you.

440
00:25:23,548 --> 00:25:25,681
I ain't never met
a female Hunter.

441
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:29,118
Not many women, period,
since the wars began.

442
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,653
Wars?

443
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,655
What rock you been under?

444
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:36,225
I'm not from around here.

445
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:39,162
Oh.
I don't know anything...

446
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:42,632
I just got attacked by some kind
of fireball or something.

447
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:46,002
Angels, yeah.

448
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,837
Always takin' shots.

449
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,374
Maybe I can...help you

450
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:53,910
find your way.

451
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:55,311
I'm good.

452
00:25:55,313 --> 00:25:58,314
Ah. Let's keep
this friendly, huh?

453
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:01,484
Bitch!

454
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:05,254
?

455
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:07,323
Uhh!

456
00:26:10,328 --> 00:26:14,997
?

457
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,332
You're welcome.

458
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:18,534
Uh, Mary, in case
you didn't notice this,

459
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,369
you left without me.

460
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,538
What is wrong with you?

461
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,641
We need each other.
This is a win-win situation.

462
00:26:25,643 --> 00:26:28,211
Okay? We get outta this...
theme park,

463
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,279
we both get our boys back.

464
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:33,349
You think I want you to win?

465
00:26:47,665 --> 00:26:51,334
Yeah, I'm -- I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to insist.

466
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,275
Hey.
Hey.

467
00:26:59,277 --> 00:27:00,676
We should probably hit it.

468
00:27:00,678 --> 00:27:02,345
Uh, I was just gonna
call you, actually.

469
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:05,047
Um, look...

470
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,451
we are gonna be on the road
a long time today. Right?

471
00:27:08,453 --> 00:27:11,187
Yeah. Well, you know, we don't
have to be 'cause your new pal

472
00:27:11,189 --> 00:27:14,290
could just zap us back
to the bunker like that.

473
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:17,159
Point is...

474
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:18,761
if you and I are gonna
do this,

475
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,596
keep Jack on
the right side of things,

476
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,698
then -- then we have to be
on the same page.

477
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,533
Okay. Well, that's the problem,
though, Sam,

478
00:27:24,535 --> 00:27:27,103
'cause we're not on
the same page. Like, at all.

479
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,675
All right. You know what?
I know what's going on here.

480
00:27:32,677 --> 00:27:35,378
Oh. Okay. Well, please, tell me,
what's going on here?

481
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,813
You thinking Mom is gone
and Cass is gone,

482
00:27:37,815 --> 00:27:39,849
and that Jack can't be saved.

483
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:45,755
Dean, after everything
we've gone through...

484
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:48,925
We just lost people we love,

485
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:52,094
people who have been
in our lives for a long time.

486
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:54,463
Everything's upside-down.
I get it.

487
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:58,167
But we've been down before.
I mean, rock bottom.

488
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:00,536
And we find a way.

489
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:02,772
We fix it because that's
what we do.

490
00:28:02,774 --> 00:28:06,142
And Jack wants to do
the right thing.

491
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,844
Jack's scared to death
of who he is,

492
00:28:08,846 --> 00:28:10,513
and he's scared of <i>you.</i>

493
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,250
Come in.

494
00:28:14,252 --> 00:28:15,985
Morning, guys.

495
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:19,889
Uh, got a minute? I, uh,
wanna talk to you about Jack.

496
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:22,291
We just talked about Jack.

497
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:25,461
- What?
- You were just here.

498
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:26,829
No, I wasn't.

499
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,498
I was grabbing
breakfast burritos. Extra spicy.

500
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:39,308
?

501
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,811
Jack?

502
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:43,279
He's gone.

503
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:45,781
?

504
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,934
Okay, okay, so -- so --
so -soso who's got Jack?

505
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:55,970
And who was I -- or what was
I talking to? A shifter?

506
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:58,038
What would a shifter want
with Jack?

507
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:03,444
?

508
00:29:03,446 --> 00:29:05,112
Where you going, cowboy?

509
00:29:05,114 --> 00:29:07,581
He -- he went this way.

510
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:08,883
You sure?

511
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:11,018
I can feel it.

512
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,586
I'll get the gear.

513
00:29:12,588 --> 00:29:19,093
?

514
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:28,636
?

515
00:29:33,242 --> 00:29:35,276
Aah! Uhh!

516
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,648
?

517
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:46,820
?

518
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,027
?

519
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:03,971
First angels, now demons.
Terrific.

520
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:06,307
I guess the word's out.

521
00:30:07,643 --> 00:30:09,176
Donatello.

522
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:18,452
?

523
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:20,020
Aah!

524
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:24,325
Uhh!

525
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:35,569
Uh, housekeeping
is not gonna like this.

526
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:50,651
Jack.

527
00:30:56,125 --> 00:31:00,294
As a prophet, Jack,
I speak the words of God.

528
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:01,729
Do you know who God is?

529
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:03,530
Yes.

530
00:31:03,532 --> 00:31:05,199
Kind of.

531
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:09,870
Well, son, God has
a message for you.

532
00:31:09,872 --> 00:31:12,973
You must prepare yourself,
Jack.

533
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:16,110
Train yourself to use
your gifts,

534
00:31:16,112 --> 00:31:17,978
to fulfill your destiny.

535
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,547
How?

536
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:26,220
Long ago, a troop
of God's bravest soldiers

537
00:31:26,222 --> 00:31:29,923
were trapped in a distant cavern
of a place called Hell.

538
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:32,192
I've read about Hell.

539
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:33,827
It doesn't sound nice.

540
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:36,964
It's not. That's why we have
to rescue the soldiers.

541
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:40,067
They're called the Shedim,

542
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:43,570
and God wants you to
set them free,

543
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:46,106
to be a hero.

544
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:47,875
I could <i>do</i> that?

545
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:50,511
And so much more.

546
00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:52,346
Uh...

547
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:54,948
You see that patch of earth
there?

548
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,685
Imagine the force of your will,

549
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:00,688
drilling down
into infinite darkness,

550
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,890
the soldiers being drawn
to the surface.

551
00:32:02,892 --> 00:32:04,391
Do it, Jack!

552
00:32:04,393 --> 00:32:06,260
Do it for God!

553
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:10,597
?

554
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,766
Focus!

555
00:32:12,768 --> 00:32:14,234
I'm trying.

556
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:16,070
Try harder, boy!

557
00:32:16,072 --> 00:32:20,274
?

558
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:24,678
Turn!

559
00:32:25,948 --> 00:32:28,348
Th-- this is worrisome.

560
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:31,051
I'm sensing a power emanation
alongside Jack's.

561
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:33,921
It gets stronger the closer
we get to it.

562
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:36,156
Jasper, Wyoming?

563
00:32:36,158 --> 00:32:37,591
Maybe it's an angel.

564
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:40,427
No. Something dark.

565
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:42,229
Do you ever have
any good news?

566
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:43,831
All right, well,

567
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,899
see if there's anything
in Jasper that's demon-y.

568
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:47,367
Yeah, there is.

569
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,969
According to Dad's journal,

570
00:32:48,971 --> 00:32:51,739
Jasper is home to
its very own Gate to Hell.

571
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:53,407
It gets better.
Fantastic.

572
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:55,542
According to legend,
this particular gate

573
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:59,613
leads to, “A place where
unimaginable evil emanates

574
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:02,549
from creatures too wicked
for the Pit to hold.”

575
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:04,084
What the hell does
that mean?

576
00:33:04,086 --> 00:33:07,321
They're really bad.

577
00:33:07,323 --> 00:33:10,324
?

578
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:12,159
Ah! Turn!

579
00:33:12,161 --> 00:33:15,696
Are you tired? Really?

580
00:33:15,698 --> 00:33:18,065
You know what? Let me tell you
a couple things.

581
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:20,067
First of all, we gotta blow
this taco stand

582
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:22,469
before who knows what
happens to my son.

583
00:33:22,471 --> 00:33:25,339
And second of all, you're the reason
that we are even stuck

584
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:27,641
in this literally godforsaken
place to begin with.

585
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:29,643
So I'm sorry you're tired.

586
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:32,212
It's not my fault you were
born a wimpy little human

587
00:33:32,214 --> 00:33:35,849
with your wimpy little lungs
and your weak little legs.

588
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:37,718
What?
You heard me.

589
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,459
Don't say another word
on this trip, okay?

590
00:33:41,757 --> 00:33:44,191
?

591
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:47,227
Just what I need.

592
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:49,830
Angels.

593
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:51,698
Hey.

594
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,901
I sense a creature that
stinks of Hell.

595
00:33:53,903 --> 00:33:55,736
Oh, yeah. That would be her.

596
00:33:55,738 --> 00:33:57,304
False!

597
00:33:57,306 --> 00:33:58,939
Identify yourself.

598
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:02,843
I'm Lucifer.

599
00:34:02,845 --> 00:34:04,912
False.

600
00:34:04,914 --> 00:34:06,380
No, I'm pretty sure
I'm -- I'm Lucifer.

601
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:08,849
- You wanna tell this guy who I am?
- False.

602
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:11,385
Lucifer was killed
by the archangel Michael.

603
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:13,053
What?

604
00:34:13,055 --> 00:34:14,922
This place is nuts!

605
00:34:14,924 --> 00:34:16,390
Freeze!

606
00:34:16,392 --> 00:34:18,759
Oh, what are you gonna....

607
00:34:18,761 --> 00:34:20,661
Are you gonna smite me?

608
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:23,564
- On my command.
- Oh, for the love of...

609
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:26,733
Now!

610
00:34:26,735 --> 00:34:28,368
Aah!

611
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:34,508
Was he kidding?

612
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,476
I mean, even in
land of Bizarro,

613
00:34:36,478 --> 00:34:38,445
an Angel isn't gonna
try to...

614
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,324
Oh, come on!

615
00:34:52,194 --> 00:35:01,969
?

616
00:35:02,238 --> 00:35:03,937
?

617
00:35:03,939 --> 00:35:06,673
You should be dead.

618
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:10,711
<i>Okay.</i> And who are you,

619
00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:14,014
and what spaghetti western
coughed you up?

620
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:17,317
Don't you know me, brother?

621
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:20,587
Michael?

622
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:23,156
Summon up all your will, Jack!

623
00:35:23,158 --> 00:35:24,725
Do it for God!

624
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,130
?

625
00:35:30,132 --> 00:35:33,767
Ah! Aha! Ah! You're doing it!

626
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,102
He's doing it! Yes!

627
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:42,943
?

628
00:35:42,945 --> 00:35:44,544
It's working!

629
00:35:44,546 --> 00:35:48,315
Don't lose focus!
Don't lose focus, Jack!

630
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:50,550
Yes! Yes!

631
00:35:50,552 --> 00:35:53,453
He's doing it! Keep focused!

632
00:35:55,658 --> 00:36:02,696
?

633
00:36:02,698 --> 00:36:05,165
Jack! Hey! Stop.

634
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,968
Don't listen to them, Jack!
Holy crap!

635
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:12,739
Focus!
That's not Donatello!

636
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:15,075
No, <i>that's</i> not Donatello!

637
00:36:15,077 --> 00:36:16,643
Ah, screw this.

638
00:36:17,947 --> 00:36:21,949
?

639
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:24,818
Jack, he's a demon!

640
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,219
Howdy, boys.

641
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:28,622
No!

642
00:36:28,624 --> 00:36:32,392
?

643
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:37,731
Jack...they wanna stop you.

644
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:39,633
Contain you.

645
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:43,370
<i>I</i> can give you the world.

646
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:56,817
You're hurting my friends!

647
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:03,690
?

648
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:19,873
?

649
00:37:20,142 --> 00:37:22,676
?

650
00:37:33,249 --> 00:37:35,583
You <i>are</i> Lucifer.

651
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:37,852
I can feel it.

652
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:40,555
But how is that even possible?

653
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:42,290
Um...

654
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:46,294
You know, alternate universes,
interdimensional travel,

655
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:48,763
blah, blah, blah.
It's her fault.

656
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:53,067
Uh, I'll buy that
you're Michael,

657
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:55,870
but you sort of seem like
a cheap knockoff

658
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:59,373
to the one I left behind,
and he's a hot mess.

659
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:02,910
I killed my Lucifer.

660
00:38:02,912 --> 00:38:06,314
Tore him apart
in the skies over Abilene.

661
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:09,817
But hey, can't get enough
of a good thing.

662
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:15,857
Um...Okay. Why not?

663
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:20,761
?

664
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:30,671
?

665
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:39,213
Hurt?

666
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:41,449
No.
It's kinda wimpy.

667
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:43,718
Aah!

668
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,488
What are you
gonna do? Kill me?

669
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,291
Or...maybe not.

670
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:52,927
Maybe I need you.

671
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:06,140
These yellow-eyed things
just keep on comin', huh?

672
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:08,109
Mm-hmm.

673
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:09,710
And hopefully this
fourth Prince of Hell

674
00:39:09,712 --> 00:39:12,146
is the last Kardashian
in the family.

675
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:16,817
According to this,
if that <i>was</i> Asmodeus,

676
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:18,486
it's the end of the line.

677
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:27,495
Dean, wait a second.

678
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:33,267
The kid came through
for us today.

679
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:35,436
Jack saved us.

680
00:39:35,438 --> 00:39:36,938
No.

681
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,340
No, whatever that was,
that was a reflex.

682
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:41,142
It was a sneeze.

683
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:44,478
Maybe next time he sneezes,
he kills us.

684
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:49,817
Good night.

685
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:14,675
Ah!

686
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,652
Mnh.

687
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:29,423
Okay, what the hell?

688
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:33,194
Give me that. You --

689
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:35,062
W--

690
00:40:35,064 --> 00:40:36,664
Don't be an idiot.

691
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,699
Look, A, this is not gonna
do anything to you, okay?

692
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:40,701
And B, you...

693
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:42,169
What the hell?

694
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:44,739
Exactly. What the hell am I?

695
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,681
I can't control...

696
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:56,283
whatever this is.

697
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:04,358
I <i>will</i> hurt someone.

698
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:10,464
?

699
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:13,567
You know, my brother thinks
you can be saved.

700
00:41:14,937 --> 00:41:17,138
You don't believe that.

701
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:20,908
No, I don't.

702
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,180
So...

703
00:41:26,182 --> 00:41:29,050
if you're right?

704
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:31,318
If I'm right...

705
00:41:33,689 --> 00:41:36,223
...and it comes to
killing you...

706
00:41:37,894 --> 00:41:39,827
...I'll be the one
to do it.

707
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:45,666
?

708
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:54,375
