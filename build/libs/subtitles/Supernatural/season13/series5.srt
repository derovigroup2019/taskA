1
00:00:02,094 --> 00:00:03,593
This life --

2
00:00:03,595 --> 00:00:06,329
hunting, monsters...

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,465
there's no joy in it.
Uhh!

4
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:11,201
There's nothing but pain...

5
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:13,637
horror...

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,172
and death.

7
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:18,341
You and your brother
keep coming back.

8
00:00:18,343 --> 00:00:21,912
You're an affront
to the balance of universe,

9
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:24,981
and you cause disruption
on a global scale.

10
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:29,352
So the next time
you or your brother bite it,

11
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:32,422
we're gonna toss you out
into the Empty.

12
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:35,792
And <i>nothing</i>
comes back from that.

13
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,166
Listen, man...

14
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,868
I'm sorry for being
a dick lately.

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,170
Right now, I don't believe
in a damn thing.

16
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,574
I need you to keep the faith
for both of us.

17
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:09,826
?

18
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,598
You got a full battery?

19
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:19,169
Yep.

20
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,570
You ready?

21
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:22,005
Yeah.

22
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:31,281
?

23
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,984
?

24
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:35,919
We're gonna get so many hits.

25
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:40,757
?

26
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,426
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

27
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:45,428
What?
Are you sure about this?

28
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,764
Come on, man.
It'll be awesome.

29
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:57,174
?

30
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:06,783
Told you it'd
be unlocked.

31
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:09,119
Why would they
leave it open?

32
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:12,289
Who's “they”? Come on. No one
even pretends to own this place,

33
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,457
not after --
Whatever. Don't start.

34
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,393
What, you don't wanna
hear about the guy

35
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:18,628
who used to cut open
people's skulls?

36
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,797
Sure. Of course he did,
Evan.

37
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:22,666
No, seriously.
He got arrested.

38
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:25,001
So if he cuts
your skull open,

39
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:27,537
will you shut
your stupid mouth?

40
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:38,381
Why do we have to go
up there?

41
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:41,284
Uh-oh. Someone's scared.

42
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,286
I'm not scared. I just...

43
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,589
Mike punked out.
At least I showed up.

44
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:49,125
Good. If you're so brave,
let's look around.

45
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,610
?

46
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:08,879
Where he kept
his patients.

47
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:18,488
?

48
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:22,092
?

49
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:24,361
Evan,
I don't like this, man.

50
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:26,396
Quit your whining.

51
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:39,576
?

52
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:42,312
So...Yeah, I'm not going
in there.

53
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:45,015
Fine. Be a little baby.

54
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:51,888
Come on, man.

55
00:03:51,890 --> 00:04:00,630
?

56
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,267
Told ya.

57
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,069
This guy was freaky.

58
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,939
Evan.

59
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:10,106
Come check this out.

60
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:14,978
?

61
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,947
Holy crap.

62
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:22,152
Put it in your bag.

63
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:23,620
What? No.

64
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:25,088
Dude, nut up.

65
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,325
Fine, just...hurry.

66
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:35,732
D-- What was that?
Nothing.

67
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,868
It was just a weird, like,
house noise. Or the wind.

68
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:52,082
Yeah, I'm out.
Shawn, come on, don't be --

69
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,059
Go! Keep moving!

70
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:04,627
Come on, let's go!

71
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:11,801

72
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:13,203
No! No!

73
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:29,986
?

74
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,658

Yep.

80
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,579
You want a beer with that?

I'm cool?

What's going on with you?

85
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:08,124
What do you mean?

86
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:11,394
Anyway, check this out.
I think I found something.

87
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:14,397
Three days ago,
kid named Shawn Raider

88
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,965
was found wandering
on the side of the road

89
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,234
near Grand Junction, Colorado,
bleeding from the head.

90
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:19,669
Best friend was missing.

91
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,806
And get this --
only word he said?

92
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:24,240
“Monster.”

93
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:26,576
Okay. Well, that sounds
like something.

94
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:29,045
Yeah. So I thought we'd
check it out, you and me.

95
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:31,281
What about Jack?

96
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:33,850
He's, uh, he's catching up
on all my old fantasy DVDs --

97
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,153
“Red Sonia,” “Beast Master,”
uh, “Beast Master II” --

98
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:38,721
you know, with
the time traveling ferrets.

99
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:41,691
Yeah. Wow how you ever
got laid, I'll never know.

100
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,194
Yeah,
tell me about it.

101
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,664
So I was thinking
we'd leave Jack behind.

102
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,101
Really?

103
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:54,204
Yeah. We'll put up some
extra warding. He'll be fine.

104
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,939
I mean, when's the last time
we worked a case,

105
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:57,340
just you and me?

106
00:06:57,342 --> 00:06:59,943
It's been a while.

107
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:02,812
Exactly. So?

108
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,229
Here.

109
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,333
Agent Page? I thought you always
liked to be Agent Page.

110
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:26,503
Yeah, well, changing it up.

111
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:32,175
Can I help you?

112
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:33,710
Yeah, sorry to
bother you, ma'am.

113
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:35,311
Agents Page and Plant. FBI.

114
00:07:35,313 --> 00:07:39,082
We're here to follow up
on the incident with your son.

115
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,551
Well, the police have already
been here.

116
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:43,286
Shouldn't you talk to them?

117
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:46,823
We did, but we'd like to speak
with you as well. And Shawn.

118
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:50,960
Something wrong?

119
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:53,663
Shawn, he...

120
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:55,498
he won't talk.

121
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,267
He can't.

122
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,068
What do you mean?

123
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,337
The doctors say...

124
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:04,474
he's okay physically,
that it's psychological.

125
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:07,610
- You know, trauma, like he...
- he...

126
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,814
saw some-- saw something
so...awful.

127
00:08:11,816 --> 00:08:13,917
God, I don't even know
what he was doing out that late.

128
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:19,856
Shawn?

129
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:21,925
Hey, I'm Dean.

130
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:27,430
I heard you had
a rough time.

131
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:29,666
You wanna tell me about it?

132
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:37,707
?

133
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:42,712
And, uh, Evan,
he's still missing.

134
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:44,981
Uh...

135
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,750
He, Shawn, and their friend
Mike Ramos,

136
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:50,186
they're inseparable.

137
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:52,121
So has anybody spoken
with Mike?

138
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:53,656
Everyone.

139
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,427
He says he doesn't know
what happened, but...

140
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:58,995
But you don't believe him.

141
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:04,033
Those boys do everything
together. I just...

142
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:06,936
I just --
I just don't know.

143
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:09,105
What is that? A monster?

144
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:11,274
Is this the one
you told the cops about?

145
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,649
You know...

146
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,687
I know what it's like
to see monsters.

147
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,590
And I know that even when
they're gone,

148
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:30,493
they never really go away.

149
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:32,462
You see 'em when
you close your eyes.

150
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:34,764
You see 'em
in your dreams...

151
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:38,401
But you know what?

152
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:40,937
Me and my brother?

153
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:43,306
We're the guys that stop
the monsters.

154
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:46,809
We're the guys that
scare <i>them.</i>

155
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:48,945
But you gotta talk to me.

156
00:09:52,417 --> 00:10:00,256
?

157
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,094
So he didn't say anything?
Not a word.

158
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:07,563
Whatever that kid saw,
it messed him up.

159
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,399
Well, I say we talk
to the other friend, uh, Mike,

160
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,234
first thing in the morning.
Sounds like a plan.

161
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,636
- So, strip club?
- Wait.

162
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:15,338
Sorry. What?

163
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,507
Mm, s-strip...club.

164
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:20,076
There's one
just outside of town,

165
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,178
the, uh...

166
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,546
Clamdiver.

167
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:26,382
<i>You</i> wanna go
to the <i>Clamdiver?</i>

168
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:29,118
Yeah.
It -- it got great reviews.

169
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,455
You read reviews
for the Clamdiver?

170
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,424
It -- it -- it got
four and a half --

171
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,025
Dude, what is going on
with you?

172
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:37,994
What are you talking about?
All day.

173
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:40,129
You give me a-a beer
for breakfast.

174
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:43,099
You -- you gave me Agent Page,
which you always like to be.

175
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,803
You -- you didn't whine about me
blaring my music the whole way here.

176
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:48,838
And when we stopped for lunch,
you ordered me chili fries.

177
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,873
You love chili fries.

178
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,009
Everybody loves chili fries.
That's not the point.

179
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:55,178
Now you wanna go hang out
at a strip club?

180
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,612
You hate strip clubs.

181
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,448
No, I don't.

182
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,483
Dude, the last lap dance you had
was -- was -- was at Christmas.

183
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,652
It was a gift
paid for by me.

184
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:04,487
You spent the entire song
trying to convince the girl

185
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:08,324
that she should go to
nursing school.

186
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:10,093
So what is it?
It is my birthday?

187
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:12,995
Did -- did I win a bet that
I don't know about? What?

188
00:11:12,997 --> 00:11:16,532
No, nothing. Nothing. I-I mean,
I'm just trying to be nice.

189
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:18,901
-Why?
- Because...

190
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,240
You know why.

191
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:27,777
I'm fine.

192
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,712
No, you're not, Dean.

193
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:31,214
You said you don't believe
in anything,

194
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:33,383
and -- and that's...
that's not true. That's not you.

195
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:35,051
You -- you -- you do
believe in things.

196
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:36,552
You do believe in people.
That's who you are.

197
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:38,121
That's what you do.

198
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:40,390
I know you're in a dark place,
and I-I just wanna help.

199
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:41,691
Okay.

200
00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:44,260
Look, I-I've been down
this road before.

201
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:45,528
and fought my way back.

202
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,397
I will fight my way back
again.

203
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,365
How?

204
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,634
Same way I always do --

205
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:53,636
bullets, bacon, and booze.

206
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,106
A lotta booze.

207
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:03,746
Shawn!

208
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:06,616
It's okay.
It's okay, baby.

209
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:09,185
Just a bad dream.

210
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:13,723
?

211
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:16,692
Try to get some sleep,
all right?

212
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:19,862
Okay.

213
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,267
That's good.

214
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,803
That's good.

215
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:42,785
?

216
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:48,191
?

217
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:06,809
?

218
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,319
Great.

219
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:51,727
?

220
00:13:55,099 --> 00:14:05,341
?

221
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:17,787
So...you don't know where
Shawn went that night?

222
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:20,723
No. I already told the cops.

223
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,358
Right. Of course.
But problem is,

224
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,927
when something bad happens,
we have to triple-check.

225
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,964
Anyway,
I wasn't with them.

226
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:31,067
“Them”
You weren't with them.

227
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:35,304
So Shawn was with somebody.
Maybe your friend Evan?

228
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:38,007
I don't know.

229
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:39,775
You know, I'd like
to believe you, Mike.

230
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:42,845
but, um...
here's the thing.

231
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:44,480
You ever see those
detective shows where,

232
00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:47,116
whenever somebody lies, they
dart their eyes to the side?

233
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:50,453
That's a real thing?
Oh, yeah.

234
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:54,457
So if there's anything that
you forgot to tell the police,

235
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,325
I need you to tell me.

236
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,464
Mike.

237
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,499
Evan could be
in serious danger.

238
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:06,068
He's not.

239
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,037
He's just hiding out
somewhere.

240
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:10,640
Evan is always
pulling crap like this.

241
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:12,308
It's just a prank.

242
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,578
Okay, so what happened to Shawn,
that's just a prank, too?

243
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,418
They, um, they were going to
the old Meadows place,

244
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,853
out on Night Hawk Drive.

245
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:25,354
Okay. How come?

246
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:27,657
Evan dared us to go, and...

247
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,993
it was stupid and creepy,
and I didn't...

248
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:36,365
I-I got scared.

249
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:39,669
But Evan, Shawn...

250
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:42,405
they're gonna be okay, right?

251
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:55,654
Hangover raid on the
continental breakfast?

252
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:57,004
Shh.

253
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:59,939
What?

254
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:02,242
First of all,
it's complimentary.

255
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:04,744
Second of all, what happened
to being nice to me?

256
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:11,751
You are forgiven.

257
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:16,323
So I talked to
the other friend -- uh, Mike.

258
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:17,957
And I think I got something.

259
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:21,561
Look at this.
Meet Dr. Avery Meadows.

260
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,330
He worked here back in
the early '60s.

261
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:25,632
Uh, people would come to him
for help with mental illness.

262
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:28,835
But no matter what the had --
depression, anxiety, whatever --

263
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:30,303
the cure was always the same.

264
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:33,239
He lobotomized them.

265
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,108
Mm. Fun.

266
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,912
Yeah. Those that lived,
he kept as “patients.”

267
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,848
And he would experiment
on them in his house,

268
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,249
which is exactly where

269
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:47,120
Evan and Shawn
were heading that night.

270
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:50,223
That's where Shawn got freaked
out and where Evan went missing?

271
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:52,359
Worth a shot.
I mean, when people found out

272
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,327
what Meadows was doing,
he was tried and executed.

273
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,030
But who knows? You know,
maybe he made a demon deal.

274
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:59,366
Or maybe he wasn't even human
to begin with.

275
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:05,505
This here? That's what Shawn
was drawing over and over.

276
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:07,640
Really?
Yeah.

277
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:09,976
What's up with
the creep-ass mask?

278
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:12,746
It's a plague mask.
Doctors used to use them.

279
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,681
They thought
they filtered out disease.

280
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:16,950
As a matter of fact,
when they arrested Meadows,

281
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,418
he was wearing one.

282
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,086
They had to hold him down
to rip it off.

283
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:27,193
Oh, man.

284
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:28,895
Hello?

285
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:31,331
Penny. What happened?

286
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,967
I don't know.

287
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:39,172
Shawn had a bad dream.

288
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:42,175
I checked on him. I...

289
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:44,944
It seemed -- seemed like
he was getting better.

290
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:46,679
I went back to my room,

291
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:49,682
but it got a little cold,
so I thought

292
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:52,585
Shawn must have opened a window.

293
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:56,256
But when I came back in
to close it,

294
00:17:56,258 --> 00:18:00,593
he was just...gone.

295
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:06,433
?

296
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,735
This is on me, man.
I saw how messed up Shawn was.

297
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,236
I should've pushed him
harder.

298
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:12,138
We don't know he's dead,
all right.

299
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,974
Penny said it got cold,
so could be a ghost.

300
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:16,609
Yeah, but what's a ghost doing,
showing up at a kid's place?

301
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:19,279
It's not like Shawn was
dragging a body around.

302
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:20,947
According to the reports,
Meadows was cremated.

303
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:24,617
So maybe his spirit is tied
to something else, an object...

304
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,453
So, what, Shawn took something
from the house?

305
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,455
It's possible.

306
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:30,190
All right,
where's the kid now?

307
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,026
Well, Meadows “treated”
the victims at his house.

308
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,928
So if this is him,

309
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,298
maybe that's where
he took Shawn.

310
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:50,109
?

311
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:07,560
Shawn?

312
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:12,966
?

313
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:15,368
Shawn, you in here?

314
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,271
Oh, dude.

315
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:20,974
Check this out.
Definitely a ghost.

316
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:22,442
Sam.

317
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,646
What's up, Doc?

318
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:31,818
?

319
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,987
Uhh!

320
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:48,871
Thanks.

321
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:51,073
Yeah.

322
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:56,612
?

323
00:19:56,881 --> 00:20:06,121
?

324
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,789
Shawn?

325
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:20,435
?

326
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:29,745
?

327
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:31,413
The mask.

328
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,015
You said they practically had to
tear it off of him, right?

329
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:34,416
Yeah.

330
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:36,952
So if he's tied to
something...

331
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:42,925
I'm gonna take that
as a “yes.”

332
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:46,195
Door. Salt. Burn 'em!

333
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:47,796
All of 'em?
Yeah!

334
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:56,471
?

335
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:12,654
- No.
- We ain't got much time.

336
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,827
Hurry!

337
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,076
You good?

338
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:35,844
Yeah, I'm good.

339
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:37,946
Let's go find Shawn.

340
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:39,581
Yeah.

341
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:49,157
?

342
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:51,226
Dean? Wait.

343
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:53,962
I can still see your breath.

344
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:55,597
What the hell, dude?

345
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,200
I think it might be
another ghost.

346
00:21:58,202 --> 00:22:00,402
I think there's a lot.

347
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,040
Let's go! Go!

348
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:08,410
<i>We need</i>
<i>a doctor! We need a doctor!</i>

349
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,579
<i>Where's the doctor?</i>
They're asking for the doc.

350
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,147
These must be
the people he killed.

351
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:14,216
Well, if they're ghosts,
then why can't we see them?

352
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:16,551
Maybe they're not strong enough
to pierce the Veil.

353
00:22:20,024 --> 00:22:21,100
Yeah, but they're strong enough
to kill us?!

354
00:22:21,124 --> 00:22:22,244
Great.
You know what?

355
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:24,827
Those bodies have gotta be buried
in the house somewhere.

356
00:22:24,828 --> 00:22:26,361
Okay, so we check it,
top to bottom.

357
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:27,996
There's no time.
What are you doing?

358
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:30,265
I'm gonna find out where
these bodies are buried.

359
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,501
So?
So I'm gonna ask 'em.

360
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:34,102
What? How?

361
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,038
Easy.

362
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,472
One needle stops the heart,

363
00:22:37,474 --> 00:22:39,708
the other one
starts it up again.

364
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,193
No, no, no.

365
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:42,011
Look, we can't talk to 'em
on this side of the Veil,

366
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:43,612
so I'm gonna go
to the other side.

367
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:45,213
I'm gonna work my way through
all these Caspers

368
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:46,882
until we find out where
this freak hid the bodies.

369
00:22:46,884 --> 00:22:48,383
Dean, you're talking about
killing yourself.

370
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:50,686
Yeah? Well, it worked before.

371
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:52,020
That's an insane risk
to take.

372
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:54,890
Listen, I need three minutes.
Okay?

373
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:57,159
D-don't even...Dean!

374
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:58,760
?

375
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:00,262
Dean?

376
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:02,731
Aah!
Hey.

377
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,099
Damn it.

378
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:05,701
Hey, hey, hey.

379
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:13,208
Dean? Dean!

380
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,546
?

381
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:21,450
Hey! Ghost dude!

382
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:22,818
Hey, hey, hey.

383
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,419
Hey, wait up, pal.

384
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:27,389
Hello,
my name is Jessica

385
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:28,890
and I'm here to lead you
to your next life.

386
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:32,027
Yeah, hi. Dean.
Little busy right now. Yo!

387
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:36,198
Oh, God.

388
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:43,338
?

389
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:47,809
?

390
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:53,782
Dean Winchester is
in the Veil!

391
00:23:53,784 --> 00:24:04,025
?

392
00:24:04,294 --> 00:24:06,928
?

393
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:15,637
Come on, Dean.
Come on.

394
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:20,542
Hey.

395
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:23,645
Hey. Wait up.

396
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:25,747
Hey. Hey, do you, uh...

397
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:30,051
Oh, come on.

398
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:32,020
I know you.

399
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:35,357
Shawn.

400
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,026
You're the FBI man
from my house.

401
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:40,729
You're dead, too?

402
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,899
I, uh...

403
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:46,501
Yeah.

404
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:48,203
What happened to you?

405
00:24:50,674 --> 00:24:52,541
The man with the drill.

406
00:24:54,478 --> 00:24:57,679
He was in my room.

407
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:12,861
?

408
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:22,437
?

409
00:25:22,706 --> 00:25:31,646
?

410
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:38,353
?

411
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:42,557
The Doc -- he possessed
you and he killed you.

412
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,759
I-I-I couldn't stop him.

413
00:25:44,761 --> 00:25:47,562
He said I'd feel better,
but...

414
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:49,064
I just...

415
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:51,666
I miss my mom.

416
00:25:56,406 --> 00:25:58,173
Shawn, I should've...

417
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:01,409
I'm so sorry.

418
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:05,080
Evan's here, too.

419
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:06,615
We can't leave.

420
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:08,550
We...

421
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:10,785
Why can't we leave?

422
00:26:14,057 --> 00:26:16,157
Stupid.

423
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,498
I know you're scared, okay?

424
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,567
But I'm gonna help you.

425
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:28,003
I'm gonna help you
get out of here.

426
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:29,871
Help me get home?

427
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:34,809
Help you go
to a better place.

428
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:36,912
But I need you to tell me...

429
00:26:36,914 --> 00:26:40,615
The doc, where did he put
your body?

430
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:45,453
Sam? Sam, I got it!

431
00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:48,623
Let's do this.

432
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:54,729
All right.

433
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,837
Come on, come on,
come on.

434
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,272
Dean.

435
00:27:05,943 --> 00:27:07,742
Dean?

436
00:27:07,744 --> 00:27:09,811
Hey! Dean!

437
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:12,414
Why is it not working?
No, no. No, no, no, no.

438
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:13,882
Dean!

439
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:16,751
Hey. Can you hear me?

440
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:18,219
Dean.

441
00:27:19,489 --> 00:27:20,956
Dean!

442
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:23,291
Dean! Hey, wake up.

443
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:25,126
Hey, Dean.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

444
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:28,830
Hey! Hey, Dean. Wake up.

445
00:27:28,832 --> 00:27:30,498
Billie.

446
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,934
We need to talk.

447
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:36,566
Hey. Hey! Wake up, Dean.

448
00:27:36,568 --> 00:27:38,935
And...
Wake up.

449
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:40,736
That's enough of that.
Hey!

450
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:49,245
No, I saw Cass kill you.

451
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:52,915
How's that working out
for him?

452
00:27:54,352 --> 00:27:56,953
It's funny
to hear a Winchester

453
00:27:56,955 --> 00:28:00,189
talk about
the finality of dying.

454
00:28:00,191 --> 00:28:04,427
This reality --
it has rules, Dean.

455
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,063
So many rules.

456
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:09,098
And one of them?

457
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,102
Kill one incarnation of Death,
like you did,

458
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:17,807
the next Reaper to die
takes his place.

459
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:20,910
So...

460
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:25,982
when Castiel stabbed me
in the back,

461
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,351
turns out...

462
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,987
I got a promotion.

463
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:34,790
New job. New gear.

464
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:38,127
So you died
to become Death?

465
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:41,230
This universe can be
so many things,

466
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:46,035
and sometimes, it is poetic.

467
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:48,704
That's why we need to talk.

468
00:28:50,441 --> 00:28:54,310
?

469
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:56,812
The hell?

470
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:03,152
Welcome to my reading room.

471
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:05,855
?

472
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:10,126
Know not to leave this lying
around near you. Don't we?

473
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:13,562
So...am I dead?

474
00:29:13,564 --> 00:29:15,731
You killed yourself.

475
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:18,034
No.

476
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:19,735
Are you keeping me dead?

477
00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:22,371
Now that depends on you.

478
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:27,343
Okay. Uh...

479
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:29,945
Well, congrats
on the promotion.

480
00:29:29,947 --> 00:29:32,248
Uh, but I got a house
full of ghosts waiting on me

481
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,850
and my brother to get back to,
so if it's up to me --

482
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:37,153
I didn't say it was
up to you.

483
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:39,388
I said it <i>depends</i> on you.

484
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,324
Word on
the interdimensional street

485
00:29:41,326 --> 00:29:43,726
is you've been slipping
between worlds, Dean.

486
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:48,297
I wanna know how you did it.
<i>Now.</i>

487
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,733
Well, I thought Death
knew everything.

488
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:54,136
Then you can imagine how
this one little blind spot

489
00:29:54,138 --> 00:29:57,239
is <i>really</i> bothering me.

490
00:29:58,876 --> 00:30:00,476
What's in it for me?

491
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:05,081
What do you want?

492
00:30:07,418 --> 00:30:10,353
Free the ghosts.
Excuse me?

493
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:13,522
Free the ghosts
at the Meadows house.

494
00:30:13,524 --> 00:30:17,560
Let them move on, I'll tell you
whatever you wanna know.

495
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:21,230
Deal.

496
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:25,968
?

497
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,804
Come with me.

498
00:30:28,806 --> 00:30:31,741
You don't have to stay here.

499
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:35,578
It's going to be okay.

500
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:52,094
?

501
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:53,629
It's done.

502
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:56,399
How do I know I can
trust you?

503
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:58,334
You don't.

504
00:30:58,336 --> 00:31:01,203
But then again, I'm not the one
breaking cosmic bargains

505
00:31:01,205 --> 00:31:02,772
left and right, now, am I?

506
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:05,808
Yeah, it's not
like you hold a grudge.

507
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,210
Don't I?

508
00:31:08,212 --> 00:31:11,547
So...spill.

509
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:16,952
Lucifer's son. Jack.

510
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:19,388
When he was born,
it created a little rip.

511
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,991
“A little rip”?
Mm.

512
00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:25,327
Into another world?

513
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:27,329
And you went there?

514
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:29,265
Mm.

515
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:32,535
Yeah, I'll just say it's, uh,
it's not Candy Land.

516
00:31:32,537 --> 00:31:33,936
I'll bet.

517
00:31:33,938 --> 00:31:35,337
Why do you care?

518
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:37,306
Because I do.

519
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,143
Because...

520
00:31:41,145 --> 00:31:45,548
this whole multi-versal
quantum construct we live in,

521
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,283
it's like a house of cards.

522
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:49,385
And the last thing I need

523
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:52,021
is some big, dumb Winchester

524
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:54,890
knocking it all down.

525
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:58,060
Hmm.

526
00:31:58,062 --> 00:32:00,262
That does sound like us.

527
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:05,234
You've changed.

528
00:32:07,171 --> 00:32:08,804
When you bargained with me
just now,

529
00:32:08,806 --> 00:32:12,041
you could've asked
to go back, to live.

530
00:32:12,043 --> 00:32:13,843
Well, I figure
with you in charge,

531
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:16,946
there's no getting back
for me.

532
00:32:16,948 --> 00:32:20,816
That doesn't sound like
the Dean Winchester I know and love.

533
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:23,285
The man who's been dead
so many times

534
00:32:23,287 --> 00:32:25,588
but it never seemed
to stick.

535
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,458
Maybe you're not that guy
anymore,

536
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,660
the guy
who saves the world,

537
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:33,929
the guy who always thinks
he'll win

538
00:32:33,931 --> 00:32:36,098
no matter what.

539
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:42,705
You <i>have</i> changed.

540
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:46,542
And you tell people
it's not a big deal.

541
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:48,978
You tell people
you'll work through it,

542
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,182
but you know you won't,
you can't,

543
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:55,851
and that scares the hell
out of you.

544
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:59,221
Or...am I wrong?

545
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:04,260
What do you want me to say?

546
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:06,262
Doesn't matter.

547
00:33:07,498 --> 00:33:10,633
<i>I</i> don't matter.
Don't you?

548
00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:16,138
I couldn't save Mom.
I couldn't save Cass.

549
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,141
I can't even save
a scared little kid.

550
00:33:19,143 --> 00:33:21,176
Sam keeps trying to fix it,

551
00:33:21,178 --> 00:33:23,913
but I just keep
dragging him down.

552
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:27,716
So I'm not gonna beg.

553
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:29,985
Okay, if it's my time,
it's my time.

554
00:33:29,987 --> 00:33:32,354
You really believe that.

555
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,793
You <i>wanna</i> die.

556
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,630
Dean...

557
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:45,067
every notebook
on this particular shelf

558
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:47,636
tells a version of
how you die.

559
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:50,039
You specifically --

560
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:52,241
heart attack,

561
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:56,011
burned by
a red-haired witch,

562
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:58,547
stabbed by a ghoul
in a graveyard,

563
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:01,317
and on and on.

564
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:07,323
?

565
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:09,959
But which one's right?

566
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:12,261
That depends on you,

567
00:34:12,263 --> 00:34:15,030
on the choices <i>you make.</i>

568
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:20,336
Well, I guess I made
my choice.

569
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,505
But...

570
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:25,341
unfortunately,

571
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:28,077
none of these books say
you die today.

572
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:31,213
Come again?

573
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:37,286
Since I got this...
new job,

574
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:41,557
I stand witness to
a much larger picture.

575
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:45,527
Do you know what I see?

576
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:47,496
You.

577
00:34:47,498 --> 00:34:50,633
And your brother.

578
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:52,835
You're important.

579
00:34:54,138 --> 00:34:55,571
Why?

580
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:57,940
You have work to do.

581
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:04,413
That's all you need to know.

582
00:35:04,415 --> 00:35:06,248
And trust me,

583
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,218
having my eyes opened to
the necessity of any humans,

584
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,154
especially Winchesters,

585
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:13,789
is not a thrill.

586
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:18,994
So...you wanna die,

587
00:35:18,996 --> 00:35:21,430
but I say...

588
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:23,065
keep living.

589
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:27,236
Hmm.

590
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:29,071
?

591
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:31,640
I need to know. My mom --

592
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,580
Hey. You're okay.

593
00:35:38,582 --> 00:35:40,115
Yeah.
Yeah.

594
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:44,853
You're okay.

595
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:07,051
How'd it go?

596
00:36:07,053 --> 00:36:10,721
About how you'd figure.

597
00:36:10,723 --> 00:36:13,624
Hey, what happened
back there?

598
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:15,526
I mean,
the shot didn't work

599
00:36:15,528 --> 00:36:17,628
and all of a sudden,
you're back.

600
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,432
I don't know. I guess it took a minute
for the drug to kick in.

601
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:22,900
I guess I got lucky.

602
00:36:22,902 --> 00:36:24,669
Lucky?
Yeah.

603
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:26,604
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
Hold -- Dean. Hold on a second.

604
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:28,005
What about the ghosts?

605
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:30,508
'Cause I checked the EMF.
They're all gone.

606
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,310
Was that lucky, too?

607
00:36:32,312 --> 00:36:33,811
We can talk about it later.

608
00:36:33,813 --> 00:36:36,113
We <i>won't</i> talk about it later.
You know that.

609
00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:47,058
I saw Death.

610
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,526
<i>The</i> Death.

611
00:36:48,528 --> 00:36:51,762
He's dead.

612
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:55,366
No, <i>she's</i> not.

613
00:36:55,368 --> 00:36:57,201
It's Billie.

614
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:59,470
I guess she got a new gig.

615
00:36:59,472 --> 00:37:02,139
She's the one that
took care of the ghosts.

616
00:37:02,141 --> 00:37:05,276
W-why would she help us?

617
00:37:05,278 --> 00:37:07,011
She wanted Intel.

618
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:09,814
She said that we're important,
that we have work to do.

619
00:37:09,816 --> 00:37:11,349
What the hell
does that mean?

620
00:37:11,351 --> 00:37:13,417
I have no friggin' clue.

621
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:22,960
?

622
00:37:22,962 --> 00:37:24,829
You okay?

623
00:37:24,831 --> 00:37:27,098
No.

624
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,768
Sam, I'm not okay.
I'm pretty far from okay.

625
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:38,109
You know, my whole life,

626
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:43,014
I always believed that
what we do was important.

627
00:37:43,016 --> 00:37:46,050
No matter what the cost,
no matter who we lost,

628
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:50,421
whether it was Dad or --
or Bobby or...

629
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:52,890
And I would take the hit.

630
00:37:52,892 --> 00:37:57,361
But I kept on fighting
because I believed

631
00:37:57,363 --> 00:38:02,199
that we were making the world
a better place.

632
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:05,736
And now Mom and Cass...

633
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:07,938
And I-I don't know.

634
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,541
I don't know.

635
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:13,044
So now you don't
believe anymore.

636
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,480
I just need a win.

637
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:20,551
I just need a damn win.

638
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:26,991
?

639
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:48,946
?

640
00:38:48,948 --> 00:38:52,616
? Your eyes are moist,
you scream and shout ?

641
00:38:52,618 --> 00:38:55,286
? As though you were
a man possessed ?

642
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:58,689
? From deep inside
comes rushing forth ?

643
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:01,459
? All the anguish
you suppressed ?

644
00:39:01,461 --> 00:39:04,295
? Upon your wall
hangs your degree ?

645
00:39:04,297 --> 00:39:07,431
? Your parents craved
so much for you ?

646
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:10,501
? And though you're trained
to make your mark ?

647
00:39:10,503 --> 00:39:13,671
? You still don't quite know
what to do ?

648
00:39:13,673 --> 00:39:18,342
? It's never too late
to start all over again ?

649
00:39:19,645 --> 00:39:22,513
? To love the people
you caused the pain ?

650
00:39:22,515 --> 00:39:26,417
? And help them
learn your name ?

651
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:31,355
? Oh, no, not too late ?

652
00:39:31,357 --> 00:39:36,327
? It's never too late
to start all over again ?

653
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,197
? You say you've only got
one life to live ?

654
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:43,300
? And when you're dead
you're gone ?

655
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:49,540
Yeah.

656
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:52,176
? “You left us alone” ?

657
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:56,847
What?

658
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:07,091
?

659
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:16,867
?

660
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:20,237
? Tell me who's to say
after all is done ?

661
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,207
? And you're finally gone,
you won't be back again ?

662
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:27,111
? You can find a way
to change today ?

663
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:29,713
? You don't have to wait
till then ?

664
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:35,653
? It's never too late
to start all over again ?

665
00:40:35,655 --> 00:40:42,993
?
