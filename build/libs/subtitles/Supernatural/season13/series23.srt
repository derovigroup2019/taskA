1
00:00:00,503 --> 00:00:03,919
My name is Dean Winchester.
That big fella's my brother Sam.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,688
- We kill monsters.
- Oh, this is boring.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,890
Is there...
I don't know, music?

4
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:12,623
? Carry on, my wayward son ?

5
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:16,761
? There'll be peace
when you are done ?

6
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:20,831
? Lay your weary head to rest ?

7
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,634
? Don't you cry no more ?

8
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:28,799
We've got portals
to apocalyptic worlds.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,634
We've got
shape-shifting demons.

10
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:34,203
Dealing with a whole new set
of tiddlywinks.

11
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:36,472
So much for simple.

12
00:00:36,474 --> 00:00:38,474
Your mother, she's alive.

13
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:41,477
We're gonna save
Jack and Mom, together.

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,912
? Once I rose above ?

15
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:45,648
? The noise and confusion ?
Bobby.

16
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,452
? Just to get a glimpse
beyond this illusion ?

17
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:51,954
Michael wants to come
to Earth and destroy it,

18
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:53,722
- and we need your help.
- Let's go.

19
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:55,124
? But I flew too high ?

20
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:56,926
- Welcome to the team.
- Hmm, hmm.

21
00:00:56,928 --> 00:01:00,763
? Though my eyes could see,
I still was a blind man ?

22
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:02,798
We grab Satan
and we use his grace

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,967
to open up a door
between two universes.

24
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:08,070
Then we get Mom, we get Jack,
and we get out.

25
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:09,505
Team Free Will 2.0.

26
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:12,141
Here we go.
? I can hear them say ?

27
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:15,478
? Carry on, my wayward son ?

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,746
We're running out of time.
Let's pick up the pace.

29
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:19,315
? When you are done ?

30
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:22,184
Aah!
? Lay your weary head to rest ?

31
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:23,719
No!

32
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:25,721
? Don't you cry no more ?

33
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:27,289
That was awesome.

34
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:33,629
The ice caps are melting.
People marching.

35
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:37,900
A little bit of, uh,
craziness in the movie world.

36
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:41,504
Businessman billionaire mogul
turned President,

37
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:44,707
embroiled in yet another
controversy.

38
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,809
And that...
is pretty much the world --

39
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:49,445
uh, <i>our</i> world -- right now.

40
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:51,680
Let me get this right --

41
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:53,916
the ice caps are melting,

42
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:55,985
a movie where a girl

43
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:58,053
goes all the way
with a fish...

44
00:01:58,055 --> 00:01:59,955
wins Best Picture,

45
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:02,892
and that damn fool idjit
from “The Apprentice”,

46
00:02:02,894 --> 00:02:05,528
is President.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,331
And you call where <i>we</i> come
from “Apocalypse World”.

48
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,733
Good point.

49
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:12,401
Sorry.

50
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:14,036
Oh. Excuse me.

51
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:17,973
- Dean.
- <i>Hey, Sam. Got something.</i>

52
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:20,543
All right. I'm on my way.

53
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:24,246
All right,
gang's all here.

54
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:26,382
How many are inside?

55
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:29,685
I can hear three.
Wait, maybe -- maybe four.

56
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:32,321
They're talking about
whether Kylie Jenner

57
00:02:32,323 --> 00:02:35,391
would make a good mother.

58
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:37,393
The consensus is no.

59
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:39,862
Yeah, well, that's why
I'm a Khlo? man.

60
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:42,498
All right, we're talking
werewolves, which means...

61
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,999
Silver bullets.

62
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:45,334
That's right.

63
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:47,236
So...

64
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:48,671
you know the play.

65
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:50,239
Let's do it to it.

66
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:22,137
And <i>that...</i>

67
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,273
that is why
I'm a Khlo? man.

68
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:45,928
So you really like
the rain?

69
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,597
When it's
this beautiful, I do.

70
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:53,202
So what are you gonna
do now?

71
00:03:53,204 --> 00:03:55,537
Honestly, I got no clue.

72
00:03:55,539 --> 00:04:01,043
Everyone seems to be
settling in okay in town.

73
00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:03,212
Ketch is out doing
Ketch things.

74
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:05,414
Rowena and Charlie
are road tripping it

75
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,116
through the Southwest.

76
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:08,617
That's trouble.

77
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:12,521
Ginger trouble --
the worst kind.

78
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:15,624
Anyways...

79
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:20,729
without an archangel, it's not
like we can go back home.

80
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:24,600
And I'm not sure
I'd want to.

81
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:27,770
I...I like it here.

82
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:37,546
Is that...

83
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:39,148
Blood.

84
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:51,193
Maggie.

Yeah, no kidding.

89
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,476
I mean, he keeps this up,
and...

90
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:11,080
And what?

91
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:13,248
I don't know.

92
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,485
Hey, you remember...

93
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:19,254
remember when you asked

94
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:21,523
if we could stop it?

95
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:24,159
All the evil in the world?
Yeah.

96
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:27,763
If we could...
really change things?

97
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,765
Well, maybe with Jack,
we can.

98
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,567
Maybe you're right.

99
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,268
But then
what will we do?

100
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,771
Mm. Yeah.

101
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:37,973
This.

102
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:40,642
A whole lot of this.

103
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:44,213
But on a beach somewhere,
you know?

104
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:45,447
Can you imagine?

105
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,916
You, me, Cass,
toes in the sand,

106
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,952
couple of them
little umbrella drinks.

107
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:52,121
Matching Hawaiian shirts,
obviously.

108
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:54,857
Some hula girls.

109
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,759
You talking about retiring?

110
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:58,660
<i>You?</i>

111
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:01,396
If I knew the world was safe?

112
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:03,165
Hell, yeah.
And you know why?

113
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,667
'Cause we freaking
earned it, man.

114
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,973
- I'll drink to that.
- Yeah.

115
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,944
Hell, yeah.

116
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:18,947
Stop!

117
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:21,950
No!

118
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,123
Jack? Hey.

119
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:32,494
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Easy.

120
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:34,263
You're just having
a bad dream.

121
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:36,865
Sorry.

122
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:40,035
It's okay. You don't
have to apologize.

123
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:42,404
I have 'em, too. All the time.

124
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:44,573
You do?

125
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:47,042
Sure.

126
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:50,179
You, um...

127
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:51,680
What do you see?

128
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:54,183
Well, depends.

129
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,053
Mostly...

130
00:06:58,055 --> 00:07:00,556
mostly people I couldn't save.

131
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,125
Me, too.

132
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:06,562
Over there
in the other world,

133
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:10,699
I said I'd protect
those people.

134
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:12,467
But...

135
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:15,304
I saw so many of them die.

136
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:20,242
And...I tried to save them.

137
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:23,378
I...I tried,

138
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,880
but...

139
00:07:24,882 --> 00:07:26,882
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

140
00:07:33,457 --> 00:07:35,724
I wasn't strong enough.

141
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:41,263
Jack...

142
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:47,903
it's not about being strong.

143
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:49,304
I mean...

144
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:55,377
Look, I don't know
what you saw over there

145
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,379
and I don't know
what you went through.

146
00:07:57,381 --> 00:08:00,415
I know it was bad.

147
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:03,685
But I also know that
you came out the other side

148
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:05,587
because you <i>are</i> strong.

149
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:08,857
But even when we're strong,

150
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:11,293
man, things are gonna
happen.

151
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:13,795
We're gonna make mistakes.

152
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:17,733
Nobody's perfect. Right?

153
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:19,368
But we can get better.

154
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,337
Every day,
we can get better.

155
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:29,244
So whatever you're dealing with,
you know, whatever...

156
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:31,747
whatever comes at us,

157
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:35,217
we'll figure out a way
to deal with it, together.

158
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:41,256
You're family, kid,

159
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,792
and we look after our own.

160
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:48,497
Dean?

161
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:54,670
What's wrong?

162
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:04,913
I-I...

163
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:07,783
I said I'd protect her,
and, Sam...

164
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,685
Stop, Jack.

165
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:13,021
This isn't your fault.

166
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:15,490
What happened to her?

167
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,426
I don't know.

168
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:19,361
Doesn't look supernatural.

169
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:22,197
Looks like some son of a bitch
beat on her until...

170
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:24,633
Who would do
something like this?

171
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:37,045
Word is, you're friends
with Maggie.

172
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:39,881
Uh, yeah, since we came over.

173
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,484
Me and her,
we didn't have anybody else,

174
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:44,720
so we kinda stuck together.

175
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:47,055
So I'm sure you know
she went out last night.

176
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:50,392
Well, she didn't come home.

177
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:52,394
Um...

178
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:54,062
is Maggie in trouble?

179
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,333
She's dead.

180
00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:04,039
She...

181
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,442
No, that's not...

182
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:09,211
We were supposed
to be safe here.

183
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,947
We need to know
where Maggie went,

184
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:13,682
who she was talking to.

185
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:16,351
I don't...

186
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:20,689
There was a boy.

187
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:22,557
What boy?

188
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,159
Nate.

189
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:26,928
He works at that store
out on Route 281.

190
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,632
Maggie, she had a crush.

191
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:32,934
That's why she snuck out
last night.

192
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:34,436
She was going to meet him.

193
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:37,072
All right, well, let's go talk
to this boy, Jack.

194
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,676
Jack?

195
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:06,268
Why'd you do it?!

196
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,303
Tell me!

197
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:10,205
I-I didn't.
Liar!

198
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,441
Jack! No!

199
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,278
Jack?

200
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,450
- Let him go.
- All right.

201
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:23,418
Jack!

202
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,858
You...you shot me.

203
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,360
To get your attention.
You're acting like a psycho!

204
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:36,598
- Jack.
- He killed Maggie.

205
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,266
Maggie?

206
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:41,536
Maggie's dead?

207
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:44,639
Jack, listen to me.

208
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,441
He didn't kill Maggie.

209
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:49,144
Look at him.

210
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:57,452
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:57,454 --> 00:11:58,887
Jack!

212
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,388
No, hey, just --
just let him go.

213
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:07,762
You keep <i>hurting</i> people!

214
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:13,635
You keep...

215
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:16,071
<i>Aah! Uhh!</i>

216
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:17,372
hurting...

217
00:12:19,109 --> 00:12:20,709
<i>Aah!</i>

218
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:24,513
Why do you keep hurting people?!

219
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:34,990
You shot him.

220
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:37,492
Uh...rubber bullets.

221
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:39,361
Yeah,
a training exercise.

222
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:41,062
We're FBI.
I'm Agent Rowland.

223
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:43,899
This is Agent Knowles
and Agent Williams.

224
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:48,837
You need to go. <i>Now.</i>

225
00:13:13,497 --> 00:13:15,163
Hi, son.

226
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:37,015
Run!

227
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,520
Aah!

228
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
- It's not possible.
- Yeah, tell him that.

229
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,632
Hey, fellas.

230
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:56,919
Miss me?

231
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:03,195
No, no, no, Cass. Don't!

232
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:07,466
No, Cass. Do. Please.

233
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:18,877
Run!

234
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:22,247
Go, go, go, go!

235
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:39,866
Is this...

236
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:42,135
Are you real?

237
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:43,665
Always.

238
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,433
Sam said you're dead.

239
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:47,668
He said
Michael killed you.

240
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,871
Yeah, I don't like
to speak ill of people,

241
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:51,906
but Sam is a big fat liar

242
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:54,742
and he's a bad person
and...

243
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:56,377
like, freakishly tall, so...

244
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,613
I-I don't understand.

245
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:01,282
No, Michael didn't...

246
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:03,951
Sam was the one
who left me behind.

247
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:06,053
- What?
- Yep.

248
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,955
I mean, I think he thought
I'd be trapped over there

249
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:09,624
in “Giant Litter Box World”
forever,

250
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:11,893
'cause that worked so well
the first time.

251
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:14,529
I don't blame him,
though, okay?

252
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:16,964
I mean...

253
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,699
for everything that
I've done to him, I think, uh,

254
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:21,235
I had it coming, you know?

255
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:23,804
But you know what?

256
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,673
I'm moving on.

257
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:30,344
But if the rift is closed,
then how are you here?

258
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,080
Oh, no. Not “how.”

259
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:35,049
“Why.”

260
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:37,518
I'm here for <i>you,</i> Jack.

261
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,155
Because, you know, even though
the Three Amigos --

262
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,557
Sam, Dean,
and the other one --

263
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,284
won't admit it,
<i>you</i> need <i>me.</i>

264
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,308
You do,
'cause we're blood.

265
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:50,360
And we're not human, no matter
how much we pretend to be.

266
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:53,413
See, humans are...

267
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,384
limited and fragile.

268
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:59,108
And I'll admit, they bring out
the worst in me, I gotta say.

269
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,968
It seems like, you know,
no matter how much

270
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:03,903
you try to do right around them,
something always goes wrong.

271
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:05,165
Follow?

272
00:16:05,822 --> 00:16:08,322
I...

273
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:09,957
I know.

274
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,827
Right? And that's not
their fault, or ours.

275
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:17,365
It's just, us and humans,
we're like oil and water.

276
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,799
You know, sardines
and strawberries.

277
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:21,736
It's just
a bad combination.

278
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:25,506
What do we do?

279
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,276
Leave.

280
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:33,147
I mean...

281
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:36,550
there's a whole universe
out there, buddy.

282
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:40,654
Planets. Stars. Galaxies.

283
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:42,790
Why should we stay here
on Earth

284
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,693
when we can
go anywhere else?

285
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:48,929
Heck, everywhere else.

286
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:52,600
Like, um,
like "Star Wars"?

287
00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:55,236
Exactly like "Star Wars."

288
00:16:56,672 --> 00:17:00,074
You want a lightsaber?

289
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,276
I can make you a lightsaber.

290
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:04,044
Heck, I can make you
a Wookiee.

291
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:05,913
But...no.

292
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,849
Sam, Dean, and Castiel,

293
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:11,152
they'll miss me.

294
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:13,220
Yes, they will.

295
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:15,122
They will. It'll be hard.

296
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:18,559
But you have to
live your life for you.

297
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:20,661
Right?

298
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:23,364
This is our second chance,
kiddo.

299
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:26,000
This is our opportunity

300
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:31,238
to escape our past
and our sins

301
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,108
and start over.

302
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,911
What do you say?

303
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:38,846
Father, son.

304
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:41,582
You up for
an adventure, buddy?

305
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,884
I...

306
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:48,189
I'd like that.

307
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:53,461
But there's something
you need to do first.

308
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:55,529
Talked to the other refugees.

309
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:58,399
No one's got any idea
who'd wanna hurt Maggie.

310
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:00,801
Maybe it wasn't
one of them.

311
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:02,970
Maybe...

312
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:07,641
there are monsters in this world
that aren't monsters.

313
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,247
Jack! Hey --

314
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:14,949
Hey.

315
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:16,517
Kid, what the Sam Hell?

316
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,352
It's all right, okay?
He's here to help.

317
00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:21,388
- He is?
- You know it, Longmire.

318
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,061
Call Sam. Now.

319
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:35,035
Hmm.

320
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:39,206
So you're leaving dead bodies
on tables now.

321
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,641
Nice.

322
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:42,877
We were waiting,

323
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:45,045
to give her
a Hunter's funeral.

324
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:46,947
You won't have to.

325
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:51,185
My father, he's gonna
bring Maggie back to life.

326
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:52,887
I am?

327
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:59,059
Yeah, boys, we got a problem.

328
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:03,330
Jack, what are you doing?

329
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:06,100
What I have to.

330
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:09,270
This...

331
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:12,039
it's my second chance.

332
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:16,176
Yeah, uh, Jack, about this, uh,
resurrection stuff --

333
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:19,179
It's not always a great idea
because, uh...

334
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:23,017
you know,
people come back...different.

335
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:24,852
Well, Sam didn't.

336
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:27,688
Right. Well, Sam's always
been...

337
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,156
sort of different.
You know what I mean?

338
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:32,159
Some would say "special."

339
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:34,828
No offense.

340
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,497
You said you'd do anything.

341
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:46,340
Fine.

342
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:49,076
Fine.

343
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:55,382
Has he done
something to you?

344
00:19:55,384 --> 00:19:58,052
I heard that. Heard it.

345
00:19:58,054 --> 00:20:02,723
Mary, everything's
gonna be fine.

346
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:04,525
Okay.

347
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:15,569
Jack?

348
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:16,837
Jack!

349
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:20,240
He's not...

350
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:21,675
He's gone.

351
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:28,151
How did Michael and Lucifer
both get here?

352
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,953
How did they open a rift?
You know what? It doesn't --

353
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:32,737
We -- we've gotta find Jack
before Michael does

354
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:34,371
whatever the hell
he's gonna do, okay?

355
00:20:34,373 --> 00:20:35,973
I-I'll call Jody
and everybody else.

356
00:20:35,975 --> 00:20:38,809
You're gonna put out an APB
on the Devil?

357
00:20:38,811 --> 00:20:40,344
Yeah, I am.

358
00:20:41,814 --> 00:20:43,614
I'll check angel radio.

359
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:50,521
Sam, even if
we find Lucifer,

360
00:20:50,523 --> 00:20:51,989
how we gonna stop him?

361
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:01,899
Maggie? Hey, sorry.

362
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:03,334
You okay?

363
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:06,837
I'm alive, so...

364
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,305
yes?

365
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:10,941
Right.

366
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:15,613
Listen, I-I know this is
weird -- so...weird --

367
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:20,484
but, um,
before you...died,

368
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:24,221
do you remember anything about
the person that killed you?

369
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:26,790
Does it matter?

370
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:29,860
Kinda seems like you have
bigger, you know,

371
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:31,929
Satan-y problems.

372
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:34,531
Yeah, but -- but we're --
we're dealing with those.

373
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,234
Mostly. Um...

374
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:40,971
But yes, it does matter.
It matters to me.

375
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,142
I...

376
00:21:45,144 --> 00:21:47,778
I never saw his face,

377
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,981
but, uh...

378
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:53,651
I saw his eyes.

379
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:11,235
Magnificent, isn't it?

380
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:13,303
It really is.

381
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:17,207
All right, Jody's lookin'.
So far, Nada.

382
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:19,476
Yeah, angel radio
is nothing but static,

383
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:20,944
which is disturbing.

384
00:22:20,946 --> 00:22:23,313
Great. Well, we'll just
add that to the list.

385
00:22:23,315 --> 00:22:25,082
So what do we do now?

386
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:31,055
What's happening?

387
00:22:35,394 --> 00:22:37,227
What the hell?

388
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:41,765
Oh, no.

389
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,434
What the hell is that?

390
00:22:43,436 --> 00:22:45,569
Mom, Bobby, take Maggie,
get her out of here.

391
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:47,504
Go through the garage.
We'll buy you some time.

392
00:22:47,506 --> 00:22:49,840
No!

393
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:52,342
- Mom!
- Please!

394
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:54,611
- Go.
- Go.

395
00:23:36,455 --> 00:23:37,955
Aah!

396
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:43,127
You really thought
you could run from me?

397
00:23:50,536 --> 00:23:52,002
Aah! Uhh!

398
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:02,179
Yeah, how did you --
?Get here?

399
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:04,648
Easy. I made a deal.

400
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,151
I saw they do the spell.

401
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:08,418
I know what it takes.

402
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,521
It's some blood,
some fruit,

403
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:12,689
a glowy rock, and then...

404
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:15,859
Bam. We step through,
both of us.

405
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:19,730
And now,
this world is mine.

406
00:24:19,732 --> 00:24:22,232
I can save it,
purge it of sin.

407
00:24:22,234 --> 00:24:24,902
Oh, yeah, 'cause that
really worked on your rock.

408
00:24:24,904 --> 00:24:27,604
?I'm not perfect.
Yes, I made mistakes.

409
00:24:27,606 --> 00:24:30,240
But second time's the charm.

410
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:35,145
And you...
?Aah!

411
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:37,714
Dean Winchester, will be
the first life that I take

412
00:24:37,716 --> 00:24:40,651
in this world,
first soul I save.

413
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:44,721
Some would consider that
an honor.

414
00:24:44,723 --> 00:24:47,624
Well, as Shakespeare
once said,

415
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:49,927
eat me, dickbag.

416
00:24:51,397 --> 00:24:52,930
?

417
00:24:52,932 --> 00:24:54,932
Jack, Jack.

418
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,633
Jack, I don't know
where you are,

419
00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:58,936
and I don't even know
if you can hear this prayer,

420
00:24:58,938 --> 00:25:00,404
but we need you.

421
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,174
We need you.

422
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:08,178
Look at
all those worlds, Jack.

423
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,348
We're gonna take
the grand tour, buddy.

424
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,586
We're gonna explore every nook
and cranny of creation.

425
00:25:17,223 --> 00:25:19,957
We might even
learn something,

426
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:23,060
maybe come up
with some improvements.

427
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,296
Improvements?

428
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:29,900
Yeah, yeah. We'll --
we'll talk about that later.

429
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:35,205
Jack, Jack,
I don't know where you are,

430
00:25:35,207 --> 00:25:38,976
and I don't even know
if you can hear this prayer.

431
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:40,477
We need you.

432
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:47,017
What's up, buddy?

433
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:49,653
You all right?

434
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:55,259
Could've done this quick,
but I wanted to enjoy it,

435
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:58,562
that moment when the soul
leaves the body... ?

436
00:25:58,564 --> 00:26:00,998
it's beautiful.

437
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,936
Aah!

438
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,508
Jack.

439
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,577
I heard your prayer.

440
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:18,348
Yeah, it's me.
Yay!

441
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,984
Uh, we done, buddy?

442
00:26:26,191 --> 00:26:27,624
Buddy?

443
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:29,159
You hurt my friends.

444
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:33,897
You hurt my family!

445
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:37,434
Whoa.

446
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:45,709
Lucifer,
we -- we had a deal!

447
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:47,344
Okay, game over.

448
00:26:47,346 --> 00:26:49,279
Hey, buddy, let's, uh, let's, uh...

449
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:50,714
split, okay?

450
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:52,449
What does he mean?

451
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,821
I-I-I don't know.
I didn't -- I didn't hear.

452
00:26:57,823 --> 00:27:00,791
They had a deal.

453
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:02,459
Lucifer gets you,

454
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:05,529
and Michael
gets everything else.

455
00:27:05,531 --> 00:27:09,566
He's gonna nuke our world, Jack,
just like he did his.

456
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:13,170
- Is that true?
- ?No! It's not.

457
00:27:13,172 --> 00:27:16,039
Is that why
you wanted us to leave?

458
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:17,708
Leave?

459
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:23,347
He said -- he said
we'd go to the stars.

460
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:25,215
What,
and you're just gonna

461
00:27:25,217 --> 00:27:27,184
leave the rest of us
here to burn?

462
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:29,152
Okay. Hold on a second.

463
00:27:29,154 --> 00:27:32,856
Let's slow down, 'cause I...

464
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:35,125
I'm not currently
the bad guy here.

465
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:37,561
Yeah, tell that to Maggie.

466
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:39,162
What about Maggie?

467
00:27:39,164 --> 00:27:42,499
Maggie saw the eyes
of the person who killed her --

468
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:45,535
the glowing, red eyes.

469
00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:48,372
You're gonna --
you're gonna believe this guy?

470
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:51,441
- Come on, man! Sam's a hater!
-Tell me.

471
00:27:51,443 --> 00:27:53,310
He would say anything
to get you on his side.

472
00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:54,745
Tell me the truth!

473
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:01,151
She saw me when I was

474
00:28:01,153 --> 00:28:04,388
scouting out the bunker.

475
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,591
She saw me and she screamed,
and then...

476
00:28:07,593 --> 00:28:10,460
so I crushed her skull
with my bare hands.

477
00:28:10,462 --> 00:28:13,730
And it was warm and wet,
and I liked it.

478
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:26,443
You're not my father.

479
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:28,378
You're a monster.

480
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:33,984
Come on, man!

481
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:52,069
Okay.

482
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:53,603
I tried with you.

483
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:57,140
I really tried with you.

484
00:28:57,142 --> 00:28:59,443
Everything you told me
was a lie.

485
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:02,245
Because I told you what
you wanted to hear, man.

486
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:04,081
So what?! I killed the girl!
Big deal!

487
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,650
She's a -- she's a human!
She doesn't matter!

488
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:08,085
So am I!

489
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:09,586
Yeah?

490
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:11,922
And that's your problem.

491
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:13,924
You're too much like
your mother.

492
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,826
Jack...

493
00:29:15,828 --> 00:29:17,294
Stay back.

494
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:21,164
I'll handle him.

495
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:23,733
Will you?

496
00:29:23,735 --> 00:29:26,970
Oh, buddy.

497
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:29,673
We could've been something,
you and me.

498
00:29:29,675 --> 00:29:33,443
We could've remade the universe.
It would've been great.

499
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:37,314
We could've been
better gods than Dad.

500
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:40,050
And I really wanted that, pal.
I wanted that.

501
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:44,121
But now if I can't
have it with you, I...

502
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:45,522
I don't need ya.

503
00:29:47,593 --> 00:29:49,659
I just need your power.

504
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:51,862
?- Jack! - ?No!

505
00:30:01,273 --> 00:30:04,674
Ahh.

506
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:06,476
- Jack.
- Sammy!

507
00:30:06,478 --> 00:30:08,411
- Jack!
- ?

508
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,817
Sammy!

509
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,190
What just happened?

510
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,992
I don't know.

511
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,661
The Devil won.

512
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,299
That's what happened.

513
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,413
Really, Sam? Hitching a ride?

514
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,082
I mean, do you ever quit?

515
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,951
- Go to hell.
- ?Hell, yeah.

516
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,454
Been there. Done that.

517
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:58,922
?Aah!

518
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,325
How do we stop him?

519
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,828
You don't.

520
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:09,666
After consuming the nephilim's
grace, Lucifer's juiced up.

521
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:12,068
He's super-charged.

522
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,206
He'll kill the boy,
your brother.

523
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,674
Hell, he could
end the whole universe

524
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:20,276
if he put his mind to it.

525
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,212
And you thought I was bad.

526
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,081
No. No, you beat him. I saw you.

527
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,984
When he was weaker,
and I was stronger.

528
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,953
Believe me,

529
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:33,022
I'd love to rip
my brother apart.

530
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,426
But now in this banged up
meatsuit...

531
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:39,729
not happening.

532
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:45,835
This is the end,
of everything.

533
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,473
No.

534
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:55,478
What if...

535
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,647
what if you had your sword?

536
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,819
You know...
it's been real fun.

537
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,320
I really had a great time
with you,

538
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,656
but I think we should see
other people.

539
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,827
- What do you say?
- ?

540
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,531
Aah!
?

541
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,902
Stop!

542
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,406
Now why should I listen to you?

543
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,909
Because...

544
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,677
- I'm your son.
?- Oh, yeah.

545
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,512
Well, you had a chance
with that, but...

546
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,815
?Now?

547
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:38,721
As for kids...
Ah, I can make more of those.

548
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:46,029
Wow, Daddy Sammy
coming to the rescue.

549
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,533
But your little Jackie,

550
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,736
the nougat-loving boy
that you had before,

551
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,438
he's killed people.

552
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,274
He's got lots of blood
on his hands.

553
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,911
I don't care.

554
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,346
He's family.

555
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,682
Ha!

556
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:08,184
What's family done for anybody?

557
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,320
My dad left me.

558
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,389
My brothers tried to kill me.
A lot.

559
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,625
Family blows.

560
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,060
And I'm gonna prove it to you.

561
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:20,463
What, by killing me?
Go ahead.

562
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,766
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

563
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,101
He is.

564
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,448
Dean, no.

565
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,083
I am your sword.

566
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:43,486
It's you.
?You're the Michael sword.

567
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,655
Your perfect vessel.

568
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:49,058
Why do you think you two
are the vessels?

569
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,860
Michael

570
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,629
and Lucifer.

571
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,031
You were
born to this, boys.

572
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,838
With me, you'd be stronger
than you've ever been.

573
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,773
Oh, I know what you are.

574
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,775
If we work together,
can we beat Lucifer?

575
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,977
- Dean --
?- Can we?!

576
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:10,947
We'd have a chance.

577
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:14,617
Dean, you can't.

578
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,352
Lucifer has Sam.

579
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,820
He has Jack.

580
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,722
Cass, I don't have a choice!

581
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,293
If we do this,

582
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,995
it's a onetime deal.

583
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,097
I'm in charge.

584
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,500
You're the engine,
but I'm behind the wheel.

585
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,101
Understand?

586
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:40,009
Now I could -- I probably
should -- execute you.

587
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,679
I mean, really, really use
my imagination.

588
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,447
But I'm feeling generous today.

589
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,216
So one of you is gonna
walk out that door,

590
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,486
and the other one will be
laying dead on the ground.

591
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,689
You choose.

592
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,528
No.

593
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,096
Or you could do that,
and I can murder you both

594
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,765
and end all life
in the universe.

595
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:06,169
Remake it in my image,
better than Dad ever could.

596
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,870
I'm thinkin'...

597
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,039
mm...

598
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,241
fire-breathing dragons,

599
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,110
sassy talking robots.

600
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,412
I might give humans another
chance if they know their place

601
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,949
and worship me,
'cause I've earned it.

602
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,019
But hey, it'll probably take a few days to
unravel the universe,

603
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,021
Maybe, uh, 7, 10 days tops.

604
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:28,758
So maybe, just maybe,
one of you could stop me.

605
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,194
Maybe.

606
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,733
Well, let's see.
Clock's ticking, guys.

607
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,638
Kill me.

608
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,940
- What?
?- Kill me.

609
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:20,676
You can stop him, Jack.

610
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,311
You can get your power back.

611
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,081
No, I-I c-can't.
I can't beat him.

612
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,120
But you can.
?What?

613
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,890
I know you can.

614
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,492
No, no, no, no, no. Jack.

615
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,095
Don't! Jack!

616
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:40,563
Jack!

617
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:43,432
I love you.
I love all of you.

618
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,734
Jack, don't! Don't!

619
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,388
Dean?

620
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,326
Hiya, Sammy.

621
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,532
You let my brother in.

622
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,802
Well, turns out, he and I
have something in common.

623
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,838
We both wanna gut your ass.

624
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,310
Aah!

625
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,965
?

626
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,997
Well...
?Uhh!

627
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,532
Good try, Dean.
?I'll give you that, buddy.

628
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,838
I'm not just powerful now.

629
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,439
I am power.

630
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:34,110
And I don't need a blade
to end you, pal.

631
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:36,012
Dean!

632
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:38,147
Bye-bye, Dean.

633
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:38,177
Is he...

634
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,778
He...

635
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,281
he's dead.

636
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:45,317
Holy crap.

637
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:47,152
You did it.

638
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:54,360
No.

639
00:39:54,362 --> 00:39:56,328
No, we did it.

640
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,864
We did it.

641
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:06,538
Dean?

642
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:13,245
Dean!

643
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,714
We had a deal!

644
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:23,155
Michael.

645
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,433
Thanks for the suit.
