1
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,266
Aah!

2
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,441
Aah! Uh!

3
00:00:19,944 --> 00:00:22,578
Uhh!

4
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:27,783
Holy oil!

5
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:29,519
Okay, move!

6
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:42,064
Oh!
Pfft.

7
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:47,837
Whoa.

8
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:02,919
Is it over?

9
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:05,755
Yeah. Yes.
Uh, sorry about the mess.

10
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:07,590
You boys just took down
an evil plushie

11
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:10,192
that was trying to kill me.
We're all good.

12
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:11,861
Alan?

13
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,330
Everything okay in here?

14
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:17,567
- Oh, uh, hey, Jay.
- I heard the ruckus next door, and I...

15
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:19,902
What in the...What...

16
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:21,637
holy heck?

17
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:23,239
It -- it was a-a...

18
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:25,374
- Did they do this?
- No. Naw, it was a...

19
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,943
Defective product.

20
00:01:26,945 --> 00:01:29,045
Yeah, sometimes the batteries
in these...

21
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,448
giant stuffed dinosaurs
just explode.

22
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,083
Yeah, never buy anything
from Mooselyvania.

23
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:36,619
Mm.
Exactly. Mm.

24
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:39,288
- Okay.
- Uh, guys, this is Jay.

25
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,957
He's the big man around
this neighborhood.

26
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,725
Owns practically
the whole damn thing --

27
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:46,128
the Chinese joint,
the laundromat.

28
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,630
Great. Great, great, great.
Yeah, that's very cool.

29
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:49,131
Can you guys give us a second?

30
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,300
- Great.
- Nice cover.

31
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:53,235
What the hell was that?
I mean, we rolled into town

32
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:54,971
because people were seeing
a lizard monster.

33
00:01:54,973 --> 00:01:56,739
And yes,
we tracked it back here,

34
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,574
but no way did I think we'd end up --
- Killing Barney?

35
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,042
Yeah.

36
00:02:00,044 --> 00:02:01,811
Was pretty satisfying,
though, wasn't it?

37
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:03,312
Probably just
a cursed object.

38
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:04,614
Well, it didn't act like
a cursed object.

39
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:06,182
We should probably do
some digging.

40
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:07,817
Everything all right?

41
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:12,254
Yeah. Yeah, great.

42
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:14,223
Yeah. Uh, we were
just gonna head out.

43
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:15,691
Oh, hold up.

44
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:19,395
You boys saved my life.

45
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:21,697
Anything you want, it's yours.

46
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,833
We could never. We're --
we're just happy we could help.

47
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:26,102
Wait. Uh...

48
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,037
anything?

49
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,473
Hmm.

50
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:38,280
Dean, this is ridiculous.

51
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:40,349
Look, giving us this
made <i>him</i> feel good, okay?

52
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:41,917
- Yeah, where are you gonna put this? You...
- <i>I'm</i> the good guy.

53
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,386
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Take it easy!

54
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:44,787
What?
She's delicate!

55
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,422
She...Pfft.

56
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:49,125
Go that way. I'll lead.
W-what?

57
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,793
Yeah. Dean...
Shh.

58
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,161
Dude, watch out.

59
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:04,340
Hey, what are you doin'?

60
00:03:04,342 --> 00:03:06,542
Uh, research.
Okay.

61
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:08,044
You know,
it's the strangest thing.

62
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:11,547
I-I can't find anything
on a-a cursed object

63
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:13,582
that actually
physically attacks people.

64
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,284
Dude, it's over. All right?

65
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:18,621
Be like Elsa -- Let it go.

66
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,628
"Be like Elsa"?
Ah? Right?

67
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,963
Come here. I need to show you
something. It's important.

68
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:30,800
Come on.

69
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,738
Behold...

70
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,540
the Dean-cave.

71
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,208
Or Fortress of Dean-a-tude.

72
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,610
Just -- still trying
to figure that one out.

73
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,112
We got Foosball.

74
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:46,148
We've got jukebox --
all vinyl, obviously.

75
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,984
Double La-Z-Boy recliners.

76
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:51,120
And, of course, the bar.

77
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:52,722
Still a work-in-progress.

78
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:55,124
It's gonna have a kegerator
because...Well, it's gonna.

79
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:57,159
And finally...

80
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,261
the pi?ce de r?sistance.

81
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:01,263
Okay, hold on, hold on.

82
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:02,765
When did you have time
to do all this?

83
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,934
When it's important,
you make time, Sammy.

84
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:06,469
Wh--

85
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:08,370
Let's give this bad boy
a test run, huh?

86
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:11,240
? Dun, dun ?

87
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:13,476
? Dun... ?

88
00:04:13,478 --> 00:04:15,277
? Dun, Na! ?

89
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:23,385
What the hell?

90
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:34,096
Dean? What just...

91
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:35,564
Aah!
Aah!

92
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,032
You're a cartoon!
You're a cartoon!

93
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:38,434
I'm a cartoon!
I'm a cartoon!

94
00:04:38,436 --> 00:04:40,503
Uh, is -- is this...
Okay, okay, okay.

95
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:41,937
This is dream.
It's gotta be a --

96
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:43,439
Dude!

97
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:45,908
It's not a dream.

98
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,376
Holy crap.

99
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,011
This is, uh...

100
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:50,446
You saw that light.

101
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:52,748
D-did we just get sucked
into the TV?

102
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,151
Or maybe this
is an angel thing.

103
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:57,219
Or -- or the Trickster.

104
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:58,521
No, he's dead.

105
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:00,055
Or <i>is</i> he?

106
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:01,924
Dean, what the hell?

107
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,292
I don't know, Sam. I...

108
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:05,728
Whoa.
Uh...

109
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,697
How did the car get here?

110
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,032
I had the keys in my pocket?

111
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:11,634
Or maybe -- Wait, seriously?

112
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:13,002
That's what's bumping you
about this?

113
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:16,205
Okay, look, are we animated?
Yes.

114
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:18,007
Is it weird? Yes.

115
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,475
It's <i>beyond</i> weird.

116
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:21,710
Well, and "beyond weird"
is kind of our thing.

117
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:24,213
So whatever happened,
we'll figure it out.

118
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:26,916
This is a case,
so let's work it.

119
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:28,350
How?

120
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:30,486
Same as always.

121
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:32,021
We drive.

122
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:43,132
A malt shop. Really?

123
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,067
Look, let's just head in,

124
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,203
ask around,
see what we can see.

125
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:48,804
Oh, my God.

126
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,739
That -- that -- that --
that's, uh, that's...

127
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:53,108
That's the Mystery Machine.

128
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,944
We're not just in any cartoon.

129
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:57,279
We're in Scooby-Doo!

That's
the freakin' Scooby Gang!

134
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,807
Here you are.
Four milkshakes.

135
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:31,347
Great. So we're stuck in
a cartoon with a talking dog.

136
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,384
Not just any talking dog,
<i>the</i> talking dog.

137
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:37,887
The greatest talking dog
in history.

138
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,355
Now come on!

139
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,223
Dibs on Daphne.

140
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:45,361
Jeepers!

141
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,529
Those sure were
some super groovy tunes.

142
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:50,199
Oh, man. This is like a dream come true.

143
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,636
Your dream is to hang out
with the Scooby Gang?

144
00:06:53,638 --> 00:06:56,739
Sam, growing up on the road,
no matter where Dad dragged us,

145
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:59,608
no matter what we did,
there was always a TV.

146
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,878
And you know what
was always on that TV?

147
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,480
Scooby and the gang.

148
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:07,316
These guys, they're our
friggin' role models, man.

149
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:08,784
Except Fred. He's a wad.

150
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:10,185
He's...What?

151
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:13,355
Just think about it --
we do the same thing.

152
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,391
We go to spooky places,
we solve mysteries,

153
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,926
we fight ghosts.

154
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:19,295
Yeah, except our ghosts
don't wear masks,

155
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:21,931
and we don't have
a talking dog.

156
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:24,767
I don't know. I mean, Cass is
kind of like a talking dog.

157
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:27,503
Now, how do I look?

158
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:29,405
-Two-dimensional.
-Perfect!

159
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,874
Uh...hi.

160
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:35,010
Huh?
Uh, uh, I'm Dean. My brother, Sam.

161
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:36,312
Mind if we join you?

162
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:41,417
Of course not!
There's plenty of room.

163
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,685
I'm Fred.

164
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:44,987
This is Velma, Shaggy,
Scooby, and --

165
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:46,488
Daphne.
Hmm?

166
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,090
Enchant?.
Hmm.

167
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:51,093
Of course we know you.
You guys are famous.

168
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,063
Famous?

169
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:57,399
Like, the only thing we're
famous for is our eating skills.

170
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:58,867
Yum, yum, yum.

171
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,203
So looks like you guys
are celebrating something?

172
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:03,205
We are!
We just found out

173
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,908
that Scooby's been named as one
of the heirs to a fortune,

174
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,677
left to him by an old Southern colonel.

175
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:12,081
Scooby saved him from drowning
in a fish pond.

176
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,615
I'm a hero.

177
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:17,653
Scooby.
Okay, okay.

178
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:19,888
But he's dead <i>now,</i> right?

179
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,323
Uh, yeah.

180
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:23,525
Uh, cancer.

181
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:26,528
Give us a second.

182
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,630
Hey, you wanna
pull that stick out of your...

183
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:30,699
nether regions

184
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:32,968
and just play along here?
Play...

185
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,105
There are no words in this newspaper, Dean.

186
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:37,740
We should be trying
to get out of here

187
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:40,909
and instead, you -- you're
hanging out with Marmaduke.

188
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,478
How dare you!

189
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,447
And hitting on Daphne,
when she's clearly with Fred.

190
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:47,282
She's settling, all right?

191
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:49,551
Oh, Daphne could do
so much better.

192
00:08:49,553 --> 00:08:52,354
Last time we got zapped into TV,
we got out by playing our part.

193
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:54,056
This is probably like that.

194
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:56,325
The gang, they're about
to get a mystery.

195
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,826
I don't know, gang.

196
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,462
Sounds like this could be
the start of a mystery.

197
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:02,231
You know, uh, Sam and I

198
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:04,767
are actually
mystery solvers, too.

199
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:06,568
Mind if we tag along?

200
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,037
That sounds like a swell idea.

201
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,040
In fact, I think it's high time
we hit the road.

202
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:13,108
You know what that means?
Uh-huh!

203
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,310
Road food!
Road food!

204
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:20,749
Oh, <i>heck,</i> yes!

205
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:26,455
Sam! Sam!

206
00:09:26,457 --> 00:09:28,190
Look how big my mouth is!

207
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:38,934
Hey, why don't you guys follow
us up to the Colonel's mansion?

208
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:41,804
I don't know, Freddie. I'm not
sure Baby can go that slow.

209
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:44,940
Well, the Mystery Machine is
a lot faster than it looks.

210
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:47,342
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see
who can get there first.

211
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:49,511
Or are you...chicken?

212
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:50,979
Well, I'm game if you are.

213
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,048
Hey, why do you hate Fred
so much?

214
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,050
He thinks he's so cool,
with his perfect hair,

215
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,019
his can-do attitude,

216
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:58,520
that stupid ascot.

217
00:09:58,522 --> 00:09:59,955
Let's do this!

218
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:19,108
Did... did you
just get beat by a microvan?

219
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,843
The light was red!
The light...

220
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:23,512
Fred!

221
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:35,935
Look, all I'm saying is that,
aerodynamically speaking,

222
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:38,471
there is no way my Baby
should lose to...

223
00:10:38,473 --> 00:10:42,142
<i>that.</i> Unless Fred cheated,
which he clearly did.

224
00:10:42,144 --> 00:10:44,411
Dude, get over it.

225
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:47,781
No!

226
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:53,587
"A Night of Fright
is No Delight."

227
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:55,488
What?
That's the episode we're in.

228
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,390
I've seen it, like,
a million times.

229
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:00,260
Attention, everybody.

230
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:04,097
As you all know,
I am Cosgood Creeps,

231
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:07,500
attorney of
the late Colonel Sanders.

232
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:09,035
Shut up.

233
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:11,271
My client was a bit odd.

234
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:15,809
His only directions were
to play this record for you.

235
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:18,011
Yeah! Classic vinyl.

236
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,615
<i>Greetin's, y'all!</i>

237
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:24,084
<i>Cousin Simple, Nephew Norble,</i>

238
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:27,354
<i>Sweet Cousin Maldahyde,</i>
<i>Cousin Slicker,</i>

239
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:30,557
<i>and my old friend, Scooby-Doo.</i>

240
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,427
<i>You're all gonna receive</i>
<i>an equal share of $1 million,</i>

241
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:38,798
<i>providing you spend tonight</i>
<i>here in the old family mansion.</i>

242
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,167
<i>Oh, one more thing --</i>

243
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:43,236
<i>the house is haunted.</i>

244
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:45,872
Haunted?
Haunted?

245
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:47,540
<i>Yes, haunted.</i>

246
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,509
<i>And if any of you can't</i>
<i>make it through the night,</i>

247
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:52,779
<i>his or her share of my fortune</i>
<i>will go to the others.</i>

248
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:56,516
<i>Now good night</i>
<i>and pleasant dreams, y'all.</i>

249
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:00,687
Oh, boy.

250
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,559
What kind of a weirdo
sets all this up?

251
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:09,262
I mean, spend the night in
a haunted house for $1 million?

252
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:10,730
That can't be legal.

253
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:14,067
Sam, come on. The house
isn't really haunted.

254
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:17,337
- I'm not --
- And things like this happen all the time.

255
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,939
Oh, yeah,
maybe in a car--

256
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,643
Dude, what's wrong
with you?

257
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:26,880
They don't know that
they're in a...a C-word.

258
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:28,515
And we're not gonna
tell 'em about anything.

259
00:12:28,517 --> 00:12:30,283
Not where we're from,
not about monsters.

260
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:32,018
Nothing. Capiche?

261
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,187
They are pure
and innocent and good,

262
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:35,755
and we're gonna
keep it that way.

263
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:37,957
Look,
if you've seen this episode,

264
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:40,460
why -- why can't we just
skip to the end?

265
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:42,395
Well, 'cause sometimes
it's about the journey

266
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:43,963
and not the destination.

267
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:47,667
Or do you just want more time
to try and get with Daphne?

268
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,803
Do not ruin this for me!

269
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:52,806
I'll return
to the house in the morning

270
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:55,809
to find out which of you remain,

271
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,277
if any.

272
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,917
Turns out,
he's the bad guy.

273
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,251
You don't say.

274
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:06,653
10:00,

275
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:08,521
and I suggest we all
turn in.

276
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:10,256
So, Daphne...

277
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:12,058
old drafty house.

278
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,661
What say you and I bunk together?

279
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:18,298
Oh, Dean! Boys and girls don't
sleep in the same room, silly.

280
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,100
Come on, Velma.

281
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:21,968
Guess you're with me,
slugger.

282
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,436
Awesome.

283
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:36,349
Relax, Scooby. We'll spend
the night with ya.

284
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,017
Now let's hit the sack.

285
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:42,689
Are you wearing...
a nightgown?

286
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,591
It's called a sleeping robe.

287
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:47,627
Between you and me,
it's freakin' comfortable.

288
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:49,863
It's like
I'm wrapped in hugs.

289
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:52,332
So those new guys are
kinda groovy.

290
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:53,900
Sure, Dean's all right.

291
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:55,769
But that big lug...
What a dummy.

292
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:58,772
"Haunted." Sheesh.
Like that's a real thing.

293
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,774
Huh.
What?

294
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:02,175
Oh, nothing. Just...

295
00:14:02,177 --> 00:14:05,445
I thought big lugs were
kinda your thing.

296
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,981
Huh? Pssh.

297
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,859
Hmm?

298
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:23,630
Huh?

299
00:14:23,632 --> 00:14:25,965
Mm.

300
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:36,176
Is that all you're gonna do? Eat?

301
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:37,911
Relax. In a few minutes,

302
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:39,879
we're gonna find out that
Cousin Simple's missing,

303
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,614
the Scoobies are gonna think
that it's a ghost,

304
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:44,417
but really, it's just the lawyer
Cosgood Creeps in disguise.

305
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:47,387
Told ya.

306
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:50,757
Come on, gang!
Let's check it out!

307
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:05,939
Oh, no!

308
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,440
Wait, wait, wait.

309
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:10,476
No, the dummy bodies don't
show up until later.

310
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:13,847
Dean, this isn't a dummy.
This is blood.

311
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:15,281
He's -- he's dead.

312
00:15:15,283 --> 00:15:17,450
Like -- like, really,
actually dead.

313
00:15:18,954 --> 00:15:20,620
Jinkies!

314
00:15:20,622 --> 00:15:22,288
Jeepers!

315
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,790
Zoinks!

316
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:26,292
Ruh-roh!

317
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:28,027
Son of a bitch.

318
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:33,272
Well, gang, it looks like

319
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:35,841
we've got another mystery
on our hands.

320
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:37,276
Are you kidding me, Fred?

321
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:39,745
Dude, someone's dead.
A little respect.

322
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:42,114
Yeah, <i>Fred.</i>
He can be such a jerk.

323
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:44,650
- Right, Daphne?
- Not really.

324
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:48,054
We should look for evidence...
Huh?!

325
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:50,056
like fingerprints or fluids.
Uh-huh!

326
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:52,625
Fluids?
Dude, this is <i>not</i>

327
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:54,794
the way things went down
in the episode.

328
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:57,129
I remember <i>everything</i>
that happened in Scooby-Doo,

329
00:15:57,131 --> 00:15:58,564
and no one ever got
stabbed in the back

330
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,666
and ended up in a pool
of their own blood.

331
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,635
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

332
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:07,373
Um, so, if that guy can die
for real in this cartoon,

333
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,208
that means we can, too.

334
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,544
It doesn't matter if <i>we</i> die.
Scooby-Doo could die!

335
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:13,712
And that's not happening,
not on my watch.

336
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:16,215
I'd take a bullet for that dog.

337
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:19,885
There has to be a logical
explanation for what's going on.

338
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:23,055
Besides a ghost hunting
us down to collect an inheritance?

339
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:24,723
Yeah, what he said.

340
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:26,725
What would a ghost need with money?

341
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:28,527
Precisely. And besides,

342
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,329
there's no such thing as ghosts.
Huh?

343
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:32,231
So once you eliminate
the impossible,

344
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:35,101
whatever remains,
no matter how improbable,

345
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:37,736
must be the truth.
Look!

346
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:47,713
-Uhh!
-Gotcha!

347
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,482
Uhh! Aah! Uhh!

348
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:52,451
Not today, freak!

349
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:55,788
Cass?
Cass?

350
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,957
Like, you know this guy?

351
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,093
Uh, yeah, yeah. He's a --
he's a friend of ours.

352
00:17:01,095 --> 00:17:02,561
Neato!

353
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,663
Castiel, the Scooby Gang.

354
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,335
Castiel? It sounds like
a great Italian pizza place.

355
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:12,571
Uh, it's a pleasure to meet you.

356
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:15,541
Nice to meet you, too.

357
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:18,711
Sam, Dean...
this dog is talking.

358
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:21,881
- Yep.
- Cass, how did you get here?

359
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:24,817
Well, I was looking for you
at the bunker when...

360
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,685
Sam? Dean?

361
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:30,723
I'm back from Syria with
fruit from the Tree of Life.

362
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,691
The tree was guarded by
a pack of djinn.

363
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:37,563
I killed most of them,
bargained with the rest.

364
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:38,964
Think I'm...

365
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:41,800
technically married to
their queen now.

366
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:43,269
Hello?

367
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,171
Sam?

368
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:47,806
<i>Hey, why don't you guys follow</i>
<i>us up to the Colonel's mansion?</i>

369
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:49,341
<i>I don't know, Freddie.</i>
Dean?

370
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:51,076
<i>I'm not sure Baby can</i>
<i>go that slow.</i>

371
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:54,213
<i>Well, the Mystery Machine is</i>
<i>a lot faster than it looks.</i>

372
00:17:54,215 --> 00:17:56,549
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, let's see</i>
<i>who can get there first.</i>

373
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,851
<i>Or are you...chicken?</i>

374
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:00,352
<i>Well, I'm game if you are.</i>

375
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:02,054
<i>Hey, why do you hate Fred</i>
<i>so much?</i>

376
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:04,823
<i>He thinks he's so cool,</i>
<i>with his perfect hair,</i>

377
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:06,559
<i>his can-do attitude...</i>

378
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:09,295
<i>that stupid ascot.</i>
<i>Let's do this!</i>

379
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,331
<i>I saw purple sparks,</i>
<i>then a flash of light,</i>

380
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,234
<i>and the next thing I knew,</i>
<i>I was in this strange world.</i>

381
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:17,269
<i>I saw you race off...</i>

382
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:17,934
Hey!

383
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,839
<i>and I've been trying to</i>
<i>catch up ever since.</i>

384
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,308
You saw purple sparks?

385
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,610
Dean, that's like with
the killer stuffed dinosaur.

386
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:26,412
And they were both in
that pawn shop.

387
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:27,947
Maybe this
is all connected.

388
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:30,916
Um, "killer stuffed dinosaur"?

389
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:33,185
Oh, I-I didn't mean a real...

390
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:34,820
It's a book we're writing.

391
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,057
Yeah, about...
killer stuffed dinosaurs.

392
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,391
It's called...

393
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:43,128
"The Killer Stuffed Dinosaur
in Love."

394
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,564
Huh. Great title.

395
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:47,600
Yeah. Great title.

396
00:18:47,602 --> 00:18:49,802
Well, if he isn't responsible
for Cousin Simple's death,

397
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:51,904
who is?

398
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:52,924
Huh?

399
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:54,774
Like, somebody turn up
the heat in here, man.

400
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:56,175
It's getting cold.
Huh?

401
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,578
Yikes!

402
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,689
Huh?

403
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,862
No! No! Aah!

404
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,364
Oh!
Sam.

405
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:24,270
Roh!

406
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:34,913
Ph-ph-ph-phantom!

407
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:36,915
Aah!

408
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:41,220
Come on, Sam. We're on.

409
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,855
Yah!

410
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:44,156
Uhh!

411
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:52,531
Gotcha!

412
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:54,933
Uhh! Huh?
Wait, what?

413
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:57,069
G-g-g-g-ghost!

414
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,405
Guys, no. It's not a ghost.

415
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,910
Oh, yeah? Then, man, how did he
just walk through that wall?!

416
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,047
Well, there's probably
a hidden door.

417
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:10,416
Well, whatever it was,
it's gone now.

418
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,452
It looks like he was
coming out of here.

419
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:21,593
Well, that's not good.

420
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,730
I think
I'm gonna be sick.

421
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:26,865
Come on, gang!

422
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:30,636
So do they always just
walk away from dead bodies or...

423
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:33,172
Sam, the cold spot,
fritzing out...

424
00:20:33,174 --> 00:20:35,841
that was a ghost --
<i>our</i> kind of ghost.

425
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:38,844
I think this cartoon
is haunted.

426
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:41,914
All right, Prepmeister Fred,
what's your plan?

427
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,883
We should all split up
and search the house for clues.

428
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:47,119
That's a plan?

429
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,554
Mnh-mnh.

430
00:20:48,556 --> 00:20:50,756
I-I don't think
we should separate.

431
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:52,958
It'll be easier for Dean and me
to keep you safe

432
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,493
if we're all together.

433
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:56,261
Really, Sam?

434
00:20:56,263 --> 00:20:59,164
I wouldn't expect such a big,
broad-shouldered fella like you

435
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,833
to be as chicken as Shaggy.

436
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:02,401
No offense, Shaggy.

437
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:04,169
Like, none taken.

438
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:06,905
If this <i>is</i> a real ghost,
these guys are in trouble.

439
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:08,841
We can't let anything
happen to them.

440
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:12,845
Exactly. So, for now,
let's follow ascot boy's lead.

441
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:14,747
I call team up with Daphne!

442
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:18,150
Great! It'll be
just the three of us.

443
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,818
Sam and I will check the attic.

444
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,521
I mean...
unless you're too scared.

445
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:25,691
What? N-no, I-I'm...
Let's check the attic.

446
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:28,627
Like, man, I guess that
leaves me and old Scoob

447
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:31,263
with you, Castiel.
Wonderful.

448
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:33,499
I once led armies,
and now I'm paired with

449
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,168
a scruffy Philistine and a talking dog.

450
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:40,806
So I guess this is
your first mystery.

451
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:43,675
So if you could keep those
giant linebacker shoulders

452
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,744
from knocking over any clues,
that would be great.

453
00:21:45,746 --> 00:21:49,148
Why do you keep talking
about my shoulders?

454
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,482
Oh, I, uh, huh.

455
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:53,152
Uh...

456
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,123
Aah!

457
00:22:01,662 --> 00:22:04,730
Maybe <i>that</i> was the ghost.

458
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:07,032
Look, I'm not supposed
to tell you this,

459
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,834
but ghosts are real.

460
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:10,636
Huh?
My brother and I, we hunt them,

461
00:22:10,638 --> 00:22:15,073
along with werewolves
and vampires and demons and...

462
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:18,477
We've saved the world.
A lot.

463
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:23,449
Look, Sam,
the simple fact is

464
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:26,151
monsters are nothing more
than crooks in masks --

465
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:29,555
usually unscrupulous
real estate developers.

466
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,490
One, there are way better
real estate scams.

467
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:34,193
- And two --
- Hey, look! A clue.

468
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,830
That's strange.
That's strange.

469
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:39,798
I guess we both noticed
that these toys are

470
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,900
the only things up here
that aren't covered in dust.

471
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,303
Actually, I was noticing this.

472
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:45,904
Ectoplasm.

473
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,739
This gets left behind by ghosts.

474
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,174
Oh, stop already.

475
00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:51,844
You can't really believe
in ghosts.

476
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:56,782
Oh!
Oh!

477
00:22:56,784 --> 00:22:59,518
Told you.
Aah! It's not a g--

478
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,022
It's probably just Christmas
lights and -- and fishing line.

479
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:08,427
So, Daph,

480
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,895
I usually don't have
to do this,

481
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:12,464
but what do you look for
in a guy?

482
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,099
Oh, I don't know.

483
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,934
Strong, sincere,

484
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,337
and an ascot wouldn't hurt.

485
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,710
Whoa, hold on.

486
00:23:26,914 --> 00:23:29,548
Check out that book.

487
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,083
There are a lot of books
in here, Dean.

488
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:32,951
No, <i>that</i> one.

489
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,287
The one that isn't painted into
the background of the car--

490
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,424
Library.
The...library.

491
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:44,196
Huh. Sorry.
I thought it might be

492
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:46,231
some kind of
secret passage or...

493
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:48,066
Aah!

494
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:50,669
Whoa!

495
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,606
Daphne, you okay?

496
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:57,075
Maybe I should just give you
a once-over to make sure.

497
00:23:57,077 --> 00:23:59,144
Aah!

498
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,680
Oh! Oh, <i>hell,</i> no.

499
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:10,188
Like,
did someone open a window?

500
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,125
Yeah, it's cold in here.

501
00:24:22,303 --> 00:24:23,969
Never seen a ghost

502
00:24:23,971 --> 00:24:26,438
wear such a ridiculous costume.

503
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,873
Huh?

504
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,775
Aah!

505
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:32,344
Run! Run!

506
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:35,781
? Scooby Dooby Doo,
where are you? ?

507
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:39,818
? We got some work to do now ?

508
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,688
? Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you? ?
Hey!

509
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,258
? We need some help
from you now ?

510
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,728
? Come on, Scooby-Doo,
I see you ?

511
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,365
? Pretending you got a sliver ?

512
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,668
? You're not foolin' me
'cause I can't see ?

513
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,238
? The way you shake and shiver ?
Hmm.

514
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,974
? You know we got a mystery
to solve ?

515
00:25:01,976 --> 00:25:04,977
Mm-hmm.
? So, Scooby-Doo, be ready for your act ?

516
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:06,979
? Don't hold back ?

517
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:08,647
? And, Scooby-Doo, if you come through ?

518
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:11,984
? You're gonna have yourself
a Scooby Snack ?

519
00:25:11,986 --> 00:25:14,319
? That's a fact! ?

520
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:17,456
? Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you? ?
? Scooby-Doo ?

521
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:20,025
? You're ready and you're willin' ?

522
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:24,863
? Scooby-Doo ?
? If we can count on you, Scooby-Doo ?

523
00:25:24,865 --> 00:25:27,199
? I know we'll catch that villain ?

524
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,136
Guys!

525
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:42,748
We have to stop
this ghost.

526
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,717
We almost did.
Dean had him by the thigh.

527
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:47,119
He what?

528
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:48,954
I almost caught him.
That's the point.

529
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:50,555
Guys, come on.

530
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:52,457
For the last time,
there's no such thing as ghosts.

531
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,737
Oh, no!

532
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:09,441
That costume looks
really...real.

533
00:26:12,346 --> 00:26:14,413
I'll get him.
Fred, don't!

534
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:16,081
Uhh!

535
00:26:17,384 --> 00:26:20,185
Fred!

536
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:21,653
Huh?
Huh?

537
00:26:24,358 --> 00:26:26,658
Oh!
Uhh!

538
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,995
- Like, that's our cue to get out of here!
- Aah!

539
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:32,230
Run!

540
00:26:32,232 --> 00:26:33,699
Aah!

541
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:36,968
Shaggy!

542
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,603
Dean! Iron!

543
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,988
- Oh!
- Oh!

544
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,758
Ah!
What just happened?

545
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,461
Where's Shaggy?
Over here!

546
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:05,063
Like, little help?

547
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:11,511
- [ Shaggy screaming in
- Shaggy!

548
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:14,080
Scooby!

549
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:16,048
Scooby!
Gotcha!

550
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,551
You've got me!
Who's got you?!

551
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:22,221
Oh!

552
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,257
Aah!

553
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,827
Shaggy!

554
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:35,701
Shaggy! Are you okay?

555
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:37,870
Like, do I look like
I'm okay?

556
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:40,239
It appears his arm is broken.

557
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,908
What? That's not --

558
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,212
I have jumped out of a biplane
in a museum and was fine!

559
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:48,748
How did this happen?!
I-I don't know. I...

560
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,716
Something threw me
across the room.

561
00:27:50,718 --> 00:27:52,985
Wires. Probably just wires.

562
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:56,756
Like, hello!
Broken arm here!

563
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,257
Shaggy, brace yourself.

564
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,492
Uhh!

565
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:01,360
Fred,
give me your ascot.

566
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:06,566
Dean, we have to tell them
the truth.

567
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:07,867
What truth?

568
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:10,770
The truth about the phantom.

569
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,538
Look, this phantom isn't like

570
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,307
other ghosts you've faced.

571
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:19,078
He's real. He is a <i>real</i> ghost.

572
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,913
Huh?

573
00:28:20,915 --> 00:28:23,883
Um, I'm not totally
following you.

574
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:26,586
Look, that isn't a guy
in a mask and a costume.

575
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:28,955
It's a vengeful spirit that's
come back from the dead.

576
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,489
That's the truth.

577
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:34,093
So everything you told me,
it's true?

578
00:28:34,095 --> 00:28:35,861
Mm-hmm.

579
00:28:35,863 --> 00:28:39,198
Werewolves? Vampires?
Demons?

580
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,600
Mm-hmm.

581
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:43,769
I thought I was blind
without my glasses,

582
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:46,005
but I was just blind.

583
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:48,774
Oh, how could I be
so stupid?

584
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:50,876
Uh, well, I mean...

585
00:28:50,878 --> 00:28:53,012
We've been stopping
real estate developers

586
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:54,447
when we could've been
hunting Dracula?

587
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,248
Are you kidding me?!

588
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,950
- Ooh. Ah. - Uh...
- My life is meaningless!

589
00:28:57,952 --> 00:28:59,652
If there are ghosts...

590
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,220
that means there's an afterlife.

591
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:02,755
Heaven. Hell.

592
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:04,357
Am I going to hell?!

593
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,392
We told you
<i>every freaking time!</i>

594
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:09,261
But did you ever listen
to Scoob and me? No!

595
00:29:09,263 --> 00:29:12,131
- We're doomed.
- All right, knock it off!

596
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:15,501
Come on! Scooby Gang does not
have nervous breakdowns.

597
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,570
Now you may not have tangled
with the supernatural,

598
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,271
but you've fought monsters,

599
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:20,873
real freakin' psychos.

600
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,742
Well, you stopped Zeke and Zeb.

601
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:24,944
Shaggy figured out that
the sharks Old Iron Face rode

602
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:28,414
were really just torpedoes
disguised to look like sharks.

603
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:30,249
And what about
the Black Knight? Huh?

604
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:31,617
Mamba Wamba?

605
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:33,953
The Space Kook.
I knew it!

606
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,788
You love this show, too.

607
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,123
Mm.

608
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,991
Space Kook,
Ghost Clown,

609
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:40,559
Miner 49er.

610
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:41,994
You guys have all
jumped into danger

611
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:43,863
with no thought for yourselves.

612
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,798
You're heroes, and together,

613
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,633
we're gonna take down
this phantom.

614
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,335
Are you with me?

615
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:50,936
- Yeah!
- - Let's do it!

616
00:29:50,938 --> 00:29:53,139
But how? We don't know
the first thing about

617
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:54,674
fighting real ghosts.

618
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:58,344
We don't have the proper tools
or weapons.

619
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:01,047
That's okay. <i>We</i> do.

620
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:07,186
Ooh. Whoa.

621
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:08,821
Here, Velma, take this.

622
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:11,257
Sam, are you crazy?
They can't use this stuff.

623
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,993
That's a Scooby-don't.
Dean, we've gotta do something.

624
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:16,829
I mean,
you guys are amazing!

625
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:18,330
Thank you, Fred.

626
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:21,033
But we can help. We have to.

627
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:22,702
right you can.

628
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:25,871
You're gonna do what
you do best -- build a trap.

629
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,943
Ahh. That should do it.

630
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:32,611
Lay it on me, Freddy.
Well, you see,

631
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:36,282
Daphne's covered all the exits
except that one with salt.

632
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:37,883
So the phantom will
enter there,

633
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:40,119
tripping the iron chain
that'll activate the ax,

634
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:43,055
which cuts the rope
that holds the coconuts.

635
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:44,590
Where'd he get coconuts?

636
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,192
Shh!
The coconuts are gonna roll,

637
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:48,260
tripping the phantom,
sending him careening down

638
00:30:48,262 --> 00:30:50,796
a slide of soap,
right into the washing machine

639
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:53,899
which we'll secure with
those iron chains.

640
00:30:53,901 --> 00:30:55,468
And with the ghost captured,

641
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,870
we can finally find out
what's going on.

642
00:30:57,872 --> 00:31:01,040
Now all we need...is bait.

643
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:05,644
You think the phantom
decided to leave?

644
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:07,313
No, it's still here.
Don't worry.

645
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:10,349
That's what
I'm worried about.

646
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:15,821
Hmm. Mm-hmm?

647
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:20,960
Aah! Run!

648
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:33,706
Aah!

649
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:40,212
- Shaggy Whoa!
- Aah! Whoa! -

650
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,550
Aah! Whoa!

651
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:48,220
Ahh. Whoa!

652
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:57,229
I told you
it wasn't going to work.

653
00:31:57,231 --> 00:31:58,898
Yeah, Fred's traps
never work.

654
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,800
Daph, Plan B!

655
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:02,234
Operation Bookworm is go.

656
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,014
Aah!

657
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,118
Good shot, Scoob old buddy.
Give him another one.

658
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,523
Scooby, now!

659
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,640
That's a salt circle.
You're stuck.

660
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:45,411
<i>Let...me...go!</i>

661
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:46,779
Happy to, Sparky,

662
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:48,948
soon as you tell us
who you really are.

663
00:32:58,526 --> 00:33:00,526
It's...a child.

664
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:02,461
Yeah, creepy ghost kid.
You get used to 'em.

665
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:06,165
But...Wait.
Why are you trying to kill us?

666
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,566
<i>I'm not.</i>

667
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,568
<i>I never wanted to hurt anyone.</i>

668
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,504
<i>But the bad man, he makes me.</i>

669
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:13,939
The bad man?

670
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:15,507
<i>His name is Jay.</i>

671
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:17,343
The dude from the pawnshop.

672
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:21,247
<i>When I died, my soul was</i>
<i>tied to a pocketknife.</i>

673
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,783
<i>My dad gave it to me.</i>
<i>It meant everything.</i>

674
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:28,454
<i>When Jay found me,</i>
<i>he used me to...</i>

675
00:33:30,057 --> 00:33:32,625
<i>Sometimes, I get so angry</i>

676
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:36,195
<i>I break things, hurt people.</i>

677
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:37,596
<i>But I don't want to.</i>

678
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,465
<i>I just wanna see my dad again.</i>

679
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:44,169
I'm sorry. It was wrong
of him to do that.

680
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:46,005
None of this was your fault.

681
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:48,007
Look, if you get us
back to the real world,

682
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:49,775
we can set you free.

683
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,243
<i>Do you promise?</i>

684
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:53,479
Cross my heart
and hope to d--

685
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:55,681
Well,
you know what I mean.

686
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:00,920
Should I -- should I make
another trap?

687
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:02,321
I could get the shotgun!

688
00:34:02,323 --> 00:34:04,123
I could get <i>two</i> shotguns!

689
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,458
Like, tell Scoob and me
when it's over!

690
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,127
Yeah!

691
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,962
Okay, okay, hey,
give me a minute.

692
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,231
We can't leave 'em
like this.

693
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:13,499
Kid, we need a favor.

694
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:16,902
- Aah! Uhh!
- Did you send it back

695
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:18,337
to the fiery pit
from whence it came?!

696
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:20,072
Look, everything's
under control.

697
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:21,707
- Aah!
- - Kill it with fire!

698
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:25,244
Whoa! Slow your roll, guys.
We were wrong.

699
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:26,645
Huh?

700
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,314
What -- what are you --
what are you saying?

701
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,417
Velma...w-was right.

702
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:33,118
Like, she was?

703
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,756
This wasn't a real ghost.
We were fooled.

704
00:34:37,758 --> 00:34:39,858
But you never were,
right, Velma?

705
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,161
I, uh...I don't know.

706
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,897
Hey, guys,
do your thing.

707
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:48,968
This is my favorite part.

708
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:53,539
Cosgood Creeps?!

709
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,574
But...the flying.

710
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:57,209
Wires.
Huh.

711
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:59,144
What about the walking
through the walls?

712
00:34:59,146 --> 00:35:00,679
And the bodies?

713
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,248
Well, that was just
a projector.

714
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,084
As for the bodies...

715
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:06,752
Were they...dummies filled
with corn syrup?

716
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:08,654
Huh?
Exactly.

717
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,222
Of course!

718
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:12,157
Cosgood was trying to drive
everyone from the house

719
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,360
so he could get the money
for himself.

720
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,563
Right. But the joke is on him
because the money's worthless.

721
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,131
It's all
Confederate dollars.

722
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:21,100
Aw! Oh, well.

723
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:25,204
Easy come, easy go.

724
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,672
So...

725
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:28,173
I <i>was</i> right.

726
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:29,775
I told ya, ya big lug.

727
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:32,845
There's no such thing as
the supernatural.

728
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:34,580
Huh?

729
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:36,982
Looks like you were right,
and now we know.

730
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:41,286
Hey, my arm's feeling better.

731
00:35:41,288 --> 00:35:44,656
Don't think it was
really broken after all.

732
00:35:44,658 --> 00:35:46,125
This is great news!

733
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:48,260
Let's meet at the malt shop
and celebrate.

734
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:51,330
Sure, Fred. And hey,
you're not so bad.

735
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:54,266
Yeah, I know. Thanks.

736
00:35:54,268 --> 00:35:55,801
So, uh...

737
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:58,570
I guess this is it.
This is what?

738
00:35:58,572 --> 00:36:00,139
Shh.

739
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:02,875
No words. We'll never
know what could've been.

740
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:06,678
Freddy, wait for me!

741
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,926
I will miss your wise words
and your gentle spirits.

742
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:12,317
Like, we will miss
breathing.

743
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:13,786
Uhh!Ohh!

744
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:15,320
Thank you.

745
00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:16,755
You've shown me
the great strength

746
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,957
of laughter in the face
of danger.

747
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:21,226
Danger?! Where?!
Let's get out of here, man.

748
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:22,828
- Aah!
- Oh!

749
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,663
Great working with you,
Velma.

750
00:36:24,665 --> 00:36:25,998
You, too, Sam.

751
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:30,369
Mmm. Mwah.

752
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,506
Those <i>shoulders.</i>

753
00:36:34,508 --> 00:36:36,542
Jinkies!

754
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:37,776
Shoulda known
Velma was good to go.

755
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,045
Gah! It's always
the quiet ones.

756
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,117
We're ready.

757
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,028
Okay.

758
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,397
That was...something.

759
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:01,867
<i>That</i> was the coolest thing
that's ever happened to me.

760
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:03,802
And that includes
the Cartwright twins.

761
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:07,239
What did you do with
the Cartwright twins?

762
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:11,076
Oh.

763
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:12,711
I'll be right back.

764
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:16,915
I don't think I wanna know.

765
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,793
Well, sorry, sweetheart.

766
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:01,193
Time to go, kid.

767
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,662
<i>What about the bad man?</i>

768
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:05,797
Don't worry about him.

769
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:08,367
We'll take care of him,
all right?

770
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,289
You sure about this?

771
00:38:55,291 --> 00:39:00,027
Look, you're gettin'
this place for a steal.

772
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:01,928
But...

773
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,865
I'm too old for this crap.

774
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:07,301
If you say so.

775
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,270
Just, uh,
two more signatures, and...

776
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,710
Not so fast.

777
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:20,881
Is that an ascot?

778
00:39:23,852 --> 00:39:25,352
Yes.

779
00:39:25,354 --> 00:39:27,988
Yes, it is.

780
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,391
Uh, what are you guys
doing here?

781
00:39:31,393 --> 00:39:33,427
Hey, Alan, your friend here,

782
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:35,295
he's been driving people
off their property

783
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:38,231
so he could buy it on the cheap.

784
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:43,670
And he's been using his own
personal ghost to do it.

785
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,239
You see, he'd plant
the haunted object,

786
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:48,175
then let the ghost go to work.

787
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,177
Then they would
possess something,

788
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:54,548
like a big dinosaur
or a perfectly beautiful TV.

789
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,685
And scare people so much that
they'd be desperate to sell.

790
00:40:00,055 --> 00:40:01,588
When we got nosy...

791
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,024
<i>I think we should probably</i>
<i>keep doing some digging.</i>

792
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,393
<i>Everything all right?</i>
<i>Where you gonna put this?</i>

793
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:07,794
...he sicced
his pet ghost on us.

794
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:10,764
<i>Take it easy!</i>
<i>What?</i>

795
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:13,066
<i>She's delicate, all right?</i>
<i>I'll lead.</i> <i>Oh, she...Pfft.</i>

796
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:16,103
<i>"She"? She? Really, she?</i>

797
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:22,709
But now, that spirit is freed.

798
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:28,915
They're lying.

799
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,817
They're...

800
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:33,453
You think anyone's gonna
believe that?

801
00:40:33,455 --> 00:40:36,623
No, but that's why
we hacked your financials.

802
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:39,593
Turns out you're not so big
on paying your taxes, are ya?

803
00:40:39,595 --> 00:40:41,862
Good enough for Capone,
good enough for you.

804
00:40:50,172 --> 00:40:51,705
Come on.

805
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:57,010
Ha! Velma was right.

806
00:40:57,012 --> 00:40:59,996
It was a shady real estate
developer after all.

807
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,381
Here you go.

808
00:41:00,382 --> 00:41:02,082
It's not fair.

809
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,517
I would've gotten away with it

810
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,185
if it wasn't for
those meddling kids.

811
00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:07,654
He said it!

812
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:09,289
- He said the line!
- Watch your head.

813
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:13,994
Scooby Dooby Doo!

814
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,132
What are you doing?

815
00:41:19,134 --> 00:41:20,567
Well, I mean, at the end
of every mystery,

816
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:22,502
Scooby looks into the camera
and he says --

817
00:41:22,504 --> 00:41:26,373
Dean, you're not
a talking dog.

818
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,977
I know that. I...

819
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:34,014
Yeah.

820
00:41:34,016 --> 00:41:37,350
No, but come on, I-I do
look cool with the ascot, right?

821
00:41:37,352 --> 00:41:38,819
No?

822
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:40,654
Guys? Come on, guys.

823
00:41:40,656 --> 00:41:41,611
Look, red is my color!
