1
00:00:01,723 --> 00:00:03,089
My name is Dean Winchester.

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:05,038
That big fella in there
is my brother Sam.

3
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:07,172
We kill monsters.

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,142
Aah!

5
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,844
So what are you,
some kind of superhero?

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,749
Well, goodbye, Cass.
Goodbye, Kelly.

7
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:19,185
Goodbye, Crowley.
Goodbye, Mom.

8
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:22,055
- Dean, we don't know if Mom --
- Yeah, we do. They're all gone.

9
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:24,924
Jack doesn't have to be evil.
We can teach him not to be.

10
00:00:24,926 --> 00:00:27,126
I know you think that
you can use him as some sort

11
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:30,430
of an interdimensional
can opener, and that's fine.

12
00:00:30,432 --> 00:00:32,065
But don't act like
you care about him,

13
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,133
because you only care about
what he can do for you.

14
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,568
And what about Cass?
What about Cass?

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,670
He manipulated him.
He made him promises.

16
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:40,740
Said “Paradise on Earth,”
and Cass bought it.

17
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:43,343
And you know what that got him?
It got him dead!

18
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:45,511
Castiel.

19
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,613
<i>Castiel.</i>

20
00:00:52,787 --> 00:01:00,360
?

21
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,831
Hi.

22
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,702
No.

23
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:11,504
How? You're...

24
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:14,340
...dead.

25
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:17,110
I was. But...

26
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:19,979
aren't you
gonna say hi back?

27
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,517
Hi.

28
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:27,653
I missed you, Baby Bear.

29
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,356
Uhh! Aah!

30
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:41,534
?

31
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:46,973
?

Hey. How you feelin'?

35
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:06,559
What you, uh,
what you working on?

36
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:08,027
Dead guy in Madison.

37
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:10,563
Police say it was
a home invasion,

38
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:14,100
but neighbor claims that
she saw the vic's <i>dead wife</i>

39
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:15,535
leave the crime scene.

40
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:16,869
Let's check it out.

41
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,738
What, you ready
to ditch Damien?

42
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,773
What do you wanna do?
Leave him in a ring of holy oil

43
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:23,176
with some Netflix
and a frozen pizza?

44
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:24,944
Ha.

45
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:26,879
No.

46
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:30,450
Actually... I thought
we'd, uh, bring him along.

47
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:33,920
Uh, <i>hell,</i> no.

48
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:37,790
What, “Adventures in
Babysitting” the Antichrist?

49
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,091
No, thank you.

50
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:42,195
Dean, we can't hide him forever.

51
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:45,331
And, you know, just keeping him
cooped up here isn't working.

52
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,633
Yeah, it is, actually.
You wanna know why?

53
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,535
Because as long as he's here,

54
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:53,306
he's not out there
doing God knows what.

55
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:54,907
So what, does this mean
that your plan

56
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,876
for bringing Mom back
isn't working?

57
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:58,411
'Cause I'll say it again --

58
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,146
Mom's dead, Sam.

59
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:02,381
Lucifer ripped out
her freakin' heart.

60
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,850
Now the sooner you can
wrap your head around that,

61
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:05,985
the sooner we can all move on.

62
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:11,257
So you're saying you want
to move on, from Mom.

63
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:19,966
Right now, I wanna kill
some dead guy's dead wife.

64
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:21,767
Dean, that isn't what
this is about.

65
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,536
Jack needs to get out.

66
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,639
He needs to get some air.
We all do.

67
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:28,908
He's a good kid.

68
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,077
He is. Just...

69
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,179
give him a chance, please.

70
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,648
For me.

71
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,222
Jack?

72
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:49,328
Hey.

73
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,264
“Clone Wars”?

74
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:53,266
The computer said
I'd like it.

75
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:55,635
I do like Ahsoka.

76
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:57,103
Kinda hate Anakin.

77
00:03:57,105 --> 00:04:01,007
Uh...that's probably
for the best.

78
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,609
Never mind. Um, hey.

79
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,478
You remember when I told you
what Dean and I do?

80
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,313
Our, uh, our day job?

81
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:10,149
You kill monsters
because you're the good guys.

82
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,551
Right, right.

83
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:14,620
And we've got a case, so...

84
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,289
thought you might want
to come along.

85
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,190
No.

86
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:23,629
Jack, I really think this
would be good for you.

87
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,032
You know, maybe a change
of scenery might --

88
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:27,667
Get my powers working again?

89
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,168
Yeah, maybe.

90
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,570
So I can be

91
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:33,339
your “interdimensional
can opener”?

92
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,812
You're using me.

93
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,850
Jack...

94
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,353
when you were born,

95
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:51,357
it ripped a hole in reality.

96
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:55,861
Like a -- like a door from
this world to another,

97
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:59,632
to...a really bad, bad place.

98
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,902
So -- so Dean and Cass and I,

99
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:06,872
we -- we closed that door.
But...

100
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,474
our mom, Mary,

101
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:11,043
she's trapped
on the other side.

102
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:13,813
If we can
get your powers back,

103
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,281
maybe we can
open that door up.

104
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:18,017
Maybe...

105
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:21,253
You wanna save her.

106
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:25,558
Yeah.

107
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,226
Yeah, I do.

108
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,329
But...

109
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:35,735
if this doesn't work,
if that can't happen,

110
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:37,970
that's okay,

111
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:39,972
because I do
care about you.

112
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,509
But I should've told you.

113
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:46,779
I'm sorry.
It's a lot and, uh...

114
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,916
Dean can't even look at me.

115
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,620
He wants to kill me.

116
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,789
I won't let that happen.

117
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:04,597
Listen, if there's one thing
Dean respects, it's effort.

118
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:07,600
So come along, help us out.

119
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:10,936
Let's go be the good guys.

120
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:23,449
Agent Bonham, Agent Seger,

121
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,185
Special Agent Anderson --
These are you?

122
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:27,820
Yeah, sometimes.

123
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:30,423
I thought lying was wrong.

124
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:32,491
All right, here we go.
Victim -- Wes Bailey.

125
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,560
His wife, Erica,
died six months ago.

126
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,662
Heart thing, out of the blue.
Uh, question is,

127
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:38,998
why'd she come back from
the dead and knife his ass?

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,566
People come back?

129
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,935
When a person dies
and their soul can't move on --

130
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,403
They're called ghosts.

131
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,938
And hanging around makes them
go loony tunes.

132
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,673
Uh, they go crazy.

133
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:50,176
Yeah, question is, since when
do ghosts kill somebody

134
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:52,278
and walk out the front door?

135
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,713
So maybe it's a revenant.

136
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:55,448
Wait. What's a revenant?

137
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,917
A revenant's more like
a-a zombie.

138
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,653
Hey, there's our witness.

139
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,822
Jack, we're gonna talk
to the witness,

140
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:05,224
check out the crime scene.

141
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:09,228
You stay. Sit.

142
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:16,135
Now you're sure it was
his wife?

143
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:18,471
I've lived next to Erica
for six years.

144
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:21,440
I watered her plants every time
she and Wes took vacation.

145
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,175
What about that night?

146
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:24,510
You notice anything else?

147
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:27,012
Maybe, uh, flickering lights,
cold spots?

148
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,782
I...

149
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:31,584
I think a street light
did flicker.

150
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:32,852
M--

151
00:07:32,854 --> 00:07:34,386
M-maybe.

152
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,093
?

153
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:43,863
We got a runner.

154
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:45,531
Thank you.

155
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:51,203
?

156
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,739
Hey! I told you to wait
in the car.

157
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,174
What the hell are you doing?

158
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:57,376
I'm trying to help out.

159
00:07:57,378 --> 00:08:00,179
How is this helping out?
Hey, Dean.

160
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:03,215
Thank you, Jack.
Did you find anything?

161
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,584
Just this.

162
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,853
Oh.

163
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,422
All right. Jack, look.

164
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,891
This is an EMF meter.

165
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:13,292
Okay, so spirits, ghosts,

166
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:15,761
they put out
electromagnetic interference.

167
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:18,564
If one's here,
this will tell us.

168
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,304
What's it saying?

169
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:27,339
It's saying it's a revenant.

170
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,375
We gotta check her grave.

171
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:30,810
Come on.

172
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:36,415
?

173
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,184
All right, well,
you said you wanted to help,

174
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:41,821
so, uh...dig.

175
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:45,024
Dean, what's up with
all the orders?

176
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:47,293
You're starting
to sound like Dad.

177
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:49,328
That a bad thing?
I'm just saying

178
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,164
his -- his drill sergeant act
worked with you...

179
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,666
but it didn't work with me.

180
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:55,267
And that's not the way we're
gonna get through to Jack.

181
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,103
Look, you wanted the kid here,
he's here. All right?

182
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,740
But I'm not gonna hold his hand
and tuck him in at night. Pass.

183
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:05,377
I'm not gonna be his mother,
and neither are you.

184
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,480
And the kid can dig,
so I'll give him that.

185
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:14,320
?

186
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,996
All right, I guess
we're back to ghost.

187
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,531
Yeah.

188
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:28,067
So a body rules out revenant.

189
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:30,603
All right, I don't get it.

190
00:09:30,605 --> 00:09:32,371
I mean, a ghost that won't
show up on EMF?

191
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:34,006
Doesn't make any sense.

192
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,542
Yeah, well,
what does these days?

193
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:37,943
You know, I mean, we --

194
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,079
we've got portals
to apocalyptic worlds.

195
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,648
We've got, uh,
shape-shifting demons.

196
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,351
Dealing with a whole new set
of tiddlywinks.

197
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:49,121
I say we just...
do what we do.

198
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:51,991
My mother --
could she be a ghost?

199
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:54,693
No, we, um...

200
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,862
we burned the body.

201
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,098
That's right,

202
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,200
and what gets burned...

203
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:02,868
stays dead.

204
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,677
Hello?

205
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:19,685
Hello!

206
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,525
Hello?

207
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,497
Hello!

208
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:44,473
<i>Roadside</i>
<i>assistance. May I help you?</i>

209
00:10:44,497 --> 00:10:47,064
I blew a tire, out on Route 19.

210
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:50,434
<i>Okay, no problem. We'll get</i>
<i>someone right out there.</i>

211
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:55,239
?

212
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,041
Scotty?

213
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:59,877
Oh! Baby!

214
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,481
?

215
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:10,454
Thank you.

216
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:13,924
Well? Get anything?

217
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:16,593
Yeah, cops found the victim,
Gloria Simon, about an hour ago.

218
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:17,795
Something ripped her apart.

219
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:19,897
Our kind of something?
No.

220
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,167
Gloria was on the phone
with roadside assistance when she died.

221
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:25,369
Operator said she was talking
to someone named Scotty.

222
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:26,704
And?

223
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:28,639
According to the cops,
Scotty is her son.

224
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:31,508
Uh, <i>was</i> her son.

225
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,177
He drowned in '96.

226
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:39,183
So we got two ghosts
in two days, and...

227
00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:41,218
no EMF.

228
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,720
So?

229
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:44,588
So, aside from getting dead,

230
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,824
what do Gloria and Wes
have in common?

231
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:57,768
?

232
00:11:58,037 --> 00:12:07,845
?

233
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:15,753
?

234
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:20,891
Where's Jack?

235
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:23,560
Across the street.
Food run.

236
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,232
Dean, he's not our intern.

237
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:29,900
I asked you to keep
an eye on him.

238
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:31,769
I can see him.

239
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:35,439
He keeps staring at me.
Yes, he wants you to like him.

240
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,876
All right, whatever.
Here, take a look.

241
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:40,611
What's this? Her diary?
It's a grief journal.

242
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:43,380
Cops found one at
the first crime scene also.

243
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:45,249
Wes and Gloria were both seeing
the same grief counselor --

244
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:46,617
Mia Vallens.

245
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:48,819
And apparently,
she gives homework.

246
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:51,922
Hmm. Shrinks.
Snake oil for the mind.

247
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:54,591
Or how healthy people deal.
Yeah?

248
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:57,428
All right, let's see how good
old, uh, Gloria was dealing.

249
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,096
Here you go.

250
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:01,932
“And now that
I've achieved catharsis,

251
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:03,767
I can truly see
the program works.”

252
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:05,235
“The program”? Come on, man.

253
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:07,771
I mean, she's one Kool-Aid
away from Jonestown.

254
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:12,242
What'd Wes' “journal” say?
More of the same.

255
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:14,678
Um, he was really into
the whole catharsis thing.

256
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,113
Yeah, sure. Who wouldn't be?

257
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:18,148
I mean, it's like another word
for “happy ending.”

258
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,650
Hi, Jack.

259
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,085
What took you so long?

260
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,620
The man in front of me
wanted extra kraut,

261
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:26,323
but the hot dog man
didn't have any.

262
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:28,826
He was really angry.

263
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:30,994
Mmm. That's a cool story.

264
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:37,067
So let's say that Hannibal chick
is, um, a medium, right?

265
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:38,635
She's talkin' to spirits,
she's pissing them off somehow.

266
00:13:38,637 --> 00:13:41,772
A ghost shows up,
notches a kill, and takes off.

267
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:44,141
Yeah, but then, what?
Once it's gone, no EMF?

268
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:46,243
This woman can talk to ghosts?

269
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:47,511
If she's the real deal,

270
00:13:47,513 --> 00:13:49,746
mediums can do all kinds
of freaky crap.

271
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:51,982
All right, say you're right.

272
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,350
Can't go in as FBI,

273
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:55,018
not with doctor/patient
confidentiality.

274
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,889
All right. So we have to
go in as something else.

275
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:06,130
- This is a dumb idea.
- Just follow my lead.

276
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:07,931
Yeah, doctor's gonna eat
our liver

277
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,954
with some fava beans
and a bottle of Chianti.

278
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:13,137
Hello.

279
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:18,275
Hello.

280
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:25,482
Hello?

281
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:27,084
Can I help you?

282
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:29,786
Yeah, we're, uh...
hoping to see the doctor.

283
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:31,722
Oh, I'm sorry. You caught us
right at the end of our day.

284
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:33,157
Maybe tomorrow.

285
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:36,260
No, today's good.
Like right now.

286
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:39,263
He -- Uh, we just need
a moment of her time.

287
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:41,031
You've lost someone recently?

288
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:43,033
No.
My mother.

289
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:47,037
Um, <i>our</i> mother. We're having
a difficult time.

290
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,906
Mia Vallens.

291
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:51,141
Hi. Dean.

292
00:14:51,143 --> 00:14:53,076
That's our little brother Jack,
and I'm Sam.

293
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:55,345
I see. Please, this way.

294
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:57,147
Sure.

295
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:58,549
Listen, Mr. Spock,

296
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:01,585
you speak when I tell you
to speak, okay?

297
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:03,820
- Yes.
- Good.

298
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:07,024
Your mother --
she passed suddenly?

299
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:08,559
Uh, yeah.

300
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:12,429
Mm. Most of the people I see
are in the same boat.

301
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:14,131
No warning,

302
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:15,799
no goodbye,

303
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,734
no closure.

304
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:20,871
Right, yeah. Pretty much
the same for us. Um...

305
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:24,775
So how does this usually work?
You know, with your patients?

306
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:29,279
Usually, they just start talking
about the person they've lost.

307
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:31,048
All right, well, Mom was great,
now she's dead.

308
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,583
What's the deal with
catharsis?

309
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:33,951
I'm sorry?

310
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:35,519
Uh, we -- we were wondering
what that is.

311
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:38,288
Um, a patient of yours,
Gloria Simon,

312
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,357
she referred us.
She's a family friend.

313
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,892
I don't talk about my patients,

314
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:44,695
and Gloria wasn't supposed
to talk about me.

315
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:46,296
Sure. Um, got it.

316
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:47,664
But your process --

317
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,866
My <i>program</i> is
a range of things.

318
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:52,703
Talk therapy, meditation.

319
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:56,506
You ever journal?

320
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:58,809
Our dad did.

321
00:15:58,811 --> 00:16:01,011
Dean?

322
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:02,446
You journal?

323
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:04,314
Ever since I was
a little girl.

324
00:16:05,985 --> 00:16:09,519
You think this shrink stuff
is a load of crap. Am I right?

325
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:11,955
How'd you guess?
Then why are you here?

326
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:15,225
Because, uh, we all agreed
we'd give it a shot, right?

327
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:19,162
Right?

328
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:21,398
My brother, he's not, uh,

329
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,233
he's not processing
his grief.

330
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:24,835
Mm.
Really?

331
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:27,337
No, I'm...
No, I'm good, actually.

332
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:31,208
With death, closure,
whole freakin' bottle of Jack.

333
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,609
Are you?

334
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:35,879
Yeah. Because <i>I</i> know
that Mom's dead,

335
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:37,914
and <i>I</i> know that
she's not coming back.

336
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:41,218
Okay, I hear what you're saying.
I just wish...

337
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,186
You wish he'd be more open
to therapy?

338
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:46,256
Sure. Exactly.

339
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:50,560
All right, this is
a safe place, right, Doc?

340
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,397
Okay.
My brother's delusional.

341
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,831
Dean.

342
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,700
You said you wanted to
give this a shot, right?

343
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:58,235
Here we go.

344
00:16:58,237 --> 00:17:00,537
He won't even admit that
Mom's dead. Won't even admit it.

345
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:01,072
Stop.

346
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:02,607
Because if he admits it,
then it's real.

347
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:05,175
If it's real, then he has
to deal with it,

348
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:06,877
and he can't handle that.

349
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,845
Right, because this is
so easy for you, huh?

350
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:10,280
No, it's not easy.

351
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:12,149
Yeah, but at least you had
a relationship with Mom.

352
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:14,217
I mean, who would she
always call?

353
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,687
Who did she look to for everything?
Okay.

354
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:18,789
You had something with her
I never had.

355
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,290
And now I'm just supposed
to accept that

356
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:22,159
I never will have it?

357
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:30,100
?

358
00:17:46,418 --> 00:17:56,660
?

359
00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:01,598
?

360
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,982
?

361
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:20,417
Mm.

362
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:26,990
?

363
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:38,869
?

364
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:44,608
?

365
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:57,129
Problem?

366
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:58,116
You just upset
your brother so much,

367
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:00,017
he had to leave the room.

368
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:04,588
And Jack? Look at him.

369
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:08,425
He's terrified of you.

370
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:11,728
Nah. No, we're simpatico.
Right, kid?

371
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,699
We're simpatico.

372
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:19,903
Convincing.

373
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:24,074
You're angry, Dean.

374
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:25,509
And?

375
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,210
And if you don't want
to do anything about it,

376
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:28,879
that's your business.

377
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:31,381
But you're aiming it
at everyone in your life.

378
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:35,319
She's a shape-shifter!
No, no.

379
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,654
I found hair and...teeth.

380
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:39,690
You must've shed your skin,
what, couple hours ago?

381
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:41,525
And here, I just thought
she was annoying.

382
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:43,493
What's going on?
Doc's a monster.

383
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:46,463
She killed her patients.
No! No. No.

384
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:49,199
?

385
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:51,568
I am what you say,

386
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,937
but I have never
killed anyone.

387
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:56,406
Then what are you doing here?
I'm helping people.

388
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:57,874
<i>My patients.</i>

389
00:19:57,876 --> 00:20:00,277
I just miss her so much.

390
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,480
<i>I shift into the person</i>
<i>that they've lost</i>

391
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:05,849
<i>so that they could see them</i>
<i>one last time,</i>

392
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:08,051
<i>so that they can say goodbye.</i>

393
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:10,821
Oh, my God.

394
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:13,690
<i>Well, Wes Bailey...</i>
Uhh!

395
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:16,727
Gloria Simon...

396
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,228
they're both dead.

397
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,796
What?

398
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:21,965
Gloria was killed by her son,

399
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,067
or at least someone
who looked like him.

400
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:25,769
Three nights ago,
Wes was killed by somebody

401
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,871
who looked like his dead wife.

402
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,842
So you wanna tell us how
you're innocent again?

403
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:33,844
Okay, I, um...

404
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:36,546
I have an alibi for Wes.

405
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:38,415
I volunteer at
the women's shelter downtown.

406
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:42,619
I was there that night.
You can call them.

407
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:46,923
I know you guys are Hunters.

408
00:20:46,925 --> 00:20:51,161
But please, I am
telling you the truth.

409
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:56,099
?

410
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,468
I know you're there.

411
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,370
I can feel you.

412
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:04,141
<i>Hello.</i>

413
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:11,148
What are you?

414
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,785
<i>Oh, I'm just your friendly</i>
<i>neighborhood cosmic entity.</i>

415
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:18,088
Why do you look like me?

416
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,024
<i>Oh, yes. Yes, yes.</i>

417
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:23,126
<i>Well, I show up in</i>
<i>my real form,</i>

418
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:26,496
<i>and you freak out, rip out</i>
<i>your own eyes, et cetera.</i>

419
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:30,133
<i>That would be embarrassing,</i>
<i>wouldn't it, for both of us?</i>

420
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:32,269
What is this place?

421
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:35,639
<i>Oh, yes.</i>
<i>Excellent question.</i>

422
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:40,343
<i>You see,</i>
<i>before God and Amara,</i>

423
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:42,546
<i>creation, destruction,</i>
<i>Heaven, Hell,</i>

424
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:46,183
<i>your precious little Earth,</i>
<i>what was there?</i>

425
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:48,218
Nothing.

426
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,955
<i>Yes. That's right. Nothing.</i>

427
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:54,491
<i>Nothing but Empty.</i>

428
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:56,660
<i>And you are soaking in it.</i>

429
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:59,963
<i>Angels and demons, you all</i>
<i>come here when you die.</i>

430
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:04,334
Every angel that ever died
is here?

431
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:06,369
<i>Yes,</i>

432
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:09,639
<i>sleeping an endless</i>
<i>peaceful sleep.</i>

433
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:12,843
<i>You know, I...</i>
<i>I was sleeping, too.</i>

434
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:15,545
<i>Hey, uh, since we're pals,</i>

435
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:17,180
<i>there's something</i>
<i>I've gotta know.</i>

436
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:18,615
<i>I've just gotta ask.</i>

437
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:22,452
<i>Hmm. Why are you awake?</i>

438
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:24,788
<i>'Cause fun fact --</i>

439
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,123
<i>in all of forever,</i>

440
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,792
<i>nothing ever wakes up here.</i>

441
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:30,727
<i>I mean, ever. Ever.</i>
<i>And second fun fact --</i>

442
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:34,598
<i>when you woke up, I woke up,</i>
<i>and I don't like being awake.</i>

443
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,401
<i>So...what's up, smart guy?</i>

444
00:22:38,403 --> 00:22:40,036
I don't know.

445
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:41,705
<i>Well, think!</i>

446
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:43,139
The Winchesters.

447
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:45,408
Sam and Dean,
they must've made a deal.

448
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,912
<i>No. No, no, no.</i>

449
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,614
<i>Not with me, and I'm --</i>

450
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:54,384
<i>I'm the only one that has</i>
<i>any pull here.</i>

451
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:58,221
<i>Not Heaven, not Hell,</i>
<i>not G-O-D himself.</i>

452
00:22:58,223 --> 00:23:00,724
<i>So think harder.</i>

453
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:03,693
<i>Rack that perky little brain</i>
<i>of yours.</i>

454
00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:05,161
Stay away from me.

455
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:07,898
<i>Okay, fine.</i>
<i>I'll rack it for you.</i>

456
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,174
All right. Alibi checks out.

457
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:20,610
What?

458
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:22,212
Yeah, I'm surprised, too.

459
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:25,482
Okay. Well, if you're not doing
this, then who is?

460
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:29,986
Oh, God. I think I know.

461
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:31,788
Hey.

462
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,531
His name's Buddy.

463
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:45,368
When we got together,
I was young and stupid.

464
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,204
He's a shifter, like me.

465
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:50,840
The only one I'd ever met
other than my mother.

466
00:23:50,842 --> 00:23:52,609
But he liked hurting people.

467
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:55,512
Did he hurt you?

468
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:58,748
I left.

469
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,519
Changed my face, my name.

470
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,854
Buddy wouldn't just
kill people.

471
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:07,057
He'd ruin their lives.

472
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,960
He said he liked to see
the look on their face

473
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:13,330
when they realized
they had nothing left.

474
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,800
What I'm doing here...

475
00:24:19,137 --> 00:24:23,540
I know it can't make up
for what...what he...

476
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:31,014
what <i>we</i> did, but I'm trying.

477
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:35,218
If Buddy is doing this,
he's targeting your patients.

478
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,420
So who else has access
to this office,

479
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:39,022
your notes,
your appointments?

480
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:41,558
Patients and staff
are in here all day.

481
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,527
If you had to pick one.

482
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:48,031
Uh...Tom, my assistant.

483
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:50,433
I'll check it out.
I'll come with.

484
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:52,869
Uh...

485
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:56,673
Fine. Whatever.

486
00:24:56,675 --> 00:25:06,916
?

487
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:16,793
?

488
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:21,564
All right,
stay in the car.

489
00:25:21,566 --> 00:25:24,300
Dean, I-I just --
I wanna help.

490
00:25:24,302 --> 00:25:28,705
Sam told me about the plan
for your mother.

491
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:34,010
Well, there's something
you should know.

492
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:36,646
Sam's plans don't always
work out.

493
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,084
Wait here.

494
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Yeah, yeah, no. I...
All right. Got it. Thanks.

495
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,863
What?

496
00:25:53,865 --> 00:25:56,733
Dean says
Tom is in the clear.

497
00:25:56,735 --> 00:25:58,234
How do you know?

498
00:25:58,236 --> 00:26:00,904
He, uh, he handed him
a silver dollar. Didn't burn.

499
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:01,668
Mm.

500
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:03,973
Turns out your assistant's
just a nice guy with five cats.

501
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,373
What are you doing?

502
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:08,427
I'm scrubbing your
security cam footage.

503
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:10,680
If anyone's eyes flare...
Then they're the shifter.

504
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:12,248
- Exactly.
- Right.

505
00:26:13,785 --> 00:26:15,719
So...tell me,

506
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:18,154
how exactly does this work
with your patients?

507
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:20,990
You show up as their dead
relatives, and they think what?

508
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:23,860
Honestly?
They don't really care.

509
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:27,030
They chalk it up
to hypnotism, a lucid dream.

510
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:28,832
They explain it away
because at the end of the day,

511
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,333
they get to say goodbye.

512
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:32,469
Hmm. And that works?

513
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:33,870
Mm-hmm.

514
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:37,674
People? We're hardwired
to want closure.

515
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:40,076
You know?

516
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:43,046
You never got a chance
to say goodbye either, did you?

517
00:26:48,286 --> 00:26:50,987
Whoa, whoa. Check this out.

518
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:52,956
There. Who's that?

519
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,557
That's John Driscoll.

520
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,860
I only started seeing him
a few weeks ago.

521
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:00,997
What did...

522
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:02,732
What did you do to me?

523
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:07,036
<i>I-I read your mind,</i>
<i>such as it is.</i>

524
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:14,677
What do you want?

525
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,248
<i>What do I want?</i>
<i>I want you to shut up.</i>

526
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,250
<i>I want -- Hmm.</i>

527
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:23,920
<i>Having you awake, it's like</i>
<i>a gnat flew right up here</i>

528
00:27:23,922 --> 00:27:26,823
<i>and it's trapped</i>
<i>and it's buzzing.</i>

529
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:30,226
Having me awake
causes you pain.

530
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:33,863
<i>If you can't sleep,</i>
<i>I can't sleep. Yeah?</i>

531
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:37,567
<i>And I like sleep.</i>
<i>I</i> need <i>sleep.</i>

532
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:39,035
Then get rid of me.

533
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:41,604
<i>Oh, I should, should I?</i>

534
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:43,673
Send me back to Earth.

535
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:48,144
<i>Or I throw you so deep</i>
<i>into the Empty</i>

536
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:51,247
<i>that you can't bother me</i>
<i>anymore, hmm?</i>

537
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:54,717
Except you know that won't work
or you would've done it already.

538
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,953
<i>Pretty smart.</i>

539
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:59,923
<i>Pretty smart, Dummy.</i>

540
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:02,125
Send...me...back.

541
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:03,860
That's not part of
the deal.

542
00:28:03,862 --> 00:28:07,163
Mnh-mnh. No, no. Besides,
you don't want to go back.

543
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:09,732
Yes, I do.

544
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:11,401
Sam and Dean need me.

545
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:15,271
Oh, save it.

546
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:18,942
I have tiptoed

547
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:21,878
through all
your little tulips.

548
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,415
Your memories,
your little feelings, yes.

549
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:27,584
I know what you hate.

550
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:29,886
I know who you love,

551
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:33,022
what you fear.

552
00:28:33,024 --> 00:28:37,961
There is nothing for you
back there. No.

553
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:41,431
Here.

554
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,900
Let me show you.

555
00:28:52,344 --> 00:29:00,583
?

556
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:03,152
Aah!

557
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,625
- Hey.
- Hi.

558
00:29:08,627 --> 00:29:10,360
Where's Sam?

559
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:12,996
Buddy's posing as
one of my patients.

560
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:14,831
Sam traced his phone.
I let him take my car.

561
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:17,400
He left
about 10 minutes ago.

562
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:20,203
He didn't call me.
Well, can you blame him?

563
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,010
Mia?

564
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,513
Could I talk to you?

565
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:34,350
Yes, of course. This way.

566
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:40,990
Sam and Dean aren't
my real brothers.

567
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,126
Sometimes we have to lie.

568
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:46,062
I'm still trying to
understand.

569
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:52,335
Come on, Sam. Pick up the phone.

570
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:54,304
My mother died when I was born.

571
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:01,311
<i>Hi, Jack. It's, uh...</i>

572
00:30:03,248 --> 00:30:04,847
I <i>'m your mom.</i>

573
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:08,818
I never met her.

574
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,187
I...

575
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:13,556
This is all I have.

576
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:15,291
And I just...

577
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:17,327
I need to...

578
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:20,096
see her, just once.

579
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,300
Please.

580
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:30,974
?

581
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:33,042
Shut your eyes.

582
00:30:35,814 --> 00:30:44,954
?

583
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:49,525
You can look now.

584
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,432
Mom?

585
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:59,535
Hi, Jack.

586
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:10,546
It's okay.

587
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:12,515
It's okay.

588
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:15,118
I'm afraid.

589
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:19,689
Why?

590
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:21,424
Why are you afraid?

591
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:25,395
Sam thinks you were right,
that -- that I'm good.

592
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:29,365
He wants me to believe it,
and I wanna believe it, too.

593
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,467
It's just, I...

594
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:37,907
I've hurt people.

595
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:41,411
I didn't mean to.
It was an accident.

596
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:46,115
And I know I should feel bad,
and I say I feel bad,

597
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:50,686
but most of the time,
I mostly...

598
00:31:50,688 --> 00:31:53,056
I don't feel anything.

599
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:55,691
And that's why I think
maybe...

600
00:31:58,596 --> 00:32:00,363
Maybe I'm a monster.

601
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:03,399
Jack.

602
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:06,135
It doesn't matter what
you are.

603
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:09,505
It matters what you do.

604
00:32:11,242 --> 00:32:14,811
And even monsters can do good
in this world.

605
00:32:18,316 --> 00:32:20,483
You really believe that?

606
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:24,120
I have to.

607
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:26,289
I have to.

608
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:31,527
?

609
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:33,996
Hmm.

610
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,304
Hey, what's up?

611
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:42,805
<i>Hey. I, uh, I was too late.</i>

612
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:45,441
<i>Shifter's gone.</i>
<i>Driscoll's dead.</i>

613
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:47,877
Damn it. All right.
Well, get back here.

614
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:50,646
Yeah, on my way.

615
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,016
Well, that was
too freakin' easy.

616
00:32:57,288 --> 00:33:07,530
?

617
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:11,200
Thank you.

618
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:13,069
I -- Thank you.

619
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:19,275
?

620
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:21,410
Dean?

621
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:29,385
?

622
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:43,900
?

623
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:49,405
?

624
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,444
Hey, baby.

625
00:34:02,037 --> 00:34:04,103
<i>Come on, Castiel!</i>

626
00:34:04,105 --> 00:34:05,905
<i>Wouldn't you rather be</i>
<i>a fond memory</i>

627
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:09,308
<i>than a constant, festering</i>
<i>disappointment?</i>

628
00:34:12,747 --> 00:34:15,014
<i>Just let's lay down.</i>

629
00:34:17,852 --> 00:34:20,887
<i>Let's just try and sleep.</i>

630
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,590
<i>Hmm? Think about it.</i>

631
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:27,093
<i>Infinite peace, yes?</i>

632
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,931
<i>No regrets.</i>

633
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:34,333
<i>No pain.</i>

634
00:34:35,737 --> 00:34:39,639
<i>Kiddo, save yourself.</i>

635
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:46,779
?

636
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:49,148
I'm already saved.

637
00:34:53,321 --> 00:34:56,355
You can prance

638
00:34:56,357 --> 00:34:59,292
and you can preen

639
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:02,462
and you can scream and yell

640
00:35:02,464 --> 00:35:06,466
and remind me of my failings
but somehow, I'm awake.

641
00:35:06,468 --> 00:35:10,236
And I will stay awake
and I will keep <i>you</i> awake

642
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:13,673
until we both go insane.

643
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:20,513
I will fight you.

644
00:35:20,515 --> 00:35:22,682
Fight you

645
00:35:22,684 --> 00:35:27,220
and fight you for...ever.

646
00:35:28,857 --> 00:35:31,324
For eternity.

647
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:34,694
<i>No.</i>

648
00:35:34,696 --> 00:35:36,329
<i>No.</i>

649
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:38,364
Release me.

650
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:47,473
Release...me.

651
00:35:51,913 --> 00:35:53,946
Buddy, what are you doing?

652
00:35:53,948 --> 00:35:55,348
- What am I doing?
- Yeah.

653
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,916
What am I doing?
What are <i>you</i> doing, huh?

654
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:58,584
You think you can just leave?

655
00:35:58,586 --> 00:36:01,387
Build this whole new life
for yourself without me, huh?

656
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:03,856
Kid.
Oh, you're up.

657
00:36:03,858 --> 00:36:05,558
Wait, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't hurt them.

658
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,161
Oh, begging for Hunters?
That's not my girl.

659
00:36:08,163 --> 00:36:08,964
I'm <i>not</i> your girl.

660
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:10,831
You always did think
you were too good for me,

661
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:12,331
even though I gave you
everything.

662
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,833
Jack.
You used me!

663
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:15,334
Yeah, well, welcome
to the world, sweetheart.

664
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:16,869
Everybody uses everybody.

665
00:36:16,871 --> 00:36:18,371
You gotta snap these cuffs.

666
00:36:18,373 --> 00:36:20,606
I never stopped looking for you.
I can't.

667
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,925
And when I found this place,
when I saw all that...

668
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:23,210
Yes, you can.

669
00:36:23,211 --> 00:36:25,044
warm, fuzzy good
you were doing...

670
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:26,445
I couldn't let you have that.

671
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:28,614
Sammy believes in you,
and when he believes,

672
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:29,949
he'll go Hell for leather...

673
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:33,386
So I took it all away,
and it <i>was</i> fun.

674
00:36:33,388 --> 00:36:36,255
...but you gotta try.
You're...

675
00:36:36,257 --> 00:36:37,723
you're a...

676
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:39,759
What? A monster?

677
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:41,794
Well, so are you.

678
00:36:41,796 --> 00:36:44,330
And it's about time
you embraced that.

679
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,599
So I'm not gonna kill
those boys.

680
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:48,668
You are.

681
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,571
You end them, or <i>you</i> die,

682
00:36:51,573 --> 00:36:54,874
courtesy of Tweedledee's
silver bullets.

683
00:36:54,876 --> 00:36:57,543
So what's it gonna be,
Princess?

684
00:36:57,545 --> 00:37:04,617
?

685
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:08,387
Shoot me.

686
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:11,290
Shoot me!

687
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:24,503
Look. Baby brother.

688
00:37:24,505 --> 00:37:27,106
No. No!

689
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:28,874
Stop!

690
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:31,444
Like shooting Hunters
in a barrel.

691
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:33,879
Sam, no!

692
00:37:35,316 --> 00:37:38,451
Dean?

693
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:40,853
<i>Sam!</i>

694
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:48,628
<i>- We're in here!</i>
- Stop.

695
00:37:55,737 --> 00:38:00,606
?

696
00:38:00,608 --> 00:38:06,779
No!

697
00:38:13,855 --> 00:38:15,721
Uhh!

698
00:38:15,723 --> 00:38:17,890
Aah!

699
00:38:22,664 --> 00:38:26,565
Uhh!

700
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:39,618
You sure about this?

701
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,288
What Buddy did was my fault.

702
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:46,391
I should've...

703
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:49,059
You guys can go.

704
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:52,145
I'll take care of him.

705
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:57,601
You know, I just -- I just
wanted to help people.

706
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:59,236
You did.

707
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:09,446
?

708
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:21,958
- Hey.
- ?Hey.

709
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:31,968
You did good today, Jack.

710
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:43,313
?

711
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:55,876
Listen, man,
back at, uh, Mia's,

712
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:59,196
I was out of line.

713
00:39:59,198 --> 00:40:01,832
I'm sorry for being a...

714
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,500
a dick lately.

715
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,088
Thanks.

716
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,727
And maybe you're right,

717
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:15,846
about the kid.

718
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:19,149
I mean, he tries.
I'll give him that.

719
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,351
And he tapped his powers,
saved our ass,

720
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:22,853
so that's a win.

721
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:25,238
Yeah. I guess.

722
00:40:27,442 --> 00:40:29,276
What's up?

723
00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:34,865
What if you're right?

724
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:37,784
About Mom.

725
00:40:37,786 --> 00:40:41,037
What if she is dead,
and I'm just in denial?

726
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:47,093
Don't say that.

727
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:49,596
What?

728
00:40:49,598 --> 00:40:52,048
You've been wanting me to
admit that since it happened.

729
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:56,052
I know I have,
but don't say that.

730
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,441
I need you to keep the faith,

731
00:41:01,443 --> 00:41:05,111
for both of us.

732
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:09,533
'Cause right now, I...

733
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:13,236
Right now, I don't believe
in a damn thing.

734
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:18,625
?

735
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:39,930
?

736
00:41:40,182 --> 00:41:46,353
?

737
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:55,695
?

738
