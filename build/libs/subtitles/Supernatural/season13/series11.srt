1
00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:03,192
Well, I'll be damned.

2
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:05,194
Huh?
Donna, what's shakin'?

3
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:07,864
We have a case to solve.

4
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:10,166
This is Officer Stover.
He's lead on the case.

5
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:12,201
Nice to meet ya.
Call me Doug.

6
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:13,936
Looks like somebody
might have a crush.

7
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:16,839
Okay, so now you're sure
it's vampires?

8
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:19,242
What the cuss?! A vampire?

9
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:20,710
I'm a monster.

10
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:22,111
We gotta deal with this
before I hurt somebody.

11
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:23,880
The cure is good.

12
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:26,182
Trickiest thing on the list --
blood of the fang who turned ya.

13
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:28,150
All right, give me
the damn cure.

14
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:31,821
- We don't scare them anymore.
- Says who?

15
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,522
Huh!

16
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,226
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about.

17
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,730
Hey.

18
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:42,265
- Yeah.
- Mmm!

19
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:44,000
- There we go.
- You betcha.

20
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:58,347
<i>?</i>

21
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,816
<i>? Look in my eyes ?</i>

22
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,055
<i>? And tell me you... ?</i>

23
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:10,660
<i>? Love me ?</i>

24
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:15,064
<i>? Tell me you love me ?</i>

25
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:19,602
<i>? Or, darling, I'll be gone ?</i>

26
00:01:19,604 --> 00:01:23,039
<i>? Gone, gone, gone ?</i>

27
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,540
Please!

28
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,875
Please, no, no, no!

29
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,678
No, please! No!
<i>? Ooh ?</i>

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,814
No! Aah!

31
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:38,587
<i>?</i>

32
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,280
<i>Card declined.</i>

33
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:07,583
<i>Card declined.</i>
<i>Please see cashier.</i>

34
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,385
Of course.

35
00:02:11,022 --> 00:02:14,757
If I regard wickedness
in my heart,

36
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,193
the Lord will not hear me.

37
00:02:17,195 --> 00:02:18,594
<i>Psalms --</i>

38
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:22,131
It's not just poetry.

39
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,247
Hey. Um, excuse me.
Your card thing is broken.

40
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:40,750
Tried it a couple times,
but it's not working.

41
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:44,954
Here.

42
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,622
I.D., too.

43
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:51,961
Hmm.

44
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:56,899
Hanscum.

45
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,934
That's kinda funny.

46
00:02:58,936 --> 00:02:59,737
Old English.

47
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:01,904
Kind of reminds me
of soap scum or --

48
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,439
Can I just get $30 on 2?

49
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:05,341
Why don't you smile some?

50
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:07,376
You can get whatever
you want, darlin'.

51
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,682
Hmm.

52
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:35,004
?

53
00:03:35,273 --> 00:03:43,112
?

54
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,217
Wash your windows?

55
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,786
No, I -- No. No, thanks.

56
00:03:50,788 --> 00:04:01,030
?

57
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,200
?

58
00:04:15,446 --> 00:04:17,980
Come on.

59
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,259
Hey. Hey!

60
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:32,027
You suck!

61
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:44,240
?

62
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:57,086
Oh!

63
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:01,023
No. No, no.

64
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:02,391
No!

Yeah. All right. Yeah.

Ho, ho, ho. There he is.

72
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:00,115
Saved you a short stack.

73
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:02,184
Hey, Donna, I'm here with Dean.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

74
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:03,786
Uh, why don't you tell him
what you told me?

75
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:05,221
<i>Oh.</i>

76
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:08,457
It's my niece.
She's gone missing.

77
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:11,660
<i>And the local cops don't...</i>

78
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,665
I know it's not
your normal thing,

79
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,179
<i>but...</i>

80
00:06:17,203 --> 00:06:19,102
Text us the address.
We're on our way.

81
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:20,836
<i>Thank you.</i>

82
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:37,319
?

83
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:42,691
?

84
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:53,369
?

85
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,371
Hey, Donna.

86
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,673
Hey.

87
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:59,541
How you holding up?

88
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,944
Oh, you know...not great.

89
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:04,246
Yeah.

90
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:05,914
I'm sorry for calling you guys,

91
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,916
but Jody's got her hands full
with the girls.

92
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,553
Hey, never apologize
for calling us.

93
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:13,289
So what do we know?

94
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:17,893
Uh, staties found her car
side of the road.

95
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,828
Signs of a struggle.

96
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,897
And what was she doing
out here?

97
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,400
She was taking a gap year.
It's, like, this thing where --

98
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,269
Take a year off, run wild
before you go to college?

99
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:29,505
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

100
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:32,574
I used to tell her about how
much fun I had when I did it.

101
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:37,012
Well, she thought that
sounded like an adventure.

102
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:39,148
She thought...
Donna, hey.

103
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,583
Whatever happened,
it's not your fault.

104
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:47,222
That's what Doug keeps
telling me, but...

105
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:48,724
I can't help
but think --

106
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:50,392
Just focus on the case.

107
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:54,129
Doug here?

108
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:57,366
Yeah, he's in there,
talking to the locals.

109
00:07:57,368 --> 00:07:59,868
I'll go check in.

110
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:14,883
?

111
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:17,586
Excuse me! Hey!

112
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:19,555
What are you doin'?

113
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:21,457
Oh, I, um...

114
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,159
I asked you a question, son.

115
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:26,562
First off, I'm not your son.
Second --

116
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:28,430
Whoa, whoa, easy.

117
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:32,634
Agent Clegg,
this is Agent Savage, FBI.

118
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:35,270
Oh. Company man.

119
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:37,272
Wow, you should've told me.

120
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:38,774
Well, I didn't get a chance.

121
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:40,409
Uh-huh.

122
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:41,910
And what field office
are you out of?

123
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,412
I'm just curious
who I should call

124
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:45,280
about you walking through
my crime scene.

125
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,484
Mm.

126
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,519
I think we got off on
the wrong foot.

127
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:54,089
Uh, I'm not here
on official business.

128
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:57,259
The victim, she's family.

129
00:08:57,261 --> 00:09:00,329
She's my cousin, so I'm just
here to get some answers.

130
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,132
Oh.

131
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,733
I can respect that.

132
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:06,902
All right, come on,
I'll fill you in.

133
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:09,438
Yeah.
Sorry.

134
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,173
You and Donna are related?

135
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,742
Yeah.

136
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:16,378
So you were in Sioux Falls
a couple of weeks ago

137
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,281
at the family reunion.

138
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:21,583
I was there.
Yeah.

139
00:09:21,585 --> 00:09:23,619
Donna said it was
a pretty wild time.

140
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:26,588
It was wild. Absolutely.

141
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,324
Ha.

142
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:31,827
?

143
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:33,295
Now this is where
we found it.

144
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:34,997
This is an older stretch
of highway,

145
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,665
mostly used
by long-haul truckers.

146
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,233
There's no patrols
to stop the speeders.

147
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:39,701
So who found the car?

148
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:41,703
Troopers got
an anonymous tip.

149
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,138
Well, that's convenient.

150
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,299
Yeah, fits with
the pattern, though.

151
00:09:44,323 --> 00:09:45,542
Pattern?

152
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,376
They think it's part
of something bigger.

153
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,479
And Wendy's not the only one.

154
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:52,214
We found evidence that suggests
she was targeted

155
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,615
by a serial abductor.

156
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:55,350
Now that spike we found
on the tire,

157
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:56,718
that's classic Butterfly.

158
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,420
Sorry. Butterfly?

159
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:00,289
That's what we call him --
what <i>I</i> call him.

160
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,424
He's got kind of
a migrating pattern.

161
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:05,294
Now in the winter,
he makes his way southward,

162
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:07,095
targeting people that are
traveling alone,

163
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:08,897
people who won't be missed.
Then in the summer,

164
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,000
he turns around
and he heads back up north.

165
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,569
Now what about the victims?

166
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,406
Go on.

167
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,876
They disappear.

168
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,047
We've never even found
a body.

169
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:33,055
So maybe they aren't,
you know, <i>gone</i> gone.

170
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:37,359
Maybe.

171
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:39,862
Look, having you all here is not
standard operating procedure,

172
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:42,064
but if you wanna help...

173
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:44,366
Now, I've been chasing
this psycho

174
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:45,834
for the last 12 years.

175
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:47,803
I could use all the help
I can get.

176
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:53,041
?

177
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:54,610
We're in.

178
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:01,250
No one uses
CB radios anymore.

179
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:04,086
<i>All that smokey saw</i>
<i>was my rubbers.</i>

180
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:06,154
No one except truckers.

181
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,523
Breaker, breaker 1-9,

182
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:10,259
this is 67,
the Midnight Rider.

183
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:13,195
Looking for the 4-1-1
on my Alice in Wonderland.

184
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:14,763
<i>Whoa, ho, Midnight Rider.</i>

185
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:17,099
<i>Sound like that piece</i>
<i>ran out on you.</i>

186
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:20,836
She's redhead,
brown sedan. She's family.

187
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,973
Breaker, breaker. Anyone?

188
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,542
<i>Hot diggity.</i>
<i>I'll find your Alice.</i>

189
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,410
<i>- She'll be my family, too.</i>

190
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:30,812
<i>Not if I get there first.</i>
You see?

191
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:33,916
Told you.

192
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:35,784
This is stupid.

193
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:38,053
It'll work. Dad used it
all the time.

194
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:39,788
This isn't even
our kind of case.

195
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,925
And you know, with the real Feds
here, we should back down.

196
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:44,293
You're joking, right?

197
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:46,595
- We're still fugitives.
- They think we're dead.

198
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:49,965
Do you really wanna get on
the FBI's radar again?

199
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:51,800
Okay, so what do you
wanna do? Hmm?

200
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:53,869
Wanna call up Donna and say,
“Hey, sorry about your niece.

201
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:55,837
These kinds of things happen.
Later.”

202
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,472
And head back to the bunker
so you can mope some more?

203
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:58,907
I'm not moping.

204
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,676
You got up at 10:00 a.m.
this morning.

205
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,277
10:00 a.m.

206
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,747
You, Mr. Rise
and Freakin' Shine.

207
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:07,950
And then you turned down
pancakes.

208
00:12:07,952 --> 00:12:10,552
I wasn't hungry.

209
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:13,221
They're pancakes. Y--

210
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:18,894
Look, I know you're in
a dark place right now, okay?

211
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:22,297
I mean, we lost Jack.
Mom is...

212
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:25,500
I think about 'em, too.
All the time.

213
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:27,469
But you can't
let it eat you up.

214
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:29,271
Now look, when I was --
when I was broken up,

215
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:31,373
you were there for me.
Well, I'm here for you now.

216
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,444
And I'm telling you, the only
way out of this is through.

217
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:37,012
Now when everything goes
to hell, what do we do?

218
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:38,447
We put our heads down
and we do the work.

219
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:41,216
We'll find Jack.
We'll save Mom, we will.

220
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,718
But right now,
Donna needs our help.

221
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,319
<i>Breaker, breaker, Midnight Rider.</i>
Okay?

222
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:46,288
<i>Felix the Cat here.</i>

223
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,789
<i>Breaker, breaker,</i>
<i>Midnight Rider.</i>

224
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,224
<i>Felix the Cat here.</i>

225
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,694
<i>I, uh, think I got</i>
<i>somethin' for ya.</i>

226
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,765
10-4, Felix.
What do you got?

227
00:12:56,767 --> 00:13:00,002
<i>Better we talk live and in</i>
<i>color. You mind meeting up?</i>

228
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:02,337
<i>There's, uh, there's a place</i>
<i>off Gold Rush Byway,</i>

229
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,339
<i>just past mile marker 980.</i>

230
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:05,807
<i>I'll roll through around noon.</i>

231
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:07,909
It's a date. Over.

232
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:10,612
All right.

233
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:12,347
I'll go check that out
tomorrow.

234
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:14,783
Why don't you hang back in case
something else breaks?

235
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,420
Okay. Look...

236
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:23,358
Obviously, I'm here
for Donna, all right?

237
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,960
I wanna help.

238
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:27,162
I know you do.

239
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:29,331
So let's find
this son of a bitch.

240
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:38,340
<i>?</i>

241
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:41,677
<i>? I'm in love with you ?</i>

242
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,213
<i>? And I'm crazy 'bout</i>
<i>the things you do ?</i>

243
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:48,684
<i>? You're more to me</i>
<i>than any pot of gold ?</i>

244
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:53,689
<i>? You make me feel good</i>
<i>deep in my soul ?</i>

245
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,726
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me...

246
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:00,028
Please. Please.
Please let me go.

247
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,764
Please. Please let me go.
Please. Why?

248
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,933
Why are yo ]

249
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:07,536
<i>? Oh, sweetheart,</i>
<i>a girl like you ?</i>

250
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:08,904
What are you...

251
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:10,472
<i>? And if you ever</i>
<i>depart from me ?</i>

252
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,840
Please, help me.

253
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:14,976
<i>? I'll live on in misery ?</i>

254
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:16,543
<i>? I can't believe</i>
<i>that you're for real ?</i>

255
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:19,915
<i>? Because,</i>
<i>because you give... ?</i>

256
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,450
Help me.

257
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:24,219
Help me, someone!
Help me, please!

258
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:26,488
<i>? Whoa ?</i>

259
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,023
Please, help me!

260
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:32,515
Now we subpoenaed
your niece's credit cards

261
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,317
so we can retrace
her steps.

262
00:14:35,654 --> 00:14:37,620
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

263
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:42,892
Uh, what's this?

264
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:46,196
That is the last 12 years
of my life.

265
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:47,597
Right there is
every person

266
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,365
we think got taken
by the Butterfly.

267
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,234
Really?
Like I was telling Donna,

268
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:52,735
the last place
that we can put Wendy

269
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:55,205
is at a gas station
in Oshkosh, Nebraska.

270
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:56,639
Now based on
the Butterfly's pattern,

271
00:14:56,641 --> 00:14:58,608
I have a short list
of suspects that I like,

272
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,176
but there's one guy in
particular I've always liked

273
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:02,445
more than the others.
You ever bring him in?

274
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:06,549
No. Could never get
anything concrete to link up.

275
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:09,519
Until now.
You see, that night...

276
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:11,421
he was there, too.

277
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:17,760
?

278
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:19,095
That's your guy?

279
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:22,131
Pastor “Diamond” Don Hankey.

280
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,733
Road preacher.

281
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:25,802
Ministers to truckers,
mostly.

282
00:15:25,804 --> 00:15:29,772
Don't let his squeaky clean
act fool you, though.

283
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:31,341
He's got a jacket.

284
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:34,444
Arrests for lewd behavior,
couple drunk and disorderlies.

285
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:36,145
Thank you
for your service, son.

286
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:39,082
And when we picked him up...

287
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:42,785
we found this.

288
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:44,821
That's Wendy's.

289
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:53,663
?

290
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:55,565
So this girl of yours...

291
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,233
Mm, you saw her
that night?

292
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:59,969
Yeah. Twice.

293
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:02,539
Usually, I-I try to stay out
of this sort of stuff.

294
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,208
I just run my route
and keep out of trouble.

295
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,511
But...
that night, that girl...

296
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:14,884
Like I said,
I saw her twice --

297
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:19,088
uh, once at a station
off Highway 26

298
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,659
and then later, I was
driving off Road 88 and...

299
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:24,827
<i>Hey. Hey!</i>

300
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:31,968
I shouldn't have
left her there.

301
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,940
But, um, I was running behind
schedule and I just...

302
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:40,410
Well, it's the only reason
I even gassed up there.

303
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:42,812
That place
gives me the creeps.

304
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:44,747
And what's
this place called?

305
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:46,416
Manny's Truck Stop Cafe.

306
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:50,720
<i>The other night --</i>
<i>we can put you there.</i>

307
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:53,456
<i>I go where my ministry</i>
<i>takes me.</i>

308
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:01,631
You know her?

309
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,566
Her name is Wendy Hanscum.

310
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:06,603
<i>Recent high school grad.</i>
<i>Popular.</i>

311
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,338
<i>She had her whole life</i>
<i>ahead of her.</i>

312
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:11,908
No?

313
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,079
What about him?

314
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:18,147
Luis Fernando.

315
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:20,116
He had a family.

316
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:21,985
They're both missing.

317
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:26,589
The girl looks
vaguely familiar.

318
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:28,958
I've never laid eyes
on the immigrant.

319
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,227
Wow. Nice.

320
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:33,129
Okay, let's focus
on the girl, then.

321
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:35,131
Lawyer.

322
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:38,001
Excuse me?
I know my rights.

323
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:43,272
Do you think I give
a tinker's damn

324
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,608
about your rights?

325
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,045
I don't care what you
or your goon think.

326
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:52,949
I know my rights,
so get me a lawyer. Now.

327
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,085
Then you can ask me
anything you like

328
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:58,054
about your illegal
and your whore.

329
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,689
Tough guy, huh?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

330
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:03,660
Hey, hey, hey! Agent, Agent,
Agent, Agent. Agent, please.

331
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:05,662
Mind if I talk to him?

332
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:14,303
?

333
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:15,672
Thanks for coming.

334
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:18,508
Got that report
you asked for.

335
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,944
Everything that's gone down at
Manny's Truck Stop Cafe lately.

336
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:25,014
- And?
- Couple of D&Ds,

337
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:28,017
four counts of
public urination, but...

338
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,919
Nothing that screams
secret hunting ground

339
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:32,689
for a kidnapper.
Not exactly.

340
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,862
Can I ask you a question?
About Donna?

341
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,100
Okay.

342
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:46,836
Is she gonna be okay?

343
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:48,571
I mean, I love Donna,

344
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:52,141
but I've only known her for
a couple years, and this...

345
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:54,343
I've never seen her
like this.

346
00:18:56,614 --> 00:18:58,548
I'm not sure what you mean.

347
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,384
I mean, she's barely talkin'
to me, and we always talk.

348
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:04,253
About the Vikes,
about the Real Housewives,

349
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:05,855
about everything.

350
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:12,495
This is a tough time,
I know, but...

351
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:16,065
I think she's hiding
something from me.

352
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,034
Anyhoo, forget it.

353
00:19:18,036 --> 00:19:19,535
It's probably nothing.

354
00:19:19,537 --> 00:19:23,573
I'm probably just spinning.
It's nothing.

355
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:27,677
Doug, you're a good guy.

356
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,612
And you're gonna be there
for Donna.

357
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:30,980
You betcha.

358
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:34,450
So, you know, just...
trust her.

359
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:36,085
Okay?

360
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,793
I said I want my lawyer.

361
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:46,129
You sure?

362
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:49,398
I mean, the Bible doesn't have
much good to say about them.

363
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:52,969
“But the Pharisees
and the lawyers

364
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:55,872
“rejected God's purpose
for themselves,

365
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:58,608
not having been baptized
by John.”

366
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,977
You know your scripture.

367
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:03,279
Even the good book's
got lawyer jokes.

368
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:05,848
I know what you're doin'.

369
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,817
And I want --
Lawyer. Yeah, yeah.

370
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:10,820
Okay, but here's the thing.

371
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:14,557
This is a small town.

372
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,593
And it's Friday night.
You know?

373
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:20,229
So if you're lucky,

374
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:24,033
they might be able to get you
a public defender by Monday.

375
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:25,635
Maybe.

376
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:28,471
Which means you get to spend
at least two nights

377
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:30,740
in the big cell.

378
00:20:30,742 --> 00:20:33,910
Just you and a bunch of guys
who...

379
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:36,279
well, look at you

380
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:39,949
and all they're gonna see
is Sunday dinner.

381
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:45,855
So...if you wanna deal
with that? Super.

382
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:48,791
Or...

383
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,630
You can answer
a few questions,

384
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:57,867
and I can
get you outta here.

385
00:20:57,869 --> 00:20:59,235
Your call.

386
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,571
She's good.

387
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:03,306
Yeah, she is.

388
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:08,845
Windows? Oil?

389
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:13,883
How about a girl?

390
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:18,254
Have you seen her?

391
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:20,056
May have.

392
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:22,892
Mm-hmm.

393
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:26,529
Keep talking.

394
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:31,601
She was in
a couple nights ago.

395
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:32,935
Marlon liked her.

396
00:21:32,937 --> 00:21:35,238
Marlon?
He's the cashier.

397
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,940
After she left, he closed up
early and drove off after her.

398
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:39,575
Didn't come back till dawn.

399
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,711
Uh-huh.

400
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:44,847
How long you been
on the road?

401
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:48,017
Oh, a <i>long</i> time.

402
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:49,652
Maybe 12 years, you'd say?

403
00:21:49,654 --> 00:21:51,120
Yeah, could be.

404
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:53,189
You just travel
all over, huh?

405
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:55,024
Across God's green Earth.

406
00:21:55,026 --> 00:21:58,027
?

407
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:01,197
You a family man, Pastor?

408
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:03,266
Married, two kids.

409
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:07,203
They know about that girl
you flashed outside Cheyenne?

410
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,173
How 'bout that teenage boy

411
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:12,742
says you picked him up
hitchhiking?

412
00:22:12,744 --> 00:22:14,610
I'm weak.

413
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:17,079
I am made of flesh.

414
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:19,115
Oh.

415
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:20,716
That's your excuse?

416
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:24,353
God knows I'm a sinner.
And my wife, she knows, too.

417
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:26,155
We're working through it.

418
00:22:26,157 --> 00:22:27,990
Yeah?

419
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:32,328
She know about this?

420
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,900
Belongs to my niece.
What did you do with her?

421
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:41,103
I don't...

422
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:42,571
That's not...

423
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:45,574
We found it in your van.

424
00:22:45,576 --> 00:22:48,177
You hurt her, right?
No. No, no, no, no.

425
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,812
You made her bleed.
No.

426
00:22:49,814 --> 00:22:52,081
Don't lie to me.

427
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,516
No, I'm not.

428
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:55,251
Don't lie to God!

429
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:56,953
I'm not.

430
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:03,426
I've done wrong, but I've
never hurt anybody.

431
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:05,127
Never.

432
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:10,166
Please,
you have to believe me. Please.

433
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:14,670
Please.

434
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:22,812
I believe him.

435
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:26,282
Yeah, so do I.
But the shirt...

436
00:23:26,284 --> 00:23:29,251
Yeah, the shirt doesn't
make any sense. I mean, what?

437
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:32,221
I'm -- I'm a criminal mastermind
that avoids capture for 12 years

438
00:23:32,223 --> 00:23:34,390
and when I'm finally arrested,
there's a blood shirt in my van

439
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:35,858
that links me
to one of the victims?

440
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,094
It's too easy.
So someone planted it.

441
00:23:38,096 --> 00:23:39,462
Definitely possible.

442
00:23:39,464 --> 00:23:43,132
I mean, maybe back at
the truck stop?

443
00:23:43,134 --> 00:23:46,335
But if it's not
the Pastor, who is it?

444
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,439
Where is she?

445
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:56,245
Mmm.

446
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:57,847
I don't know.

447
00:23:57,849 --> 00:23:59,248
Dean, what are you --

448
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,883
It's how we do things
in the FBI.

449
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:02,485
It is?

450
00:24:02,487 --> 00:24:05,187
Try again.
I said I don't --

451
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:07,990
Look, I know you saw her

452
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:09,792
and I know you went after her.

453
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:11,327
So where is she?

454
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:14,163
You won't believe it.

455
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:16,699
Try me.

456
00:24:19,771 --> 00:24:25,975
?

457
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:37,887
What? What's that?

458
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:42,892
It's like eBay.

459
00:24:42,894 --> 00:24:44,927
Kinda.

460
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:51,300
<i>No!</i>

461
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:54,070
<i>No!</i>
They're selling him off.

462
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:55,771
Piece by piece.

463
00:24:55,773 --> 00:24:58,741
<i>Somebody!</i>

464
00:24:58,743 --> 00:25:01,777
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

465
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:05,014
<i>Oh, god, please!</i>

466
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:07,917
<i>Help me!</i>

467
00:25:12,735 --> 00:25:14,234
So it ended
about 30 minutes ago.

468
00:25:14,236 --> 00:25:16,937
Show 'em how it started.

469
00:25:18,374 --> 00:25:21,708
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

470
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,745
<i>Oh, god, please!</i>
Hey, come on.

471
00:25:24,747 --> 00:25:26,313
<i>Help --</i>

472
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:28,382
Aw. What's the matter?

473
00:25:28,384 --> 00:25:29,683
You vegan?

474
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:31,885
Ah.

475
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:34,087
How they do it in the FBI.

476
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,526
Who'd do this,
buy pieces of people?

477
00:25:39,528 --> 00:25:40,994
For what? Trophies?

478
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:43,096
No. It's for food.

479
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:44,498
Look at the comments.

480
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,167
“Yum.” “Tasty.”
“Can't wait to get my delivery”"

481
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:49,536
It's takeout for --
Monsters.

482
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:51,071
What?

483
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:53,874
We'll talk about it later.

484
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:55,709
What's there to talk about?

485
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:57,911
Where does this
broadcast from?

486
00:25:57,913 --> 00:25:59,713
I don't know. Got me.

487
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,548
- I mean, I don't run the thing.
- I just...

488
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,085
Look, I see someone I think
nobody's gonna miss,

489
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:07,421
I send a message,
I get paid.

490
00:26:07,423 --> 00:26:08,889
And you feel good about that?

491
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:11,625
No, but, you know,
like you don't got bills?

492
00:26:11,627 --> 00:26:13,827
Guys, guys, look at this.

493
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:20,434
<i>Please. If anybody's</i>
<i>watching this...please.</i>

494
00:26:20,436 --> 00:26:22,235
<i>Please help me.</i>
Oh, God.

495
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:27,507
?

496
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:29,543
Okay, can you -- can you --
can you hack into it

497
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:31,345
and find out where she is?

498
00:26:31,347 --> 00:26:32,946
I don't know, Dean.

499
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:34,781
This feed's on
an encrypted TOR server.

500
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:36,316
I mean,
this is dark web stuff.

501
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:37,918
Even if I could crack it,
it would take days.

502
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,187
Okay, well, you got 58 minutes.
I can't do it.

503
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:43,256
Then who can?
The FBI.

504
00:26:44,893 --> 00:26:46,560
So you're sayin'...

505
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:48,628
monsters are real?

506
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,098
Pretty much.

507
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,900
Those guys, they're not
related to you, are they?

508
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:56,803
They're Hunters.
They kill monsters.

509
00:26:58,273 --> 00:27:00,173
And so do I.

510
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:03,944
Sometimes.

511
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:05,679
Hey. We gotta roll.

512
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:08,415
Clegg's got a 20 on that video
feed, and we got 42 minutes.

513
00:27:13,122 --> 00:27:17,090
?

514
00:27:17,092 --> 00:27:18,558
This is it.

515
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,360
You head around back.
we'll take the front.

516
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:30,604
?

517
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:35,742
?

518
00:27:35,744 --> 00:27:38,478
All clear.

519
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,317
?

520
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,220
You okay hanging back?

521
00:27:47,222 --> 00:27:49,122
Someone's gotta watch him.

522
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:50,624
Dougie,
we'll figure this out

523
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:52,859
when we get back
to Stillwater, okay?

524
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:54,528
Here.

525
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:58,799
20 minutes. Let's go.

526
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:06,406
?

527
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:08,675
- What are you doing here?
- You called me.

528
00:28:08,677 --> 00:28:10,977
I called you for an address,
not for backup.

529
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:12,379
So you send me a link to
a website that sells people,

530
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:13,980
you don't expect me
to show up?

531
00:28:13,982 --> 00:28:16,249
Look, I don't know
what the hell's going on here,

532
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:17,918
but I've been hunting
the Butterfly a long time.

533
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,486
Now I need
to see this through.

534
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:23,957
All right, follow me.

535
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:26,159
Lady sheriff's pretty hot.

536
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:30,363
You two a thing? 'Cause, <i>man,</i>
she is way out of your league.

537
00:28:30,365 --> 00:28:32,399
Shut up.

538
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:38,071
<i>?</i>

539
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:42,642
<i>?</i>

540
00:28:42,644 --> 00:28:44,311
No.

541
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:45,412
No.

542
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:47,147
<i>? Yeah ?</i>

543
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:48,648
Please, please,
just let me go.

544
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,116
Please, you don't have
to do this.

545
00:28:50,118 --> 00:28:52,619
Please!
Please, just let me go.

546
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:54,521
<i>? Yeah ?</i>

547
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:56,089
No!

548
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:58,158
<i>? There's a flame, a flame ?</i>

549
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,161
<i>? A big flame in my heart ?</i>

550
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:03,663
<i>? Yeah, yeah, yeah ?</i>

551
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:06,366
<i>? And believe me</i>
<i>when I say ?</i>

552
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:08,902
<i>?</i>

553
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:12,372
<i>? Yeah, yeah, yeah ?</i>

554
00:29:14,843 --> 00:29:22,983
<i>?</i>

555
00:29:22,985 --> 00:29:24,551
<i>? I do ?</i>

556
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:27,387
<i>? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>yeah, yeah ?</i>

557
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:30,524
<i>? Yeah, oh, ho ?</i>

558
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:33,126
Hey.

559
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:37,097
Remember what they said
about monsters?

560
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:39,099
Fun fact --

561
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:41,601
I am one.

562
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:43,970
Vampire, actually.

563
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:50,944
?

564
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:56,716
?

565
00:29:56,718 --> 00:29:58,418
Let's have some fun.

566
00:30:05,694 --> 00:30:07,193
?

567
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:09,496
One...

568
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:12,766
Doug!

569
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:17,003
What happened? Where's Marlon?
Hold on.

570
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:19,973
Just hold on. You're gonna
be okay. Where are you hurt?

571
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:23,109
I'm not hurt, but...

572
00:30:27,883 --> 00:30:31,084
?

573
00:30:31,086 --> 00:30:34,187
I don't think I'm okay.

574
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:39,368
Oh, Doug. Oh, god.

575
00:30:39,392 --> 00:30:40,392
I'm hungry.

576
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:42,398
- Okay.
- I'm so hungry.

577
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,667
Aah! Aah!

578
00:30:45,537 --> 00:30:47,370
Doug!

579
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:50,774
Is he...

580
00:30:50,776 --> 00:30:52,275
A vamp. Yeah.

581
00:30:52,277 --> 00:30:54,277
Oh, god.
Yeah.

582
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,812
The change -- sometimes it's
fast, sometimes it's slow,

583
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,747
just depends
on the person.

584
00:30:57,749 --> 00:30:59,182
I just shot him up with
some Dead Man's Blood.

585
00:30:59,184 --> 00:31:00,717
He should be knocked out
for a while.

586
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:02,853
Oh, jeez.

587
00:31:02,855 --> 00:31:04,321
He'll be okay.

588
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:05,856
You call this okay?

589
00:31:05,858 --> 00:31:07,324
Look,
he just got turned, okay?

590
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:08,725
Which means that
he hasn't fed,

591
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:10,827
which means that there is a cure.
Huh?

592
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:12,696
We just need to mix up some
sage, a little bit of garlic --

593
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:16,299
And you need the bloodsucker
who turned him.

594
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:18,668
Well, thanks for making it
easy for me.

595
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,837
You never even
saw it comin'.

596
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,306
He got you.

597
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:26,276
He who?
Clegg, man.

598
00:31:27,946 --> 00:31:29,779
He's got your brother.

599
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:32,015
Where?

600
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,050
Oh. Wouldn't you like
to know.

601
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:37,220
Shouldn't have been
so rough with me.

602
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,924
I hold a grudge.

603
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,561
Well...

604
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:46,129
Bring it, Twilight.

605
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:49,266
Aah!

606
00:31:55,841 --> 00:32:00,377
You, get his blood
and mix that cure.

607
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:03,680
And <i>you...</i>

608
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:05,015
Where's Clegg?

609
00:32:05,017 --> 00:32:07,484
I tell you,
you'll kill me.

610
00:32:07,486 --> 00:32:09,586
Oh, I'm killing ya
either way.

611
00:32:09,588 --> 00:32:13,957
You just gotta decide
if you want it fast or slow.

612
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:18,762
No, no, no. Get further
back with that.

613
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:22,866
He's a big boy. We need him on
a <i>wide</i> lens.

614
00:32:24,036 --> 00:32:25,435
You...

615
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:28,939
You're the Butterfly.

616
00:32:28,941 --> 00:32:30,640
And you're Sam Winchester.

617
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:32,409
You and your brother are famous.

618
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:35,912
Hell, soon as I saw that
fancy car, I knew who you were.

619
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:37,814
And I knew you'd be trouble.

620
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:40,483
Tried to give you that preacher,
but you saw right through that.

621
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:43,587
So now it's on to Plan B.

622
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:47,257
Why are you doing this?

623
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:50,393
Well, 'cause somebody has to.

624
00:32:50,395 --> 00:32:53,296
How many monsters do you think
are out there, Sam?

625
00:32:53,298 --> 00:32:57,267
You know, if you --
you had to guess.

626
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:59,569
Hundreds. Thousands.

627
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:05,141
Ah. Add a zero.
Actually, add two.

628
00:33:05,143 --> 00:33:07,077
See, those freaks that you
and your brother chase,

629
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,312
those are just the ones
that can't pass,

630
00:33:09,314 --> 00:33:12,649
either because they're too mean
or they're too stupid,

631
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:14,284
or both.

632
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:16,286
But <i>most</i> monsters...

633
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,855
hell, they could be
your next door neighbor.

634
00:33:18,857 --> 00:33:20,657
They work a regular job,

635
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:23,426
mow the lawns on
a Saturday.

636
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:27,097
And they need to eat,
which is where I come in.

637
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:29,032
So you sell them people.

638
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:33,536
I sell them people
other people won't miss.

639
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:36,773
And because I do that,
I save lives.

640
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:40,277
If my customers didn't
have me...

641
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:42,279
then all those
hungry, hungry hippos

642
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:45,382
would be out there
huntin' and killin'.

643
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:47,851
And you couldn't stop 'em.

644
00:33:47,853 --> 00:33:50,520
No one could.

645
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:53,723
You should be thanking me.

646
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:55,091
Huh.

647
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:58,194
Yeah. All right.
Go to Hell.

648
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,165
Mm.
I'll see you there.

649
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,167
Now I know you've been
stalling because you think

650
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,736
Dean's gonna show up,
but...

651
00:34:06,738 --> 00:34:09,973
Sorry, kid. It's showtime.

652
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:13,510
?

653
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:20,083
?

654
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:23,853
?

655
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,455
Ladies and gentlemen,

656
00:34:25,457 --> 00:34:27,757
<i>we interrupt your regularly</i>
<i>scheduled program</i>

657
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:31,061
<i>to bring you something</i>
<i>truly special --</i>

658
00:34:31,063 --> 00:34:32,529
<i>a new auction.</i>

659
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,097
<i>Introducing...</i>

660
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:37,067
Mr. Sam Winchester!

661
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:40,270
?

662
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:45,975
This...
it's gonna work, right?

663
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:47,977
It worked on me.

664
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:52,282
Okay.

665
00:34:52,284 --> 00:34:54,551
There you go.

666
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:55,852
There you go.

667
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:58,121
?

668
00:34:58,123 --> 00:35:00,323
<i>$5,000 for the liver.</i>
<i>Going once...</i>

669
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:01,725
<i>going twice...</i>

670
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,326
Sold!

671
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:06,830
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

672
00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:08,898
let's begin the auction

673
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,602
for Sam Winchester's heart!

674
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:22,112
?

675
00:35:26,318 --> 00:35:36,559
?

676
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:47,137
?

677
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,306
Wendy!

678
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,610
Aunt Donna?

679
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:54,811
?

680
00:35:56,481 --> 00:36:02,952
?

681
00:36:11,997 --> 00:36:15,198
?

682
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,834
<i>$50,000. Do I have $60,000?</i>

683
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:20,437
$60,000? $60,000, yes!

684
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:21,971
Do I have $65,000?

685
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:23,973
Look at that jump! $100,000!

686
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:27,610
<i>Folks, there are many pieces</i>
<i>to Sam Winchester...</i>

687
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:29,646
<i>but only one heart.</i>

688
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:32,816
Look at that! $500,000!

689
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,584
$500,000 going once...

690
00:36:34,586 --> 00:36:35,919
going twice...

691
00:36:35,921 --> 00:36:37,787
Sold!

692
00:36:39,524 --> 00:36:46,362
?

693
00:36:46,364 --> 00:36:49,332
Usually, we do this
next part kinda slow,

694
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,434
so you can feel it,

695
00:36:51,436 --> 00:36:54,204
but since
Dean's out there...

696
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:56,840
quick and dirty.

697
00:36:58,777 --> 00:37:01,711
Say goodbye, Sam.

698
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:18,928
Show's over.

699
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:29,094
Oh, jeez.

700
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:30,495
Dougie Bear?

701
00:37:30,497 --> 00:37:32,530
Are you okay?

702
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:35,233
I...

703
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:37,268
You feel like you wanna
bite any of us?

704
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,038
Not really.

705
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,841
All right.
Then I guess it worked.

706
00:37:45,212 --> 00:37:47,979
W-Wendy?

707
00:37:47,981 --> 00:37:50,782
She's safe.
She's at a hospital.

708
00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:54,152
She's gonna be fine,
just like you.

709
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:55,820
- Fine?
- Yeah.

710
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:58,857
I was a vampire.

711
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,825
For a couple hours.

712
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:10,435
Listen, Doug...

713
00:38:10,437 --> 00:38:12,137
I know it's been a day.

714
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:14,839
But now you know what's
out there.

715
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:17,575
Be nice to have another
good guy on our side.

716
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:21,312
I...

717
00:38:21,314 --> 00:38:22,747
No.

718
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:25,350
?

719
00:38:25,352 --> 00:38:28,820
Maybe you all can live
this life,

720
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:31,589
but I can't.

721
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:33,658
?

722
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,860
I just wanna go home.

723
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:38,229
So we'll go home.

724
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:41,800
And what?

725
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:44,235
I'm a cop 'cause I like
helpin' folks,

726
00:38:44,237 --> 00:38:47,072
but...

727
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,175
Vampires? That's...

728
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:56,448
?

729
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,583
I'm not...

730
00:38:58,585 --> 00:39:00,785
Doug.

731
00:39:04,257 --> 00:39:06,391
I'm sorry I lied to you...

732
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:12,030
but I can't give this up.

733
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:15,200
I know.

734
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:20,905
Donna, you kill monsters.

735
00:39:20,907 --> 00:39:23,641
You're a damn hero.

736
00:39:23,643 --> 00:39:27,312
But that's...

737
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:28,880
It's not me.

738
00:39:28,882 --> 00:39:34,319
?

739
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:36,955
I'm sorry.

740
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,058
I love you.

741
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:42,594
I'm sorry.

742
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:45,063
- Doug, wait!
- Let him go.

743
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:51,102
Donna, when you choose
this life,

744
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:52,871
anyone who gets too close,

745
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:55,840
eventually, they get hurt,
or worse.

746
00:39:57,844 --> 00:39:59,511
So let him go.

747
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:03,882
He'll be safer that way.

748
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:10,121
?

749
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:19,464
?

750
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:21,933
You were a little tough
on Donna back there.

751
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:23,434
What?

752
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:26,104
Just sayin'.

753
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:27,772
Was I wrong?

754
00:40:27,774 --> 00:40:31,876
I mean, when has knowing us
ever worked out for anyone?

755
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:35,346
I mean,
we save people, Sam.

756
00:40:35,348 --> 00:40:38,483
Yeah, we also
get people killed, Dean.

757
00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:39,918
Kaia, for instance.

758
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,554
She helped us
and she died for it.

759
00:40:45,091 --> 00:40:46,758
Hey, look, I know you're
in some sort of a --

760
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
don't -- don't...

761
00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:51,663
You keep saying
I'm in a dark place,

762
00:40:51,665 --> 00:40:53,698
but I'm not, Dean.

763
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,368
Everything I'm saying is
the truth. It's our lives.

764
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,137
And I tried to pretend
it didn't have to be.

765
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:01,206
I tried to pretend we could
have Mom back and Cass

766
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,408
and -- and help Jack.

767
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,443
But we can't.

768
00:41:05,445 --> 00:41:07,745
This ends
one way for us, Dean.

769
00:41:07,747 --> 00:41:09,314
It ends bloody.

770
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:15,053
?

771
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,754
It ends bad.

772
00:41:16,756 --> 00:41:19,040
?

773
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:25,941
