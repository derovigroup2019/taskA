Working cases.

712
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:16,913
That's all
I want to do.

713
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,187
Is this about the Mark?

714
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:26,823
I'm done
trying to find a cure, Sammy.

715
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:29,092
Dean, Cass is so close.

716
00:39:29,094 --> 00:39:30,627
To what?

717
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:33,796
We don't even know
if there is a cure.

718
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:37,133
So far,
we've got nothing.

719
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:39,235
We have found nothing
at the Men of Letters library,

720
00:39:39,237 --> 00:39:41,371
Metatron may or may not
know something,

721
00:39:41,373 --> 00:39:45,241
and maybe Cass is
onto something with Cain --

722
00:39:45,243 --> 00:39:46,943
maybe.
Yeah, maybe.

723
00:39:46,945 --> 00:39:49,712
Nothing is guaranteed, Dean.
So what?

724
00:39:49,714 --> 00:39:52,315
We can't
just stop fighting.

725
00:39:52,317 --> 00:39:54,150
Yes, we can.

726
00:39:54,152 --> 00:39:56,252
So, this is it.

727
00:39:56,254 --> 00:39:58,688
Y-you're just gonna --
you're just gonna give up.

728
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,958
No. No, I'm not
just gonna give up.

729
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:07,764
I appreciate the effort, okay?
I do.

730
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:11,367
But the answer
is not out there.

731
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:12,936
It's with me.

732
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:14,938
I need to be the one
calling the shots here, okay?

733
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,839
I can't keep waking up
every morning

734
00:40:16,841 --> 00:40:19,409
with this false hope.

735
00:40:19,411 --> 00:40:22,278
I got to know
where I stand.

736
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Otherwise,
I'm gonna lose my freakin' mind.

737
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:34,023
So, I'm gonna fight it
till I can't fight it anymore.

738
00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:39,629
And when
all is said and done...

739
00:40:39,631 --> 00:40:41,864
I'll go down swinging.

740
00:40:47,472 --> 00:40:50,273
