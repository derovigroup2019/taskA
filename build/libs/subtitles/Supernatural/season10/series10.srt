1
00:00:07,118 --> 00:00:08,417
Where's my brother?!

2
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:11,555
What are you?

3
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:13,189
I'm a demon.

4
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:14,890
Wow.

5
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,492
? So I drifted for a while
down the road to ruin ?

6
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:17,994
Everybody!

7
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:24,133
? I couldn't find my way,
I didn't know what I was doin' ?

8
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:29,939
? I saw a lot of people
coming back the other way ?

9
00:00:32,543 --> 00:00:34,543
? so I kept on goin'
when I heard them say ?

10
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:36,145
You...owe me.

11
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:38,114
So, do we
have a deal?

12
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:41,817
? "You gotta get up in the
morning, take your heavy load ?

13
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:45,554
? and you gotta keep goin'
down the long black road" ?

14
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:48,924
? long black road ?

15
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:54,063
You killed my dad.

16
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,437
? Long black road ?
mother.

17
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,472
? Long black road ?

18
00:01:03,474 --> 00:01:05,074
I'll get out.

19
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:08,844
? You gotta work like a man
in a real man's life ?

20
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:10,846
Give me the girl.

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,950
? You're gonna have to take
all the trouble and strife ?

22
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:20,456
? you gotta get up in the
morning, take your heavy load ?

23
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:24,126
? and you got to keep goin'
down the long black road ?

24
00:01:24,128 --> 00:01:26,195
Tell me
you had to do this.

25
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:00,896
Aah!

26
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:11,307
Son?

27
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:13,509
Fergus!

28
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:15,711
What's the matter?

29
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:18,247
Nothing.

30
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:19,849
Nothing?

31
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:22,218
You're soaked
in the horror sweat.

32
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,620
Haven't seen that
since the plague years.

33
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:26,555
Darlin',
what can I do?

34
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:29,859
Not a thing,
you evil bitch.

35
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:33,062
"Not a thing,
you evil bitch,"<i> mother.</i>

36
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:36,265
Let's not get too cozy
just yet.

39
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:25,448
She barely speaks to me.

40
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,452
She's like a wounded animal,
just watching me.

41
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:33,622
Look, Cass,
you know what?

42
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:36,892
You really tried to do the
right thing that night. You did.

43
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:40,563
This guy Claire was
hanging out with, uh, Randy --

44
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:42,431
All he did was use her.

45
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,099
Yeah, well, she thought
he was kind,

46
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:45,634
and for that
she loved him.

47
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:50,306
Shows how little kindness
there was in her life.

48
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:53,108
You know, whatever Randy did,
he didn't deserve --

49
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,510
No, yeah.
I know. I know.

50
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:56,378
I hear you.

51
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,149
Dean has had to kill before.
We -- we both have.

52
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:04,186
But...that was...

53
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:05,855
That was what?

54
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:09,859
Dean.

55
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:11,093
It was a massacre.

56
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:12,561
That's what it was.

57
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,700
I mean, there was a time
I was a hunter,

58
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:19,668
not a stone-cold killer?

59
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:24,907
You can say it.

60
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:27,109
You're not wrong.

61
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:29,044
I crossed the line.

62
00:04:32,984 --> 00:04:35,251
Guys, this thing's
got to go.

63
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,255
That won't be easy.
Well, then, burn it off!

64
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:41,346
Cut it off!

65
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,759
It is more than
just a physical thing.

66
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,394
It will take a very powerful
force to remove the effect.

67
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:47,396
Dean, we have been through
all the lore.

68
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:48,964
There's nothing.

69
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:53,102
This reaches back
to the time of creation.

70
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:54,703
It may predate the lore.

71
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:57,306
If we had
the Demon Tablet, maybe.

72
00:04:57,308 --> 00:04:58,841
But you said
it was missing.

73
00:04:58,843 --> 00:04:59,808
It is.

74
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:06,682
There may be
another way.

75
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:46,622
Oh, may I, uh,
help you?

76
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:50,826
His majesty didn't want you
wandering around unattended.

77
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,328
Certainly not
in here.

78
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,697
Oh, no, I was just looking
for a wee scrap of food.

79
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,198
That swill
they bring me --

80
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,933
hardly fit for
the mother of the King.

81
00:05:57,935 --> 00:06:00,135
I wouldn't know.

82
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:01,403
I don't eat.

83
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:05,240
If you please,
I have my orders.

84
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:08,344
Oh, you poor,
dear man.

85
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:10,179
Guthrie, is it?

86
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:12,915
Terrified of displeasing him,
aren't you?

87
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,117
I know
how my son can be.

88
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,886
You're all
scared spitless.

89
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:20,956
Still, a boy
listens to his mum.

90
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,125
I'd be happy to put in
a good word for you.

91
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:25,060
I'm fine.
Thank you.

92
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,829
Guthrie...

93
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:28,564
Whatever this is,
it bores me rigid.

94
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:29,798
Do I sign or not?

95
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,200
I found it
in order, Sir.

96
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:32,868
Do sign.

97
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,806
Mummy.

98
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:40,643
Bored? Suicidal?
Both?

99
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:42,544
Hardly, my dear.

100
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:44,513
I'm learning so much.

101
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:46,482
This place of yours --

102
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:50,185
poor thing, I see now why
you are the way you are.

103
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:53,155
My goodness!

104
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:55,958
The discontent, the gossip,
the plotting.

105
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,926
Plotting?
Aye.

106
00:06:57,928 --> 00:07:00,996
And that one --
worst of the lot.

107
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:03,399
Watch yourself around him,
mark my word.

108
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:05,567
You do realize
that's exactly what you said

109
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:07,770
about the guard, Gerald,
down in the cells.

110
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:09,104
And was I not right?

111
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:13,942
I know, I know you mistrust me,
and I earned that.

112
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:17,746
And it's a pity because more
than any of your other subjects,

113
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:19,248
I wish you success.

114
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:22,651
I know what you're
up to here, Mother.

115
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:24,319
Do you, dear?

116
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:28,257
You are shamelessly sucking up
so that I'll free you

117
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,027
so you can run amok and gum up
my operation once again.

118
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:34,396
No, thank you.
Free, schmee.

119
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:37,166
Why would I want to be free
when I can be here with my son?

120
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:39,201
Does it hurt
that you are the king

121
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:41,537
and there are advantages
for me in that?

122
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:42,771
No.

123
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:45,340
But more important,
I'm a mother.

124
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:47,209
Sue me -- I'm proud.

125
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:50,212
Excuse me if I don't
curl up in your lap.

126
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:52,581
You did manage
to stay away for 300 years.

127
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,216
Please.
We've been over this.

128
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:56,685
The locals were going to try me
for witchcraft,

129
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:58,821
and that never ends well.
I<i> had</i> to flee!

130
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:01,056
You could have sent for me!
Well, then came the chance

131
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:03,325
to study under
the great Milanese witch,

132
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,427
Letitia Di albioni.

133
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:07,262
And then there was
the unpleasantness

134
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:08,764
with the Grand Coven.

135
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,733
Anyway, it was no environment
for a child!

136
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:14,203
So locking me away in a squalid
workhouse was your solution?!

137
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:16,872
I will not apologize
for being a career woman.

138
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:20,442
Besides...

139
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:23,912
What's 300 years more or less
to folks like us?

140
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:25,848
Nothing.

141
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,083
I'm back now.

142
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:30,486
We can be a family.

143
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:41,263
They should
be here by now.

144
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:43,132
Was there word
of a delay?

145
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:46,068
All I do
is watch the door.

146
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,637
Who are you expecting,
Castiel?

147
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:10,793
Thank you, Ingrid.

148
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:12,995
I did as you asked --
at great risk, Castiel.

149
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:14,463
I know.

150
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:16,665
I approached you because
I know you share my belief

151
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,201
that it is Angels' mission
to protect humans.

152
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:21,670
And it's possible I can eliminate
a great threat to them,

153
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:23,939
but...I will need
his help.

154
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:27,009
He must be returned --
intact.

155
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:28,210
Is that clear?

156
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:29,645
Yes.

157
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,421
Told you last time I saw you
I'd get out of the slammer.

158
00:09:39,423 --> 00:09:41,657
It's temporary.
Trust me.

159
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:44,326
Well, speaking of
temporary,

160
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:46,161
you must have borrowed
some more Grace --

161
00:09:46,163 --> 00:09:48,297
you're looking
very good.

162
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:50,933
Of course, we both know
that won't last.

163
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:53,535
Is that why I'm here?
You think I'm gonna help you?

164
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:54,736
This isn't about me.

165
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:56,038
Of course not.

166
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,440
The great Castiel
never stoops to such...

167
00:09:58,442 --> 00:09:59,741
selfishness.

168
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:02,077
So, what is it, then?

169
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:08,016
Oh, I see.

170
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:10,452
I'm betting you didn't
tell Ingrid about him.

171
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:11,920
Hello, Sam.

172
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,290
Here to kill me?

173
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:20,963
Lovely room.

174
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:23,365
It's where you bring
the kinky chicks. Am I right?

175
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:26,735
I'll ask
the questions here.

176
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:31,974
You -- your only job
is to provide information.

177
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:33,675
Oh, well.

178
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:36,044
Information does happen
to be a specialty.

179
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:40,549
Got about 2 billion
fun facts up here.

180
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:43,952
Of course, whether I choose
to cough one up or not

181
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:45,487
is another matter.

182
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:46,989
We need to know

183
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:49,324
how to remove the Mark of Cain
from Dean's arm.

184
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:52,494
What?

185
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:53,762
He's back?

186
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:56,765
Because of the Mark?

187
00:10:58,636 --> 00:11:00,502
So...

188
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:01,770
He's a demon.

189
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:04,306
No.

190
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:06,942
Okay, what then?

191
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:13,348
What, did he
"kill a human" or something?

192
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:17,152
He's gone nuclear!

193
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:23,625
Total foaming-at-the-mouth,
balls-out maniac.

194
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:27,229
That's fantastic!

195
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:28,830
Do you know
how to remove it?

196
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:30,732
Maybe.

197
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:32,868
But here's the thing --

198
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,070
you expect
any help out of me,

199
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:39,341
you keep that crazy brother
of yours on a short leash.

200
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:41,944
Buddy...

201
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:45,547
I don't care
what happens to you.

202
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:48,583
You killed my brother.

203
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:24,864
I was hoping to be gone
by the time you got back.

204
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:27,734
If you don't like the
room, we can find another one.

205
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:30,970
It's not the room,
Castiel.

206
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:32,171
It's you.

207
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:35,141
This isn't
going to work.

208
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:37,744
I mean, come on.

209
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,679
You look
like my father.

210
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:42,515
It is his body,
but he's dead.

211
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:45,051
And I get it,
you feel bad, but you --

212
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:48,588
whoever<i> you</i> are --
are nothing to me.

213
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,556
Claire,
that's not true.

214
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:52,792
I'm in large part
responsible

215
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:55,461
for the way your life
has unfolded.

216
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:58,097
I-I have a responsibility
to help you.

217
00:12:58,099 --> 00:12:59,432
No.
You don't.

218
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:01,234
Claire.

219
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:03,336
You have seen things,

220
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:05,805
you've been through things that
no one your age should have.

221
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:08,508
And you are adrift.

222
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,743
I want to -- I want
to help you have a life.

223
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:13,246
I have a life.

224
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:14,447
I'm good with it.

225
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:16,749
If what you mean
is a normal life,

226
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,318
well, that ship
has sailed.

227
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,654
Well, that doesn't have to be the case.
You're still young.

228
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:23,990
Stop talking to me
like you're my father.

229
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:27,760
You killed my father.

230
00:13:27,762 --> 00:13:29,162
And that friend of yours

231
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:32,265
killed the last thing
I had closest to family.

232
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:34,067
Are you speaking
of Randy?

233
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:35,601
Family?

234
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:37,904
A man had you
in that room,

235
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:40,239
and Randy didn't
make a move to help you.

236
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,208
Maybe because
he was at gunpoint.

237
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,511
Dean Winchester's
a monster.

238
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:50,550
It's possible there's
a little monster in all of us.

239
00:13:50,552 --> 00:13:52,051
You want me
to trust you?

240
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:53,853
And the fact that you'd even
try to defend him

241
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:55,588
just proves to me
that I can't.

242
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,423
Claire.

243
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:58,724
No, Castiel!

244
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,693
I'm done.

245
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:03,563
I have to be on my own.

246
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:08,401
Ain't life a bitch?

247
00:14:08,403 --> 00:14:12,338
Nebbishy little guy, me,

248
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,942
always sticking it
to the lunkhead jocks.

249
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:17,677
You know what? Screw the Mark.
Let's just kill him.

250
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,746
Boy, he really is
a mess.

251
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:24,450
Who knew the Mark
was so toxic?

252
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:26,419
Well...

253
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:28,788
Actually, I did.

254
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:34,694
You know it is going to own you
sooner than later.

255
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:36,662
Yeah, so do how
do we get rid of it?

256
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:39,250
What, just like that,
social hour's over?

257
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:40,434
Yes.

258
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:42,201
And now we're moving on
to our keynote speaker.

259
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:46,906
Which is you...
With us asking the questions

260
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:49,609
and me taking
the personal pleasure

261
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:52,044
of carving the answers
out of you.

262
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:55,515
Just -- whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on there, badass.

263
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:57,750
Lighten up.

264
00:14:57,752 --> 00:15:00,786
Why do you just assume
I'm not gonna be helpful?

265
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:01,988
Because you're
a dickwad.

266
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,223
But I'm<i> your</i> dickwad.

267
00:15:05,627 --> 00:15:08,427
I have a special place
in my...

268
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:10,696
non-heart
for you both,

269
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:14,033
to which end --
ta-da! --

270
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:18,471
I would be tickled to help you
pop this biblical zit.

271
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:22,842
To do it, you are gonna need
one specific thing.

272
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:29,148
Your old bud...

273
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,851
The First Blade.

274
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:35,888
What?

275
00:15:38,293 --> 00:15:40,159
As I said...

276
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:42,195
Ain't life a bitch?

277
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:44,931
This is the single
worst idea I've ever heard.

278
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,566
You just whacked
a whole houseful of people

279
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:48,201
and that's when the Blade
was nowhere around,

280
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:50,002
and now you want to be
in actual contact with it?

281
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:51,737
We don't know that I
have to be in contact with it.

282
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:53,306
All we know
is that we need it.

283
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:55,007
No, no, no. All we know is,
he<i> says</i> we need it.

284
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:56,576
We don't even know
what he wants us to do with it.

285
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:58,144
Okay, step a time, all right?
We play it safe,

286
00:15:58,146 --> 00:16:00,112
we learn whatever this spell is,
how it works,

287
00:16:00,114 --> 00:16:02,348
and we keep the Blade
out of my hand.

288
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,184
Wait a second. Are you sure this isn't
the Mark making you want the damn thing?

289
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:06,566
I mean, why would we trust
anything Metatron says?

290
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,021
I don't trust
Metatron.

291
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:10,256
You don't tr--
then what?

292
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:12,325
What's his game
if he<i> is</i> lying, okay?

293
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:14,160
W-- the Blade without me
is useless,

294
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:16,028
the Blade with me
is trouble for him.

295
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,697
Then what does he want?

296
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,432
I don't know, but if we weren't
willing to take a shot,

297
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:21,234
then what was the point
in bringing him here?

298
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:23,336
Unless you got
a better idea.

299
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,074
Of course you recall the lovely
lullaby I sang to you nightly

300
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:29,342
after you fed the goat.

301
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:32,411
You never sung me a lullaby.

302
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:34,914
You dosed me with whiskey
until I passed out.

303
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:38,184
Even then, I had a touch
for pharmacology.

304
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:39,919
Your mum
was a prodigy.

305
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,254
Funny.

306
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:42,488
Not what I called you.

307
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:47,893
Business.

308
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:51,530
Squirrel.
It's been awhile.

309
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:53,266
Back to your
former self?

310
00:16:53,268 --> 00:16:55,601
Crowley,
we need to meet A.S.A.P.

311
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:56,636
Where?

312
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:01,874
Got to go.

313
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:04,910
Urgent.
A matter of state.

314
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:06,412
My son.

315
00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:08,648
So important.

316
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,983
Shall I wait dinner
for you?

317
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:13,586
You don't cook.
I don't eat.

318
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:14,954
It's a perfect
arrangement.

319
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:20,259
Not even a goodbye.

320
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:49,322
After my mom
split and went crazy,

321
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:51,223
Randy was
like a father to me.

322
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:55,227
First I lose my first dad,
then I lose my second,

323
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:57,296
and who killed him
and trashed my life?

324
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,900
The buddy of the guy
who killed my first dad

325
00:18:00,902 --> 00:18:02,468
and wants to be
my third dad.

326
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,971
Wow.
Sounds just like my life.

327
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:08,874
Complications and pain --
that's all family gets you.

328
00:18:08,876 --> 00:18:11,277
Yes.

329
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,180
That's why me and Tony
keep moving -- no strings.

330
00:18:14,182 --> 00:18:15,948
Hey, why don't you
hang with us for awhile

331
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,483
and unload
this whole mess?

332
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:20,219
Um, you might want
to reconsider.

333
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:23,789
People near me get pretty
unlucky pretty fast.

334
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,758
Oh, my --
that's him again.

335
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
The guy who killed
your second dad,

336
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:29,395
or the guy who killed
your first dad?

337
00:18:29,397 --> 00:18:31,464
The second thing.

338
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:33,699
Tell him to get lost.
I did.

339
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:35,067
He's a...

340
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,802
"Turn the other cheek"
kind of guy.

341
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:38,037
Hon...

342
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,772
You seem real sweet,

343
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:43,075
but sweetness
don't clean up messes.

344
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:46,679
Right.

345
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:52,585
Really, Crowley?
Radio silence?

346
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:53,853
Look, say something.

347
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,792
You want me
to do what?!

348
00:18:59,794 --> 00:19:01,527
Okay, look, we need you
to bring back --

349
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:04,263
Bring back the Blade?
I don't think so!

350
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:13,739
You don't have to
give the thing to me.

351
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:15,875
I should say not.
No, no.

352
00:19:15,877 --> 00:19:18,177
Just retrieve it and hang onto
it until we need it.

353
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,246
You. Moose.
You're the sane one.

354
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:21,480
You on board with this?!

355
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:23,315
Wings of Titania,

356
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:26,919
bear mine eyes aloft
as I bid thee...

357
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,042
It's insane.

358
00:19:50,044 --> 00:19:52,945
You want me to procure the most
dangerous weapon on the planet

359
00:19:52,947 --> 00:19:54,413
for Dean Winchester,

360
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:56,682
the man who goes mental
every time he touches it!

361
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:58,484
I thought you wanted
to go for a beer, catch a film.

362
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:00,519
Look,
if this plan works --

363
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:03,389
It's not a plan. It's a probable
death sentence for me and my kind.

364
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:05,257
If it works,
it's better for you.

365
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:08,227
Look, when the Mark is gone,
the Blade can't operate.

366
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:10,463
Win-win. Huh?
Win-win!

367
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:11,664
Stop that.

368
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,599
It can't operate.
It's hidden.

369
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:15,835
Okay, look, the Blade might be
powered down, but the Mark is not,

370
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:18,304
and I'm doing everything I can
to keep it together.

371
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:20,139
Now, you think the body count
around me is high right now?

372
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:21,774
Wait till Hal takes over.

373
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:24,043
We figured you stashed
the Blade somewhere far away --

374
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:26,245
Damn right.
It's in a crypt with my bones.

375
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:28,047
All right, well?

376
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:31,250
I hate Guam
this time of year.

377
00:20:53,007 --> 00:20:55,247
And why is this imperial
communiqu? coming through you?

378
00:20:56,535 --> 00:21:00,036
The King always
deals with me mano a mano.

379
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:05,275
Well, the king,<i> my son,</i>
had pressing affairs

380
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:07,844
and asked me, his mother,
to speak with you,

381
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:11,414
his most trusted...
<i>Underling.</i>

382
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:16,386
He said, "only Guthrie
can be trusted with this task."

383
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:18,354
I don't know.

384
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:21,157
It's not your place to know,
just to obey.

385
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:23,526
I did mention that
as his majesty's mother,

386
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:27,964
I have an unerring sense of what
or who is best for my son, yes?

387
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,833
Ad nauseam.

388
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:38,408
You will recall it was I who
exposed the traitor Gerald.

389
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:44,502
The one
the King executed.

390
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:48,106
And I am a tigress
when it comes to my bonny lad.

391
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:53,611
What is this task
the King requires?

392
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:58,149
Your r?sum? indicates
you were a crossroads demon

393
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,384
before your promotion?

394
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,052
I was.

395
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:06,024
Then you do travel.

396
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:08,226
Is that not correct?

397
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,834
The first Blade
is back in play,

398
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,335
and Crowley
is the one getting it?

399
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,837
I don't mean to be
an alarmist, but you --

400
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,405
Yeah, well, you know us.

401
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:23,308
When we screw ourselves,
we like to go whole hog.

402
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,310
This would be
<i>the</i> Crowley

403
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:29,214
who let the Blade
turn Dean into a demon?

404
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:31,549
I don't have
a choice, okay?

405
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,485
I don't do this,
I'm down the rabbit hole.

406
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:36,621
Hear evil, see evil, do evil --
the trifecta.

407
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,523
Cass, look,
let us worry about this.

408
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,425
You've got enough on your plate
with Claire.

409
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:41,893
Claire is gone.

410
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:43,943
Gone where?

411
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:44,819
I don't know.

412
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:46,169
I-I-I should have
stopped her,

413
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,803
but I am certain
that she is destined

414
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,671
for more trouble
and disappointment.

415
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:54,276
She is so...
so full of rage.

416
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:57,079
Listen, man, if I could
make it better, I would.

417
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:00,515
That's actually
why I'm here.

418
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:02,384
I was hoping
you might reach out to her.

419
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:05,087
Me?
Yes.

420
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:07,428
Seriously, I'm probably
the last person

421
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,529
she would
want to hear from.

422
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,263
I thought there would be
a connection --

423
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:13,466
one extremely messed-up human
to another.

424
00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:15,868
You could explain why you
murdered her only friend.

425
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,105
Oh, well, yeah,
when you put it like that.

426
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:24,143
All I know...
Is she won't talk to me.

427
00:23:24,145 --> 00:23:28,548
I thought if she understood
the kind of man Randy was

428
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,150
and the danger she was in,
she might...

429
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,149
What the hell?
Why not?

430
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:39,293
Long shots seem to be
the theme around here.

431
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:45,229
I'm gonna go
make a sandwich.

432
00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:47,664
Okay.

433
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,666
I like texting.

434
00:23:49,902 --> 00:23:51,268
Emoticons.

435
00:23:55,641 --> 00:24:00,344
He seems calm...

436
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:02,479
Considering
the effects of the Mark

437
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:05,308
and Metatron
in proximity.

438
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:11,481
Too calm.

439
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:13,410
Oh, oh!
Sciatica.

440
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,812
Oh, I need
a firm chair.

441
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,281
So I see.

442
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,183
I have it.

443
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,786
This is
my responsibility.

444
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,654
I will deliver it
only to the King.

445
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,861
You have demonstrated
unimpeachable loyalty, Guthrie.

446
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,532
You more than any
deserve this reward

447
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,801
from a grateful monarch.

448
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,104
Aah!

449
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:55,246
Don't screw with me,
sycophant.

450
00:25:56,383 --> 00:25:59,517
You said Guthrie was one
of your best, your most trusted,

451
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,920
and -- and yet I found him inciting unrest
amongst the court.

452
00:26:02,922 --> 00:26:05,123
Can't be true.
Can't it?

453
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,893
He -- he said you were colluding
with someone called Winchester?

454
00:26:08,895 --> 00:26:10,161
Y-yes?

455
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:11,629
And that you
were going to fetch him --

456
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:13,398
oh, oh,
what was it?

457
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:21,071
The First Blade,
which could kill us all.

458
00:26:21,073 --> 00:26:23,073
Naturally,
I confronted him,

459
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:26,076
and
he attacked me.

460
00:26:26,078 --> 00:26:28,312
I had no choice.

461
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:34,985
I had a vision
of Guthrie attacking me.

462
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:37,121
A prophecy.

463
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:40,624
I am an interpreter
of signs.

464
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,630
It's not possible.
I know, Sonny.

465
00:26:46,632 --> 00:26:47,998
And yet --

466
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,666
how could he
have known?

467
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:52,269
Spies everywhere.

468
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:54,471
I did try to warn you.

469
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:59,843
Fergus, these Winchesters
he mentioned,

470
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:03,180
they're not the hunter
Winchesters, are they?

471
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:06,183
Because they, too, can be
a great danger for us.

472
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:09,853
I mean, today we got lucky,
but tomorrow, who knows?

473
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:13,357
Who is there left
for you to trust?

474
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:21,598
Oh, we loved living there.
It was our dream house.

475
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,802
Of course, the
family came home from vacation,

476
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:26,470
screwed up everything.

477
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:27,805
I just about
peed myself

478
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:29,740
when the wife pulled
that gun out of her purse.

479
00:27:33,245 --> 00:27:37,414
We tore out there,
ran two miles, bare-ass naked.

480
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,782
Hey, it's Dean.

481
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,584
Look, Claire,
we need to talk in person.

482
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:41,785
Just tell me where, okay?

483
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,954
- Call me.
- That him again?

484
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:46,790
Guy that caused you
so much grief?

485
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,659
Worse.

486
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:52,463
Dean Winchester --
the one who butchered Randy.

487
00:27:52,465 --> 00:27:53,964
And why?

488
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:56,767
What was this Dean's
connection to Randy?

489
00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:59,670
He didn't even know him.
Or the others.

490
00:27:59,672 --> 00:28:01,004
And he gutted him,

491
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:03,807
and I saw him standing there,
soaked in blood,

492
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,309
looking like
he enjoyed it.

493
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:09,513
And now he wants
to meet and talk.

494
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:11,315
Maybe you should.

495
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:12,380
What?

496
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:14,114
Me and tony
are worried for you.

497
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:15,354
With this guy around,

498
00:28:15,354 --> 00:28:17,436
you're always gonna be
looking over your shoulder.

499
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,928
We've handled situations
like this before.

500
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:22,693
We can take care of him so that
they won't bother you anymore.

501
00:28:22,694 --> 00:28:24,333
Beat him up bad.

502
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,557
or...

503
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:30,097
...something
more permanent..

504
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:40,274
Yeah.

505
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:41,575
Squirrel.

506
00:28:41,577 --> 00:28:43,477
I've got it.

507
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:45,513
That's good to hear.

508
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,915
Of course,
I'm gonna hang onto it

509
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:51,385
until you work out how to get
that thing off your arm.

510
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:08,068
I'm guessing you're not here
to reminisce.

511
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,238
No, we did what you said.
We have the First blade.

512
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,474
Not here?

513
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:15,242
Not on your person?

514
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:17,478
Not saying.

515
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,180
So, back to you.
What's next?

516
00:29:19,182 --> 00:29:22,082
This is where it gets
kind of interesting.

517
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:23,617
Uh-huh.

518
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:26,754
It's very lonely here,

519
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:29,957
and I have little to do
but think.

520
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,927
And it occurred to me

521
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:37,464
that you really need this Mark
taken off of you.

522
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:40,901
And in order to do that,

523
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:46,540
you<i> really</i> need me.

524
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:49,977
So, here's the deal --

525
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:54,415
that first little tip
I gave you --

526
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,417
a freebie,

527
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,686
just 'cause you're you.

528
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:05,626
Every future step?

529
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:08,162
They're gonna cost you.

530
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:11,865
Big.

531
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:15,703
Oh, and FYI --
there's a bunch.

532
00:30:28,484 --> 00:30:30,718
Whatcha doing there,
Slugger?

533
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,761
I'm settling a score that's
taken way too long to settle.

534
00:30:40,763 --> 00:30:44,465
Oh, and while I do that, I'm
gonna get some information...

535
00:30:46,035 --> 00:30:49,169
...and I'm gonna enjoy
every minute of it

536
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:52,906
because you're gonna tell me
everything -- all of it --

537
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:57,745
and it ain't gonna cost me
a damn dime...

538
00:30:57,747 --> 00:30:59,246
Slugger.

539
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,836
All right,
I'm gonna ask this exactly once

540
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,871
before it gets ugly --

541
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:19,075
What is the next step
in removing the Mark?

542
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:24,280
I repeat my offer --
each step costs you.

543
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,516
You're confused.

544
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:32,421
See, each step
you<i> don't</i> give me...

545
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,690
is gonna cost<i> you.</i>

546
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,994
And it's been
a long time coming.

547
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,067
I mean,
where do I begin?

548
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,804
Stealing Cass' Grace...

549
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:52,308
Casting out
the Angels...

550
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,312
Making Gadreel kill Kevin
using my brother's hands,

551
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,748
starting an Angel war...

552
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,117
And, oh, yeah...

553
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:05,020
...you killed me.

554
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:12,561
My morality is being judged
by Dean Winchester?

555
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,197
How many people
have suffered and died

556
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,633
because they
believed in you?

557
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,237
How many times
have you lied to Sam,

558
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,639
including,
oh, by the way,

559
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,942
when he was possessed
by an Angel?

560
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:30,312
And you say, "oh, well,
it's all for the greater good,"

561
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:32,414
but lately, buddy,

562
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:35,518
that greater-good thing
just went away, didn't it?

563
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,321
Now people die
just because you want them to!

564
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:40,823
Oh!

565
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,491
Good, Dean.

566
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,893
Go darker.

567
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,363
Go deeper!

568
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:55,271
Surely you've noticed
every time you respond,

569
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,073
when the Mark
gets you all twitchy,

570
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:01,143
you fall deeper
under its spell.

571
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,813
You think roughing up
a few humans and demons

572
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,181
makes it worse?

573
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:11,086
Try messing with
the scribe of God, Bucko!

574
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,527
It's late.

575
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:22,231
I'm gonna drive around a little
bit, see if I can find Claire.

576
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,532
Right now?

577
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,467
I have to try.

578
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:28,337
All right,
well, be careful.

579
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,606
Hey, Cass?

580
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,809
Where's Dean?

581
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,787
And Kevin's death?

582
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,789
All on you.

583
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:50,459
You put him in harm's way
and kept him there.

584
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,394
Gadreel possessing Sam?

585
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:55,231
Who was it who tricked Sam
into letting him in?

586
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:58,033
Oh, and then
my personal favorite --

587
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:59,735
Dean Winchester,

588
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,904
whose entire existence

589
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,840
is defined by a war
on the dark and monstrous,

590
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:09,745
bromancing his way around the
country with the King of Hell!

591
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,251
Let's try this again.

592
00:34:16,127 --> 00:34:19,975
What is...
the next step?

593
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,759
What is it
you humans say so...

594
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,195
inelegantly?

595
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,664
Oh, yes.

596
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,967
Go screw yourself.

597
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,843
Dean!

598
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,012
Now it's time
to get serious.

599
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,714
Dean!

600
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:50,619
What is the next step in
removing this Mark from my arm?

601
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,255
Dean, open the door.

602
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,990
Hey! Open the door!

603
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:02,331
What is
the next step?!

604
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,143
Move!

605
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:19,081
Behold...

606
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,318
The river shall end
at the source.

607
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,661
No! Dean!

608
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,230
Hey! Stop! Stop!

609
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,804
You were killing him!

610
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,539
I have to take him back.

611
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,641
Cass, this won't happen again.
I gave my word.

612
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,443
I have fences
to mend in heaven,

613
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,245
and as it is,
I have a lot to explain.

614
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:53,215
If you ever ask me
for help again,

615
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,217
I will choose death.

616
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,721
You realize it's going
to get worse, Dean.

617
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,255
You're gonna get worse!

618
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,769
Hey.

619
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,574
You okay?

620
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,078
He said, "the river
ends at the source."

621
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,747
What does that mean?

622
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,616
Maybe nothing.

623
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,519
It's the last thing he said
before you guys busted in.

624
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,057
Dean...

625
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,926
Look, man, we had to.

626
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:39,995
Hey. No.

627
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,197
I get it, all right?

628
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,699
I...

629
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,304
I was gonna kill him.

630
00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:51,940
And I couldn't
stop myself.

631
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,812
We'll figure it out,
all right?

632
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:07,956
Remember what Cass said about
needing a-a powerful force?

633
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:09,758
Yeah. So?

634
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,961
So...I've been thinking.

635
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:15,197
Look...

636
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,801
Cain still
has the Mark, right?

637
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,569
And he's lived
with it.

638
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,771
For years,
he's lived with it.

639
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:26,475
So, yeah,
the -- the Mark is...

640
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,178
Strong, but...

641
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,114
Dean, maybe there's
a part of you that...

642
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,183
wants to give into it.

643
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,652
And maybe you have to
fight that, you know?

644
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:42,458
Maybe...part of that powerful
force has to be you.

645
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:51,900
Yeah.

646
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,002
It's Claire.

647
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:56,538
I've thought it over.

648
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,541
Maybe it's only fair
to hear your side of it.

649
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,543
I mean...

650
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:04,379
Castiel seemed
to trust you...

651
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:05,981
a lot.

652
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,884
Yeah, okay.
Where do you want to meet?

653
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,108
No!

654
00:39:28,593 --> 00:39:30,226
No!

655
00:39:37,101 --> 00:39:38,434
No! No!

656
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:07,963
Claire.

657
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:12,435
How the hell
did you find me?

658
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:14,403
Angels are able to find
those who pray to them.

659
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:15,938
Pray?

660
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,774
Oh, believe me, I gave up
praying a long time ago.

661
00:40:18,776 --> 00:40:21,077
It doesn't have to be
a formal prayer.

662
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:24,914
I can pick up
on a -- a longing.

663
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,816
Perhaps you wanted
to tell me something.

664
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:28,284
No.

665
00:40:31,122 --> 00:40:32,755
I don't know.

666
00:40:32,757 --> 00:40:34,423
Maybe.

667
00:40:34,425 --> 00:40:38,561
I guess I just...

668
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:42,832
Wanted to tell you that I
thought about what you said.

669
00:40:44,268 --> 00:40:48,704
I'm gonna try doing things
a little bit different,

670
00:40:48,706 --> 00:40:51,841
let go of the little bit
of monster in me.

671
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:55,244
Well, um...

672
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:58,314
I could -- could try
to help you with that.

673
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:01,650
I still
got to go it alone.

674
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:04,487
But I could...

675
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:07,123
maybe call sometime.

676
00:41:08,326 --> 00:41:10,793
Get out of here, would you?

677
00:41:10,795 --> 00:41:12,294
No one's
gonna pick me up

678
00:41:12,296 --> 00:41:14,497
with that butt-ugly car
sitting there.

679
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,467
I'll see you, Claire.

680
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:21,237
Oh, hey.

681
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:24,406
Not that you care,
but...

682
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:26,842
I like you better
in a tie.
