1
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:04,091
Wings of Titania,

2
00:00:04,093 --> 00:00:06,994
bear mine eyes aloft
as I bid thee...

3
00:00:06,996 --> 00:00:08,595
Hex bag.
So we're thinking witch?

4
00:00:08,597 --> 00:00:11,064
Yeah. This is old-world
black magic.

5
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:13,133
We're here for the witch.
Rowena.

6
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:14,535
Mother?

7
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:16,837
You did manage
to stay away for 300 years.

8
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:19,840
There was the unpleasantness
with the grand coven.

9
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:21,775
It was no environment
for a child!

10
00:00:21,777 --> 00:00:23,777
- So, what did he take?
- Peanut butter and bread.

11
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:25,479
They sent me
to a boys' home.

12
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:27,114
Teaches you some discipline
and responsibility, Dean.

13
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:28,549
Keep you out of trouble.

14
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:30,617
It's Cain.
As in Cain and Abel?

15
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:32,953
Lucifer was gonna
make my brother into his pet.

16
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:34,021
And so I offered a deal --

17
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:35,222
It's the bloody Mark
of Cain.

18
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:37,024
So I became a soldier
of Hell --

19
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:38,926
I can give you the Mark, Dean,
if it's what you truly want.

20
00:00:38,928 --> 00:00:42,062
But you have to know with
the Mark comes a great burden.

21
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:43,897
What the hell?
Charlie?

22
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:45,933
We're still connected
physically.

23
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:48,202
If you hurt her,
you hurt me.

24
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:53,273
Dean!

25
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:54,675
I'm so sorry, kiddo.

26
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:56,410
I forgive you, Dean.

27
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:57,945
You good?

28
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:00,747
No.

29
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:18,398
It wasn't me, man!
I didn't take it!

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,300
You keep on coming
and stealing from me!

31
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:21,602
It was that --

32
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:23,437
Where's my money?
Where's my money?!

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,605
You give me my money!

34
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:28,976
Swear on my mother,
J.P.,

35
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,079
I see your face in here
again...

36
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:33,747
I'll kill you.

37
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:36,149
Like hell.

38
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,552
This is freakin' America, man.
You can't just --

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,326
What you looking at?

00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:53,894
<i> After Cain killed Abel,</i>
<i>he became a demon.</i>

43
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:58,265
<i> I felt connected to you</i>
<i>right from the beginning.</i>

44
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:01,101
<i>You and I</i>
<i>are very much alike.</i>

45
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:05,839
<i>I can give you the Mark, Dean,</i>
<i>if it's what you truly want.</i>

46
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:08,909
<i> But when I kill,</i>
<i>I kill for a reason.</i>

47
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:11,345
<i>I'm nothing like Cain.</i>

48
00:03:11,347 --> 00:03:15,015
<i> Why are you fighting</i>
<i>what you really are?</i>

49
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:19,886
? Sometimes I sit
and I stare at the rain ?

50
00:03:19,888 --> 00:03:24,224
? isn't rain filled
with sorrow? ?

51
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:28,862
? Wonder if I'll see my home
again ?

52
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:33,233
? will it be dry tomorrow? ?

53
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:38,005
? Time passes softly,
and I'm a day older ?

54
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:42,409
? but still I'm living
days gone by ?

55
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:47,214
? ashes to ashes,
the rain's turning colder ?

56
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:53,520
? finding tomorrow,
the ashes, the rain and I ?

57
00:03:57,626 --> 00:04:00,327
Hey.
Hey.

58
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:04,831
Caught a case.

59
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,268
Apparently something
is taking people

60
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,238
and leaving their clothes.

61
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,141
Hmm. About time
this gig got an "R" rating.

62
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:17,711
All right.

63
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:19,753
Why don't you check it out?
I'll hold down the fort.

64
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,518
Dean, you haven't
left the bunker in a week.

65
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:29,189
And?

66
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:32,492
And you can't just
live the rest of your life

67
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:34,995
locked up in this room.

68
00:04:34,997 --> 00:04:37,064
I don't know.
I got three hots and a cot.

69
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:37,991
Could be worse.

70
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:39,866
Look, I know you're worried
about the Mark.

71
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:42,302
Yes, Sam. I am.

72
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:45,105
Between
what I did to Charlie --

73
00:04:45,107 --> 00:04:46,606
Charlie forgave you.

74
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:49,276
How about
you forgive yourself?

75
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,814
Because I'm not exactly
batting 1,000 here, you know?

76
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:55,482
Yeah, I<i> do</i> know that,

77
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:57,684
but staying locked up in here,
sitting on the ground

78
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:59,920
reading the same lore books
over and over and over again,

79
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,555
it's not helping you.

80
00:05:01,557 --> 00:05:05,258
You need to get back in the game
for your own good.

81
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,528
You can beat this, Dean.

82
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,896
Do you really believe
that?

83
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:11,698
Yeah, you're damn right
I believe that.

84
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,500
You know,
you also believed

85
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:15,969
in the Easter Bunny
till you were 12.

86
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:17,738
No, I didn't.

87
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:22,275
Look, I was 11.

88
00:05:22,277 --> 00:05:24,211
And a half.

89
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:26,446
And a half. Right.

90
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:33,253
So?

91
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,159
Okay.

92
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:46,733
And then -- then -- then
there was this bright light,

93
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:49,236
and -- bam --
the dude's just gone.

94
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:51,204
Nothing left but,
uh...

95
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:53,974
A cheap suit
and a pair of Florsheims?

96
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,610
Pretty much.

97
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,079
You see anyone else?

98
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:00,380
No, sir, Officer.

99
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:02,249
And what about,
uh, a chill?

100
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:04,484
Or did you smell
any rotten eggs?

101
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:05,986
What?

102
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:08,655
No, man. Uh...

103
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:10,223
I smelled flowers,
though.

104
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:14,094
You smelled flowers?
What kind of flowers?

105
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:17,297
Flowery flowers.

106
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:19,099
Flowery flowers.

107
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:23,036
Look.

108
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,973
We all know what's
going on here, okay?

109
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:28,742
Don't say it.

110
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:30,076
Aliens.

111
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:31,311
He said it.

112
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:32,579
Yeah, he did.

113
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:33,814
Dude was abducted.

114
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:36,616
Believe me, I know.

115
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:40,220
May 2003. Those suckers,
they grabbed me,

116
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:43,456
and they probed me everywhere.
Okay.

117
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,725
Thanks for your time. Yeah.
I'm talking everywhere.

118
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,427
And I mean everywhere.
Okay, okay.

119
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:49,263
Well, the wheels
just came flying off the bus.

120
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:50,464
Yeah.

121
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:53,133
No cold spots means
it probably wasn't a ghost.

122
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:54,568
And no sulfur
means no demons,

123
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,169
so that leaves us
with what?

124
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:58,271
Couple of little green dudes
and a bucket of lube?

125
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:00,040
Or fairies.

126
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,875
Or...Angels.

127
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:03,443
Ugh. I'd rather have
the little green dudes.

128
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:05,245
All right, I'll go scope out
J.P.'s place.

129
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,047
You, uh --
you ask around inside.

130
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:11,218
Or you know what?

131
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,485
We don't have to split up.

132
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:14,020
No, no, no. It's cool.

133
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:16,223
I can handle a little 20 questions
with the locals, okay?

134
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:19,159
You sure?
Yeah, hey, look, it's a dive bar.

135
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,895
It's my comfort zone,
hmm?

136
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:24,364
All right. Good.

137
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:26,032
Great.

138
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:39,246
? It's only
a matter of time ?

139
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:41,514
? it's only
a matter of time ?

140
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:42,849
What can I do you?

141
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:47,354
Screw it.
I'm gonna believe in myself.

142
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:48,588
Attaboy.

143
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,324
Give me something dark
and strong.

144
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:56,863
Hey, did you know that guy
that went missing -- J.P.?

145
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,367
Who's asking?

146
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:02,068
Just an old pal.

147
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,505
Look, I'm sorry
to hear about what happened.

148
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:08,508
But...
guy's a lowlife.

149
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,945
That night, I had
to kick his ass out of here

150
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:13,513
for stealing my tips.

151
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:16,082
Whatever J.P. got...

152
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:18,151
Probably had it coming.

153
00:08:18,153 --> 00:08:19,719
Ouch.

154
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:25,725
? You feel that separation ?

155
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:30,230
? will put a stop
to all you've seen to ?

156
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:32,666
? the same old situation ?

157
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:34,634
? though you struggle
through life ?

158
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:37,737
? in the end, it defeats you ?

159
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:44,377
? Oooooh ?

160
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:45,545
? oooooh ?

161
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:46,980
J.P. wasn't that bad.

162
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:49,783
You knew him?

163
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:52,953
This isn't exactly "Cheers,"
but yeah.

164
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:55,922
And don't get me wrong,

165
00:08:55,924 --> 00:08:57,557
I would not buy a used car
from the guy.

166
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,859
But he was harmless.

167
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:02,395
So,
what was his problem?

168
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:05,332
What wasn't?

169
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:08,001
You're in here getting stunned
while the sun's still up,

170
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:10,103
your life's
a regular Charlie Foxtrot.

171
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:12,072
Trust me.

172
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:16,977
I'm Dean.

173
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:18,278
Tina.

174
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:24,184
There you go.

175
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:27,687
How do you know
the Royale Motel in Scranton?

176
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:30,323
My dad, me, and my bro -- we got
snowed in there for a week.

177
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:35,161
Well, I was there
for about three months

178
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:37,263
after my father
drank all our money away.

179
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:41,835
Lived on white rice and tic tacs
until they kicked us out.

180
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:43,103
Good times.

181
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,172
My dad was always working,

182
00:09:46,174 --> 00:09:47,841
so I came up with
about 101 different ways

183
00:09:47,843 --> 00:09:49,109
to make
macaroni and cheese.

184
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:50,443
Serious?

185
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:52,545
Oh, yeah.
Now, add ketchup for spice, hmm?

186
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:54,781
Uh, tuna, hot dogs,

187
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:56,583
fluff marshmallow mix.

188
00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:58,318
Ugh!
That sounds disgusting.

189
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,153
Yeah, well, my brother thought
it was exotic.

190
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,691
Well, here's to,
uh, crappy childhoods.

191
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:07,527
Hey. All right.

192
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,799
Oh.

193
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:15,535
Oh. Sorry.

194
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:17,003
I should go.

195
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:19,039
Uh...

196
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,011
Before you fall hopelessly
in love with me.

197
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:27,180
You gonna be okay?

198
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:29,049
I always am.

199
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:34,187
How we looking?
Not great.

200
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:36,890
Turns out J.P. was about
three days from getting evicted.

201
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:41,061
His landlord said the guy
blasted Neil Diamond 24/7

202
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:42,762
and that his bathroom was,

203
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:44,731
"like staring
into the Devil's butt."

204
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,100
That's vivid.

205
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:49,636
And accurate. I saw it.

206
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:51,137
You saw the John,
or, uh --

207
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:52,405
Don't.

208
00:10:52,407 --> 00:10:54,040
So, you got anything?

209
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:55,375
Yeah.

210
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:58,912
I got, uh, Jack
with two scoops of squat.

211
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:00,480
I don't know, man.

212
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:02,248
I think we ought to just
call it a night and, uh...

213
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,683
And what?

214
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,753
Dean? Hello?

215
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:09,556
Sammy,
I think I got something.

216
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:19,599
Tina?

217
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,666
What the hell?

218
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:17,490
Son of a bitch.

219
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:27,732
Seriously?

220
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:32,938
Seriously?

221
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,173
Hey.

222
00:12:37,244 --> 00:12:39,210
What's your name?

223
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:40,745
Dean.

224
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:44,382
Dean? It's me -- Tina.

225
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:47,385
What?

226
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:50,188
Please tell me you know
what the hell is going on.

227
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,257
Honestly,
I'm not sure yet.

228
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:55,226
Because I left the bar
and then there was this...

229
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:56,962
A light?
A bright light?

230
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:58,363
Yes,
and then I was here,

231
00:12:58,365 --> 00:13:00,131
and I thought
this was a nightmare,

232
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,499
but...

233
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:03,768
Oh, God,
if you're here...

234
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,370
It can't be real.
This doesn't --

235
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:07,305
I know.
Just try to stay calm, okay?

236
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:08,840
Stay calm?
I'm a freakin' tween,

237
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:10,976
and you look like
some One Direction reject.

238
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:14,512
And we're in some freaky
serial-killer basement.

239
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:16,081
I can't --
Tina, Tina, just --

240
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,117
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you, okay?

241
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,788
Well, anything else
happen to you.

242
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,390
This is crazy.

243
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:27,559
How are you so calm?

244
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:31,329
Practice.

245
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:32,731
Who's your friend?

246
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,700
I'm not sure.

247
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:37,736
He doesn't talk.

248
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,506
J.P.?

249
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:08,133
No!

250
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:10,335
Hey. Hey!

251
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,137
Don't!

252
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:16,174
This is freakin' America, man!
You can't do this!

253
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:20,045
No!

254
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:39,798
What is it?

255
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:01,186
Hey, buddy?

256
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:04,022
Where did that jacket
come from?

257
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:07,092
My Bar Mitzvah.

258
00:15:08,295 --> 00:15:09,828
It was a magical night.

259
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,863
Yeah, I bet.

260
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:15,667
Why don't you try it
again?

261
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:17,602
Dumpster.

262
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:19,771
Found it by the dumpster.

263
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:21,873
All right.

264
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,608
Mmm.

265
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:31,950
They probably poisoned it.

266
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:40,125
Right.

267
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:42,727
Obviously.

268
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:47,432
What do you think
they're doing to J.P.?

269
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:50,969
Nothing good.

270
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:16,594
What are you doing?

271
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:21,466
Getting us out of here.

272
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:32,243
You know, before...

273
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,245
I thought
you were just another drunk.

274
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:37,916
I prefer
functional alcoholic.

275
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:40,485
Seriously, who --

276
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:42,320
What are you?

277
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:50,495
That...
is a long-ass story.

278
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:45,817
Flowers.

279
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:55,760
Yahtzee.

280
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:02,467
Get out.

281
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:03,868
What?

282
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,374
Hurry.
I'll keep him busy.

283
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:12,410
Screw that.
You're coming with me.

284
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:14,212
There's no time. Go.
Get help.

285
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:15,580
Tina --
I know you will.

286
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:26,090
Help me!

287
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:28,192
Help me, please!

288
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,194
I need a doctor!

289
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:33,298
I need a doctor now!

290
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:40,238
What are you screaming about,
girl?

291
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:10,601
Yeah?

292
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:12,170
Hiya, Sammy.

293
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:18,476
Dean?

294
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:26,768
Yeah.

295
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:42,418
W-wait a second.

296
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,186
Y-you're a --
Uh-huh.

297
00:19:45,188 --> 00:19:47,088
How?

298
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,356
No clue.

299
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:50,825
Some scarface-looking dude,
bright light.

300
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:53,695
Next thing I know,
I wake up looking like Bieber.

301
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:57,065
Why would someone turn you
into --

302
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:58,800
Don't know. don't care.

303
00:19:58,802 --> 00:20:00,068
Hey,
we got any grenades?

304
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,669
What?

305
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:03,638
Don't -- wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second. Talk to me.

306
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,807
Really, Sam? Now?

307
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,610
I got no grass on the infield,
and a girl's gonna die.

308
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:10,812
Sorry
if I'm not in a chatty mood.

309
00:20:10,814 --> 00:20:14,015
Look, you wanted me back
in the game.

310
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:15,950
I'm back in the damn game.

311
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:18,052
Come on.

312
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:25,560
Well...

313
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:27,729
Ma'am, allow me.

314
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,438
Your son is so polite.

315
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:39,140
Thanks.

316
00:20:43,213 --> 00:20:45,046
Where are we heading?
Tell you on the way.

317
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:52,454
Okay, okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

318
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:55,290
Wait, uh...
Maybe I should drive?

319
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:56,658
Yeah.
Yeah.

320
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,160
Okay. Seat. Seat. Seat.

321
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:02,163
Ooh.

322
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:11,973
Cake. Why would
they give you cake?

323
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:13,942
Well, don't know.

324
00:21:13,944 --> 00:21:15,410
It wasn't even good cake.

325
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:16,678
Too dry.

326
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:26,521
What?

327
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:30,091
Nothing.

328
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:35,797
Okay, not nothing.
Look, this is bizarre.

329
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,765
Even for us, Dean.
This is insane.

330
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:41,035
You -- you're like --
what, you're like 14?

331
00:21:41,037 --> 00:21:42,370
How does it even feel?

332
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:45,406
Well, I'm me.

333
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:49,310
I'm -- I'm old me,
but I'm a kid.

334
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:50,745
It's freakin' weird,
dude.

335
00:21:52,282 --> 00:21:54,616
And...

336
00:21:54,618 --> 00:21:57,385
What?

337
00:21:58,522 --> 00:22:00,522
There was
a Taylor Swift song

338
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:02,156
on the bus
that I hopped to the motel,

339
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:04,926
and, uh...

340
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:06,394
I liked it, Sam.

341
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:10,031
Liked it a lot.

342
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:11,499
Okay.

343
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,402
And my voice is weird,
and I've got like nine zits,

344
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:16,104
and I have zero control
over this.

345
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:17,972
I mean, it's up. It's down.
It's up for no reason.

346
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:19,474
That's enough.
Yeah, thanks.

347
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:21,709
Uh
let's just call it puberty.

348
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:24,646
Yeah, which sucks.
Again.

349
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:30,118
Well, listen, I checked out
the alley where you got jumped,

350
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,086
and I found yarrow.

351
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:34,044
Which means what?

352
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:35,891
Means we're probably
dealing with a witch.

353
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:37,225
Yarrow's a flower.

354
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:40,094
They use it in a ton of spells.
Okay.

355
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:41,317
We still got some of that
witch-killing crap in the trunk?

356
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:42,598
Hell, yeah.

357
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,166
So, we'll get you
changed back,

358
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:47,869
and then
light Sabrina's ass up.

359
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:54,709
Right?

360
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:58,279
Uh, yeah, about that.

361
00:22:59,783 --> 00:23:02,517
It turns out, this whole
freak show has an upside.

362
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:08,189
The Mark is gone.

363
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,592
How?

364
00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:12,727
Well,
I figure if this hoodoo

365
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:15,029
slammed me back into the body
I had when I was 14 --

366
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:16,164
You didn't have the Mark
then.

367
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,733
Yeah, and if we reverse
the spell --

368
00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:20,602
then it's gonna come back.

369
00:23:20,604 --> 00:23:23,504
That's what I'm thinking.

370
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:24,906
So...

371
00:23:27,344 --> 00:23:28,810
Maybe we don't.

372
00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:34,482
Wait a second. Are you saying
you want to stay like this?

373
00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:36,217
No.

374
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:38,286
No, but...

375
00:23:38,288 --> 00:23:41,389
If it's between being a psycho
rage monster/borderline demon

376
00:23:41,391 --> 00:23:43,257
or a teenager, well...

377
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,726
Really?

378
00:23:44,728 --> 00:23:47,862
Look,
I'm not a fan, either, but...

379
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:49,597
Sam,
this is problem solved.

380
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,366
And I'm still me.

381
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:53,368
I can still hunt.

382
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,205
I'm just, you know...
dewier.

383
00:23:57,207 --> 00:24:00,375
Okay, look,
y-you have a point, kind of,

384
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:01,743
but, dude --

385
00:24:01,745 --> 00:24:03,244
I know.

386
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:08,650
Some good news, though --

387
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:10,284
virgin liver.

388
00:24:10,286 --> 00:24:12,720
So, what do you say when
we're done doing our hero thing,

389
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:14,689
we take her
for a test-drive?

390
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:17,692
Yeah, sure.

391
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:22,230
I mean...you can drink again
in, what, like seven years?

392
00:24:22,232 --> 00:24:24,599
That's not funny.

393
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,100
That's kind of funny.
That's not funny.

394
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:27,669
Oh, come on, man.
It's kind of funny.

395
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:44,085
Looks like someone's home.

396
00:24:44,087 --> 00:24:46,721
Okay. Let's go in
through the basement.

397
00:24:46,723 --> 00:24:49,924
Get Tina out first.
All right.

398
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:26,527
Still open.

399
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:32,533
Tina?

400
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,339
All right, let's go.

401
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:41,209
Dean, I'm way too big
to fit in that.

402
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:43,544
First time
you ever had to say that, huh?

403
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:47,548
Big talk coming from the dude
wearing underoos.

404
00:25:49,853 --> 00:25:51,753
Okay, good one.

405
00:25:51,755 --> 00:25:53,594
Here, why don't you go
around back for another way in?

406
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:54,683
Yeah.

407
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:28,282
Don't!

408
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:29,250
Where's the girl?

409
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:33,154
Upstairs. Alive.

410
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:36,390
What did you do to us?
Nothing.

411
00:27:36,392 --> 00:27:38,860
I'm no witch.

412
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:40,494
I just work for one.

413
00:27:40,496 --> 00:27:43,364
Crappy gig.
Where is he?

414
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:46,968
She.

415
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,738
And she is the worst person
in the world.

416
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,173
Is that so?

417
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:58,212
I've been with her
for centuries.

418
00:27:58,214 --> 00:28:01,616
Things I've seen her do.

419
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:04,285
My sister and I,

420
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:09,023
she made us hurt people,
kill people,

421
00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:12,894
and when
we tried to escape,

422
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:17,465
she caught us
and tortured me,

423
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:21,335
and then she made me eat
poor Gretel's heart.

424
00:28:22,672 --> 00:28:25,072
Wait. Witch? Gretel?

425
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:27,441
What,
are you saying that you're...

426
00:28:27,443 --> 00:28:29,977
Hansel.

427
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:31,178
My name is Hansel.

428
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,848
Hansel?
And -- and...and Gretel.

429
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,283
Hansel and Gretel,
like the -- like the fable.

430
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:36,651
Like Brothers Grimm?

431
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:38,986
It wasn't a fable.

432
00:28:38,988 --> 00:28:41,822
It was based
on a true story.

433
00:28:41,824 --> 00:28:44,358
They just gave it
a happy ending.

434
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:48,229
Oh, okay.

435
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:50,765
We get to barbecue
a celebrity. Cool.

436
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:54,335
You can't kill her.

437
00:28:54,337 --> 00:28:55,670
You're just men.

438
00:28:57,307 --> 00:29:00,675
We're more than that.

439
00:29:02,345 --> 00:29:03,577
We're hunters.

440
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:06,580
Ah.

441
00:29:06,582 --> 00:29:08,182
Then let me help.

442
00:29:09,786 --> 00:29:12,386
Help?
What's in it for you?

443
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:16,524
Because if you're going to fry
that candy-coated bitch,

444
00:29:16,526 --> 00:29:18,259
I want in.

445
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:21,963
You want to help?

446
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:23,898
Tell me
how to turn him back.

447
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,466
Sam, it can wait.

448
00:29:26,502 --> 00:29:28,302
Tell me how!

449
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:31,906
The hex bag
that I'm wearing.

450
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:35,343
It will reverse the spell.

451
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:39,280
Squeeze it, and you'll return
to your proper age.

452
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:51,592
Look, we waste the witch,
I give you the cure.

453
00:29:51,594 --> 00:29:54,729
Deal?

454
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:11,912
Your friend J.P. didn't
have much meat on his bones.

455
00:30:13,616 --> 00:30:17,218
But a good cook works with
the ingredients she's given.

456
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,990
Mmm.

457
00:30:22,992 --> 00:30:27,161
Oh. Wunderbar.

458
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:32,800
Oh, don't worry, liebchen.

459
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:34,902
You're too good for soup.

460
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:39,340
I'm thinking
a nice, sweet chili glaze,

461
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:41,942
a few hours
roasting in the oven.

462
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:44,011
And an apple in your mouth.

463
00:31:07,637 --> 00:31:09,203
Hansel.

464
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:11,372
And pals.

465
00:31:11,374 --> 00:31:14,508
Well, our lost lamb.

466
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,778
I thought we'd
have to go looking for you.

467
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,515
Maybe even abandon
our home sweet home here.

468
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:24,518
I never dreamt you'd be stupid
enough to come back on your own.

469
00:31:25,621 --> 00:31:28,522
Hansel,
take care of them.

470
00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:32,059
Yeah, he's not exactly
your biggest fan.

471
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:34,342
Maybe you shouldn't have made
him chow down on his sister.

472
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:41,702
I never made Hansel
do anything.

473
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:45,039
Damn it!

474
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,108
They're hunters!

475
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:49,743
Rumpatur!

476
00:32:02,024 --> 00:32:05,893
Now...who's hungry?

477
00:32:12,156 --> 00:32:13,723
Don't move.

478
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:19,228
Ooh. Oh, scrawny.

479
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,696
We'll have
to fatten you up.

480
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:22,031
Don't freakin' touch me.

481
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:23,833
Oh, I'm going to do
more than that.

482
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:25,101
Children.

483
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:29,605
Oh, they're so sweet
and innocent.

484
00:32:29,607 --> 00:32:31,307
And delicious.

485
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:33,242
You'll see.

486
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:37,213
When I cook him up,
I'll give you some, hmm?

487
00:32:37,215 --> 00:32:40,216
If you like kids so much,
why not go after kids?

488
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:42,084
What's with
this whole Fountain of Youth?

489
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:45,755
Hmm, in the olden days,
if a child went missing --

490
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:48,624
ah, the young
died all the time.

491
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:53,462
Now, though, with all your Amber alerts
and your milk cartons,

492
00:32:53,464 --> 00:32:57,400
a person fillets one rug rat,
and people get so angry.

493
00:32:57,402 --> 00:32:59,602
Yeah, I blame Obama.

494
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,437
So, I improvise.

495
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:05,074
I take adults no one will miss
and give them back their youth.

496
00:33:05,076 --> 00:33:07,443
And then
Kentucky-fry 'em.

497
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:10,679
It's the only way
I can eat in peace.

498
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:17,319
So, uh,
is it worth it?

499
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:18,854
I mean,
word on the street

500
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:20,890
is people kind of taste
like chicken.

501
00:33:20,892 --> 00:33:22,491
A bit.

502
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:26,562
European children are more,
uh, free-range, gamier.

503
00:33:26,564 --> 00:33:30,332
Americans, though -- ooh --
they are heaven.

504
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:32,168
Fattier.

505
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:37,573
The meat, so finely marbled,
it's almost buttery.

506
00:33:37,575 --> 00:33:39,442
I just can't get enough.

507
00:33:39,444 --> 00:33:40,910
Mmm. Awesome.

508
00:33:40,912 --> 00:33:43,078
No!<i> I</i> am in awe.

509
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,947
This is my first visit
to your country,

510
00:33:44,949 --> 00:33:48,117
and I have to say
god bless the U.S.A.

511
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:50,753
Oh, so,
you're a tourist.

512
00:33:50,755 --> 00:33:52,154
No.

513
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,756
It's business,
not pleasure.

514
00:33:53,758 --> 00:33:55,658
An old friend
is causing trouble,

515
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,661
and the grand coven
asked me to take care of her.

516
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,729
Poor, stupid Rowena.

517
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:06,268
Wait. Rowena?

518
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:11,173
She got red hair,
a thing for ritzy hotels?

519
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:13,642
How do you know that?

520
00:34:43,508 --> 00:34:46,275
Now you'll burn!

521
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:49,979
Stay down, boy.

522
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:54,884
Turn him!

523
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:05,327
The hell?

524
00:35:24,615 --> 00:35:26,081
No!

525
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:00,246
That was crazy.

526
00:36:00,248 --> 00:36:03,916
Like...psycho crazy.

527
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:05,651
And you do this
all the time?

528
00:36:05,653 --> 00:36:07,019
All
the freakin' time.

529
00:36:07,021 --> 00:36:08,921
Not all the time.

530
00:36:08,923 --> 00:36:09,856
So...

531
00:36:09,858 --> 00:36:12,258
Can you turn me back?

532
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:19,265
The hex bag
went up in flames.

533
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:20,700
I'm so sorry, Tina.

534
00:36:22,404 --> 00:36:25,371
We may be able to reverse
engineer the spell, though.

535
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:36,449
Or maybe you don't.

536
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:38,718
Come again?

537
00:36:41,723 --> 00:36:46,325
I got three ex-husbands,

538
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:48,728
50 grand in debt,

539
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,963
and not much else.

540
00:36:50,965 --> 00:36:54,634
I was...
kind of a crappy adult.

541
00:36:57,071 --> 00:37:00,273
Maybe I'll do better
this time around.

542
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:04,510
Get out of town,
get a fresh start.

543
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:06,512
This is my second chance.

544
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:09,015
Everybody wants a second chance,
right?

545
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:16,422
Sure you're gonna be
alright?

546
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:20,326
Like I told you,
I always am.

547
00:37:22,897 --> 00:37:25,231
Can we at least give you a ride
somewhere?

548
00:37:29,437 --> 00:37:31,671
Give me the keys.

549
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:39,378
All right, here you go.
It's all the cash we got.

550
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,081
Thanks
for everything.

551
00:37:43,084 --> 00:37:44,584
You stay safe out there,
you hear?

552
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:46,352
I will.

553
00:37:48,923 --> 00:37:53,359
And hey, we'll always have
the Royale Motel, right?

554
00:38:02,103 --> 00:38:04,036
So...

555
00:38:04,038 --> 00:38:05,705
Grand coven.

556
00:38:05,707 --> 00:38:07,406
Any ideas?

557
00:38:07,408 --> 00:38:09,175
Doesn't sound good.

558
00:38:09,177 --> 00:38:12,144
Well, sounds like
an '80s hair-metal band.

559
00:38:12,146 --> 00:38:14,247
You know, lot of hair spray,
lot of eye shadow,

560
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:15,982
lot of keytar.

561
00:38:17,852 --> 00:38:19,552
No? Nothing?

562
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:21,854
Come on, man. I'm painting
a word picture here.

563
00:38:21,856 --> 00:38:23,589
Is it back?

564
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:32,999
Look, I know
what you're gonna say, okay?

565
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:33,966
But you were in deep.

566
00:38:33,968 --> 00:38:35,167
I know, I know.

567
00:38:35,169 --> 00:38:37,470
You saved me,
and you saved Tina,

568
00:38:37,472 --> 00:38:41,240
and...you pulled
a Dean Winchester.

569
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:46,012
Thank you.

570
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:49,415
Anytime.

571
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:51,651
Look, man...

572
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:54,220
Do I wish
the Mark was gone?

573
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:55,254
Yes, of course.

574
00:38:55,256 --> 00:38:59,091
Absolutely, I do, but...

575
00:38:59,093 --> 00:39:00,459
I wanted you back.

576
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:02,628
And now here you are,

577
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,698
and you didn't hulk out,
so...

578
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,500
I'll take the win.

579
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:10,336
As for the rest of it --

580
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:12,972
the Mark,
everything else...

581
00:39:15,276 --> 00:39:17,310
...we'll figure it out.

582
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:18,911
We always do.

583
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:21,647
Damn right.

584
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:23,349
Let's get out of here.

585
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:38,030
I'm back, baby.

586
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:42,768
?<i> Players gonna play, play,</i>
<i>play, play, play</i> ?

587
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:46,238
?<i> and the haters gonna hate,</i>
<i>hate, hate, hate, hate</i> ?

588
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,842
?<i> baby, I'm just gonna shake,</i>
<i>shake, shake, shake, shake</i> ?

589
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:52,011
?<i> shake it off, shake it off</i> ?

590
00:39:52,013 --> 00:39:55,181
? heartbreakers gonna break,
break, break, break, break ?

591
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:58,150

592
00:39:58,152 --> 00:40:01,420

00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:03,289
