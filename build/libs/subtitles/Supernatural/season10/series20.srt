1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,340
My name is Jimmy Novak.

2
00:00:03,401 --> 00:00:05,868
God has chosen me
for a higher purpose.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,503
You can never
be with your family.

4
00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:09,605
Castiel,
promise my family will be okay,

5
00:00:09,607 --> 00:00:11,474
and I'll do it.

6
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:14,110
Daddy?
I am not your father.

7
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:15,978
Castiel, you took everything
from me.

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,980
- Who is this girl?
- Claire Novak.

9
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:19,448
Claire's troubled.
She needs a father.

10
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,250
She's got issues.
Because of me.

11
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:23,319
First, I lose my first dad...

12
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:25,888
And then I lose my second.

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,691
Who killed them and trashed
my life? Dean Winchester.

14
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:31,694
We'll take care of him
so he won't bother you anymore.

15
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:33,596
Uhh!
No!

16
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:36,499
Where's your mother?
She went to go "find herself."

17
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,933
You promised, Cass!

18
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:39,568
I have a responsibility
to help you.

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,936
I still gotta go it alone,

20
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:43,739
but I could maybe call
sometimes.

21
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:44,919
Aah! No!

22
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:46,675
Dean's in trouble.
He's not getting better.

23
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:49,044
Aah!
Mother says the Mark is just a curse.

24
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:50,980
It can be removed.
If there's a cure, we'll do it

25
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:53,382
and deal with
the consequences later.

26
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:54,917
I can't lose you.

27
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:10,833
Amelia?

28
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:16,238
Amelia?!

29
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:17,706
Jimmy?

30
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,875
Jimmy?

31
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:24,647
Is it...you?

32
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,351
Castiel is gone. It's me.

33
00:01:31,254 --> 00:01:33,689
Sorry. I'm so sorry. I never --

34
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,624
I looked everywhere for you.

35
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:38,260
I thought I lost you again.

36
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:42,131
It's okay.

37
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:44,333
It's okay. It's...

38
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:47,269
It's okay.

39
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:49,772
I'm home now.

40
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:51,774
What's happening?

41
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:54,777
How's our girl?

42
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:56,278
How's Claire?

43
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:01,116
No!

44
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:02,818
Not again! No!

45
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,322
- Shh. Shh.
- No!  <i>No!</i>

46
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:15,297
Shh. Shh.

47
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:32,848
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

48
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,418
You're safe, Amelia.

49
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:40,789
You're home.

50
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,424
<i>Amelia?</i>

51
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:47,396
Amelia?!

52
00:02:47,398 --> 00:02:48,831
Jimmy?

53
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:52,701
Is it...you?

54
00:02:52,703 --> 00:02:54,336
I'm so sorry.

55
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:57,339
I'm so sorry I left.

56
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:59,074
I looked everywhere
for you.

57
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:04,146

The hell you think you're doing

63
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:36,712

64
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:38,347
Come on,
it's my birthday tomorrow.

65
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:40,716
How old you gonna be? 12?

66
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:42,117
Hmm.

67
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:44,653
<i>? Well, I once had me</i>
<i>a good life ?</i>

68
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:47,009
More like 50.

69
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,077
I'm looking for a guy
named Ronnie Cartwright.

70
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:52,413
He's supposed to be a regular
around here.

71
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:57,118
<i>? And my blues</i>
<i>is gettin' darker ?</i>

72
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:02,958
<i>? Oh, lord, I think these blues</i>
<i>have been turned black ?</i>

73
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,383
Ronnie Cartwright?

74
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:05,918
<i>? Yeah, they have ?</i>

75
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:10,222
Whatever you're selling,
I ain't buyin', sweetheart.

76
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:12,391
I need your help, Ronnie.

77
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:15,461
I'm trying to track
somebody down.

78
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,797
<i>? And if you're not</i>
<i>one of them ?</i>

79
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,367
<i>?</i>

80
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:24,103
<i>?</i>

81
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:27,206
I ain't never seen her before
in my life.

82
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,275
Her name's Amelia.

83
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:30,643
She's been missing
for a few years,

84
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,144
but according to her diary,

85
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,746
she was supposed
to meet up with you.

86
00:04:33,748 --> 00:04:35,748
I ain't never met her.

87
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,117
You were gonna introduce her
to some miracle worker.

88
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,419
Look, I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

89
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:41,987
I don't know that lady.

90
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:45,524
And I for damn sure don't know
some miracle worker.

91
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:47,960
If I did, you think I'd be
in a dump like this?

92
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:50,062
Now piss off.

93
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:52,431
Go back to
your Girl Scout troop.

94
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:55,200
She's my mother.
I don't care.

95
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:57,770
Can you just take another look?
I mean, maybe --

96
00:04:57,772 --> 00:04:59,538
I told you, I ain't never
seen her before.

97
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,142
Now I better never see you
again.

98
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:12,251
<i>?</i>

99
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:25,564
I told you to stay
the hell away from me.

100
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:27,132
You were the last person
to speak to my mom.

101
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:28,434
I need to find her.

102
00:05:28,436 --> 00:05:31,270
I don't know Amelia Novak.
You got it?

103
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:35,140
I never told you
her last name.

104
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:39,211
Wait!

105
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,813
Uhh!

106
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:44,983
Come on.

107
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:03,535
9-1-1, what is your emergency?

108
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:07,172
Um, yeah, found some girl
passed out in the alley,

109
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:09,475
uh, uh, by Susie's bar
on Overland.

110
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:11,410
We'll send an ambulance
right away, sir.

111
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,845
Can you tell me
if she's still breathing?

112
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:43,242
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, of course.

113
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:44,877
Cass, look, we're always
glad to help,

114
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,211
but Claire and I aren't exactly
on the best of terms.

115
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:48,380
I mean,
should I even be here?

116
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:49,915
I need help from both of you.

117
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:52,418
You were both troubled teens.
You speak her language.

118
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,487
All right. How is she?

119
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:59,792
Well, I-I haven't gone in yet.
I was waiting for backup.

120
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,794
B-backup?

121
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,996
Mm.
Huh.

122
00:07:03,998 --> 00:07:07,933
Three men and a lady.
Let's do this.

123
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:13,439
What are you doing here?

124
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:17,543
And why the hell
did you bring <i>him?</i>

125
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:19,244
Awesome.

126
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:23,215
Um, the -- the police found
my number

127
00:07:23,217 --> 00:07:25,150
in your emergency contact list.

128
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:29,621
Yeah, well...
That was a mistake.

129
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:31,290
You can go now.

130
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:36,462
Claire...

131
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:38,363
Why were you at a bar?

132
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:40,098
I wasn't.

133
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,436
Claire, what were you doing
in an alley outside of a bar?

134
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:47,840
Wrong place, wrong time.
Story of my life.

135
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,342
Look, we're not leaving
until you tell us

136
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,044
what the hell really happened.

137
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:55,481
So if you want us gone...

138
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:57,082
Talk.

139
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:01,086
I was looking for my mom.

140
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:06,792
I wanna find my mom and tell her
she ruined my life.

141
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:09,995
Your mom didn't --
She left me,

142
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:11,663
and so did my dad.

143
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:14,299
But Jimmy's gone, right?

144
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:16,134
Has it easy up in heaven.

145
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:20,405
So...Mom's the only one left
I can tell off.

146
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:25,210
When's the last
anybody heard from your mom?

147
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:27,813
Um...

148
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:29,748
When I was living with
my grandmother,

149
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,551
she used to send me
postcards.

150
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,922
This is the last one.

151
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:40,559
I got it just before
my grandma died.

152
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,194
Two years ago.

153
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:44,029
Nobody's heard from her since.

154
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:46,865
It was sent from a motel
here in town.

155
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:49,067
That's where
I've been crashing.

156
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:52,771
I was at Susie's bar looking for
a loser named Ronnie Cartwright.

157
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:54,640
Mom's diary said
she was gonna meet him

158
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,208
around the time
she disappeared.

159
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,844
Before he knocked me down,

160
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:01,346
he remembered her name.

161
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:03,048
He knows something.

162
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,183
Why was Amelia looking for him?

163
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:08,520
She went looking
for miracles.

164
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,025
She went looking for you.

165
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,433
This is all my fault.

166
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,703
You know, Cass, say it is.
What can you do about it?

167
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:27,039
Find Amelia.

168
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,540
She did disappear
trying to hunt down an angel.

169
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,275
Might be a case.
Yeah, but we don't know that.

170
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:33,145
Close enough. Come on, give me
something to punch already.

171
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:37,149
I'm kidding. I'm fine.

172
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:39,418
I'm just...I'm fine.

173
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,752
Why don't we go back to the bar,

174
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:42,287
see if we can track down
this Ronnie guy, huh?

175
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:43,341
Yeah.

176
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:44,664
We should let Claire know
where we're going first.

177
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:46,338
Perfect.

178
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:51,196
Hey.

179
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:52,965
Damn it. Well...

180
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,634
She either went looking
for Ronnie again or, uh --

181
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,570
Yeah, or she went to go grab her
stuff before taking off again.

182
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:00,853
Well, she's got a concussion.
Maybe that'll slow her down.

183
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:03,408
All right.

184
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,290
I'll head to the motel.
Y'all check out the bar.

185
00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:11,049
Hey, Cass, listen,
what you're doing for Claire

186
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:13,185
and helping her find
her mom...

187
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:15,887
It's good.
It's a good thing.

188
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:17,456
But?

189
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,725
Well, where does it end?

190
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:22,461
I'm not trying to be a dick,
but truth is,

191
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,696
you're not her dad.

192
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:26,264
In fact, you're not anything
to her

193
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:29,067
expect a-a constant reminder
of someone that's gone.

194
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:31,069
No, I'm...

195
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:33,972
Responsible for everything
that's happened to her.

196
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:35,607
Look, I'm just saying,

197
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,909
she's been surviving on her own
for quite a while now,

198
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:39,645
and -- and then
partly because

199
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:42,347
she doesn't have anybody
to answer to.

200
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:43,615
You know, there's...

201
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:45,550
There's nobody
holding her back.

202
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:47,819
We just found her
in a hospital.

203
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,489
You telling me that
she'd be better off on her own?

204
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:53,558
I'm saying she might be stronger
on her own.

205
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,604
<i>?</i>

206
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:08,940
<i>? for all those</i>
<i>pretty things ?</i>

207
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:11,610
Yeah! What's the rush, huh?

208
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:13,612
Heading out to beat down
another teenager?

209
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:16,214
That bitch attacked me!

210
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:18,350
Poor choice of words, pal.

211
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:20,719
Now...Amelia Novak.

212
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,020
Where is she?

213
00:11:22,022 --> 00:11:23,588
No?

214
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,123
Uhh!

215
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,392
Dean.
Listen, Ronnie, what do you say, huh?

216
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:28,827
We could do this all day,
unless you wanna tell me

217
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:30,262
everything you know
about Amelia.

218
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:33,365
Okay. Okay.

219
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,969
I met Amelia.

220
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:39,905
But she was the last one,
I swear.

221
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,606
Last one of what?

222
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:46,044
I worked for a faith healer.

223
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,046
No, he was the real deal.

224
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:49,781
Hey, I was blind.

225
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:51,183
He healed me.

226
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:52,818
Give us a name.

227
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,086
Now!

228
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,488
Peter Holloway.
Okay.

229
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,158
Yeah, after he gave me
my sight back, I...

230
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,128
Well, me made me work for him
as...payment.

231
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,498
I-I-I recruited candidates.

232
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,367
Yeah, he had...
A specific type.

233
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:11,169
Young but, uh...

234
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:13,205
Lost.

235
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,507
Wouldn't be missed.

236
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:18,643
Amelia was one of
these "candidates"?

237
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:21,179
Some people, he healed.

238
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:24,316
But others, he, uh...

239
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:26,218
Oh, man.

240
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
Look, I saw him one night.

241
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:31,123
It looked like he was, uh...

242
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,159
I don't know -- I don't know how
to describe it, but he was...

243
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:37,028
He tied one of 'em up and...

244
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,364
He -- he -- he was, uh...

245
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,333
cutting on them.

246
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,538
Look, after that, I was done.
Okay? I quit.

247
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,241
I haven't heard from Holloway
since.

248
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:07,025
Took you long enough.

249
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:11,396
How did you...

250
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:14,366
Also, you checked in
under the name "Claire Novak."

251
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:18,270
A little pro-tip?
Use an alias.

252
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:20,105
Okay.

253
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,976
Claire, we just wanna help.

254
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,379
I didn't ask for your help.

255
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:31,283
You know, this is good.

256
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:32,651
I was impressed.

257
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:35,287
How did you get
the information that...

258
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:39,024
It's mostly empty promises
and regret, but...

259
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,827
There were enough bread crumbs
to get me here.

260
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,665
How did you get
your mom's diary?

261
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,533
The motel manager
sent mom's stuff

262
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:51,069
to her last known address
after she disappeared.

263
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:52,737
It bounced around,

264
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:55,173
eventually found its way to me
at one of the foster homes.

265
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:58,276
You came all this way
just to tell her off?

266
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,779
You always get along
with your mom?

267
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:02,214
Never got the chance
to find out.

268
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,950
My mom died
when I was a baby.

269
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:08,253
I'm -- I'm sorry. I didn't --

270
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,121
Oh, no, it's okay. I-i got
to know her later in life.

271
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:14,993
And, yeah,
I suppose we got along okay.

272
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:17,529
What?

273
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:21,132
In this line of work,
death isn't always good-bye.

274
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:26,171
This is different.
My mom left me.

275
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:34,012
"Claire, I'll be home soon.

276
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:36,281
<i>We'll</i> be home soon."

277
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,403
Doesn't sound like somebody
who wanted to abandon you.

278
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:41,620
Did you check
her credit cards?

279
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:43,321
They wouldn't send me
her records.

280
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:45,357
Okay, I know you need to be

281
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,858
somewhere far away
from all of us,

282
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,460
but let me get my laptop.

283
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:50,328
I'll teach you how to hack
into her credit card records.

284
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,430
It'll help you get a lead
on your mom.

285
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:56,935
Show me, but then I'm gone.

286
00:15:08,215 --> 00:15:10,315
Hey, listen,

287
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:13,551
I don't think these guys
snooping around are F.B.I.

288
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:16,888
You know, I-I think they're --
they're hunters.

289
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,291
I-I'm sorry.

290
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,159
I-I wanted to give you
the heads up.

291
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:22,494
Wouldn't need a heads up

292
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:24,062
if you kept your mouth shut,
Ronnie.

293
00:15:24,064 --> 00:15:26,932
Hey, come on.

294
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:28,233
Don't you see that?

295
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:30,869
Come on. No. W--

296
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:33,071
my eyes! Come on, man!

297
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:34,973
I can't see!

298
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,175
Uhh!

299
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:55,248
There we go.

300
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,584
Seriously? It's that easy?

301
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:59,052
Yes.

302
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:00,787
I can also show you how to
set up fake credit cards.

303
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:03,523
It will make life on the road
a lot easier.

304
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:05,358
You guys are
credit card scammers, too?

305
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,861
Yeah. Hunting monsters doesn't
exactly pay the bills.

306
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:10,196
Then why do you do it?

307
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:12,299
To help people,
make a difference.

308
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:15,435
That's it?

309
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:17,470
That's not enough?

310
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:23,543
Are you all right?

311
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:27,047
Yeah, I will be when nobody ever
asks me that again.

312
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:28,415
You guys find Ronnie?
Yeah.

313
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:31,384
Yeah, he gave up a name --
Peter Holloway.

314
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:32,886
Said he was a faith healer.

315
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,487
So...What? You thinking angel?

316
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:36,089
Maybe, but it sounded like
he has healed some people,

317
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:38,358
but he may have
fed off others.

318
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,527
Yeah, that's weird.

319
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:43,129
All right, let's look into
this Peter Holloway guy.

320
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Claire, um...

321
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:48,635
Happy Birthday.

322
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:52,405
Um...

323
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:59,145
I got it at
the hot topical.

324
00:17:00,748 --> 00:17:02,515
Right.

325
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:04,784
Um...Thanks, I guess.

326
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:09,155
Whoa.

327
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:12,692
Just got an alert
from local P.D.

328
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:15,629
Ronnie's body was just found
outside of Susie's bar.

329
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:17,297
You were just supposed
to talk to Ronnie.

330
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,666
What did you do to him?
I didn't lay a hand on him.

331
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:22,168
Dean, that isn't exactly true.

332
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,270
I didn't kill the guy.

333
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:29,142
All right, I'm gonna suited up
and head back over there.

334
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:31,645
I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you, too.

335
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:36,149
You wanna get in on this?

336
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:38,518
No, I-I should probably
stay here and research Holloway.

337
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,321
Right.

338
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,259
Hey, Cass?

339
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:49,375
What happened at the bar?

340
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:54,234
Dean snapped.
He's getting worse.

341
00:18:01,143 --> 00:18:02,642
Officer?

342
00:18:02,644 --> 00:18:04,511
Agents Clapton and Page.

343
00:18:06,915 --> 00:18:09,482
And your little friend?
Oh. Uh...Yeah.

344
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:12,052
It's "bring your daughter
to work" day at the Bureau.

345
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:14,187
Uh, Vic was a, uh,
person of interest

346
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:16,156
in a missing persons case.

347
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:18,725
What do you got?

348
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:22,162
Stab wound. Clean through.

349
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:23,763
No sign of robbery.

350
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:25,565
Wallet and everything
was still on his person.

351
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:29,469
What are the red marks there
on the point of entry?

352
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:32,605
Burn marks, maybe.
don't know.

353
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:34,941
We pulled
his cell phone records.

354
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:38,011
He made two calls to the same
number prior to the attack.

355
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:39,479
Tried the number,
but the line's dead now.

356
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:40,947
Probably a burner.
Mm.

357
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:42,515
Will you excuse me?

358
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:44,250
Yeah.

359
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:45,785
Sheriff Coltrane. Uh-huh.

360
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:47,187
The wound looks like
an angel blade,

361
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:49,889
but the point of entry
is wider.

362
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:52,158
Can't explain those marks.

363
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,294
Best birthday ever.

364
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:57,797
Okay, all right, come here.

365
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:04,571
Hey. I, uh, got a lead
on Peter Holloway.

366
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:07,173
Oh, good, 'cause he's probably
about to split town.

367
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:10,543
Ronnie made a few phone calls
before he got shish kebabed.

368
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:12,212
You think to give Holloway
a heads up?

369
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:13,713
If he did, that's probably
what got him killed.

370
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:16,483
So...We gotta track him down
before he bails.

371
00:19:16,485 --> 00:19:18,084
Great.  Well,
according to county records,

372
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:21,287
Holloway owns a farmhouse
about 30 or 40 miles from here,

373
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:22,722
so I, uh, cross-referenced it

374
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:24,524
with Amelia's
credit card receipts.

375
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:26,292
The house is about
right there,

376
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:28,328
and she's been hitting up
Biggersons and Gas n' Sips

377
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,796
all around the area.

378
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:31,731
Probably staking the place out.
Exactly.

379
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,032
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go.

380
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:35,001
Claire, you are not
going out there.

381
00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:36,091
She's my mother.

382
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:37,371
That house could be empty
and it could be a trap.

383
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:40,406
It's too dangerous. I can't
let anything happen to you.

384
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:42,709
Anything <i>else,</i> you mean.
Claire, you're not going.

385
00:19:42,711 --> 00:19:45,445
You're not either, Dean.
What?

386
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,614
Back at the bar with Ronnie?
Oh, come on, Cass.

387
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:50,817
He wasn't gonna talk. I just...
Helped him talk.

388
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:53,052
Dean, Cass is right.

389
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:56,022
We need to keep the Mark
in check.

390
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,423
And we don't know
what's out there.

391
00:19:57,425 --> 00:20:00,326
You know,
maybe you should...

392
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:01,895
Maybe you should stay here.

393
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:03,496
So you wanna bench me again?

394
00:20:08,803 --> 00:20:11,171
Hmm.

395
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:12,739
All right. Fine.

396
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:15,141
I'll stay and babysit.

397
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:17,510
But if anything happens,
anything at all...

398
00:20:17,512 --> 00:20:19,913
Yeah, we'll call you.
No fighting.

399
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:21,514
Yeah, tell <i>her</i> that.

400
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:23,983
Both of you.

401
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:28,521
?

402
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:37,397
Can I have one?

403
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:44,437
Like you never had a beer
before you were 21.

404
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:48,374
All right. You know what?

405
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:50,143
If we stay cooped up in
this motel room all night long,

406
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:51,544
I'm gonna lose my mind.

407
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:54,013
Spoiler alert --
you already have.

408
00:20:54,015 --> 00:20:57,217
That's...
Come on.

409
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:59,519
Let's go.

410
00:21:08,195 --> 00:21:11,831
When this is over,

411
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,467
should I...

412
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:16,369
Should I leave Claire alone?

413
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:19,072
What? No, man. She's family.

414
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:21,341
Well, I mean,
she's not exactly family,

415
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:22,909
but she's close enough.

416
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:25,612
I mean, you two have history.
Simple as that.

417
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:28,581
So do you think
she's better off on her own?

418
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,885
Cass, she <i>just</i> turned 18.

419
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:33,920
You were alone when you left
for college at that age,

420
00:21:33,922 --> 00:21:35,455
weren't you?

421
00:21:35,457 --> 00:21:37,490
Yeah, but that's different.

422
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:39,492
How, Sam?

423
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:40,760
Here's all I know --

424
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:43,463
going it alone,
that's no way to live.

425
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:45,265
You being there for her,

426
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:48,401
even if she thinks she doesn't
want you to be there for her,

427
00:21:48,403 --> 00:21:50,470
that's good for both of you.

428
00:21:51,605 --> 00:21:54,007
Maybe, in the end.

429
00:21:56,744 --> 00:21:58,611
In the end.

430
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,288
It's in the hole!

431
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,658
It's in the hole!

432
00:22:13,662 --> 00:22:16,095
Bill Murray?

433
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:18,865
"Caddyshack."

434
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:20,533
It's a classic.

435
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:22,468
Never seen it. Not a fan.

436
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,304
How dare you.

437
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:25,738
You done?

438
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,607
Yeah, I'm done.

439
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:30,710
I'm done with
your whole generation.

440
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:40,386
Did you -- did you see that?

441
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:42,221
Did that go in the hole?
I wasn't watching.

442
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:44,324
Did the ball go in the hole?
"Happy Gilmore."

443
00:22:44,326 --> 00:22:45,658
Well played.

444
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,127
Thank you. Mm.
Yep.

445
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:54,067
Did that go in?
Did that go in?

446
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:58,271
It looks abandoned.

447
00:22:58,273 --> 00:23:00,640
Only one way to find out.

448
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:03,977
This is what you guys do?

449
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:05,478
Stay at cheap motels,

450
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,447
steal credit cards...

451
00:23:08,382 --> 00:23:10,016
Play mini-golf?

452
00:23:11,553 --> 00:23:14,320
Actually, we haven't played
mini-golf in a while.

453
00:23:14,322 --> 00:23:17,490
But, uh...
Yeah.

454
00:23:17,492 --> 00:23:20,059
That about sums it up.

455
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:23,496
You take the barn,
I'll take the house.

456
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,201
We help people.

457
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:30,136
At least, we try to.

458
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:33,573
Like, uh,
Castiel helped my dad?

459
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,176
Claire, what happened
to your dad...

460
00:23:37,178 --> 00:23:40,046
I'm sorry, okay?
I really am.

461
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:43,483
But, uh, there's something
you gotta know.

462
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:45,985
Your dad's sacrifice
was not meaningless.

463
00:23:45,987 --> 00:23:49,822
Yeah, he gave up his body,
his -- his vessel.

464
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:52,058
And because he did that,
Cass...

465
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,860
Cass was able
to save the world.

466
00:23:53,862 --> 00:23:56,462
<i>The world.</i>

467
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:59,098
Your father's a hero.

468
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,200
He did not die in vain.

469
00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:17,817
Last hole.

470
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:19,519
Already?

471
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,454
Yeah. See?

472
00:24:21,456 --> 00:24:23,890
They take your ball
on the last one.

473
00:24:23,892 --> 00:24:25,825
Drop it in the bottom
like so.

474
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:38,337
You okay?

475
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:40,339
You're not stroking out,
are you?

476
00:24:41,642 --> 00:24:44,610
The red marks.

477
00:24:44,612 --> 00:24:47,547
What red marks?

478
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:49,215
Claire, you're a genius.

479
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:51,084
Come on, let's go.
What?

480
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:53,853
Wait. Why am I a genius?

481
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:00,426
So this is hunting?

482
00:25:00,428 --> 00:25:02,128
Homework?

483
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,963
Cass said that Ronnie's wound
looked like an angel blade,

484
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:07,166
but the red marks didn't
match up with an angel blade.

485
00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:09,035
But if it was an angel <i>sword,</i>

486
00:25:09,037 --> 00:25:11,838
that would explain the size
of the wound and the red marks.

487
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,306
'Cause a sword would
have a hilt on it,

488
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:15,775
which could cause the --
the marks.

489
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,678
You got all that
from a putter?

490
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,715
?

491
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,340
Is -- is this what you mean?

492
00:25:51,912 --> 00:25:53,412
Grigori.

493
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:57,116
The watcher angels.

494
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:00,119
So are they good or bad?

495
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:02,255
Well, some of the lore says that
they, uh, they help people,

496
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:04,423
and some says that
they prey on people.

497
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:06,492
So...Keep digging.

498
00:26:11,532 --> 00:26:13,299
Amelia.

499
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:15,868
<i>Jimmy?!</i>

500
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,803
Oh.

501
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:20,239
<i>Jimmy!</i>

502
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:21,707
Amelia.

503
00:26:26,313 --> 00:26:27,980
<i>Jimmy!</i>

504
00:26:27,982 --> 00:26:29,448
Amelia.

505
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,317
I looked everywhere for you!
It's okay.

506
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,885
I tried to find you!
No. Hey, hey.

507
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:35,721
Hey.
You took my husband!

508
00:26:35,723 --> 00:26:37,757
Shh. Shh. It's okay.

509
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,258
It's okay.

510
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,073
Uhh!

511
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:07,316
Cass isn't answering
his phone either.

512
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:10,852
I don't understand.
Grigori angels went rogue?

513
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:12,520
Started feeding on people?
Why?

514
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:14,222
Don't know, don't care.

515
00:27:14,224 --> 00:27:17,158
I'm heading over to Holloway's
to end that son of a bitch.

516
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,061
Yeah, let me guess.
You want me to stay here?

517
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:37,378
Happy Birthday.
Don't shoot me.

518
00:27:39,748 --> 00:27:41,516
Let's go.

519
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:59,133
Sorry.

520
00:28:00,235 --> 00:28:03,771
I'm usually able to heal
any wound. You...

521
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:05,806
I was dreaming.

522
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:11,012
This whole time,
I was dreaming...

523
00:28:11,014 --> 00:28:13,114
of finding Jimmy,

524
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:15,750
of putting my family
back together.

525
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:19,754
You're not him anymore.

526
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:21,189
I can tell.

527
00:28:21,191 --> 00:28:23,457
No.

528
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:30,431
Where's Jimmy?

529
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:33,768
Your husband is in heaven.

530
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:47,848
Amelia, I promised
to protect your family,

531
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,484
and I failed.

532
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:53,020
Not if Claire's alive.
She's all that matters.

533
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,690
Claire is alive.

534
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,592
She's grown up to be

535
00:28:57,594 --> 00:28:59,160
a very strong-willed
young woman.

536
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:01,929
Oh, that's my girl.

537
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:04,265
I just -- I shouldn't have
ever left her.

538
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,367
I-I thought
if I could find Jimmy,

539
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,935
I would make everything right.

540
00:29:07,937 --> 00:29:09,670
But I should've never left her.

541
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:11,672
I shouldn't --
I shouldn't...

542
00:29:11,674 --> 00:29:13,608
It's okay.

543
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:32,893
Huh.

544
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,531
You must be Holloway.

545
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:43,671
For the last 50 years or so,
yes.

546
00:29:43,673 --> 00:29:46,574
Before that,
I was a Jenkins.

547
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,744
And before that, a Miller.

548
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,213
My real name is Tamiel.

549
00:29:52,215 --> 00:29:54,882
I'm a Grigori.

550
00:29:54,884 --> 00:29:56,584
A watcher angel.

551
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,520
Since when do angels
feed on humans?

552
00:29:59,522 --> 00:30:01,122
Since the dawn of man.

553
00:30:01,124 --> 00:30:03,324
What are you talking about?

554
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:07,395
Your souls...

555
00:30:07,397 --> 00:30:11,032
Are little slices of heaven

556
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:14,602
that are, if properly kept,

557
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,671
delicious meals

558
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:19,407
that can last for years,

559
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:22,410
decades even.

560
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:24,111
You're not an angel.

561
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,880
You're a monster.

562
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:30,518
Ahh.

563
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,888
I prefer to think of myself
as a gourmand.

564
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,325
I make heaven
a place on earth.

565
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:41,796
Keeps me alive and hidden
from the rest of the failures

566
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,431
that call themselves angels.

567
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:47,435
Oh, <i>they</i> are failures?

568
00:30:47,437 --> 00:30:50,157
Yeah, 'cause you're living
so large in your own life.

569
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:54,642
There were hundreds of us,

570
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,277
but now...

571
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:02,550
Each of our names
inscribed on our swords.

572
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:07,288
A brotherhood of perfectly
crafted, engineered beings

573
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,024
sent to protect

574
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:13,928
you pathetic,
bottom-feeding disasters.

575
00:31:27,743 --> 00:31:29,176
All right,
let's stick together.

576
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,611
First the barn,
then the house.

577
00:31:30,613 --> 00:31:32,713
If you have to shoot,
aim for the chest.

578
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:35,082
It won't drop an angel,
but it'll slow him down.

579
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:36,550
Got it?

580
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:38,319
Yeah.

581
00:31:40,655 --> 00:31:43,057
Are they...

582
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:44,492
I don't know.

583
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:46,727
We will get them help.

584
00:31:50,265 --> 00:31:52,366
How long have I been
like this?

585
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,034
Two years.

586
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:22,363
Dean.

587
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:29,270
Claire?

588
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:31,772
I'm so sorry.

589
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:34,041
Baby, I'm so sorry.

590
00:32:36,045 --> 00:32:38,879
I'm so sorry!

591
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:42,216
Okay.  Okay.

592
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,387
Let's go find Sam.

593
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:49,156
Claire, hey.
Oh.

594
00:32:49,158 --> 00:32:51,392
Listen to me.
Stay here, okay?

595
00:32:51,394 --> 00:32:52,560
Do not move.

596
00:32:52,562 --> 00:32:54,662
Okay.
Thank you.

597
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:57,498
Thank you, both.

598
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:00,501
Hey, Mom.

599
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:02,236
Mommy.

600
00:33:18,753 --> 00:33:20,421
Cass.

601
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,564
What the hell happened?

602
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:32,299
Listen, Holloway is a...

603
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,567
Grigori.
Grigori.

604
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:34,969
Grigori?
Yes.

605
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,403
No.

606
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:37,771
They were some of
the first angels on earth.

607
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:39,473
It was an elite unit
that went bad.

608
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,076
But they're -- they're extinct.
They were destroyed.

609
00:33:42,078 --> 00:33:43,744
Well, no, some survived.
And they've been hunting humans,

610
00:33:43,746 --> 00:33:45,713
making them create heavens
in their minds

611
00:33:45,715 --> 00:33:47,114
and feeding off them.

612
00:33:47,116 --> 00:33:48,682
Where is this abomination?

613
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:50,684
I don't know. I looked
everywhere. He must've left.

614
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,660
Mom. Come on.

615
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,428
Mom, you have to
stay with me, okay?

616
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,930
Come on. Stand up.

617
00:34:02,932 --> 00:34:04,932
Mom, it's gonna be okay.

618
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:06,200
Okay.

619
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:08,769
Thank you, sweetheart.
Yeah.

620
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:11,205
You know there's no fixing her,
right?

621
00:34:24,886 --> 00:34:28,022
You really think

622
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:32,192
<i>that's</i> gonna hurt
an angel of the Lord?

623
00:34:32,194 --> 00:34:33,594
No!
Aah!

624
00:34:36,332 --> 00:34:37,865
Mom! Mom!

625
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,302
Mom!

626
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:53,345
No!
Uhh!

627
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,938
Uhh!

628
00:35:43,964 --> 00:35:45,530
Mom? Mommy,
please stay with me, okay?

629
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:46,898
Mom?

630
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,868
Mom. Mom. Mom.

631
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,238
Mom.

632
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:58,476
I'm sorry.

633
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:02,681
I'm so sorry.

634
00:36:04,585 --> 00:36:06,551
Mom, I'm sorry.

635
00:36:22,768 --> 00:36:24,970
Amelia.

636
00:36:24,972 --> 00:36:27,372
Amelia.

637
00:36:27,374 --> 00:36:29,040
Jimmy?

638
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:31,176
Is it really you?

639
00:36:38,618 --> 00:36:41,653
Is this...

640
00:36:42,388 --> 00:36:44,055
It's heaven.

641
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:48,660
I...waited for you
for so long. I...

642
00:36:48,662 --> 00:36:51,630
How was she?

643
00:36:51,632 --> 00:36:53,031
How's Claire?

644
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:54,733
Oh, Jimmy,

645
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:57,035
she grew up so beautiful.

646
00:36:57,037 --> 00:36:59,471
She's so strong.

647
00:37:00,806 --> 00:37:04,209
Like her mom.

648
00:37:04,211 --> 00:37:05,677
I love you.

649
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:08,313
I love you, too.

650
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:25,136
So, what?

651
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:27,439
This is some sort of
halfway house for wayward girls?

652
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:30,275
No. Not at all.

653
00:37:30,277 --> 00:37:33,311
Jody Mills is good people,

654
00:37:33,313 --> 00:37:34,746
and she'll give you
a place to crash

655
00:37:34,748 --> 00:37:36,381
until you get
back on your feet.

656
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:39,284
It's not forever, right?

657
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:43,843
What are you gonna do
about Claire?

658
00:37:44,945 --> 00:37:47,346
It's not up to me.

659
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:53,452
You said sometimes death isn't
always good-bye, right?

660
00:37:53,455 --> 00:37:56,023
So good-byes aren't always
forever.

661
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,293
Right.

662
00:37:59,295 --> 00:38:01,015
Take care of yourself, Claire.

663
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:21,548
I felt bad about taking
the gun back, so...

664
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:27,888
Thanks.

665
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,179
But I don't think I'm interested
in any more homework.

666
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:36,730
Huh.

667
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:45,858
Do you honestly think
I didn't see you take this?

668
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:56,083
Really?

669
00:38:57,353 --> 00:38:58,952
I'll just put this in here.

670
00:39:00,723 --> 00:39:04,091
You know, Claire...

671
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:06,093
You already got your revenge.

672
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:10,831
You go down this path --
<i>our</i> path...

673
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,499
It's not a long life.

674
00:39:14,402 --> 00:39:17,070
I don't know.
You seem pretty old.

675
00:39:17,072 --> 00:39:19,139
Thanks.

676
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:23,744
Listen...

677
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:26,580
What I did, setting you up,
um...

678
00:39:26,582 --> 00:39:28,882
I'm sorry. I just -- I shouldn't --
Forget it.

679
00:39:28,884 --> 00:39:30,617
It's in the past.

680
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:34,488
?

681
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,623
Are you gonna be okay?

682
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:40,060
Me?

683
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:41,628
I don't know.

684
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,332
But I will keep fighting.

685
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:48,435
I'll keep swinging
until I got nothing left.

686
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:54,975
Will you keep an eye on him?

687
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:00,314
He's been through enough.

688
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:03,283
So have you.

689
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:08,655
Claire, do your homework before
you do anything stupid, okay?

690
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:14,061
And we're here if you need us,
any time.

691
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,666
I'll get you loaded up.

692
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,509
Um, Claire.

693
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:35,215
If you, um, if you...
need anything,

694
00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:36,650
ever, I'm -- I'm --

695
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:38,585
just wanted you to
know that...

696
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:51,498
? In the twilight glow
I seen her ?

697
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:57,571
? blue eyes crying in the rain ?

698
00:41:00,942 --> 00:41:04,244
? When we kissed good-bye ?

699
00:41:04,246 --> 00:41:08,448
Someone just tell me
she's gonna be okay.

700
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,917
Yeah, Cass. Of course.

701
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:12,285
She'll be okay.

702
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:13,720
? Meet again ?

703
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,422
So will you.

704
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:18,725
Going home
or leaving home?

705
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:19,993
? Love is like ?

706
00:41:19,995 --> 00:41:23,764
Just...going.
? a dying ember ?

707
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:30,337
? and only memories remain ?

708
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:40,947
? and through the ages
I'll remember ?

709
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:46,161
? blue eyes crying in the rain ?
