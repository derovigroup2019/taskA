1
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:14,303
? Your love has set
my soul on fire ?

2
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,740
? burnin' out of control ?

3
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:17,640
We're in this together.

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,142
? You taught me
the ways of desire ?

5
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:22,778
? now it's takin' its toll ?

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,812
No!

7
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:26,231
? You're
the right kind of sinner ?

8
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:28,550
? to release my inner fantasy ?

9
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:32,488
How's that stolen Grace
inside you working out?

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,040
? And you know
that you were born to be ?

11
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:36,959
It's the bloody mark of Cain.

12
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:38,212
? You're a heartbreaker ?

13
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:40,213
Magic that powerful comes
at a price,

14
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:43,132
and right now we don't know
what that price is.

15
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:45,168
? You're a heartbreaker,
dream maker ?

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,636
Drop the blade.

17
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:48,504
? Love taker,
don't you mess around ?

18
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,589
? no, no, no ?

19
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,973
First time
I touched that blade,

20
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:52,425
I knew that I wouldn't
be stopped.

21
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,344
I'm starting to think the
blade is doing something to<i> you.</i>

22
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,064
? You're
the right kind of sinner ?

23
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:01,434
? to release my inner fantasy ?

24
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,437
? the invincible winner ?

25
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,991
? and you know
that you were born to be ?

26
00:01:08,993 --> 00:01:10,743
? you're a heartbreaker ?

27
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:12,361
? dream maker ?

28
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,531
? love taker, heartbreaker ?

29
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:19,085
No!

30
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:33,349
Open your eyes, Dean.

31
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:35,635
Let's go take a howl
at that moon.

32
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:44,277
I heard the rumors.

33
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:47,063
I said,
“No, that can't be.

34
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:51,701
A Winchester?
One of us?”

35
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:54,620
but it's
isn't it?

36
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:56,906
Whatever soul you had,

37
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:01,244
whatever boy scout code
you cuddled up to at night,

38
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,746
it's all gone.

39
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,831
Leaving what?

40
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,049
Look at you.

41
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:17,093
Where is Crowley?

42
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,345
Eat me.

43
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:23,065
Mm.

44
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:28,487
Aah!

45
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:29,939
One more time.

46
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,275
Where is Crowley?

47
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:36,245
Where's my brother?
I don't know!

48
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:39,282
Then you're gonna call somebody
who does.

49
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,786
No one knows!

50
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,671
T-they won't answer!

51
00:02:45,673 --> 00:02:47,590
Make the call.
We're under orders!

52
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:48,958
Make the call!

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,228
Please.

54
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,713
Where's my brother?!

55
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,715

00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,783
Right, right.
So, no noticeable crop failures,

58
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,651
no mass cattle DEA
ING?

59
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,737
No. Nothing on the
radar. Nothing on the scope.

60
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,739
I'd say that's a good thing.

61
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,490
No, yeah, yeah, yeah
you're right.

62
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,959
I-I hear you Mike.
Thanks.

63
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,044
That<i> is</i> a good thing.

64
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:26,162
All right.

65
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,164
Well, keep me posted
if anything does pop up.

66
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,465
All right, watch yourself,
Sam.

67
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah, I will.
You got it.

68
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,585
Thanks.

69
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,425
Sam. Hello.

70
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,760
I think I might've found something.
Oh, good.

71
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,511
Good.

72
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:10,015
Cass?
You there?

73
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:11,934
It's okay.
I'm -- I'm okay.

74
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,936
Uh, go -- go on.

75
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,770
Okay, get this.

76
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,440
A John Doe who was murdered
in Wisconsin a week ago

77
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,692
turns out to be this guy
named Drew Neely

78
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,327
who went missing

79
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,996
from some religious order
in Northern Ohio, okay?

80
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:25,448
Yeah.

81
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,834
Now, Drew Neely has been missing
for three years.

82
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:31,003
Killed his wife,
his kids,

83
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:32,671
and...just disappeared.

84
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:34,340
I know it's thin...

85
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:36,459
...but if this guy
possessed...

86
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,210
Well, that would make him
the first --

87
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:42,515
The first lead,
the first anything

88
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:43,549
we've seen in...

89
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:48,687
Sorry.

90
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,356
Actually,
you know what?

91
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,224
Now that I'm looking
at this more,

92
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,226
I-I think I, uh --

93
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,194
I think
I jumped the gun here, buddy.

94
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:57,646
No, Sam, you said
it was something.

95
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,648
Yeah.

96
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,699
Uh, it's --
it's not.

97
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:02,651
I was wrong.
Sorry.

98
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,620
I can help.
Cass.

99
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:06,789
We tried that.

100
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,957
Sam, you can't blame

101
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,643
what that demon did
to your shoulder on -- on me.

102
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:12,628
You were out of --
I'm not, okay?

103
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,830
I'm not blaming anything
on you.

104
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,265
What happened...happened.

105
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,800
And...

106
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,420
You need to be worrying
about yourself.

107
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,305
I-I really shouldn't
have bothered you.

108
00:06:26,277 --> 00:06:27,476
How are you, Sam?

109
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:29,478
I'm good.
I-I'm all right.

110
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,347
I'm just tired,
you know?

111
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,483
I'll be better
when we get him back --

112
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:36,368
a-after I kick his butt.

113
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,805
I miss him.

114
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:43,275
Yeah.

115
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,110
Why would he just
disappear?

116
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:47,363
Who says
he had a choice?

117
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,747
Well, then who wrote
the note?

118
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:52,785
You think
there's any chance...

119
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,005
Any chance at all
that Dean is still --

120
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,207
still
even remotely Dean?

121
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:23,365
? I'm too sexy for my love,
too sexy for my love ?

122
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:26,619
? love's going to leave me ?

123
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:31,240
? and I sexy for my shirt,
too sexy for my shirt ?

124
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,743
? so sexy it hurts ?

125
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:43,469
? And I'm too sexy for Milan,
too sexy for Milan ?

126
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:45,471
- Turn it off!
- Get off the stage!

127
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:46,388
Everybody!

128
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,390
Oh!

129
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,310
Okay.

130
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:53,229
Wow.

131
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,681
What time is it?

132
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,766
Darryl's gonna kill me
if I'm late from my break again.

133
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,269
Mm.

134
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,770
Oops.

135
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,072
Damn!

136
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:07,026
I told you
to hurry it up.

137
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,194
But then you had to go
and do that thing

138
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,446
with the...thing.

139
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,781
Oh, you mean that thing
that you were begging me for?

140
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,251
Begging you to hurry it up,
maybe.

141
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,920
Well, let's not argue
about good sex.

142
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:19,922
It<i> was</i> good, wasn't it?

143
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:21,840
Mm-hmm.

144
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:28,297
Just, uh...don't get
too excited, you know?

145
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,716
Or...too attached.

146
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,302
'Cause I'm just
rollin' through.

147
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,741
You know, there's about
a million other ways

148
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:40,526
you could have said that.

149
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:45,448
Whoa!

150
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:47,983
“Whoa”?

151
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,151
What's going on here?

152
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,070
What's it look like?

153
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,288
In my bed?

154
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,789
What?

155
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:57,126
Oh, yeah.

156
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:58,327
Jerk.

157
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,129
Bitch.

158
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:01,163
Get a room, you two.

159
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,332
Had a room
till you two soiled it.

160
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,384
Love you, Crowley.

161
00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:08,053
Love you more,
sweetheart.

162
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:10,472
Anne Marie,
jackass.

163
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:11,474
Knew that.

164
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,260
Pants?

165
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:27,156
Best of three.

166
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:28,657
Losers buy the beer.

167
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,192
Lots of beer.

168
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,028
Girl seemed nice.

169
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,030
Slightly damaged.

170
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,666
I could see the old you
falling for that.

171
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:39,702
Yeah, well,
not to worry.

172
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,036
She means nothing.

173
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,588
Good, good.

174
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,839
'Cause you and I,

175
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:45,341
we're rolling stones.

176
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:49,678
No distractions.

177
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,546
Lock it down.
Lock it down.

178
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,847
Stop talking.
You're bodging it!

179
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:53,382
Aw.

180
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,600
If you'd
shut up --

181
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:56,268
keep talking --
I can't play the game.

182
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,605
Come on, we'll talk
about it. Let's go.

183
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:01,140
Come on. Let's go.

184
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,307
Hang on.

185
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:04,893
Get off me.

186
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,061
Why are you doing this
to me?!

187
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,196
You need to calm down.

188
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:08,530
Where were you?
Stop it!

189
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:09,481
Hey, is this him?

190
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,399
There a problem?

191
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,067
Yeah, are you Matt?

192
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,118
Dean!

193
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,331
You need to get away
from here.

194
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,050
Don't try
and contact her.

195
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:29,718
In fact,
don't even think about her.

196
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,170
You understand me?!

197
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:00,282
Just a moment.

198
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,958
Castiel.

199
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,209
Hannah.

200
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,183
I'm sensing awkwardness.

201
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,109
So...There's no --
no leader?

202
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:29,311
You're governing
yourselves?

203
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,730
Mostly.

204
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,815
There's lot of meeting

205
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,650
on rebuilding
and reorganization --

206
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,401
lots of reconciliation.

207
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:37,536
And Metatron?

208
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:39,404
Still in jail.

209
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,707
His door has been made
permanent.

210
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,796
I would've thought
we'd see you sooner.

211
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:49,214
I would've come sooner
but --

212
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:52,050
I'm glad you didn't.

213
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:53,001
You see, I...

214
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,137
I need your help.

215
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,639
Heaven needs your help.

216
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:01,343
Anything.

217
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,595
Most of the angels
who fell during the fall

218
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,780
have returned to heaven.

219
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:06,181
A few have not.

220
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,684
Some out-and-out refuse.

221
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,853
Rogues.

222
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,155
Two of them have killed
one of our own

223
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:15,741
for only attempting
to bring them back home.

224
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,942
Who were they?

225
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,577
Daniel and Adina.

226
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:21,029
They must be found.

227
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,614
They must be brought home,

228
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,617
and they must be punished
for the sake of all.

229
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,785
Will you help me?

230
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,876
Yes.

231
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,931
Appreciate you coming down,
agent.

232
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:42,134
But I'm afraid you may have just
cost Uncle Sam a tank of gas.

233
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,519
Oh, why's that?

234
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:46,054
You came up here to investigate
Drew Neely's murder, right?

235
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,222
Right.

236
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,275
Problem is, no one's certain
it was a murder at all.

237
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:51,727
Okay, then what are
we dealing with here?

238
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,729
A suicide?

239
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,146
Self-defense, more likely.

240
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,282
Uh, the surveillance footage
was corrupted.

241
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,568
Our techies finally managed
to clean up the file.

242
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,620
Hold on a sec now.

243
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:15,551
We can do this
however you want.

244
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:19,087
Don't pretend I didn't see you
this afternoon.

245
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:23,175
Did you get a good look?
You see my moves?

246
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,428
I hope so, 'cause I sure could
use the competition.

247
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:34,019
That John Doe right there

248
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,854
is the one you want to
keep your eye on.

249
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,242
Son of a bitch.

250
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,446
Watch.

251
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,449
Well, all you Abaddon groupies
are the same, you know that?

252
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,618
You, the douche that jumped me
at the gas station,

253
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,755
you can't just can't accept
that the queen is dead, can you?

254
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:55,007
Maybe we just can't accept

255
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,175
that a douche like you was
the one who killed her.

256
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:58,760
Ah.

257
00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:00,762
Yeah, that's got to hurt,
doesn't it?

258
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,072
Okay, now, porn guy's just
minding his own business.

259
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:12,174
And there's Drew Neely.

260
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:13,191
See the knife?

261
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:14,142
Yeah.

262
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,644
That's intent
right there.

263
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,896
Now watch this.

264
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:25,454
Aah!

265
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,233
Looks like a cutlass
or something.

266
00:14:38,235 --> 00:14:42,387
I don't know
what the hell this is.

267
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:43,839
Problem is,
we don't know

268
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,724
if this guy's a hero
or a psychopath.

269
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:56,351
That's the image that's getting
uploaded to the wires.

270
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,603
Detective,
do you mind if I, uh,

271
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:00,188
take another look
at this?

272
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,239
Knock yourself out.

273
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:02,741
I'll be back
in a few.

274
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:03,909
All right.

275
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,158
Fax, Dad.

276
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:20,329
Who's it from, buddy?

277
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:22,164
Doesn't say.
There's a picture.

278
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,337
Thanks a lot, bud.

279
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:31,390
Is it him?

280
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,738
I didn't know angels
could get nauseous.

281
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,407
I just need a moment.

282
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:43,078
It's my fault.
I'll take the curves faster.

283
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,883
And you, Castiel?

284
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:51,503
You're feeling well?

285
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:52,505
Oh, yes.

286
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,591
Like a million dollars.

287
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:58,060
That's not true.

288
00:17:58,062 --> 00:18:00,262
It's my truth.

289
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:05,834
When you left heaven,
your borrowed Grace was failing.

290
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,853
By the looks of you,
you've only gotten worse.

291
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:08,904
I'm fine.

292
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:11,690
You're dying, Castiel.

293
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:12,741
You need more Grace.

294
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:15,944
And we have a mission
in front of us

295
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:19,281
that supersedes my needs --
all of our needs.

296
00:18:19,283 --> 00:18:20,782
Don't you agree?

297
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,925
You're a good soldier,
Hannah...

298
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:32,010
And one of the best.

299
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:34,513
Metatron certainly could not
have been brought to heel

300
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:35,797
without your bravery.

301
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,799
Or yours.

302
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:40,802
You must take care
of yourself, Castiel.

303
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:47,809
And another angel should die
so that I can be saved?

304
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:50,529
Is this really
that hard to understand?

305
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:55,651
Hannah.

306
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,038
I'm feeling better now.

307
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:03,558
Oh, yeah.

308
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,410
Porn guy was an animal.

309
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:06,745
Bro came at him like,
“what?!”

310
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:08,463
and he was all like,
“wh-a-a-at?”

311
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,334
“say my name!
Say my name!

312
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:14,169
Say my name.”

313
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:20,842
And there was
a lot of blood.

314
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:22,511
Right.

315
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:23,478
Um...

316
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,230
When the guy,
uh -- when --

317
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,516
When...

318
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:31,770
“Porn guy” came in,
did he...say anything?

319
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,923
“W-where's the porn”.

320
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,858
That's all he said?

321
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,778
Did he buy anything?

322
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,114
Did he -- did he use
a credit card?

323
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:45,917
Nothing?

324
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,035
So some guy comes in,

325
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:49,287
kills another guy
in your store on your watch,

326
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,472
and you just --

327
00:19:50,474 --> 00:19:52,040
you what?
Just keep on keepin' on?

328
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:54,960
You mean when porn guy was
stabbing the other guy to death

329
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:56,144
10 feet in front of me,

330
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:58,046
and I was having
a total code-brown moment

331
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:01,466
in my favorite freakin' pants
because I thought I was next,

332
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:04,219
did I conduct
a field interview?

333
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,139
No.

334
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:12,861
Oh, hey.
Uh, can you do me a solid?

335
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:15,614
Found this wedged
under the T.P.

336
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:17,065
I think
it's the dead guy's phone,

337
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:19,317
and, uh, if you're
heading back to the station...

338
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,592
You're dead.

339
00:20:43,594 --> 00:20:44,643
Nope.

340
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,395
Just using
a dead man's phone.

341
00:20:46,397 --> 00:20:49,181
Moose.
Took you long enough.

342
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:51,099
Your brother and I
were beginning to wonder

343
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:52,184
if you'd hit another dog.

344
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,652
You know?

345
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:57,522
My brother is dead,
Crowley.

346
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,991
I know you have
some freaking demon

347
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,077
parading around
in his meatsuit,

348
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,696
and trust me,
you are gonna pay for that.

349
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,364
Moose. Moose.

350
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,700
I'm afraid you haven't
allowed yourself

351
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,702
to dream
quite big enough here.

352
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:14,923
Your brother is very much alive,
courtesy of the mark.

353
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:17,375
And the only demonized soul
inside of Dean

354
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,627
is his and his alone.

355
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:20,378
Wee bit more twisted,

356
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,348
a little more mangled
beyond human recognition,

357
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,550
but, I can assure you,
all his.

358
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:28,136
There, now.
Feel better?

359
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:29,888
And the, uh, Abaddon supporters
you've been sending

360
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,523
to kill my brother,

361
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:33,775
how does Dean feel
about that double-cross?

362
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:35,143
If that's
what you think is happening,

363
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:36,778
then you're more out of
your depths than I thought.

364
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,980
I don't know
how you did this,

365
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:43,201
what kind of...
Black-magic stunt you pulled,

366
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:45,070
but hear me --

367
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:47,122
I will save my brother

368
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:48,457
or die trying.

369
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:51,960
You know what tickles me
about all this?

370
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:55,130
It's what's<i> really</i>
eating you up.

371
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:56,832
You don't care
that he's a demon.

372
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:58,383
Heck,
<i>you've</i> been a demon.

373
00:21:58,385 --> 00:21:59,385
We've all been demons.

374
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:02,337
No,
it's that he's with me

375
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:04,639
and he's having
the time of his life.

376
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:07,142
You can't stand the fact
that he's mine.

377
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:08,593
He's not your pet.

378
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:09,478
My pet?

379
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,179
He's my best friend,

380
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:12,430
my partner in crime.

381
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:15,350
They'll write songs about us,
graphic novels.

382
00:22:15,352 --> 00:22:18,236
“The Misadventures
of Growley and Squirrel.”

383
00:22:18,238 --> 00:22:20,405
Dean Winchester
completes me,

384
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:23,525
and that's what makes you
lose your chickens.

385
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:25,026
I am going to find you,

386
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:28,830
I am going to save
my brother,

387
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:31,583
and then
I'm going to kill you dead.

388
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:33,835
Well, that's
the operative phrase, isn't it?

389
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:35,537
“Find you.”

390
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:37,873
good luck with that.

391
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:55,128
Daniel.

392
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:02,135
What
are you fishing for?

393
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:05,389
Trout, mostly.

394
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:07,474
They do love
a good curlytail grub.

395
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:11,311
Trick is to find
that special spot

396
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:12,813
just outside the run,

397
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:13,815
where the big ones --

398
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:17,901
the smart ones --
are holding low.

399
00:24:19,822 --> 00:24:22,623
Do they -- do they put up
much of a fight?

400
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:27,928
The ones
who truly want to be free?

401
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,162
They do.

402
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:32,899
You're here
about our brother who died.

403
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:35,385
Does that surprise you?
I can assure you...

404
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:38,338
Had he just left us alone,
no one would've been harmed.

405
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,474
His orders were
to<i> not</i> leave you alone.

406
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:41,391
And you killed him.

407
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:43,910
And heaven sends
two more.

408
00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:45,395
What is it
about us angels

409
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:47,514
that we can't seem
to get the message?

410
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:50,117
Perhaps it is you who has failed
to get the message?

411
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:53,203
All of us serve
at heaven's command.

412
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:55,072
I suppose.

413
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:58,325
But that was before the fall,
wasn't it?

414
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:04,164
You are an angel,
once and forever.

415
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:07,668
Dropped unwillingly...

416
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,703
Unknowingly...

417
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:11,338
Into a strange land,

418
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,174
a land that,
as it turns out,

419
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:18,679
celebrates the free,
the individual.

420
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:20,714
For the first time
in thousands of years,

421
00:25:20,716 --> 00:25:23,050
I have choices.

422
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:26,386
And with each choice...

423
00:25:26,388 --> 00:25:28,555
I begin to discover
who I really am.

424
00:25:28,557 --> 00:25:29,639
This is nonsense.

425
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:31,258
Because they don't
teach you this in heaven?

426
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,809
Perhaps they should.

427
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:35,195
Then you would understand
why it's worth fighting for.

428
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:38,699
He's taunting us.

429
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:40,567
And then what?

430
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:42,285
We kill him?

431
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,871
Or he kills us?

432
00:25:44,873 --> 00:25:46,289
There are orders.

433
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,541
And there is time.

434
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:49,409
To hear more of this?

435
00:25:49,411 --> 00:25:52,412
To convince him
to do the right thing.

436
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:54,898
Besides, Hannah,

437
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,967
we still don't even know
where the other one is --

438
00:25:56,969 --> 00:26:00,220
the woman.

439
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,726
You'll have to stay
for sunset.

440
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:09,813
Nighttime around here
is a revelation.

441
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:12,516
You sent those demons
to kill me?

442
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:14,101
To keep you sharp.

443
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:16,403
Really?

444
00:26:16,405 --> 00:26:18,438
If it wasn't for me
throwing demon chum your way,

445
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,073
what do you think
would've happened?

446
00:26:20,075 --> 00:26:21,274
The mark needs
to be sated.

447
00:26:21,276 --> 00:26:23,443
Otherwise --
otherwise, I turn into a demon.

448
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:24,411
Yeah, yeah.

449
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:26,663
I sort of got that
six weeks ago.

450
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,749
Just trying to help.

451
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:31,451
You lied.

452
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:33,420
Who do you think
you're talking to here?

453
00:26:33,422 --> 00:26:35,455
Does the tin man have
a sheet-metal Willy?

454
00:26:35,457 --> 00:26:36,423
Of course I lied.

455
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:38,458
Okay.

456
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,627
Hey.
Sit down.

457
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:41,762
Sit.

458
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:48,769
I needed to keep you sharp
for our future,

459
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:50,470
about which
we need to talk.

460
00:26:50,472 --> 00:26:51,472
Our future?

461
00:26:51,473 --> 00:26:53,023
Our professional future.

462
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:56,309
How to put this?

463
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:58,278
If I have to spend
one more night

464
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,031
in this fetid petri dish
of broken dreams and B.O.,

465
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,983
I will cut off
my own face.

466
00:27:02,985 --> 00:27:04,985
I don't know
what you're talking about.

467
00:27:04,987 --> 00:27:06,203
'Cause I'm good.

468
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:07,821
Hell, I'm great.

469
00:27:07,823 --> 00:27:08,789
Really?

470
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,324
How many suicide wings
<i>can</i> you eat?

471
00:27:11,326 --> 00:27:13,994
How many one-hit wonders
can you karaoke to death?

472
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:18,915
Okay, see, the deal was
we howl at the moon --

473
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:22,836
no time stamp,
no expiration date.

474
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:23,970
We've howled.

475
00:27:23,972 --> 00:27:25,088
We've bayed.

476
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,474
W-we've done extraordinary
things to triplets,

477
00:27:27,476 --> 00:27:29,676
all of which have been
massively entertaining.

478
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:31,511
I will treasure
our Flickr albums forever.

479
00:27:31,513 --> 00:27:34,981
But now it's time for us
to accept what we are

480
00:27:34,983 --> 00:27:37,400
and go back to work.

481
00:27:38,904 --> 00:27:39,986
Pass.

482
00:27:41,824 --> 00:27:42,989
Think of it --

483
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:46,159
the king of hell,
Dean Winchester by his side.

484
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:47,161
Together we rule.

485
00:27:47,162 --> 00:27:50,831
Together we create
the perfect hell.

486
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:55,702
And all of this that's
bloomed between us never ends.

487
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:57,754
We're not ending
the party.

488
00:27:57,756 --> 00:28:00,157
We're just moving
the party.

489
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,294
Out with the club circuit,
in with the stadium tour.

490
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:09,883
Oh.

491
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:12,719
Did I forget to mention
I spoke to moose earlier?

492
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:15,806
What?

493
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:17,107
Yes.

494
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:19,392
Uh, apparently, he's been
tracking us for some time now.

495
00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:22,195
He got my text
from the cell of that demon

496
00:28:22,197 --> 00:28:24,865
that you stabbed
in blah, blah, blah.

497
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:27,067
It was --

498
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:30,453
words were spoken --
emotions.

499
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:32,155
I realize,
in retrospect,

500
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:35,458
perhaps too many words,
too many emotions.

501
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,493
He traced the call.

502
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:37,744
My bad.

503
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:41,298
I guess he'll be here
by morning -- the latest.

504
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,649
You sold me out.

505
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:44,584
Well,
that's just lovely.

506
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,389
I don't know
what's going on with you.

507
00:28:49,391 --> 00:28:50,391
I truly don't.

508
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:52,893
But I've had just about
enough of it.

509
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:54,094
Sold you out?

510
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:56,012
Try “doing you a favor.”

511
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:58,098
everything I've done for you
for the past six months --

512
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,151
the mark, the First Blade,
midwifing you back to life,

513
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:03,236
offering you a seat
by my side --

514
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:08,658
has been a favor, a gift,
whether you see it or you don't.

515
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:11,778
Take the night.

516
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,747
Decide.

517
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:15,448
You know
where to find me.

518
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,330
Hey.

519
00:30:09,171 --> 00:30:10,754
Need some help?

520
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:11,721
Uh...

521
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,223
Yeah.
I-I think so.

522
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:15,475
It just died on me.
Out here?

523
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:16,893
Yeah.

524
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:18,261
Your ride really
has it out for you, huh?

525
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:20,847
I guess so.

526
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:22,349
Give you a hand
with that?

527
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:26,236
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd appreciate it. Yeah.

528
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:27,904
Thanks.

529
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,490
Ah...

530
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:33,076
These new cars and
their computerized brains, huh?

531
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:35,912
One zero out of place, and
the whole thing just goes kaput.

532
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,750
Well, right there.
There's your problem.

533
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:42,168
What the hell is that?

534
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,370
Well,
that's a kill switch.

535
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:45,538
This here
is the remote.

536
00:30:52,881 --> 00:30:55,281
Guessing
you're a righty.

537
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:14,205
? imaginary lovers ?

538
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:17,041
? never turn you down ?

539
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,426
- Tone deaf! Awful!
- Enough!

540
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:22,263
? When all the others
turn you away ?

541
00:31:22,265 --> 00:31:23,798
? they're around ?

542
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,689
? it's my private pleasure ?

543
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:34,892
? midnight fantasy ?

544
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:38,229
? someone to share ?

545
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:42,233
? my wildest dreams with me ?

546
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:44,235
You all suck.

547
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:47,455
? Imaginary lover ?

548
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,993
? You're mine anytime ?

549
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:57,081
? imaginary lover ?

550
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:01,218
? you're mine anytime ?

551
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,421
? mm, mm, mm ?

552
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:09,176
Drink, tough guy.

553
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,762
Nah, I'm good.

554
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:17,268
Your funeral.

555
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,569
Mm.

556
00:32:18,571 --> 00:32:20,021
What?

557
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,658
Let's go somewhere,
you and me.

558
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,444
We<i> are</i> somewhere.

559
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:27,995
No.

560
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:32,166
Somewhere else.

561
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:34,335
Sweetie...

562
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:36,420
We barely know
each other.

563
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:37,588
And you're drunk.

564
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,759
Yeah, but, uh...

565
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:44,795
I-I protected your honor,
didn't I?

566
00:32:46,683 --> 00:32:50,685
Yeah.
I thought so, too.

567
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:54,972
Seeing you take on Matt,
I was like, “wow”"

568
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,725
no one's ever done that
for me before.

569
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,444
But then you kept going
and going,

570
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:03,698
and I realized
whatever is going on with you

571
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,901
has nothing to do
with my “honor” at all.

572
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:09,870
Hm.

573
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:12,239
You got all that
from a bar fight?

574
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,991
Wow.

575
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,292
You're good.

576
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:17,328
I wait tables
at a roadhouse.

577
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,997
I meet the bad guys.
I meet the good guys.

578
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,549
And maybe
for a second there,

579
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:23,918
I thought you were
a good guy playing bad.

580
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,420
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

581
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:29,140
Maybe you're just --

582
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:30,758
The kind of guy who sleeps
with every skank

583
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,561
in every small-town dive
that he passes through?

584
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:38,683
Well, you really do know
how to read people,

585
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:41,435
'cause that sure as hell
sounds like me.

586
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:48,526
Now, see?

587
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:50,911
I'm so screwed up myself

588
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:52,113
I'm gonna walk
out of here

589
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,864
thinking
I actually deserved that.

590
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:09,213
What I'll never understand

591
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:11,515
is why angels
won't acknowledge

592
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:15,052
the wisdom
to be found down here.

593
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,688
What wisdom is to be gained
from humans?

594
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,608
I'm not speaking
to you.

595
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:25,112
Do you understand
what he's...

596
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:26,280
Fine.

597
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:28,899
But if you are
to be free,

598
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,901
that is to be decided
by all angels.

599
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,738
There's
that angelic irony.

600
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,489
We're not going
back there.

601
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,410
Not ever.

602
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:40,911
Adina.

603
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,214
This is Hannah
and Castiel.

604
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:46,300
Stow the blade,
please.

605
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,505
When she stows hers.

606
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:53,841
Hannah,
what are you doing?

607
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,760
We'll never get a chance
to argue our freedom

608
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,428
from a prison cell.

609
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,096
You should've thought of that before
slaughtering one of your own.

610
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,432
No, no.
We were talking.

611
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:02,767
We were getting
somewhere.

612
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,101
Okay, everybody just --
You want to be free?

613
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,904
Go ahead.
Be free.

614
00:35:06,906 --> 00:35:07,906
Hannah.

615
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:14,361
Stop this.

616
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,783
No.

617
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,050
Daniel.

618
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:27,758
No!

619
00:35:32,515 --> 00:35:33,597
Aah!

620
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:45,976
We have to get her.

621
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,147
She's gone.

622
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,148
We have to.
Hannah.

623
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,117
It's over.

624
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:02,993
Let's go.
Let's go.

625
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:05,996
Okay.
Home, sweet home.

626
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,596
Breathe.

627
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:30,354
There you go.

628
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:32,439
You good, partner?

629
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:35,075
How's
that chicken wing?

630
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:36,660
Who are you?

631
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:41,832
First time I broke
my arm,

632
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:43,784
my older brother,
Davey,

633
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:45,920
had me riding on the handles
of his three-speed.

634
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:48,539
Decided to pop us
a wheelie,

635
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:52,509
look real fancy for all the
little pretties outside the DQ.

636
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:56,046
Well, we were looking
mighty good for a little bit.

637
00:36:56,799 --> 00:37:00,384
And then, “whoop”"

638
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:01,969
ass end
over teakettle, boy.

639
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:05,055
Hurt like
a son of a bitch.

640
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:13,030
You're
Sam Winchester.

641
00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:14,949
I think we both can agree
on that.

642
00:37:15,785 --> 00:37:17,868
And your older brother,
Dean, well...

643
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:23,574
He and I,
we go way back.

644
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:27,995
You're a hunter?

645
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:29,713
Sure.

646
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,415
Yeah,
we can go with that.

647
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,584
Hunting your brother counts,
right?

648
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:36,671
I wouldn't do that.

649
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,422
Yeah.

650
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,341
Trust me.

651
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:42,927
Look, buddy, I-I don't know
who you are, all right?

652
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:45,846
I don't what you want
or what my brother did,

653
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:49,600
but if you got any sense,
I suggest you turn tail

654
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:51,986
and run back
to that army recruiting ad

655
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:54,405
that spit you out
in the first place.

656
00:37:55,908 --> 00:37:57,942
He's a monster.

657
00:37:57,944 --> 00:38:00,277
Well, he was.

658
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,947
Yeah, he was...

659
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:04,782
Many, many moons ago.

660
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:11,338
But now he's prey.

661
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,960
And I'm the monster now.

662
00:38:32,965 --> 00:38:35,548
We have to report this.

663
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,350
And say what?

664
00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:39,302
Things got
out of control?

665
00:38:39,304 --> 00:38:43,306
Another angel has died.

666
00:38:43,308 --> 00:38:44,774
He was going to kill me,
Castiel.

667
00:38:44,776 --> 00:38:47,611
They just wanted
to be left alone.

668
00:38:49,982 --> 00:38:54,618
Without rules,
there is chaos.

669
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:59,873
Out of chaos rise angels
like Naomi, Bartholomew...

670
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:02,626
Metatron.

671
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,248
Well, perhaps
I've been down here with them

672
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,417
for too long.

673
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:16,056
There's seemingly nothing
but chaos.

674
00:39:16,058 --> 00:39:19,225
But not all bad comes
from it.

675
00:39:19,227 --> 00:39:21,311
Art.

676
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:23,313
Hope.

677
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:24,481
Love.

678
00:39:24,483 --> 00:39:26,816
Dreams.

679
00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:30,570
But t-those
are human things.

680
00:39:36,495 --> 00:39:39,579
Yes.

681
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:56,046
I left you an open tab
at the bar.

682
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:58,381
Knock yourself out.

683
00:39:58,383 --> 00:40:00,467
Well, hell, I just may
take you up on that.

684
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:02,552
And who is this?

685
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:03,470
Me?

686
00:40:03,472 --> 00:40:05,638
Well, I'm karma,
brother.

687
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,690
On my brother's phone?

688
00:40:06,692 --> 00:40:08,191
On your brother's phone.

689
00:40:09,978 --> 00:40:11,311
Is he dead?

690
00:40:11,313 --> 00:40:13,947
No. Not yet.

691
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:16,316
And as long as you show up
where I tell you to show up,

692
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:17,817
your brother will be
just fine.

693
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:20,870
And how do I know
he's still alive?

694
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:27,293
Speak.

695
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,303
Aah!

696
00:40:37,305 --> 00:40:38,838
Proof of life.

697
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,090
Dean!

698
00:40:40,092 --> 00:40:41,141
Got a pen?

699
00:40:41,143 --> 00:40:42,726
No, you listen to me.

700
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:43,927
There's no trade.

701
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:46,763
There's no meet-up.
There's no nothing --

702
00:40:46,765 --> 00:40:51,568
except the 100% guarantee
that, somewhere down the road,

703
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,771
I will find you,
and I will kill you.

704
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:58,858
Well, that'll be a cold comfort
to your dead brother.

705
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,443
I told him to let me go.

706
00:41:00,445 --> 00:41:03,780
So whatever jam he's in now,
that is his problem.

707
00:41:03,782 --> 00:41:05,832
Yeah, well, I'll be sure
to pass that on to him

708
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:07,167
as I'm slitting
his throat.

709
00:41:07,169 --> 00:41:10,036
Yeah, you do that,
'cause he knows me.

710
00:41:10,038 --> 00:41:13,840
And he knows damn sure
that if I am one thing,

711
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:16,676
I am a man of my word.
