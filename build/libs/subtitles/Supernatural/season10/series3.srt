1
00:00:01,663 --> 00:00:02,663
Open your eyes, Dean.

2
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:04,931
Let's go take a howl
at that moon.

3
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:06,800
Heaven needs your help.
Anything.

4
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:09,313
Daniel and Adina --
they must be found.

5
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:10,641
They must be brought home,

6
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,177
and they must be punished
for the sake of all.

7
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,585
Think of it --

8
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:17,353
the King of Hell,
Dean Winchester by his side.

9
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:19,190
Together, we rule.

10
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:22,002
Together, we create
the perfect hell.

11
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:26,063
And all of this that's bloomed
between us never ends.

12
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:27,892
Hey! don't turn your back
on me!

13
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,606
- What do you think you're doing?
- Oh, whatever I want.

14
00:00:30,608 --> 00:00:31,834
You're here for Dean.

15
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:33,253
I'm here
to give him to you.

16
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:35,269
The little prat's
bad for business.

17
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:36,957
He's uncontrollable.
Must be the Mark.

18
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:39,485
Your<i> pal</i> Crowley
sold you out.

19
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:41,246
We know how to cure demons.
You remember that?

20
00:00:41,248 --> 00:00:42,910
Little Latin,
lot of blood.

21
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:44,842
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna kill me?

22
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,399
You are my brother,
and I'm here to take you home.

23
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:48,763
You really think
those are gonna work?

24
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:54,059
Stop! It's over!

25
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:55,560
It's over, Dean.

26
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:08,417
<i> Hunc sanguinem sacro,</i>
<i>et donantibus sanguinem,</i>

27
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:09,751

30
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:24,596
Doctor.

31
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:26,129
Father.

32
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,614
Really?

33
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:19,775
For whatever it's worth,

34
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:22,211
I got your blood type.

35
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,445
Sam, I know you think
you're gonna try and fix me,

36
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:27,675
but did it ever
occur to you

37
00:02:27,677 --> 00:02:29,274
that maybe I don't want
to be fixed?

38
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:30,905
Just let me
go live my life.

39
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:33,476
I won't bother you.

40
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:35,003
What do you care?

41
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,207
What do I care?

42
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,579
<i>Ritum sacrum...</i>

43
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,146
<i>Hanc terram consecro.</i>

44
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,317
You think I'm just
gonna sit here like Crowley,

45
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:49,546
getting all weepy
while you shoot me up?

46
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:51,480
Well, screw that.

47
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:53,079
I don't want this.

48
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:54,910
Yeah, I pretty much
figured that out.

49
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:56,980
You don't even know
if this is gonna work, do you?

50
00:02:56,982 --> 00:02:59,249
You know, I got a hell of a lot more
running through me

51
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:01,079
than just demon juice.

52
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,614
Mark of Cain -- got it.

53
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,916
That's right.

54
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,810
Buckle up.

55
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,743
Sammy...

56
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:11,013
You know I hate shots.

57
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:16,047
I hate demons.

58
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:27,878
Look, we got a whole bunch more
of these to go.

59
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,214
You could make it
a lot easier on yourself.

62
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,805
How are you holding up?

63
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,340
Fine.

64
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:29,879
You say you're fine,

65
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:33,045
but you don't<i> look</i> fine.

66
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:34,813
It's what the humans do.

67
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:37,011
They<i> say</i> they're fine,

68
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:39,346
and even if I-I don't look it,
you say I look well,

69
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:41,016
and in that way,

70
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:43,848
we avoid talking about something
we can do nothing about.

71
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,488
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,958
I just can't see
how Sam Winchester could ask you

73
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,327
to drive all this way
to help with his brother,

74
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,064
knowing your condition.

75
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:01,502
He doesn't know...

76
00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:03,932
about how badly
your borrowed Grace is fading,

77
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,203
does he?

78
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,666
Mm. He knows some.

79
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,601
And he didn't have to ask.

80
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,768
Sam is alone in this.

81
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,775
He's attempting to change Dean
from demon to human

82
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:17,838
with a cure
of sanctified blood,

83
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,844
but...there's no guarantee
that will work.

84
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:25,610
If it doesn't,
then Dean is gone,

85
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:28,816
and the demon
must be dealt with.

86
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,720
I just...

87
00:05:35,722 --> 00:05:37,488
I worry about you.

88
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,310
For all you know,
you could be killing me.

89
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:08,613
Or...

90
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:11,317
You're just messing
with me.

91
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,757
Either way,
the lore doesn't say anything

92
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,694
about exceptions
to the cure.

93
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:19,200
“The Lore.”

94
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:21,769
hunters...
Men of Letters.

95
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:25,642
What a load of crap
it all is.

96
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,409
Oh, you got nothin'?

97
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:31,410
You want me
to debate you?

98
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:34,379
This isn't even the real you
I'm talking to.

99
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,251
Oh, it's the real me,
all right.

100
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:38,354
The<i> new</i> real me --

101
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,185
the me that sees things
for what they really are.

102
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:47,420
Winchesters -- do-gooders --
fighting the natural order.

103
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:48,851
Let me tell you
something --

104
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:51,259
guys like me,
we<i> are</i> the natural order.

105
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:52,858
It's the way
it was set up.

106
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,297
Guys like me
still got to do what we can.

107
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:58,224
don't be so full of yourself,
Sammy.

108
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:00,031
'Cause, see,
from where I'm sitting,

109
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,463
there ain't much difference

110
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:03,495
from what I turned into
to what you already are.

111
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:05,032
And what exactly
is that supposed to mean?

112
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:07,169
I know what you did
when you went looking for me.

113
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:08,977
I know how far you went.

114
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:11,410
Crowley told me
all about it.

115
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:13,779
So, let me ask you...

116
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:18,222
...which one of us
is really a monster?

117
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:19,590
Hmm?

118
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:23,390
Starting to come back
to you now?

119
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:34,328
What am I supposed to do now?

120
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,336
It's like
my life is over.

121
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:39,702
Thank you.

122
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:43,101
Bitch.

123
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,972
I should've seen it coming.

124
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:49,539
Why doesn't<i> anything</i>
ever work out for me?

125
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,507
Huh?

126
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:53,443
Hey, there.

127
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:54,443
Hi.

128
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:56,851
Sounds like, uh...

129
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,714
Things have been a little rough
on you lately, huh?

130
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,554
Rough?

131
00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:03,724
My wife
kicked me to the curb.

132
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,797
Oh.

133
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,293
We haven't had sex
for four months.

134
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:09,933
Four.

135
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:14,165
Well, not that -- not that
she hasn't been having plenty...

136
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:18,604
With a guy
in her bowling league --

137
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:19,940
guy with tattoos.

138
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,812
Did him right there
on the kitchen table

139
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:24,212
while I was at work.

140
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:26,348
Man.

141
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,686
That's, uh...
That's cold.

142
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:33,558
Now all I think of
is revenge...

143
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,390
Payback.

144
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:39,695
But that's
not gonna happen.

145
00:08:39,697 --> 00:08:42,368
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

146
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:52,638
It<i> is</i> possible that you can...
have your revenge.

147
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,309
I mean, hell,
it's possible

148
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:57,580
you can have
pretty much anything you want.

149
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:01,548
You were trying
to get a 20 on Crowley and me

150
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,188
from any demon
you could snag.

151
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:07,220
But Crowley
didn't want to be found,

152
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:09,860
and no one showed
when you summoned.

153
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:12,796
But you find a way,
didn't you, Sam?

154
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:22,173
All right.
Stand right here.

155
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,509
When I say so,
read the words off the paper.

156
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,275
A-are you sure
about this?

157
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:29,779
Yeah. Trust me.

158
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:32,444
All right. Go ahead.

159
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,748
Okay, um...

160
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:41,292
<i>Demon esto subiectus</i>
<i>voluntari --</i>

161
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:43,020
<i>tati! Voluntati!</i>

162
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:46,764
Oh --<i> voluntati.</i>

163
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:49,659
Who summons me,
and for what purpose?

164
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:55,835
Kill my wife...

165
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:56,837
Lester!

166
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:58,372
...and my soul is yours.

167
00:09:58,374 --> 00:09:59,805
Don't!
Done.

168
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,741
No!

169
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:02,277
You would have liked

170
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,014
to have gotten there
before the deal went down,

171
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:08,380
but you didn't really care
about poor ol' Lester, did you?

172
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:14,015
Why don't we try that
again?

173
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:17,317
Nobody knows where Crowley
and your brother are.

174
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,860
They're off the radar!

175
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:38,740
Aah!

176
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:40,940
Kill me if you want to!

177
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:43,612
That's all I know.

178
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,317
I got nothing for you.

179
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:51,886
And you made that poor
son of a bitch sell his soul.

180
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:56,222
Oh, and so you know,
I killed Lester myself.

181
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:58,462
And that wife of his
married the tattooed guy.

182
00:10:58,464 --> 00:11:00,325
I never meant --

183
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,893
Who cares
what you meant?!

184
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,564
That line that we thought
was so clear

185
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:07,363
between us
and the things that we hunted

186
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,603
ain't so clear,
is it?

187
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:11,635
Wow.

188
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,075
You might actually
be worse than<i> me.</i>

189
00:11:14,077 --> 00:11:18,313
I mean, you took a guy
at his lowest, used him,

190
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:22,145
and it cost him his life
<i>and</i> his soul.

191
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:23,985
Nice work.

192
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:27,155
Aah!

193
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:42,670
Let me ask you this,
Sammy.

194
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:45,945
If this doesn't work...

195
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:49,346
We both know what you got to do
to me, right?

196
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:53,584
You got the stomach
for that, Sam?!

197
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:08,013
You stand accused
of high treason.

198
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,701
Take her away.

199
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:15,046
So, what's this, then?

200
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,911
Oh, goody --
something else to sign.

201
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:21,951
“Henceforth and forthwith...

202
00:12:21,953 --> 00:12:24,952
“For the furtherance

203
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:28,056
and expedience
and regulation and...”

204
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:29,896
yeah.

205
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:31,560
Sure.

206
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:37,030
Majesty,
supplicants await without.

207
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:39,132
Without what?

208
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:41,868
Outside.

209
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,636
Let them wait.

210
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,908
They've waited
a long time.

211
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,740
It's Hell. You wait.

212
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:50,074
It's what you do.

213
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:53,914
You're still here.

214
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,779
I have an update
on the angel Castiel.

215
00:12:57,918 --> 00:13:00,190
His Grace
seems to be fading.

216
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,960
He's losing strength.

217
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,296
If one were so inclined,

218
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:08,968
this would be a propitious time
for one to eliminate him.

219
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,663
“One”?

220
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,071
You, sire.

221
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:17,860
Borrowed Grace does have
a puny shelf life.

222
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,027
Castiel should have read
the warning label.

223
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:21,699
Follow him.

224
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:25,003
And keep me informed
as to his decline.

225
00:13:34,353 --> 00:13:35,783
What's going on here?

226
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:37,919
What's it look like?
In my bed?!

227
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:39,919
Jerk.
Bitch.

228
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:42,024
Knock it down. Knock it down!
Stop talking!

229
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:44,130
You're bodging it!
Yeah!

230
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:47,234
The King of Hell,
Dean Winchester by his side.

231
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:48,530
Together, we rule.

232
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:52,435
Together, we create
the perfect Hell.

233
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:56,442
Great one?

234
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:01,010
Your majesty?

235
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:02,882
Are you...all right?

236
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:06,146
I was thinking
of better days.

237
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:08,355
Yes --
your sabbatical.

238
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:09,492
My what?

239
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:11,357
Uh, we were worried,
of course.

240
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:13,861
Your misadventure
with the older Winchester

241
00:14:13,863 --> 00:14:17,133
was quite
the topic of speculation.

242
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:22,164
Uh, if you'll forgive
my boldness...

243
00:14:23,174 --> 00:14:26,340
<i>I</i> could now be
your wingman.

244
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:28,373
Could you?

245
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,981
I, too, love to party,

246
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:33,782
and I do love the ladies

247
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,550
and the classic
rock 'n' roll.

248
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:38,020
Most importantly,
I can debauch by your side

249
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:39,883
without being
a personal embarrassment.

250
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:43,382
You'll see
what I'm worth.

251
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,684
Oh, I can see already.

252
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:56,588
Anyone else care to comment?

253
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:07,691
Sorry.
I...missed another turn.

254
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:13,561
I have no idea
where the main road is.

255
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:14,825
These things --

256
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:18,629
they're so confining
and primitive.

257
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:20,492
It's --

258
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,700
it's getting worse,
isn't it?

259
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,970
Castiel, it's time
we stopped avoiding the obvious.

260
00:15:28,972 --> 00:15:31,167
You and I both know
how to fix this --

261
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:32,902
both you
and the situation.

262
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:35,003
I will not slit
some angel's throat

263
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:36,570
and steal its Grace.

264
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:38,136
Before you say it,

265
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,904
we definitely are not going
begging to Metatron.

266
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,209
What about
helping your friend

267
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,841
and sending the rogue angels
back to heaven?

268
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:49,281
Your preference to die
for your principles --

269
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,417
it's very noble,
but it is meaningless.

270
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:53,648
Then<i> you</i> carry on.

271
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,551
I'm not enough.

272
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:59,018
Sometimes, enough is
whatever you have.

273
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:17,627
Sam?

274
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:19,396
Cass.

275
00:16:19,398 --> 00:16:21,028
Hey,
are you still coming?

276
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,165
I'm a few hours away.

277
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,236
Is the treatment
working?

278
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:26,068
No, not very well.

279
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,108
Look, I-it's not
like it was with Crowley.

280
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,603
Dean's in pain.

281
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:30,875
I mean,
he's in bad pain.

282
00:16:30,877 --> 00:16:33,247
I-it's like
he's barely holding on.

283
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:39,126
Cass...
I might be killing him.

284
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,433
It might be.

285
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:44,803
So...What?
Should I stop?

286
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:45,876
And do what?

287
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:48,246
He's not possessed.

288
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:50,781
Exorcism is
out of the question.

289
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:55,449
The ritual of purified blood
is the only treatment I know.

290
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:58,511
Cass, did you not hear
what I just said?

291
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:00,983
I could be killing
my brother.

292
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:03,254
Sam, he's<i> not</i> your brother --
at least not now.

293
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,990
You have to be
prepared for --

294
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,989
Killing my brother.

295
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:12,091
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

296
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:13,563
Yeah, all right.

297
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,291
I'll, uh, I'll leave the entry
unlocked for you.

298
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:16,795
Just hurry.

299
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,342
Hey! Hey!

300
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,942
Dean! Come on!

301
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:28,445
- Come back.
- No.

302
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,613
Come back to me.
You there? Hey!

303
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:32,980
Dean, you okay?

304
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,085
Yeah, if you...
Consider

305
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:40,525
drowning in your own sweat
while your blood boils okay.

306
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:46,224
Look,
I can't stop doing this.

307
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:47,360
Sure you can.

308
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:49,960
You just stop.

309
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:52,359
There's no point in trying
to bring your brother back now.

310
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:53,959
Oh, I<i> will</i>
bring him back.

311
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:55,799
In fact, your, uh,

312
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:59,399
guilt-ridden,
weight-of-the-world bro

313
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:02,007
has been M.I.A.
for quite some time now.

314
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:04,103
But I'm loving
the new model --

315
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:07,710
lean, mean Dean.

316
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,508
Right.

317
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,274
You notice I tried to get as far away
from you as possible?

318
00:18:12,276 --> 00:18:15,681
Away from your whining,
your complaining.

319
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:18,512
I chose the King of Hell
over you.

320
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:23,248
Maybe I was just...
tired of babysitting you

321
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,222
or always having to yank
your lame ass out of the fire

322
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:27,853
since  forever.

323
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:30,325
Or maybe --

324
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:33,230
maybe it was the fact that
my mother would still be alive

325
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:35,263
if it wasn't for you.

326
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:42,366
That your very existence
sucked the life out of my life.

327
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:45,638
This isn't
my brother talking.

328
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,606
You never<i> had</i> a brother --

329
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:50,344
just an excuse
for not manning up.

330
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:51,984
But guess what.

331
00:18:51,986 --> 00:18:52,986
I quit.

332
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:54,586
No. No, you don't.

333
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:56,753
You don't get to quit.

334
00:18:56,755 --> 00:18:59,154
We don't get to quit
in this family.

335
00:18:59,156 --> 00:19:01,364
This family is
all we have ever had!

336
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:03,595
Well, then,
we got nothin'.

337
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:04,827
Would you say that
to dad?

338
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:07,867
Dad?
Oh,<i> there's</i> a prize.

339
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:11,667
Here's a man who brainwashed us
into wasting our lives

340
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:14,075
fighting
his losing battle.

341
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:15,939
Oh. Ooh.

342
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:18,347
Is this you manning up?

343
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:24,084
This is me yanking<i> your</i> lame ass
out of the fire.

344
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:31,658
You're welcome.

345
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,925
You have coerced others
into aligning with Abaddon.

346
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:52,892
You've spread rumors
and fostered doubt

347
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:55,394
as to the competence
and authority of the crown.

348
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,630
Guilty of treason.

349
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:00,661
The sentence is death.

350
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:06,097
Anyone else hungry to betray me?

351
00:20:07,932 --> 00:20:09,466
Next.

352
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:16,614
You're guilty of...something,

353
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:19,312
which I won't tolerate,
whatever it was.

354
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:21,122
You are condemned to --

355
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:23,986
Stop! Stop!

356
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:25,194
Stop?

357
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:26,659
You cannot do this.

358
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:29,163
Weren't you watching?
'Course I can. I just did.

359
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:31,499
This is
your idea of ruling?

360
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:32,731
Yes.

361
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,835
We've killed and tortured
for you,

362
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:37,307
stolen souls,
destroyed lives,

363
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:40,611
tempted and tormented
with distinction.

364
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:42,907
And for all this,
what's our reward?

365
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,313
A slap in the face.

366
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:50,342
What is it?

367
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:53,247
You disappear,
binge on blood,

368
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:55,615
approach the edge
of becoming human.

369
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:56,919
And the salt in the wound --
you run off

370
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:58,055
with your boy toy,
Dean Winchester,

371
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,558
and now
he's running amok,

372
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,189
and you can't control him
<i>or</i> the kingdom.

373
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:03,261
What's he doing?

374
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,060
You've squandered
our loyalty.

375
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:07,796
What will you do?

376
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:10,164
Not live in the Hell
you've made.

377
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:14,164
It's holy oil!

378
00:21:18,204 --> 00:21:20,402
Get back! Get back!

379
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:27,842
Gaaaaaaaaah!

380
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:33,449
Did not see that coming.

381
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,255
Huh.

382
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:47,892
Um, Hannah.

383
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:50,057
You know,

384
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,590
this -- this road we're on,
it's -- it's dangerous.

385
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:54,723
All right.

386
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:56,995
Um...

387
00:21:56,997 --> 00:21:59,260
We can't afford
to lose our way.

388
00:21:59,262 --> 00:22:00,628
I know that.

389
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,005
I'm sorry about the map.

390
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:07,236
No detours of<i> any</i> kind.

391
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,572
Castiel,
if these are metaphors

392
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:13,580
and you're attempting
another human communication,

393
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,979
it isn't working.

394
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:20,881
I'm just trying to say
that this mission is everything.

395
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,385
I know that.

396
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:26,353
Getting to Dean
and hunting these rogues --

397
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:29,595
I -- I'm not
at full capacity,

398
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:31,298
so I...

399
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,435
We n-need total focus.

400
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,202
Like a laser.
Got it.

401
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:40,202
Just -- I've been around humans
for long enough

402
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:44,608
to see...how easily
distractions occur.

403
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:49,140
“Distractions.”

404
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:52,539
Emotions...feelings --

405
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,610
they're
dangerous temptations.

406
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:57,808
How very biblical,
Castiel.

407
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:02,415
I don't mean
to be unkind.

408
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:05,656
You don't need
to be kind.

409
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:07,224
I just...

410
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:10,321
I'm trying to keep
our priorities clear.

411
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:12,024
Not to worry, then.

412
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:14,328
I am very clear
on my priorities.

413
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,127
And yours.

414
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:41,915
Hello?

415
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,872
Hey, there.

416
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:10,176
I've been tracking you
for days.

417
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:12,416
You<i> will</i> be punished
for what you did.

418
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:15,648
Daniel's death --
that was unintentional, Adina.

419
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,720
I feel you know this.

420
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:18,120
Unintentional?

421
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:19,288
You killed him!

422
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,488
Aah!

423
00:24:22,522 --> 00:24:23,890
Seriously?

424
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:32,406
Just...kill me.

425
00:24:32,408 --> 00:24:33,806
But let her go.

426
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:35,143
Stop.

427
00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:37,648
“stop.” “kill me.”

428
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,153
I mean, so many suggestions,
I don't know what to do.

429
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:42,889
I know --
I<i> will</i> kill you, Castiel,

430
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:44,218
but very, very slowly

431
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,196
so your -- your honeybunch
can watch.

432
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:50,531
Sound good?

433
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,336
Hey, champ.

434
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,967
Look at you.

435
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,775
Talk about roadkill.

436
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:11,641
Attagirl, Hannah.
Suffer.

437
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:14,973
Just like my Daniel suffered
before you killed him.

438
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:18,339
Daniel's death isn't on<i> my</i> head.
It's on<i> yours.</i>

439
00:27:18,341 --> 00:27:19,770
We did nothing.

440
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:24,208
We wanted nothing
but to be left alone.

441
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,111
You killed an angel.
You had to answer for it.

442
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:30,078
An angel who would have hauled us
back to that heaven of yours.

443
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,647
You should have
left us alone.

444
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:36,621
And that will do.

445
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:52,802
Why can't you people
just sit on clouds

446
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,507
and play harps,
like you're supposed to?

447
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:31,680
Come on, Sam!

448
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:35,552
don't you want to hang out
with your big brother?

449
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:38,582
Spend a little quality time?

450
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:45,923
Don't be an idiot.

451
00:29:45,925 --> 00:29:48,791
Yes, it's hers, but she was
killing your girlfriend.

452
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:50,475
Your hands are clean.

453
00:29:50,477 --> 00:29:52,538
Much as it pains me
to say this,

454
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,605
you're useless to me
dead.

455
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:15,146
You owe me.

456
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:18,482
Why did you help me?

457
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,283
Purely business.

458
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,619
Since you're 5 miles away
from the Winchesters' clubhouse,

459
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:25,028
I can only surmise
that you're headed there

460
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,060
and that Dean has become
a handful.

461
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:32,266
Having him as a demon has
caused me nothing but grief.

462
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:33,969
Fix the problem.

463
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:36,833
You realize --
worse comes to worst,

464
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,634
that means killing him.

465
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:41,939
I'm not sentimental.

466
00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:49,656
Smart, Sam.

467
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,664
Locking the place down.

468
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:54,960
Doors won't open.
I get it.

469
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:57,494
But here's the thing.

470
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:01,467
I don't want to leave.

471
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:03,401
Not till I find you.

472
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:15,842
Sammy!

473
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,922
You're just making this
worse for yourself, man!

474
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:25,488
Oh, by the way,

475
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:30,455
you can, uh...blame yourself
for me getting loose.

476
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:33,094
All that blood you pumped
into me to make me human --

477
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:34,798
well

478
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,164
The less demon I was,
the less the cuffs worked.

479
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:43,332
And that Devil's Trap --

480
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:45,899
well, I just walked
right across it.

481
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:49,001
It smarted.

482
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:51,335
But still...

483
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,181
Yeah, that's more like it.

484
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,925
That's your big move?

485
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:44,264
Listen to me, Dean!

486
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:47,240
We were getting close,
okay?

487
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:49,575
I know you're still in there
somewhere.

488
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:51,839
Just let me
finish the treatments.

489
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,078
Dean?

490
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:02,619
You act like
I<i> want</i> to be cured.

491
00:34:08,268 --> 00:34:11,969
Personally,
I like the disease.

492
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:13,440
Dean! Stop that!

493
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:15,841
Look, I don't want
to use this Blade on you!

494
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:17,744
Oh!

495
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:20,247
That sucks for you,
doesn't it?

496
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:22,446
'Cause you really mean that.

497
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:25,245
Look, if you come
out of that room,

498
00:34:25,247 --> 00:34:26,485
I won't have a choice!

499
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:28,284
Sure you will!

500
00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:30,483
And I know
which one you'll make.

501
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,715
Isn't that right,
Sammy?

502
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:35,889
But, see...
Here's the thing.

503
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:37,825
I'm lucky.

504
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,192
Oh, hell, I'm blessed.

505
00:34:39,194 --> 00:34:41,159
'Cause there's
just enough demon left in me

506
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:44,158
that killing you
ain't no choice at all.

507
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,670
Sammy?

508
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:04,449
Come on, Sammy!

509
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:07,689
Let's have a beer,
talk about it.

510
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:11,057
I'm tired of playing.

511
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:14,225
Let's finish this game!

512
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:29,785
Well...Look at you.

513
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:34,524
Do it.

514
00:35:38,564 --> 00:35:39,931
It's all you.

515
00:35:51,907 --> 00:35:53,641
It's over.

516
00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:55,609
Dean, it's over.

517
00:35:57,443 --> 00:35:59,049
Aaaaah!

518
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:02,353
It's over.

519
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:19,403
What the hell
are we doing to him, Cass?

520
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:21,437
I mean, even after
I gave him all that blood,

521
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:23,510
he still said
he didn't want to be cured,

522
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:26,444
that he didn't want
to be human.

523
00:36:26,446 --> 00:36:31,010
Well...
I see his point.

524
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:35,514
You know, only humans
can feel real joy, but...

525
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:37,818
also such profound pain.

526
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,820
This is easier.

527
00:37:11,422 --> 00:37:13,661
You look worried, fellas.

528
00:37:25,805 --> 00:37:28,471
Welcome back, Dean.

529
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,107
Hey.

530
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:04,473
How's he doing?

531
00:38:04,475 --> 00:38:07,206
He's, uh...
He's still a little out of it,

532
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,835
but better, I think.

533
00:38:08,837 --> 00:38:11,170
I mean,
I think this whole thing --

534
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:13,841
the blood cure and the...
All of it --

535
00:38:13,843 --> 00:38:15,577
really wrecked him,
you know?

536
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:16,809
Yeah.

537
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:18,849
On the plus side,
he's hungry again,

538
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:21,512
so I'm just gonna go pick him up
a big ol' bag of crap food

539
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:23,649
and stuff it
in his face myself.

540
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:25,121
You mind keeping an eye?

541
00:38:26,724 --> 00:38:27,754
Yeah.

542
00:38:27,756 --> 00:38:28,786
Sam?

543
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:30,057
Yeah?

544
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,193
You realize --
one problem is solved,

545
00:38:32,195 --> 00:38:33,392
but one still remains.

546
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,495
Dean is no longer a demon.
That's true.

547
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:39,831
But the Mark of Cain --
that, he still has,

548
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,863
and sooner or later,
that's gonna be an issue.

549
00:38:41,865 --> 00:38:44,601
You know what, Cass?
I'm beat, man.

550
00:38:44,603 --> 00:38:46,706
One battle at a time,
you know?

551
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:52,112
So I'm just gonna go grab
my brother some cholesterol.

552
00:38:53,576 --> 00:38:55,749
And then
I'm gonna get drunk.

553
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:19,633
Yeah.

554
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:23,137
You look terrible.

555
00:39:24,803 --> 00:39:26,609
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to lie every now and again.

556
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:29,944
No, it wouldn't kill me.
I just...you --

557
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:31,943
Forget it.

558
00:39:31,945 --> 00:39:34,941
Well,
you, on the other hand,

559
00:39:34,943 --> 00:39:37,212
you...

560
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:38,611
Looking good.

561
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:41,513
So...are you back?

562
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:43,784
At least temporarily.

563
00:39:43,786 --> 00:39:47,917
Yeah, it's a long story --
Crowley, stolen Grace.

564
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:50,450
There's a female outside
in the car.

565
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:53,449
Another time.

566
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:58,151
Well, thank you for, um...
Stepping in when you did.

567
00:40:01,395 --> 00:40:05,329
What does Sam say?
Does he want a divorce?

568
00:40:05,331 --> 00:40:06,930
I'm sure Sam knows

569
00:40:06,932 --> 00:40:10,339
that whatever you said
or what you did,

570
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,739
that wasn't really you.

571
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:13,940
It certainly wasn't
<i>all</i> you.

572
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:16,341
I tried to kill him,
Cass.

573
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:18,677
Dean, you two have
been through so much.

574
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:21,885
Look, you're brothers.

575
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:24,253
It'd take a lot more than
trying to kill Sam with a hammer

576
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,685
to make him
want to walk away.

577
00:40:25,687 --> 00:40:27,653
You realize how screwed up
our lives are

578
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:29,358
that that even makes sense?

579
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,495
I'm glad you're here,
man.

580
00:40:38,844 --> 00:40:43,073
Hey, maybe you should,
um...take some time

581
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:45,081
before you get back to work --
allow yourself to heal.

582
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,976
It's, uh...

583
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,817
I don't know.
Timing might be right.

584
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:54,121
Heaven and Hell -- they seem
reasonably back in order.

585
00:40:54,123 --> 00:40:56,225
It's quiet out there.
