1
00:00:01,113 --> 00:00:02,935
Dean, what was that all about
back there?

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,394
All those extra shots after
the shifter was already dead.

3
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:07,395
Sure it wasn't something to do
with the Mark?

4
00:00:07,397 --> 00:00:09,430
No, no. None of that.
Look, man, I gotta be honest.

5
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:11,399
I was a little anxious. I wanted
to make sure it was done right.

6
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,101
Why am I even explaining this?
Dean, I...

7
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:17,905
How did you do it?
Magic.

8
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:19,574
We're here for the witch.
Rowena.

9
00:00:19,576 --> 00:00:20,775
Always nice to be recognized.

10
00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:22,310
<i>Impetus bestiarum.</i>

11
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:25,113
We got her.

12
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:27,115
Time for
the coup de grace.

13
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:29,183
Something the matter
with you?

14
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:30,818
Mother?

15
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,187
My name is Jimmy Novak.

16
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:34,756
I'm from Pontiac, Illinois.

17
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:37,025
I have a family --
Amelia and Claire.

18
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:39,594
Bless this food and ourselves
to thy loving service.

19
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:40,962
Amen.

20
00:00:40,964 --> 00:00:42,764
Aah!
Hi, Daddy.

21
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:44,899
You're possessing
some poor bastard?

22
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:47,301
Castiel, you promised me
my family would be okay!

23
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:50,271
What of the humans
whose lives we sacrifice?

24
00:00:50,273 --> 00:00:53,975
Maybe it's time
to put them first.

25
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:27,041
Get your hands off me, perv.

26
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:29,210
I'll sue your ass.

27
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:33,915
What was it this time?

28
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:36,250
Shoplifting. The guy
ain't lookin' to press charges,

29
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:37,718
but I figured
you'd want her back.

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,320
That's 48 hours in isolation.

31
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:41,789
Ohh. Scary.

32
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:55,703
Ugh!

33
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:06,547
Who is this girl?

34
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:08,850
One of our frequent flyers.

35
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:11,686
Claire Novak.

36
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,064
Novak, you got a visitor.

37
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:24,866
Really?

38
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:26,400
Your father's here
to see you.

39
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,273
<i>Daddy?</i>

40
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:34,208
<i>I am not your father.</i>

41
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,515
Hello, Claire.

42
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:43,985
It's been a long time.

43
00:02:43,987 --> 00:02:47,987
<font color=#00FF00>? Supernatural 10x09 ?</font>

45
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:00,759
Can we have a moment?

46
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,594
I'll be outside.

47
00:03:07,468 --> 00:03:09,201
I'm not your father.

48
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:13,639
Right.

49
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:15,941
"I'm not your father."

50
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:19,378
Those were the first words
you ever said to me. Remember?

51
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:22,915
I remember everything.

52
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:24,883
So do I, Castiel.

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,455
My dad...

54
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:32,191
Is he still in there?

55
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:34,993
No.

56
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:37,896
The human soul,
it can only occupy a body

57
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:41,300
while it retains a certain...
structural integrity.

58
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:44,069
And this vessel, it was --

59
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:45,771
it was ripped apart
on a subatomic level

60
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:47,639
by an archangel.

61
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:51,043
Well, then how are you...

62
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:53,378
I was reassembled.

63
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,980
Your father is in Heaven.

64
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:57,082
Well, yay for him.

65
00:03:57,084 --> 00:04:02,221
Anyway, good talk. You can get
the hell out of my life now.

66
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:04,223
Claire --
What?

67
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:06,358
Huh?

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,093
What?

69
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:11,263
You took everything from me.
What do you want now?

70
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:13,131
Nothing. I just...

71
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,804
I came here to help you.

72
00:04:18,806 --> 00:04:21,273
Why?

73
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:25,277
Because I've hurt you so much.

74
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:31,116
Where's your mother?

75
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:38,056
About a few months after<i> you,</i>

76
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:39,758
she took off.

77
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,795
Dropped me off at my grandma's
and went to go "find herself."

78
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,301
I guess she's still looking.

79
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:53,839
And you're in a...

80
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:55,674
Child prison?

81
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:57,576
It's a group home.

82
00:04:57,578 --> 00:05:00,479
After my gran died,
I didn't have anyone, so...

83
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:02,147
bounced around to
different foster families,

84
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:04,316
places like this.

85
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:06,718
Living the dream, you know?

86
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,090
Well, Claire,
I'm -- I'm sorry, and...

87
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:15,594
I can never replace
what I took from you,

88
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:18,997
but if there is anything
you need, anything at all...

89
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:25,604
Get me out of here.

90
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:28,040
How?

91
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:32,411
Do you own a tie?

92
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,915
Stop it.

93
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,087
There.

94
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:44,122
Now you look like a dad.

95
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,228
No, no.

96
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:54,633
So...

97
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:56,234
Mr. Novak,

98
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:59,404
I understand you want custody
of your daughter.

99
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:03,775
Yes, that's, uh, that's...

100
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:05,277
That's right.

101
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,778
Why?

102
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,247
Excuse me?

103
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:11,083
It's a simple question.

104
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:13,218
You vanish for years.

105
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,954
No contact,
not even a Christmas card.

106
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:17,456
Why come back now?

107
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:22,628
I, um -- I didn't, uh...

108
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,397
I was traveling.
For work.

109
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:30,636
Work. Yes.

110
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:32,571
Long trip.

111
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:36,675
And what is it
that you do exactly?

112
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:41,580
I...um...

113
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,618
I fight certain deadly threats
to humanity.

114
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:51,123
He's an exterminator.
I'm an exterminator.

115
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,991
Uh-huh.

116
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:58,830
You know, I think
I might have bedbugs.

117
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,332
Any tips?

118
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:01,600
Of course.

119
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:05,837
You should sleep tight
and not let them bite.

120
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,808
I'll try that.

121
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,078
It doesn't matter.

122
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,247
He's my dad,

123
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:17,849
and he wants to sign me out,
so I'm out.

124
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:19,751
That's the law, Sandy.

125
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:22,821
Claire, wait for me
in the hallway.

126
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:25,757
- You can't --
- Now.

127
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:38,804
I don't do well with liars,
Mr. Novak.

128
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:40,772
But --
save it.

129
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,176
I'm denying
your application for custody.

130
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:46,978
I'm not trying to be
the bad guy here. I'm not.

131
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,482
But until Claire turns 18,
she is my responsibility.

132
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:53,518
I know you're trying to do
what you think is best.

133
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,687
I know you wanna
be her friend.

134
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,389
I do.

135
00:07:57,391 --> 00:07:59,691
And that's our problem,
Mr. Novak.

136
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:01,093
Claire's troubled.

137
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:02,895
The last few years
have not been easy for her.

138
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:06,665
And she doesn't need a friend.
She needs a father.

139
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:13,638
<i>Easy now.</i>

140
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,073
<i>Aah!</i>
<i>Oh!</i>

141
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:22,714
What are you laughing at?

142
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:25,250
Oh.

143
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:27,319
Hey. Hang on.

144
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:29,054
It's a -- this is a classic.

145
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:30,555
I'm glad
you're feeling better.

146
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:32,324
Oh, yeah, better than ever.

147
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:37,028
Oh. Hello, beautiful.

148
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,865
Oh, yeah.

149
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,833
Mmm!

150
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:43,935
You want some alone time
with that thing?

151
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:46,371
Mnh.
No, no. Wait.

152
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:48,907
You sure?
Yeah. Yeah. Watch this.

153
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:07,025
<i>No. don't be...</i>

154
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:13,098
Hey, stop!

155
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,399
Stop!

156
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,648
It's you.

157
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,016
What's going on?

158
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:33,485
I'm getting you out of here.

159
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,893
Is he...

160
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,762
He's sleeping.

161
00:09:59,313 --> 00:10:01,880
Sit.

162
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,490
Stay.

163
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:16,428
Good dog.

164
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:19,130
Wait!

165
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:23,168
My son...

166
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,203
I need to talk to him.

167
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,408
It's been<i> weeks.</i>

168
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:35,313
Tell him I'm sorry.

169
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:38,350
Tell him --

170
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:48,026
Ugh!

171
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:53,732
Yeah?

172
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,233
Nothing.

173
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:59,337
It's just...you could eat
a vegetable.

174
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:00,939
Ketchup's a vegetable.

175
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:06,711
You've changed.

176
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:08,513
The Castiel I met?

177
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:10,615
He was crappy.

178
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:12,384
Like, super stuck-up
and a dick

179
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:15,854
and you just wanted to punch him
in his stupid angel face.

180
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:18,056
I don't think I was<i> that</i> bad.

181
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:20,558
You totally were.

182
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,128
And now you're just...

183
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,997
I don't know. Nicer.

184
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:30,669
And kind of a doof.
No offense.

185
00:11:33,073 --> 00:11:34,773
Yes. Well, um...

186
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:37,943
Before, I was
very self-assured.

187
00:11:37,945 --> 00:11:41,846
I was convinced I was on
this righteous path.

188
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:44,883
Now I realize that there is
no righteous path,

189
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,484
just people trying to do
their best

190
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:50,188
in a world where it's
far too easy to do your worst.

191
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,124
Wow. Deep.

192
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:56,094
Yeah. For a doof.

193
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:02,434
Thank you.

194
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:05,737
So...where do we go next?

195
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:09,641
Look...
I appreciate the meal.

196
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:12,744
And, you know, the felony.

197
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,245
But you don't need
to babysit me.

198
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:15,747
I can take care of myself.

199
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:17,382
What do you mean?

200
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:21,353
I mean you felt guilty,
so you busted me out.

201
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:24,155
So thanks, but we're good.

202
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:25,523
Even Steven.

203
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:28,126
No, we, um,
we committed a crime.

204
00:12:28,128 --> 00:12:30,595
And you might need me again,

205
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:32,831
so I think we should
stick together.

206
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:40,939
Okay.

207
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:43,942
You wanna get some stuff
for the road, huh?

208
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:45,643
I have to pee.

209
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:49,948
Uh, oh, okay.

210
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:54,252
Oh! My bad.
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:17,108
It's for a teenage girl.

212
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:21,579
She's urinating.

213
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,194
My wallet's gone.

214
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,501
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

215
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:46,504
Hey, can you help? Damn.

216
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:52,811
Help! Please?

217
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:54,412
Claire.
Thanks.

218
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:56,981
Go, go, go, go!

219
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:59,884
Wait! Hey! Claire!

220
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:18,071
This is why you called us?
<i>This</i> is your emergency?

221
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,990
Yes.

222
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,359
No, Cass.

223
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,927
An emergency is a dead body,
okay?

224
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,595
Or -- or --
or a wigged out angel

225
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:27,998
or the apocalypse, take 3.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,668
Some chick bolting on you
is not an emergency. That's...

227
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,004
That's every Friday night
for Sam.

228
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,206
Dude.
Well...

229
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,174
This isn't just some chick.

230
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:40,176
I'm responsible for her.

231
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:43,580
Since when? You met her once --
how many years ago?

232
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:47,517
Look, Cass, even if we do
find Claire, then what?

233
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,886
She rolled you
and then she ran, okay?

234
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,155
It's pretty clear that
she doesn't wanna play house.

235
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,523
I understand,

236
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,526
but I need to know
that Claire is safe,

237
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,361
and I need your help.

238
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,334
All right. Uh...

239
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,236
Why don't we go ask around
at the group home?

240
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,737
Uh, you know what?

241
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,172
We're gonna stick here
in case she circles back.

242
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,274
You go ahead.

243
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,443
Thank you.

244
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,320
Is ketchup a vegetable?

245
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,954
Hell, yes.

246
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,292
All right, so spill.
What's with the family reunion?

247
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:31,261
I don't know.

248
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,364
Just been...
thinking about people.

249
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,834
No problem.

250
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,704
I've helped some,
but I've -- I've hurt some.

251
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,840
So you're having
a midlife crisis.

252
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:48,178
Well, I'm extremely old.
I think I'm entitled.

253
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,217
Cass, listen to me.

254
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,386
There's some stuff
you just gotta let go.

255
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,887
Okay?

256
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:01,257
The people you let down,
the ones you can't save...

257
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,027
You gotta forget about 'em,
for your own good.

258
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,463
Is that what you do?

259
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,566
That's the opposite
of what I do. But...

260
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,701
I ain't exactly a role model.

261
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:14,738
That's not true.

262
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,608
Yeah.

263
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,145
How are you, Dean?

264
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,414
Fine.

265
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,817
I'm great.

266
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,853
No, you're not.

267
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,658
Yeah, well,
I've lost the black eyes,

268
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,727
so that's a plus.

269
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,429
But I still have this.

270
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,265
The Mark of Cain
still affecting you?

271
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,039
Dean?

272
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,748
Cass, I need you to
promise me something.

273
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,350
Of course.

274
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,987
If I do go dark side,
you gotta take me out.

275
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,889
What do you mean?

276
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,858
Knife me, smite me,
throw me into the freakin' sun.

277
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,161
Whatever.

278
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,297
And don't let Sam get
in the way, because he'll try.

279
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,302
I can't go
down that road again, man.

280
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,309
I can't be that thing again.

281
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,414
That won't work.

282
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,784
I didn't ask you,
Braveheart.

283
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,023
Freedom!

284
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,195
So...what are we in for?

285
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,632
Small talk, darling.

286
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,835
Just passing the time.

287
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,273
I'm here because
I shouldn't be here.

288
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:59,476
Is that a riddle?

289
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:04,180
Crowley only allows certain
demons to come earth-side.

290
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:07,851
I wasn't on the list, so I had
to get myself smuggled up.

291
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,520
And what did that cost?
A favor.

292
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,388
Big?
Bloody.

293
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:18,561
Now...I figure the king
lets me stew for a while,

294
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:22,866
then he starts asking how
I Houdini'd Hell.

295
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,534
And he ain't gonna ask nice.

296
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,603
Hmm.

297
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,738
What about you?

298
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,340
What's your sin?

299
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:35,278
I was a horrible mother.

300
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,847
She was a<i> horrible</i> mother.

301
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,083
Did I tell you
the time that

302
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,952
she almost traded me
for three pigs?

303
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:45,622
Three!
I was an attractive child.

304
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,890
I could juggle.

305
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,601
I was worth five pigs
at least.

306
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:50,984
My ma used to burn me
with cigarettes.

307
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:55,885
Nobody cares, Gerald.

308
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:59,536
Don't get me started
about the name.

309
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:00,803
"Fergus."

310
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,237
It sounds like
a venereal disease,

311
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,839
and not the fun kind.

312
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:09,178
Look, boss,

313
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,413
if you hate this Betty
so much,

314
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:13,048
why not end her?

315
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:17,352
I have my reasons.

316
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:21,557
Oh, I killed my old lady.

317
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,459
Because of the cigarettes.

318
00:19:25,662 --> 00:19:28,697
I have no problem
doing yours.

319
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:34,703
Claire's a good kid, Detective.
She's smart.

320
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:38,373
And underneath it all,
she has a big heart.

321
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,909
You know, there used to be
a boy here.

322
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:42,611
Dustin Tate.

323
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:45,514
He was older, but Claire
really took him under her wing.

324
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:47,850
Is he around?

325
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,218
He works at the Wiener Hut.

326
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,855
We tried to place Claire,
but she always ran away.

327
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:56,625
Sometimes for a couple of days,
one time for six months.

328
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:58,894
Wow.

329
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:00,362
Where did she hide out?

330
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:02,164
Wish I knew.

331
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:11,206
Hey, Claire.

332
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:14,142
Hey.

333
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:16,645
Is, uh, Randy here?

334
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:18,981
Oh. Look who's back.

335
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,083
It's been...What? Three days?

336
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:23,252
I know. I got busted.

337
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:26,288
But I come bearing gifts.

338
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:31,493
There's, like,
200 bucks in there.

339
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:36,932
James Novak.

340
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:38,467
Any relation?

341
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:41,370
No. He's just a guy.

342
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,338
Mm.

343
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,774
Well...
I appreciate the elbow grease,

344
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:48,443
but, uh, we're still short.

345
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:50,712
How much?

346
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:53,882
Too much.

347
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:56,518
When's Salinger coming
to collect?

348
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,453
Tonight.

349
00:20:58,455 --> 00:21:00,088
It's my fault.

350
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,657
I shouldn't have borrowed
so much money.

351
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:04,059
But, uh,
the holidays are coming,

352
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:07,663
and I like to spoil my kids.

353
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,533
Maybe he'll give us
some more time.

354
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:14,336
He's a loan shark. They're
not so big on second chances.

355
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:18,941
Kinda thought
you were gonna...

356
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:20,809
steal enough to pay down
the debt, like we talked about.

357
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:23,011
But, uh...

358
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:25,313
I tried.

359
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:27,949
Not hard enough.

360
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:35,891
Come on.

361
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:38,360
One last family meal.

362
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:41,563
There's gotta be something
we can do.

363
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:47,169
What?

364
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:50,572
It's nothin'. It's crazy.

365
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:52,874
I'd do it if I was
still under 18.

366
00:21:55,578 --> 00:21:57,212
Tell me.

367
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:08,423
Dustin Tate?

368
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:09,724
Nah, man.

369
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:11,326
Oh, really?

370
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:12,727
Yes, you are.

371
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:16,698
And you're gonna tell me
where Claire Novak is.

372
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:22,003
Now.

373
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:23,905
I'd do what he says.

374
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:38,019
<i>Quick in, quick out.</i>

375
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,023
Watch out for the cameras.

376
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:43,925
<i>Be careful.</i>

377
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,193
Wait till you're alone,

378
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:47,729
<i>then you hit</i>
<i>that register jockey hard.</i>

379
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:49,497
Put the fear of God in him.
You understand?

380
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:51,633
Good.

381
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:54,035
You come back to me,
you hear?

382
00:22:56,405 --> 00:23:00,575
You and Dustin --
you're the only family I got.

383
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:47,948
Excuse us.

384
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,750
Claire, wait!

385
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:50,886
Screw you.

386
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,553
Whoa.
Hey, Miley Cyrus, settle.

387
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:54,121
Eat me, Hasselhoff.

388
00:23:54,123 --> 00:23:55,856
Claire, hold on a second.

389
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:57,291
Look, my name's --

390
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,393
Sam. And you're Dean.

391
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:01,929
We've met, remember?

392
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:06,300
Claire.

393
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:09,170
You were going to rob
that convenience store?

394
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:11,105
So?

395
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:12,840
So?

396
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:15,376
So...It's...

397
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:16,777
Wrong.

398
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:19,547
You wanna talk to me
about wrong?

399
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:20,881
You killed my dad.

400
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:22,817
Is that wrong enough
for you?

401
00:24:24,219 --> 00:24:26,754
No, I didn't.
Really?

402
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,056
Because without you,
he'd still be here,

403
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:31,492
and my mom would still
be around.

404
00:24:31,494 --> 00:24:33,294
Claire, I'm...

405
00:24:33,296 --> 00:24:34,829
Don't.

406
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,900
That won't hurt me.

407
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,137
Fine.

408
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:45,439
Whoa! Hey, come on.
Hold on a second.

409
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:47,208
Why?

410
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,676
Like you don't have it coming?

411
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:53,013
You stood there
while this monster took my dad.

412
00:25:01,223 --> 00:25:05,192
I used to pray to you,
Castiel.

413
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:06,560
Every night.

414
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:09,630
I would beg you
to bring him home safe.

415
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:12,967
I know.

416
00:25:15,437 --> 00:25:18,439
You know...

417
00:25:19,842 --> 00:25:21,775
My father was a good man.

418
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:23,143
In what messed up world

419
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:24,778
does he have to die
and you get to live?

420
00:25:26,081 --> 00:25:27,548
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,484
No. You feel guilty.

422
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:32,152
There's a difference.

423
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:35,623
So what,
now you run back to Randy,

424
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:37,558
the guy you steal for?

425
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:41,629
How do you know about that?
Dustin.

426
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:43,998
Claire.

427
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,834
That man is using you.

428
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,169
He was there for me.

429
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:52,039
When things got bad --
and they got real damn bad --

430
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,808
he was there
when no one else was.

431
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,846
He's my family,

432
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,181
and you're just...

433
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:05,486
You can go to hell.

434
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:26,440
Boss will see you now.

435
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:37,618
Mother.

436
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,320
Fergus.

437
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:41,555
Crowley.

438
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:43,524
Fergus.

439
00:26:49,264 --> 00:26:51,231
So you haven't changed.

440
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:55,436
But you certainly have.

441
00:26:55,438 --> 00:26:57,671
King of Hell. Bravo.

442
00:26:57,673 --> 00:26:59,740
I always knew my boy
was meant for big things.

443
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:01,408
Really?

444
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,945
As I remember it, you said
I would die in a gutter,

445
00:27:04,947 --> 00:27:07,047
covered in my own sick.

446
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:11,585
I was motivating you
to do better. Aim higher.

447
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:14,888
And clearly, it worked.

448
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:19,660
How did you die?

449
00:27:21,563 --> 00:27:23,797
The point is,

450
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,699
you hated me.

451
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:27,201
Oh, please.

452
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:29,103
You said you'd be back
in a flash,

453
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,437
and then you disappeared!

454
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:32,339
I was 8 years old!

455
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:34,308
8!
Oh, now you're being dramatic.

456
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,577
I didn't even have a father!
Of course you had a father.

457
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:39,947
You were just conceived
during a winter solstice orgy.

458
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,884
And it's not like
I was taking names.

459
00:27:45,221 --> 00:27:47,254
What do you want me
to say? I...

460
00:27:47,256 --> 00:27:49,356
I had a...disagreement
with the locals.

461
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:53,527
And when they set their hounds
on me, I had to leave.

462
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:57,798
And never come back?
For hundreds of years?

463
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,733
But I'm here now.

464
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:03,270
We have a second chance.

465
00:28:03,272 --> 00:28:06,473
We can be a real family again,
Fergus.

466
00:28:07,976 --> 00:28:09,743
Crowley.

467
00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:11,311
And I <i>have</i> a family.

468
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:14,248
Who? The demons?

469
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,183
Any one of them would
stab you in the back

470
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:18,685
if they thought they could
get away with it.

471
00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:20,721
And you wouldn't?

472
00:28:20,723 --> 00:28:23,657
No! Because we're family!
We're blood!

473
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:25,559
You can trust me,

474
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:28,028
and I can help you.

475
00:28:30,698 --> 00:28:34,134
I understand you're angry.

476
00:28:34,136 --> 00:28:37,037
I understand that you...

477
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,506
hate me.

478
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:42,810
And if you want to keep me
locked away,

479
00:28:42,812 --> 00:28:45,712
then so be it.

480
00:28:45,714 --> 00:28:51,718
But know that I'll always
be your mother.

481
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,021
And I'll always love you.

482
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:10,370
Give me a shot of, um...

483
00:29:10,372 --> 00:29:12,172
Three whiskeys.

484
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:17,311
Cass, don't beat yourself up,
man.

485
00:29:17,313 --> 00:29:18,579
Claire was...

486
00:29:18,581 --> 00:29:19,980
Right.

487
00:29:19,982 --> 00:29:21,748
She was right.

488
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,017
Who am I to tell her
how to live her life?

489
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:26,019
Well, somebody needs to.

490
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:27,454
It's not like we're talking
about Mother Teresa here.

491
00:29:27,456 --> 00:29:30,023
The girl just about knocked over
a Gas 'n Sip.

492
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:32,659
She's got issues.
Because of me.

493
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:35,295
Well, you are wearing
her old man's meatsuit.

494
00:29:35,297 --> 00:29:36,730
Probably didn't help.

495
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:42,503
I thought I could
make it up to her.

496
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:45,038
I don't think you can.

497
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:50,177
I mean, Jimmy was her father.
And to some people, that's...

498
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:52,946
that's everything, you know?

499
00:29:52,948 --> 00:29:56,283
No. I don't.
I never knew my father.

500
00:29:56,285 --> 00:29:59,353
He was distant,
to say the least.

501
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:04,892
What about you?
Did you love your father?

502
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:10,998
With everything I had.

503
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,333
Yeah.

504
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:16,370
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't
always easy, but yeah.

505
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:18,539
I mean, look,
John Winchester's not gonna win

506
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:22,075
any "Number one dad" awards,
you know? But...

507
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:24,278
You know, damn if he wasn't
there when we needed him.

508
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,346
Hey, uh...

509
00:30:26,348 --> 00:30:28,982
Tell him about
that time in New York.

510
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:31,585
Oh, yeah.

511
00:30:31,587 --> 00:30:34,988
Yeah, okay. So, um...

512
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,391
We were working this haunting
in Long Island,

513
00:30:37,393 --> 00:30:39,660
and -- and me and Sam
begged the old man

514
00:30:39,662 --> 00:30:41,828
to let us go to the city
for once.

515
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,230
He had this thing
about New York, right?

516
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:44,698
Too big, too loud, too dirty.

517
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,768
Yeah, and he hated the Yankees.
Big-time. Yeah.

518
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,369
Somehow, we convinced him
to let us go.

519
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:53,073
So we all go. We all, you know,
see all the sights,

520
00:30:53,075 --> 00:30:55,008
and, uh, ride the subway,
eat too much pizza,

521
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,510
the whole nine.

522
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,579
Well, by about midnight,
Sam and dad are zonked,

523
00:30:58,581 --> 00:31:01,248
and I figure, screw it.

524
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,716
I'm going to CBGB.

525
00:31:02,718 --> 00:31:04,318
So CBGB is --

526
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
I know.

527
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,922
It's where the Ramones
and Blondie got their start.

528
00:31:10,124 --> 00:31:11,625
Right.

529
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:13,026
Well, anyways,

530
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:15,195
he was <i>way</i> underage
at the time.

531
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:17,164
Yeah, so I get there.

532
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,701
I sneak in,
and it is <i>nuts.</i>

533
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:22,603
I mean, people are drinking
and they're smoking

534
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:24,805
and they're --
they're snortin' whatever.

535
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:27,741
There's a 500-pound guy on stage
with a Mohawk just screamin'.

536
00:31:27,743 --> 00:31:30,744
And, uh, my mind is blown.
I don't even know what to do.

537
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:32,212
Then this girl walks up
and she says,

538
00:31:32,214 --> 00:31:33,480
"Hey, why don't you come over

539
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:34,781
and sit down with my friends
at our table?"

540
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:36,283
All right.

541
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:37,751
Yeah, and they get him drunk.
First time.

542
00:31:37,753 --> 00:31:39,286
But not fun drunk.

543
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:40,821
I'm not quite sure
what was in that stuff.

544
00:31:40,823 --> 00:31:43,156
But the room starts to spin.

545
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:47,294
And I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Forever.

546
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:49,329
And right about that time,

547
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:51,865
I hear him.

548
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,467
"Dean Winchester!"

549
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:57,137
My old man.

550
00:31:57,139 --> 00:31:59,673
I don't know how,
but he found me.

551
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:01,375
And now
I'm really freaking out,

552
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,877
'cause he's just standing there,
not saying anything.

553
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:05,712
I look around. Everybody else is
freaking out, too.

554
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:07,047
In fact, nobody's even
looking him in the eye.

555
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:08,849
And finally,
this one guy with, like,

556
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:11,151
a safety pin through his nose
and a-a "kill everything" tattoo

557
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:14,688
looks up, and he says,
"Sorry, sir."

558
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:19,793
Yeah. Sorry, sir.

559
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:24,598
To John friggin' Winchester.

560
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:32,139
He saved you.

561
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:35,108
Yeah. And you know what
he got for that?

562
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,344
Me whining about
how much he embarrassed me.

563
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:40,547
Me telling him
that I hate him.

564
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,417
But then he stopped,
he turned around

565
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,951
and he looked at me
and he said,

566
00:32:44,953 --> 00:32:48,355
"Son, you don't like me?
That's fine.

567
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:50,390
It's not my job
to be liked."

568
00:32:50,392 --> 00:32:53,827
"It's my job
to raise you right."

569
00:32:56,364 --> 00:33:00,233
Yeah. And he did.

570
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:08,308
You think Claire is in trouble?

571
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,545
She's hanging out with
a guy named Randy.

572
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:16,316
- She's in trouble.
- Coming right up.

573
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:22,055
Randy.

574
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:24,524
Hey.

575
00:33:25,893 --> 00:33:27,194
Evenin', little lady.

576
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:29,429
Honey?

577
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:32,232
You have something
for me?

578
00:33:39,907 --> 00:33:42,542
No! Ow!

579
00:33:43,778 --> 00:33:46,279
Guns blazing, huh?

580
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:47,781
That was your plan?

581
00:33:48,116 --> 00:33:50,016
Trust me.

582
00:33:50,018 --> 00:33:53,353
This pile of crap?
He ain't worth it.

583
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:04,164
Put her in the other room.

584
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:10,904
She's got fight. I like that.

585
00:34:12,273 --> 00:34:15,075
I married the last girl
that spit in my face.

586
00:34:17,245 --> 00:34:19,780
Last few months,

587
00:34:19,782 --> 00:34:21,982
you've lost a bundle
on the ponies.

588
00:34:21,984 --> 00:34:24,384
How much you owe me now?

589
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:27,387
$5,000.

590
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:30,924
So how about
I give you a break?

591
00:34:30,926 --> 00:34:34,694
And <i>you</i> give me the girl.

592
00:34:37,665 --> 00:34:39,666
That's a joke, right?

593
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:41,401
Claire's like family to me.

594
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:44,371
Please.
I know the con, all right?

595
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,106
You find some kid
with major league daddy issues,

596
00:34:46,108 --> 00:34:48,008
and then you get her
to steal for you.

597
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,543
Cut the proud papa act.

598
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,511
I'll make you a good deal.

599
00:34:58,453 --> 00:35:00,454
Like I said,

600
00:35:00,456 --> 00:35:02,322
Claire's family.

601
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:07,327
So it better be
a damn good deal.

602
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:20,304
Come on.

603
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:24,809
Aah!

604
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:26,477
Come on!

605
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:32,983
Stop!

606
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:37,321
I know who's been
smuggling souls up from Hell.

607
00:35:37,323 --> 00:35:40,624
Really? Pray do tell.

608
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,993
Him.

609
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:44,428
What?

610
00:35:45,964 --> 00:35:47,431
It -- it's true, mister...

611
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:48,866
Uh, my lord.

612
00:35:48,868 --> 00:35:51,635
Gerald, he...
We made a deal.

613
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:54,638
She's lying.

614
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,307
Why? Why would she lie?

615
00:36:02,181 --> 00:36:04,849
That's enough of that, Gerald.

616
00:36:06,385 --> 00:36:08,252
I'll kill you, bitch!

617
00:36:08,254 --> 00:36:10,387
That's <i>enough,</i> Gerald.

618
00:36:19,298 --> 00:36:22,266
I said
that's enough, Gerald.

619
00:36:22,634 --> 00:36:24,969
Thank you.

620
00:36:31,877 --> 00:36:33,844
Coming?

621
00:36:44,256 --> 00:36:48,058
You said that if I lied,
you'd get me out of here.

622
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:51,162
Oh, and I will, darling.

623
00:36:51,164 --> 00:36:53,030
I'll be back in a flash.

624
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:19,190
Hi.

625
00:37:32,604 --> 00:37:35,005
It's Claire, right?

626
00:37:50,488 --> 00:37:53,290
You really are a pretty one,
you know that?

627
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:54,992
Uhh!

628
00:37:54,994 --> 00:37:57,361
Aah!

629
00:38:05,537 --> 00:38:07,104
Don't.

630
00:38:07,106 --> 00:38:08,639
Back it up.

631
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:11,375
Where's the girl?

632
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:16,413
Aah! No! No!

633
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:24,622
Uhh!

634
00:38:24,624 --> 00:38:25,923
Claire.

635
00:38:30,229 --> 00:38:32,529
Claire. Claire!

636
00:38:43,575 --> 00:38:45,476
Randy.

637
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:48,646
Get her outta here.

638
00:38:48,648 --> 00:38:51,415
Yeah. Go.

639
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:53,417
Go.

640
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:56,287
Hey, back up!

641
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:57,921
Back up!

642
00:38:57,923 --> 00:38:59,490
Don't be as dumb
as you look.

643
00:38:59,492 --> 00:39:01,292
Hey!

644
00:39:18,243 --> 00:39:21,445
You guys don't wanna do this.

645
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:28,686
Uhh!

646
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:43,166
Are you okay?

647
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:46,302
Yeah.

648
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:26,008
Dean?

649
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,211
Dean. Hey.

650
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:32,381
Tell me you had to do this.

651
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:34,450
I-I didn't --

652
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:36,118
I didn't mean to.
No.

653
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,121
Tell me it was them or you!

654
