00:09:58,138 --> 00:09:59,672
Now, we also
have some questions.

179
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:01,408
Um, for starters,
she has no memory of it.

180
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,506
The last thing she remembers
is being here.

181
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:05,180
Frank had gone
to confession.

182
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:07,518
So, if he happened to say
anything in the confession

183
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,850
about, you know,
maybe problems with the wife...

184
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:14,184
I'm sorry. The nature of
confession is confidential.

185
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:15,083
Ah. [ Sighs ]

186
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:17,719
Father, all of the victims
attended your church.

187
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,587
Um, could you
at least tell us

188
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,619
if they had recently
been to confession?

189
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,691
Yes.

190
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:24,259
These men
were fairly regular,

191
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,754
but then, so are
the majority of the folks here.

192
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:28,395
Father?
Agents,

193
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:31,629
sister Mathias is
our director of social services.

194
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,733
I've asked her to show you
around and answer any questions.

195
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,006
Sure.

196
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:38,111
Dean: Sister.

197
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:39,879
Agent...?

198
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,910
Allman.

199
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:44,150
And this is
Agent Betts.

200
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:47,951
Sister, you're aware of the
recent string of deaths, right?

201
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:50,686
Yes, a terrible tragedy.

202
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:54,554
But I'm confused
as to why you're here.

203
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:57,657
These were all suicides,
weren't they?

204
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,592
Well, possibly not.

205
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:01,728
Murders?

206
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,697
Well, the actual method
of killing was all identical.

207
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:06,959
Ah, the M.O.

208
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:10,700
Yes, indeed. The M.O.
[ Chuckles ]

209
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:14,906
I'm gonna go, uh [Clears throat]
have a look around.

210
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,945
Uh, excuse me, sister.

211
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:18,408
Agent Betts,
uh, Allman.

212
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,711
[ Clears throat ]
Okay.

213
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:25,614
Dean: Uh, sister, d-did you
notice, um, any change in the --

214
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:26,950
in the McCarthys' lives?

215
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,651
You know, fighting,
drinking, cheating?

216
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:29,746
You know, the usual.

217
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:32,981
The usual.
A bit cynical, Agent?

218
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,378
Well, you know,
scissors to the gut

219
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,042
really, uh,
bring out the Grinch in me.

220
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:38,082
[ Chuckles ]
So...

221
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:39,514
Oh...

222
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:43,922
Now, Lisa McCarthy

223
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:47,122
said that they were
very devoted to each other.

224
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,426
Was that true?

225
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:50,425
That always
appeared to be the case.

226
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:52,057
But...?

227
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:55,232
We're looking
for a motive, aren't we?

228
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:57,464
We are.

229
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,369
An earlier victim's cellphone
showed some angry texts

230
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,801
between he
and his girlfriend

231
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:04,442
'cause he
had been fooling around.

232
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:05,808
There were rumors.

233
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,205
So, Frank cheated on Lisa.
So, she lied to me.

234
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:11,941
Oh, she didn't know.

235
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:14,012
My sources
are excellent.

236
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:17,011
And you didn't
hear it from me.

[ Warbling ]

239
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,583
I got a question.

240
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:30,653
How does
someone, uh, like you

241
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:33,190
end up, you know...?

242
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:36,360
Cloistered away from the world?

00:12:36,362 --> 00:12:38,663
Are you making fun of me,
Agent Allman?

244
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:41,565
No. No, no.
I, uh...

245
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:44,562
I guess I'm just wondering
how somebody quits one life

246
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:47,098
for something
completely different

247
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,338
and -- and then
believe in it so much.

248
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,843
Well [Sighs]

249
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:57,484
In my case,
I felt I had no choice.

250
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:02,159
My life
had become painful.

251
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:04,392
There was hopelessness.

252
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:07,266
I felt I had to find

253
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:12,404
something larger
than myself to focus on.

254
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:16,478
A kind of mission,
I guess.

255
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:22,519
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, I'm sure.

Mm, don't be.

I got a question.

258
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,489
I'm sure it's
a different question.

259
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:34,689
Is there
a cemetery nearby?

260
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,120
You could say that.

261
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:37,992
The entire church is built
over burial crypts.

262
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:39,496
Oh.

263
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:42,662
Have you ever, uh,
heard or -- or felt

264
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:44,398
anything strange
or unusual?

265
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,732
Unusual how?

266
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:49,035
Like, uh, spots in the building
that suddenly get cold

267
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,367
or, uh -- or maybe you
feel like you're not --

268
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:52,997
not quite alone?

269
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,869

that fly across the room?

making fun of<i> me?</i>

271

believes in ghosts?

I have to get back to work.

Mm.

276
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,449
Tell me you didn't
think that nun was hot.

277
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:21,553
[ Chuckles ] I think she had
a little thing for me, too.

278
00:14:21,555 --> 00:14:25,359
Dean, she was
married to Jesus.

279
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:26,695
All right, so,

280
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:29,094
Frank cheated on his wife, Lisa,
all right?

281
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:31,660
You know,
the whole theme of this case

282
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,060
seems to be about guys
doing their women wrong.

283
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:35,468
Notice that?

284
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,868
Yeah, but Lisa McCarthy
was pretty convincing

285
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,069
that she had no idea whatsoever
she had killed her husband.

286
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:42,540
Oh, hot nun said that Lisa had
no idea he was cheating on her.

287
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:45,738
So, maybe she was controlled
by someone who did.

288
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,475
Again, nothing witchy.

289
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:49,412
Ghost?
Hard to say.

290
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:52,013
I mean, there's EMF in the church,
but it's built on a burial ground.

291
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:54,318
You know that all the victims recently
went to confession?

292
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,088
So you think
Father Delaney's involved?

293
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,970
Or maybe something surrounding
the confessional.

294
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:02,762
Sammy, how long has it been
since my last confession?

295
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:04,835
You've never
been to confession.

Well, that's too long.

It's what
I can do for<i> you.</i>

00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:27,922

just how wretched it would be

you must feel, and I sympathize.

your time as outcast

When we initiated your

grew out of control.

between madness and devotion.

00:38:42,835 --> 00:38:44,433
You see?

706
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:45,872
We're not
so very different.

707
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:48,472
What is it
that you want?

708
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:51,807
[ Sighs ]
Well, Fergus, since you asked,

709
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:56,309
these friends of yours --
the Winchesters --

710
00:38:56,311 --> 00:38:59,514
I hear they are,
oh, what do you call it, um,

711
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:01,111
Men of Letters?

712
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:02,477
Possibly.

713
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:04,508
I see.
Well, about that --

714
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,411
Listen, we've
been through this.

715
00:39:06,413 --> 00:39:09,317
My relationship with
the Winchesters is my business.

716
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:11,884
I'll handle them.
I'm not killing them.

717
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:14,452
All right, deary.

718
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:15,853
Of course.

719
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:18,460
Whatever you say.

720
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:37,270
Dean: Who mixes their blood
and bones into paint?

721
00:39:37,272 --> 00:39:39,469
No woman's
ever done<i> that</i> for me.

722
00:39:39,471 --> 00:39:40,509
[ Chuckles ]

723
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,572
Sam:
Is this you thanking me

724
00:39:42,574 --> 00:39:45,347
for not doing
what you told me to do?

725
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,947
You know, if you
would have burned the journal,

726
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:49,778
then we wouldn't know
how to kill it, would we?

727
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,650
[ Chuckles ]

728
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:53,418
Yeah, you're welcome.

729
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,954
[ Chuckles ]

730
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:56,786
[ Chuckles ]

731
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:02,194
You know...

732
00:40:02,196 --> 00:40:05,095
You were in that confessional
a long time.

733
00:40:11,098 --> 00:40:13,934
Look, man,
I'm just saying,

734
00:40:13,936 --> 00:40:15,668
I'm your brother, Dean.

735
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,404
If you ever need to talk
about anything with anybody,

736
00:40:18,406 --> 00:40:22,004
you got somebody
right here next to you.

737
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:27,243
Okay.

738
00:40:27,245 --> 00:40:30,174
I heard what sister Mathias
was saying about, you know,

739
00:40:30,176 --> 00:40:34,073
hiding pain
by taking on a mission,

740
00:40:34,075 --> 00:40:36,838
and I-I know that's
what you're doing a little bit.

741
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,405
And it's okay.

742
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:41,045
I mean, it's fine. I get it.
I've done it before, too.

743
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:43,780
But...

744
00:40:43,782 --> 00:40:45,444
I don't buy
for one second

745
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:49,116
that the Mark
is a terminal diagnosis,

746
00:40:49,118 --> 00:40:53,154
so don't go
making peace with that idea.

747
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:54,456
There has to be
a way.

748
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:57,519
There will be a way,
and we will find it.

749
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,792
That's what we do.

750
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:01,528
So, believe that.

751
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:05,464
Okay, Sammy.

752
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:09,734
You want to...

753
00:41:09,736 --> 00:41:12,536
Uh, try that again
like you mean it?

754
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,175
Okay.
