1
00:00:02,645 --> 00:00:03,944
Where is Crowley?

2
00:00:03,946 --> 00:00:04,979
I don't know!

3
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:06,313
Where's my brother?!

4
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:07,648
Cass, I think
I might've found something.

5
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:10,467
Actually, you need
to be worrying about yourself.

6
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,702
I'm fine.

7
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:12,653
You're dying.

8
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:14,104
You need more Grace.

9
00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:15,839
And Metatron?
Still in jail.

10
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:17,658
You're a good soldier,
Hannah.

11
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,561
Your brother
is very much alive,

12
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:21,495
courtesy of the Mark.

13
00:00:21,497 --> 00:00:22,997
The Mark
needs to be sated.

14
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:25,332
Otherwise,
I turn into a demon.

15
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:27,918
You can't stand
that he's my best friend.

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,921
Together, we create
the perfect hell.

17
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:32,806
I am going to find you.

18
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:35,092
I am going to save
my brother.

19
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:36,677
Need some help?

20
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:41,765
I wouldn't do that.
He's a monster.

21
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:43,317
Is he dead?

22
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:44,852
As long as you show up
where I tell you to show up,

23
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:46,520
your brother will be
just fine.

24
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:48,355
I told him to let me go.

25
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:50,574
So whatever jam he's in now,
that is his problem.

26
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:02,536
No, please! Please!

27
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:04,588
Please don't!

28
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:32,149
Dad?

29
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:38,172
Dad.

30
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:40,324
Dad?!

31
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:44,328
Daddy.

32
00:01:58,427 --> 00:02:00,260
And that was the night

33
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:02,980
that Dean Winchester
murdered my father.

34
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:05,099
And that's...

35
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:07,768
that's why
he's gonna die.

36
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:12,439
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:17,945
I'm not looking
for your sympathy, Sammy.

38
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:19,780
I'm looking
for your brother.

39
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:22,249
So, why don't you tell me
where Dean-o is,

40
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:23,951
and then
I'll let you go.

41
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:26,036
That's not gonna happen.

42
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:27,621
Really?

43
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:29,456
Now, you know your brother
gave me the, uh, green light

44
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,091
to put one
between your eyes, right?

45
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:34,795
Dean...

46
00:02:34,797 --> 00:02:37,464
Dean isn't Dean
right now.

47
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:39,133
Now, look,
I don't know who you are --

48
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:40,801
Name's Cole.

49
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:46,690
Listen, Sam...

50
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,779
Every night...
since I was 13 years old...

51
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,649
Every night,
I close my eyes...

52
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:59,486
...and all I can see
is your brother...

53
00:02:59,488 --> 00:03:02,739
and all that blood...

54
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,742
and my daddy.

55
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:09,112
Now...

56
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:12,916
I know
Dean's family and all,

57
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:14,701
but he gave you up.

58
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:17,671
And you have no reason
to protect him -- none.

59
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:20,457
So help me.

60
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:21,925
Please.

61
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:27,014
Look,
I'm sorry about your dad.

62
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:31,051
Whatever happened...

63
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:33,053
Dean had a reason.

64
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:36,190
I don't know
how to tell you this.

65
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:37,774
There are monsters
out there.

66
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:41,445
You don't think
I know that?

67
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:46,567
I did two tours in Iraq.

68
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:48,735
Special Ops, Darfur...

69
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:50,320
The Congo.

70
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:52,573
I've seen suicide bombers
and child soldiers

71
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:55,459
so hopped up on speed
that they could barely talk!

72
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:57,461
Oh, but they could
sure as hell shoot an A.K.

73
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:58,996
Not that kind
of monster.

74
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:00,464
don't tell me
about monsters!

75
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:02,216
'Cause I've met my share.

76
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:03,750
I mean vampires!

77
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:06,253
All right?
Werewolves.

78
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:09,506
<i>Monster</i> monsters.

79
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:13,143
Look in the bag.

80
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:15,262
Go on.

81
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:17,898
Take a look.
It's right there.

82
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:24,154
I guess even psychos
need to hydrate.

83
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:26,240
It's holy water.

84
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:28,025
Holy cow.

85
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:31,278
Look,
I'm not a psycho.

86
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,946
And I'm not lying.

87
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:35,999
Well, you see, that's exactly
what a psycho liar would say,

88
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,951
so...

89
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:39,620
See my dilemma?

90
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:42,873
I guess...

91
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,959
We are just
gonna have to do this

92
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:47,661
the other way.

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,150
? cool drink of water,
such a sweet surprise ?

97
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:13,203
? tastes so good,
make a grown man cry ?

98
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:15,489
? sweet cherry pie ?

99
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,541
? yeah ?

100
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:19,159
? whoa! ?

101
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:22,379
No touching.

102
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:24,131
? Well,
swinging on the front porch ?

103
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:25,666
House rules.

104
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,167
? Swinging on the lawn ?

105
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,552
? swinging where we want ?
you sure about that?

106
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:30,337
? 'Cause there ain't
nobody home ?

107
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,306
? swinging to the left
and swinging to the right ?

108
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:35,309
? think about baseball,
swing all night ?

109
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:37,010
? yeah ?

110
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:39,730
? yeah, yeah ?
Go ahead. Pick it up.

111
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:42,349
And we're done.

112
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:45,152
Hey, hey, hey.
Song's not over, sweetheart.

113
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:46,720
Time to go, jerkwad.

114
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,689
? 'Cause she wanted me
to feed her ?

115
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:52,576
Where's Dean, Sam?

116
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:55,579
Where is he?

117
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:59,666
? she's my cherry pie ?

118
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:01,835
Where is he?!

119
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,006
? She's my cherry pie ?

120
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:08,458
? put a smile on your face
10 miles wide ?

121
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,511
? looks so good,
bring a tear to your eye ?

122
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:14,097
? sweet cherry pie ?

123
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:19,353
? sweet cherry pi-I-I-I-I-I-e ?

124
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:20,937
? yeah ?

125
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,139
? sweet ?

126
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:34,234
Shove it up your ass.

127
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:38,038
Okay. Okay.

128
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,573
Okay, okay.

129
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,575
I guess it's time
to crank up the volume, then.

130
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,627
Huh?

131
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:50,917
Right there.

132
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:02,145
Ain't you lucky, boy?

133
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:07,401
Hey, darling.

134
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:10,070
No, I'm good.

135
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:13,790
No, everything's fine.
Everything's just fine.

136
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,859
Go ahead. Put him on.

137
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,781
Hey. Hey, big guy.
How you doing?

138
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:28,288
Now, no, no. Listen, daddy's
really busy right now, okay?

139
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,123
I love you.

140
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:34,177
All right, I got to go, okay?
I'm gonna have to call you back.

141
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:46,540
Move, grandpa.

142
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:52,028
Kids. Am I right?

143
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,364
In my day,
we respected our elders.

144
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:57,317
Of course, back then,
anyone over 30 was ancient.

145
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,786
Now 40-year-olds
are still living with mommy,

146
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:01,955
lying on OkCupid, and taking
pictures of their food.

147
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:03,790
What do you want,
Crowley?

148
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,625
A chat.

149
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:10,330
We need to talk about your...
Anger-management issues.

150
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:38,942
Here.

151
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:40,744
Let me.

152
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,755
Thank you.

153
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,926
Hannah,
you don't have to --

154
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:58,512
you -- you can go.

155
00:08:58,514 --> 00:08:59,980
You don't owe me
anything.

156
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:01,848
I know.

157
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,251
But I want to stay...

158
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:07,687
and help.

159
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:09,055
Is that wrong?

160
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:10,057
No.

161
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:12,475
It's just...very human.

162
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:15,562
It's a compliment.

163
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:17,614
Oh.

164
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,736
Sam.

165
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:24,905
You need to get to Beulah,
North Dakota -- now.

166
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:26,957
I do?
Yes. Crowley and Dean were there.

167
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,158
We got to
pick up their trail.

168
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,627
Good. Great.

169
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:33,830
Yeah, um...not so much.

170
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:35,465
Cass...

171
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:37,300
Dean's a demon.

172
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:41,671
Dean's a demon?

173
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:42,806
How?

174
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:46,059
The Mark --
I-I guess it --

175
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:48,645
it just messed him up.
I don't know.

176
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:51,097
That is
a vast understatement.

177
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,099
Right.
Now, Cass, listen.

178
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:54,901
I know you're not feeling
so hot, but this is kind of

179
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:57,187
an “all hands on deck” situation
here, so...

180
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,039
So...
I'll meet you there.

181
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,941
Yeah.

182
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,708
Are you sure about this?

183
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,677
If you wanted
to stay behind...

184
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,295
I didn't.
I just...

185
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:27,350
Castiel...

186
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:29,719
I think the Winchesters
are a bad influence on you.

187
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:33,556
Sam and Dean may be
a bit rough around the edges,

188
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:36,610
but they're the best men
I've ever known.

189
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:38,895
And they're my friends.

190
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:49,122
I never get tired
of looking at them.

191
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:52,292
All those stars.

192
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:16,788
Two shots here.

193
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,092
He'll have something fancy,
with your tiniest umbrella.

194
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:24,212
So...

195
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:25,847
How you been feeling?

196
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:27,516
On edge?

197
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:28,684
Pent-up?

198
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:30,185
Unfulfilled?

199
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:32,104
You sound like
a Viagra commercial.

200
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:33,138
You know that, right?

201
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,391
This isn't about...
Little Dean.

202
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:39,227
It's about the Mark.
It changed you.

203
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:40,612
I've noticed.

204
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:42,981
And I know that you want
to keep the party going.

205
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:44,316
You want to have
fun, fun, fun

206
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:47,869
till daddy
takes the black eyes away.

207
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:49,821
The fact is...

208
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:51,823
you need to kill now.

209
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:55,043
Not want to,
not choose to --

210
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:57,212
<i>need</i> to.

211
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:58,463
There you go.

212
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,754
<i>Danke.</i>

213
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:08,507
Face it, darling.

214
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:11,510
You're an addict.
Death is your drug.

215
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:14,062
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life

216
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:15,313
chasing that dragon.

217
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:18,233
So?

218
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:22,070
So...I'm here
to facilitate.

219
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:24,890
You want me to kill
for you.

220
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:27,025
I want you to kill
for<i> us.</i>

221
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:28,860
Look...

222
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:31,079
You're going to snap
eventually.

223
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:34,866
The anger, the bloodlust
is gonna build up in you

224
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:37,119
until you can't take it
anymore,

225
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,870
and then...

226
00:12:38,872 --> 00:12:41,456
So, the question is,

227
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,426
do you want to
spike a civilian

228
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:47,262
or someone
who has it coming?

229
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:50,182
Like who?

230
00:12:51,385 --> 00:12:54,286
Like...

231
00:12:54,288 --> 00:12:57,055
Mindy Morris.

232
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:58,440
Caring mother...

233
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,776
Loving wife...

234
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,896
...Cheating trollop.

235
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:06,364
After her husband,
Lester,

236
00:13:06,366 --> 00:13:09,701
discovered Mindy's
<i>liaison amoureuse,</i>

237
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:11,570
heated words
were exchanged.

238
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:14,456
In the end,
Mindy wanted a divorce...

239
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,075
And 50% of everything.

240
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:18,293
But Lester --

241
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:21,379
Lester would rather
give up his soul

242
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,048
than half his junk.

243
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,052
We live in
a very materialistic world.

244
00:13:27,054 --> 00:13:30,055
Mindy's gonna die
one way or the other.

245
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:34,092
Why not take the job --
feed the beast?

246
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:40,432
Fine.

247
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:44,986
One-time deal.

248
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:46,988
Oh,
there's something else

249
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,608
that I...
need to share with you.

250
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,836
I'm gonna have to run in to town
for a new set of tires.

251
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:02,454
Could take a while.

252
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:04,289
You want to head inside
and watch TV or something,

253
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,842
you're more than welcome.

254
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:09,377
Oh, and there's
leftover three-bean surprise

255
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:10,879
in the fridge,
if you're hungry.

256
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,464
You're very kind.

257
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:16,852
Well, makes up for me
being an ax murderer and all.

258
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:22,190
Uh, sorry. Kidding.

259
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:25,477
Ah, I see.

260
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:32,534
Thank you
for everything.

261
00:14:57,511 --> 00:15:01,763
I understand
the three beans, but...

262
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:03,932
What's the surprise?

263
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:15,170
Hey!

264
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:16,338
Hey!

265
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,506
Let me guess -- Lester?

266
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:21,142
I...Who are you?

267
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:23,979
Who do you think?

268
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:28,099
Whoa.

269
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:30,018
Ohh!
“Ohh.”

270
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,020
What the hell
are you doing here, man?

271
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:34,439
Well, my contact...

272
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:37,776
Yeah, he, uh -- he told me that,
uh, this was happening,

273
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:40,028
so I just
wanted to come down

274
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,997
and make sure
it gets done right.

275
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:45,000
Ah. 'Cause
you're the expert, huh?

276
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:50,038
Listen --
and this is murder 101 --

277
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,924
when you hire someone
to kill your wife,

278
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:54,960
you don't want to be around
when the hit goes down.

279
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:56,761
It's called an alibi.

280
00:16:56,763 --> 00:16:59,297
Yeah, I know
what an alibi is.

281
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:01,299
I watch
“Franklin & Bash”.

282
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:05,470
Super.

283
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:07,522
Listen, you sold your soul
for this crap, so --

284
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:10,692
It's not crap.

285
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:12,811
It's my life.

286
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:17,198
And she
flushed it down the toilet.

287
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,985
Les...

288
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:21,369
I'm gonna say something
to you.

289
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:23,204
I need you
to really listen to me.

290
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:24,572
You're a loser.

291
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:26,574
Your lady in there --
she's a North Dakota 8.

292
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:27,909
You're a 4 1/2, Max.

293
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:29,878
Now, I don't blame her
for stepping out --

294
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,664
especially if she found
you were messing around first.

295
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,916
No. Oh, no.

296
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:37,786
I-I wasn't...Uh --

297
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:42,090
How do you know?

298
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:45,510
Well, you just got that,
uh, pervy,

299
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:47,762
“I'd do anything
to nail my secretary” look.

300
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:49,564
Oh. No.

301
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:52,067
T-that -- it's different
when guys do it.

302
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:53,018
Really?

303
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,770
Yeah.
It's called “science”.

304
00:17:55,772 --> 00:17:56,988
Oh.

305
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,858
Men aren't built
for monogamy...

306
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,359
because of evolution.

307
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:03,361
We're -- we're --
we're programmed, you know,

308
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:05,113
to --
to spread our seed.

309
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:06,247
Ugh!

310
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,700
Ohh! Ow!

311
00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:10,919
Like I said --
loser, with a capital “L,”

312
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:12,754
rhymes with “you suck.”

313
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:16,591
Yeah, well,
you're a punk-ass demon!

314
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:18,543
And you work for<i> me</i> now.

315
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:21,429
So get in there
and do your job, you freak!

316
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:27,519
And what are you gonna do?
You gonna watch, huh?

317
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:31,139
Is that what you like to do,
Lester? Watch?

318
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:36,361
Well, watch<i> this.</i>

319
00:18:47,674 --> 00:18:49,574
Hmm. That's the guy.

320
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:52,127
I called 911,

321
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:55,080
but he was gone
before they showed up.

322
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:58,133
That dude get to you,
too?

323
00:18:58,135 --> 00:18:59,300
Oh, uh, no.

324
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:02,554
This is, uh,
just a...hunting accident.

325
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:04,556
Damn.

326
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,392
Yeah.
Would you do me a favor?

327
00:19:07,394 --> 00:19:10,995
If you do see him again,
will you give me a call?

328
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:13,565
Yeah. You bet.

329
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:14,983
Thanks.

330
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:00,594
Hello.

331
00:20:00,596 --> 00:20:02,045
Hi.

332
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:03,462
Did you have
a good dream?

333
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:05,029
Well...

334
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,497
I, uh...

335
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,332
I don't really dream.

336
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,817
Why?

337
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:13,036
One time, I dreamed
that my snot was a rocket,

338
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,957
and it shot into space
and knocked down the stars

339
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:20,127
to make room
for more rockets!

340
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:24,431
That sounds like
some very special snot.

341
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,645
All right,
you're good to go.

342
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:40,363
We appreciate that.

343
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:44,734
Great guy
you have there.

344
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:47,154
Oh.

345
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:48,822
We're not...

346
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:50,290
That.

347
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,243
Too bad.

348
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:55,796
At the end of the day,

349
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:57,998
we have to strategically
calibrate expectations.

350
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,051
And so, by making
these 64 small changes...

351
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,553
...I believe we can increase

352
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:08,225
our demon-conversion rate
by 0.03%.

353
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:10,060
Uh, sir?

354
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:11,261
Sir?

355
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:12,979
Kill me.

356
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:16,266
Uh...
It's Sam Winchester, sir.

357
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:17,268
He's close.

358
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:21,688
Dean!

359
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,908
How did it go?

360
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,943
Fine. Fine.

361
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:28,361
Uh...

362
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:30,780
He's dead, and you're right --
I-I feel amazing.

363
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:32,199
“He”?

364
00:21:33,535 --> 00:21:35,952
Uh, Lester.

365
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:37,787
The client?

366
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:40,006
You killed the client?

367
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,377
Does it matter? He was a douche.
Now he's a<i> dead</i> douche.

368
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:45,712
Of course it matters!

369
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:48,098
The deal was one dead wife
for one soul.

370
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,184
The wife's not dead,
I don't get the soul.

371
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,386
It's math.

372
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:55,555
Well...There you go.

373
00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:58,608
Hey! don't turn your back
on me!

374
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,988
Is something funny?

375
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,790
No, sir.

376
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,458
Mnh.

377
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,127
Good.

378
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:24,501
What do you think
you're doing?

379
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:26,002
Oh, whatever I want.

380
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:27,554
Really?

381
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:30,657
Because I think
you don't<i> know</i> what you want.

382
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:34,127
Tell me, Dean --
what are you?

383
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:35,428
A demon?

384
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,065
If so, why isn't
Lester's wife dead?

385
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,401
Did you feel sorry
for her?

386
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:44,154
So maybe you're human.

387
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,406
Except you have
those pretty black peepers

388
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,942
and you're working
alongside<i> me.</i>

389
00:22:48,944 --> 00:22:53,029
Why don't you do us all
a great big favor

390
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:55,782
and pick a bloody side?!

391
00:22:55,784 --> 00:22:58,885
Or what?

392
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,292
Hmm?

393
00:23:05,294 --> 00:23:07,928
Go ahead.

394
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,130
Make a move.

395
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:12,382
See how it ends.

396
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,690
I ain't
your friggin' bestie,

397
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,108
and I ain't taking orders
from you.

398
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,693
When I need to kill,
I'll call.

399
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:27,197
Until then,
stay out of my way.

400
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,317
Fine.

401
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,901
It's over.

402
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:35,538
What can I say?

403
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,290
Crazy ones --

404
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,659
well, they're good
for a fling,

405
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:43,630
but they're not
relationship material.

406
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,133
Are you done?

407
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,552
<i>We're</i> done.

408
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:52,339
You know what, Dean?

409
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:55,976
It's not me.
It's<i> you.</i>

410
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:08,738
Maybe<i> I</i> should drive?

411
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,190
All right.

412
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:13,243
Good idea.

413
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:25,872
Hello, Bullwinkle.

414
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:28,958
You miss me?

415
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:32,762
So much.

416
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,181
You're here for Dean.
I'm here to give him to you.

417
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:38,184
What?

418
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:39,769
The little prat's
bad for business.

419
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,772
He's...uncontrollable.
Must be the Mark.

420
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:47,861
Anyway, Dean's<i> your</i> problem
now -- again, forever.

421
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:49,396
Then where is he?

422
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:52,532
First, there's the small matter
of my finder's fee.

423
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:21,845
Hannah?!

424
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:24,013
She's gone, Castiel.

425
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:26,516
She took the express elevator
upstairs.

426
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:30,737
To heaven? Why?

427
00:25:40,232 --> 00:25:43,216
Mm.

428
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:45,335
Hello, beautiful.

429
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,174
Metatron.

430
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:53,710
I knew you'd come back.

431
00:25:53,712 --> 00:25:57,046
That white-hot spark
between us -- I felt it.

432
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:00,934
I'm here about Castiel.

433
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:05,138
Boo.

434
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,307
After you cast the spell
to close the Gates of Heaven,

435
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:09,859
was there
any of his Grace left?

436
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:12,395
And if there was?

437
00:26:12,397 --> 00:26:14,314
Then I want it.

438
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:17,150
Well...

439
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:21,871
Everybody
wants<i> something.</i>

440
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:24,374
Question is,
are you willing to pay for it?

441
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,493
Are you willing to...

442
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:30,997
I don't know --
let me out?

443
00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:35,335
Oh, come on.
don't look so shocked.

444
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:37,220
You knew
what I'd ask for.

445
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,671
And you wouldn't have
come here

446
00:26:38,673 --> 00:26:41,007
if you weren't willing
to pony up.

447
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:44,511
It doesn't make it
any easier.

448
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:50,150
Fair enough.

449
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,152
So...

450
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:54,988
Let me sweeten the pot.

451
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,409
I have had time to...

452
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,528
think.

453
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,380
And I've decided --
screw earth.

454
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:09,035
You pop that lock,
I'll give you Castiel's Grace

455
00:27:09,037 --> 00:27:11,037
and then scamper off
to another planet --

456
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,872
another<i> galaxy,</i> even --

457
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:16,926
and you will
never see me again.

458
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:22,599
And in return...

459
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:25,385
you get Cass back
at full power --

460
00:27:25,387 --> 00:27:29,639
large and in charge.

461
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:33,309
And that's what
you really want, isn't it?

462
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:37,730
Somebody big and strong
telling you what to do.

463
00:27:37,732 --> 00:27:39,566
Poor little Hannah.

464
00:27:39,568 --> 00:27:44,454
You're so desperate
to be dominated.

465
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,408
Ow!

466
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,044
Watch your mouth.

467
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,829
Ah.

468
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:58,167
Like I said --
white-hot spark.

469
00:28:00,171 --> 00:28:02,672
So, do we have a deal?

470
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:05,058
No.

471
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,093
What are you doing?

472
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,763
Ugh.

473
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:13,766
You know perfectly well
what she's doing, ass-tiel.

474
00:28:13,768 --> 00:28:16,603
I had to.
You are dying.

475
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:18,021
She's right.
You totally are.

476
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:19,656
You shut up!

477
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:21,941
He said your Grace --
it's still out there.

478
00:28:21,943 --> 00:28:24,410
He's lying.
He is a liar.

479
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,663
Hey, words hurt!

480
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:29,332
Listen to me, Hannah.
You don't want this.

481
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,251
I have seen what --

482
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:34,954
I've<i> made</i> deals
born of desperation,

483
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:37,957
and they always end
in blood and tears --

484
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:39,292
always.

485
00:28:39,294 --> 00:28:41,377
So I'm supposed to let you...
Yes.

486
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:45,014
It's<i> my</i> life,
and it's<i> my</i> choice.

487
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:46,799
And I don't want<i> this.</i>

488
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,020
I...

489
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,859
You're right.

490
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,227
I'm sorry.

491
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:11,991
You're wrong.

492
00:29:11,993 --> 00:29:16,796
Not about the lying part.
I am a<i> terrific</i> liar.

493
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,465
But there<i> is</i>
some of your mojo left.

494
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,168
Not a lot...

495
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,754
But enough.

496
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:29,375
And it can be yours
for the low, low price of --

497
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:31,477
Keep it.

498
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,898
Seriously?

499
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:39,268
I've made peace
with my fate.

500
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:44,691
Who's the liar now?

501
00:29:46,194 --> 00:29:50,830
I enjoy thinking about
you locked up in here,

502
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,950
rotting
until the end of time.

503
00:29:53,952 --> 00:29:57,704
It's my...happy place.

504
00:29:57,706 --> 00:30:01,507
Yeah?

505
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:05,545
Uh...No.

506
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:07,296
I'll get out.

507
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,351
It may take a century.

508
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:13,936
May take
a millennium or two,

509
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:17,774
but<i> this</i> dump
will not hold me forever.

510
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:20,226
And when I'm free --

511
00:30:20,228 --> 00:30:25,281
here's a little
sneak preview --

512
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:28,151
everybody dies.

513
00:30:28,153 --> 00:30:30,119
You...

514
00:30:34,075 --> 00:30:36,876
You talk too much.

515
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:38,961
You should have killed me when
you had the chance, Castiel.

516
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:41,330
Dead man walking!

517
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:43,916
You heard me!

518
00:30:43,918 --> 00:30:46,636
Dead man walking!!

519
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:05,938
<i> What are you, Dean?</i>
<i>A demon?</i>

520
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,691
<i>Maybe you're a human.</i>

521
00:31:10,445 --> 00:31:12,578
Pick a bloody side!

522
00:31:21,873 --> 00:31:23,790
Hiya, Sam.

523
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:41,707
Hey, Harv, why don't you
go grab a smoke?

524
00:31:49,003 --> 00:31:50,819
Who winged you?

525
00:31:52,223 --> 00:31:53,255
Does it matter?

526
00:31:53,257 --> 00:31:55,607
Not really.

527
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:59,061
I told you
to let me go.

528
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:03,048
You know
I can't do that.

529
00:32:04,268 --> 00:32:10,589
By the way,
your, uh,<i> pal</i> Crowley...

530
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:12,140
Sold you out.

531
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:15,561
Sounds like him.

532
00:32:15,563 --> 00:32:17,980
Dean,
hold on a second.

533
00:32:17,982 --> 00:32:20,365
You don't
have to do this.

534
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:23,869
Look, we know how to cure
demons. You remember that?

535
00:32:23,871 --> 00:32:26,705
Little Latin,
lot of blood.

536
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:28,540
It rings a bell.

537
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:31,410
Did you ever stop to think
that if I wanted to be cured,

538
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:34,997
I wouldn't have bailed?

539
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:36,882
That was Crowley.

540
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:39,551
It really wasn't.

541
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:44,673
It doesn't matter,
all right?

542
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:48,610
'Cause whatever went down,
whatever happened,

543
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:50,512
we will fix it.

544
00:32:50,514 --> 00:32:51,847
Will we?

545
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:53,932
'Cause right now,
I'm doing all I can

546
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:56,184
not to come over there
and rip your throat out...

547
00:32:56,186 --> 00:32:58,186
with my teeth.

548
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:03,108
I'm giving you a chance, Sam.
You should take it.

549
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:07,112
I'm gonna have to pass.

550
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:12,117
Well, I'm not walking
out that door with you.

551
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:14,920
I'm just not.

552
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:17,039
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna kill me?

553
00:33:20,294 --> 00:33:21,510
No.

554
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:24,463
Why?

555
00:33:24,465 --> 00:33:26,682
You don't know
what I've done.

556
00:33:26,684 --> 00:33:29,434
I might have it coming.

557
00:33:32,856 --> 00:33:35,057
Well, I don't care.

558
00:33:36,393 --> 00:33:39,561
Because
you are my brother.

559
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:41,697
And I'm here
to take you home.

560
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,150
Hmm.

561
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,574
Ah!

562
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:56,578
“You're my brother,
and I'm here to take you home.”

563
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,380
Yeah, what is this,
a Lifetime movie?

564
00:33:58,382 --> 00:34:01,300
Huh? With your
puppy-dog eyes?

565
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:05,387
Oh, thanks, Sammy.
I needed that.

566
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:15,480
You really think
those are gonna work?

567
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:19,601
There's one way
to find out.

568
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,508
Ugh.

569
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:57,172
Wow.

570
00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:58,940
It's really you.

571
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:01,360
We met?

572
00:35:01,362 --> 00:35:03,278
Talked on the phone.

573
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,063
Right. Right.

574
00:35:05,065 --> 00:35:08,116
You're the guy who's supposed to
put a bullet in Sammy's brain.

575
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:09,818
Did you miss?

576
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,153
Well,
I had a better idea.

577
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:13,789
I figure
if I let your bro escape,

578
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:15,157
he'd go running to you,

579
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,825
and all I had to do
was just tag along.

580
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:19,828
And now here we are,
finally --

581
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,413
Dean Winchester.

582
00:35:21,415 --> 00:35:24,966
Great. A groupie.

583
00:35:24,968 --> 00:35:27,169
You remember me?

584
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:31,173
Yeah, yeah. You're that guy
from that thing.

585
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:34,576
Nyack, New York,
June 21, 2003.

586
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:36,478
That supposed to
ring a bell?

587
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,846
It was the night
you gutted and murdered a man

588
00:35:37,848 --> 00:35:39,931
by the name
of Edward Trenton.

589
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:41,733
He was my father.

590
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:43,852
Okay.

591
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:45,771
“Okay”?
Well, hey, I'm not saying

592
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:47,572
I didn't slice and dice
your old man.

593
00:35:47,574 --> 00:35:49,408
I'm just saying
that he wasn't the first,

594
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,859
and he certainly wasn't
the last,

595
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:52,527
and they all
just kind of get blended up.

596
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:55,781
I saw you...
That night...

597
00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:57,249
After.

598
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:59,267
You let me live.
That was dumb --<i> real</i> dumb.

599
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,375
I spent half my life
training for this moment.

600
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:12,214
I've played out this fight
a thousand times in my mind.

601
00:36:12,216 --> 00:36:14,549
And I know all about you,
Dean-o.

602
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:18,053
And you're good.
Oh, you're<i> real</i> good.

603
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:19,638
But, you see,
I'm better.

604
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,841
Prove it.

605
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:24,726
Take a shot.

606
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:28,613
Now,
that's not payback.

607
00:36:34,905 --> 00:36:36,788
<i>This</i> is payback.

608
00:36:53,423 --> 00:36:55,390
You know...

609
00:36:55,392 --> 00:36:58,760
And I'm just spitballing here,
but, uh, maybe...

610
00:36:58,762 --> 00:37:03,532
you are not as good
as you think you are.

611
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:05,484
Oh!

612
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:07,769
You know Kung Fu?

613
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:09,938
I know<i> everything.</i>

614
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,991
Well, come on.

615
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,126
What did you think
was gonna happen, huh?

616
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:33,378
You just stroll up here
and say

617
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,213
“my name is Inigo Montoya.

618
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:38,717
You killed my father.
Prepare to die,”

619
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,218
And I'd just roll over?

620
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:45,607
Well, that's just --
it makes me sad.

621
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,609
Ugh!

622
00:37:50,364 --> 00:37:54,616
You have no idea what
you walked into here, do you?

623
00:37:54,618 --> 00:37:56,034
None.

624
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:59,037
What are you?

625
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:01,656
I'm a demon.

626
00:38:15,973 --> 00:38:18,974
Do it!

627
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:22,427
You said if you saw me,
you would kill me, so do it!

628
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:27,933
I guess
I changed my mind.

629
00:38:37,494 --> 00:38:39,527
Stop! It's over!

630
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:40,529
It's over.

631
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:53,414
A pleasure doing business.

632
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,550
What are you
gonna do with it?

633
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:59,754
Toss it into a volcano,
leave it on the Moon.

634
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:01,389
I'll get creative.

635
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:03,842
Believe me,

636
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:06,427
I don't want Dean getting
his hands on the precious

637
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:08,480
any more than<i> you</i> do.

638
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:10,648
Your brother knows
I ratted.

639
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,567
He tends
to hold a grudge.

640
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:14,569
I don't want to get...

641
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:16,104
Boned.

642
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:22,527
This doesn't
make us square.

643
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,697
If I see you again --

644
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:29,450
Oh, stop it, Samantha.
No one likes a tease.

645
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,310
Give me every book you have
on demons.

646
00:39:55,312 --> 00:40:01,015
? Hey, there, lonely girl ?

647
00:40:01,017 --> 00:40:04,619
? lonely girl ?

648
00:40:04,621 --> 00:40:07,121
? let me make your broken heart
like new ?

649
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:08,356
Sir.

650
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:10,959
It's time to move on.

651
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:15,496
? Hey, there, lonely girl ?

652
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:19,500
? lonely girl ?

653
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:24,005
? don't you know
this lonely boy loves... ?

654
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:39,404
This thing is filthy.

655
00:40:39,406 --> 00:40:40,905
It's just a car, Sam.

656
00:40:40,907 --> 00:40:44,359
“It's just a...car”.

657
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,244
Wow.

658
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:48,162
You really
<i>have</i> gone dark.

659
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,533
You have no idea.

660
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:56,371
You know what, Dean?

661
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:58,006
I saw what happened
back there.

662
00:40:58,008 --> 00:41:02,293
You could have killed
that guy, and you didn't.

663
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:04,462
You took mercy on him.

664
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:06,965
You call that mercy?

665
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,434
Imagine
you spend your whole life

666
00:41:09,436 --> 00:41:12,053
hunting down the guy
that knifed your father.

667
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:14,973
When you finally
find him...

668
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:17,442
He whips you like a dog.

669
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,363
How do you think
that feels?

670
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,151
That kid's gonna spend
his whole life

671
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:31,289
knowing that he had his shot
and that he couldn't beat me.

672
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,875
That ain't mercy.

673
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:37,712
That's the worst thing
I could have done to him.

674
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,585
And what I'm gonna do
to<i> you,</i> Sammy...

675
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:47,388
Well, that ain't
gonna be mercy, either.
