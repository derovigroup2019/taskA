1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,791
Werewolves that are turned up to
four generations from pure blood

2
00:00:06,793 --> 00:00:09,794
are less feral and can transform
before, during,

3
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:12,029
<i>and</i> after the lunar cycle.

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:13,464
A human by day,

5
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:15,433
a freak animal killing machine
by moonlight.

6
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:17,201
I mean, werewolves are badass.

7
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:18,770
Best part about it is,

8
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:20,405
we already know how to
bring these suckers down --

9
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:22,373
one of these bad boys
right to the heart.

10
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,342
Dean's a demon.

11
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:25,743
I don't know how you did this,

12
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:27,478
what kind of black magic stunt
you pulled.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,482
But hear me -- I will
save my brother or die trying.

14
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:33,484
Stop! It's over, Dean!

15
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:35,386
There ain't much difference
from what I turned into

16
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:37,355
to what you already are.
What exactly is that supposed to mean?

17
00:00:37,357 --> 00:00:39,290
I know what you did
when you went looking for me.

18
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:42,560
Which one of us
is<i> really</i> a monster? Hmm?

19
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:45,496
You might actually
be worse than me.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,499
We got a whole bunch more
of these to go.

21
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:50,168
You can make it a lot easier
on yourself.

22
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,804
What the hell are we doing
to him, Cass?

23
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:54,272
The ritual of
purified blood

24
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:56,073
is the only treatment I know.

25
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:01,179
You look worried, fellas.

26
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:02,513
Welcome back, Dean.

27
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:04,415
Maybe you should, um,
take some time

28
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:06,751
before you get back to work,
allow yourself to heal.

29
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:40,985
? I saw a werewolf with
a Chinese menu in his hand ?

30
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:45,523
? walkin' through the streets
of Soho in the rain ?

31
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:50,394
<i>? he was lookin' for a place</i>
<i>called Lee ho fook's ?</i>

32
00:01:50,396 --> 00:01:54,932
<i>? gonna get a big dish</i>
<i>of beef chow mein ?</i>

33
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:57,168
<i>? aaoooooo!</i>
<i>Werewolves of London ?</i>

34
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,604
I know, right?

35
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:04,475
<i>? Aaoooooo! ?</i>

36
00:02:04,477 --> 00:02:08,479
<i>? Aaoooooo! ?</i>

37
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:10,715
<i>? I saw a werewolf</i>
<i>drinking a pi?a colada ?</i>

38
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:13,384
<i>? at Trader Vic's ?</i>

39
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:16,320
<i>? and his hair was perfect ?</i>

40
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:20,691
<i>? little old lady got</i>
<i>mutilated late last night ?</i>

41
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:24,128
Damn.
Girl after my own heart.

42
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,764
That's the idea, sweetie.

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,667
<i>? Aaoooooo! ?</i>
what the hell?

44
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:31,335
<i>? Werewolves of London ?</i>

45
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,407
<i>? Aaoooooo! ?</i>

46
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:37,975
<i>? Aaoooooo! ?</i>

47
00:02:37,977 --> 00:02:39,977
<i>? Werewolves of London ?</i>

00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:06,671
Hey, something I needed
to ask you.

51
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,107
Shoot.

52
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:12,109
You've been...

53
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:15,279
Kicked, bit,
scratched, stabbed,

54
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:18,583
possessed,<i> killed...</i>

55
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:21,018
And you sprain
your friggin' elbow?

56
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,322
Dude, it was more than
a sprain. All right?

57
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:26,390
And it was a friggin' demon,
but...

58
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:28,092
But what?

59
00:03:28,094 --> 00:03:31,896
That sling come with a slice
of crybaby pie on the side?

60
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:35,833
Please.

61
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:47,545
How you doing?

62
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:51,282
Golden, man.

63
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:53,017
Come on.

64
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:55,653
Seriously, I'm good.

65
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:56,887
I am.

66
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,456
You know, we got...

67
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,125
Three more cases of this stuff
on ice in the trunk.

68
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:03,728
Taking some “we time.”

69
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,663
best decision we ever made.

70
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:07,598
Here that.

71
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:21,445
See that thing
in the paper this morning?

72
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:25,149
Maybe it was an animal kill.

73
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:26,717
It was<i> three</i> kills,

74
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:29,754
and it was in the same town,
all within the last month.

75
00:04:29,756 --> 00:04:31,155
Yeah, you're right.

76
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:33,557
We should call some guys,
have 'em fix it.

77
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:36,060
Good. Smart.
Done.

78
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:41,899
Or...

79
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:43,234
We could be in and out.

80
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:45,703
It's a milk run.
Right,

81
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:48,539
because that happens<i> never.</i>

82
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,275
Look, Sam,
what we're doing here,

83
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:52,843
it's good, okay?

84
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:54,679
You and me hanging out.

85
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,083
But I need to work.

86
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:02,920
I need this.

87
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:08,726
If things go sideways...

88
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:11,829
I mean, like, an<i> inch,</i>

89
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:13,264
you gotta give me the heads-up.

90
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:16,100
Done. You got my word.

91
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,450
Gentlemen.

92
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:36,754
Well, I'm not gonna lie.

93
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:39,090
We're damn glad to see you.

94
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:41,125
You boys must come up
on stuff like this all the time.

95
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:42,393
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

96
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:43,594
Yeah, definitely.

97
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:45,529
Hell, seen raccoons
in rec rooms

98
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:46,764
and bears in swimming pools.

99
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:48,966
But this? You tell me.

100
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:50,735
Yeah.

101
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,474
Oh. Well, uh...

102
00:05:56,476 --> 00:05:57,942
Where do we start?

103
00:05:57,944 --> 00:05:59,510
What with, uh...Logging.

104
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:00,711
Ice caps.

105
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:02,446
Bitcoin. Yeah.

106
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:06,150
Obama.

107
00:06:06,152 --> 00:06:07,752
You know what? Maybe --

108
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:09,754
maybe, uh, you could
walk us through the attacks.

109
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:11,789
Any similarities,
anything weird.

110
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,825
Only thing weird about them
was how similar they were.

111
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:16,627
Folks torn clean through.

112
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,329
Hearts absent.

113
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:19,663
Hearts absent as in --

114
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:21,499
Consumed, most likely.

115
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:24,802
And there were no witnesses?

116
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:26,137
Well, the town square attack,
the parking lot...

117
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:28,172
Those were real late.
But the bar?

118
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:30,074
Hell, with how jammed
the place was,

119
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:32,343
you'd think somebody other than
Tommy would've seen something.

120
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:34,612
And what did he see?
Honestly, not much.

121
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:37,615
Now Tommy ain't exactly what
we call a reliable witness.

122
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:39,216
And he's telling
anybody who'll listen

123
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:41,685
he saw some girl
go out back with Barker,

124
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:43,120
and she got torn up, too.

125
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:44,455
So there was a second victim?

126
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:46,857
Well, sure...
Expect Tommy's a drunk.

127
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:48,759
There's no body, no D.N.A.,
no blood trail,

128
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:51,695
no<i> nothing</i> to suggest that.

129
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:53,264
Give me one sec.
Yeah.

130
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:57,334
Hearts missing.
Sounds wolfy to me, right?

131
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:59,270
Yeah. Pretty brazen,
even for a werewolf.

132
00:06:59,272 --> 00:07:01,939
You think it was the girl?

133
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:03,407
Let's find out.

134
00:07:04,977 --> 00:07:06,377
Yeah, Barker and I
have been raising hell,

135
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:09,647
chasing tail,
and riding for a long time.

136
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:11,949
Part of him always knew
when his clock ran out,

137
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:13,884
it wasn't gonna be pretty.

138
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:17,087
To go out like that?
By some animal?

139
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:18,489
Just ain't right.

140
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:20,925
You mind, uh, you mind
telling us what went down?

141
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:22,860
It was just another party,
you know?

142
00:07:22,862 --> 00:07:24,228
Barker went out back.
The next thing you know,

143
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,830
everyone's yelling
and screaming,

144
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:28,666
and he's all torn up.
Now the sheriff mentioned

145
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:30,334
you thought there might've been
a girl involved.

146
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,902
You think
she was killed, too?

147
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:34,638
Nope.

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,374
So there was no girl?

149
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:40,411
Couldn't say.

150
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:43,614
You know we're not cops,
right?

151
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:45,583
Badge is a badge.

152
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:48,352
Well, you should also know that
working outdoors the way we do,

153
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:50,988
we see some --
some pretty weird crap.

154
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,390
Stuff that we can't explain.

155
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:54,592
I mean, hell, half the stuff,

156
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:56,060
we wouldn't have
believed it ourselves

157
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:57,461
had we not seen it together.

158
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:59,396
Well, you don't have to live
in this town, mister.

159
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:00,764
You don't have to deal with
the ridicule.

160
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm just saying that

161
00:08:02,602 --> 00:08:05,069
crazy might not be half as crazy
as you think.

162
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:08,606
So if someone were to tell you
they saw a ghost,

163
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:10,474
you'd...believe that?

164
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:16,313
Just assume
we believe everything.

165
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:18,949
Okay, then.

166
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:20,451
The other night,

167
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:21,785
I was taking a ride
past the old Sturges farm.

168
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:23,153
You know,
thinking about the rides

169
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:25,456
me and Barker used to go on.

170
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,024
I saw her, man.

171
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:28,859
Saw her who?

172
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:30,094
The girl.

173
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:31,629
What, after the attack?
Hell, yeah.

174
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:33,998
She was just standing there,
all bloody, watching me.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,634
So -- so I turn the hell around,
I-I ran back, thinking,

176
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:38,636
damn, you know, she --
she's hurt or something.

177
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:40,738
But...She was just gone.

178
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,841
Like,<i> gone.</i>

179
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:45,809
Like a ghost.

180
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,647
No, I don't give one red cent
in hell what the cops say.

181
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,483
She was there. She was eaten.

182
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:54,652
She's a freakin' ghost.

183
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:11,468
Well...

184
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,971
Ghosts don't shred people
like that.

185
00:09:14,974 --> 00:09:16,607
Yeah, well...

186
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:18,776
This flea bag,
looks like she ain't done

187
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:21,145
chowing down
on Sons of Anarchy just yet.

188
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:23,013
Guess she likes bad boys.

189
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:25,883
Well, wait'll she gets
a load of us.

190
00:10:11,564 --> 00:10:13,764
Stop ignoring my calls.

191
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:16,500
Pick up the phone
and call me right now.

192
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:18,335
This isn't how
it's supposed to go.

193
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:21,972
Look, I've been down this road
before and I'm not going to...

194
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,452
What?

195
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:43,761
Kate?

196
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,676
I know who you are.

197
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:02,277
Congratulations.

198
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,813
After what happened at school,
I thought you'd let me go.

199
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:06,915
Yeah, well, that was before
you started dropping bodies.

200
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,418
What?
Guy at the bar saw you

201
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,953
before you went all Wolverine
on his buddy.

202
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:12,788
So...Surprise.

203
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,189
Here we are.

204
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:18,060
Kate, you said you were
gonna go straight.

205
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:20,829
What happened?

206
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:22,598
I guess things change.

207
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,800
Being this...

208
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:28,036
I tried to be strong,
but the hunger was too much.

209
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:29,238
Too hard.

210
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,073
It's not like anyone
gave me a handbook

211
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:32,774
on how to be a werewolf.

212
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,676
Looks like you're doing
a pretty good job so far.

213
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:37,379
Break some hearts,
then you eat 'em.

214
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:38,881
I was on my own.

215
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:41,316
I...evolved.

216
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:43,519
So that's what you call
killing innocent people?

217
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:49,157
Whatever you're gonna do,
just...do it.

218
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,538
Hey.

219
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:13,882
You know what?

220
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:15,150
Let me do it.

221
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,518
Why?

222
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,687
Because...

223
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:20,923
I think you should
sit this one out.

224
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:24,026
What are you talking about?
You're not ready, Dean.

225
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,399
Hello?

226
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:34,002
Warden, we had another
animal attack over at

227
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,404
the high school gymnasium.

228
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,039
Guy was a security guard.

229
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,540
Same M.O. as the other three.

230
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,375
When?
Deputy said the victim's blood

231
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:42,344
was still warm
when he got there,

232
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,879
so had to be
less than an hour ago.

233
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:45,981
Of course. Thank you.
Um, I'll be in touch.

234
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:48,817
We got a problem.

235
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,519
What, besides, uh,
werewolf Barbie over here?

236
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,387
Yeah.

237
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:55,591
There was another kill,
across town, just before dark.

238
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:57,225
Well, how did Kate
get her murder on

239
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:59,328
and then get back here b--

240
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,730
- You don't think she did it.
- Look... I don't know, man.

241
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,498
But as far as I'm concerned...

242
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:07,936
Damn it!

243
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:09,871
All right,
if she's not icing people,

244
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,373
then why play
the big bad wolf?

245
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,941
Maybe she's running
with a pack?

246
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:14,610
You know,
trying to protect them?

247
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:16,945
Well,
a hell of a price to pay.

248
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:20,482
She was about two seconds away
from taking a dirt nap.

249
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:22,417
What is that?
It's her phone.

250
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:24,953
Let's see who she was
Booty calling when we pulled up.

251
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:29,358
Thank you for calling
the Lincoln Motel.

252
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,926
Can I help you?

253
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,481
So what's this about
me not being ready back there?

254
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:55,417
I'm -- I wasn't...
trying to start something, Dean.

255
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,818
I was just saying, I thought
that was the whole point

256
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,488
of us taking a break.
You know?

257
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,223
Oh, no. No, yeah.
I get that.

258
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,325
And, you know,
there's no worries there.

259
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:05,027
Okay.

260
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:06,862
But I gotta ask.
What about you?

261
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:10,265
What about me, what?

262
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,068
Are<i> you</i> ready?

263
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,570
Why<i> wouldn't</i> I be ready?

264
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:16,938
Lester.

265
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,273
Lester?

266
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,442
<i>My wife kicked me</i>
<i>to the curb.</i>

267
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,411
<i>We haven't had sex</i>
<i>for four months,</i>

268
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,680
<i>but not that</i> she<i> hasn't</i>
<i>been having plenty.</i>

269
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:28,183
<i>It is possible that you can</i>
<i>have your revenge.</i>

270
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:31,019
<i>Who summons me,</i>
<i>and for what purpose?</i>

271
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:32,354
<i>Lester! don't!</i>

272
00:14:32,356 --> 00:14:35,157
<i>Kill my wife,</i>
<i>and my soul is yours.</i>

273
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,958
<i>Who are you?</i>

274
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,227
<i>Uhh! Ow!</i>

275
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:41,496
<i>You're a punk-ass demon!</i>

276
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:43,065
<i>And you work for</i> me<i> now.</i>

277
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,900
<i>Uhh!</i>

278
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:50,238
You're serious?
This is about Lester?

279
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,607
Um, don't get me wrong.
I'm not --

280
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:55,043
I'm not -- I'm not trying to
start anything either, okay?

281
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:58,714
I'm just saying, maybe...
maybe we oughta talk about that.

282
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,452
Okay, expect there's nothing
to talk about.

283
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:06,521
Okay.

284
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,425
Okay.

285
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,965
I just figured,
since we're opening up veins

286
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,400
that maybe you'd want
to talk about

287
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:19,701
the guy who you made
sell his soul.

288
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:22,152
The guy who<i> you</i> then killed,
right?

289
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:23,489
I mean, that's the same guy
we're talking about?

290
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,070
I was a demon.

291
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:26,108
Oh, you were a demon?
Oh, I didn't realize that.

292
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:30,612
Hey, man, Lester was gonna pay
for that soul shake

293
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:31,947
sooner or later.

294
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:33,882
So technically,
it's still on you.

295
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:37,119
What do you want from me, Dean?
Look, I w--

296
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:39,254
I'm not happy about it, okay?
But I needed to find you.

297
00:15:39,256 --> 00:15:41,456
So if I had to...

298
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,158
bend a few rules...

299
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,026
Go dark.
Go dark.

300
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,828
Sure. Label it if you want.

301
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,630
Look, man, again,
I'm not complaining, okay?

302
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:50,165
In fact, I'm doing just
the opposite of complaining.

303
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,933
I...

304
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:53,935
I just...

305
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:56,037
You know, between Lester
and the others...

306
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,006
There weren't others.

307
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,442
Okay, either way,

308
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:02,778
maybe we both needed
that time off.

309
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:12,587
This is good.
This is good.

310
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:14,790
Yeah.  Okay.

311
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:27,035
All right,
so the, uh, clerk says

312
00:16:27,037 --> 00:16:31,006
a blonde rolled into room 3
just before sunup.

313
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:33,308
She alone?
He thinks so.

314
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:40,315
She's on the move.

315
00:16:58,202 --> 00:17:00,702
What's she doing?

316
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:02,838
Looking for breakfast.

317
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,851
Kate!

318
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:17,452
It's over.

319
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:20,388
Oh, god.

320
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,458
Please, don't.
I'll give you anything you want.

321
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,727
Where's Kate?

322
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:27,495
Who?

323
00:17:27,497 --> 00:17:29,064
You were just
in her motel room.

324
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,932
What? That's my room.

325
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:32,701
Why were you following
that guy?

326
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:34,703
Robbie? I-I know him.

327
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,771
I just wanted to surprise him.

328
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:40,242
Test her.

329
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:41,776
Test me for what?

330
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:43,678
No!

331
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,881
Help! Somebody me help!

332
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:48,083
Just take it easy.

333
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:50,886
I don't want to die.

334
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:54,055
Oh! Uhh!

335
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:02,097
Stop it! Stop it!

336
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,634
don't!

337
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:09,371
She's my sister.

338
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,613
I lost her.

339
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:30,334
Kate,<i> why</i> is your sister
a werewolf, huh?

340
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:31,484
Hey. Hey.

341
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,051
Why?!
Let her talk.

342
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:34,419
I am!
Then put the gun down.

343
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:35,888
Why? So she can run again?
Nuh-uh.

344
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,190
She just saved our lives.

345
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:46,698
My sister is a werewolf
because I turned her into one.

346
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:50,903
Okay, this is the part
where you help yourself out.

347
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:53,972
I-I don't care. All right?
I'm sick of the lies.

348
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:55,908
Let me get this straight.

349
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,544
We let you run
because we take pity on you,

350
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:01,113
and you turn around
and you start making pups?

351
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:02,548
You start killing people?!

352
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,217
It's not like that!
I'm no killer.

353
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:06,685
Well, the way I remember it

354
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,821
from the snuff film
that you left us,

355
00:19:08,823 --> 00:19:11,423
is that you killed
your boyfriend's best friend.

356
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:14,893
That's because Brian went crazy.
I had no other choice.

357
00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:17,029
Okay, Kate,
if this wasn't you...

358
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,398
That's a big “if.”

359
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,966
Then who was it?

360
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:23,735
Your sister?

361
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:27,272
Your sister do this, Kate?

362
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,776
Really?

363
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:33,478
You almost took a bullet
for her, and you got nothing?

364
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,014
What do you want me to say?

365
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:38,250
The truth!
Hey, guys. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

366
00:19:38,252 --> 00:19:41,687
Can we, uh, take it
somewhere else?

367
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:43,088
Oh, yeah, sure.

368
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,723
Go grab some coffee,
maybe some bear hearts.

369
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,159
Let's party.

370
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:00,205
Just so you know,

371
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:02,774
Brian's the reason
I carry this.

372
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:04,142
Hey.

373
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:06,678
I'm just
showing you something.

374
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,350
In case I ever lose it,
like Brian did,

375
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:13,218
you won't have to kill me.

376
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,954
Yeah, well, saying it and doing
it are two different things.

377
00:20:15,956 --> 00:20:17,789
I'm serious.

378
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,892
And whether
you believe me or not,

379
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:22,394
I've never hurt anyone
who didn't deserve it.

380
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:27,199
And I have<i> never, ever</i>
eaten a human heart.

381
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:30,335
Guess that explains

382
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:33,705
all the dead chickens
back at the barn.

383
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:35,407
I eat what I can find,

384
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,743
what people won't miss,
hopefully.

385
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:40,779
Small game, deer.

386
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,648
I meditate.

387
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,216
Yoga helps.

388
00:20:44,218 --> 00:20:45,984
Yoga?

389
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:47,819
<i>Okay.</i>

390
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:50,188
You laugh, but...

391
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,924
I'll pretty much try anything

392
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:55,327
to keep that side of me
under control.

393
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:58,397
Well, that is great, Kate.

394
00:20:58,399 --> 00:20:59,765
It really is.

395
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,099
And it's nice to see
that, uh,

396
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:02,801
this hippie-dippie
new age crap has

397
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,538
had such a positive influence
over your sister.

398
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:11,243
Tasha...

399
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:15,280
She's a different story.

400
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:18,784
After I left school, I was...

401
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:20,619
Adrift.

402
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,521
Lost.

403
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:24,323
Not really sure

404
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,892
where to go or...

405
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:29,828
What to do, so...

406
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,997
I went someplace safe.

407
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,199
<i>I went home.</i>

408
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:38,503
<i>But...Even though I'd be good,</i>

409
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,341
<i>I started to think about</i>
<i>my family.</i>

410
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,109
<i>How safe were they going</i>
<i>to be?</i>

411
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:46,411
<i>I was a werewolf.</i>

412
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:49,414
<i>And then, of course,</i>
<i>there was you two.</i>

413
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:53,385
What if you showed up and tried
to kill me?

414
00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:55,387
I couldn't risk that.

415
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:59,424
So I...

416
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:02,127
walked away.

417
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:05,397
Never called, never wrote,

418
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:07,399
just...

419
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:10,002
Started a new life.

420
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:15,007
Until one day, I saw a posting
on my sister's Facebook page.

421
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:17,488
<i>Tasha had been in</i>
<i>a really bad car accident.</i>

422
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:22,981
<i>The doctors didn't think</i>
<i>she was gonna make it.</i>

423
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:26,585
<i>We were always so close,</i>

424
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:29,821
<i>so...</i>

425
00:22:29,823 --> 00:22:32,257
<i>I had to go say good-bye.</i>

426
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,464
Then...

427
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:41,233
It hit me.

428
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,535
This curse that I had,

429
00:22:43,537 --> 00:22:46,738
that had brought me nothing
but pain and suffering,

430
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,709
could actually finally
maybe do something good.

431
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:54,579
<i>If I turned Tasha</i>
<i>into a werewolf,</i>

432
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,616
<i>it would heal her wounds,</i>
<i>save her life,</i>

433
00:22:57,618 --> 00:23:00,786
<i>give her a second chance.</i>

434
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:05,323
So, uh...

435
00:23:05,325 --> 00:23:08,693
I did the unthinkable.

436
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,333
At first, I thought I'd failed,
that...

437
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:18,437
<i>Even though</i>
<i>werewolves heal quickly,</i>

438
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:22,140
<i>it was too late for Tasha.</i>

439
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:23,909
<i>Then she woke up,</i>

440
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:28,213
<i>not sick anymore, but okay.</i>

441
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:30,715
Hi. Hey.

442
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:32,017
Hi.

443
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,985
<i>Tasha had so many questions.</i>

444
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:37,189
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>How did she get here?</i>

445
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:39,791
<i>So...</i>

446
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,326
<i>I was straight with her.</i>

447
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:43,862
<i>The good, the bad, the ugly.</i>

448
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:47,432
<i>What we were and why we could</i>
<i>never go back home,</i>

449
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:51,803
and the responsibility we had
to control what we'd become.

450
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,605
I picked you up
from the hospital

451
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:56,141
I'm gonna take you
someplace safe, okay?

452
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,643
<i>It was a lot to swallow.</i>

453
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,446
<i>But we had each other,</i>

454
00:24:01,448 --> 00:24:03,415
<i>and that felt like enough.</i>

455
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:08,220
Or...So I thought.

456
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:38,950
<i>My sister,</i>
<i>she gave in to everything</i>

457
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:42,087
<i>that I had warned her about.</i>
<i>And...</i>

458
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,822
<i>I knew,</i>

459
00:24:43,824 --> 00:24:47,659
<i>even if I couldn't bring myself</i>
<i>to admit it then...</i>

460
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,131
I knew I was losing her.

461
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:55,033
So back at the barn,

462
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:59,471
that was all just an act
to protect Tasha?

463
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:02,307
She's family.

464
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:06,478
And, yeah,
worth eating a bullet for.

465
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:11,249
And she needs me now
more than ever.

466
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:13,752
This is<i> my</i> mess.
I gotta clean it up.

467
00:25:13,754 --> 00:25:15,754
And how do you plan
on doing that, Kate?

468
00:25:15,756 --> 00:25:17,656
By getting Tasha out of here.

469
00:25:17,658 --> 00:25:19,491
She hasn't listened to you yet.

470
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:21,226
Why do you think
she's gonna start now?

471
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,461
I don't know, but...

472
00:25:23,463 --> 00:25:25,163
I've gotta try.

473
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:27,332
Y-you know, we'll go out
into the woods.

474
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:28,733
We'll drop out
for however long it takes

475
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,735
until she learns
to control this.

476
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,471
Little late for team building,
do you think?

477
00:25:33,473 --> 00:25:35,340
So, what?

478
00:25:35,342 --> 00:25:37,976
I just abandon her?

479
00:25:37,978 --> 00:25:39,844
I did this.

480
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:42,147
I owe her every chance
to make it right.

481
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:43,815
What if she never does?

482
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,386
Then I'll take care of it.

483
00:25:48,388 --> 00:25:50,488
You'll take care of it?

484
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,591
You know what that means?

485
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,160
Why don't you ask Brian?

486
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:00,599
Well, maybe it doesn't have
to come to that.

487
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,933
You know, if you had

488
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,535
shot straight with us
from the get-go,

489
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:06,204
we might've been able
to help you a lot sooner.

490
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:07,906
What do you mean?

491
00:26:07,908 --> 00:26:10,108
By curing you both.

492
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,043
Shut up.

493
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:14,980
Yeah, okay,
or you're welcome.

494
00:26:14,982 --> 00:26:17,682
There is no cure for werewolves.

495
00:26:17,684 --> 00:26:20,252
And for a long time,
that was true,

496
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:21,987
but we found one.

497
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,190
Now we've got everything
we need on our end.

498
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:28,226
Okay? But the clock
is tickin',

499
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:31,162
and we need one more thing --
Tasha.

500
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:34,833
Unless you wanna do this
without her.

501
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:36,868
N-no. No.

502
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,672
It's a long drive, but...

503
00:26:40,674 --> 00:26:42,507
I know where to find her.

504
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,513
Dude, what are you doing?
There is no cure.

505
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:50,949
There's one.

506
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:52,984
Dean, it's a little more
complicated than that.

507
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,419
Kate and Tasha are monsters,
okay?

508
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:55,920
Last I checked,
we kill monsters.

509
00:26:55,922 --> 00:26:57,656
Right, but how can you
possibly blame Kate

510
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,724
for fighting for her sister?
We do it all the time.

511
00:26:59,726 --> 00:27:01,626
Well, yeah, and that's
worked wonders for us.

512
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:03,695
Well, we're still here,
aren't we?

513
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:07,265
Yeah, but is it right?

514
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:09,567
I mean, all that you've done for
me, I've still got this Mark.

515
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:11,202
And we'll figure that out.
We always do.

516
00:27:11,204 --> 00:27:13,305
But you can't take whatever's
happened to us or to you

517
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:15,907
and -- and dump it
at these girls' feet.

518
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,844
All right, so, what?
You wanna nuance this thing?

519
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,414
Hit me. What's your plan?

520
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:35,060
Kate?

521
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,363
She's out.

522
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,964
Okay. Then, um...

523
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:43,034
I gotta tell you something.
I, uh...

524
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:48,340
I lied about Lester.

525
00:27:48,342 --> 00:27:50,775
What?

526
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:52,644
There were others.

527
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:55,647
Other humans?
No. No, no. And --

528
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:57,148
and I'm sure there were
a few hunters I rubbed --

529
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,385
or I...punched the wrong way,

530
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,687
but...No.

531
00:28:02,689 --> 00:28:06,024
I pretty much saved
my best stuff for the bad guys.

532
00:28:06,026 --> 00:28:08,293
But you gotta
understand something, Dean.

533
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:11,062
I watched you die.

534
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,564
And I carried you.

535
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,800
I carried your corpse

536
00:28:15,802 --> 00:28:19,637
into your room,
and I put your dead body

537
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,272
on your bed,

538
00:28:21,274 --> 00:28:24,442
and then you just...

539
00:28:24,444 --> 00:28:26,511
Yeah.

540
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:27,812
Yeah.

541
00:28:27,814 --> 00:28:30,014
I know.

542
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:32,150
I guess I was hoping
that note would, you know,

543
00:28:32,152 --> 00:28:34,052
fill in the blanks.

544
00:28:34,054 --> 00:28:36,855
“Don't look for me”?
<i>That</i> note?

545
00:28:36,857 --> 00:28:40,291
Yeah, that was
really informative. Thanks.

546
00:28:41,194 --> 00:28:43,294
Yeah.

547
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:44,763
I...

548
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,765
What?

549
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,701
It's embarrassing, you know?

550
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:52,137
W-what's embarrassing?
All of it.

551
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,441
You know, the -- the --
that note.

552
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,077
Crowley.

553
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,779
Everything.

554
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,347
Dean, you were a demon.

555
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:04,783
I was a demon? Oh, thanks.
I didn't -- I didn't realize.

556
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,118
Shut up.

557
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:14,826
Not to mention,
I never even said “thank you”"

558
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:16,661
so...

559
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:22,167
You don't ever have to
say that, not to me.

560
00:29:24,171 --> 00:29:25,637
Well...

561
00:29:27,507 --> 00:29:29,974
Good. Then I guess...

562
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,643
Guess it's all gravy.

563
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:35,747
Little R&R
and we are back at it.

564
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:42,053
Hey.

565
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:43,855
How we doing?

566
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,125
We're getting close.

567
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:51,329
What is this place?

568
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,997
Ever since Tasha and I
were little,

569
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,300
we've been coming up
to this cabin with our parents.

570
00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:57,936
Now why do you think
Tasha will even be here?

571
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:00,338
When she because a wolf,
we knew it was gonna be hard,

572
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,208
so we kinda came up
with this escape plan

573
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,310
in case things ever got bad.

574
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,812
So it's a rendezvous spot?

575
00:30:07,814 --> 00:30:09,714
Pretty much.

576
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:34,305
Now what?

577
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:37,742
Maybe I should go in first,
explain all this?

578
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:40,144
Sounds good.

579
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:43,648
What are doing?!

580
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,254
You son of a bitch!

581
00:30:50,657 --> 00:30:53,625
There is no cure, is there?

582
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,427
I trusted you.

583
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:01,266
It's not her fault.

584
00:31:01,268 --> 00:31:02,867
It's mine.

585
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:05,370
She killed people.
Because I did this to her, okay?

586
00:31:05,372 --> 00:31:07,705
So if you want
your pound of flesh, take me.

587
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:09,173
We'll deal with you later.

588
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:10,475
But she can be saved!

589
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:12,410
No.

590
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,313
Tasha's in too deep.

591
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:18,149
You don't ever come back
from that,

592
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:19,951
not ever.

593
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:27,058
Come on, Sammy.

594
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,961
No!

595
00:31:29,963 --> 00:31:32,730
Please!
don't do this!

596
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:35,500
Don't!

597
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,137
Please, Sam!

598
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:41,205
Please don't!

599
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:34,626
I can't believe
my own sister betrayed me.

600
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:38,630
Yeah, expect...she didn't.

601
00:32:38,632 --> 00:32:40,431
You're not gonna shoot me.

602
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:42,333
And why is that?

603
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,701
Sam.

604
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:57,234
Drop the gun, or Dreamreat here
gets his mind blown.

605
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,706
Don't do it, Sam. Uhh!

606
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,911
Well...Sammy?

607
00:33:12,387 --> 00:33:13,953
Tasha!

608
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:16,956
What did --
who are these people?

609
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:18,892
Brandon. Travis.

610
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:20,827
I turned them.

611
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:22,495
They're our new family.

612
00:33:22,497 --> 00:33:24,531
Yeah, you're a regular
psycho Brady Bunch.

613
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:26,533
Hey!

614
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,405
No!

615
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:34,307
You've always had
crappy taste in guys.

616
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:36,576
Tasha, we can talk about this.

617
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:39,879
They were gonna kill me.

618
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:41,548
And now
you're protecting them?

619
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,917
No. I'm protecting<i> you.</i>

620
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,986
Yeah. I'm good. Thanks.

621
00:33:46,988 --> 00:33:48,621
So here's how it's gonna be.

622
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:52,258
You can walk away
or you can join my pack.

623
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,994
I'm not walking away.

624
00:33:54,996 --> 00:33:59,032
Then prove
you got what it takes.

625
00:34:00,402 --> 00:34:02,135
Eat his heart out.

626
00:34:06,775 --> 00:34:08,274
Kate.

627
00:34:10,512 --> 00:34:13,079
You don't have to do this.

628
00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:15,481
No one's talking to you,
Paul Bunyan.

629
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:23,289
So?

630
00:34:24,593 --> 00:34:27,193
No.

631
00:34:29,397 --> 00:34:32,365
Take them. Have some fun.

632
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,801
Oh, and I want a heart to-go.

633
00:34:34,803 --> 00:34:36,502
Put it in a doggie bag.

634
00:34:40,775 --> 00:34:42,041
On your knees!

635
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:44,811
Wow. Well,
I'm awfully flat--uhh!

636
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:46,980
Ohh! Uhh!

637
00:34:49,384 --> 00:34:51,918
T., I can help you
get better.

638
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,653
Oh, I<i> am</i> better.

639
00:34:53,655 --> 00:34:56,022
And smarter and stronger

640
00:34:56,024 --> 00:34:57,857
and awesome.

641
00:34:57,859 --> 00:35:00,226
I'm a freakin' superhero.

642
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:02,128
Who kills innocent people?

643
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,931
No, that's not you.

644
00:35:04,933 --> 00:35:06,766
You were a good kid.

645
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:09,903
I was<i> weak</i> and scared.

646
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:12,272
I let people
walk all over me --

647
00:35:12,274 --> 00:35:14,240
mom, dad,

648
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:16,843
friends, boyfriends,

649
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:19,112
you.

650
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:21,247
But I'm not weak anymore.

651
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:23,549
And I'm not scared.

652
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:25,785
I'm<i> scary.</i>

653
00:35:25,787 --> 00:35:28,655
I was trying to give you
a second chance.

654
00:35:28,657 --> 00:35:30,924
You wouldn't have been...
normal,

655
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:33,293
but we would've had
each other.

656
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:34,894
We still can.

657
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:36,562
But I'm not gonna
spend my life on the run

658
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:39,532
from people like
Mary-Kate and Ashley out there.

659
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:41,534
We're strong, Kate.

660
00:35:41,536 --> 00:35:43,703
We can go anywhere we want.

661
00:35:43,705 --> 00:35:45,305
We<i> do</i> anything we want.

662
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:48,141
And of anyone gets
in our way...

663
00:35:50,045 --> 00:35:52,745
You don't have to be alone
anymore.

664
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:56,649
We can do this together.

665
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:58,384
You okay?

666
00:35:58,386 --> 00:35:59,852
I've been better.

667
00:35:59,854 --> 00:36:02,922
These guys, huh?
Can you believe 'em?

668
00:36:02,924 --> 00:36:04,991
Yeah, a couple of minor leaguers.
Yo!

669
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:07,427
You're dead.
You don't get to talk.

670
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:08,861
In fact --
uhh!

671
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,101
Uhh!

672
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:19,405
Well,
welcome to the majors, boys.

673
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:23,443
Kate...

674
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:25,578
We're gonna be good, okay?

675
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:29,215
We're gonna be great.

676
00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:31,818
I love you.

677
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,087
I love you, too.

678
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:47,100
I'm sorry.

679
00:36:53,408 --> 00:36:56,009
I'm<i> so</i> sorry.

680
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:29,135
So we going after her?

681
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,807
I don't know, Dean.

682
00:37:36,912 --> 00:37:39,679
But you gotta admit,
when push came to kill,

683
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:42,148
she did good.

684
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,818
Yeah.

685
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,720
So maybe it's a good thing
you didn't shoot her.

686
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,055
Really? You're gonna Monday
morning quarterback this thing?

687
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:54,327
If you got an itch
to scratch...

688
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:57,831
Dean, look,
we both jumped on this case.

689
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:00,600
I agree.
Equal parts blame there.

690
00:38:00,602 --> 00:38:04,304
But the whole idea behind
laying low was to rest,

691
00:38:04,306 --> 00:38:07,507
to...try and deal with
everything we --

692
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:09,876
everything<i> you</i> went through.

693
00:38:09,878 --> 00:38:12,612
Maybe we jumped back in
too fast.

694
00:38:12,614 --> 00:38:15,415
I mean, Dean,
you were a demon.

695
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:18,051
You still have the Mark.

696
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:19,586
Didn't you ever wanna
talk about it?

697
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,255
Talk about it?
Talk about it how?

698
00:38:22,257 --> 00:38:23,723
Come on, man.
I<i> am</i> coming on, Sam.

699
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:26,259
Look, I know what happened.

700
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:29,729
Okay? I was there.
Remember?

701
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:32,999
I'm not trying to get by it.
I just...

702
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:34,668
That's not what
this was about.

703
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,203
Then what is this about?

704
00:38:37,205 --> 00:38:39,472
About gettin'
back in the saddle. Okay?

705
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:43,009
Doing something good,
not stewing in my own crap.

706
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,980
And what if you're not ready?

707
00:38:57,893 --> 00:39:00,326
Well, I'll give you
one thing.

708
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:02,295
Pretty damned good
at getaways.

709
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:03,997
Yeah.

710
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:06,399
Well, I decided that living
was better than being dead.

711
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:08,702
For what it's worth,
thank you.

712
00:39:08,704 --> 00:39:11,104
At the end of the day,
she was your sister.

713
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:15,108
No. She wasn't.

714
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:19,512
Listen to me, Kate.

715
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:20,914
You keep moving,
keep your nose clean,

716
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,249
and we can stop meeting
like this.

717
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:24,651
I hear ya.

718
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,120
And I will,

719
00:39:27,122 --> 00:39:30,957
but I'm not gonna promise,
'cause...

720
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:34,594
Yeah.

721
00:39:34,596 --> 00:39:36,229
See you around, kid.

722
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:38,631
I sure as hell hope not.

723
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:23,143
Let's say you're right.

724
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:24,544
About what?

725
00:40:24,546 --> 00:40:26,946
Everything.

726
00:40:26,948 --> 00:40:30,617
Maybe I'm not ready
to hunt.

727
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:38,224
But I am just trying to
do the right thing, man,

728
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:41,561
'cause I'm so sick and tired
of doing the wrong one.

729
