1
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:02,718
I know what I want.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,188
But I can't have it --
not how you live.

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:06,523
I'm trying
to get over you.

4
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:08,158
Just 'cause
you love someone

5
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:09,776
doesn't mean you should stick
around and screw up their life.

6
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:11,895
You know you're walking out
on your family, right?

7
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:13,113
What do you know
about dragons?

8
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:15,449
Dr. Visyak.
Medieval studies, S.F.U.

9
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,250
Dr. Visyak:
Bobby Singer.

10
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:19,402
Tell him something for me
next time you see him.

11
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,888
Actually,
just kick him in the jewels.

12
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:24,374
- Raphael...
- Tomorrow you kneel, Castiel.

13
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:27,642
Are you proposing that I start
a civil war in heaven?

14
00:00:27,643 --> 00:00:28,624
Ding! Ding! Ding!

15
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,680
- Balthazar.
- Of course I want to help you.

16
00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:32,549
I mean, the amount of power
that it would take

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,817
to mount a war --

18
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:36,470
But what if I said
I knew how to go nuclear?

19
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:37,921
Purgatory.

20
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:41,024
You and Crowley have been
going after Purgatory together?

21
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:43,777
- Just kill the Winchesters.
- No.

22
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,879
Then I'll do it myself.

23
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:47,397
If you touch a hair
on their heads,

24
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,933
I will tear it all down --
our arrangement.

25
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:52,986
Hello, Dean.

26
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,321
You are
like a brother to me.

27
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,623
So, if I'm asking you
not to do something,

28
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:58,291
you got to trust me,
man.

29
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:00,043
Or what?

30
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,779
Or I'll have to do
what I have to do to stop you.

31
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:03,163
I'm sorry, Dean.

32
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:05,165
I'm sorry, Dean.

33
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,122
Hello?

34
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,112
Hello?

35
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:34,704
Please...

36
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:35,722
We didn't know.

37
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:37,373
I'm sorry!

38
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:50,567

40
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,300
Well, you know what?
At least you tried.

41
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:02,636
Yeah, a fat lot
of good it did.

42
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,605
Why did he even come,
right?

43
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:09,610
Well, Samuel's journals
are pointless.

44
00:03:09,677 --> 00:03:11,228
I mean, I'm sorry,
but, uh,

45
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:13,397
Jebediah Campbell
has squat to tell me

46
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:16,066
about how to stop Cass
from cracking Purgatory.

47
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,069
Well, actually, it's not about
the journals we have.

48
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:20,854
It's about
the one we don't.

49
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:22,439
Meaning what?

50
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:24,675
Well, that's
the bad news.

51
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:28,328
Our pal Cass didn't stop in
last night just to mend fences.

52
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:30,998
What did he do?

53
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,217
- Stole something.
- What?

54
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:35,803
The journal
of one Moishe Campbell.

55
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,171
"Moishe"?

56
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:38,422
Of the New York
Campbells.

57
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:42,426
Uh, so we got to
get it back, right?

58
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,045
Or just read the copy
I had already made.

59
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:48,465
Hi. Glad to meet you.
Bobby Singer, paranoid bastard.

60
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:52,519
I think I zeroed in
on something.

61
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,404
What do you got?

62
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:57,858
"Went to talk
to Howard Phillips

63
00:03:57,909 --> 00:03:59,493
about the events
of March 10th."

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,413
That's March 10, 1937.

65
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:03,914
All right, so,
who's this Phillips guy?

66
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:06,533
Phillips ain't his last name.
It's Lovecraft.

67
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:08,168
Wait -- H.P. Lovecraft?

68
00:04:08,236 --> 00:04:09,920
Let me see that.

69
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:11,472
Am I supposed to know
who that is?

70
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:14,591
Horror writer?

71
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,243
"At the mountains
of madness,"

72
00:04:16,294 --> 00:04:18,879
"the call of Cthulhu."

73
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:21,215
Yeah.

74
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,851
No, I'm -- I was too busy
having sex with women.

75
00:04:25,637 --> 00:04:27,971
Well, anyhow,
there's one notion that comes up

76
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:30,590
over and over again
in his stories --

77
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:32,643
namely, opening doors
to other dimensions

78
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:34,194
and letting
scary crap through.

79
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:35,746
You don't say.

80
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:36,930
Wait, so you're saying
you think

81
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:39,316
Lovecraft knew something
about Purgatory?

82
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,453
All I know is,
Moishe paid him a visit.

83
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:49,042
? <i>You must be livin'</i>
<i>with a four-leaf clover</i> ?

84
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,046
? <i>the number 7 running</i>
<i>all the way through you</i> ?

85
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:06,510
Mnh!

86
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:11,648
Oh! No!

87
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:16,904
Just --
just let her go.

88
00:05:16,988 --> 00:05:18,572
Okay, just --
aah!

89
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,857
No!

90
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:20,574
No!

91
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,366
No!

92
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:38,091
Ben?

93
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,159
- There's men in the house.
- What?

94
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,794
They killed Matt.
They got mom.

95
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:42,045
They're coming.
I hear them.

96
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,496
- What are they?
- I-I don't know.

97
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:44,664
- Did you see their eyes?
- No.

98
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:46,383
- Teeth?
- No.

99
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,469
This is important, Ben.
I need to know.

100
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:48,671
Dean, I don't know.

101
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:50,387
- Ben, where are you now?
- In my room.

102
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,139
Can you get to your mom's closet?
I left a shotgun in there.

103
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,724
No! Dean, what do I do?

104
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:58,395
Okay, Ben, listen to me.

105
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,864
Go to your window...
And jump.

106
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:02,349
- What?!
- Any bones you break

107
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,484
won't compare to what
they're gonna do to you, Ben.

108
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:05,819
- You've got to jump.
- Okay, I'm going.

109
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:09,039
I'm coming right now.

110
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,409
I'm gonna get you and your mom,
I promise.

111
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:14,545
You with me, Ben?

112
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:16,213
Ben?

113
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,801
Ben!

114
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:28,208
Hello, Dean.

115
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:31,711
Fancy a chat?

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,260
God, how long's it been

117
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:40,329
since my so-called
demise, yes?

118
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,883
Crowley,
let them go now.

119
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,884
Or I swear --

120
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,102
Right, right.

121
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,471
You'll rip me
a cornucopia of orifices.

122
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:51,440
Let's get to the bit
where I tell you how this goes.

123
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:54,310
Your chocolate's been in my
peanut butter for far too long.

124
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:55,978
I'm going to kill you.

125
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,614
Oh, Dean.
Ever the wit.

126
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:00,533
I've got your --
what are they? --

127
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,852
Ex-ladyfriend
and not-kid,

128
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:07,656
and I'm keeping them
until I'm satisfied

129
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,125
that you've backed
the hell off.

130
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:12,411
I'm telling you --
last chance to let 'em go easy.

131
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:14,547
You're adorable
when you get all threatening.

132
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:16,966
Don't worry --
I won't hurt them,

133
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:20,369
provided you and Jolly Green
stand down.

134
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,471
Got it? Splendid.

135
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:23,556
Kisses.

136
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:31,430
What's the story?

137
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:34,383
He said Lisa and Ben
keep breathing...

138
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,102
As long as we
sit on our thumbs.

139
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:41,490
You think
Cass knows about this?

140
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:43,826
We got to assume
he does.

141
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:46,162
So what are we
gonna do?

142
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:48,447
I'll tell you
what we're <i>not</i> gonna do --

143
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:49,582
sit here.

144
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,066
- I'm going after 'em.
- I'm coming with.

145
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:52,401
No, Sam.

146
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:54,787
You and Bobby stay
on the Lovecraft thing, okay?

147
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:56,672
Cass is already
way ahead of us.

148
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:59,275
You got to be nuts if you think
I'm gonna let you do this alone.

149
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:00,960
Bobby can
take care of the case.

150
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:02,744
- No, guys.
- Bobby...

151
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:06,465
This is a big ball. Okay?
We can't drop it now.

152
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,517
Fine.

153
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:11,103
Then how are you two
gonna find Lisa and Ben?

154
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:30,956
I'm sorry, boys.

155
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,441
Do I <i>look</i> like
a manservant to you?

156
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:38,564
No? No? Then quit
ringing for me. <i>Please.</i>

157
00:08:38,632 --> 00:08:39,882
This is important,
Balthazar.

158
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:41,217
I was drinking a '75 Dom

159
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:43,302
out of a soprano's navel
when you called.

160
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:44,303
<i>That</i> was important.

161
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:45,754
Crowley's alive.

162
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,810
Well,
you've been scooped.

163
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:52,311
Cass already told me.

164
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,063
Well, did Cass tell you

165
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,266
that he is Crowley's butt buddy,
you smug little dick?

166
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,401
Excuse me?
Handshake deal.

167
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:02,137
Go halfsies
on all the souls of Purgatory --

168
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:03,772
He fill you in
on that?

169
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:06,192
Well, yes, yes.
Yes, of course he did. Yes.

170
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:08,077
Oh, yes, of course.
I -- I --

171
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:09,978
We can read it
all over your face.

172
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,449
Crowley and Cass took two people
who are very important to me.

173
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,984
And I care about this
because...

174
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:18,120
Because maybe
there is a shred of decency

175
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:19,955
underneath this --
this snarky crap.

176
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,375
They're innocent people,

177
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,877
and I'm asking
for your help.

178
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:25,878
Hmm.

179
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:27,830
I see.

180
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:29,348
Fair enough.

181
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:32,518
Son of a bitch!

182
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,437
Look, Dean,
let's just call Cass.

183
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:37,042
Maybe he doesn't know
anything about --

184
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,023
We are not calling Cass.

185
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,025
- Yeah, but, Dean --
- We're not calling Cass!

186
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,527
So what, then?

187
00:09:48,118 --> 00:09:51,520
You know, uh, horror --
lowbrow.

188
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:54,123
Put us
in the ghetto, fine.

189
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,376
But H.P. Lovecraft --
this guy is <i>literature.</i>

190
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,696
I mean, he -- he should be
taught in schools.

191
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:03,532
He's up there with Dickens
and...Dean R. Koontz.

192
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,134
Seriously.

193
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,585
Well, that's --
that's definitely

194
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,087
the angle I'm taking
with my piece.

195
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:09,471
Oh, okay. Okay.

196
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,840
Sorry. You can --
please, please.

197
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:17,146
So, I hear you have
a large collection

198
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:18,880
of Lovecraft's
private letters.

199
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:19,982
Yeah.

200
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:22,234
World's largest.

201
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,402
Wow.

202
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:25,354
You must be
catnip to the ladies.

203
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,392
I'm in a long-term
online relationship, so...

204
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:37,316
Well, I'd like to ask you
about Lovecraft's last years --

205
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:41,203
specifically anything
that might have gone down

206
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:43,071
around March 10, 1937.

207
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:44,373
Okay.

208
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:46,258
A-are you working on this
with the other guy?

209
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:47,710
Other guy?

210
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:49,044
Yeah, uh, you know,

211
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:51,430
trenchcoat, looks like Columbo,
talks like Rain Man?

212
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:53,632
Right.

213
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,017
W-we're...

214
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:55,935
Competitors.

215
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,804
Rival magazines.

216
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:00,556
Okay.

217
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:04,360
Okay, well, um,
I'll tell you what I told him.

218
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:08,597
Howard had a dinner party
on March 10th.

219
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:09,431
Party?

220
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:11,951
How many friends
at this party?

221
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:13,452
Well, six --

222
00:11:13,536 --> 00:11:14,954
if by "friends" you mean

223
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:17,122
co-worshippers
in a black-magic cult.

224
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:21,577
They were getting together
that night to perform a ritual.

225
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:22,795
Something big.

226
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:24,096
Define "big."

227
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:26,949
Not much. Just open a door
into another dimension.

228
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:28,968
Why would they do that?!

229
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:31,253
To see what's out there --
you know, maybe it's friendly.

230
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:33,138
It's never friendly!

231
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:35,774
I mean...I imagine.

232
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:38,694
So, did it work --
the spell?

233
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:42,781
Well, uh, there was
no mention of Cthulhu

234
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:44,966
in the morning
papers, so...

235
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:48,404
Actually,
I do happen to have

236
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:50,972
several letters
detailing the dinner.

237
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:53,359
Worst thing that was reported
was a hangover,

238
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:54,943
so it's, uh...

239
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:56,662
- Got it --
- I've got them right here.

240
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,480
Some -- it's actually
pretty interesting.

241
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:00,716
Um, and --
and they were...

242
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:03,752
They were --
they were right th--

243
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,421
they were right here.

244
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:08,040
Well, it's not like
an invisible guy

245
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:09,958
could just pop in
and steal 'em, right?

246
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,494
Right. Right.

247
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,463
- Oh, uh,
- I'll leave you to it,

248
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:17,016
and, uh, you call me
if you find 'em, huh?

249
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:20,519
Okay, hey...

250
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:21,637
Thanks.

251
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:24,690
Thanks again
for dropping by, huh?

252
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:29,194
Lovecraft tried to Jimmy
a damn dimensional door.

253
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,195
Idjit.

254
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,313
So, what happened?

255
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:32,348
Oh, nothing much...

256
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:35,034
Except I dug.

257
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:37,736
And every guest
invited to the hoedown --

258
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:39,872
dead or disappeared
inside a year.

259
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:43,409
Wow. Um, so,
where are you off to now?

260
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:45,527
Have a chat
with one of the guests.

261
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:48,530
Wait, didn't you just say
that everyone there died?

262
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:51,333
Yeah, everybody
Lovecraft <i>invited</i> died.

263
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:53,502
Seems the maid
had a 9-year-old boy.

264
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:54,837
He was there.

265
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:58,557
So he'd be, what,
83 years old now? Where is he?

266
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,726
Same place he's been
ever since the big night --

267
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,144
locked in a mental ward.

268
00:13:02,211 --> 00:13:03,312
I see.

269
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,264
Um...Well,
keep me posted, huh?

270
00:13:05,348 --> 00:13:07,232
Okay. Stay in touch.

271
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:08,817
How's things
going there?

272
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:11,253
You got a lead
on Lisa and Ben?

273
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:13,188
Well, we're making
a few inquiries.

274
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:20,195
Slow going.

275
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:21,613
How's Dean?

276
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:23,031
About how you'd expect.

277
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:26,735
Next customer.

278
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:33,709
Look, I don't know
anything.

279
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,044
Yeah, we'll see.

280
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:43,251
Dean?

281
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:45,587
Yeah?

282
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:50,192
Look, man, y-you're
running on, what, uh,

283
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:53,479
whiskey and coffee and whatever
else you're taking.

284
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:54,646
Yeah, and?

285
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,599
And we're grasping
at straws here, man.

286
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,535
Look, I kill enough
of these demons,

287
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:02,321
eventually one of them's
gonna tell me where Crowley is.

288
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:03,956
So, we good?

289
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,791
Well, look, you've been at it
for a while.

290
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,543
Why don't you at least
let me take over?

291
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,044
- You deserve a break.
- No, thanks.

292
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:10,445
- Dean --
- Sam, back off.

293
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:15,250
Lisa and Ben --

294
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:18,470
wherever they are,
that is 100% on me.

295
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:20,055
And if they are hurt...

296
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:25,794
I'll yell
if I need you.

297
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:45,998
Castiel, it's Sam.

298
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:47,533
Um...

299
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:50,869
So, look, I don't know if you're
in on this whole Ben/Lisa thing,

300
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:54,155
but if you have
any heart whatsoever,

301
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,291
bring them back to us, man.

302
00:14:56,342 --> 00:14:57,709
Come on.

303
00:14:57,794 --> 00:14:59,661
Please.

304
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:01,513
I'm begging you.

305
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:05,617
I am <i>begging</i> you.
Do you understand?

306
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:21,733
? Smiling faces sometimes ?

307
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:24,119
Sweetie...

308
00:15:24,186 --> 00:15:25,287
You look tense.

309
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:26,655
You took Ben and Lisa.

310
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:29,157
Oh. That.

311
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:30,492
I told you --

312
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:32,878
Not to touch
Sam and Dean.

313
00:15:32,962 --> 00:15:34,746
I've respected that.

314
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:37,749
I'm merely exploiting
the obvious loophole.

315
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:40,535
As long as I have
the woman and the boy,

316
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:42,254
your fop-coiffed
little heroes

317
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:44,289
will be scouring
the Earth for <i>them --</i>

318
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:47,142
therefore,
not you and not me.

319
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:49,344
Everybody wins.

320
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:51,797
You should have
talked to me first.

321
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:55,317
I'd rather ask forgiveness
than permission.

322
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:56,485
Where are they, Crowley?

323
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:02,824
You are not to harm them.

324
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:04,192
Do you understand me?

325
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:05,110
You know what?

326
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:09,831
You're maxed out
on putting humans out of bounds.

327
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,399
I'll do with them
as I please.

328
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:15,037
You want to stop me?

329
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:16,955
Go find
friggin' Purgatory!

330
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:25,797
Call on the bat phone?

331
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:28,684
Never call during
business hours, do they?

332
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:34,556
I'll be back.

333
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,896
Cass, Cass, Cass.
So good of you to come.

334
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:44,116
Balthazar,
why'd you summon me here?

335
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,020
Can I ask you
a direct question?

336
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:49,288
Of course.

337
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:51,907
Are you in flagrante
with the King of Hades?

338
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:55,978
Of course not.

339
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:00,782
Always were
such a terrible liar.

340
00:17:02,618 --> 00:17:05,420
So it's true.

341
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:06,888
All right, then.

342
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:08,106
Why?

343
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:10,942
It's a means to an end.

344
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,146
Balthazar,
you understand that.

345
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,747
Oh, absolutely.

346
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,649
What's the end here,
exactly?

347
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:21,269
You know, raid Purgatory, snatch
up all the souls? Win the war.

348
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:24,406
And I can only assume that
you'd be the vessel, correct?

349
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:28,860
Suck up all those souls
into yourself -- all that power.

350
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:31,113
It's the only way.

351
00:17:31,164 --> 00:17:34,249
Or too much juice for you,
in which case you explode,

352
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:37,619
taking a substantial chunk
of the planet along with you.

353
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:39,320
- That won't happen.
- Sure, sure.

354
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:40,505
Of course.

355
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:42,824
Just...

356
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:47,662
Just tell me
that it's entirely risk-free.

357
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:52,217
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you, but I need to know.

358
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:54,669
Are you with me or not?

359
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:07,482
You know, you may be
certifiable, but...

360
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:10,018
Fine.

361
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,353
In for a penny...

362
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,406
In for a pound.

363
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,411
How'd you hear
about this, anyway?

364
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:21,029
Oh, your howler monkeys,
of course.

365
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,131
See, they're
just a touch worked up

366
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,884
about that kidnapping
business, you know.

367
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:32,090
Woman on P.A. System:
<i>Paging Dr. Bender.</i>

368
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:35,543
You're sure you're not
with that other reporter?

369
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:36,544
In the coat?

370
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:43,151
Liar, that one --
not who he says.

371
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:44,469
No, sir.

372
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:46,471
Uh, I'm not...

373
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:50,025
Affiliated
with his paper.

374
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:51,693
I just have
a couple of questions

375
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:54,729
about a dinner party
you were at in 1937.

376
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:59,534
Everyone's so fascinated.

377
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:01,670
Want to know
about my night

378
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:06,508
at the home
of the great H.P. Lovecraft?

379
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:08,543
If you don't mind.

380
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:10,178
Well, you know the story.

381
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:15,350
They did their spell,
and they all said it failed.

382
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,022
Do you believe in
monsters?

383
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:23,308
Yup.

384
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:27,929
You know,
you go saying that,

385
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,266
they'll lock you in here
rest of your life.

386
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,735
Whatever you saw...

387
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:36,104
you tell me,
and I'll buy it straight.

388
00:19:39,441 --> 00:19:41,510
The spell worked.

389
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:46,614
A door opened,
and something came through.

390
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:51,503
B-but it was invisible,
so no one knew.

391
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,288
Except me.

392
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:55,423
How did you know, then?

393
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:57,092
Because it took my mother!

394
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:00,378
It went into her.

395
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:04,816
She wasn't the same.
She even smelled different.

396
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:09,304
And then
she disappeared.

397
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,608
And --
surprise, surprise --

398
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:17,829
one by one,
they all start dying.

399
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,118
I'm sorry...

400
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:24,653
About your mom.

401
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:32,577
You're the first person
ever said that.

402
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:38,834
Hey. You want to see
a picture?

403
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:41,303
Hmm?

404
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:56,401
I'll be damned.

405
00:21:06,796 --> 00:21:10,498
I promise you, pal...

406
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,000
You start talking...

407
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,971
...or I swear

408
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:18,473
I will rip your skin off,

409
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,760
strip by strip.

410
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:24,763
And then I'm gonna kill you.

411
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:29,034
And then I'm gonna
do it to the next demon.

412
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:30,569
You hear me?

413
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:31,719
Yeah.

414
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,722
I hear you.

415
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:45,066
So you can stop talking,
you miserable sack.

416
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:47,919
Agh!

417
00:22:05,596 --> 00:22:07,413
I didn't
ask for your help.

418
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:10,765
Well, regardless,
you're welcome.

419
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:13,961
Why are you here?

420
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,796
I had no idea Crowley
would take Lisa and Ben.

421
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:22,464
Yeah, right.

422
00:22:25,918 --> 00:22:27,302
You don't believe me.

423
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,205
I don't believe a word
that's coming out of your mouth.

424
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,193
I thought you said
that we were like family.

425
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:40,431
Well, I think that, too.
Shouldn't trust run both ways?

426
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:41,716
Cass, I just can't.

427
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,970
Dean, I do
everything that you ask.

428
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:48,339
I always
come when you call.

429
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,424
And I am your friend.

430
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:53,394
Still, despite
your lack of faith in me

431
00:22:53,478 --> 00:22:55,179
and now your threats...

432
00:22:56,932 --> 00:22:59,550
...I just saved you,
yet again.

433
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:02,570
Has anyone but your closest kin
has ever done more for you?

434
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:05,906
All I ask
is this one thing.

435
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:08,976
- Trust your plan to pop Purgatory?
- I've earned that, Dean.

436
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:17,284
I came to tell you
that I will find Lisa and Ben.

437
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:20,254
And I will
bring them back.

438
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:23,007
Stand behind me...

439
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:25,643
The <i>one</i> time I ask.

440
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,913
You're asking me
to stand down?

441
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:30,765
Dean --

442
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:32,049
That's the same

443
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,135
damn ransom note
that Crowley handed me.

444
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:35,252
You know that, right?

445
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:38,472
Well, no, thanks.

446
00:23:38,557 --> 00:23:40,307
I'll find them myself.

447
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:42,643
In fact, why don't you
go back to Crowley

448
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:45,146
and tell him that I said
you can both kiss my ass?

449
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:18,229
Bobby?

450
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:19,313
Ellie.

451
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:21,665
It's been a while.

452
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:25,019
Come in.

453
00:24:32,027 --> 00:24:34,945
So, how did you find me?

454
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:39,667
Well, we weren't together long,
Ellie, but, uh,

455
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:41,786
I know a thing or two
about you.

456
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:44,171
I know your safehouses.

457
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:48,175
And let me tell you --
this one ain't all that safe.

458
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,996
So, did you come here
just to, um, chat?

459
00:24:58,303 --> 00:24:59,837
I know what you are,
Ellie.

460
00:25:06,645 --> 00:25:10,147
You're not exactly
from Milwaukee, are you?

461
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:11,866
Not exactly.

462
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,452
And -- not that
I'd have minded,

463
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,489
but you kind of fibbed
about your age, too.

464
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,158
Just slightly.

465
00:25:22,527 --> 00:25:24,194
900 years.

466
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:27,481
Okay, so,
what's your game, then?

467
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:28,499
Game?

468
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,867
Yeah.
Why are you here?

469
00:25:29,918 --> 00:25:32,753
Eve came through and raised
all kinds of hell quickly.

470
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:35,639
You been here how long?
What's with the slow burn?

471
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:39,343
- Well, you know, we're not all alike.
- Monsters?

472
00:25:39,394 --> 00:25:41,712
Okay, if it makes you feel
better to call me that, fine.

473
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:43,147
You're from
freakin' Purgatory.

474
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:44,682
You never
thought to mention that

475
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:47,401
the whole time
you slept with me?

476
00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:52,056
I am what I am, Bobby.

477
00:25:52,123 --> 00:25:54,358
And I happen to be
a friend.

478
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:56,110
You want to explain
that to me?

479
00:25:56,194 --> 00:25:58,195
I didn't ask those idiots
to crack the door.

480
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:00,581
I just happened to be
the thing that fell through.

481
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:03,284
And let me tell you something --
you are lucky it was me.

482
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:05,619
You're saying
you're on our side?

483
00:26:05,704 --> 00:26:07,571
I'm on <i>my</i> side.
I happen to <i>like</i> it here.

484
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:09,239
I don't want to see
this place

485
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:10,908
turned into
some bloody wasteland.

486
00:26:12,076 --> 00:26:14,545
So you killed
H.P. Lovecraft.

487
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:17,181
Please. That guy
couldn't even write "hello."

488
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,136
I have spent 75 years
trying to keep Purgatory closed.

489
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,971
Why do you think
I gave Dean the sword?

490
00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:26,724
To stop Eve.

491
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:28,859
Hell, you guys were supposed
to kill the damn dragons!

492
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:29,944
Look.

493
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:33,480
This all comes down
to one Angel.

494
00:26:33,565 --> 00:26:36,283
He wants Purgatory,
and he's looking for you.

495
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,987
Well, thanks
for the heads up.

496
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:41,956
I know him, El.

497
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,658
He's gonna figure it out
one way or another.

498
00:26:44,726 --> 00:26:48,045
Now, the only way I can stop him
is to get ahead of him.

499
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:51,131
So I need to know
how you open the door.

500
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:52,616
No.

501
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:55,636
No, Bobby. It's too dangerous
for <i>anyone</i> to know.

502
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,388
If I found you...

503
00:26:57,455 --> 00:26:58,722
He ain't far behind.

504
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,976
At least
let me take you somewhere,

505
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,527
protect you.

506
00:27:05,981 --> 00:27:07,130
No.

507
00:27:07,182 --> 00:27:08,499
Thanks.

508
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:13,520
I have a couple other places
lined up. Don't worry.

509
00:27:13,605 --> 00:27:16,139
Bobby.

510
00:27:16,191 --> 00:27:17,307
You're just a man.

511
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,662
I'm better off
protecting myself.

512
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:34,091
Drinking
your feelings, Sam?

513
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:36,176
I thought that was
your brother's bag.

514
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:39,530
Stressful times.

515
00:27:39,598 --> 00:27:41,265
Well, we need to talk.

516
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:43,333
Why?

517
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:44,518
Because --

518
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:47,671
I know I'm gonna live
to regret this, but...

519
00:27:47,722 --> 00:27:49,974
I'm officially
on your team.

520
00:27:51,276 --> 00:27:52,509
You bastards.

521
00:27:54,062 --> 00:27:57,114
And we should
believe you why?

522
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:59,450
Would you believe I had
a shred of decency?

523
00:27:59,517 --> 00:28:00,484
No.

524
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:01,952
Oh, that hurts.

525
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:04,972
Okay, you're right.
It's survival.

526
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,308
You see,
I asked Cass some questions,

527
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:10,294
and I disliked
his answers.

528
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:11,879
He seems
awfully sure of himself

529
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:13,998
for a man who wants to swallow
a million nuclear reactors.

530
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:17,501
I mean, these things can get
a bit Chernobyl, you know.

531
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:21,388
So, voil?.

532
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:23,557
Consider me
your double agent.

533
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:26,677
Oh, and I took the liberty
of searching for your friends.

534
00:28:26,728 --> 00:28:28,762
Took a while --
Crowley's a clever one.

535
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:29,680
You found them?

536
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:32,232
The upside is yes.

537
00:28:32,317 --> 00:28:35,352
The downside is,
no, I can't get them for you.

538
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,570
Why not?

539
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:38,605
Because Crowley's
Angel-proofed

540
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:39,790
the whole
bloody building.

541
00:28:39,858 --> 00:28:41,575
I guess
he doesn't trust Cass.

542
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,560
Seems that marriage
is going swimmingly.

543
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:45,162
Okay, well,
get us as close as you can.

544
00:28:45,229 --> 00:28:45,846
Sure.

545
00:28:47,248 --> 00:28:48,899
But then
you're on your own.

546
00:28:56,791 --> 00:29:00,260
All right, boys,
this is where I get off.

547
00:29:00,345 --> 00:29:01,845
God be with you...

548
00:29:01,913 --> 00:29:03,263
Or what have you.

549
00:29:35,547 --> 00:29:37,164
All right, be careful.

550
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:33,897
Oh, Dean. Thank God.

551
00:31:33,948 --> 00:31:36,083
Still got to
get you out of here.

552
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:37,067
Okay.

553
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:41,038
Let's go.

554
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:42,456
The brat's
not going anywhere.

555
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:45,425
And neither am I.

556
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:54,282
Crowley thought
you might come.

557
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,170
So he had me jump
this hot little piece of ass

558
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,404
for insurance.

559
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:00,240
Can't go losing our leverage,
now, can we?

560
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:03,260
Ah! Another step...

561
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:06,079
...Free appendectomy.

562
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,300
You know, she's awake
in here -- your mom.

563
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:12,186
I can hear her
thinking.

564
00:32:12,253 --> 00:32:13,604
- Don't listen to her, Ben.
- What?

565
00:32:13,688 --> 00:32:15,755
I was just gonna tell him
that you're his real daddy.

566
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:20,978
Just kidding.

567
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:23,197
Who knows
who your real dad is, kid?

568
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:24,314
Your mom's a slut.

569
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,482
You shut your mouth!

570
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:27,434
Oh, what?
You're her white knight now?

571
00:32:27,485 --> 00:32:30,437
She wishes
she never met you, Dean.

572
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:32,772
You're the worst mistake
she ever made!

573
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:35,775
Well, second worst...

574
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:37,628
After keeping you.

575
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:39,546
That's not your mom, Ben.
She's lying.

576
00:32:39,614 --> 00:32:43,667
Says the C-minus lay
with 10 miles of mommy issues.

577
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:46,253
Whatever gets you through
the night, Tiny Tim.

578
00:32:46,304 --> 00:32:48,555
Ah-ah-ah.
Back off, cowboy.

579
00:32:48,623 --> 00:32:51,625
You know,
she's begging me to kill you.

580
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:53,060
She says
you hold her back.

581
00:32:54,795 --> 00:32:57,731
Never had a lick of fun
since you were born.

582
00:32:57,798 --> 00:32:59,733
Ben, look at me.
Look at me.

583
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,401
You're gonna be
just fine.

584
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:03,687
Aah!

585
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:04,804
Aah!

586
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:10,160
Ben, knife!

587
00:33:10,978 --> 00:33:12,812
What's the matter, Dean?
Hit me.

588
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:17,200
Oh, you don't want to hurt
poor Lisa?

589
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:20,654
<i>Exorcizamus te,</i>
<i>omnis immundus spiritus --</i>

590
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:21,705
Shut your mouth!

591

Stop it.

597
00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:42,776
I'm warning you.

598
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:44,177
You can go to hell,
you black-eyed bitch.

599
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,064
You sure about that?

600
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:49,399
Mom!

601
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:54,988
Exorcise me now...

602
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,857
She's just
a dead meatsuit.

603
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:00,661
Now, what was it
you wanted to say?

604
00:34:07,135 --> 00:34:08,752

<i>Audi nos.</i>

610
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,484
- Mom!
- Lisa!

611
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:25,268
Lisa.

612
00:34:27,438 --> 00:34:28,722
Here, put pressure
on that, okay?

613
00:34:28,773 --> 00:34:30,607
I know, honey. I know.

614
00:34:30,692 --> 00:34:34,244
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right.

615
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:36,196
It's Sam.
Leave me a message.

616
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:38,332
Sam, where are you,
damn it?!

617
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,033
All right, Ben. We got to
get her out of here, okay?

618
00:34:40,084 --> 00:34:41,001
Ben.

619
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:42,569
Ben?

620
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,620
Ben.

621
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:45,005
Hey!

622
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:46,757
Listen, man, I need you
to pull it together, okay?

623
00:34:46,841 --> 00:34:48,842
You got to be strong.
Your mom needs you right now.

624
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,345
Go over in that duffel bag.
Grab the salt gun.

625
00:34:51,412 --> 00:34:52,579
I got to carry
your mom out,

626
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,431
so if anything comes at us,
you shoot it.

627
00:34:54,515 --> 00:34:55,415
But --
go. Now.

628
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:03,089
Okay. Get the knife.
Get the knife.

629
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:06,943
All right, Ben.
Keep your elbow in,

630
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:09,229
gun tight to your shoulder,
and watch for the kick.

631
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:11,815
Ben!

632
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:17,537
Ben.

633
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:19,072
- Ben!
- Dean.

634
00:35:19,123 --> 00:35:20,657
Come on!
Pull it together!

635
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:22,376
You want your mom to die?!
Let's go.

636
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:39,393
Come on.

637
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,094
Dean!
Sam?

638
00:35:41,145 --> 00:35:42,646
In here!

639
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,736
Come on. We got to get
to a hospital.

640
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:51,438
Here.
Give the gun to him.

641
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:52,939
Sam, we need a ride.
Yeah.

642
00:36:01,032 --> 00:36:02,165
Go, go, go, go.

643
00:36:14,495 --> 00:36:15,712
She's fine, Ben.
She's fine.

644
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:17,881
She's gonna be just fine.
We're almost there.

645
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:19,216
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Stay with me.

646
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,667
Sam, you got to go
faster, man.

647
00:36:20,718 --> 00:36:23,186
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be just fine.

648
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:43,555
Ben, I'm sorry.

649
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:48,076
Ben.

650
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,512
What do you want?

651
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:56,985
Dean, listen.

652
00:36:57,036 --> 00:36:58,036
What do you want
me to say?

653
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:02,824
She'll be dead
by midnight.

654
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:04,109
I'm sorry.

655
00:37:04,177 --> 00:37:05,894
I don't care.

656
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:11,166
It's too little,
too late.

657
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:13,085
Okay.

658
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:16,888
Well, regardless,
I didn't come for you.

659
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:18,106
Meaning?

660
00:37:31,587 --> 00:37:34,206
She's fine now.

661
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:37,209
She'll wake soon.

662
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:44,366
Dean, I said I'm sorry,
and I meant it.

663
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:50,038
Thank you.

664
00:37:52,892 --> 00:37:55,577
I wish this changed
anything.

665
00:37:55,645 --> 00:37:57,596
I know.

666
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,897
So do I.

667
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:04,269
All else aside, I just wanted
to fix what I could.

668
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:08,740
There's one more thing
you could do for me.

669
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:20,118
Hey, mom.

670
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:21,370
Hey.

671
00:38:21,437 --> 00:38:22,921
What --

672
00:38:23,006 --> 00:38:25,457
You're in the hospital.

673
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:27,393
- What happened?
- We were in a car crash.

674
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:28,391
Are you okay?

675
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:29,683
Yeah, yeah.
I'm -- I'm fine.

676
00:38:30,145 --> 00:38:31,230
You hit your head
pretty bad,

677
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:33,227
but you're okay now.

678
00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:42,509
Hi.

679
00:38:46,697 --> 00:38:49,182
Who are you?

680
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:52,919
I-I'm Dean.

681
00:38:56,774 --> 00:38:58,875
Um...
I'm the guy who hit you.

682
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:02,662
Oh.

683
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,683
I just, uh...

684
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,604
I lost control for a minute.

685
00:39:10,688 --> 00:39:13,356
And I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

686
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,395
But I'm real happy
you two are both okay.

687
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:21,848
And, uh...

688
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:26,970
...I'm just -- I'm glad your
life can get back to normal now.

689
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:33,994
We're okay, so...

690
00:39:34,078 --> 00:39:36,963
So that's
what's important, right?

691
00:39:41,452 --> 00:39:43,220
Yeah.

692
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:47,290
Anyway, uh...

693
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:50,477
I'll leave you two alone.

694
00:39:53,814 --> 00:39:55,515
You take care
of your mom.

695
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,297
Well?

696
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:29,466
Well, nothing.

697
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:41,528
Dean, you know, you have pulled
some shady crap before,

698
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:44,431
but this has got to be
the worst.

699
00:40:44,498 --> 00:40:46,399
Whitewashing
their memories?

700
00:40:46,484 --> 00:40:48,752
Take it from somebody
who knows --

701
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:51,204
if you ever mention
Lisa or Ben to me again,

702
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:52,422
I will break your nose.

703
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:56,242
Dean --

704
00:40:56,327 --> 00:40:57,677
I'm not kidding.

705
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:57,160
Sam!

706
00:41:57,227 --> 00:41:59,996
? Carry on, my wayward son ?

707
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,331
You got to promise
not to try to bring me back.

708
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:05,701
? There'll be peace
when you are done ?

709
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:09,255
? lay your weary head to rest ?
Sammy?

710
00:42:09,323 --> 00:42:12,925
? Don't you cry no more ?

711
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,961
You're a hunter. Now you know
your brother's out there.

712
00:42:15,045 --> 00:42:16,245
I need you to go.

713
00:42:16,296 --> 00:42:18,264
It's Sam.
He's different.

714
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,684
It's his soul.
It's gone.

715
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:25,805
I'm going to go to hell
to fetch your brother's soul.

716
00:42:27,941 --> 00:42:29,425
I don't remember anything.

717
00:42:29,476 --> 00:42:33,062
? Once I rose
above the noise and confusion ?

718
00:42:33,113 --> 00:42:37,233
? just to get a glimpse
beyond this illusion ?

719
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:38,818
? I was soaring ever higher ?

720
00:42:38,902 --> 00:42:41,370
Finding Purgatory's
important to me --

721
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:45,441
an untapped oil well
of every fanged, clawed soul.

722
00:42:45,492 --> 00:42:47,710
Do you have any idea
what souls are worth?

723
00:42:47,777 --> 00:42:49,111
What power they hold?

724
00:42:49,162 --> 00:42:50,296
Raphael
and his followers,

725
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,381
they want him
to rule heaven.

726
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:55,501
The <i>last</i> thing we want
is to let him take over.

727
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:58,421
That little limey mook
roasted months ago.

728
00:42:58,472 --> 00:43:01,123
Crowley's alive.

729
00:43:01,174 --> 00:43:03,432
I want to discuss
a simple business transaction.

730
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:04,560
With me?

731
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:07,513
You and Crowley have been
going after Purgatory together?

732
00:43:07,598 --> 00:43:09,682
I can stop Raphael.

733
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:11,484
You have to trust me.

734
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:14,420
? Don't you cry no more ?

735
00:44:04,354 --> 00:44:07,456
We're closed.

736
00:44:07,524 --> 00:44:10,526
Just, uh --
just give me a second.

737
00:44:10,577 --> 00:44:12,378
Sorry, pal.
We -- we open at noon.

738
00:44:12,462 --> 00:44:14,880
Look,
you don't understand.

739
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:21,637
Okay, I-I think
I understand...just fine.

740
00:44:21,705 --> 00:44:23,038
Look, I-I don't need
this kind of hassle,

741
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,707
so, seriously,
just get the hell out.

742
00:44:24,758 --> 00:44:27,009
Please. Please, just give me
a minute to think, that's all.

743
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,513
Then I'm out of your hair.
One minute, please.

744
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,074
What's your name?

745
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:44,193
I don't know.

746
00:44:44,244 --> 00:44:46,696
What do you mean
you don't know?

747
00:44:46,747 --> 00:44:50,282
I mean I don't remember.
I don't remember anything.

750
00:45:04,503 --> 00:45:07,222
Come on.
You're dickin' with me.

751
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:08,090
Nothing?

752
00:45:08,118 --> 00:45:09,618
I'm telling you --
blank slate.

753
00:45:10,267 --> 00:45:11,985
Well, you got
a wallet, I.D.?

754
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:14,404
I wish I did.

755
00:45:14,488 --> 00:45:16,423
Okay, what's the last thing
you remember?

756
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,242
Um...

757
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:21,394
I woke up on a park bench,

758
00:45:21,445 --> 00:45:25,031
cops shoving a flashlight in
my face, trying to take me in.

759
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:27,751
- So you ran.
- No, I, um --

760
00:45:27,835 --> 00:45:30,620
I knocked them out cold,
both of them.

761
00:45:30,705 --> 00:45:32,539
No, look,
I didn't mean to.

762
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,457
It just happened really fast,
you know?

763
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:36,559
I-I think I-instinct
or something, I guess.

764
00:45:36,627 --> 00:45:38,962
Some instinct.
Yeah, tell me about it.

765
00:45:39,046 --> 00:45:40,747
I mean, who even knows
how to do something like that?

766
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:43,633
We'll get you to the E.R. the --
the quacks will hash it out.

767
00:45:43,718 --> 00:45:45,251
No.

768
00:45:45,302 --> 00:45:46,519
Try "yeah."

769
00:45:46,587 --> 00:45:48,121
Look, the bats
have flown the belfry.

770
00:45:48,189 --> 00:45:50,073
- You need to see a doctor.
- No, I...

771
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:56,429
I don't have time.

772
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,315
Time for what?

773
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,868
Look, it's hard to explain.

774
00:46:01,935 --> 00:46:04,937
I just feel like
I-I have to...be somewhere.

775
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:06,939
There's s-something
I got to stop.

776
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:09,876
Oh, like a wedding?
A train?

777
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:12,746
No, something important,
something like...

778
00:46:12,797 --> 00:46:14,831
- Life or death, like --
- Hey, hey, hey.

779
00:46:14,915 --> 00:46:16,383
Just relax.

780
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:20,837
Y-you can't poop it out.
So, just -- it'll come to you.

781
00:46:38,406 --> 00:46:40,306
What is it?

782
00:46:42,827 --> 00:46:44,577
You a horror fan?

783
00:46:44,645 --> 00:46:47,864
Yeah, um, I think so.

784
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:49,649
You know,
I <i>really</i> think so.

785
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,534
Something --
something about this.

786
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:54,821
Phillips ain't
his last name. It's Lovecraft.

787
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:00,376
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

788
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:02,612
Seriously,
we are taking you to a doctor.

789
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,514
Have you got a computer?

790
00:47:04,598 --> 00:47:06,099
What?

791
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:11,938
That's it. It exists.
Look -- two towns over.

792
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:14,023
- You think you're staying in this dump?
- Maybe.

793
00:47:14,108 --> 00:47:16,392
Maybe you're a hooker.

794
00:47:16,477 --> 00:47:18,027
I guess I'll find out.

795
00:47:18,112 --> 00:47:21,314
Look, um...

796
00:47:21,365 --> 00:47:23,850
I don't know how to say, uh --
thanks for everything.

797
00:47:23,901 --> 00:47:25,952
Where do you think
you're going?

798
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:27,570
I'll be fine.

799
00:47:27,655 --> 00:47:30,073
Says the head case that
just slumped over a minute ago.

800
00:47:30,157 --> 00:47:32,659
Look, is there any way I can
convince you to go to a hospital?

801
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,245
No.
Apparently, I'm stubborn.

802
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:36,796
Well...

803
00:47:36,864 --> 00:47:38,331
So am I.

804
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:41,084
I'm driving.

805
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:43,820
Look, that's really nice of you
but not necessary.

806
00:47:43,888 --> 00:47:45,349
Really? Okay, look,
your eggs are scrambled.

807
00:47:45,374 --> 00:47:46,574
But --

808
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,141
But nothing.

809
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:50,143
No, I mean,
I'm -- I'm just some guy.

810
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,229
I-I could be anybody.
You got to be nuts.

811
00:47:53,314 --> 00:47:55,014
I've been called that.

812
00:47:55,065 --> 00:47:56,649
Look, if I let you
go off alone,

813
00:47:56,717 --> 00:47:59,435
I won't be able to sleep
at night.

814
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,289
And, honestly, I'm dying to know
how it all turns out.

815
00:48:08,996 --> 00:48:11,698
So, uh,
where do we start?

816
00:48:11,749 --> 00:48:14,233
Uh, ground floor,
corner room...

817
00:48:14,285 --> 00:48:16,002
nearest
to the fire escape.

818
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:18,004
That's the one I'd pick --
quickest getaway.

819
00:48:18,071 --> 00:48:20,573
And why do you know that?

820
00:48:20,624 --> 00:48:23,793
I just do.

821
00:48:38,091 --> 00:48:40,226
Hey, you got
a credit card?

822
00:48:40,294 --> 00:48:41,861
Uh...

823
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:45,565
Why?
Are we, uh, checking in?

824
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:47,617
Sort of.

825
00:48:54,909 --> 00:48:56,626
Dude...

826
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,161
Who are you?

827
00:48:58,245 --> 00:49:00,380
Good question.

828
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:10,890
This all yours?

829
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:12,291
I don't know.

830
00:49:12,343 --> 00:49:15,595
I guess.

831
00:49:15,646 --> 00:49:17,564
Well, I love what you've done
with the place.

832
00:49:17,631 --> 00:49:22,151
It's very "Beautiful Mind"
meets..."Se7en."

833
00:49:22,236 --> 00:49:24,303
Sorry.
I talk when I'm nervous.

834
00:49:27,825 --> 00:49:30,743
Hey, well,
I guess we know your name.

835
00:49:30,811 --> 00:49:32,612
Nice to meet you,
Jimmy Page.

836
00:49:34,648 --> 00:49:38,034
And, uh, Neil Peart.

837
00:49:38,118 --> 00:49:40,503
And Angus Young.

838
00:49:40,588 --> 00:49:43,039
Okay, listen, no offense,

839
00:49:43,123 --> 00:49:45,375
but I'm...really starting
to freak out.

840
00:49:45,459 --> 00:49:46,876
You and me both.

841
00:49:58,389 --> 00:50:00,673
Where is she?

842
00:50:00,724 --> 00:50:03,109
She said to
meet her here.

843
00:50:03,176 --> 00:50:05,445
I'll try her again.

844
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,829
- Elle?
- Hey.

845
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,575
I guess I could have used
your help after all.

846
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,800
Just be still.

847
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:29,585
- What happened?
- They took me.

848
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:31,704
I got away.

849
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:33,973
Oh, Ellie.

850
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:35,258
Oh, what have they done
to you?

851
00:50:35,342 --> 00:50:37,894
Everything.

852
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:39,929
The demon I could have handled,
you know?

853
00:50:40,014 --> 00:50:42,582
But when
the Angel stepped in...

854
00:50:45,653 --> 00:50:48,104
I told him, Bobby.

855
00:50:48,188 --> 00:50:51,824
They have enough
to crack Purgatory wide open.

856
00:50:51,892 --> 00:50:54,494
Tell me.
I need to know.

857
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:58,230
They need virgin blood.
That's a milk run for them.

858
00:50:58,282 --> 00:51:02,035
And they need the blood
of a Purgatory native.

859
00:51:02,086 --> 00:51:04,671
Well, they've got
plenty of that now.

860
00:51:04,738 --> 00:51:05,905
Have they opened it
yet?

861
00:51:05,956 --> 00:51:08,658
Mnh-mnh. Tomorrow.

862
00:51:08,726 --> 00:51:11,744
The moon
and the eclipse.

863
00:51:11,795 --> 00:51:12,845
I'm sorry, Bobby.

864
00:51:12,913 --> 00:51:15,431
- No, it's okay.
- I'm sorry, really.

865
00:51:15,516 --> 00:51:17,416
Just tell us
where they are.

866
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:22,088
Elle?

867
00:51:31,431 --> 00:51:33,649
I'm sorry
this had to happen.

868
00:51:37,121 --> 00:51:38,488
Crowley got carried away.

869
00:51:38,572 --> 00:51:41,607
Yeah, I bet it was all Crowley,
you son of a bitch!

870
00:51:41,658 --> 00:51:43,493
You don't even see it,
do you?

871
00:51:43,577 --> 00:51:46,129
How totally off the rails
you are.

872
00:51:46,213 --> 00:51:47,380
Enough!

873
00:51:47,447 --> 00:51:48,831
I don't care
what you think.

874
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:51,551
I've tried to make you
understand. You won't listen.

875
00:51:51,618 --> 00:51:53,169
So let me make this
simple.

876
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:57,256
Please go home
and let me stop Raphael.

877
00:51:57,307 --> 00:51:59,142
I won't ask again.

878
00:51:59,226 --> 00:52:01,811
Well, good, 'cause I think
you already know the answer.

879
00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:07,333
I wish
it hadn't come to this.

880
00:52:08,936 --> 00:52:13,356
Well, rest assured,
when this is all over...

881
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,941
I will save Sam,

882
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:17,660
but only
if you stand down.

883
00:52:17,745 --> 00:52:18,978
Save Sam from what?

884
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:25,418
Hey, hey.
Are you okay?

885
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:28,320
Sam.

886
00:52:29,256 --> 00:52:31,374
My name is Sam.

887
00:52:34,545 --> 00:52:37,213
So, uh,
what do you remember?

888
00:52:37,297 --> 00:52:39,348
Well

889
00:52:39,433 --> 00:52:41,300
It might sound pretty strange
if I said it aloud.

890
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:44,003
Oh, it -- it couldn't get
any stranger.

891
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,858
Yeah?
Don't be so sure.

892
00:52:52,179 --> 00:52:53,846
Look, I-I don't know.

893
00:52:53,897 --> 00:52:55,731
I mean, it's all pretty spotty,
you know?

894
00:52:55,816 --> 00:52:59,735
I just remember I was --
I was with, uh -- with two guys.

895
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:03,689
One was, like,
a male-model type,

896
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,043
and the other was
an older guy named, uh...

897
00:53:07,127 --> 00:53:09,361
Bobby.

898
00:53:09,413 --> 00:53:13,182
Okay. Well,
what are you looking for?

899
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,220
Here. Bobby Singer.
That has to be it.

900
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:18,241
Is there a phone number?

901
00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:19,442
No, just an address.
Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

902
00:53:20,591 --> 00:53:21,841
South Dakota.

903
00:53:21,892 --> 00:53:24,894
Okay, uh...

904
00:53:24,978 --> 00:53:26,479
L-listen, Sam --

905
00:53:26,546 --> 00:53:28,481
- Sam, right?
- Yeah.

906
00:53:28,548 --> 00:53:30,344
Look, I'm really sorry,
but this is --

907
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:31,969
is where I got to get off.

908
00:53:32,052 --> 00:53:34,437
Oh, no. Of course.
No problem.

909
00:53:34,521 --> 00:53:37,356
Okay. Well, how are you
gonna get there?

910
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:45,615
I guess
I'll take my car.

911
00:53:52,506 --> 00:53:55,007
That's mine.

912
00:53:55,075 --> 00:53:56,259
Are you sure?

913
00:53:56,343 --> 00:53:57,593
Oh, yeah.

914
00:53:57,678 --> 00:53:59,045
Look, Sam,

915
00:53:59,096 --> 00:54:01,714
I don't feel right
about you going off like this.

916
00:54:01,765 --> 00:54:03,582
Oh, look, don't worry.

917
00:54:03,634 --> 00:54:06,802
Y-you've done way too much
for me already.

918
00:54:06,887 --> 00:54:08,304
That's not what I mean.

919
00:54:08,388 --> 00:54:09,805
What I mean is, uh...

920
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:12,091
I've got a bad feeling,
you know,

921
00:54:12,142 --> 00:54:15,111
with those I.D.s
and that shady-ass hotel room.

922
00:54:15,195 --> 00:54:17,280
Whatever
you're looking for --

923
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:19,565
you might not like
what you find.

924
00:54:21,268 --> 00:54:24,103
What other choice
do I have?

925
00:54:24,154 --> 00:54:26,489
You could stick around here
a little bit longer,

926
00:54:26,573 --> 00:54:28,074
get your head straight,

927
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:29,775
instead of going off,
flying blind into --

928
00:54:30,944 --> 00:54:33,496
What the hell was that?!

929
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,464
Stay down.

930
00:54:45,976 --> 00:54:47,894
Sam!

931
00:54:47,961 --> 00:54:49,295
Sammy. Sammy?!

932
00:54:51,231 --> 00:54:52,932
Sammy?

933
00:54:54,351 --> 00:54:57,303
Come on.
Snap out of it.

934
00:55:15,088 --> 00:55:18,207
? Well, you've got
your diamonds ?

935
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:20,376
? and you've got your... ?
Anything?

936
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,654
I can't just sit here, Bobby.
I've got to help him.

937
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:24,597
Dean.

938
00:55:24,598 --> 00:55:26,775
You know, "Dreamscape"
his noggin -- something.

939
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,333
You know what Cass did.

940
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:30,751
The dam inside
your brother's head is gone,

941
00:55:30,837 --> 00:55:32,675
and all hell's
spilling loose.

942
00:55:32,689 --> 00:55:34,637
- We don't know what's going on inside.
- I don't care.

943
00:55:34,725 --> 00:55:37,310
- We have got to do something!
- And we will.

944
00:55:37,361 --> 00:55:40,679
But right now, we got 16 hours
till they pop Purgatory.

945
00:55:40,731 --> 00:55:42,898
I'm down one man.

946
00:55:42,983 --> 00:55:44,483
I can't afford
to be down two.

947
00:55:44,534 --> 00:55:47,119
Yeah, and how's that going, huh?
We've got no line on Crowley.

948
00:55:47,187 --> 00:55:49,188
We got no line on Cass.
Balthazar's M.I.A.

949
00:55:49,239 --> 00:55:50,539
I mean, all we've got

950
00:55:50,624 --> 00:55:52,241
is Sam going through
whatever the hell this is!

951
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:53,626
You know...

952
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,547
...this is exactly
what Cass wants --

953
00:55:58,632 --> 00:56:00,883
for you
to fall to pieces.

954
00:56:00,968 --> 00:56:03,419
? ...Playing with fire ?

955
00:56:03,503 --> 00:56:06,339
Just try to think
of what Sam would want.

956
00:56:10,877 --> 00:56:13,179
Find Cass, Bobby.

957
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,847
Find him now.

958
00:56:14,898 --> 00:56:18,317
? Old man took her diamonds ?

959
00:56:18,385 --> 00:56:22,688
? and tiaras by the score ?

960
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:27,326
? now she gets her kicks
in stepney... ?

961
00:56:27,394 --> 00:56:28,744
Do you smell whiskey?

962
00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:30,613
Okay, Sam,
would you focus?

963
00:56:30,697 --> 00:56:33,199
Yeah. I'm sorry.

964
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,501
Okay, so, who shot at us?

965
00:56:35,568 --> 00:56:38,287
? ...'Cause you're playing with fire... ?
I-I didn't really get a good look.

966
00:56:38,372 --> 00:56:40,423
Okay, we got to go
to the cops.

967
00:56:40,507 --> 00:56:42,208
No. Look, if we can just get
to my friends,

968
00:56:42,259 --> 00:56:43,509
they can help us --
I know it.

969
00:56:43,576 --> 00:56:45,177
Okay, you don't know
if they're your friends, okay?

970
00:56:45,245 --> 00:56:47,263
You don't know anything
about anything.

971
00:56:47,347 --> 00:56:49,715
- Just turn around.
- No.

972
00:56:49,766 --> 00:56:53,252
- Look, you're safer with me.
- How do you know that?

973
00:56:53,303 --> 00:56:56,222
You're scaring me.

974
00:56:56,273 --> 00:56:57,723
? ...Mother ?

975
00:56:57,774 --> 00:57:01,394
? so don't play with me ?

976
00:57:01,445 --> 00:57:04,030
? 'cause you're playing
with fire ?

977
00:57:05,816 --> 00:57:09,819
? so don't play with me ?

978
00:57:09,903 --> 00:57:11,704
? 'cause you're playing
with fire ?

979
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:17,460
What? No way.

980
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:23,666
What was that?

981
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,918
What do you mean?
It's daylight.

982
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,137
Yeah?

983
00:57:28,221 --> 00:57:30,806
It was night,
and now it's day.

984
00:57:30,891 --> 00:57:33,392
It was <i>always</i> day.

985
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,845
No, no, no, no, no.
No, it wasn't. It --

986
00:57:35,929 --> 00:57:38,264
what the hell
is going on here?

987
00:57:38,315 --> 00:57:41,350
Okay, so I am all filled up
on crazy for today.

988
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:43,352
You know what, Sam?
I'll -- I'll see you.

989
00:57:43,437 --> 00:57:45,688
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey, hey.

990
00:57:49,142 --> 00:57:51,243
Get in the car.

991
00:58:09,996 --> 00:58:12,014
Wow.

992
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,771
My God.

993
00:59:08,855 --> 00:59:12,024
Am I
really that gawky?

994
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:14,410
Howdy.

995
00:59:16,029 --> 00:59:17,363
This is impossible.

996
00:59:17,414 --> 00:59:20,332
Cold. Try again.

997
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,035
I'm, uh --
I'm hallucinating.

998
00:59:23,086 --> 00:59:24,453
Warmer.

999
00:59:24,538 --> 00:59:26,738
But see, normally,

1000
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:29,625
you're awake
when you're tripping balls.

1001
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:31,510
I'm dreaming?

1002
00:59:31,578 --> 00:59:35,214
And someone just won a copy
of the home game.

1003
00:59:35,265 --> 00:59:37,016
We're inside
your grapefruit, Sam.

1004
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:40,636
Son...
You've been juiced.

1005
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,422
I-I-I don't remember
anything.

1006
00:59:43,473 --> 00:59:46,225
Well, your B.F.F. Cass brought
the hell wall tumbling down,

1007
00:59:46,276 --> 00:59:49,428
and you, pathetic infant
that you are,

1008
00:59:49,479 --> 00:59:51,730
shattered into pieces.

1009
00:59:51,781 --> 00:59:54,617
Piece...Piece.

1010
00:59:54,701 --> 00:59:57,319
I-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1011
00:59:57,404 --> 00:59:58,821
Why would you?

1012
00:59:58,905 --> 01:00:01,407
You're jello, pal,
unlike me.

1013
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:03,942
What are you?

1014
01:00:03,994 --> 01:00:05,327
I'm not handicapped.

1015
01:00:05,412 --> 01:00:08,163
I'm not saddled
with a soul.

1016
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:12,268
In fact, I used to skipper
this meatboat for a while.

1017
01:00:12,335 --> 01:00:17,456
It was smooth sailing.
I was sharp, strong.

1018
01:00:17,507 --> 01:00:20,626
That is, till they crammed
your soul back in.

1019
01:00:20,677 --> 01:00:22,794
Now look at you.

1020
01:00:22,846 --> 01:00:26,148
Same misty-eyed milksop
you always were.

1021
01:00:26,233 --> 01:00:29,351
That's because
souls are weak.

1022
01:00:29,436 --> 01:00:31,186
They're a liability.

1023
01:00:32,572 --> 01:00:36,492
Now, nothing personal,
but run the numbers.

1024
01:00:36,576 --> 01:00:40,246
Someone's got to take charge
around here

1025
01:00:40,313 --> 01:00:41,647
before it's too late.

1026
01:01:01,718 --> 01:01:03,385
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1027
01:02:09,252 --> 01:02:11,570
You think <i>I'm</i> bad?

1028
01:02:13,123 --> 01:02:14,840
Wait till you meet
the other one.

1029
01:02:29,556 --> 01:02:31,089
Hey! Sam!

1030
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,711
I remember who I am --

1031
01:02:52,779 --> 01:02:56,448
everything I did
this past year.

1032
01:02:56,499 --> 01:02:59,168
And I remember you.

1033
01:03:03,807 --> 01:03:06,725
Walk away,
or the girl dies.

1034
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:15,567
There goes your leverage.

1035
01:03:22,742 --> 01:03:25,160
Didn't I tell you
to turn back,

1036
01:03:25,245 --> 01:03:26,695
that you wouldn't like
what you found?

1037
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:29,198
I'm sorry.

1038
01:03:29,282 --> 01:03:31,366
I'm so sorry.

1039
01:03:31,451 --> 01:03:33,919
Not as sorry
as you're gonna be.

1040
01:03:47,934 --> 01:03:51,169
Look what the cat
dragged in.

1041
01:03:51,221 --> 01:03:54,273
Well,
at least you mudfish

1042
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,775
finally got
the angel-proofing right.

1043
01:03:56,843 --> 01:03:58,009
How's sleeping beauty?

1044
01:03:58,061 --> 01:04:00,863
You didn't steal any kisses,
I trust?

1045
01:04:00,947 --> 01:04:03,899
What the hell
took you so long?

1046
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:05,818
Honestly?

1047
01:04:05,869 --> 01:04:07,402
I was having
second thoughts.

1048
01:04:07,487 --> 01:04:08,821
About?

1049
01:04:08,872 --> 01:04:10,706
About
whether to help you.

1050
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:12,357
I was thinking maybe --

1051
01:04:12,408 --> 01:04:15,544
maybe I should rip out
your sticky bits instead.

1052
01:04:15,612 --> 01:04:17,162
And what
did you decide?

1053
01:04:19,332 --> 01:04:20,415
Well...

1054
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:26,488
...Cass and Crowley
are there.

1055
01:04:26,556 --> 01:04:29,475
That's where
the show gets started.

1056
01:04:32,262 --> 01:04:35,097
All right, well, give us a minute
to pack up and then zap us there.

1057
01:04:35,181 --> 01:04:36,849
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so.

1058
01:04:36,856 --> 01:04:37,794
Balthazar.

1059
01:04:37,795 --> 01:04:39,388
I'm betraying
a friend here --

1060
01:04:39,853 --> 01:04:41,236
a very powerful friend.

1061
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:43,388
We all are.

1062
01:04:43,439 --> 01:04:46,625
So I think I've stuck
my neck out far enough already.

1063
01:04:48,728 --> 01:04:50,028
Good luck.

1064
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,345
Your Purgatory
power shake, monsieur --

1065
01:05:06,412 --> 01:05:09,848
half monster,
half virgin.

1066
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:14,686
Thank you.

1067
01:05:18,257 --> 01:05:21,310
You seem even more constipated
than usual.

1068
01:05:21,394 --> 01:05:23,362
Maybe get you
some colon blow?

1069
01:05:23,429 --> 01:05:25,898
I'm renegotiating
our terms.

1070
01:05:25,949 --> 01:05:29,434
Is that so?
What terms do you propose?

1071
01:05:29,502 --> 01:05:31,269
You get nothing.

1072
01:05:32,705 --> 01:05:34,790
Not one single soul.

1073
01:05:34,874 --> 01:05:37,209
Can't help notice --

1074
01:05:37,276 --> 01:05:39,261
seems a bit...
unfairly weighted.

1075
01:05:42,782 --> 01:05:46,785
Castiel...
you wouldn't dare.

1076
01:05:46,836 --> 01:05:49,638
I brought you
this deal.

1077
01:05:49,722 --> 01:05:53,291
You think I'm handing
all that power...

1078
01:05:53,343 --> 01:05:55,244
to the King of Hell?

1079
01:05:55,311 --> 01:05:57,946
I'm neither
stupid nor wicked.

1080
01:05:58,014 --> 01:06:00,065
Unbelievable.

1081
01:06:00,132 --> 01:06:02,801
Have you forgotten that you're
the bottom in this relationship?

1082
01:06:02,852 --> 01:06:04,019
Here are your options.

1083
01:06:04,103 --> 01:06:06,605
You either flee,
or you die.

1084
01:06:06,656 --> 01:06:08,991
We made a pact.

1085
01:06:09,075 --> 01:06:12,027
Even <i>I</i> don't break contracts
like this.

1086
01:06:12,111 --> 01:06:14,145
Flee...

1087
01:06:14,197 --> 01:06:15,664
or die.

1088
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:21,219
Boy, you can't trust anyone
these days.

1089
01:07:02,312 --> 01:07:03,679
Hey.

1090
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:08,016
Hey!

1091
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:13,922
Oh.

1092
01:07:14,007 --> 01:07:16,642
Hi, Sam.

1093
01:07:19,896 --> 01:07:21,680
So?

1094
01:07:21,731 --> 01:07:23,165
Which one are you?

1095
01:07:26,052 --> 01:07:27,519
Don't you know?

1096
01:07:36,112 --> 01:07:37,746
I'm the one
that remembers Hell.

1097
01:07:55,825 --> 01:07:58,744
Time's up, Dean.

1098
01:07:58,797 --> 01:08:00,414
Just a second.

1099
01:08:08,089 --> 01:08:10,674
All right, this is
where we're gonna be, Sam.

1100
01:08:12,977 --> 01:08:15,763
So you get your lazy ass
out of bed and come meet us.

1101
01:08:18,316 --> 01:08:20,350
Sammy, please.

1102
01:08:33,981 --> 01:08:35,682
I wish you hadn't come,
Sam.

1103
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,719
I had to.
I'm here, right?

1104
01:08:38,787 --> 01:08:41,588
Out there in the real world,
I'm at Bobby's, aren't I?

1105
01:08:41,656 --> 01:08:44,091
How do you know?

1106
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,492
This whole time,

1107
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,078
I smell nothing
but old spice and whiskey.

1108
01:08:48,146 --> 01:08:50,848
I figured
if I could get back here,

1109
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:53,450
back to my body,
I could...

1110
01:08:53,518 --> 01:08:56,854
I don't know --
I could snap out of it somehow.

1111
01:08:56,921 --> 01:08:59,490
First, you have to
go through me.

1112
01:08:59,557 --> 01:09:01,308
Why?

1113
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,278
Humpty-dumpty has to put himself
back together again

1114
01:09:04,345 --> 01:09:06,980
before he can wake up.

1115
01:09:07,031 --> 01:09:08,816
And I'm the last piece.

1116
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:12,703
Which means...

1117
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:15,873
...I have to know
what you know...

1118
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:20,410
...What happened in the cage.
Trust me.

1119
01:09:22,247 --> 01:09:23,764
You don't
want to know it.

1120
01:09:27,836 --> 01:09:30,470
You're right.

1121
01:09:30,538 --> 01:09:32,739
But I still have to.

1122
01:09:32,807 --> 01:09:34,641
Sam...
you can't imagine.

1123
01:09:34,709 --> 01:09:37,895
Stay here, go back,

1124
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:41,565
find that bartender,
go find Jess, but don't do this.

1125
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:43,884
I know you.

1126
01:09:43,935 --> 01:09:45,853
You're not strong enough.

1127
01:09:48,656 --> 01:09:50,490
We'll just have to see.

1128
01:09:52,193 --> 01:09:54,361
Why is this so important
to you?

1129
01:09:56,447 --> 01:09:57,614
You know me.

1130
01:09:57,682 --> 01:09:59,900
You know why.

1131
01:09:59,951 --> 01:10:02,169
I'm not leaving my brother alone
out there.

1132
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:16,350
I'm not gonna fight you.

1133
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:17,851
But this
is your last chance.

1134
01:10:31,098 --> 01:10:32,482
Good luck.

1135
01:10:33,785 --> 01:10:36,603
You're gonna need it.

1136
01:11:12,857 --> 01:11:15,242
You rang, Cass?

1137
01:11:15,309 --> 01:11:17,110
Yeah.
We have a problem.

1138
01:11:17,161 --> 01:11:19,496
Dean Winchester
is on his way here.

1139
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:22,115
Really? Oh. How'd he even
know where we were?

1140
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:26,119
Apparently...
We have a Judas in our midst.

1141
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:28,455
Ah.

1142
01:11:28,506 --> 01:11:30,007
Holy hell.

1143
01:11:30,074 --> 01:11:32,259
Who is it?

1144
01:11:32,326 --> 01:11:36,013
I bet it's that
bloody little cherub, isn't it?

1145
01:11:39,217 --> 01:11:41,969
I don't know.

1146
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:43,637
But I-I need you
to find out.

1147
01:11:43,688 --> 01:11:46,056
Of course.
Um, right away, right away.

1148
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,629
Uh, but what do you
want me to do about Dean?

1149
01:11:47,654 --> 01:11:48,675
Nothing.

1150
01:11:48,676 --> 01:11:51,812
I'll handle him myself.

1151
01:11:54,348 --> 01:11:56,199
Castiel?

1152
01:11:56,284 --> 01:12:00,020
Are you all right?

1153
01:12:00,071 --> 01:12:02,222
First Sam and Dean,
and now this.

1154
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:07,661
I'm doing my best
in impossible circumstances.

1155
01:12:07,712 --> 01:12:11,131
My friends -- they...

1156
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:13,583
abandon me...

1157
01:12:13,668 --> 01:12:15,635
plot against me.

1158
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:19,890
It's difficult
to understand.

1159
01:12:19,974 --> 01:12:23,927
Well, you --
you always got little old me.

1160
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:32,652
Yes.
I'll always have you.

1161
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,354
Cass...

1162
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:15,529
I count a dozen mooks,
probably more.

1163
01:13:15,596 --> 01:13:17,764
Demons?

1164
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,701
Angels.

1165
01:13:21,769 --> 01:13:24,621
Well, how the hell are we
gonna take out that many Angels?

1166
01:13:24,705 --> 01:13:28,158
We don't.
We'll ninja our way in.

1167
01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:31,144
Awesome, yeah --
till they hear your knee squeak.

1168
01:13:31,212 --> 01:13:32,412
Shut up.

1169
01:13:32,463 --> 01:13:34,114
Oh, what,
now you got thin skin?

1170
01:13:34,165 --> 01:13:35,916
No, shut up.

1171
01:13:35,967 --> 01:13:37,100
You hear that?

1172
01:13:45,426 --> 01:13:48,395
What the hell is that?

1173
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:53,817
T. Rex, maybe?

1174
01:13:57,271 --> 01:13:59,990
Holy mother of...

1175
01:14:03,277 --> 01:14:04,528
Get to the car.
Get to the car.

1176
01:14:30,771 --> 01:14:34,307
Never underestimate
the King of Hell, darling.

1177
01:14:34,358 --> 01:14:37,978
I know
a lot of swell tricks.

1178
01:14:38,029 --> 01:14:42,983
Now, I think it's time
to re-renegotiate our terms.

1179
01:14:47,354 --> 01:14:50,323
Sweaty hands, mate.

1180
01:14:50,374 --> 01:14:51,992
I don't understand.

1181
01:14:52,043 --> 01:14:53,877
You can palm me
all you want.

1182
01:14:53,961 --> 01:14:56,746
I'm safe and sound under
the wing of my new partner.

1183
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,668
Hello, Castiel.

1184
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:05,172
Raphael.

1185
01:15:14,563 --> 01:15:16,077
Consorting with Demons.

1186
01:15:16,413 --> 01:15:17,613
I thought that was beneath you?

1187
01:15:17,851 --> 01:15:19,919
Heard <i>you</i> were doing it.

1188
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:21,587
Sounded like fun.

1189
01:15:21,638 --> 01:15:22,605
You know, Castiel,

1190
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:24,724
y-you said all sorts
of shameful,

1191
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:28,427
appalling, scatological
things about Raphael.

1192
01:15:28,478 --> 01:15:32,231
I found him -- her --

1193
01:15:32,282 --> 01:15:34,617
to be really...
quite reasonable.

1194
01:15:34,701 --> 01:15:36,085
You fool.

1195
01:15:36,153 --> 01:15:39,539
Raphael will deceive and destroy
you at the speed of thought.

1196
01:15:39,606 --> 01:15:41,874
Right, right, 'cause
you're such a straight shooter.

1197
01:15:41,942 --> 01:15:44,076
She -- he --

1198
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:45,912
has offered me protection
against all comers.

1199
01:15:45,963 --> 01:15:48,497
In exchange for what?

1200
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:50,533
The Purgatory blood.

1201
01:15:53,453 --> 01:15:57,256
Castiel, you really think
I would let you open that door?

1202
01:15:57,307 --> 01:16:00,459
Take in
<i>that</i> much power?

1203
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:05,130
If anyone is going to be
the new God, it's me.

1204
01:16:07,133 --> 01:16:09,268
He's gonna bring
the Apocalypse and worse.

1205
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:11,136
Hey, this is your doing,
mate.

1206
01:16:11,188 --> 01:16:13,940
I'm merely grabbing
the best offer on the table.

1207
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:18,744
Now,
you have two options.

1208
01:16:18,812 --> 01:16:20,947
Flee or die.

1209
01:16:46,556 --> 01:16:51,644
<i>Ianua magna purgatorii,</i>

1210
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:55,314
<i>clausa est ob nos,</i>

1211
01:16:55,365 --> 01:17:01,120
<i>lumine eius</i>
<i>ab oculis nostris retento.</i>

1212
01:17:01,187 --> 01:17:04,073
Bobby.

1213
01:17:04,141 --> 01:17:07,009
Bobby?

1214
01:17:07,077 --> 01:17:09,045
Huh?

1215
01:17:09,129 --> 01:17:11,080
Come on.
We got to go.

1216
01:17:11,148 --> 01:17:16,368
<i>Sed nunc stamus</i>
<i>ad limen huius ianuae magnae</i>

1217
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:19,055
<i>et demisse, fideliter,</i>

1218
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:24,510
<i>perhonorifice,</i>
<i>paramus aperire eam.</i>

1219
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:27,596
<i>Creaturae terrificae,</i>

01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:31,851
<i>quarum ungulae et dentes,</i>

1221
01:17:31,902 --> 01:17:35,988
<i>nunquam tetigerunt</i>
<i>carnem humanam.</i>

1222
01:17:51,288 --> 01:17:52,905
Bit busy, gentlemen.

1223
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:56,425
Be with you in a moment.

1224
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:22,601
<i>Aperit fauces</i>
<i>eius ad mundum nostrum, nunc,</i>

1225
01:18:22,652 --> 01:18:25,871
<i>ianua magna aperta tandem!</i>

1226
01:18:33,797 --> 01:18:36,716
Mm-hmm.

1227
01:18:36,783 --> 01:18:39,118
Maybe I said it wrong.

1228
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:42,972
You said it perfectly.

1229
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:44,924
But what you needed
was this.

1230
01:19:03,643 --> 01:19:05,995
I see.

1231
01:19:11,785 --> 01:19:14,870
And we've
been working with...

1232
01:19:14,955 --> 01:19:17,089
Dog blood.
Naturally.

1233
01:19:17,157 --> 01:19:19,775
Enough
of these games, Castiel.

1234
01:19:19,843 --> 01:19:21,927
Give us the blood.

1235
01:19:21,995 --> 01:19:23,328
You --

1236
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:25,347
game's over.

1237
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:28,768
His jar's empty.

1238
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:34,190
So, Castiel,
how'd your ritual go?

1239
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:36,609
Better than ours,
I'll bet.

1240
01:20:05,026 --> 01:20:07,828
You can't imagine
what it's like.

1241
01:20:07,896 --> 01:20:09,580
They're all inside me --

1242
01:20:09,664 --> 01:20:13,501
millions
upon millions of souls.

1243
01:20:13,568 --> 01:20:15,085
Sounds sexy.

1244
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:18,539
Exit stage Crowley.

1245
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:22,710
Now, what's the matter,
Raphael?

1246
01:20:22,761 --> 01:20:24,762
Somebody clip your wings?

1247
01:20:24,846 --> 01:20:26,130
Castiel, please.

1248
01:20:26,214 --> 01:20:29,750
You let the Demon go...
but not your own brother?

1249
01:20:29,801 --> 01:20:31,719
The Demon I have plans for.

1250
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:33,888
You, on the other hand...

1251
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:49,987
So, you see...

1252
01:20:50,071 --> 01:20:52,122
I saved you.

1253
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:57,077
You sure did, Cass.
Thank you.

1254
01:20:58,547 --> 01:21:00,798
You doubted me...

1255
01:21:00,882 --> 01:21:03,116
fought against me.

1256
01:21:06,154 --> 01:21:08,105
But I was right
all along.

1257
01:21:08,173 --> 01:21:11,041
Okay, Cass, you were.
We're sorry.

1258
01:21:12,711 --> 01:21:15,412
Let's just defuse you,
okay?

1259
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,448
What do you mean?

1260
01:21:19,484 --> 01:21:22,686
You're full of nuke.
It's not safe.

1261
01:21:22,771 --> 01:21:24,071
So before the eclipse ends,

1262
01:21:24,138 --> 01:21:27,808
let's get them souls
back to where they belong.

1263
01:21:27,859 --> 01:21:29,159
Oh, no.
They belong with me.

1264
01:21:29,227 --> 01:21:31,779
No, Cass, I-it's
scrambling your brain.

1265
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:32,963
No, I'm not finished yet.

1266
01:21:33,031 --> 01:21:35,199
Raphael had many followers,

1267
01:21:35,267 --> 01:21:38,168
and I must...

1268
01:21:38,236 --> 01:21:40,087
Punish them all severely.

1269
01:21:42,707 --> 01:21:44,825
Listen to me.

1270
01:21:44,876 --> 01:21:47,878
Listen...

1271
01:21:47,963 --> 01:21:52,433
I know there's a lot
of bad water under the bridge.

1272
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,302
But we were family once.

1273
01:21:55,353 --> 01:21:57,638
I'd have died for you.

1274
01:21:57,689 --> 01:22:00,507
I almost did a few times.

1275
01:22:00,558 --> 01:22:02,326
So if that means anything
to you...

1276
01:22:05,814 --> 01:22:06,697
Please.

1277
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:11,869
I've lost Lisa,
I've lost Ben,

1278
01:22:11,936 --> 01:22:13,687
and now I've lost Sam.

1279
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:17,474
Don't make me lose you,
too.

1280
01:22:20,528 --> 01:22:23,213
You don't need this kind
of juice anymore, Cass.

1281
01:22:23,298 --> 01:22:26,700
Get rid of it
before it kills us all.

1282
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:31,805
You're just saying that
because I won...

1283
01:22:31,873 --> 01:22:33,540
Because you're afraid.

1284
01:22:36,561 --> 01:22:39,847
You're not my family,
Dean.

1285
01:22:39,898 --> 01:22:42,066
I have no family.

1286
01:22:57,165 --> 01:23:00,000
I'm glad you made it, Sam.

1287
01:23:02,704 --> 01:23:06,256
But the Angel blade
won't work,

1288
01:23:06,341 --> 01:23:08,842
because I'm not an Angel
anymore.

1289
01:23:12,881 --> 01:23:14,348
I'm your new God.

1290
01:23:15,767 --> 01:23:17,417
A better one.

1291
01:23:17,469 --> 01:23:21,438
So you will bow down

1292
01:23:21,506 --> 01:23:25,776
and profess your love unto me,
your Lord...

1293
01:23:27,929 --> 01:23:30,948
...or I shall destroy you.

1294
01:23:40,029 --> 01:23:44,029
