1
00:00:03,842 --> 00:00:05,226
You finally had a family.

2
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,223
And you were <i>building</i> something.

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,825
And it's as close to happiness

4
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:10,276
as I've ever seen a hunter get.

5
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:12,228
Dean?

6
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,780
- Ben, just stay there.
- I thought I heard you...

7
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:14,998
I said stay back!

8
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,369
Ben won't even talk about it.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,838
This is the worst time
in the universe to talk.

10
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:23,123
Can we do this later?

11
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:26,009
You shoved my kid, Dean.
How about we do this now?

12
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:28,344
- But you and Ben...
- Me and Ben can't be in this with you.

13
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:32,915
Lucifer's cage.
Sam's soul is stuck in that box.

14
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:34,305
Nasty, those memories.

15
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:37,181
You don't want to know
what they'll do to him.

16
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:40,601
- Don't do his.
- Don't scratch the wall.

17
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:45,389
Death didn't just shove
your soul back in, okay?

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,325
He put up the great wall of Sam

19
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:49,360
between you and the things
that you don't remember.

20
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:53,062
And trust me when I say that
the things you don't know could kill you.

21
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:55,616
Sammy?

22
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,702
Sammy?!

23
00:00:57,753 --> 00:00:59,537
Sammy, talk to me!

24
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:12,248
Sam?

25
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:16,270
Sam.

26
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:18,922
S... Sam?

27
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:24,028
Oh, come on.

28
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26,980
Sammy!

29
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:29,483
Come on, come on.

30
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:34,788
Come on, damn it.

31
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:44,131
Hey, hey, hey, you with me?

32
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:48,586
Okay.

33
00:01:48,637 --> 00:01:52,605
Come on. Come on,
got to get you out of here.

34
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:57,071
What the...

35
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:08,466
Who's there?!

36
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:39,172
Season 6 Episode 14
"Mannequin 3: The Reckoning"

37
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:02,252
How you feel?

38
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:05,188
Like I got hit by a... planet.

39
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:08,525
Well, lucky for you,
I'm a doctor.

40
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:10,811
I got Joe, grub, and...

41
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:13,563
What are they?

42
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:14,898
Effective.

43
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:18,818
I'm okay. Thanks.

44
00:04:18,936 --> 00:04:20,120
Suit yourself.

45
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,074
So, how long was I out, again?

46
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,077
I'm telling you,
like two or three minutes.

47
00:04:27,128 --> 00:04:28,778
Why, what'd it feel like to you?

48
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,665
About a week, give or take.

49
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:36,219
You want to talk about it?

50
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:39,306
"It"?

51
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,724
Yeah, whatever that was.

52
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,909
I mean, it was like
you were freakin' electrocuted.

53
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:52,903
Look I mean,
it wasn't <i>fun,</i>

54
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,971
but I... I'm... fine.

55
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,823
Fine.

56
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:01,978
It was Hell, wasn't it?

57
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,914
You got a big, fat
faceful of Hell.

58
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:06,483
Ever cross your mind
that you could've died?

59
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:08,318
- Oh, come on.
- I'm serious.

60
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,587
And none of this
"it's just a flesh wound" crap.

61
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:12,172
'Cause we did it your way.

62
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:13,656
We let you go explore,

63
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,959
and every bad thing that
I said would happen happened.

64
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,594
So guess what...

65
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:18,862
past stays past.

66
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,597
We're not
kicking that wall again.

67
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:22,165
So I'm supposed to
just ignore it?

68
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:23,100
Yes.

69
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:25,519
Dean...

70
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:27,670
I might've done...

71
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:29,723
who knows what,

72
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:31,358
and you want me
to just <i>forget</i> about it?

73
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:34,111
You shove it down,
and you let it come out

74
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:36,396
in spurts of violence
and alcoholism.

75
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:37,781
That sounds healthy.

76
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:39,032
Well, works for me.

77
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:43,653
It's not a joke.

78
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:46,039
Your life
is on the line here, Sam.

79
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:48,642
This is not a debate.

80
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:51,745
I mean, first you were
a... a soulless dick-bag,

81
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,063
and now you're not.

82
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:56,882
So we good?

83
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,887
Yeah. Sure.

84
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,341
Good.

85
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,319
Well, let's get your mind
off it, shall we?

86
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,206
You, uh, up for a job?

87
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,490
Well, what do you got?

88
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,459
Janitor murdered
in a college lab last night.

89
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,945
Doors were locked, nobody else
in or out of the building.

90
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,464
Great. Where to?

91
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:23,916
Paterson, New Jersey.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,051
Hey, maybe we'll have
a Snooki sighting.

93
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,337
What's a Snooki?

94
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,590
That is a good question.

95
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,879
Check it out.
This thing's friggin' <i>awesome!</i>

96
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,853
Be my Valentine.

97
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,888
Dude, we're working.
Put it back.

98
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,106
- Have a heart.
- Dean!

99
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:50,409
Buzz kill.

100
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,278
You smell sulfur?

101
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,896
Yeah, we're in a science lab.

102
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,699
Right.

103
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,337
Who is it?

104
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,595
So, Lisa?

105
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,180
Maybe you should
mind your own business.

106
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:14,082
What's wrong with just
talking to her, Dean?

107
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,551
Thanks, Dr. Laura.
That's... that's very insightful.

108
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,103
Look at that...
our time's up.

109
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,156
Hey.

110
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,560
Whoa. Ghosts gone wild.

111
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,895
Something's up in here.

112
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,217
Question is, what?

113
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:38,302
Sam, good news.

114
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:39,964
Big Brother's watching.

115
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,313
Hey.

116
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,282
So, what'd you find out from the,
uh, mop jockey's girlfriend?

117
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,500
Nothing.

118
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,835
Just how great he was...
went to church,

119
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,654
donated to charity,
rubbed her feet during "Glee."

120
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,373
I just threw up in my mouth.

121
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,159
Sorry. Anyway, I checked
his record... spotless.

122
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,595
What about the science building?
Anything?

123
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:35,964
Built in '05.
Nothing weird about the land.

124
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,383
Before this, the biggest mishap
was some genius

125
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:41,019
accidentally spilled
sulfuric acid on his crotch.

126
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,971
They don't even dissect
anything good in there.

127
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,390
Anything bigger than Kermit,
they use an iPad.

128
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,843
So we got nothing?

129
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,746
Yeah,
a big steaming pile of it.

130
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,770
Hello?

131
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:33,155
Who's there?!

132
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,362
Jonny?!

133
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:45,066
Is that you?!

134
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,126
Okay.

135
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,844
Ha ha, very funny.

136
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,021
What the hell?

137
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,067
Oh!

138
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:58,967
- You got it?
- Yep!

139
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:09,917
- I'm backing up.
- Yeah.

140
00:11:35,677 --> 00:11:36,978
Dean?

141
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,249
Yeah?

142
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:42,850
This thing's humming.

143
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,769
Hmm.

144
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:47,054
Wait.

145
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:50,191
That anatomy dummy you were
molesting at the lab.

146
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,359
Excuse me?

147
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,494
What if that's what
this is about?

148
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:55,863
What exactly
are you accusing me of?

149
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,164
I don't mean that.

150
00:11:57,232 --> 00:11:58,950
I mean, there was
an anatomy dummy there,

151
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,285
and here...

152
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,005
You're joking.

153
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:06,374
You're not joking.

154
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,792
Okay, uh, so, what,

155
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:11,045
we've got... we've got
a bunch of killer dolls

156
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:13,347
like... Chucky?

157
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:15,433
I mean, come on,
that's... that's just...

158
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:18,719
friggin' creepy.

159
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,889
I mean, if ghosts
can possess humans

160
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,591
and... and move objects,
why can't they possess this?

161
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,880
I suppose.

162
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,381
But riddle me this, bat boy...

163
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:32,051
ghosts aren't exactly known
for hopping county lines, right?

164
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,202
True.

165
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,838
This one hits up a college

166
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,257
and now a factory,
what, three towns over?

167
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,425
Doesn't add up.

168
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,395
So we dig.

169
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,232
Over there.

170
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,655
I don't like the way
Kim Cattrall's lookin' at me.

171
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:03,248
Well, this dead guy's as squeaky clean
as the last dead guy.

172
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,118
I can't find a speck of dirt
on him. You?

173
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,503
Nothing.

174
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,923
Hmm.

175
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,541
Well, here's a speck.

176
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:18,681
Uh, seamstress named Rose Brown
went missing over a year ago.

177
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:20,415
Uh, cops just gave up on her.

178
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,752
Last seen at the factory,
presumed dead.

179
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,472
Survived by sister Isabel.

180
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,525
50 bucks...
vengeful spirit.

181
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,893
Pay sis a visit?

182
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:34,229
All right.

183
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,154
Answer it.

184
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,215
Lisa?

185
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,333
Finally.

186
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,834
I've been calling.

187
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,619
Ben?

188
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,021
- What are you...
- Something's wrong with mom.

189
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,892
What are you talking about?

190
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,795
- It's bad, Dean.
- Define "bad."

191
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,098
I... I don't know.
S... she won't talk to me.

192
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,983
- All right, put her on the phone.
- She won't <i>come</i> to the phone.

193
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:15,804
Ben, get your mom
and put her on the phone.

194
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,773
I... I... I can't.
Her door's locked.

195
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:19,358
She barely gets out of bed.

196
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,976
I'm not kidding.

197
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,878
Please just...
just come help me.

198
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,479
I... I don't know what to do.

199
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,331
All right,
let me call you back.

200
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,100
- Dean...
- Five minutes.

201
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,655
Come on, man,
I... I can't just leave.

202
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:34,923
Dude, you <i>got</i> to leave.

203
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,126
Yeah, but we're talking
life or death here.

204
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,294
Right. I can handle it
for 24 hours, Dean.

205
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,163
I get you want to bury it.

206
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,132
But I had to deal with my past year.
You got to deal with yours.

207
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,967
Oh, yeah, and that worked
so great for you.

208
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,635
Come on.

209
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:53,559
So, you and Rose
were close, huh?

210
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,693
Very.

211
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:56,979
Our parents died
when we were little,

212
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,564
so we had each other.

213
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:00,282
What was she like?

214
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:02,901
Um, kind...

215
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,870
giving.

216
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:08,157
She had the biggest heart.

217
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,959
But people gave her a hard time.

218
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:11,977
How come?

219
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,330
She was shy, a little awkward.

220
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,200
I guess that made her
an easy target.

221
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,252
I feel like I've been
defending her my whole life.

222
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,920
I'm sure she appreciated it.

223
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:25,574
Well, it went both ways.

224
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:28,427
She did more for me
than anybody else ever could.

225
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,763
I just miss her.

226
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,268
Um, may I?

227
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,686
Sure. Please.

228
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,830
Oh, it's a company Christmas
party a couple years back.

229
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,750
Wait, you work
at Salzman & Sons, too?

230
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:55,287
Well, everybody works
at the factory, yeah.

231
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,756
That's Rose.

232
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,100
Dean, hey, get this.

233
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:09,751
That college janitor?

234
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,971
He worked at the factory, too,
until last year.

235
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,307
Apparently, he quit right after
Rose's disappearance.

236
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,060
So fair bet something happened
to that girl around that factory,

237
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,928
so let's call that joint
ground zero.

238
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,613
Right, but it still
doesn't explain

239
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:24,266
how a ghost ended up
at a college in another zip code.

240
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,901
It's not like
she hopped the blue line.

241
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,152
I'm headed to the factory now.

242
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,787
I'll call when I get
the whole scoop on Rose.

243
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,307
So, how long have you been here
with the company?

244
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,309
I've been here
about three years now.

245
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,565
I'm sorry, w... what's this
got to do with me?

246
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,069
Relax.
Just a routine questioning.

247
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:02,804
Oh. Okay.

248
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,257
Uh, did you know Rose Brown?

249
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,694
Uh...

250
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,195
Maybe.

251
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:15,017
Uh, the name
sounds kind of familiar.

252
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,372
She was a seamstress here.

253
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,257
She went missing
about a year ago.

254
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:24,293
Here.

255
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,627
You mind taking a look?

256
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:31,466
Uh, yeah, I s...
I saw her around.

257
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,539
Anything you can tell me
about her that might help?

258
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:43,011
Look, I'd love to help,

259
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,430
but I don't know anything.

260
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,200
And, uh, I'm about to be
late back from break, so...

261
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:49,484
You seem nervous, Jonny.

262
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,824
Well

263
00:17:55,875 --> 00:18:00,078
those guys that died
were my friends.

264
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,964
O... of course
I'm gonna be upset.

265
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:04,765
I didn't say upset.
I said nervous.

266
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,339
Here.

267
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:15,177
In case you remember anything.

268
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:41,036
Dean, what are you doing here?

269
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,423
Well, you look absolutely fine.

270
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:46,792
What's going on?

271
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:51,246
We've been "parent trapped."

272
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,331
What?

273
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,799
Ben sent out a 911.

274
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,350
Why would he do that?

275
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:57,052
You're going on a date, huh?

276
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,507
Come in.

277
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,152
You want to sit down?

278
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,154
Not so much.

279
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,741
So, who's the guy?

280
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,081
"Who's the guy?"

281
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,134
His name is Matt.

282
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:30,335
He's a doctor.

283
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,738
Oh, Dr. Matt.

284
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,423
How respectable.

285
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,308
Really? That's how
this is gonna be?

286
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,146
Look, I... I...

287
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,764
I called you <i>six</i> times, Dean.

288
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,132
And I almost called
you back about 100.

289
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,183
Good to know.

290
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,651
Lis, Ben called me.

291
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:48,520
I dropped everything and ran.

292
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,405
If you want to know
if I care...

293
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:51,406
Doesn't help me.

294
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:52,711
What do you want from me?

295
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:54,062
I'm not asking for anything.

296
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,164
Well, then <i>ask</i> for something!

297
00:19:57,684 --> 00:19:59,467
Um...

298
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,402
- Go to your room!
- Go to your room!

299
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:17,002
You know, I... I can't...

300
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,705
ask for something.

301
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,592
I know what I want.

302
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:25,260
But I can't have it...

303
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:28,496
not how you live.

304
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:32,634
My phone rings, I think...
tiny chance it's you,

305
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:35,637
big chance it's Sam calling
to tell me you're dead.

306
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:37,806
- Lis...
- No, don't.

307
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:42,527
Don't apologize or anything.

308
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:45,030
It's just...

309
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:47,182
It's just I get to this place
where I'm okay,

310
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:48,850
and then you show up
at our door.

311
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:50,485
You keep doing that,

312
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:53,839
every time I think
I'm never gonna see you again.

313
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:56,458
I'm trying to get over you.

314
00:20:58,244 --> 00:20:59,745
What are you trying to do?

315
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:03,765
What do you want
from <i>us,</i> Dean?

316
00:21:22,051 --> 00:21:24,903
<i>Why</i> am I flipping out?!

317
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:27,022
I... I don't know,
maybe 'cause of the feds!

318
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:30,024
Maybe 'cause Dave and Steve
are freaking dead.

319
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,062
Look... no. No.

320
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:35,781
Just... call me later.

321
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:08,122
Come on.

322
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:13,761
What's going on?

323
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:19,184
That was a ghost trying
to kill you for being a dick.

324
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:20,018
What?

325
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,304
You know what?

326
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:25,507
You're lucky you are
the most suspicious interview

327
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:26,775
of all time.

328
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:29,810
I figured something like this
would happen.

329
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:31,529
Figured something like <i>what</i>
<i>would happen?</i>

330
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:33,865
Buddy, look, I don't have time
for the big speech, all right?

331
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:35,950
So, brass tacks...

332
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:37,218
Rose is back.

333
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:39,120
That's crazy!

334
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:41,206
Look, you're gonna end up
like your friends

335
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,324
unless you tell me
what you did to Rose.

336
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:49,230
Do you want me
to help you or not?

337
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:56,688
It was just a stupid joke.

338
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:59,224
You know, I mean, you...
you... you play jokes.

339
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:01,259
We didn't think
it was that big of a deal.

340
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:05,630
What did you do?

341
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:11,402
We made Rose think
she had a secret admirer.

342
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,252
I don't think the girl had ever
been asked out in her life.

343
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:30,889
Honestly, we just thought
she was kind of pathetic...

344
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:39,647
so we knew
she'd take the bait.

345
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:55,697
She was so excited.

346
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:04,454
The poor girl
never saw it coming.

347
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:22,023
Look, Rose,
I think he likes you.

348
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:25,026
It was mean.

349
00:24:25,093 --> 00:24:27,278
But you know how it is when
a group of guys get together.

350
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:28,479
They... they act like jackasses.

351
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:32,266
Aw, don't be like that.

352
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:34,935
Come on, Rosey,
it's just a joke!

353
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:41,125
Go to hell.

354
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,994
It happened so fast...

355
00:24:43,078 --> 00:24:45,780
Hey, take a joke, Rosey.

356
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:47,065
Seriously.

357
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,642
We didn't mean
for it to happen.

358
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:02,146
And then it was too late.

359
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,104
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the cops.

360
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:12,223
- Are you crazy?
- It was an accident.

361
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,575
We tricked her here.
I grabbed her.

362
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:16,611
That's involuntary
manslaughter at least,

363
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:18,196
and <i>that's</i> if they even
believe us.

364
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,947
You understand?

365
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:22,700
Steve said there was
only one option.

366
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:30,124
I wish I could
take it all back.

367
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:31,592
I'm sure you do.

368
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,211
I didn't kill her.

369
00:25:33,295 --> 00:25:34,629
Okay.

370
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,880
Look me in the eyes

371
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:38,515
and tell me
none of it's on you.

372
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,473
Look, I'm not saying
you deserve to die.

373
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:48,443
I can help you.

374
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,694
How?

375
00:25:49,778 --> 00:25:52,179
You have to tell me
where she's buried.

376
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:54,449
In the woods,

377
00:25:54,516 --> 00:25:56,300
a clearing off Canyon Run Road.

378
00:25:58,654 --> 00:26:00,272
- No, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere.
- But I...

379
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,828
you need to stay inside the salt line
until I tell you you're safe.

380
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:08,411
You just want me
to stand here all night?!

381
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:10,895
Consider it getting off easy.

382
00:26:27,662 --> 00:26:29,129
Well, that's ridiculous.

383
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:30,714
Plants could never
kill a zombie.

384
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,133
You think
I'm gonna say "I'm sorry"?

385
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:34,752
And why would I think that?

386
00:26:34,836 --> 00:26:36,554
Because you lied
to get me here?

387
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,255
It was an emergency.

388
00:26:38,323 --> 00:26:40,707
A date's not an emergency, Ben.

389
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:43,043
It is if it's the third one.

390
00:26:43,094 --> 00:26:45,262
I watch TV.
I know what that means.

391
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:02,997
Well, your mom's a grown-up.

392
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:04,949
She gets to go out.

393
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,667
Why won't you come home?

394
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:09,503
Can't you just say "I'm sorry"
and then come back?

395
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:12,923
I'm sorry. I can't.

396
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:15,574
- Can't or won't?
- Both.

397
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,128
- So, you hate mom now?
- What? No, come on.

398
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:20,130
- So it's me.
- Ben, stop it.

399
00:27:20,215 --> 00:27:21,599
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

400
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,351
Listen to me.

401
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,186
You didn't do <i>anything.</i>

402
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:28,305
You understand that?

403
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:34,428
Look, one day you'll, uh...

404
00:27:34,496 --> 00:27:36,113
you'll get this
when you're older.

405
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,898
Don't talk to me like I'm six.

406
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:41,485
Okay, fine.

407
00:27:45,106 --> 00:27:48,292
It's like this, then.

408
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,744
Just 'cause you love someone

409
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:54,882
doesn't mean you should stick around
and screw up their life.

410
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:57,401
So I can't be here.

411
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:59,803
You think something
will follow you home?

412
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,259
No.

413
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,646
No, I don't, but I think my job
turns me into somebody

414
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,347
that can't sit
at your dinner table.

415
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:12,632
And if I stayed,

416
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:15,102
you'd end up just like me.

417
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:19,823
Why do you say it
like you're so... bad?

418
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,527
Well, trust me, I'm not someone
you want to aim to be.

419
00:28:23,611 --> 00:28:26,245
- Don't I get a vote?
- No, you don't.

420
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:28,782
I'm sorry, Ben.

421
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,501
But, you see,
this way you got a shot

422
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:32,169
at living
whatever life you want.

423
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,238
You know, pick one.

424
00:28:34,305 --> 00:28:36,507
Pick five.

425
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:40,461
'Cause with me,
there's just the one road.

426
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,963
- You're a liar, Dean.
- Excuse me?

427
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,598
You say family's so important,

428
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:47,167
but... but what do you call
people who... who care for you,

429
00:28:47,218 --> 00:28:50,554
who love you
even when you're a dick?

430
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:52,923
You know you're walking out
on your family, right?

431
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:33,063
All right, it's over.
You're safe.

432
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:34,214
And, Jonny?

433
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:36,900
Look at this
as a new beginning.

434
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,570
Lot of chances
not to be a jackass.

435
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,369
Jenny?

436
00:31:19,454 --> 00:31:22,840
Hon... we're leaving...

437
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,158
Tonight.

438
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,161
So, pack up.
Just the essentials.

439
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:36,103
All I want is for us
to move on with our lives.

440
00:31:36,171 --> 00:31:38,055
I love you.

441
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:40,407
You know that.

442
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:43,477
It's been...

443
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:45,729
it's been really hard, Jen.

444
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:25,675
This is Dean's
other, other cell,

445
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,176
so you must know what to do.

446
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:28,311
Hey, it's not over.

447
00:32:28,362 --> 00:32:30,280
Burning the remains
didn't stop her.

448
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:32,515
She's got to be
hooked to something else.

449
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:34,317
I'm gonna head
to the sister's now.

450
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:36,518
Call me.

451
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,446
So, um, this is it?

452
00:32:46,514 --> 00:32:50,333
I gave most of her clothes
to the Goodwill.

453
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:52,252
She didn't have much.

454
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,337
Those yours?

455
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:56,056
Yeah.

456
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,141
- Are you in school?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

457
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,909
- Where?
- Uh, Great Falls.

458
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:07,484
So let me guess...

459
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:13,056
Um, you were at the chem lab
and the factory this week.

460
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:15,962
Well, yeah.

461
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:23,249
Did you happen to stop by a bar
called McOwen's last night?

462
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,585
Everybody from the factory
goes there.

463
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,756
I stop in
maybe three times a week.

464
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,624
Why?

465
00:33:34,261 --> 00:33:37,013
That's it.

466
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,382
- So this is all about <i>you.</i>
- <i>What? What is?</i>

467
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,353
The murders... your co-workers,
your college janitor.

468
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:45,346
What, you... you think
<i>I could do something like that?!</i>

469
00:33:45,394 --> 00:33:46,454
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

470
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:48,085
But... but I think
you're at the center.

471
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,061
Me? How?

472
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,429
What are you wearing of Rose's?
A ring? A bracelet?

473
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:55,815
- Her baby teeth in a locket? What?
- You're scaring me.

474
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,784
Just think, please.

475
00:33:56,798 --> 00:33:59,882
- What... what do you have of Rose
that you carry with you? - I... I'm...

476
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:03,156
What?

477
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:07,911
Well, the only thing I have
of hers is a part of me.

478
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,831
When I was 16, she gave me
one of her kidneys.

479
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:15,200
- Her kidney?
- Yeah.

480
00:34:15,285 --> 00:34:16,469
You're kidding.

481
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,021
Will you please tell me
what this is about?

482
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,640
Yeah. Um...

483
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,909
But I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

484
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,207
So, that the girl
with the haunted kidney?

485
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:43,987
Yeah.

486
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:45,621
Well, just when you think
you seen it all.

487
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:47,875
What do you want to do?

488
00:34:47,943 --> 00:34:49,077
Can't exactly burn the thing.

489
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:49,913
I mean, she kind of needs it.

490
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,267
Well, she can't just
walk around with it, Dean.

491
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:52,263
The spirit's attached.

492
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,618
It's gonna use her to get close
to anyone it wants revenge on.

493
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:56,132
It's not gonna stop killing.

494
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:57,725
Okay, so what are you suggesting,
that we cut it out of her?

495
00:34:57,793 --> 00:34:59,143
And then what?

496
00:34:59,228 --> 00:35:02,263
Leave her in a tub of ice
with a phone taped to her hand?

497
00:35:02,314 --> 00:35:03,631
Maybe we should
call Dr. Robert.

498
00:35:03,682 --> 00:35:04,982
Might have some leads on some

499
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:06,634
non-haunted, black-market
replacement kidneys.

500
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:08,319
He works out of a butcher shop.

501
00:35:08,404 --> 00:35:10,321
It's pretty clean.
You'd be surprised.

502
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:11,989
No. I think
we have to go hoodoo.

503
00:35:12,074 --> 00:35:14,409
- Hoodoo?
- Yeah.

504
00:35:14,476 --> 00:35:16,077
That's more of a band-aid,
not really a cure.

505
00:35:16,144 --> 00:35:17,328
It buys us a minute.

506
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:18,996
All right, Louisiana it is.

507
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:20,748
Voodoo?!

508
00:35:20,816 --> 00:35:23,167
What the hell
are you talking about?

509
00:35:23,252 --> 00:35:24,335
Actually, it's "hoodoo."

510
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,653
It's a little different.

511
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:27,622
- Hold on, Isabel.
- You're not Feds.

512
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:29,924
Just let us explain.

513
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:32,093
No.

514
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,212
No way.

515
00:35:34,296 --> 00:35:35,296
That's impossible.

516
00:35:35,347 --> 00:35:38,516
No, no, no, no, no, no.

517
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,052
She possesses sex dolls!
This... this is not a sex doll!

518
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:44,889
Hey, you leave my baby alone!

519
00:35:44,973 --> 00:35:45,990
She's got
nothing to do with this!

520
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:49,477
Go, go, go, go, go!

521
00:35:51,613 --> 00:35:53,815
Okay, here, here, here.
Get in.

522
00:36:08,923 --> 00:36:11,123
Son of a bitch!

523
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:17,871
I'm so sorry, baby.

524
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,018
Okay.

525
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:33,688
You all right?

526
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:35,189
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
You guys?

527
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,440
Yeah.

528
00:36:37,893 --> 00:36:40,060
Yeah, I'm...

529
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:47,618
Isabel?

530
00:36:47,703 --> 00:36:49,537
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

531
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:13,637
I'm sorry.

532
00:37:13,905 --> 00:37:16,690
I didn't mean for this.

533
00:37:51,223 --> 00:37:53,224
How's it look?

534
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,812
Well, considering she got
carjacked by poltergeist,

535
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,848
could be worse.

536
00:38:01,317 --> 00:38:04,185
I mean, what exactly
did we do back there, Sam?

537
00:38:06,706 --> 00:38:09,274
Yeah, I'm not putting it
in the win column, either.

538
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:10,859
We saved a few dicks,

539
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,977
a... a... and we killed
an innocent girl.

540
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:17,082
I got a heartbroken kid

541
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,918
and a woman
who's so pissed at me...

542
00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:22,403
I see what you mean
about facing your past.

543
00:38:22,455 --> 00:38:23,905
It's, uh...

544
00:38:23,956 --> 00:38:26,024
- It's awesome. Thanks.
- Dean.

545
00:38:26,092 --> 00:38:28,727
- I mean, all we do is make a mess.
- That's not true.

546
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,389
We do save lives,
now and again.

547
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,126
Yeah, I guess.

548
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:38,461
I'm just...

549
00:38:38,512 --> 00:38:40,513
I'm just tired
of all the bad luck, you know?

550
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:42,298
Well, you know, number one,

551
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,935
bad luck is kind of
in the job description.

552
00:38:45,002 --> 00:38:46,903
And two, it's not all bad.

553
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:48,405
Really. Look at me.

554
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:50,974
I mean, at least
Satan's left the building.

555
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:53,276
Yeah.

556
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:55,828
It's the little things.

557
00:38:57,114 --> 00:39:00,617
And I have a soul
because of you.

558
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:03,002
I never thanked you
for that, did I?

559
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:04,871
Ah, it's all good, man.

560
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:06,839
Well, thanks.

561
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:09,325
You'd have done
the same for me.

562
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:11,460
I mean it.

563
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:16,833
Look, we keep our heads down,
keep swinging.

564
00:39:16,884 --> 00:39:20,136
We'll lose some.
Hopefully, we'll win more.

565
00:39:20,187 --> 00:39:22,505
And...

566
00:39:22,556 --> 00:39:24,140
I don't know.

567
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:27,527
Anyway, for what it's worth,

568
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:28,678
I got your back.

569
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:32,949
Yeah, I know.
