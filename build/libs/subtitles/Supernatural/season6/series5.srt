1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,940
You turned me.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,940
Hate those fangs.

3
00:00:04,974 --> 00:00:05,874
You bit me
in the neck.

4
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,016
The bite
doesn't matter.

5
00:00:07,116 --> 00:00:09,566
You have to actually ingest
the blood to be infected.

6
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,176
That was vampire blood
he dosed you with.

7
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:11,804
What?

8
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:13,723
Lights are too bright?
Sunshine hurt your skin?

9
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,142
I get so hungry.

10
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:18,376
What have you been doing?

11
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,676
Hunting --
with some other people.

12
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,263
You?
Working with strangers?

13
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:22,515
More like family.

14
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:23,816
I'm your grandfather.

15
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,151
Stick around,
I'll show you tricks

16
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,352
your daddy
never even dreamed of.

17
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:29,572
I-I can't just
lose you and Ben.

18
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:33,576
Me and Ben will be here,
and...You come when you can.

19
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:34,810
Just come in one piece.

20
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:37,697
Are you okay?

21
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:39,448
Yeah, I'm great.

22
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:40,833
'Cause there's been a few times
that you've got me wondering.

23
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:44,086
It's Sam, Bobby.
He's just -- he's different.

24
00:00:44,154 --> 00:00:46,422
Something's not right to me.

25
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:59,057
? White on white,
translucent black capes ?

26
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,177
? back on the rack ?

27
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:10,071
? Bela Lugosi's dead ?

28
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:12,907
? the bats have left
the bell tower ?

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,343
? the victims have been bled ?

30
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:20,215
? red velvet
lines the black box ?

31
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:24,085
? Bela Lugosi's dead ?

32
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:37,915
? Bela Lugosi's dead ?

33
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:43,751
? undead, undead, undead ?

34
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:48,523
You came.

35
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,058
I told you I would.

36
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:54,896
? Undead, undead, undead ?
Shall we sit?

37
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,767
I can't tell you that.

38
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,935
Too embarrassing.

39
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,120
Come on.

40
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:06,441
Nothing you could
ever say would...

41
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:09,327
I mean,
those poems you posted?

42
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:12,447
They revealed
who you really are.

43
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,384
I know you, Kristen.

44
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,121
Thanks.

45
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:22,057
I actually, um...

46
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:23,958
Wrote one today.
You want to...?

47
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,093
Of course I do.

48
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:31,266
Ow. Damn it.

49
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:39,691
Paper cut.

50
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:41,476
Hi,
clumsiest person ever.

51
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:47,815
I have to go.

52
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,119
Wait!

53
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:12,424
Hi.

54
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,476
Hi.

55
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,564
I shouldn't be here.

56
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:21,332
So why are you?

57
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:30,992
I can't stop
thinking about you.

58
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:34,329
Then...

59
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:35,696
Don't.

60
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:39,167
We can't do this.

61
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,419
We <i>can't</i> be together.

62
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:42,587
- There has to be a way.
- No.

63
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:47,475
You think you know me...

64
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:48,927
But you don't.

65
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:55,600
I've done bad things.

66
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:57,235
You should run.

67
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,886
Now.

68
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,939
I can make
my own decisions.

69
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,223
I'm 17.

70
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:12,083
I have to
show you something.

71
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:17,338
Okay.

72
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,684
I knew it.

73
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:31,803
- Are you scared?
- No.

74
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:33,921
You should be.

75
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,191
I'm just scared...

76
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:38,977
I'm dreaming and I'll wake up
in math class.

77
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,268
Is it gonna hurt?

78
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:51,906
I could <i>never</i> hurt you.

79
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:54,659
Come with me.

80
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,778
Where?

81
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,497
Let me show you <i>my</i> world.

82
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:08,339
So, your place...

83
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:11,626
Is there gonna be...
Velvet?

84
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:13,628
Yeah, sure.

85
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,630
This is it?

86
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:19,967
But...
It smells like pee.

87
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,823
Nice work, Robbie.

88
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,608
Robert,
what's happening?

89
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,777
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

90
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,036
<font color=#ffff00>? Supernatural 6x05 ?</font>

92
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:48,579
Hey.

93
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:51,698
So, uh,
I'm actually not far.

94
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,083
I'm about
a night's drive.

95
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:56,203
Yeah?
So, you think...

96
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:58,288
Well, there's some stuff
I got to do here first.

97
00:05:58,373 --> 00:05:59,590
Of course.

98
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:01,875
But I was thinking that,
uh, I'll wrap up here

99
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:05,045
and, you know, make sure
I'm not followed.

100
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:06,280
I'll have to
take side streets,

101
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:07,464
and I'd have to
come at night --

102
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:10,134
will you just shut up
and get your ass home?

103
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:14,054
I can't wait to see you.
This phone thing's getting old.

104
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:16,223
Yeah.

105
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:19,860
Well,
call us when you're close.

106
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:21,979
And be careful.

107
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:23,897
Of course.

108
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:27,117
Hey.

109
00:06:27,202 --> 00:06:29,153
What are you
so stoked about?

110
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:31,488
What? Nothing.
What do you got?

111
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:34,908
Six girls in seven days,
which is more disappearances

112
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,960
than this city has seen
in over a year.

113
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:38,078
All about the same age.

114
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,279
And cute.

115
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:42,583
Hey, ice cream
comes in lots of flavors, Sam.

116
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:43,717
Gotcha.

117
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:45,419
Yeah, well,
half a dozen girls,

118
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,504
late teens,
a shower away from greatness.

119
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:49,289
Sounds like a profile.

120
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,058
Wonder what else
they got in common.

121
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,143
Well, six directions
to go, here.

122
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:54,428
Pick a number.

123
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,514
Seven. Another call
just came in today.

124
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:07,991
Kristen's a good kid --
a little naive, sure.

125
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:09,693
You try
and be a good parent.

126
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:12,812
Girls are hard.

127
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,917
Right. Well, we'd just like
to find your daughter.

128
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,754
Last door on the left.

129
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:22,539
Thanks.

130
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:28,929
What do you think
he was talking about?

131
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:30,497
Drugs?

132
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:44,361
Oh,
it is so much worse.

133
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:47,164
Vampires?

134
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:50,767
These aren't vampires, man.
These --

135
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:52,953
these are douchebags.

136
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,288
Yeah.

137
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:56,456
Wow.

138
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:59,526
Hmm.

139
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:06,583
Aha!

140
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:08,085
All right.

141
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:09,887
Let's see
what we can see.

142
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:15,859
All right.

143
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:21,064
That -- that's just...
Uncomfortable.

144
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:22,599
What is
he so bummed out about?

145
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:30,724
Look at this.

146
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:33,410
He's watching her sleep.
How is that not rapey?

147
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:35,779
I got to concentrate here,
Dean.

148
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:43,503
"He could hear the blood
rushing inside her,

149
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:44,871
"almost taste it.

150
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,957
"He tried desperately
to control himself.

151
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,926
Romero knew their love
was impossible."

152
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,377
<i>Romero?</i> Really?

153
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:51,845
Dean. Shut up.

154
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:53,797
This is
a national bestseller.

155
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,883
How is that <i>possible?</i>

156
00:08:58,052 --> 00:08:59,919
Hey, try, um...
"Lautner."

157
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:04,024
Wait. He's a werewolf.

158
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,776
How do you even know
who that is?

159
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,477
What, are you kidding me?
That kid's everywhere.

160
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:09,229
It's a freaking nightmare.

161
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:12,532
Hey, how many t's are there
in Pattin--

162
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,036
That's it. We're in.

163
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:17,070
Ha!

164
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:19,489
All right.

165
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:21,158
Well?

166
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:22,376
Well, her in-box is full

167
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:24,494
from some guy
claiming to be a vampire.

168
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:27,280
A <i>real</i> vampire?
Well, uh...

169
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:28,749
"I can only
meet you at night.

170
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,584
"I don't trust myself
with you.

171
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:32,636
The call of your blood
is too strong."

172
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,588
Vampires phishing
for victims?

173
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,174
Probably just
a human mouth-breather, right?

174
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:40,260
On the other hand,
talk about easy prey.

175
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:41,795
For actual vamps.

176
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:42,929
Yeah,
I mean, these chicks

177
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,097
are just throwing themselves
at you.

178
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,515
All you got to do is...

179
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,068
I don't know.
Write bad poetry.

180
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:49,403
Huh.

181
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,905
Well, this guy
wanted to meet her

182
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:54,691
at a place called
the Black Rose.

183
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:56,076
Give me a break.

184
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:57,444
I'm just
reporting the news.

185
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:59,913
It's probably just
your standard-issue perv, right?

186
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,000
Stop!

187
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,437
Let me go!

188
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,100
Okay. So now you're sure
it's vampires.

189
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:53,888
<i>100%?</i>
<i>Definitely.</i>

190
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,323
We got a pattern now --

191
00:10:55,374 --> 00:10:57,742
kids go missing,
blood-bank van gets jumped.

192
00:10:57,826 --> 00:10:59,377
This is the fourth town.

193
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:01,412
Clincher is,
this last hit --

194
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:04,531
driver was found,
throat ripped out.

195
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,801
Okay, they grab kids --
that's food, right?

196
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:08,052
But if they already got

197
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:09,420
a bunch of walking,
talking juice bars,

198
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,005
why bother
with the blood mobile?

199
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:12,256
It doesn't add up.

200
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:14,976
Find the nest.
Figure it out.

201
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:21,682
Well, you wanted emo chicks.
I think we hit ground zero.

202
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:26,237
Thank you.

203
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:28,222
Think she wears all that rubber
at the beach?

204
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:39,400
When's the last time
we had a beer together, anyway?

205
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:41,736
There.

206
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:44,789
What do you think?

207
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:46,240
He's hitting on her
hard enough.

208
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:48,175
Real?

209
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:50,077
I don't know,
it's hard to tell.

210
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:54,098
And we got multiple choice.

211
00:11:57,686 --> 00:12:00,855
Great.
Three of them, two of us.

212
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:04,859
? Well, he wants you ?

213
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:08,529
? and she wants him ?

214
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:13,401
okay,
make that two of them.

215
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,207
One's on the move.

216
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:26,047
All right, you go with Efron.
I got Bieber.

217
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:31,145
Are you sure, baby?

218
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:34,899
Are you ready
to join me in eternity?

219
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:37,034
Oh, my God, totally.

220
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:41,989
Go! Get out of here!

221
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:45,292
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Open your mouth!

222
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:47,461
Take those out.

223
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:48,662
Take 'em out!

224
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:51,966
Ohh.

225
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,867
For the love of...
What are you, 12?

226
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:57,088
Are you wearing glitter?

227
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:59,039
I only do it
to get laid, man!

228
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:00,874
Does it work?

229
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,645
I'll be damned.

230
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:06,713
All right,
"mmmbop" your way out of here.

231
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:09,049
Go! Go.

232
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:10,484
And use a condom.

233
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:20,361
You're pretty.

234
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,029
I'm sorry?

235
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,531
I said...

236
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:25,416
"You're pretty."

237
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,452
Yeah.
Sorry again, pal.

238
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:29,703
I don't
play for your team.

239
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:26,960
No!

240
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:47,414
Sammy.

241
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:58,708
Oh, my God,
what is that <i>sound?</i>

242
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:00,988
What sound, Dean?

243
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,491
What?

244
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:08,796
Hey, come on!
Keep it down, damn it!

245
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:12,083
Please,
please shut that off.

246
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:15,970
Oh, geez.

247
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:20,725
Dean,
you should sit down.

248
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:21,642
<i>You</i> sit down.

249
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:25,379
Out of
all the ways to die,

250
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,181
I never thought
I'd be going out like this.

251
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:31,352
Dean, nobody is going out.

252
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:34,939
Right.

253
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:36,357
What?

254
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:44,198
Samuel's gonna kill me
when he gets here.

255
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:45,416
No, Dean, he's not.

256
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,900
Yes, he is, 'cause
I'm gonna ask him to

257
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:47,711
because <i>you</i> won't do it.

258
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:49,111
Okay, just hold on a second.

259
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:50,354
For what, huh?!
Look at me!

260
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:51,956
- We can figure this out!
- How?!

261
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,845
Why aren't you
freaked out?

262
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,697
- Of course I am!
- Really?

263
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:02,049
'Cause I can hear
your heartbeat,

264
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,083
and it's
pretty damn steady.

265
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:08,756
That's 'cause I'm --
I'm <i>trying</i> to remain calm.

266
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:10,725
Dean, look,
Samuel will know what to do.

267
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:12,476
Come on, man.
I'm a monster, okay?

268
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:14,478
This is not a problem
that you spitball.

269
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:16,897
We got to deal with this
before I hurt somebody.

270
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,232
This is...

271
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:25,072
How's it feel?

272
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:26,824
Now?

273
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:28,959
Now you want to talk
about my feelings?

274
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:30,878
I-I mean physically.

275
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:33,214
How do you think it feels?
Not good!

276
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:34,799
Where you going?

277
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:36,334
Bathroom, okay?

278
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:39,086
News flash, Mr. Wizard --
vampires pee.

279
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:31,839
Dean?

280
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:51,659
Dean.

281
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,794
Hey.

282
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:59,366
Hey.

283
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:02,303
I wasn't expecting you
for a couple of days.

284
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,922
Yeah, yeah.

285
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:06,757
I wanted to see you.

286
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:09,093
What --
oh, God.

287
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:12,730
Are you okay?

288
00:19:12,814 --> 00:19:14,815
Listen --
what's going on?

289
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:16,183
It doesn't matter.

290
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:18,552
But I need you to know --

291
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:20,321
you <i>and</i> Ben.

292
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,657
Just, uh...

293
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:28,829
Thanks. Okay?

294
00:19:28,897 --> 00:19:30,197
For everything.

295
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,501
Dean,
you're scaring me.

296
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,911
Oh, God, I'm Pattinson.

297
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:45,412
What?

298
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:46,931
Nothing.
I-I-I got to go.

299
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:49,416
No. No, you can't just show up
here like this and then --

300
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:50,601
believe me, I wish it was different.
Just stop!

301
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:52,853
And explain to me what's
going on out there.

302
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:58,659
Lis, I can't bring this crap
home to you.

303
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:00,978
You're talking
about your work.

304
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:04,231
I'm talking about my life.

305
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,766
It's ugly.

306
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:08,285
And it's violent.

307
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,938
And I'm gonna die.
Soon.

308
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,276
Just tell me.

309
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:19,163
Just tell me what the hell
is going on.

310
00:20:38,132 --> 00:20:39,400
Dean?

311
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:41,735
I got to go.

312
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:51,579
Dean?

313
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:54,331
Ben, just stay there.

314
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,449
I thought
I heard you --

315
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,867
I said stay back!

316
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:07,995
You can't keep track
of your brother now?

317
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:09,296
Well...

318
00:21:09,347 --> 00:21:11,215
I mean, I didn't think
he'd just --

319
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:12,600
he's not himself, Sam!

320
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:15,553
He's a monster,
and he's hungry.

321
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:20,841
I've got to prepare to do
the right thing.

322
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:23,343
I told you he'd kill me
when showed up.

323
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:28,499
Did you feed?

324
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:33,353
I went to say goodbye
to Lisa.

325
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:37,207
Which, for the record,
is a lousy idea.

326
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:38,292
Dean,
answer the question.

327
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:52,006
You can relax.
I didn't drink anyone.

328
00:21:53,391 --> 00:21:54,975
Thank God.

329
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:58,045
But I came close.

330
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,709
All right.

331
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:16,013
Do it.

332
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:24,505
Okay. If you insist.

333
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:30,260
Or I can
just turn you back.

334
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:32,296
- What?
- What?

335
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:37,051
I didn't drive all this way
to kill you, Dean.

336
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:38,886
I'm here to save you.

337
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:48,812
That's my grandfather's
journal.

338
00:22:48,897 --> 00:22:50,864
Cure's an old
Campbell recipe.

339
00:22:50,932 --> 00:22:52,432
Kind of like the soup.

340
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:54,068
No one's tried it
since God knows.

341
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,039
From what I hear,
the stuff is a bad trip.

342
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:00,658
Awesome.

343
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:03,443
Hey, the cure is good.
But a lot of this is on you.

344
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:05,579
You drink, you're done.
It won't work.

345
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,498
I'm talking
one drop of human blood.

346
00:23:07,582 --> 00:23:09,333
- I got it.
- Do you?

347
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:12,553
Because you <i>will</i> feed.
It's a matter of time.

348
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,972
What else do we need?

349
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:17,725
Some stuff we got,
some we got to get.

350
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,560
Trickiest thing
on the list --

351
00:23:19,627 --> 00:23:21,011
blood of the fang
who turned you.

352
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:22,680
That guy was huge.

353
00:23:22,764 --> 00:23:24,515
There's nothing in the recipe
about easy.

354
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,683
I can get it.

355
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:27,467
You're gonna walk
right into the nest?

356
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,354
Well, I'm one of them,
aren't I?

357
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:33,023
So all I got to do
is get in there,

358
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:34,608
get the guy alone,
and...

359
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:36,794
Shoot him with so much
dead man's blood

360
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:38,912
he'll think
he's rushing a fraternity.

361
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,064
I should
come with you.

362
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:41,281
No. Dude, you reek.

363
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:43,033
You're like
a walking hamburger.

364
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:44,585
I got to do this solo.

365
00:23:44,652 --> 00:23:47,621
Yeah, except we haven't
been able to find him yet.

366
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:48,922
No problem.
I can smell them.

367
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,340
They're two miles
east of town.

368
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:53,360
You guys get the other crap
and meet me there.

369
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:55,596
Dean!

370
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,768
It's dead man's blood.

371
00:24:00,835 --> 00:24:03,270
Now, there's enough there to
drop a linebacker and then some.

372
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:10,978
Good luck, son.

373
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:28,245
What the hell's
wrong with you, Sam?

374
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:29,880
What do you mean?

375
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:32,166
You knew
about the cure.
What?

376
00:24:32,217 --> 00:24:33,634
No I didn't.

377
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:35,552
Thought we talked about it,
months ago.

378
00:24:35,637 --> 00:24:39,056
Not me. It must have been
Christian or something.

379
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,225
Huh.

380
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:44,061
That's strange,
'cause if you <i>had</i> known,

381
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:45,679
it'd be almost like
you <i>let</i> him get turned.

382
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,714
Get a man on the inside,

383
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:49,883
help us find that Alpha vamp
we've been looking for?

384
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:55,222
You serious?

385
00:24:56,908 --> 00:24:59,276
You think I'd do something
like that, risk my own brother?

386
00:25:01,262 --> 00:25:03,464
What's wrong with <i>you?</i>

387
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:11,638
Look, I'm just relieved
we can fix him.

388
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:14,467
'Sup?

389
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,653
Hey. Uh, I'm --

390
00:26:16,738 --> 00:26:18,572
the guy Boris turned
outside the bar, right?

391
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:21,742
He said
to look out for you.

392
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,244
Yeah.

393
00:26:24,312 --> 00:26:26,613
Well,
glad you made it, man.

394
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:31,285
Oh.

395
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:33,787
Follow me.

396
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:49,102
So, you must be starving.

397
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,021
Uh...

398
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,732
Here you go.

399
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:07,687
I'm okay.

400
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,625
I killed so many people
on the way over here,

401
00:27:11,692 --> 00:27:13,327
so...

402
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:15,913
Yeah, uh, about that.

403
00:27:15,997 --> 00:27:18,832
Company line is we don't just
kill people anymore.

404
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:22,886
But you got to
tell me what that's like.

405
00:27:22,954 --> 00:27:25,222
Yeah.

406
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:29,042
Yeah, first chance I get,
I'll -- I'll show you myself.

407
00:27:29,093 --> 00:27:31,044
Sweet.

408
00:27:43,524 --> 00:27:47,110
Don't worry about them.

409
00:27:47,195 --> 00:27:49,229
They're jealous.

410
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,249
The recruiters
get to bang all the chicks.

411
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,201
That's you now, bro.

412
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,288
Recruiters?

413
00:27:58,373 --> 00:28:00,507
Yeah.

414
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:03,493
Big man will explain.

415
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:07,014
Be with you
in a minute.

416
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,719
"Your skin is the black velvet
of the night."

417
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:17,524
Nice. That stupid bitch will
eat that up.

418
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:20,610
She'll be dying
to meet.

419
00:28:23,898 --> 00:28:27,600
Go get yourself some blood,
sweetheart.

420
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:31,071
Then march that little ass
right back here, okay?

421
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:42,332
You.

422
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:45,285
Thank goodness.

423
00:28:45,336 --> 00:28:49,673
I thought the hunter
chopped your pretty head.

424
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:50,924
No, I got away.

425
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,844
Sorry,
what's a hunter?

426
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:56,596
You'll see,
if he finds us.

427
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,765
You'll see him inside out.

428
00:29:00,818 --> 00:29:03,153
You eaten?

429
00:29:03,237 --> 00:29:04,738
Yeah.

430
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:06,857
Good.

431
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:08,241
You'll need
your strength.

432
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:09,609
For?

433
00:29:12,914 --> 00:29:14,581
Robert didn't tell you?

434
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:22,539
How old do I look?

435
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:26,626
Uh, 33?

436
00:29:27,795 --> 00:29:29,930
You're off.

437
00:29:29,997 --> 00:29:33,833
By about...Six centuries.

438
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:37,837
And these are the best days
in the last 600 years

439
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:39,773
to be a vampire.

440
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:44,728
Dracula, Anne Rice?
Please.

441
00:29:44,812 --> 00:29:47,364
These stupid little brats
are so horny,

442
00:29:47,448 --> 00:29:50,683
they reinvented us
as prince charming with a Volvo.

443
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:54,905
They want a promise ring
with fangs.

444
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:57,157
So I give it to 'em.

445
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:00,860
You -- you go out,
you get them,

446
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:02,329
and you bring 'em
home to me.

447
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:07,634
So what's with
the cages?

448
00:30:07,701 --> 00:30:10,587
Oh, that's just, you know,
till they're compliant.

449
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:13,390
Eventually,
these girls will go out,

450
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,225
and they'll fetch me
boys like you.

451
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:17,710
And around and around
we go.

452
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:20,380
I got to say,
I'm impressed.

453
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:24,351
This whole system,
that's -- that's all you?

454
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:26,219
No, no, no, no, no.

455
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:29,523
No, I just implement,
you know?

456
00:30:29,574 --> 00:30:31,891
Make sure that you all
fall in line.

457
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:34,528
It's his.

458
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:39,866
Our father's.

459
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,785
Hmm. Your father's?

460
00:30:46,507 --> 00:30:49,242
Aren't you
the curious one.

461
00:30:49,293 --> 00:30:51,011
Oh, you don't
know the half of it.

462
00:30:51,078 --> 00:30:52,095
Hmm.

463
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,048
In due time.

464
00:30:57,185 --> 00:31:01,104
You, uh...

465
00:31:01,189 --> 00:31:04,424
You want the private tour,
don't you?

466
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:08,979
Thought you'd never ask.

467
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:34,504
You playing games
with me, boy?

468
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:52,022
Father!

469
00:33:20,444 --> 00:33:22,696
Go get him!

470
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:01,650
This must be the place.

471
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:05,145
Shh.

472
00:34:38,963 --> 00:34:40,931
So much for undercover.

473
00:34:40,982 --> 00:34:42,316
Let's go.

474
00:35:19,336 --> 00:35:21,271
You've stopped nothing.
You know that?

475
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:33,400
This is much bigger
than you and me.

476
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:21,748
Looks like your brother has
some Campbell in him after all.

477
00:36:37,283 --> 00:36:38,951
Dean, you okay?

478
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:43,822
Yeah, I'm good.

479
00:37:03,643 --> 00:37:06,044
If this works,

480
00:37:06,096 --> 00:37:06,979
it's not gonna be a kiddie
ride. You know that.

481
00:37:07,046 --> 00:37:10,715
That's great.
Light her up.

482
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:13,268
So what did you see
in there?

483
00:37:13,353 --> 00:37:15,354
What?
In the nest.
What did you see?

484
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:16,605
Sam, I can't hear you.

485
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:18,023
Your -- your blood
is so freaking loud, okay?

486
00:37:18,074 --> 00:37:20,442
Just -- just back off.

487
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:21,893
Give me the damn cure.

488
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:32,070
L'chaim.

489
00:37:48,138 --> 00:37:49,138
I don't think it --

490
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:56,478
is it working?

491
00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:57,729
Either that
or he's dying.

492
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:23,862
Hey.
So, what did you see?

493
00:39:23,914 --> 00:39:26,465
What?

494
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:28,033
In the nest.
What did you see?

495
00:39:29,836 --> 00:39:32,171
Um, well, I'm still
trying to work through it,

496
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:33,389
but, uh, I'm pretty sure

497
00:39:33,473 --> 00:39:35,057
they're not figuring out
anything on their own.

498
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:36,759
They're getting their orders
from the top --

499
00:39:36,843 --> 00:39:39,178
where to go next,
everything.

500
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:40,546
The top as in...

501
00:39:40,597 --> 00:39:42,098
Their Alpha.

502
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:43,882
At least,
that's what I think it is.

503
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:46,885
They've got some sort
of psychic thing happening.

504
00:39:46,937 --> 00:39:50,239
And he sends them, uh --
I don't know -- messages.

505
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:52,241
Saying what?

506
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:53,993
Honestly?

507
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,361
Recruitment drive.

508
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,165
Their Alpha's
building an army.

509
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,850
Well,
that's comforting.

510
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,201
That's not the worst.

511
00:40:02,252 --> 00:40:04,704
Then what is?

512
00:40:04,755 --> 00:40:07,673
We don't
scare them anymore.

513
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,334
<i>You've reached Lisa.</i>

514
00:40:18,402 --> 00:40:20,352
<i>Leave me a message.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

515
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:24,190
Hey, Lis.

516
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:26,192
Um...

517
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:28,594
<i>To continue recording,</i>
<i>press 1.</i>

518
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:29,895
<i>To erase --</i>

519
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:37,353
How did it go with Lisa?

520
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:38,954
It didn't.

521
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:40,773
I'm sorry.

522
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:42,941
Yeah.

523
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:45,444
At least, uh...

524
00:40:45,495 --> 00:40:47,496
You got my back.

525
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:49,114
No matter what happens,
I can always count on you,

526
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,750
right, Sammy?

527
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:55,454
Yeah.
Of course, Dean.
