1
00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:03,880
We're gonna find a way
to beat the Devil, okay?

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:05,919
What if you guys lead
the Devil to the edge...

3
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:07,019
...and I jump in.

4
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:08,750
Yes!

5
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,219
Sammy's long gone.

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,089
What are you
gonna do now?

7
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:16,174
Return to Heaven, I suppose.

8
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,042
Heaven?

9
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:19,727
With Michael in the cage, I'm
sure it's total anarchy up there.

10
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:22,063
So, what, you're
the new sheriff in town?

11
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,315
It's civil war up there!

12
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:26,851
If we can beat Raphael,
we can end this!

13
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,269
When the oil burns,

14
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:29,937
no angel can touch
or pass through the flames,

15
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:31,722
or he dies.

16
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:35,827
It's his soul.
It's gone.

17
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:38,196
When we freaks die,
where do we go?

18
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,563
Not Heaven, not Hell.

19
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:41,249
- Purgatory.
- And I want it.

20
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,837
The human soul is more valuable
than you can imagine.

21
00:00:45,904 --> 00:00:47,405
This is about the souls.

22
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,340
That Angel went and created

23
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,543
50,000 new souls
for your war machine.

24
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,847
Eve, the mother of all of us.

25
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:58,582
- It's Crowley I want dead.
- Well, you're too late there.

26
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:01,052
That little limey mook
roasted months ago.

27
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,086
Crowley's alive.

28
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,223
Aah!

29
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,891
Really, Cass...

30
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,526
this is getting ridiculous.

31
00:01:08,593 --> 00:01:10,228
How many times

32
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,313
am I gonna have to
clean up your messes?

33
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,961
You know, I've...

34
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,832
I've been here
for a very long time.

35
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:39,457
I remember many things.

36
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:42,061
I remember being at a shoreline,

37
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:47,565
watching a little gray fish
heave itself up on the beach

38
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,917
and an older brother saying,

39
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,186
"Don't step on that fish, Castiel,

40
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:55,072
big plans for that fish."

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,192
I remember the Tower of Babel...

42
00:01:58,277 --> 00:01:59,911
all 37 feet of it,

43
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:02,413
which I suppose was impressive
at the time.

44
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:06,534
And when it fell,
they howled "Divine Wrath".

45
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:07,835
But come on.

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,539
Dried dung can only be stacked
so high.

47
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:14,125
I remember Cain and Abel...

48
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,826
David and Goliath...

49
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:18,813
Sodom and Gomorrah.

50
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,634
And, of course,

51
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,003
I remember
the most remarkable event...

52
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:31,442
Remarkable
because it never came to pass.

53
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,178
It was averted by two boys...

54
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:36,714
an old drunk...

55
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,115
and a fallen Angel.

56
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:42,119
The Grand Story.

57
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:44,539
And we ripped up the ending

58
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,740
and the rules...

59
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:48,743
and Destiny...

60
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:52,480
Leaving nothing
but freedom and choice.

61
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:58,202
Which is all well and good,
except...

62
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:04,425
Well, what if I've made
the wrong choice?

63
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:06,677
How am I supposed to know?

64
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:11,332
I'm getting ahead of myself.

65
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:15,369
Let me tell you my story.

66
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,826
Let me tell you everything.

67
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:28,447
    Season 6 Episode 20
"The Man Who Would Be King"

68
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,915
Hello, Dean.

69
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:48,686
Are you all right?

70
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:50,588
Yeah, I'm...

71
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,474
I'm fine.
How are you?

72
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:56,644
Just wanted to check in.

73
00:03:56,712 --> 00:04:00,982
So, any word on, uh,
Satan Jr. Being alive?

74
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,901
I'm... looking, believe me.

75
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,371
I just don't understand
how Crowley could've tricked me.

76
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,709
Well, he's a tricky
son of a bitch, that's how.

77
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:13,294
Doesn't matter.

78
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,779
But if he is up and kicking,

79
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:19,300
then what does matter
is finding him,

80
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,586
ripping his head off,
and shoving it up his ass.

81
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,842
What about you?
Have you found anything?

82
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:31,513
No, nothing yet.

83
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:35,349
Where's Sam?

84
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:36,800
He's keeping busy.

85
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:39,970
He's tracking a Djinn in Omaha
as we speak.

86
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:42,490
In fact, I'm heading out there
right now to meet up with him.

87
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,824
Well, I'd come if I could.

88
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,444
Yeah, no, I-I get it.
No worries.

89
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,780
But, Cass, you'll call, right?

90
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,250
If you get into real trouble?

91
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:16,557
Howdy, partner.

92
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:17,675
What have you found?

93
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:19,810
I've found a lot of things.

94
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,812
For example...

95
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,348
Eve's brain?
Dead as a tinned kipper.

96
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,650
And yet...

97
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,320
for some reason...

98
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,255
she keeps laying eggs.

99
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,527
Watch this.

100
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,260
Chocula here
feels every tickle.

101
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:54,645
What is that good for?

102
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:56,981
Apart from the obvious
erotic value, you got me.

103
00:05:57,048 --> 00:06:00,217
You said Eve could open
the door to Purgatory.

104
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:01,936
Correct. I did.

105
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:03,487
And I'm confident
that she could have

106
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:05,322
if she was still alive!

107
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,408
Single best chance
to get over the rainbow,

108
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,892
and the Winchesters killed her!

109
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:09,860
It was unavoidable.

110
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,696
You screwed up, Cass.

111
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:14,582
You let the hounds
mangle the pheasant,

112
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,284
and now
I am up to my elbows in it.

113
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:18,402
What is your point?

114
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,371
The point is...

115
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,573
you're distracted,
and that makes me nervous.

116
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:25,342
I am holding up my end.

117
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,910
Ah, yes.

118
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:29,013
But is that all you're holding?

119
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:33,718
See...

120
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,689
...the stench of that Impala's
all over your overcoat, Angel.

121
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:40,608
I thought we'd agreed...

122
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,526
no more nights out
with the boys.

123
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,395
I spoke with Dean.

124
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:45,863
I needed to know
what they know.

125
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,065
About what?

126
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,400
About me, maybe?

127
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,118
'Cause I happen to have it
on good authority

128
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,453
that your two little pets

129
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,055
are currently trying
to hunt me down!

130
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,993
Forgive me, but...

131
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:02,747
I think you might have a little
conflict of interest here.

132
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,501
Crowley had a point, of course.

133
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:11,088
My interest was conflicted.

134
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:14,625
I still considered myself
the Winchesters' guardian.

135
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:16,060
After all...

136
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:18,345
they taught me
how to stand up...

137
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,396
Hey! Ass butt!

138
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,135
Aaaaaaaahh!

139
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:27,071
...what to stand for...

140
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:30,191
and what generally happens
to you when you do.

141
00:07:36,448 --> 00:07:39,533
I was done.

142
00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:43,003
I was over.

143
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,823
And then the most extraordinary
thing happened.

144
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,627
I was put back.

145
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:54,965
And we had won.

146
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,468
We stopped Armageddon.

147
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:02,106
But at a terrible cost.

148
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:10,047
And so I knew
what I had to do next.

149
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:20,691
Once again,
I went to harrow Hell

150
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:23,794
to free Sam
from Lucifer's cage.

151
00:08:23,862 --> 00:08:26,664
It was nearly impossible,

152
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:31,085
but I was so full
of confidence, of mission.

153
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,988
I see now that was arrogance...

154
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,540
hubris...

155
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:38,208
Because, of course,
I hadn't truly raised Sam...

156
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,310
not all of him.

157
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:59,496
Sometimes we're lucky enough
to be given a warning.

158
00:08:59,564 --> 00:09:02,616
This should have been mine.

159
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:08,873
Please.

160
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,925
I'm begging you, Castiel.

161
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,760
Just kill the Winchesters.

162
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:13,878
- No.
- Fine.

163
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,380
Then I'll do it myself.

164
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:17,030
If you kill them, I'll just
bring them back again.

165
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:17,965
No, you won't.

166
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:19,483
Not where I'll put 'em.
Trust me.

167
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:21,635
I said... no.

168
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,272
Don't worry about them.

169
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,591
Don't worry about...

170
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:29,610
What, like Lucifer didn't worry?

171
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,028
Or Michael?

172
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:34,114
Or Lilith or Alistair
or Azazel didn't worry?!

173
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,383
Am I the only game piece
on the board

174
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,303
who doesn't underestimate
those denim-wrapped nightmares?!

175
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:44,458
Just find Purgatory.

176
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:46,443
If you don't, we will both die

177
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:49,279
again and again,
until the end of time.

178
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:57,287
The Winchesters
won't get to you.

179
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,640
Let them get to me!

180
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,026
I'll tear
their friggin' hearts out!

181
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,987
I got to tell you, Redd...

182
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,823
For a filthy,
lower-than-snake-spit hell-spawn,

183
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,009
you seem to have turned yourself
into a damn fine hunter.

184
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,478
I don't know whether
to kill you or kiss you.

185
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:25,199
Oh, please, kill me.

186
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:27,368
That was you that dug out
that nest of vamps

187
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:29,069
back in Swan Valley, wasn't it?

188
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:31,038
That was nice work.

189
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:34,224
Eight of 'em in one go,
roped and tied.

190
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,960
And then you brought them
to Crowley, right?

191
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:38,262
Read the papers, redneck.

192
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,465
The king is dead.

193
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:47,471
Ugh! Nng!

194
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,223
Crowley's alive.

195
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:54,278
You prove it just by being,
you poor, dumb jackass.

196
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,817
Crowley's alive.
His nets are still out.

197
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,853
Except now he's using you
schmucks to hunt his monsters.

198
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:03,988
Mm.

199
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,355
Up yours.

200
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:25,426
Redd...

201
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,046
where's Crowley?

202
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,716
No? Nothing?

203
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,552
Oh, okay, then.

204
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:37,888
Here, hang on to this
for a bit.

205
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,659
Aaaaaaaaaaahh!

206
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:46,897
Aaaaaaaaaaaahh!

207
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,067
So, what'd you tell him?

208
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:51,568
Nothing. Just relax.

209
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,870
What's the hub-bub?

210
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,121
I saw Cass.

211
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:55,839
He popped in on me
about two hours back.

212
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:56,874
What'd you tell him?

213
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,208
Nothing, all right?

214
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,094
Told him we were
on some crap monster hunt.

215
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,179
He doesn't know that
we're getting close to Crowley.

216
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,133
You know, he's our friend...

217
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:08,719
and we are lying to him
through our teeth.

218
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,370
Dean... so he burned
the wrong bones.

219
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,889
So Crowley tricked him.

220
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,590
He's an Angel.

221
00:12:13,641 --> 00:12:14,942
He is the Balki Bartokomous
of Heaven!

222
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,143
He can make a mistake!

223
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:17,644
Nobody's saying nothing yet.

224
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:20,197
You think that Cass
is in with Crowley.

225
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:21,398
Crowley?

226
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,867
Look, I'm just saying
I don't know.

227
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,653
Now, look, I hate myself
for even thinking it.

228
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:28,906
But I don't know.

229
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:33,327
Look, Dean,
he's our friend, too, okay?

230
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:35,746
And I'd die for him.
I would, but...

231
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,748
Look,
I'm praying we're wrong here.

232
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,166
But if we ain't...

233
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,920
If there's a snowball
of a snowball's chance here...

234
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,622
that means we're dealing with a
Superman who's gone dark side...

235
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:48,292
Which means
we've got to be cautious,

236
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,626
we got to be smart,

237
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:52,345
and maybe stock up
on some kryptonite.

238
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:57,134
This makes you Lois Lane.

239
00:12:58,753 --> 00:13:00,487
Look, one problem at a time here.

240
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,756
We got to find Crowley now,

241
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,526
before the damn fool
cracks open Purgatory.

242
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:09,980
So they already suspected.

243
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:12,315
- Where's Crowley?
- Up yours.

244
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:16,253
Aaaaaaaaaaaaahh!

245
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,957
And the worst part was Dean

246
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:23,544
trying so hard to be loyal.

247
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:27,464
With every instinct
telling him otherwise.

248
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,966
I don't know where Crowley is!

249
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,718
Are you sure about that?

250
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:34,138
'Cause we can twist again
all the way to next summer.

251
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,689
Oh, God!

252
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,940
I never even met him!

253
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,010
I don't deal
with Crowley direct.

254
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:41,478
Well, who do you deal with?

255
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,313
The dispatcher.

256
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,349
A demon named Ellsworth.

257
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:56,410
If there was a demon
counterpart to Bobby Singer,

258
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:57,494
Ellsworth would be it.

259
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,863
No, listen to me.

260
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:02,365
No. I don't care.

261
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:04,384
I want you to get down
to New Mexico

262
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,386
and bag me that wendigo!

263
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,921
Hell. Hang on.

264
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:10,641
- What?
- No more vampires.

265
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,092
Because the boss says
we're done with them.

266
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:19,183
FBI. Thomas speaking.

267
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:23,487
Absolutely, I sent them.
Thanks for calling to check.

268
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:24,938
You too.
Have a nice day, now.

269
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,490
Bye-bye.

270
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:27,608
Hey, hey, hey! No!

271
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,159
Not in here, you friggin' yeti.

272
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:31,578
Out back!

273
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,064
These demons would lead
the Winchesters to Crowley,

274
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:37,117
and Crowley would
tear their hearts out.

275
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:43,790
Oh, hell.

276
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:59,756
I had no choice.

277
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:01,775
I did it to protect the boys.

278
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,727
Or to protect myself.
I don't know anymore.

279
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,885
Hey.
Clear from the back.

280
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:23,554
Demons get tipped
and bugged out?

281
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:26,040
Maybe they run from us now.

282
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:27,808
I mean, that would be
a nice thought, right?

283
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:28,959
Yeah, if that's what happened.

284
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,129
Yeah.

285
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,802
Hiding...

286
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:39,470
lying...

287
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,071
sweeping away evidence.

288
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,960
And my motives
used to be so pure.

289
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:48,779
After supposedly "saving" Sam,

290
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,247
I finally returned to Heaven.

291
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,371
Of course,
there isn't one Heaven.

292
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,592
Each soul
generates its own paradise.

293
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:04,845
I favored
the eternal Tuesday afternoon

294
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,132
of an autistic man who drowned
in a bathtub in 1953.

295
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,780
You're alive.

296
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:25,282
Yes.

297
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,984
Castiel, we saw
Lucifer destroy you.

298
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:29,403
Well, I came back.

299
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:32,289
But Lucifer? Michael?

300
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:34,191
They're gone.

301
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:36,043
It was God, wasn't it?

302
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:38,211
No.

303
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,331
It was the Winchesters.

304
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,534
They brought down
the Apocalypse.

305
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,670
But you beat the archangels,
Castiel.

306
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:48,122
God brought you back.

307
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,706
He chose you, Cass...

308
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,891
to lead us.

309
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,510
No.

310
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:55,212
No one leads us anymore.

311
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:58,015
We're all free
to make our own choices

312
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:59,817
and to choose our own fates.

313
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:05,189
What does God want?

314
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,725
God wants you to have freedom.

315
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,812
But what does he want us
to do with it?

316
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,448
If I knew then
what I know now...

317
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,033
I might have said...

318
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:18,452
"It's simple.

319
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,321
"Freedom is a length of rope.

320
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:22,373
God wants you
to hang yourself with it."

321
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,793
Those first weeks
back in Heaven

322
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,411
were surprisingly difficult.

323
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:29,513
Explaining freedom to angels

324
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,600
is a bit like teaching poetry
to fish.

325
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:37,921
And then there was Raphael...

326
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,590
You came.

327
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:42,943
I appreciate
the courage that takes.

328
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,819
Whose Heaven is this?

329
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,255
Ken Lay's.
I'm borrowing it.

330
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:57,708
I still question
his admittance here.

331
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,109
He's devout.

332
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,628
Trumps everything.

333
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:05,449
What do you want?

334
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,800
Tomorrow...

335
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:09,003
I've called for a full assembly
of the Holy Host.

336
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,021
You'll kneel before me

337
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,390
and pledge allegiance
to the flag, all right?

338
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,908
And what flag is that?

339
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:16,510
Me, Castiel.

340
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,928
Allegiance to me.

341
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,613
Are you joking?

342
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,682
Do I look like I'm joking?

343
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,985
You never look like
you're joking.

344
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,838
You rebelled...
against God, Heaven, and me.

345
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,474
Now you will atone.

346
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,977
We'll start by freeing Lucifer
and Michael from their cage.

347
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,747
And then we'll get our show
back on the road.

348
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:39,033
Raphael... no.

349
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:42,953
The Apocalypse
doesn't have to be fought!

350
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:44,988
Of course it does.
It's God's will.

351
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,990
How can you say that?!

352
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,126
Because it's what I want.

353
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:51,161
Well, the other angels
won't let you.

354
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:53,230
Are you sure?

355
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,133
You know better than anyone,
Castiel.

356
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:57,551
They're soldiers.

357
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,154
They weren't built for freedom.
They were built to follow.

358
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:08,862
Then I won't let you.

359
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,114
Really?

360
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,183
You?

361
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,466
I'm not ashamed to say

362
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:32,469
that my big brother knocked me
into next week.

363
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:35,055
Tomorrow you kneel, Castiel...

364
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,624
or you
and anyone with you dies.

365
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:43,063
Hey...

366
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,766
The place is clean.

367
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,519
Yeah, but it's...

368
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,238
it's like "Mr. Clean" clean,
you know?

369
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:53,407
It's kind of OCD
for your average demon.

370
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:54,491
Yeah. So what now?

371
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,926
- We'd call Cass.
- What?

372
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:02,366
This is usually the point where
we would call Cass for help.

373
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,951
We talked about this.

374
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:05,202
Yeah, Dean.

375
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:07,921
No, you talked.
I listened.

376
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:11,074
This is Cass, guys.

377
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,044
I mean,
when there was no one...

378
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:16,130
and we were stuck...
and I mean really stuck...

379
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:17,514
he broke ranks.

380
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:19,583
He has gone to the mat
cut and bleeding for us

381
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,268
so many freakin' times.

382
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:23,554
This is Cass!

383
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:26,956
Don't we owe him the benefit
of the doubt at least?

384
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:32,946
Castiel...

385
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,398
this is really important, okay?

386
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:37,367
Um...
we really need to talk to you.

387
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:40,871
Castiel...

388
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:42,289
Come on in.

389
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,879
But I didn't go to them...

390
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,498
because I knew they would have
questions I couldn't answer...

391
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:53,884
Because I was afraid.

392
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:59,223
Cass is busy.

393
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,725
That's all right.
We are, too.

394
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,795
Come on.

395
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,630
Back to square one.

396
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:08,315
Great.
Well, what do we do now?

397
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,901
Well, we caught
one hunter demon before.

398
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:12,820
- We can do it again.
- Dean!

399
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,393
Crowley says "hi."

400
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,260
Crowley sent his very best.

401
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,380
I was caught as much
by surprise as the rest of them.

402
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,717
And it left me
with yet another choice.

403
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:42,191
I could reveal myself
and smite the demons.

404
00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:44,259
Of course,
Crowley wouldn't like it.

405
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:47,562
But on the other hand,
they were my friends.

406
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,459
For a brief moment...

407
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:01,994
I was me again.

408
00:22:09,636 --> 00:22:12,304
It is good to see you, Cass.

409
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:13,355
You all right?

410
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:14,690
Yeah.

411
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:15,808
Perfect timing, Cass.

412
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:16,975
I'm glad I found you.

413
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,694
I come with news.

414
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:20,028
Yeah? What?

415
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:24,400
I firmly believe
Crowley is alive.

416
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,053
Yeah.
You think, Kojak?

417
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:34,259
Well, Bobby, what do we think
about Cass saving our asses...

418
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:35,711
again?

419
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:40,416
I think we owe you an apology.

420
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:43,168
Why?

421
00:22:43,253 --> 00:22:45,287
We've been hunting Crowley
this whole time...

422
00:22:45,338 --> 00:22:46,889
And keeping it from you.

423
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:48,924
We thought...

424
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,592
you were working with him.

425
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,361
You thought what?

426
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:53,979
I know. It's crazy, right?

427
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:57,266
It's just that
you torched the wrong bones.

428
00:22:57,317 --> 00:22:59,351
It doesn't matter.
We... we were wrong.

429
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:01,854
You know...

430
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:03,572
You could've just asked me.

431
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:05,574
And we should have.

432
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:08,043
We never should've doubted you.
It's...

433
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:11,163
I just hope you can forgive us.

434
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:15,918
Wonders never cease.

435
00:23:15,985 --> 00:23:18,871
They trusted me again.

436
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:20,839
But it was just another lie.

437
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:21,924
It's forgotten.

438
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:24,009
Thanks.

439
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:25,761
Yeah.

440
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:27,129
Thanks, Cass.

441
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:29,765
It is a little absurd, though.

442
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:31,517
I know, I know.

443
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:33,218
Superman going to the dark side.

444
00:23:36,573 --> 00:23:39,308
I'm still just Castiel.

445
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:43,896
I guess we can put away
the kryptonite, right?

446
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,731
Exactly.

447
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:47,516
Of course, I didn't realize it
at the time.

448
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:49,952
But it was all over.

449
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:52,321
Right then... just like that.

450
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:55,157
You sent demons after them?

451
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,793
You kill my hunters.
Why can't I kill yours?

452
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,578
They're my friends.

453
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:01,497
You can't have friends,
not anymore.

454
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:03,131
I mean, my God.
You're losing it!

455
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,216
I'm fine.

456
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,467
Yeah.

457
00:24:05,535 --> 00:24:07,252
You're the very picture
of mental health.

458
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:09,254
Come on. You don't think I know
what this is all about?

459
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:11,173
Enlighten me.

460
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:13,759
The big lie...
the Winchesters still buy it.

461
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:16,595
The good Cass,
the righteous Cass.

462
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,514
And long
as they still believe it,

463
00:24:18,565 --> 00:24:19,831
you get to believe it.

464
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:22,017
Well, I got news for you,
kitten.

465
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:23,819
A whore is a whore is a whore.

466
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:29,107
I'm only gonna say this once.

467
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:31,994
If you touch a hair
on their heads,

468
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:34,696
I will tear it all down.

469
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:37,449
Our arrangement...
everything.

470
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:44,039
I'm still an angel,
and I will bury you.

471
00:24:48,545 --> 00:24:50,596
I asked myself,

472
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:52,931
"what was I doing
with this vermin?"

473
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:56,718
This is not how synergy works!

474
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:59,221
As if I didn't already know
the answer.

475
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:03,592
Raphael was stronger than me.

476
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:06,061
And I wouldn't survive
a straight fight.

477
00:25:10,116 --> 00:25:14,202
So I went to an old friend
for help.

478
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,073
But watching him, I stopped.

479
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,876
Everything he sacrificed,

480
00:25:20,943 --> 00:25:23,545
and I was about to ask him
for more.

481
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:25,414
Ah, Castiel.

482
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:28,116
Angel of Thursday.

483
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,585
Just not your day is it?

484
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:31,953
What are you doing here?

485
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:34,423
I want to help you help me
help ourselves.

486
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:35,841
Speak plain.

487
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:38,427
I want to discuss
a simple business transaction.

488
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:39,895
- That's all.
- You want to make a deal?

489
00:25:39,962 --> 00:25:41,096
With me?

490
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,516
I'm an angel, you ass.

491
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:46,318
I don't have a soul to sell.

492
00:25:46,402 --> 00:25:47,469
But that's it, isn't it?

493
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,105
It's all of it.
It's the souls.

494
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:52,824
It all comes down to the souls
in the end, doesn't it?

495
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:54,976
What in the hell
are you talking about?

496
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:56,695
I'm talking about
Raphael's head on a pike.

497
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:00,032
I'm talking about
happy endings for all of us,

498
00:26:00,116 --> 00:26:02,751
with all possible entendres
intended.

499
00:26:02,818 --> 00:26:04,336
Come on.

500
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,254
Just a chat.

501
00:26:06,322 --> 00:26:07,989
I have no interest
in talking with you.

502
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:10,092
Why not?
I'm very interesting.

503
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:13,712
Come on. Hear me out.

504
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:15,847
Five minutes.
No obligations.

505
00:26:15,932 --> 00:26:20,335
I promise...
I'll make it worth your while.

506
00:26:20,386 --> 00:26:22,471
I was no fool.

507
00:26:22,522 --> 00:26:24,856
I knew who Crowley was
and what he did.

508
00:26:24,941 --> 00:26:28,110
But I was smarter than him,
stronger.

509
00:26:28,177 --> 00:26:30,646
I see now that I was prideful.

510
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:33,782
And in all likelihood,
I was a fool.

511
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:50,532
Where are we?

512
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:53,051
You don't recognize it, do you?

513
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:55,637
It's Hades, new and improved.

514
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:57,172
I did it myself.

515
00:26:59,175 --> 00:27:00,492
This is Hell?

516
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,711
Yeah. See,
problem with the old place

517
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:05,731
was most of the inmates
were masochists already.

518
00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:07,649
A lot of "Thank you, sir.

519
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:09,317
Can I have another
hot spike up the jacksie?"

520
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:11,086
But just look at them.

521
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:17,659
No one likes waiting in line.

522
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:19,494
And what happens
when they reach the front?

523
00:27:19,562 --> 00:27:20,696
Nothing.

524
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:22,063
They go right back
to the end again.

525
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:23,398
That's efficiency.

526
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:26,034
You have four minutes left.

527
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:29,287
What are you planning to do
about Raphael?

528
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:32,073
What can I do
besides submit or die?

529
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,908
Submit or die?
What are you, French?

530
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,510
How about resist?

531
00:27:35,578 --> 00:27:37,879
I'm not strong enough,
and you know it.

532
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,347
Ah, not on your own,
you're not.

533
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:40,966
But you're not on your own,
are you?

534
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,685
There's a lot of angels
swooning over you.

535
00:27:43,753 --> 00:27:44,936
"God's favorite."

536
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:47,355
Buddy boy, you've got
what they call sex appeal.

537
00:27:47,423 --> 00:27:49,307
Thank you.
Get to the point.

538
00:27:49,392 --> 00:27:52,260
Angels need leaders, so be one.

539
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:53,528
Gather your army

540
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:56,732
and kick the candy out
of each and every angel

541
00:27:56,783 --> 00:27:58,366
that shows up for Raphael.

542
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:02,103
Are you proposing that I start
a civil war in Heaven?

543
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:04,606
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Tell him what he's won, Vanna.

544
00:28:04,657 --> 00:28:07,942
You're asking me
to be the next Lucifer.

545
00:28:07,994 --> 00:28:09,227
Please.

546
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:12,030
Lucifer was a petulant child
with daddy issues.

547
00:28:12,098 --> 00:28:15,751
Cass, you love God.
God loves you.

548
00:28:15,818 --> 00:28:17,302
He brought you back.

549
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:20,422
Did it occur to you
that maybe he did this

550
00:28:20,473 --> 00:28:23,308
so you could be
the new sheriff upstairs?

551
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:26,762
This is ridiculous.

552
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:28,396
I mean, the amount of power
that it would take

553
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:29,598
to mount a war...

554
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:33,268
More than either of us
have ever seen, yeah.

555
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,938
But what if I said
I knew how to go nuclear?

556
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:39,357
What do you mean?

557
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:41,993
Purgatory,
my fine feathered friend.

558
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:43,945
Purgatory.

559
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:45,664
Just think about it.

560
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:49,584
An untapped oil well
of every fanged, clawed soul.

561
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:52,587
I mean,
what's that over the years?

562
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:53,955
30 million?
40 million?

563
00:28:54,006 --> 00:28:57,342
Just sitting there,
plump and rich for the taking.

564
00:28:57,426 --> 00:29:00,512
How would you even find it
when no one ever has?

565
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:02,380
We'll need expert help.

566
00:29:02,465 --> 00:29:03,632
From whom?

567
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:05,050
From experts, of course.

568
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:06,668
I know of two eerily suited
teen beat models

569
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:07,769
with time on their hands.

570
00:29:07,837 --> 00:29:09,888
No. Not Dean.

571
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:11,940
He's retired,
and he's to stay that way.

572
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:13,558
Fine.

573
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:15,694
Then I know of
a certain big, bald patriarch

574
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:17,112
I can take off the bench.

575
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:19,397
The point is...

576
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:20,982
they can get us
to the monsters.

577
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,168
The monsters
can get us to Purgatory.

578
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:24,402
I know it.

579
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:27,122
And what's your price
in all of this?

580
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,491
- Just half.
- Half?

581
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:31,493
My position isn't
all that stable, ducky.

582
00:29:31,544 --> 00:29:32,661
Those souls would help,

583
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:35,297
just like they'd help you.

584
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:38,199
Besides, wouldn't you rather
have me in charge down here?

585
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:39,484
The devil you know...

586
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,675
This is pointless.

587
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:50,395
Your plan would take months,
and I need help now.

588
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:52,046
Granted.

589
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:53,481
Yes.

590
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:57,519
But just to show you how serious
I am about this scheme...

591
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,554
how about I float you
a little loan?

592
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:02,407
Say, 50 large?

593
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:05,076
50,000 souls from the pit.

594
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:07,329
You can take them up to Heaven.

595
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:10,198
Make quite a showing.

596
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:11,683
It's either this

597
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:13,368
or the Apocalypse
all over again.

598
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:14,736
Everything you've worked for...

599
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:18,957
everything that Sam and Dean
has worked for... gone.

600
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,445
You can save us, Castiel.

601
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:30,769
God chose you to save us.

602
00:30:30,836 --> 00:30:34,422
And I think... deep down...

603
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:36,725
you know that.

604
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:38,260
I wish I could say,

605
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:39,861
'I was clean of pride
at that moment...

606
00:30:41,113 --> 00:30:42,981
...or the next.'

607
00:30:56,796 --> 00:31:00,715
There will be no Apocalypse.

608
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:02,617
And let it be known...

609
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:07,255
you're either with Raphael
or you're with me.

610
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:11,125
And so went the long road
of good intentions...

611
00:31:11,677 --> 00:31:13,795
the road that brought me here.

612
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:19,935
Castiel, uh...

613
00:31:19,986 --> 00:31:21,970
we need you for a little pow-wow
down here,

614
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:24,305
so come on down.

615
00:31:25,942 --> 00:31:27,609
Hello.

616
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:31,479
Oh, Johnny on the spot.

617
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,147
You're still here.

618
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,332
Yeah,
we had to bury the bodies.

619
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:37,151
And we found a little whiskey.

620
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:38,153
Thanks for coming.

621
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,821
How can I help?

622
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:41,957
Oh, look.
We, um... we have a new plan.

623
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:44,009
We think we've finally
figured out a way

624
00:31:44,093 --> 00:31:45,159
to track down Crowley.

625
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:50,215
- What is it?
- It's you.

626
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,970
What are you doing?

627
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:08,322
We got to talk.

628
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:09,690
About what? Let me go!

629
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:10,858
About Superman.

630
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,260
And kryptonite.

631
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,198
How'd you know what I said?

632
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:18,282
How long you been watching us?

633
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,000
You know who spies
on people, Cass?

634
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:21,285
- Spies!
- Okay, just wait.

635
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:24,789
I don't even know
what you mean.

636
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,207
What about this demon crap-hole?

637
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,008
How is it so, uh...

638
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:29,794
next to godliness clean in here?

639
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:32,430
And how exactly did Crowley
trick you with the wrong bones?

640
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,498
It's hard to understand.

641
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:35,933
It's hard to explain.

642
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,635
Just let me go.
Let me out and I can...

643
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:39,687
You got to look at me, man.

644
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:42,056
You got to level with me
and tell me what's going on.

645
00:32:43,692 --> 00:32:44,892
Look me in the eye

646
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:47,728
and tell me you're not
working with Crowley.

647
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:55,786
You son of a bitch.

648
00:32:57,906 --> 00:32:59,406
Let me explain.

649
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:01,375
You're in it with him?

650
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,745
You and Crowley have been going
after Purgatory together?

651
00:33:06,148 --> 00:33:08,916
You have, huh?
This whole time.

652
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,201
I did it to protect you.
I did it to protect all of you.

653
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:13,187
Protect us how?

654
00:33:13,255 --> 00:33:15,256
By opening a hole into monster-land!

655
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,158
He's right, Cass.

656
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:19,260
One drop got through,
and it was Eve.

657
00:33:19,344 --> 00:33:20,427
And you want to break down
the entire dam?

658
00:33:20,545 --> 00:33:21,762
To get the souls.

659
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:24,982
I can stop Raphael.

660
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:26,817
Please, you have to trust me.

661
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:28,352
Trust you?!

662
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:30,437
How in the hell are we
supposed to trust you now?

663
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:31,856
I'm still me.

664
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:34,108
I'm still your friend.

665
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:37,111
Sam...

666
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:39,029
I'm the one who raised you
from perdition.

667
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:43,367
What?

668
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:50,174
Well, no offense...

669
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:53,344
but you did
a pretty piss-poor job of it.

670
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,131
Wait.

671
00:33:58,416 --> 00:33:59,967
Did you bring me back
soulless...

672
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:02,635
on purpose?

673
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:06,190
How could you think that?

674
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:08,025
Well, I'm thinking a lot
of things right now, Cass.

675
00:34:10,811 --> 00:34:11,896
Listen.

676
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:17,117
Raphael will kill us all.

677
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:20,070
He'll turn the world
into a graveyard.

678
00:34:20,121 --> 00:34:21,539
I had no choice.

679
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:23,874
No, you had a choice.

680
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,826
You just made the wrong one.

681
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:29,880
You don't understand.

682
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:31,348
It's complicated.

683
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:34,168
No, actually, it's not,
and you know that.

684
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:36,587
Why else would you keep
this whole thing a secret, huh,

685
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:38,655
unless you knew
that it was wrong?

686
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:43,410
When crap like this
comes around,

687
00:34:43,478 --> 00:34:45,563
we deal with it...

688
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:48,298
like we always have.

689
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,150
What we don't do
is we don't go out

690
00:34:50,235 --> 00:34:52,152
and make another deal
with the devil!

691
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:54,855
It sounds so simple
when you say it like that.

692
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,911
Where were you
when I needed to hear it?

693
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:03,497
I was there.

694
00:35:03,582 --> 00:35:05,199
Where were you?

695
00:35:12,374 --> 00:35:14,508
You should've come to us
for help, Cass.

696
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:18,596
Maybe.

697
00:35:22,717 --> 00:35:24,134
It's too late now.

698
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,190
I can't turn back now.

699
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:31,725
I can't.

700
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,527
It's not too late.

701
00:35:33,612 --> 00:35:35,229
Damn it, Cass!
We can fix this!

702
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:38,015
Dean, it's not broken!

703
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:42,953
Run.

704
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:44,020
You have to run now!

705
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:46,022
Run!

706
00:36:21,057 --> 00:36:22,808
My, my.

707
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:24,410
Playing with fire again?

708
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:28,948
If you touch the Winchesters...

709
00:36:29,032 --> 00:36:32,318
Please,
I heard you the first time.

710
00:36:32,402 --> 00:36:36,505
I promise... nary a hair
on their artfully tousled heads.

711
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:39,158
Besides, I think they've proven
my point for me.

712
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:42,077
It's always your friends,
isn't it, in the end?

713
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:45,080
We try to change.
We try to improve ourselves.

714
00:36:45,148 --> 00:36:48,567
It's always our friends
who got to claw into our sides

715
00:36:48,635 --> 00:36:49,802
and hold us back.

716
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:52,805
But you know what I see here?

717
00:36:52,889 --> 00:36:56,559
The new God and the new Devil,
working together.

718
00:36:56,626 --> 00:36:58,677
Enough!

719
00:36:58,762 --> 00:37:01,180
You stop talking.

720
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:05,651
And get out of my sight.

721
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:10,472
Well...

722
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:12,407
glad I came.

723
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:15,528
You're welcome, by the way.

724
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,142
You know the difference
between you and me?

725
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,195
I know what I am.

726
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:36,966
What are you, Castiel?

727
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:43,171
What exactly
are you willing to do?

728
00:38:08,815 --> 00:38:09,965
Hello, Dean.

729
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:12,551
How'd you get in here?

730
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:15,087
The angel-proofing
Bobby put up on the house...

731
00:38:15,171 --> 00:38:18,140
he got a few things wrong.

732
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:20,259
Well, it's too bad
we got to angel-proof

733
00:38:20,343 --> 00:38:21,727
in the first place, isn't it?

734
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:25,014
Why are you here?

735
00:38:26,983 --> 00:38:28,067
I want you to understand.

736
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:29,902
Oh, believe me, I get it.

737
00:38:31,438 --> 00:38:33,155
Blah, blah, Raphael, right?

738
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:36,358
I'm doing this for you, Dean.

739
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:37,409
I'm doing this because of you.

740
00:38:37,494 --> 00:38:40,395
Because of me.
Yeah.

741
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:43,282
You got to be kidding me.

742
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:47,369
You're the one who taught me
that freedom and free will...

743
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,505
You're a freakin' child,
you know that?

744
00:38:49,572 --> 00:38:52,758
Just because
you can do what you want

745
00:38:52,842 --> 00:38:55,544
doesn't mean that you get to do
whatever you want!

746
00:38:55,595 --> 00:38:57,680
I know what I'm doing, Dean.

747
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:04,520
I'm not gonna logic you, okay?

748
00:39:04,587 --> 00:39:07,606
I'm saying don't...
just 'cause.

749
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:11,827
I'm asking you not to.
That's it.

750
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:13,062
I don't understand.

751
00:39:13,113 --> 00:39:14,446
Look, next to Sam,

752
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:17,066
you and Bobby are the closest
things I have to family...

753
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:19,618
That you are
like a brother to me.

754
00:39:19,703 --> 00:39:22,705
So, if I'm asking you
not to do something...

755
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,976
...you got to trust me, man.

756
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:30,412
Or what?

757
00:39:36,336 --> 00:39:38,470
Or I'll have to do
what I have to do to stop you.

758
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:40,956
You can't, Dean.

759
00:39:41,007 --> 00:39:42,408
You're just a man.

760
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,577
I'm an angel.

761
00:39:45,645 --> 00:39:48,180
I don't know.
I've taken some pretty big fish.

762
00:39:53,687 --> 00:39:55,104
I'm sorry, Dean.

763
00:39:57,674 --> 00:39:59,241
Well, I'm sorry, too, then.

764
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:09,601
So, that's everything.

765
00:40:09,669 --> 00:40:12,705
I believe
it's what you would call a...

766
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:16,375
tragedy, from the human
perspective.

767
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:19,878
But maybe the human perspective
is... limited.

768
00:40:19,963 --> 00:40:21,347
I don't know.

769
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:23,248
That's why
I'm asking you, Father.

770
00:40:24,316 --> 00:40:27,302
One last time.

771
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,722
Am I doing the right thing?

772
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:34,843
Am I on the right path?

773
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:36,278
You have to tell me.

774
00:40:36,345 --> 00:40:38,564
You have to give me... a sign.

775
00:40:40,516 --> 00:40:44,069
Give me a sign.

776
00:40:44,187 --> 00:40:45,287
Because if you don't...

777
00:40:45,354 --> 00:40:47,823
I'm gonna ju...

778
00:40:47,874 --> 00:40:50,793
I'm gonna do whatever I...

779
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,412
whatever I must.
