1
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:03,023
There you are.

2
00:00:03,123 --> 00:00:04,220
You shouldn't have
come here, boys.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,093
Meg!

4
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:06,311
She's a demon, Sam!

5
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:07,729
We're goin' to heaven, Clarence.

6
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:12,818
So, what <i>can</i> you do,
you impotent sap?

7
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:15,103
What the hell
was that thing?

8
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:16,705
- It may have been an Alpha.
- An alpha? Like...

9
00:00:16,772 --> 00:00:18,206
First one who spawned
all the others.

10
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:19,774
There's tons of lore about it.

11
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:21,043
We know you're looking
for Purgatory.

12
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,378
- You want to tell us why?
- Purgatory is vast,

13
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:25,113
underutilized,
and hell-adjacent,

14
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:26,131
and I want it.

15
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:27,299
Bring me creatures.

16
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:28,834
Aim high on the food chain, please.

17
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:31,169
- We ain't your employees.
- Of course you are!

18
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:32,671
You're nothing but
a punk-ass crossroads demon.

19
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:34,622
<i>Was</i> a punk-ass
crossroads demon.

20
00:00:34,674 --> 00:00:36,475
Now... King of Hell.

21
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:38,727
I snap my fingers,
Sam gets his soul back.

22
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:40,929
Or I shove Sam
right back in the hole.

23
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:48,303
I told you.

24
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:49,971
I don't know anything about...

25
00:00:56,312 --> 00:00:58,947
Sorry... but your
exceptional good looks

26
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:01,166
aren't gonna buy you any mercy.

27
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,485
I suggest you talk.

28
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,342
What should we use next?

29
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:11,376
Speculum?

30
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:13,311
Something more exotic?

31
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:15,680
Look, it's Purgatory.

32
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:18,333
All I know is,
I go there when I die.

33
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:20,018
It's not like
I can draw you a map.

34
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:21,820
I happen to know you can.

35
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:22,971
You're wrong.

36
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,773
My sources are unimpeachable.

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,142
You're the father
of your entire species.

38
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:29,694
You're really not pulling off
this dumb-blonde act.

39
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,781
I hope you appreciate

40
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,367
just how much
effort I've gone to,

41
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:38,487
to find something
that can actually hurt you.

42
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:40,038
Yeah, my tinkering

43
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:43,542
has cost several
lesser shifters their lives.

44
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:46,078
Iridium.

45
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,580
Rarer than hell.

46
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:51,633
Would have been cheaper
to drop a castle on you.

47
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,137
But I think we all agree...
worth it.

48
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:57,038
So...

49
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,641
You start talking

50
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:03,378
or I start chopping off
all the bits that stick out.

51
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:06,598
You go ahead, mate.

52
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:08,183
See if it makes me
want to chat.

53
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:11,386
Aah!

54
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:16,525
What was that?

55
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:17,859
Purgatory's where?

56
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:22,114
What is it with you animals?!

57
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,369
Did I tell you

58
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,238
this prison has a nursery?

59
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,373
All yours.

60
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:33,925
I know how much
you care about them.

61
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,379
You've spent months
gathering them to your bosom.

62
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,714
Not so cocky now, are we?

63
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:42,584
Finding Purgatory's
important to me.

64
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:47,055
You have five seconds
to tell me where it is.

65
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:50,425
After that, I'll fillet them
in front of you,

66
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:52,777
toss their spines in your lap.

67
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:57,098
Four, three, two...

68
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,901
Kill them all.
We'll make more.

69
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,835
Guess I kind of lost my head.

70
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:23,908
Season 6 Episode 10 
   "Caged Heat"

71
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:00,762
You're late.

72
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:02,613
You know, traffic was a bitch.

73
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:05,667
One Rugaru.

74
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:06,834
Where's Crowley?

75
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:08,520
Banging a hooker
in a sweet spot

76
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:10,338
- called none of your business.
- Oh!

77
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,507
Look at that, Sam...
demon trying to be funny.

78
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:14,008
Oh, is that what just happened?

79
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,176
Night, girls.

80
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:17,279
Wait, wait.
Hold up, hold up.

81
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:19,364
Are we ever gonna
see Crowley again,

82
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:21,182
or is he just gonna keep sending
his demon extras

83
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:22,534
to pick up his laundry?

84
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:23,735
I'm sorry.
I know you're speaking.

85
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:25,186
I see your lips moving,

86
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:26,854
but I can't understand
what you're saying.

87
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:28,940
'Cause I don't speak
little bitch.

88
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:50,011
Remember when we used to
gank demons?

89
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:54,999
- No, man, screw it. I'm done.
- Calm down.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,568
We have been going on
these freakin' Crowley runs,

91
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,570
and it's not getting us anywhere.

92
00:04:58,654 --> 00:05:00,054
- Dean...
- I mean, the only thing that's really changed

93
00:05:00,106 --> 00:05:02,223
is now I need a daily rape shower.

94
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:05,910
Okay, you're right.
Let's go with plan "B".

95
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:07,762
Oh, yeah.
We don't <i>have</i> one.

96
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,165
So till we do, sorry, dude.

97
00:05:10,232 --> 00:05:11,499
Stock up on soap-on-a-rope.

98
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:16,421
Dean, if you want
to get my soul back,

99
00:05:16,505 --> 00:05:17,756
that's what we got to do, okay?

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,408
Yeah.

101
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:21,960
You even want it back?

102
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:26,748
I'm working for <i>Crowley,</i>
<i>aren't I?</i>

103
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:31,853
Yeah, well,

104
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,723
who says he's gonna
hold up his end, you know?

105
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:36,625
It is Crowley.

106
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:39,394
You ever think of that?

107
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:41,229
Right?

108
00:05:43,282 --> 00:05:46,567
So I guess the moment's over.
Is that what you're saying?

109
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:49,988
Sam!

110
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,475
What now?

111
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:30,328
I think I know who you can ask.

112
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:35,116
Evil bitch.

113
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,751
Keep sweet-talking me,

114
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:39,320
this could go
a whole new direction.

115
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:41,990
Meg. I've been dying
to see you again.

116
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:44,826
Well, here I am, big boy.

117
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:46,311
So, what should we do now?

118
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,196
How 'bout I rip you to shreds?

119
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:50,382
Kinky. I like.

120
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:53,201
But a little Q&A first,
if you don't mind.

121
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:55,019
Now, where's your boss?

122
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:57,072
You think we work for somebody?

123
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,690
I happen to know for a fact

124
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:00,442
you've been juggling
Crowley's orphans.

125
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,794
Now, where is he?

126
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:04,896
Don't know, don't care.

127
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,365
But you been working
his beat for months.

128
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,983
Doesn't mean we get face time.

129
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:22,330
Where's he take all those things
you snatch up for him?

130
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,031
I bet you an all-day sucker

131
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,834
that's where
his majesty's holed up.

132
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:32,223
Okay, officially
over the foreplay.

133
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:33,758
Satisfy me, or I please myself.

134
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,678
Something funny, Sam?

135
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:38,480
Yeah. Meg.

136
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:39,881
Really? 'Cause where I'm sittin'...

137
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:41,983
Don't worry.
She can't do Jack squat.

138
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,601
She's totally screwed.

139
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:44,986
Sam, not helping!

140
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:47,689
Look at her, Dean.
She's furious.

141
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,475
If she <i>could</i> kill you,
she'd have done it by now.

142
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:53,111
She's running.

143
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:55,914
Am I?

144
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:59,033
Judging by the level of
flop sweat on all of you, yeah.

145
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:01,369
Which means
you're running from Crowley.

146
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,787
Which makes sense.

147
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:05,590
Crowley would want to hunt down
all the Lucifer loyalists

148
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:07,208
now that he's big man on campus.

149
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,426
How would you know?

150
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:12,113
It's what I'd do.

151
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:16,851
She can't kill us.

152
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:20,104
She needs us
to get her to Crowley

153
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:22,173
so she can stick
that knife in his neck.

154
00:08:22,241 --> 00:08:23,558
It's him or her.

155
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:26,444
Well, I hope you <i>both</i> lose.

156
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:28,095
But good luck.

157
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:30,448
So, you know
what you got to do now, right?

158
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,066
Let me guess...
you're gonna tell me.

159
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:33,618
Work with us.

160
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:34,819
Whoa, what?

161
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:38,373
We'll hand you Crowley
with a bow.

162
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,775
On one condition...
we go with you,

163
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:42,710
and you help us wring
a little something out of him

164
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:44,629
before you hack him to bits.

165
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,147
- What?
- Doesn't matter.

166
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:47,999
Question is, can you get us
what we need?

167
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,284
I apprenticed
under Alastair in Hell,

168
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:51,836
just like your brother.

169
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:54,589
So, Dean, can I make Crowley
do whatever I want?

170
00:08:57,393 --> 00:08:59,127
Yeah, she can.

171
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:01,646
It's a deal, then.

172
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,348
Hugs and puppies all around.

173
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:06,467
You gonna untie us?

174
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,186
Please.

175
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,271
Don't pretend you don't enjoy it.

176
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:22,783
You gonna kiss me?

177
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,785
Come on.

178
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:34,596
What are you doing?

179
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:36,681
What do you mean?

180
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:38,466
I mean, what are you doing?!

181
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:41,469
Dean, you wanted
to screw over Crowley.

182
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,353
Merry Christmas.

183
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:45,390
What?

184
00:09:45,474 --> 00:09:46,891
You want to work
with a demon again?

185
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:48,309
We're working with demons <i>now.</i>

186
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,811
I'm doing this
'cause I want to <i>stop.</i>

187
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:51,613
She killed Ellen and Jo.

188
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,314
I know. But you can't
look at this emotionally, Dean.

189
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:55,283
- We need her.
- The hell we do.

190
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,951
That little bitch is gonna
screw us over so fast...

191
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:59,320
Of course. Which is why
we'll screw her <i>first.</i>

192
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:01,039
Meg and her little posse are dead

193
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:02,857
the second we're done with them.

194
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:04,876
- Yeah, if they don't kill us.
- Oh, they won't.

195
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,661
'Cause we're bringing insurance.

196
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:20,558
Castiel...

197
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:21,976
we need you.

198
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:23,544
It's important.

199
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:32,820
Cass...

200
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:34,822
we found something.

201
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,891
It... it's this... gold box.

202
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:39,327
Apparently, Nazis were after it
back in the day.

203
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:41,779
Someone tried to open it,
and their face melted off.

204
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:43,414
We think it's, uh...

205
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:45,617
Ready for this?...

206
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:49,454
The Ark of the Covenant.

207
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:51,255
Yeah.

208
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,742
- So...
- I'm here, Sam.

209
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:56,995
Where is the box?

210
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:59,847
I can't believe
you fell for that.

211
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:02,050
That was the plot of "Raiders", idiot.

212
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:03,901
I'm mid-battle, Sam.

213
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:05,136
I could give a rat's ass

214
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:07,188
about your little pissing match
with Raphael.

215
00:11:07,255 --> 00:11:08,940
- Listen to me, Sam...
- No, <i>you</i> listen.

216
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:11,359
I don't care what you're dealing with
up in Heaven. You <i>owe</i> me.

217
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:13,277
You may not care,
but believe me...

218
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:15,029
I'm sorry, do you think
we're here to talk this out?

219
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:16,447
Sam, I can't just...

220
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:17,982
If you don't help us,

221
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:20,668
I will hunt you down and kill you.

222
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:23,905
Will you...

223
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:25,373
<i>boy?</i>

224
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,174
- How?
- I don't know yet.

225
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:30,778
But I will look until I find out,

226
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:32,130
and I don't sleep.

227
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,316
You need help, Sam.

228
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:37,251
I need <i>your</i> help.

229
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,009
You actually showed.

230
00:11:45,094 --> 00:11:48,295
Wow. Sam, I owe you
a chicken dinner.

231
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:49,681
What happened?

232
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:51,482
No big.

233
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,685
This is what friends
do for each other.

234
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:56,470
Huh.

235
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:02,810
It's not working.

236
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:04,946
Crowley's hidden from me.

237
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:09,283
Well, looks like we're gonna
have to try this the hard way.

238
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:38,029
Can I help you?

239
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:43,129
What do you want?

240
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:44,933
We want to know
where Crowley is.

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,751
If I even knew,
why would I tell you?

242
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,202
'Cause you're our grandfather.

243
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:52,123
Samuel, I'm gonna
get my soul back.

244
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:53,908
Who says you can get it back?

245
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,176
Me.

246
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,095
Look, I'd like to help,
but I'm sorry.

247
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,579
This is your grandson's soul.

248
00:12:58,631 --> 00:12:59,847
I can't!

249
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:02,917
What is wrong with you?

250
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:05,103
You <i>want to work for Crowley?</i>

251
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:09,157
Cass, can you give us a minute?

252
00:13:14,363 --> 00:13:17,281
We're your blood.

253
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:20,318
But if you don't want
to help us, I can't make you.

254
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:22,737
But I just got to know why.

255
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:25,490
What is Crowley
holding over you?

256
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:26,841
You owe us that.

257
00:13:47,513 --> 00:13:49,097
Mom?

258
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:51,766
He's gonna give her back to me.

259
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:55,653
Crowley's gonna bring mom
back from the dead?

260
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:57,638
You tell me
you don't want her back.

261
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:06,330
You know the one difference
between us?

262
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:09,333
You know how to live without her.

263
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:13,621
Look, I know how you feel.

264
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:14,822
No, you don't.

265
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:19,844
She's my daughter,
and she's dead.

266
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:21,796
And I can <i>do</i> something about it.

267
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:23,464
You really think Crowley's
gonna make good here?

268
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:25,633
He brought Sam back!
<i>And</i> me!

269
00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:28,936
Trust me...
don't go down that road.

270
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,004
What are you saying?

271
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:32,190
I'm saying stop trying.

272
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:34,976
It's gonna go nowhere good.

273
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:39,113
Samuel, I know
we've had our differences,

274
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:41,449
but I'm your grandson.

275
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,618
And I'm telling you

276
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,570
that this is wrong
for so many reasons.

277
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:48,355
- You hypocrite.
- I'm asking you to learn from our mistakes!

278
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:52,343
Doing this... this is how
the bad guy gets us <i>every</i> time!

279
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:54,045
It's our Achilles heel!

280
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:56,047
Apparently, it runs in the family.

281
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:04,889
We will figure
something else out.

282
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:06,007
Okay?

283
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,560
I'm sorry, Dean, but...

284
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:10,878
Fine.

285
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:13,014
Fine, you bring her back.

286
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:15,900
But what are you
gonna tell her, huh?

287
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:18,402
You gonna tell her
you made a deal with a demon?

288
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:21,721
- That you wouldn't help out her sons?!
- That's enough!

289
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,228
Just get out.

290
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:54,105
It's very complex.

291
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:56,724
Mm-hmm.

292
00:15:56,792 --> 00:16:00,311
If the pizza man
truly loves this babysitter...

293
00:16:02,264 --> 00:16:04,866
Why does he keep
slapping her rear?

294
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:07,618
Perhaps she's
done something wrong.

295
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:11,572
You're watching porn?

296
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:13,808
Why?

297
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,326
It was there.

298
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,499
You don't watch porn
in a room full of dudes.

299
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:24,068
And you don't... talk about it.

300
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:26,003
Just turn it off!

301
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,959
So, now he's got a boner.

302
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,667
Is this what you boys do?

303
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:58,819
Sit around
watching pornos with angels?

304
00:16:58,871 --> 00:17:01,255
I'm not supposed to
talk about it.

305
00:17:04,492 --> 00:17:06,993
Why you here, Samuel?

306
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:11,048
It's what Mary would want.

307
00:17:11,184 --> 00:17:14,135
Now, this is what I know.

308
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:17,939
Whatever we bag...
ends up there.

309
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:20,024
That's where he tortures them,
interrogates them...

310
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,359
I don't really know.

311
00:17:21,443 --> 00:17:24,061
Only been outside the place,
but it's a death trap.

312
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,347
Nothing gets in
that Crowley doesn't want in,

313
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:27,865
and nothing gets out...
period.

314
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,533
Well, thanks.

315
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,354
I wish you wouldn't do this.

316
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,909
Come with us.

317
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:46,433
I may be soft,
but I'm not suicidal.

318
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:02,900
Remember me?

319
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:06,020
I sure remember you, Clarence.

320
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:09,991
Why are we working
with these abominations?

321
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:12,559
Keep talking dirty.
It makes my meat-suit all dewy.

322
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:14,395
All right, simmer down.

323
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:16,230
We know where Crowley is.

324
00:18:16,281 --> 00:18:17,581
Great. Do tell.

325
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,001
Yeah, tell you so you can
just leave us for dead.

326
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:21,702
You boys have serious
abandonment issues,

327
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:22,787
you know that?

328
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:24,789
We'll show you, all right?

329
00:18:24,873 --> 00:18:26,173
But we're all going together.

330
00:18:26,241 --> 00:18:27,792
What, I'm just
supposed to trust you?

331
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:30,293
No. You're not that stupid.

332
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:32,763
Give me the knife for a minute.

333
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:35,099
No. I'm not that stupid.

334
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:36,934
Do you want us
to take you to Crowley or not?

335
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,320
You saw him.

336
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,105
He was more interested
in killing us,

337
00:18:58,156 --> 00:18:59,907
than getting the job done.

338
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,459
I just did all of us a favor!

339
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:07,715
Hey!

340
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:09,983
You just gonna keep that?

341
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:13,287
You took this from us.

342
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:14,922
I'm taking it back.

343
00:19:14,973 --> 00:19:17,308
We leave in one hour.

344
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,680
You know, Cass, you could help.

345
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:03,670
I'm ambivalent
about what we're attempting.

346
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:05,556
Well, breaking into
monster gitmo

347
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,858
is not exactly a two-for-one
in the champagne room.

348
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:11,445
I'm not sure retrieving
Sam's soul is wise.

349
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:17,201
Wait, what?

350
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:18,369
Why?

351
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:20,488
I want him to survive.

352
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,657
What are you talking about?

353
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,133
Sam's soul has been
locked in the cage

354
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,169
with Michael and Lucifer
for more than a year.

355
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,088
And they have <i>nothing</i> to do

356
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:39,723
but take their frustrations
out on him.

357
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,042
Do you understand?

358
00:20:42,094 --> 00:20:43,644
If we try to force

359
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:46,864
that mutilated thing
down Sam's gullet,

360
00:20:46,932 --> 00:20:48,933
we have no idea
what will happen.

361
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,435
- It could be catastrophic.
- You mean he dies.

362
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,703
I mean he <i>doesn't.</i>

363
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:56,223
Paralysis, insanity,

364
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:57,775
psychic pain so profound

365
00:20:57,859 --> 00:20:59,994
that he's locked inside himself
for the rest of his life.

366
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:03,364
But you're saying you don't
know anything for sure.

367
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:05,249
I mean, he <i>could</i> be fine.

368
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,401
- He could be, yes.
- Okay, then.

369
00:21:07,452 --> 00:21:09,203
But I sincerely doubt it.

370
00:21:09,254 --> 00:21:12,339
Well, if he's not fine,
then you fix him.

371
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:14,208
Dean, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

372
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:16,794
Then you figure it out, Cass!
Come on.

373
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:18,712
I mean, the guy's
a friggin' replicant.

374
00:21:18,763 --> 00:21:20,881
He needs his soul.

375
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:27,855
Look, we get it back.

376
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,224
And if there are complications,

377
00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:32,092
then we will figure out a way
to deal with those, too.

378
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:36,113
Of course.

379
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:44,405
Or we fail,

380
00:21:44,456 --> 00:21:46,207
and Sam suffers horrifically.

381
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,228
Seems pretty quiet.

382
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:10,865
It's not.
I can feel it.

383
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:12,850
Meet me at the side door.

384
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:19,823
This all seem
a little too easy to you?

385
00:22:19,908 --> 00:22:21,108
Way too easy.

386
00:22:57,696 --> 00:22:59,947
Is someone there?

387
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:01,398
Please.

388
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:03,284
Please help me.

389
00:23:06,238 --> 00:23:08,688
You got to get me out of here.

390
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:12,926
Please! You... you got to
get me out of here!

391
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:16,428
Come on, Dean.
We got to move.

392
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:31,595
Wait.

393
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,013
What is it?

394
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:42,022
Damn it.
Here come the guards.

395
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:46,610
Hell-hounds.

396
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,495
Go!

397
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,440
I knew this was a trap.

398
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:12,300
What do you want, a cupcake?

399
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,385
All right, that should keep them out.

400
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:15,937
Not for long.
How many of them are there?

401
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,188
Lots.

402
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,174
I'll be pulling for you...
from Cleveland.

403
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:21,442
- What?!
- I didn't know this was gonna happen.

404
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,361
Bright side...
them chewing up my meat-suit

405
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,996
ought to buy you a few seconds.

406
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:27,949
Seacrest out.

407
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,359
It's a spell, I think,
from Crowley.

408
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:40,795
Within these walls,
you're locked inside your body.

409
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,131
Karma's a bitch, bitch.

410
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,619
What are you gonna do,

411
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:51,139
you gonna slash thin air
until you hit something?

412
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,674
You can see them.

413
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,093
Take this. Hold them off.
It's our best shot.

414
00:24:56,845 --> 00:24:58,096
At Crowley.

415
00:24:58,147 --> 00:24:59,797
Take it and go.

416
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:02,684
You kill the smarmy dick.
I'll hold off the dogs.

417
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,185
How are you gonna do that I...

418
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,290
What was that?

419
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:31,346
I learned that
from the pizza man.

420
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,882
Well, A-plus for you.

421
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,467
I feel so... clean.

422
00:25:39,722 --> 00:25:41,389
Okay, gotta go.

423
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,107
Whoa, whoa, is that gonna work
on a hell-hound?

424
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,508
Well, we're about to find out.
Run!

425
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,893
I can't see Jack.

426
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,768
- Cass?!
- Dean.

427
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,406
You sold us out?

428
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:36,944
- Damn you Samuel!
- Yes.

429
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,163
And I have to say...

430
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,732
Best purchase I've made
since Dick Cheney.

431
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:42,750
Hiya, Crowley.

432
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,369
How's tricks?

433
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,254
Above your pay grade.

434
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,622
Been working.

435
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,207
Big things.

436
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:52,076
Alas, you'll be too dead
to participate.

437
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:53,711
Really?

438
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,596
Shame I have to
do away with you both.

439
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,800
Rather enjoyed
your indentured servitude.

440
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,312
Sam?!

441
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,930
Yeah?

442
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,685
I'm standing in pee.

443
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,189
Consider yourself lucky.

444
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:57,641
Yikes.

445
00:27:57,693 --> 00:27:59,277
That sucks.

446
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:06,834
You want forgiveness,
find a priest.

447
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,003
I just want you to understand.

448
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,322
Oh, I understand...

449
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:12,790
That you're a liar.

450
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:15,159
You talk about
putting <i>blood</i> first,

451
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,261
which is funny 'cause you sound
just like my dad.

452
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,662
Difference is, he actually did!

453
00:28:18,714 --> 00:28:19,931
I <i>am</i> putting blood first!

454
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,265
Oh, give me a break!

455
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,551
<i>Mary's</i> my blood!
My daughter!

456
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,636
Don't come at me
like I sold you out, Dean.

457
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,171
You sold out your own mother.

458
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:28,856
It was her or Sam,

459
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,841
and you chose Sam...
plain and simple.

460
00:28:30,893 --> 00:28:32,393
Oh, that is such crap!

461
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:33,694
You want to know
what really happened?

462
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,147
You chose a demon
over your own grandsons!

463
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:39,650
See it how you want.

464
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,654
I don't even know what Sam <i>is.</i>

465
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,573
And you want me to protect him?

466
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,209
And you?

467
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,911
You're a stranger.

468
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,163
No, really, tell me...

469
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:55,550
what <i>exactly</i> are you
supposed to be to me?

470
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,368
I'll tell you who I am.

471
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:01,538
I'm the guy
you never want to see again.

472
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,475
'Cause I'll make it
out of here. Trust me.

473
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,062
The next time you see me,

474
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,047
I'll be there to kill you.

475
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,186
Don't think
there's gonna be a next time.

476
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:17,021
Whatever gets you
through the night.

477
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,932
So...

478
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,435
Crowley wants to know...

479
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:08,322
Well, everything.

480
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,774
Told me to carve it out of you.

481
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:12,943
Whatever makes you
feel like a man.

482
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:18,282
Ha, ha.

483
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:23,954
You talk a mean game.

484
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:25,590
But, uh...

485
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,777
You're scared.

486
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,583
Enjoy.

487
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,471
All right, all right.

488
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,056
"Shawshank's" a great flick,

489
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,175
but let's skip
the shower scene, huh?

490
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:54,843
Look... breakfast.

491
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:03,288
What did you do with my brother?

492
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:06,058
Oh, you'll find out.

493
00:32:06,142 --> 00:32:07,726
You're about to join him.

494
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,884
Frickin' hate ghouls!

495
00:32:32,969 --> 00:32:34,853
Dean?!

496
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:37,089
Let me go,
you son of a bitch!

497
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:39,039
Dean!

498
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:49,518
Dean!

499
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,286
You know,
you're sticking that thing

500
00:33:08,371 --> 00:33:11,039
in all the wrong places.

501
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,574
Really?

502
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:16,428
You sure were squealing.

503
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:17,912
Knock yourself out.

504
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:19,247
It's a host body.

505
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:21,216
Some girl from Sheboygan,

506
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:23,719
moved to L.A. to be an actress.

507
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,587
It's probably not even
the worst thing

508
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:27,805
that ever happened to her.

509
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:43,954
What are you laughing at?

510
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:48,377
Dean Winchester's behind you...

511
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,661
Meat-sack.

512
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,787
We should go.

513
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,622
Hello, sweetheart.

514
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,641
Feeling chatty this morning,
are we?

515
00:34:25,948 --> 00:34:29,484
Do hope so.

516
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:32,821
Wouldn't want to harm a hair
on that pretty little head.

517
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:34,039
So...

518
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:37,459
You ready to tell me
all about your daddy?

519
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:45,667
Hold that thought.

520
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:06,186
You should be ghoul scat by now.

521
00:35:07,457 --> 00:35:08,990
Ohh.

522
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:17,048
Really necessary?

523
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:19,868
I just had this dry-cleaned.

524
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:26,007
So...

525
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:27,709
To what do I owe
the reach-around?

526
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:33,181
Crowley.

527
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:35,350
Whore.

528
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:38,236
Okay, you know what?

529
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,890
The best torturers
never get their hands dirty.

530
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:44,493
Sam wants a word with you.

531
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,245
What can I do for you, Sam?

532
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,781
You know damn well.

533
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:52,334
I want my soul back.

534
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,569
And here I thought you just
grew some balls, Sam.

535
00:35:55,955 --> 00:35:57,905
Well?

536
00:35:58,925 --> 00:36:00,292
- No.
- Meg?

537
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:11,052
I can't.

538
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:12,554
Can't or won't.

539
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:13,805
I said "can't".

540
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,525
And I meant can't,
you mop-headed lumberjack.

541
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:19,444
I was lucky to get
this much of you out.

542
00:36:19,529 --> 00:36:21,897
Going back in there
for the sloppy bits? No way.

543
00:36:21,948 --> 00:36:24,316
I'm good, but those two in there?

544
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,700
Forget it.

545
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,619
- How do I know you're not lying?
- You don't.

546
00:36:27,703 --> 00:36:29,871
But it doesn't change anything.

547
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:31,206
I'm telling you.

548
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:35,877
Sam, why do you want
the thing back?

549
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:40,899
Satan's got one juicy source
of entertainment in there.

550
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:43,501
I'd swallow a rag
off a bathhouse floor

551
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:45,286
before I took that soul.

552
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:48,089
Unless you <i>want</i>
<i>to be a drooling mess.</i>

553
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,842
Sam, I hate to say it,
but he's right.

554
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:53,228
Yeah, right. I get it. Thanks.

555
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,230
He's all yours.

556
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,000
Whoa. What are you, crazy?
He's our only hope!

557
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,267
Dean, you heard him.
He can't get it. He's useless!

558
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:15,849
You'll let me back out, right?

559
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,374
This is for Lucifer,
you pompous little...

560
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,984
That's better.

561
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:40,007
You don't know torture,
you little insect.

562
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,111
Leave them alone.

563
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,162
Castiel.

564
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:47,565
Haven't seen you all season.

565
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,900
You the cavalry now?

566
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,285
Put the knife down.

567
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,404
You that bossy in heaven?

568
00:37:52,488 --> 00:37:54,656
Hear you're losing out
to Raphael.

569
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:58,192
The whole affair makes Vietnam
look like a roller derby.

570
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,196
Hey, what's in the gift bag?

571
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:04,165
You are.

572
00:38:07,803 --> 00:38:08,887
Not possible.

573
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,258
You didn't hide your bones
as well as you should have.

574
00:38:19,982 --> 00:38:22,017
Cookie for you.

575
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:25,437
Can you restore
Sam's soul or not?

576
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:34,395
If I can help out
in any other...

577
00:38:34,447 --> 00:38:36,563
Answer him!

578
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:43,121
I can't.

579
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:23,004
Well, she's smart.
I'll give her that.

580
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:25,089
I was gonna kill her, too.

581
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:28,758
'Course, I'd have given you
an hour with her first.

582
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,328
Why would I want that?

583
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:35,983
Thanks, Cass.

584
00:39:36,051 --> 00:39:37,468
Hadn't have been for you...

585
00:39:41,273 --> 00:39:43,391
Crowley was right.
It's not...

586
00:39:43,475 --> 00:39:45,860
going well for me upstairs.

587
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,997
- If there's anything we can do...
- There isn't.

588
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:55,019
I wish circumstances
were different.

589
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:56,737
Much of the time...

590
00:39:56,805 --> 00:39:58,522
I'd rather be here.

591
00:39:58,574 --> 00:40:01,275
Look, Cass, we know you got
a steaming pile on your plate.

592
00:40:01,343 --> 00:40:02,543
There's no need for apologies.

593
00:40:02,628 --> 00:40:04,395
We're your friends.

594
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:07,548
Listen, Sam...

595
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:09,367
we'll find another way.

596
00:40:09,434 --> 00:40:10,835
You really want to help?

597
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:14,555
Prison full of monsters.

598
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,707
Can't just leave 'em,
can't let 'em go.

599
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:19,010
I understand.

600
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,350
He's right, you know.

601
00:40:26,418 --> 00:40:27,401
About?

602
00:40:27,486 --> 00:40:30,104
About your soul.

603
00:40:30,188 --> 00:40:32,740
We'll figure something else out.

604
00:40:32,824 --> 00:40:34,075
No, we won't.

605
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,226
Oh, why, because Crowley said...

606
00:40:36,278 --> 00:40:37,862
You <i>heard what Crowley said.</i>

607
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:39,413
And I heard what Cass said.

608
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:42,116
Putting this thing back in
would smash me to bits.

609
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,068
- We don't know that for sure.
- You know what?

610
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,704
When angels and demons
agree on something...

611
00:40:46,755 --> 00:40:48,589
call me nuts, I pay attention.

612
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:49,957
You say this <i>now?</i>

613
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:52,376
- After we practically died trying to...
- Exactly.

614
00:40:52,427 --> 00:40:54,178
We almost got ourselves killed!

615
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:56,714
I mean, how many times
do we risk our asses for this?

616
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:58,099
Enough's enough.

617
00:40:58,183 --> 00:41:00,601
- Sam...
- I don't think I want it back.

618
00:41:00,686 --> 00:41:02,019
You don't even know
what you're saying.

619
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:05,056
No, I'm saying something
you don't like.

620
00:41:07,192 --> 00:41:08,926
You obviously care a lot.

621
00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:11,329
But I think maybe
I'm better off without it.

622
00:41:11,396 --> 00:41:13,064
You're wrong.

623
00:41:13,115 --> 00:41:16,032
- You don't know how wrong you are.
- I'm not sure about that.

624
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:19,737
Sam, don't walk away.

625
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:22,106
Sam!

626
00:41:22,157 --> 00:41:23,240
Sam!
