1
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:06,671
- Now, you're <i>sure</i> it's vampires?
- Definitely.

2
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:09,957
Their Alpha's building an army.

3
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:11,092
We don't scare them anymore.

4
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:14,679
I'm your grandfather.

5
00:00:14,763 --> 00:00:16,314
Samuel?

6
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:17,682
We all thought you were dead.

7
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:19,850
We're guessing whatever
pulled Sam up pulled me down.

8
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:21,352
So, whatever this is,
we're both a part of it.

9
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:23,070
But you don't know what that is.

10
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:24,905
- Dean, you all right?
- It's Sam, Bobby.

11
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:26,941
He's just... he's different.
Something's not right to me.

12
00:00:26,992 --> 00:00:28,308
What is wrong with him?

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,111
I don't know, Dean.
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,449
It's like you <i>let</i> him get turned.

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,784
Get a man on the inside,

16
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:38,869
help us find that Alpha vamp
we've been looking for?

17
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:41,671
You think I'd do something
like that, risk my own brother?

18
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:43,507
You got my back.

19
00:00:43,592 --> 00:00:45,376
No matter what happens,
I can always count on you,

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,827
right, Sammy?

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:49,512
Yeah. Of course, Dean.

22
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:52,332
What are you? You're not human.

23
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:54,018
Please, just let me explain.

24
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:55,386
Why the hell should I believe
anything you say?

25
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,887
There's something wrong
with me, really wrong.

26
00:00:56,972 --> 00:00:58,389
I need help.

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,642
You're right. He looks terrible.

28
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:22,496
<i>You</i> did this?

29
00:01:27,052 --> 00:01:30,037
Cass?

30
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:32,840
What's...?
Let me go.

31
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:34,425
- Has he been feverish?
- Have you?

32
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:36,594
No. Why?

33
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:37,728
Is he speaking in tongues?

34
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:38,846
Are you speaking in tongues?

35
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:42,266
No. What are you...

36
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,901
are you diagnosing me?

37
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,152
You better hope he can.

38
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,437
You really think that this is...

39
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:48,105
What, you think that
there's a clinic out there

40
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,956
for people who just
pop out of Hell wrong?

41
00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:51,892
He asks, you answer,

42
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:53,411
then you shut your hole.
You got it?

43
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:58,248
How much do you sleep?

44
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:00,284
I don't.

45
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:02,420
At all?

46
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:04,521
Not since I got back.

47
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:07,908
And it never occurred to you

48
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,210
that there might be
something off about that?!

49
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:10,577
Of course it did, Dean.

50
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:15,049
I... I just never told you.

51
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,217
What?

52
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:18,252
Sam...

53
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:20,104
What are you feeling now?

54
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:23,057
I feel like my nose is broken.

55
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:25,760
No, that's a physical sensation.
How do you <i>feel?</i>

56
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:28,195
- Well, I think...
- Feel.

57
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:30,297
I... don't know.

58
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:37,771
What? Uh...

59
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:39,540
- This will be unpleasant.
- What...

60
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:41,325
Bite down on this.

61
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,577
If there's someplace
that you find soothing,

62
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:45,629
you should go there.

63
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:47,581
In your mind.

64
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:14,909
Did you find anything?

65
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:16,910
No.

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,830
So that's good news?

67
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:22,833
I'm afraid not.

68
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:26,337
Physically, he's perfectly healthy.

69
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:27,788
Then what?

70
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:31,175
It's his soul.

71
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:33,043
It's gone.

72
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:45,935
 Season 6 Episode 7
 "Family Matters"

73
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:51,111
Um...

74
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:53,981
I'm s... I'm sorry.
One more time, like I'm 5.

75
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,533
What do you mean, he's got no...

76
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:57,201
Somehow, when Sam was resurrected,

77
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,703
it was without his soul.

78
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,822
So, where is it?

79
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:03,857
My guess is...

80
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,710
Still in the cage
with Michael and Lucifer.

81
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:08,879
So, is he even still Sam?

82
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:14,335
Well, you pose an interesting
philosophical question.

83
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:15,636
Well, then, just get it back.

84
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:16,870
- Dean.
- Well, you pulled <i>me</i> out.

85
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:19,006
It took several angels to rescue you,

86
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:21,208
and you weren't
nearly as well guarded.

87
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:25,211
Sam's soul is in Lucifer's cage.
There's a difference, a big difference.

88
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,847
It's not possible.

89
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:28,215
Okay, well, there's got to be a way.

90
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,433
- So, are you gonna untie me?
- No.

91
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:30,884
- Listen, I'm not gonna...
- Sam, how am I even

92
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:32,886
supposed to let you
out of this room?

93
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:35,105
Dean, I'm not some psycho.

94
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,440
I didn't want you to get hurt.

95
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:38,442
I was just trying to stop the vamps.

96
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:43,047
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:45,032
It won't ever happen again.

98
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:47,618
Please let me go.

99
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:49,569
You're kidding, right?

100
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:51,338
Well, what are you gonna do, just
keep me locked up in here forever?

101
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:52,739
You say that like it's a bad thing.

102
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:56,126
Okay, fine. Look, I get it.
I get it, Dean. I was wrong.

103
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:59,296
But I'm telling you,
I... I'm trying to get right.

104
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:00,764
It's still me.

105
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,883
- Is it?
- Yes.

106
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:05,102
So just let me go.

107
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:06,804
No way in hell.

108
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,357
I didn't want it to come to this.

109
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:16,480
You're not gonna hold me, Dean...

110
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:19,483
not here, not in a panic room,
not anywhere.

111
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,869
You're stuck with the soulless guy,

112
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:24,604
so you might as well work with me.

113
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:26,707
Let's fix this.

114
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,461
I'm gonna be watching
every move you make.

115
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:32,012
Fine.

116
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,347
Sounds about right to me.

117
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,834
Cass, clean him up.

118
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:49,980
All right, if we're gonna figure out
what happened to your soul,

119
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:51,265
then we need to find
who yanked you out.

120
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,632
You say you don't know?

121
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:56,134
- No idea.
- Then we start a list.

122
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:58,272
If it's so hard to spring
someone out of the box,

123
00:05:58,323 --> 00:05:59,523
then who's got that kind of muscle?

124
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:01,742
I don't know.

125
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:05,946
You have no memory
of your resurrection?

126
00:06:05,997 --> 00:06:07,898
I woke up in a field.
That's all I got.

127
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,416
No clues? None?

128
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:14,405
I've got <i>one.</i>

129
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:34,508
Gramps throw a barbecue,
leave us off the e-vite list?

130
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:38,028
Sam!

131
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:39,063
Ahh.

132
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,784
- Dean.
- Hello, Newman.

133
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:46,120
Where's the man?

134
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:59,299
Come right on in.

135
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:02,353
Need to ask you a few questions.

136
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,921
What's wrong?

137
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,240
The day you got back,
what happened?

138
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,343
We've been over this.

139
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,311
Well, recap it for our wingman.

140
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:17,717
This Castiel?

141
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,754
You're scrawnier than I pictured.

142
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:22,206
This is a vessel.

143
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:24,391
My true form is approximately

144
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,560
the size of your Chrysler building.

145
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:28,495
All right, all right.
Quit bragging.

146
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:29,947
So, you were dead, and...

147
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:31,398
And, pow, I was on Elton Ridge.

148
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:33,566
Don't know how. Don't know why.

149
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:36,003
I got nothing to hide, guys.

150
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,955
Well, you mind if Cass here
double-checks?

151
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,600
Whoa!

152
00:07:49,684 --> 00:07:51,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's okay.

153
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,252
- It's okay.
- What the hell?

154
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:53,420
Angel cavity search.

155
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:55,189
I'm fine, Christian.
Just give us a minute.

156
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:56,273
But...

157
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:57,608
Just give us a minute.

158
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,221
What the hell was that about?

159
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:13,323
His soul is intact.

160
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:14,441
What?

161
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:18,045
Of course I have a...

162
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,669
What's going on, Sam?

163
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:28,338
Whatever dragged me out...

164
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:29,623
left a piece behind.

165
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:32,792
Did you know?

166
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:35,329
No, but I...

167
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:41,334
I knew it was something. I...

168
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:47,241
You're a hell of a hunter, Sam, but...

169
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:49,810
the truth is,
sometimes you scare me.

170
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:55,782
So, what's the deal here?
How do we fix this?

171
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,000
How do we get his soul back?

172
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:59,419
We don't know yet, but we have to.

173
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:02,538
Well, I'm here to help, of course.
What leads you working?

174
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:04,823
A bunch of dead ends and you.

175
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,044
Well, then, we'll just have to dig.

176
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:09,513
Sam, Dean...

177
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:11,048
I have to get back.

178
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:12,683
You're leaving?

179
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,519
I'm in the middle of a civil war.

180
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:17,971
You better tear the attic up,
find something to help Sam.

181
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:20,607
Of course. Your problems
always come first.

182
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:22,059
I'll be in touch.

183
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:32,352
Would've asked him
to stick around for a beer.

184
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:34,354
So, what's with
the book club outside?

185
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:39,793
Putting together a hunt.

186
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,878
That's a lot of guys for one hunt.

187
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,531
You found him, didn't you?

188
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:45,799
Who?

189
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:47,384
He's got a lead on the Alpha vamp.

190
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:48,585
Do you?

191
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,220
Maybe.

192
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:53,106
Yeah.

193
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:56,543
How'd you track him down?

194
00:09:58,146 --> 00:09:59,763
We're good.

195
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:03,481
- That's all I get? "We're good"?
- When's the run?

196
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:05,519
Dawn.

197
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,772
You didn't call me? Why?

198
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,060
'Cause of me.

199
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:16,196
You don't trust me very much,
do you?

200
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:17,781
Especially when it comes
to big game like this.

201
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:18,898
That's not true.

202
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,784
Okay. Well, then, we're in.

203
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:25,169
- No offense, but...
- So you <i>don't</i> trust me.

204
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:28,792
No, I just don't know you.

205
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,095
Not like I know Sam.

206
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:36,683
All right.

207
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,118
You call the plays.

208
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:40,938
100%.
I'm here to listen.

209
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:43,423
Since when?

210
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,642
Big daddy bloodsucker?

211
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:48,612
I ain't gonna miss that.

212
00:10:48,696 --> 00:10:49,947
But this is your deal.

213
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:51,598
Okay? I get it.

214
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,434
I'll follow your lead.
I trust <i>you.</i>

215
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,371
I don't trust him.

216
00:10:57,438 --> 00:10:59,272
Dude's hiding something.

217
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:00,774
- What?
- I can feel it.

218
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:02,776
And if you weren't Robo-Sam,
you'd feel it, too.

219
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:03,943
Huh.

220
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:05,111
What?

221
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:08,114
Just... you...

222
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,466
saying you don't trust family.

223
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:13,953
Look, we hang close, we blend
in, we see what we can pick up.

224
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:16,173
You think Samuel's connected
to this whole soul thing?

225
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:18,175
I still think he's
the only lead we got.

226
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:18,850
You lost, Dean?

227
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:22,456
Had to make a phone call.
Just needed some privacy.

228
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:24,207
Oh.

229
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:27,260
Samuel's locked office
is pretty private.

230
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:31,830
- Wasn't locked.
- Who you calling?

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,802
Your wife. Let her know I'm not
gonna make it over tonight.

232
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:40,340
You know, I've tried
playing nice, Dean,

233
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:42,392
- but I think I'm done.
- Wait, are you trying to tell me

234
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:44,394
that you're a bigger knob
than you've been letting on?

235
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,813
I'm the guy who's been here,
doing my job.

236
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:50,016
Who are you?
You think we need you here?

237
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:53,019
You walk around like
you're playing pro tennis.

238
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:54,404
Only action you seen lately

239
00:12:54,489 --> 00:12:56,239
is between your
slut girlfriend's legs.

240
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:02,946
You sure you want to come
with us tomorrow?

241
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,866
Accidents happen.

242
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,250
Hmm.

243
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:15,007
Don't worry, man. I got your back.

244
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:42,068
The house is just over the hill.

245
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,270
About a dozen vamps and the Alpha.

246
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,272
We got one shot at
this son of a bitch.

247
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,208
Christian, take flank.

248
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:50,210
The rest of you are with me and Sam.

249
00:13:50,277 --> 00:13:51,578
Dean, Gwen...

250
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:55,832
Hang back, sweep any stragglers
we flush out.

251
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:56,883
Problem, Dean?

252
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:58,718
No, sir.

253
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:01,471
I'm in the rear with the reject?

254
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,057
All right, let's go.

255
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:15,969
Don't worry. It's fine.

256
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,573
No, nothing's fine. You're not fine.

257
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,959
Go. Go.

258
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:36,122
Sorry about the "reject" thing.

259
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:38,341
Ah, I've been called worse.

260
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:40,844
Just, uh, get sick
of getting left behind.

261
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:43,180
Think it's probably
'cause I remind him

262
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:45,048
of his daughter or something.

263
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:47,601
Well, you do speak your mind.

264
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:52,820
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- You should.

265
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,715
You're welcome.

266
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,599
We're supposed to wait here!

267
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:17,057
Dean!

268
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,586
Sam!

269
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:43,535
- Careful, now!
- Yeah. Got him.

270
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:53,540
Alright, get him in there.

271
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,883
Get in.

272
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:02,883
Get him in there, strapped down...

273
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,144
Where were you?

274
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,681
Everything all right here?

275
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:20,639
Just, uh, chopped up a runner.
No big deal.

276
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,991
How'd it go?

277
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,476
Rough, but one Alpha down.

278
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:28,914
Where is it?

279
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,083
Want to pay my last respects.

280
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,036
Well, bring marshmallows.
Already on the pyre.

281
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,304
Things go okay back there?

282
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:53,672
Fine.

283
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:56,191
Nothing weird?

284
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:12,991
I saw you walk that Alpha
out the door, Sam.

285
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:14,877
Now, call me crazy...

286
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:17,296
But that seems weird.

287
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:22,284
Oh.

288
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,535
"Oh".

289
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:28,724
You weren't supposed to
know about that.

290
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,976
- Know what?
- It's just something Samuel's been doing.

291
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,095
Catching things,
taking them somewhere,

292
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,430
grilling them for info.

293
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:35,714
Grill.

294
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,550
Torture, right?

295
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:40,819
And not telling me...
that was his idea?

296
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,421
No, it was mine.

297
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,725
Why?

298
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:50,245
Honestly?

299
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:52,780
'Cause you'd mess it up.

300
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,233
You shoot first,
ask questions later,

301
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:58,819
and we needed to ask questions.

302
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:04,593
You know, I... I don't care
if you've got soullessness

303
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,545
or the freakin' mumps, man...

304
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:07,930
You know better than this!

305
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:09,348
Do you even want your soul back?

306
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,883
How does that have anything to do...

307
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,885
have you been to the place
where Samuel takes them?

308
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:15,754
I mean, have you been in
on these interrogations?

309
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:16,889
No, but I hear...

310
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,308
And what does he want? And why?

311
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:23,643
And did it ever occur to you
that this is <i>really</i> shady?

312
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,116
He's our grandfather.

313
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,450
Yeah.

314
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,152
Yeah, a guy who talks a great game.

315
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:33,622
But you can't assume
that family means

316
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,407
the same thing to him
as it does to us.

317
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,692
He's not dad.

318
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:41,046
Wow.

319
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,748
- You don't see it, do you?
- What?

320
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,384
You've got no instinct.

321
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,453
I mean, you are seriously messed up.

322
00:19:48,505 --> 00:19:50,889
- Thanks.
- I'm not kidding, man.

323
00:19:54,978 --> 00:19:58,480
Nobody's forcing you
to work with me, okay?

324
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,849
But if we do this...

325
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,969
I drive the bus, I call the shots,

326
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,237
and you tell me everything,

327
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,972
whether you think
it's important or not,

328
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:10,491
because, trust me...
you can't tell the difference.

329
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:15,647
Or, you know what, go...
go with Samuel.

330
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:17,749
See how that goes.

331
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,334
It's up to you.

332
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:35,165
Samuel?

333
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:37,019
Damn, kid. Learn how to knock.

334
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,439
Where's your brother?

335
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,358
Gone.

336
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:44,810
What do you mean, "gone"?

337
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:47,012
I mean he left about an hour ago.

338
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:49,898
He and I just weren't
seeing eye-to-eye anymore

339
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,233
I guess.

340
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,572
That's too bad.

341
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,374
I want in.

342
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,460
In?

343
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,378
On the interrogations,
on everything.

344
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,330
I can help.

345
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,716
This family...
this is it for me now.

346
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:08,917
Whatever you need, I'll do.

347
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:10,335
- Yeah, I know you will.
- Great.

348
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:13,222
But until we can figure out
this soul business of yours,

349
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,939
I need you to keep doing
what you're doing.

350
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:17,926
But I can...

351
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,895
No. You can't.

352
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,284
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,237
Right.

354
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,425
Hey.

355
00:22:07,477 --> 00:22:09,427
You didn't think I'd come back.

356
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:12,480
I figured 60/40.

357
00:22:14,284 --> 00:22:16,785
So, Samuel didn't take the bait.

358
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,121
So I went with plan "B".

359
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,406
We had a plan "B"?

360
00:22:21,457 --> 00:22:23,875
Fired up the GPS
on one of his cellphones.

361
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,577
We should be able to track him
right to the Alpha.

362
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,612
- The old man won't notice?
- Trust me.

363
00:22:27,664 --> 00:22:29,348
He thinks Velcro is big news.

364
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:33,467
There. Got him.

365
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:20,382
Dead man's blood?

366
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,184
Smart.

367
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:25,020
Lock the place down
with vamp repellent.

368
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,701
Where is it?

369
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,439
Answer the question.

370
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:11,542
Where is it? How do we find it?

371
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:24,122
Ouch. Stop. That hurts.

372
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,062
Now, this...

373
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,766
this is Club Med compared to
what we have planned for you.

374
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:37,319
- Oh.
- I got... I got all the time in the world.

375
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:40,155
Well, that makes two of us.

376
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,161
Are you two going to hide all night?

377
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:07,182
Come on out, boys.

378
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,787
How can I help you?

379
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:39,711
We got some questions
for you, Skippy,

380
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:42,080
since you're going nowhere fast.

381
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,117
Don't be so sure.

382
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:49,804
Yeah?
Locked down pretty tight.

383
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:52,373
And with all that dead blood
rushing through your veins,

384
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,826
not sure you got enough juice

385
00:26:54,894 --> 00:26:57,162
to fire up that psychic
bat-signal of yours, do you?

386
00:26:57,229 --> 00:26:58,346
True.

387
00:26:58,414 --> 00:27:02,283
Not near enough juice for that...

388
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:04,169
Dean.

389
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:08,790
I didn't realize
we were on a first-name basis.

390
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:10,291
Of course we are.

391
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:13,695
After all, you were my child...

392
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:15,663
for a time.

393
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:18,016
Dean, tell me...

394
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,501
Did you enjoy it?

395
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:25,523
I'm asking the questions here,
fright night.

396
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,063
When your kind first
huddled around the fire,

397
00:27:32,147 --> 00:27:34,315
I was the thing in the dark!

398
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:39,353
Now you think you can hurt me?

399
00:27:43,191 --> 00:27:47,327
I have all night, boys.
<i>You</i> do not.

400
00:27:50,216 --> 00:27:53,918
Anyway, I'm happy to tell you
whatever you want to know.

401
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:55,053
Why?

402
00:27:55,137 --> 00:27:56,421
Why?

403
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:59,724
Because soon, I'll be
ankle-deep in your blood,

404
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,709
sucking the marrow from your bones.

405
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,147
So you're really it.

406
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:08,883
The first of your species.

407
00:28:10,185 --> 00:28:11,385
The very first.

408
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:14,221
But if you're the first...

409
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:15,923
who made you?

410
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:21,228
Well, we all have our mothers.

411
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,081
Even me.

412
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:25,750
What does that mean?

413
00:28:28,871 --> 00:28:30,872
And what's with the big surge
of vamps lately?

414
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:32,173
I mean, it's like...

415
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,508
Like we're going to war.

416
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:37,045
Why? What's going on?
Why did Samuel bring you here?

417
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:41,683
You smell cold.

418
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:48,422
You have no soul.

419
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:51,059
What an oddity.

420
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,594
Do you feel how empty you are?

421
00:28:53,646 --> 00:28:55,763
What is it like to have no soul?

422
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:57,282
- Answer my question.
- You first.

423
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:58,733
You're the one in the cage.

424
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:00,401
The thing about souls,

425
00:29:00,502 --> 00:29:02,436
if you've got one, of course...

426
00:29:02,488 --> 00:29:04,789
is they're predictable.

427
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:06,958
You die, you go up or down.

428
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:08,793
Where do my kind go?

429
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:10,545
All right, enough with
the sermon, freak.

430
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:11,913
I'm trying to answer the question.

431
00:29:11,964 --> 00:29:15,500
Now, when we "freaks" die...

432
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:17,251
Where do we go?

433
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:21,622
Not Heaven, not Hell.

434
00:29:21,674 --> 00:29:22,957
So?

435
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:25,059
Legoland?

436
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:29,463
Little rusty on our Dante, boys?

437
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:32,917
Purgatory.

438
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,322
Purgatory? Purgatory's real?

439
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:40,325
Oh, stupid cattle.

440
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:42,744
Of course!

441
00:29:42,811 --> 00:29:45,813
And it is filled with the soul
of every hungry thing like me

442
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:47,815
that ever walked this Earth.

443
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:51,452
Now, <i>where</i> is it?
<i>That</i> is the mystery.

444
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:54,655
And that is what
your kindhearted granddaddy

445
00:29:54,707 --> 00:29:57,658
is trying to beat out of me.

446
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,828
Samuel brought you here...

447
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:02,380
To find out where Purgatory is?

448
00:30:02,464 --> 00:30:05,016
I keep telling him...
How would I know such a thing?

449
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,635
But he refuses to untie me.

450
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,003
You know exactly where it is.

451
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:12,890
Why does Samuel care
about any of this?

452
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:14,726
He doesn't care.

453
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:18,679
He does as he is told.

454
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:24,185
Well, if the old man's Kermit...

455
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:27,321
Whose hand's up his ass?

456
00:30:32,211 --> 00:30:33,711
Evening, guys.

457
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:38,066
Wow, you know, I have seen
some stupid in my time,

458
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:40,668
but you take the crown.

459
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:43,221
Putting jaws in a fishbowl?

460
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:44,639
How do you think that's gonna end?

461
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:46,591
I don't know what kind of game
you're running...

462
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:48,476
What, do you think
I'm doing this for kicks?

463
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:50,978
I think you got the rest of these feebs
convinced that you're John Wayne.

464
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:53,564
So whatever you're doing,
whatever you're hiding...

465
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:57,234
It's gonna put you and everyone
around you in the ground.

466
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:05,493
Hi.

467
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,612
Gwen.

468
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:13,901
And I thought we had
something special.

469
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:22,576
Are you scared of me?

470
00:31:22,628 --> 00:31:24,595
I would be.

471
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:33,805
Go ahead.

472
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:50,788
Grab your stuff.

473
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:15,788
How much dead mans
blood we got left?

474
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:22,363
How long till the Alpha's 100%?

475
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,264
Hour. Maybe less.

476
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:26,200
We need to get him dosed up
and back in the cage.

477
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:26,984
No.

478
00:32:28,353 --> 00:32:30,754
What do you mean, "no"?

479
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:32,265
I mean, I don't know
what your big plan was,

480
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,390
but playing catch
is not on the table.

481
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:34,558
- Dean...
- We take the thing's head off,

482
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,661
or it kills us all!
You know that.

483
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:43,167
Okay.

484
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:44,902
We split up. Clear every room.

485
00:32:44,953 --> 00:32:47,088
You get a shot, you take it.

486
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:49,790
It's not gonna kill him, but dude will move
a lot slower without any kneecaps.

487
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,959
And if we make it through this,
you, me, and Sam

488
00:32:52,044 --> 00:32:53,711
are having one hell
of a family meeting.

489
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:04,031
You think he ran out?

490
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,584
No!

491
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:17,261
The boy with no soul.

492
00:34:17,328 --> 00:34:18,996
I've got big plans for you.

493
00:34:19,047 --> 00:34:21,799
It's amazing how that pesky,
little soul gets in the way.

494
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,934
But not for you.

495
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:26,971
You will be the perfect...

496
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:28,338
animal.

497
00:34:36,347 --> 00:34:37,314
Christian?

498
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:55,633
Well, that was dramatic.

499
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,967
Crowley?

500
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:59,503
Hello, boys.

501
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:01,205
What an unexpected treat.

502
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:03,640
Bring Christian back now.

503
00:35:04,426 --> 00:35:06,260
- I'm sorry?
- My nephew!

504
00:35:06,344 --> 00:35:08,145
The one you just
crammed a demon into!

505
00:35:08,213 --> 00:35:11,048
Oh, no. I had him possessed
ages ago.

506
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,850
Samuel, really.

507
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:15,920
I keep an eye on my investments.

508
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:18,773
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
You two know each other?

509
00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:20,057
Not in the biblical sense.

510
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:22,109
More of a business
relationship, I'd say.

511
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,032
You're Crowley's bitch.

512
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,533
It's not what you think.

513
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:31,235
It's precisely what you think.

514
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:34,588
That Alpha he's caught me
is getting him a gold star.

515
00:35:34,673 --> 00:35:37,258
Since when do you give a crap
about vampires?

516
00:35:37,342 --> 00:35:40,077
Since, uh...

517
00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:42,913
What's today... Friday?

518
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:46,583
Since, let's see...
mind your business.

519
00:35:46,635 --> 00:35:49,386
You may as well share
with the class, Crowley.

520
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:53,090
We know you're looking
for Purgatory.

521
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:54,775
So you heard about that?

522
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,061
Yeah. You want to tell us why?

523
00:35:57,112 --> 00:35:58,612
Isn't it obvious?

524
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:01,315
Location, location, location.

525
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:03,534
I'm a developer.

526
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,069
Purgatory is vast,

527
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,487
underutilized, and Hell-adjacent,

528
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:07,872
and I want it.

529
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:09,790
- What for?
- Best shut your gob.

530
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,459
Employees don't question
management.

531
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:13,944
- We ain't your employees.
- Of course you are!

532
00:36:13,995 --> 00:36:16,713
Have been for some time now,
thanks to gramps.

533
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:21,118
I don't keep Captain Chromedome
around for his wit, do I?

534
00:36:22,971 --> 00:36:25,673
Samuel knows things.

535
00:36:25,757 --> 00:36:27,258
More than any of you, actually.

536
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:29,477
Walking encyclopedia of
the creepy and the crawly.

537
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:31,061
And I knew...

538
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:35,850
you two are so hung up
on family-loyalty nonsense,

539
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:38,435
he said jump, you'd get froggy.

540
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:41,522
Yeah, well, the game's over.

541
00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:42,940
Yeah, well, afraid not,

542
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:45,692
not if you want to see
Sam's soul ever again.

543
00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:48,812
You're bluffing.

544
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,817
Tell them, Samuel.

545
00:36:56,988 --> 00:36:59,540
He pulled us both back, me and Sam.

546
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:02,159
What? You knew?

547
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,761
No, Cass says it takes big-time mojo

548
00:37:03,828 --> 00:37:05,045
to pull something like that off,

549
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,047
and you're nothing but
a punk-ass crossroads demon.

550
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:08,999
<i>Was</i> a punk-ass
crossroads demon.

551
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,602
Now? King of Hell.

552
00:37:11,669 --> 00:37:13,287
Believe me, I've got the mojo.

553
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:15,973
I snap my fingers,
Sam gets his soul back.

554
00:37:16,024 --> 00:37:20,344
Or you can be... you,

555
00:37:20,395 --> 00:37:23,447
and I shove Sam
right back in the hole.

556
00:37:23,514 --> 00:37:26,700
Can't imagine what
it's like in there...

557
00:37:26,785 --> 00:37:29,119
And I can imagine so many things.

558
00:37:30,488 --> 00:37:33,457
So, we clear?

559
00:37:33,524 --> 00:37:35,409
Me, Charlie... you, Angels.

560
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:40,965
Job's simple enough...
Bring me creatures.

561
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:44,185
Aim high on the food chain, please.

562
00:37:44,252 --> 00:37:46,369
Everybody wins.

563
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:49,806
It's been a pleasure.
See you soon.

564
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:04,164
It's time to go. Get the van.

565
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,371
You're letting a demon call the shots?

566
00:38:08,422 --> 00:38:10,239
Nothing's changed.

567
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,907
We hunt. Period.

568
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,345
Don't worry about him.
We'll take care of it.

569
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:22,500
You trust me or not?

570
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:24,586
Get the van, Gwen.

571
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,231
Working with a demon, huh?

572
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,100
You're not who I thought you were.

573
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:40,219
You don't know anything
about me, son.

574
00:38:41,972 --> 00:38:44,040
So, what's so important

575
00:38:44,107 --> 00:38:46,258
that you're the king of hell's
cabana boy, huh?

576
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,961
What'd he offer you?
Girls? Money? Hair?

577
00:38:49,046 --> 00:38:52,114
I got my reasons.

578
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,754
You gonna make a move, go ahead.

579
00:38:58,805 --> 00:38:59,722
Or what?

580
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:01,724
Or nothing.

581
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:03,292
I'm not gonna do anything
to you, Dean.

582
00:39:04,794 --> 00:39:05,928
You boys...

583
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,765
you're my family.

584
00:39:11,468 --> 00:39:13,652
So the way I see it,
you got two choices...

585
00:39:13,737 --> 00:39:16,105
put a bullet in your grandfather
or step aside.

586
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,477
He sold us out.

587
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,162
I know.

588
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:24,563
Let it go.

589
00:39:24,631 --> 00:39:26,449
Why?

590
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:34,590
Get out of here.

591
00:39:48,438 --> 00:39:49,505
So, what now?

592
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,507
We can't work for Crowley.

593
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,059
Are you sure about that?

594
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,061
I don't think you understand.
Demons bone you every time.

595
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:57,980
Oh, no, I get it. I do, believe me.

596
00:39:58,031 --> 00:39:59,281
Just running the math...

597
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:01,033
do we really have another choice?

598
00:40:01,118 --> 00:40:04,318
- We could stab him in his throat.
- And get my soul back how?

599
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:06,872
I'm just saying,
seems like we got to play ball,

600
00:40:06,957 --> 00:40:08,174
at least for the moment.

601
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:12,328
I have done some stupid things
in my time,

602
00:40:12,379 --> 00:40:15,297
but punching a demon's clock?

603
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:18,700
Look, just till we find another way.

604
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:20,553
And then?

605
00:40:20,637 --> 00:40:23,222
And then we track Crowley down

606
00:40:23,306 --> 00:40:25,174
and give that son of a bitch
what's coming to him.

607
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:30,712
You with me, Dean?
