1
00:00:02,462 --> 00:00:04,405
Hello, Dean.
What is it you want?

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:05,505
Lucifer's cage.

3
00:00:05,561 --> 00:00:07,237
Sam's soul
is stuck in that box.

4
00:00:07,386 --> 00:00:10,599
I can't erase Sam's Hell,
but I can put it behind a wall.

5
00:00:10,723 --> 00:00:12,119
Nasty, those memories.

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,649
You don't want to know
what they will do to him

7
00:00:18,294 --> 00:00:19,745
Death said he can put up a wall.

8
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,363
But you wouldn't remember Hell.

9
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:23,937
- Don't do this.
- Don't scratch the wall.

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,158
You should have told me, Dean.

11
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:30,210
- You weren't supposed to know.
- What I did?

12
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:32,246
To Bobby? To you?

13
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:33,881
Of course I should know.

14
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:37,000
Sam, Death didn't just shove
your soul back in, okay?

15
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:38,969
He put up the great wall of Sam

16
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:40,387
between you and the things
that you don't remember.

17
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:41,672
And trust me when I say

18
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:43,807
that the things you don't know
could kill you.

19
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:45,676
- That's not a joke.
- But I have to set things right.

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,961
So I need to know what I did.

21
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:49,897
But you don't know how dangerous
that could be.

22
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:52,850
I warned you not to put
that thing back inside him.

23
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:54,634
What was I supposed to do?

24
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:58,272
Let me tell you what his soul
felt like when I touched it.

25
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:00,991
Like it had been
skinned alive, Dean.

26
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:02,809
If you wanted to kill
your brother,

27
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:04,445
you should have done it
outright.

28
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:43,033
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:44,151
How's the arm?

30
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:45,953
It'll hold
till we get out of town.

31
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,704
Just don't bleed out,
all right?

32
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:50,072
Yeah, well, that's the plan.

33
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:05,589
Cop.

34
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:29,913
Evening, Deputy.

35
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:31,281
Agent Roark, Agent Wynand,

36
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:33,866
mind stepping out of the van
a moment?

37
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:38,088
We're just on our way
to the office.

38
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:39,506
Everything okay?

39
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:41,925
No. I can't get
Sheriff Dobbs on the phone.

40
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,343
I can't get <i>anyone!</i>

41
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,411
We spoke to Dobbs earlier.
Maybe he's just, uh...

42
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:45,629
is that blood?

43
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:51,351
Hey, look, there's no need
to get riled.

44
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,253
You're coming with me.
All right.

45
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:54,588
We'll follow you back.

46
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,223
I don't think so.

47
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:58,475
Get in my car,
or you're under arrest.

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,260
You're gonna arrest
two federal agents?

49
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:02,696
Really?

50
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:05,399
Have a good night.

51
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,817
If you think...

52
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:08,368
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, just hold...

53
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:31,391
You think there were
maybe calmer ways

54
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,626
- we could have done all that?
- Do we care?

55
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:37,130
Let's go.

56
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:58,417
Season 6 Episode 12
    "Unforgiven"

57
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:03,349
<i>Sources said</i>

58
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:05,871
<i>prosecutors were getting closer</i>
<i>to a decision</i>

59
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,590
<i>on whether to charge the actor.</i>

60
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:09,475
<i>But they adamantly denied that</i>
<i>any prosecution was in any...</i>

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,477
What are you watching?

62
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:13,146
Just trying to catch up.
So...

63
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,265
Mel Gibson really took
a turn this past year, huh?

64
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:18,084
Or he's possessed.

65
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:20,403
Seriously, think about it.

66
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:22,655
So, I just got off the blower
with Bobby.

67
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,207
Oh, yeah?

68
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:26,409
You got anything else on this,
uh, "mother of all" thing?

69
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,328
Uh, no, nothing solid.

70
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,046
He says it's quiet.

71
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,168
Quiet like quiet
or quiet like too quiet?

72
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:36,753
When is it ever just quiet?

73
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:38,638
Right.

74
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:43,292
- Hmm.
- What?

75
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:50,016
What are these, coordinates?
Who's it from?

76
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,684
I have no idea.

77
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:01,494
Well?

78
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:03,329
Uh, Bristol, Rhode island,

79
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:06,482
where three women disappeared
in the last week.

80
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:11,120
Apparently, the, uh, victims
seemed to vanish into thin air.

81
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:14,257
Could be something.
Who's the text from?

82
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:15,541
I don't know.
It just kept ringing.

83
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:17,760
- What's that about?
- Could be another hunter

84
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:19,712
looking for backup,
throwing us a case?

85
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:21,631
Who knows how many hunters
I even met,

86
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:23,383
working with the Campbells,
you know?

87
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:24,667
But I think we should go.

88
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:26,719
Whoa, wait. We're just
gonna drop everything?

89
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:28,855
Dude, two minutes ago,
you weren't doing <i>anything.</i>

90
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:31,810
You got mysterious coordinates

91
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:34,610
from a mysterious Mr. "X,"
leading to a mysterious town?

92
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:36,562
That doesn't throw up
red flags to you?

93
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:38,514
I don't know. Maybe.

94
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:40,450
But that doesn't mean we can just ignore
a bunch of missing girls.

95
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:43,736
Right?

96
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:47,623
Okay.
We'll check it out.

97
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:50,209
But if things get squirrelly,
we dump out, okay?

98
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:52,193
Yeah.

99
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:19,821
What?

100
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:22,325
Nothing.

101
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,838
Well, freak's got a type...
brunettes.

102
00:06:35,906 --> 00:06:37,740
Whoa.

103
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,625
This one's got a little bit
of a wild side.

104
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,012
It's all in the eyes, Sam.

105
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,514
See it?

106
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:47,133
All right, well, aside from
your little deep insight there,

107
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:49,302
these women actually
have nothing in common...

108
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:52,555
Different jobs, different friends,
different <i>everything.</i>

109
00:06:52,606 --> 00:06:53,890
So, what's the connection?

110
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:55,858
I don't know.
Why don't you figure that out?

111
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:57,760
I'm gonna go hit the poop deck.

112
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:11,791
Agent Roark?

113
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:16,046
- It's good to see you again.
- It is.

114
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:18,381
Oh, you remember my husband?

115
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:20,299
Right.

116
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:22,635
- Don.
- Of course, right. Um, hi.

117
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:25,454
So...

118
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:29,458
you're back 'cause it started again,
right... the disappearances?

119
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:33,846
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, right.

120
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:36,966
Um... so, if either of you two
hear anything,

121
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:38,401
please let me know.

122
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:55,751
Where's your partner?

123
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,671
The big bald guy?

124
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:00,706
Agent Wynand, right?

125
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,159
- Agent Wynand, of course. Well...
- Sex rehab.

126
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,212
Yeah, you've heard
of plushies, right?

127
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:08,014
This is, uh...
this is my new partner.

128
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:09,182
Hi. Pleasure.

129
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:12,185
How you doing? Hi.

130
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:14,554
Uh, so, agent,
we should, uh

131
00:08:14,638 --> 00:08:16,105
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

132
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:19,442
Of course. Uh, nice chatting
with you, Agent Roark.

133
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:22,111
You too.

134
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:31,903
Cuff me.

135
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:36,075
What was that?

136
00:08:37,411 --> 00:08:39,628
She just cougar-eyed you.

137
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:42,915
I think Samuel and I
have worked a case in this town.

138
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:46,301
You think?

139
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:54,726
Come on. Let's get the hell
out of here.

140
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:01,601
Hey, come on.
Hop to, would you?

141
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:03,819
We can't go, Dean.

142
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,988
Uh, yeah, we can.

143
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:08,407
No, listen... five guys
went missing a year ago.

144
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:09,942
They never found the bodies.

145
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:12,245
I mean, that's got to be the job
me and Samuel worked, right?

146
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:13,946
Great. What difference
does it make?

147
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,865
A year ago,
five guys go missing,

148
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,084
and... and now suddenly
all these women go missing.

149
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:19,785
Something's here.

150
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,371
So either we just didn't stop it,

151
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:24,740
or we only <i>thought</i> we did.

152
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,093
Okay, but why
the gender bend, huh?

153
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:29,295
First it's dudes.
Now it's chicks?

154
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:30,746
That's a totally different M.O.

155
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:31,931
I don't know.
Who knows?

156
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:33,549
The point is,
something's still here.

157
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,384
Great. Well, call Bobby.
He can deal with it.

158
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:36,602
Why? <i>We</i> can deal with it.

159
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:38,271
Are you serious?

160
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:39,755
Sam, there is a reason

161
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:42,858
that hunters don't hit
the same town over again...

162
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:44,961
'cause we have a habit
of leaving messes behind.

163
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:47,196
- Right. I agree.
- One of dad's rules...

164
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:49,398
you never use
the same crapper twice.

165
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:51,701
- <i>Everyone</i> uses the same crapper twice.
- Not us.

166
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:54,320
You know what I mean.

167
00:09:54,404 --> 00:09:55,771
Okay, look...

168
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:58,274
this creature is still walking
around 'cause of me, right?

169
00:09:58,325 --> 00:09:59,492
I mean, <i>I</i> let it go.

170
00:09:59,576 --> 00:10:01,327
Dad also said,
"you finish what you start."

171
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:04,547
Okay, I get it.

172
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:06,165
- Do you?
- Yes.

173
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,384
You're afraid
I'll stroll down memory lane

174
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:10,586
and I'll kick this wall
in my head so hard,

175
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:12,088
hell comes flooding through,
right?

176
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:13,806
And then all of a sudden,
I'm some drooling mess on the floor.

177
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:14,957
It's not a joke.

178
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:17,626
Okay. I know.

179
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:21,314
But listen... what's happening
here right now...

180
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:24,350
it's because <i>I</i> messed up somehow,

181
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:25,968
in some big way.

182
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:29,322
So every person who gets taken,
every person who dies...

183
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:30,773
that's on me.

184
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:33,409
I have to stop it.

185
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:35,795
And you'd do the same thing.

186
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:42,868
All right.

187
00:10:42,953 --> 00:10:44,620
I'll follow up
with the brunettes.

188
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,372
You see what you get
from the cops.

189
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:49,792
So, you and Nicole were
roommates for a long time.

190
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:52,161
Since college, but we've been
best friends forever.

191
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:53,329
Hmm.

192
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,930
This whole thing's
really surreal.

193
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:59,135
Are you any closer
to finding her, or...?

194
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:00,770
We're doing everything we can.

195
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:07,509
Now, you were with Nicole
the night she went missing.

196
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,478
Did she say anything?

197
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,147
Nothing.

198
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:13,182
It's like I told the cops...

199
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:14,817
I wish there was something.

200
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,028
Where'd you get this?

201
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,897
Oh, Nicole got that
from that FBI guy.

202
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:30,249
Agent Roark.

203
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:32,001
About... about yea high?

204
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:33,502
Yeah, that was him.

205
00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:35,755
One of the men
that disappeared last year

206
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,306
lived in our building.

207
00:11:37,374 --> 00:11:39,225
Right.

208
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:42,178
So Agent Roark was asking us
all questions about it, I guess.

209
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:43,179
You guess?

210
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,348
So he... he came by here?

211
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,317
Oh, he came by a few times.

212
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,604
Did he?

213
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:53,439
To, uh...

214
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:55,074
speak to Nicole.

215
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:56,909
Right.

216
00:11:56,993 --> 00:11:59,945
And how would you...

217
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,664
characterize
their relationship?

218
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:03,699
Relationship?
No, they weren't having a...

219
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,034
Just the... the... the tone

220
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:06,852
or the nature
of their conversation.

221
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:10,673
Well... loud...

222
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:14,176
and...

223
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:16,796
athletic.

224
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:33,762
Hold it right there!

225
00:12:33,814 --> 00:12:34,780
Stop right there!

226
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,400
Hands where I can see them!

227
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:39,568
Get in my car,
or you're under arrest.

228
00:12:44,574 --> 00:12:46,041
Look... no, sir.

229
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:47,376
Please just hold on
for a second.

230
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:48,828
There's been
a misunderstanding here.

231
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:59,455
Man, you are dumb
as a sack of hair...

232
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,957
coming back here
after what you did?

233
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:03,926
Look, there's been
a misunderstanding here.

234
00:13:03,977 --> 00:13:05,761
You are not a damn agent, okay?

235
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:07,813
- The FBI never heard of you.
- Just listen.

236
00:13:07,898 --> 00:13:09,465
Where are the bodies?

237
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:12,351
Mothers want to bury
their loved ones.

238
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:13,569
I don't know.

239
00:13:13,636 --> 00:13:14,854
Where's Sheriff Dobbs?

240
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:16,272
I don't know.

241
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:19,658
You run out of town
soaked in blood...

242
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,112
Oh, and you bash my <i>brains</i> in
to do it...

243
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:24,663
and you really expect me
to buy that?

244
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:29,201
Look, would you believe that
I don't remember anything?

245
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:30,319
No.

246
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,538
But good luck
selling it to the judge.

247
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:03,702
What happened to my husband?

248
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:10,326
Look, I... I don't know.

249
00:14:10,393 --> 00:14:11,660
Don't lie to me.

250
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,579
I know who you are, Sam.

251
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:15,097
I know what you do.

252
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:17,166
What?

253
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:20,286
You do?

254
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:31,046
Let me get this straight...
you're not feds.

255
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:34,066
You actually hunt things.

256
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,018
- We know how it sounds.
- I'm not sure you do.

257
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:37,686
You saw
those crime scenes, Roy.

258
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:40,389
You really think something <i>human</i>
<i>could have taken those guys?</i>

259
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,774
What you're saying...
it's impossible.

260
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:43,892
You know, I'm sorry,
I... I don't understand

261
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:45,361
what she's got to do
with any of this.

262
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:48,830
She's my wife.

263
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:54,286
She works with me
at the sheriff's station.

264
00:14:54,371 --> 00:14:57,038
You tell something like this to me,
you tell it to her, too.

265
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:01,827
All right,
what do you need us to do?

266
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:07,916
Your husband...
he's the sheriff.

267
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:10,886
<i>Was</i> the sheriff,
until he vanished...

268
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:12,304
And <i>you</i> vanished.

269
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,423
What was I supposed to think?

270
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:17,526
T... that <i>thing</i> got him,
or that <i>you</i> killed him?

271
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:24,066
I just want to know
what happened.

272
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,621
So do I. Believe me.

273
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:31,740
Something happened to me.

274
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,577
I have no memory
of being here, ever.

275
00:15:34,628 --> 00:15:36,078
What is this,
"Days of Our Lives?"

276
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:37,830
You're telling me you have
some sort of amnesia?

277
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:39,131
If I knew any of this,

278
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:41,317
would I have stepped foot
into this station?

279
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:43,669
I'm sorry.

280
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:45,321
I... I don't even
know your name.

281
00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:48,307
If this is some sort of a game,

282
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:51,010
you're either incredibly clever
or incredibly stupid.

283
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:52,428
I'm telling the truth.

284
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:57,850
Look...

285
00:15:57,934 --> 00:16:01,403
I don't know
what happened to your husband.

286
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:03,022
But I can find out.

287
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:05,941
How?

288
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:09,328
If you really know me,
then you know that's my job.

289
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:10,913
You really don't remember?

290
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:14,199
No. I really don't.

291
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:26,345
I'm Brenna Dobbs.

292
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:28,547
Brenna...

293
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:33,719
I'm sorry about what happened
to your husband.

294
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:39,608
But I can find answers...

295
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:41,393
just not from in here.

296
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:59,078
Come on.
Help me find some rope.

297
00:16:59,162 --> 00:17:00,913
If it's gonna look
like a break-out,

298
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:03,381
you're gonna need to tie me up.

299
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:14,510
What?

300
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:16,645
The boxed stuff doesn't
get better with age, Don.

301
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:44,239
Ahh!

302
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:49,478
Aah!

303
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,876
Hey, Sam.

304
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,294
So, how does it feel
to be a fugitive again?

305
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:16,880
Hate to say
"I told you so."

306
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:18,799
You <i>love</i>
<i>to say "I told you so."</i>

307
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,051
Actually, you're right...
I <i>do love to say "I told you so."</i>

308
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:24,170
So, I found something on,
uh, "crazy eyes McGee."

309
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:25,389
Turns out you two
knew each other.

310
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,773
What?

311
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:28,892
Biblically. I just
spoke to her roommate.

312
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:31,228
I got to say, man...
you really got around.

313
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:34,481
I mean, soulless or not
I'm actually kind of impressed.

314
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:36,049
<i>Eight Sierra Papa.</i>

315
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:37,684
<i>Got a 1057, 1100 block</i>
<i>of Hope Street. Over.</i>

316
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:40,019
Missing person...
another one.

317
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:42,706
Okay, all right.
I'll go. You stay.

318
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,824
Yeah. Fine.

319
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,158
- Sam?
- What?

320
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,293
Stay here.

321
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,577
Fine! Go!

322
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:05,095
Listen, thank you
for your time.

323
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,513
We're on it.

324
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:09,065
Yeah. Thanks.

325
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:12,652
This is Sam.
Leave a message.

326
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:15,255
Sam, answer the phone, damn it.

327
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:17,324
I found the connection
between the missing chicks.

328
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,559
They all banged the same dude...

329
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:20,894
you.

330
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,913
It's <i>you,</i> Sam.

331
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:25,282
The texts, the victims,
all of it...

332
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:27,868
it's a trap for <i>you.</i>

333
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,236
Call me back.

334
00:19:41,182 --> 00:19:43,615
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You can't be here!

335
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,418
Okay, p... please just listen.

336
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,606
- What happened to Debbie Harris?
- Debbie?

337
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,558
I let you out,
and she's just gone.

338
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:53,860
And y... you think
I did something to her?

339
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:56,196
I don't know what to think.

340
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,448
Look, um, I need your help.

341
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,367
Are you kidding?

342
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:03,603
I need the case files
that your husband made

343
00:20:03,654 --> 00:20:05,605
about the disappearances
last year.

344
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:06,907
So go to the station
and find it.

345
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,993
It's not there.

346
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:13,279
I broke in and I looked,
and it's gone.

347
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:16,299
And I have a theory
about who might have it.

348
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:20,053
Look, we both want
the same thing here, Brenna.

349
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,588
I promise.

350
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,640
We want to find out
what happened last year,

351
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,742
and we want to stop
what's happening right now.

352
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:32,849
The file's upstairs.

353
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:37,237
I'll be right back.

354
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,910
Let's go!

355
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:55,839
So, you guys just travel
all the time?

356
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,207
I mean,
you just pick up and go?

357
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,009
Doesn't that get hard?

358
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:00,994
Not when you're young...
it's great.

359
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:03,880
Once you got a family,
it's a little tougher.

360
00:21:03,965 --> 00:21:05,465
Deanna got pregnant,

361
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:07,367
and we didn't know
what we were gonna do.

362
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:09,853
But Mary was...

363
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,871
she was a blessing.

364
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:16,226
There's more in the garage.

365
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,894
Ah, listen, you sit.
I'll get it.

366
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:22,032
He misses her.

367
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,868
You know, at least you two
have each other.

368
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,353
Well, Samuel wasn't really
around when I was a kid.

369
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:30,023
We have more of a, uh,
business relationship.

370
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:32,375
Uh, do you have
any other family?

371
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:37,912
- Family just slows you down.
- Sam?

372
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:40,634
Sam?!

373
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,385
You all right?

374
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,637
Yeah. Yeah.

375
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:47,140
Um... All right,
let's see what you have.

376
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:24,427
Best guess...
it came from an Arachne.

377
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,245
- You ever seen one?
- No one has...

378
00:22:26,297 --> 00:22:28,348
not outside of Crete,
not for about 2,000 years.

379
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:30,467
- Then what do we even <i>know about them?</i>
- <i>Zip.</i>

380
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:31,885
Just a bunch of guesses

381
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,304
and a blurry picture
on the side of a Greek vase.

382
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:35,972
Yeah!

383
00:22:36,057 --> 00:22:36,940
Ohh!

384
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,825
Yo, ho, sea Captain.

385
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:42,862
So, I gather we got no clue
how to kill this thing, huh?

386
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,698
I guess we just go at it
till something sticks.

387
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:47,283
Well, great. I got an idea of where
it might be, at least.

388
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:50,236
So far, all the vics have been
men in their 30s,

389
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,405
and they've all gone missing
within a 2-mile radius.

390
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,157
So we just get out
and kick bushes.

391
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:55,408
No, that'd be a waste of time.

392
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,826
I mean,
it's all suburban sprawl...

393
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:58,211
hundreds of houses, at least.

394
00:22:58,278 --> 00:22:59,546
It could be <i>anywhere.</i>

395
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:02,749
- Lonely Pines Park.
- Yeah.

396
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,634
I say we make this thing
come to us.

397
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:06,835
How do we do that?

398
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,344
Hey, um, Brenna,
do you mind if I...

399
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:17,147
if I, um, borrow all this stuff
for a couple of hours?

400
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:20,767
Um, okay, I guess.

401
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:25,405
You really don't remember Roy,
do you?

402
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:32,562
He was a good man.

403
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:39,002
I've made peace that he's dead.

404
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,920
I have.

405
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:42,622
But I just want to know
what happened.

406
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:48,211
I'm sure he died a hero.

407
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,162
Sam, answer the phone,
damn it.

408
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:10,233
I found the connection
between the missing chicks.

409
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:12,351
They all banged
the same dude...

410
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:13,486
you.

411
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,188
It's <i>you,</i> Sam.

412
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:20,526
The texts, the victims, all of it...
it's a trap for <i>you.</i>

413
00:24:20,578 --> 00:24:23,329
Call me back.

414
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:46,719
Whoa. Whoa.

415
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:48,905
I almost shot you...

416
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:49,856
again.

417
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:50,990
What the hell?

418
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:52,442
I figured you'd come
and talk to her.

419
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:53,827
I told you to stay home, man.

420
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:56,412
Did you get my message?

421
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:59,164
Come on. We got to get you
out of here. Let's go.

422
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:07,914
Well we know that this is a monster

423
00:25:08,014 --> 00:25:10,694
with opposable thumbs
and unlimited text messaging,

424
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,402
and we know that it wants
to kill you specifically.

425
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:14,704
Does that about cover it?

426
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:16,867
It's an Arachne.

427
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,300
A what?

428
00:25:20,783 --> 00:25:22,500
I remembered.

429
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:24,252
You remembered?

430
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:25,988
Y... I'm sorry.

431
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,391
Uh, what else
have you remembered?

432
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:29,009
Don't worry, all right?
I... it's nothing to do with Hell.

433
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,545
- Uh-huh. Not <i>yet,</i> anyway.
- What can I do, Dean?

434
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:33,097
The stuff is just starting
to come back, all right?

435
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,448
Maybe it's natural.

436
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,234
- We're leaving.
- No, we can't.

437
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:38,101
We are not the only hunters
on the planet, okay?

438
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,387
We can call Bobby.

439
00:25:39,457 --> 00:25:41,841
- He and Rufus could come and wrap up.
- How?

440
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:42,956
Like you said,
it could be <i>anybody.</i>

441
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:45,002
- We got jack for leads.
- We know that it hates you.

442
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:46,857
I know who did this.

443
00:25:46,908 --> 00:25:49,710
I just... I can't remember.

444
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:52,518
I don't think
you get the risk here, Sam.

445
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,035
- Yes, I do.
- Really?

446
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,003
You get that every time
you scratch that wall,

447
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,672
that you are playing
Russian roulette?

448
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,123
Dean, I get you're worried,
okay?

449
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,925
And I know what you think
is gonna happen.

450
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:02,576
- But you know what? It will or it won't.
- Sam...

451
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:03,961
Look, I'm starting to think

452
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:06,413
that... that I might have done
some bad stuff here, Dean.

453
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,415
And so I don't care
if it's dangerous.

454
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,884
I have to set things right,

455
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,802
'cause I got
a frigging soul now,

456
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:14,021
and... and it won't let me
just walk away.

457
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:18,976
I'm staying here.

458
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:21,362
And I need you to back me up.

459
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,372
All right.

460
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,823
Why not?

461
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:36,210
Well, let's "memento"
this thing, shall we?

462
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:46,003
So, you're back 'cause it
started again, right... the disappearances?

463
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:49,006
You're not feds.
You actually hunt things.

464
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,475
You really don't remember?

465
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,463
I, uh, found something
on "crazy eyes McGee."

466
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,982
Turns out you two
knew each other.

467
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,003
You okay?

468
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,959
That's right.

469
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,044
Yeah, Lonely Pines Park,
one hour. Thanks, Roy.

470
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:29,263
All right.

471
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:30,664
Are you sure about this?

472
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,934
The Arachne's been snacking
on mid-30s guys.

473
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:34,936
We need bait
that fits the demo.

474
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:36,437
I'm too young.
You're too old.

475
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:39,340
89 and counting.

476
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,842
I still think that we should
have looped Roy in on the plan.

477
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,978
Do we want a credible
performance, or don't we?

478
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,196
But what if something
goes wrong?

479
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,731
Roy's a big boy.
He'll be fine.

480
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:48,182
Trust me.

481
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,034
It's just... not the way
I'm used to doing things.

482
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:51,452
Got it.

483
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,455
Welcome to the future.
Let's go.

484
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:04,632
Let's hope this thing's hungry.

485
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:25,519
Ugh! Aah!

486
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:34,061
Let's split up, look for him.

487
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,363
No, no, wait.
It's too late.

488
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,747
- Let's go!
- They're <i>gone,</i> Samuel!

489
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:39,250
Look... it's okay. I turned on
the G.P.S. on Roy's cell.

490
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:41,118
In English, please.

491
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:43,570
We can track them back
to wherever she goes.

492
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,873
So, what, Roy's just
some red-shirt to you?

493
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,091
Just spider bait?

494
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:49,460
No, no, of course not.
This is my back-up plan.

495
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:52,546
My God, son. You're about
as cold as they come,

496
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,848
you know that?

497
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:54,849
Let's go.

498
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,001
Poor bastard.

499
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:16,764
Help me.

500
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:26,640
I can't... feel...

501
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:33,396
Roy, hey, where is she?

502
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:37,118
Ugh!

503
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:38,369
Unh!

504
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:50,364
Aah!

505
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,382
Aah!

506
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:58,722
Ow.

507
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:02,543
Ahh.

508
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,540
Well, I guess
decapitation works.

509
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:11,902
Roy.

510
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,612
You're gonna be okay.
Just hang in.

511
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:23,664
We're gonna get you some help.

512
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,235
Listen, if we can get him
to the hospital quick...

513
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,120
- He can't be helped.
- What?

514
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:33,457
I don't know about Arachne,
but I do know about spiders.

515
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:35,909
One brown recluse bite
can kill you. This thing?

516
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:39,413
Look at these guys...
that poison's eating them alive.

517
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,765
- They're just dead men walking.
- So, what are you saying?

518
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,901
I'm saying we put him
out of his misery.

519
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:53,227
Sam... please.

520
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,597
Killing this thing
saved a lot of lives.

521
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,482
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- No.

522
00:31:58,567 --> 00:31:59,984
You're a hero.

523
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,431
We can't just
leave the bodies here.

524
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,483
Get the gasoline.

525
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,938
I know what happened.

526
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,541
Roy?

527
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:06,967
I love you.

528
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:12,339
What are you gonna say
to Brenna?

529
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,641
Relax, Dean.

530
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,676
Hey, Brenna, it's... it's Sam.

531
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,194
I'm just checking in.

532
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,280
Yeah, of course I can swing by.

533
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:22,666
Okay. Yeah. Bye.

534
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,653
What was that about?

535
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:26,987
She wants me to swing by.

536
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,238
For?

537
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:30,557
She said it's no big deal.

538
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,711
But I can tell
she's in deep trouble.

539
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,697
Dean, back door.

540
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,600
Sam.

541
00:33:56,685 --> 00:33:58,569
Light's on in the shed.

542
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,582
My spidey senses are tingling.

543
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:12,783
Shh.

544
00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:15,085
Sam?

545
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:18,088
Brenna?

546
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:19,873
Hey.

547
00:34:26,381 --> 00:34:28,215
What you did to Roy...

548
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:32,769
is it true?

549
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:45,899
Answer the question, Sam.

550
00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:10,811
You got to admit
I look good, Sam.

551
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,566
Well, except for
your little souvenir.

552
00:35:15,617 --> 00:35:17,401
You win. I'm here.

553
00:35:19,154 --> 00:35:20,321
Let Brenna go.

554
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:23,374
This has nothing
to do with her.

555
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:26,126
You come back around,

556
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,779
start hanging out
with my <i>wife,</i>

557
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,764
and you think this has
nothing to do with her?

558
00:35:31,783 --> 00:35:36,554
But then... you thought
I was out of the way, right?

559
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:39,957
I got to say, you get
a hell of a lot wrong, Sam,

560
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:43,811
like that thing
you threw me to.

561
00:35:43,895 --> 00:35:46,096
You thought
it was here to feed.

562
00:35:46,147 --> 00:35:48,131
- She was here to breed.
- Yeah.

563
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:50,768
That thing was playing
the mating game,

564
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:52,820
and I guess
I fit her profile...

565
00:35:52,904 --> 00:35:55,339
Me and all those other
poor bastards.

566
00:35:55,407 --> 00:35:57,641
She bit us to turn us
into what <i>she</i> was.

567
00:36:02,614 --> 00:36:04,481
By the time
you pulled that trigger,

568
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:07,201
I wasn't human.

569
00:36:07,285 --> 00:36:09,119
Not anymore.

570
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:11,589
So bullets didn't hurt me much.

571
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:18,045
Oh, and neither did fire.

572
00:36:18,129 --> 00:36:22,216
So after you left,
well, we ran.

573
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:26,637
Me... I hid for months,
nearly starved.

574
00:36:26,688 --> 00:36:28,939
But you know
what kept me going?

575
00:36:31,693 --> 00:36:34,845
Every night, I dreamed about
ripping your throat out.

576
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:37,815
I thought I was sending you
a neon sign.

577
00:36:37,882 --> 00:36:38,983
The text?

578
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:41,285
Taking all those girls
you screwed?

579
00:36:41,352 --> 00:36:43,287
I was kicking so much sand
in your eye,

580
00:36:43,354 --> 00:36:45,522
I couldn't figure out
why you weren't getting it!

581
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:49,910
Then Bren tells me
you've got brain damage.

582
00:36:49,995 --> 00:36:52,997
It's just too good.

583
00:36:53,064 --> 00:36:54,698
Where are they, Roy...

584
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:56,199
the women?

585
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:59,202
Scattered... in the wind.

586
00:36:59,254 --> 00:37:01,038
They're like me now.

587
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:05,042
You killed one monster,
you made so many more.

588
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,728
Congratulations.

589
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:10,180
The only question is,
do I kill you...

590
00:37:11,683 --> 00:37:13,717
or turn you?

591
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:24,528
Ugh!

592
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:27,948
No! Roy, stop!

593
00:38:07,845 --> 00:38:10,330
Brenna...

594
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:14,301
Look, I am <i>so</i> sorry.

595
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:21,841
Brenna, I... I mean, I...

596
00:38:40,711 --> 00:38:43,713
You okay?

597
00:38:43,798 --> 00:38:46,066
You were right.

598
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:49,803
We shouldn't have
come back here.

599
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:52,722
Well, you did
kill the spider man.

600
00:38:54,342 --> 00:38:58,044
So, you're suggesting what I did
back there was a good thing?

601
00:38:58,112 --> 00:38:59,596
- I'm just saying...
- What?

602
00:39:03,568 --> 00:39:05,685
Sam, y... y... you got to understand

603
00:39:05,736 --> 00:39:07,838
that all that crap last year...

604
00:39:07,905 --> 00:39:09,990
all of it...
none of it was you.

605
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,178
Let's be crystal clear, okay?

606
00:39:15,246 --> 00:39:16,613
It <i>was</i> me.

607
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:23,870
Well, can I get you anything?

608
00:39:23,938 --> 00:39:26,173
What are you now, my waitress?

609
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,792
I'm just trying to make you feel better.
Don't be a bitch.

610
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:33,713
Yeah, I'm fine.

611
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,934
Yeah, you <i>look</i> fine.

612
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:41,388
All I'm saying is
everything's gonna be okay.

613
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:42,973
I don't know, Dean.

614
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:45,425
If I did this here,
then who knows how many oth...

615
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:49,613
Sammy?

616
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:50,730
Sammy?!

617
00:39:52,066 --> 00:39:55,066
Sammy, talk to me!
