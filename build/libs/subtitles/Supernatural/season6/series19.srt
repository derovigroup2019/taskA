1
00:00:01,997 --> 00:00:04,599
Bring me creatures.
Aim high on the food chain

2
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:06,501
Whatever we bag...
ends up there.

3
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:08,436
That's where he tortures them,
interrogates them...

4
00:00:08,504 --> 00:00:10,104
I don't really know.

5
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:12,906
- We ain't your employees.
- Of course you are!

6
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:15,443
What's in the gift bag?

7
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:16,945
- You are.
- Not possible.

8
00:00:17,012 --> 00:00:18,513
You didn't hide your bones
as well as you should have.

9
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,017
Aah! Aah!

10
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:28,323
Who is she, this Eve bitch?

11
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:30,925
The mother of all of us

12
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:32,961
and the end of all of you.

13
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:36,965
The ashes of a Phoenix
can burn the mother.

14
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:38,266
"1861.

15
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:39,968
"Sunrise, Wyoming.

16
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:41,736
"Gun killed a Phoenix today.

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,572
Left a pile
of smoldering ash."

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,974
- Whose gun?
- Colt's.

19
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,242
We hop back in time,
we join up with Samuel Colt,

20
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:49,377
we hunt the Phoenix,

21
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:50,945
and then haul its ashes
back home.

22
00:00:58,053 --> 00:00:59,887
- Is that what I think it is?
- Ashes of a Phoenix.

23
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:00,989
You know what this means?

24
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:02,690
We take the fight to her.

25
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:11,933
- I'm serious.
- I'm serious.

26
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,568
That was way overpriced, dude.

27
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:16,771
Back where I'm from, okay,
it was like $3 a beer.

28
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:18,439
Okay.
Then, I'm buying next time.

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,942
I'm not even lying.
I'm not even joking at all.

30
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:22,343
Hey.

31
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:24,145
Heaven must be
missing an angel.

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,258
I think she likes me.

33
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:42,163
Okay, Fabio.
Let's... let's go.

34
00:01:58,013 --> 00:02:00,415
Are you okay, miss?

35
00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:01,783
I'm perfect.

36
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:05,520
I mean,
is... is that blood?

37
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:08,690
Yes, I suppose it is.

38
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,591
You sure you're all right?

39
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:30,011
Hey, what the hell?!

40
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:31,713
I gave him a gift.

41
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:35,917
Come on, man.
Let's get out here.

42
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,530
Aah!

43
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:08,349
Aaaaaaaaah!

44
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:21,994
Season 6 Episode 19
  "Mommy Dearest"

45
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:47,789
Hey.How you doing?

46
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,191
Five shells...
that's how I'm doing.

47
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:52,794
Well, you know,

48
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:55,129
it's a hell of a lot more
than we had last week.

49
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:56,597
Maybe.

50
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:58,699
Meaning?

51
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:01,402
Meaning I just had myself
a little mishap a few minutes ago,

52
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:03,237
and, uh...
well, here, look.

53
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:06,240
Whoa.

54
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:09,710
Huh.

55
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:12,013
This stuff is supposed to burn
the bejesus out of Eve.

56
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:13,514
It doesn't even give me
a sunburn.

57
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,349
The lore says it works.

58
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:17,318
That's always reliable.

59
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:19,053
Well, you know what?
M-maybe it's like...

60
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:22,123
maybe it's like iron or silver,
you know?

61
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,424
Hurts them and not us?

62
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:25,660
Maybe, but a fat lot of good
it does us

63
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,526
- until we find the bitch.
- I'm looking.

64
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:31,628
But I'll tell you,
maybe it's time you made a call.

65
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:34,569
Why's it always got to be me
that makes the call, huh?

66
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,437
It's not like Cass
lives in my ass.

67
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:37,939
The dude's busy.

68
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,841
Cass, get out of my ass!

69
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,642
I was never in your...

70
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:46,948
Have you made any progress
in locating Eve?

71
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,951
Well, we were gonna
ask <i>you</i> about that.

72
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:52,386
I've looked,
but she's hidden from me.

73
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:53,654
She's hidden from all angels.

74
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:56,457
Awesome.

75
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:59,460
You know, what we really need
is an inside man.

76
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:01,095
What do you mean?

77
00:05:01,163 --> 00:05:02,997
Something with claws
and sympathy.

78
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,566
Like a friendly monster?

79
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,569
Those are in short supply
these days, don't you think?

80
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,004
Sure, but we've met
one or two, right?

81
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:11,873
Maybe.

82
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:14,909
So, maybe we can find one.

83
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:35,796
Lenore.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

84
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,399
Hey, hey.
Lenore, stop.

85
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,136
Look, we're happy you're here.

86
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:45,238
My name's Lenore.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

87
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,511
It's been a long time.

88
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:53,147
You remember us?

89
00:05:53,215 --> 00:05:55,349
I remember.

90
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,318
Your hunter friend
almost killed me.

91
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,153
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

92
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:02,823
uh, he turned into a vampire,
and I chopped his head off.

93
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:05,860
Yeah, with razor wire.
Wicked.

94
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:08,129
Well, that's something.

95
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:10,631
What's going on?

96
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:11,866
Why am I here?

97
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:14,068
Well, um...

98
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:15,436
that's Cass.

99
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:17,505
He's our friend.

100
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:20,374
And we need to talk to you.

101
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:22,777
About Eve.

102
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:24,977
Eve?!

103
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:28,683
I have nothing to say about Eve.

104
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:30,117
You sure about that?

105
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:32,420
I'm trying to stay away
from her. Believe me.

106
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:34,889
Where's your nest?

107
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,391
Gone.

108
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:40,094
I couldn't fight it anymore.

109
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:42,596
It's her voice...

110
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:44,031
in our heads...

111
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,934
What it does to us.

112
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:51,439
So they left,
started killing again.

113
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:52,740
But not you.

114
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:54,608
Don't look so impressed.

115
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:57,878
I was hiding in a basement...
not exactly Club Med.

116
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:03,217
You don't know how hard it is
not to give in.

117
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:05,086
Everyone gives in.

118
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:09,190
All right, so, this psychic
two-way you got going...

119
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:10,992
does that mean you know
where mom's camped out?

120
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:12,326
You've got to be kidding me.

121
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:14,595
You want me to tell you
where she is?

122
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:17,398
You do know she could be
listening to us right now.

123
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:19,700
I might as well
be a video camera.

124
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,435
What are you thinking?

125
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:24,138
So, we don't have
the element of surprise.

126
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:25,506
We're still going in.

127
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,807
You're crazy.

128
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:28,409
I can't help you.

129
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,543
Can't or won't?

130
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:32,446
Look, it's clear as day

131
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:33,814
you still give a crap.

132
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:35,716
You don't want to kill,

133
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:38,219
and you don't want
this whole planet dead.

134
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:43,557
You actually believe
you can stop her?

135
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,825
Just tell us where she is.

136
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:50,831
Grants Pass, Oregon.

137
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:54,534
- And now she knows you're coming.
- Well, let's go see.

138
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:55,736
Hold on.

139
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:59,273
I didn't tell you this
out of the goodness of my heart.

140
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:00,441
I need something.

141
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:01,976
What?

142
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:05,980
Kill me.

143
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:07,548
- Lenore...
- Look...

144
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:09,250
we'll lock you down till
this whole thing is over, okay?

145
00:08:09,284 --> 00:08:10,651
Witness Protection.
You'll be safe.

146
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:13,654
You don't get it.
It's not about that.

147
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:15,356
I'm dangerous.

148
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:16,891
I hear her voice all the time.

149
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,159
You're not like
the rest of them.

150
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:21,095
I'm <i>exactly</i> like them.

151
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:23,464
I fed.

152
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:25,299
I couldn't help it.

153
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,601
The girl couldn't have been
more than 16, Sam.

154
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:31,305
I'll do it again.

155
00:08:31,373 --> 00:08:32,573
I can't stop.

156
00:08:33,674 --> 00:08:34,575
Not anymore.

157
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:36,977
You have to.

158
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:38,578
- Please.
- Lenore...

159
00:08:52,394 --> 00:08:54,527
We needed to move this along.

160
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:10,144
Well, I was expecting
more "Zombieland",

161
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:12,746
less "Pleasantville."

162
00:09:12,848 --> 00:09:15,249
Just because it looks
quiet don't mean it is,

163
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,384
especially if she's got a clue
we're coming.

164
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,153
Yeah, well, if she is here,

165
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:21,455
I'm glad we got <i>Smitey
McSmiterton</i> on our squad.

166
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:23,891
All right.
Where do we start?

167
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,160
I'm gonna need a computer.

168
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,968
All right.

169
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:37,771
I finally got the police database,
no thanks to this.

170
00:09:37,873 --> 00:09:39,173
I ask for a computer.

171
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:40,207
It <i>is</i> a computer.

172
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:42,510
No, a computer has buttons.

173
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:45,379
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, we're good. Thanks.

174
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:46,914
Anything?

175
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:49,416
Oh, nickel-and-dime stuff,
nothing weird.

176
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:50,885
Basically, dead end.

177
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,721
You think <i>Vampira</i> was lying?

178
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:56,423
I'll search the town.
Give me a moment.

179
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,597
Cass, we can still see you.

180
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:06,100
Yeah, I'm still here.

181
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:08,201
Okay, well, you don't
have to wait on us.

182
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:14,808
Well, now it just looks
like you're pooping.

183
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,011
- Something's wrong.
- What, are you stuck?

184
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:19,946
I'm blocked.

185
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:23,817
I'm powerless.

186
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:25,116
You're joking!

187
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:28,021
Something in this town
is, uh...

188
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:29,289
it's affecting me.

189
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:31,124
I assume it's Eve.

190
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,726
So, wait.
Mom's making you limp?

191
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:35,328
Figuratively, yes.

192
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:37,364
- How?
- I don't know, but she is.

193
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:39,533
Oh, well, that's great,
'cause without your power,

194
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,334
you're basically just a baby
in a trench coat.

195
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:49,576
I think you hurt his feelings.

196
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:53,080
I got something here, maybe.

197
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:54,848
Had to go federal to get it.

198
00:10:54,882 --> 00:10:57,684
Call went out from the local office
to the CDC last night.

199
00:10:57,752 --> 00:10:58,952
About what?

200
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:01,555
A Dr. Silver...

201
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:04,357
called in an illness
he couldn't identify.

202
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:07,661
Patient's a 25-year-old
African-American

203
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:10,263
named Ed Bright.

204
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,568
Well, that's not much to go on.

205
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:16,002
Well, it's our only lead, so...

206
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,004
So beggars can't be choosers.
Right. I get it.

207
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:19,606
All right, well,
let's finish up.

208
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:22,309
Excuse me. Hi.
Uh, I-is Dr. Silver in today?

209
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:24,578
My friend is very sick.

210
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:30,584
I have a, uh...
painful burning sensation.

211
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:33,386
Oh, well, he's out.
Sorry.

212
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,821
Do you happen to know
where he is?

213
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,189
He hasn't called in.

214
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,425
You might want to find yourself
some ointment.

215
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:45,098
What kind of doctor calls the CDC

216
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:48,535
and then goes AWOL
the very next day?

217
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:50,203
Let's have a look, shall we?

218
00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:09,523
Is this gonna take a long time?

219
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,264
What is it?

220
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:34,481
Ohh.

221
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,551
It's the patient, Ed Bright.

222
00:12:37,652 --> 00:12:40,487
Well, what kind of doctor
calls the CDC

223
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,556
and then stashes the gooey
corpse in his shed?

224
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,457
I don't understand
what's happening here.

225
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:48,061
Well, I know one thing
about the body...

226
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:50,297
we need some kerosene.

227
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,002
Here. Dr. Silver.
Wife, two sons.

228
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:58,405
Uh-oh.

229
00:12:58,472 --> 00:13:00,473
Hi, there.

230
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:01,808
Hi.

231
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:04,177
Who are you?

232
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,081
You casual Friday, agents?

233
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:09,816
We were on a case
a few miles out.

234
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:11,284
We got a call to come here.

235
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:13,284
So, how about you?
What's your business?

236
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:14,888
Oh, Dr. Silver's
a friend of mine.

237
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:16,323
Heard he didn't show up
for work today,

238
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,991
so I thought I'd stop by
and see if he's sick.

239
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:19,893
Not sick. <i>Missing.</i>

240
00:13:19,994 --> 00:13:22,295
Missing? Says who?

241
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,498
Says me... empty house,
no bags packed,

242
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,700
car still in the driveway.

243
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,802
Well, how'd you get on this?

244
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,036
Oh, it's a long story.

245
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:32,239
Tell you what... why don't
you put out an APB?

246
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:34,708
We'll compare notes down
at the Station. Sound good?

247
00:13:34,742 --> 00:13:36,610
Uh, yeah, yeah.

248
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:38,345
- Sure.
- Obliged.

249
00:13:39,714 --> 00:13:41,815
Wow, talk about talking
out of your butt.

250
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:44,317
Yeah.
Just hurry, you idjit.

251
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,234
Ohh.

252
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:03,536
So we got a missing doctor
and an oozy patient, huh?

253
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:04,871
Yeah. Plot thickens.

254
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:07,641
Well, let's go see what
Ed's roommates have to say.

255
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:09,743
Does Ed Bright have a brother?

256
00:14:09,777 --> 00:14:11,177
No. Why?

257
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:12,646
Then that's not his twin.

258
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:17,050
So, what... shifter?

259
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:19,152
I don't know
what we're looking at.

260
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:20,353
All right, Dean and me
are gonna go in.

261
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:21,855
You two stay here
and watch the door.

262
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,156
Something comes out, shoot it.

263
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,557
Yeah, best guess...
silver bullets.

264
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,693
I'm fairly unpracticed
with firearms.

265
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,897
You know who whines?

266
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:31,965
Babies.

267
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,183
Okay.
Don't touch anything.

268
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:04,987
Hey, hey, back here.

269
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:07,189
Come here.
Hey, hey, hey.

270
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,591
Talk to us.
What is this?

271
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:11,093
Ed?

272
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,028
- Ed, what's going on?
- What?

273
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:14,329
I'm not Ed.

274
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:22,037
What's wrong with me?

275
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:23,839
Uh, nothing.
You're okay.

276
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:25,340
You're okay, all right?
We're gonna get you help.

277
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:27,209
Let me ask you something.

278
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,510
Do I...

279
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:29,912
do all of us...

280
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:31,413
do we look like Ed?

281
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,215
What? No.

282
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,616
No, no, no, no, no, no,
of course not.

283
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,818
You, uh... you have a fever.
You're hallucinating.

284
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,921
Marshall, Marshall,
hey, what happened here?

285
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,522
Am I gonna die?

286
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,124
No. You're not gonna die, okay?

287
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:43,525
Now, you need to talk to us.
It's important.

288
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:49,831
Ed was feeling bad,
so I took him to the doctor.

289
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,937
I think
now we're all sick.

290
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,972
You think?

291
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,274
And before you got sick
and before Ed got sick,

292
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:01,643
did you do anything?
Did you go anywhere?

293
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:02,844
Hey, I need you
to focus for me.

294
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:04,646
I don't know.

295
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:05,948
Some bar.

296
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:07,082
A bar? What bar?

297
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,684
Eighth street, I guess.

298
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:09,952
Eighth street.

299
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,553
Um, and did anything happen
at the bar?

300
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:13,255
D-did you see anything?
Did you meet anyone?

301
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:14,957
Look, an ambulance is on the way.

302
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,259
A girl.

303
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,761
A girl? Okay. And?

304
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:21,063
A girl in white.

305
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:22,698
Good. Okay.

306
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:25,400
What did the girl in white do,
Marshall?

307
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:26,702
What...
what did she do to Ed?

308
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,570
Marshall!

309
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,911
I don't get it.

310
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:37,913
What, a bunch of regular Joes
wake up shifters?

311
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:39,081
What the hell?

312
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:40,582
Shifters usually
run in families.

313
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:41,783
This looks like an infection.

314
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:44,186
Nobody touched nothing?

315
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,521
Well, I'm bathing
in Purell tonight.

316
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,490
So, he said they met a girl.

317
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:49,591
It's got to be Eve.

318
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:50,592
But why would she do this?

319
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:53,428
Mommy monster.
Make more.

320
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:54,997
No, no, no, no,
Cass has got a good point.

321
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:56,598
I mean, if she's gonna
make a shifter army,

322
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,233
why make one that's
this sick, gooey and dying?

323
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,937
Add that to the pile of crap
that don't make sense.

324
00:17:02,005 --> 00:17:03,338
So, should we hit the bar?

325
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:19,154
Well, the sheriff's
a mook, but still...

326
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:21,423
you'd think he'd notice
this many missing folks.

327
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:43,845
We got a vamp over here.

328
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:50,652
Nope. Scratch that.
We got a wraith.

329
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,652
What the hell...?

330
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:56,158
What has teeth <i>and</i> a spike?

331
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:58,794
Never seen that in my life.

332
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:01,763
Oh, great.
So Eve's making hybrids now?

333
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:04,166
- Looks like.
- The question is, why?

334
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,401
I mean, what does she want
with a...

335
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:07,903
what do you call these?

336
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,872
Well, congrats. You discovered it.
You get to name it.

337
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:14,810
Jefferson Starships.

338
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,079
Huh?

339
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:19,881
Because they're horrible...

340
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:22,217
and hard to kill.

341
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,189
Looks like the whole bar
has been turned into the...

342
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,623
Jefferson Starships.

343
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:32,194
Fine. But why are all
the... starships dead?

344
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:34,663
I can't say, but...

345
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:36,131
It looks like
they all burned up.

346
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,299
Burned up? Like...

347
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,702
Like a high fever,
like the flu.

348
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,204
What the hell's going on here?

349
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:45,207
Does every monster in this town
have the Motaba virus?

350
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:46,541
Hands where I can see them!

351
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,715
Now, this is not
what it looks like.

352
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,117
Look, we're the feds.

353
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,719
Yeah? Well, feds are not allowed
to do this.

354
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:01,456
- Cuff 'em.
- Turn around.

355
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:23,945
Oof!

356
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,247
Listen, if we can
make a phone call,

357
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:26,882
we can straighten this all out.

358
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,151
Straighten out a massacre?
I'd like to see you try.

359
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:32,654
J-Jefferson starships!

360
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,904
Dean, wait!

361
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:55,177
Well, I'll say this...

362
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,980
you're the healthiest-looking
specimen I've seen all day.

363
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:01,683
I take my vitamins.

364
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,819
So, you want to tell us
what's going on here?

365
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:06,621
Hmm?

366
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,926
So, you boys are, uh,
Eve's cleaning crew?

367
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:12,794
Is that it? You, uh...

368
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:14,930
you come around
to clean up the bodies,

369
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:18,233
make sure the word
doesn't get out, huh?

370
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,135
Is that why you snatched up
the doctor?

371
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:23,538
You're so wasting your time.

372
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:26,608
You stupid head of cattle.

373
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,945
More starships.

374
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:32,214
Stay here.

375
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:03,645
You're Dr. Silver's boys.

376
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:07,682
All right, don't worry.
We're gonna get you out of here, OK?

377
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,751
- Uh, uh, keys...
- Yeah.

378
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:12,354
Look...

379
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:13,588
We're not gonna hurt you.

380
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,958
My name is Sam.
And that's my brother, Dean.

381
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,228
Those cops... they're not
coming back, ever.

382
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:27,836
What are your names?

383
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,939
Joe. This is Ryan.

384
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,543
Hiya, Ryan.
How you doing?

385
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,543
He won't talk...

386
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:38,847
Not since they came for us.

387
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,853
All right, listen, Joe,
we're gonna get you

388
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:47,756
out of those handcuffs.

389
00:21:47,857 --> 00:21:50,859
But you understand what's going on
around here, don't you?

390
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,160
So first we got to make sure
you're you.

391
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:53,795
How you gonna do that?

392
00:21:53,863 --> 00:21:57,766
Well, there's a few,
uh, dozen tests.

393
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:03,004
Okay, let's get started.

394
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,172
Ugh!

395
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:09,010
Y-you really think that's
gonna make me talk?

396
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,178
Something will.

397
00:22:14,717 --> 00:22:17,118
Got a couple of hungry
human boys here.

398
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:19,087
Come on, guys.

399
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:26,394
So, you two never
heard them talk...

400
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:29,030
about a mother or...

401
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,099
someone named Eve?

402
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:35,136
It was just me and Ryan
in there.

403
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:38,840
And your folks?

404
00:22:38,908 --> 00:22:41,109
Cops said we were next.

405
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:44,412
They said we were food.

406
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:48,216
You have any other family?

407
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:49,818
An uncle in Meritt.

408
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,753
Meritt. What's that, like
15 miles outside of town?

409
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:53,622
Okay, we'll get you there.

410
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:55,924
Dean.
Can I have a word?

411
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:01,930
We need to find Eve now.

412
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,331
Yeah. Go.

413
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:04,866
Me and Sam just
got to make a milk run.

414
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,334
No, we need your help here.

415
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:07,736
Hold your water.

416
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:09,137
We'll be back in a few.

417
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:11,640
Dean, Dean.

418
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:14,676
Millions of lives
are at stake here, not just two.

419
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:16,576
- Stay focused.
- Are you kidding?

420
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:17,646
There's a greater purpose here.

421
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:18,880
You know what?

422
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:20,682
I-I'm getting
a little sick and tired

423
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,350
of the greater purposes, okay?

424
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:24,185
I think what I'd like to do
right now

425
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:26,955
is save a couple of kids,
if you don't mind.

426
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,058
We'll catch up.

427
00:23:31,794 --> 00:23:33,261
Okay, guys, let's go.

428
00:23:33,362 --> 00:23:35,664
Come on.

429
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:01,389
Hey.
You should get some rest.

430
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,018
They won't take long.

431
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:33,755
You don't know that.

432
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:37,125
They may find more
wayward orphans along the way.

433
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,328
Oh, don't get cute.

434
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:42,030
Right.

435
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,332
Pardon me for highlighting

436
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:47,335
their crippling and dangerous
empathetic response

437
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:48,937
with "sarcasm."

438
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:57,245
It was a bad idea,
letting them go.

439
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,481
Come on.

440
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:02,350
You don't <i>let</i> Sam and
Dean Winchester do squat.

441
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:04,385
They do what they got to.
You know that.

442
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:08,356
Anyway, we want Eve,

443
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:10,358
we need coordinates.

444
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:13,495
So, we can stand here
bellyaching,

445
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:16,765
or we can go poke that pig
till he squeals.

446
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:17,766
Thoughts?

447
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:01,176
You know,
she can see you right now.

448
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:05,413
And you're just making her mad.

449
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,082
Then tell the bitch
to come get me.

450
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:11,486
I need five minutes alone
with him.

451
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:14,522
What for?

452
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:17,292
Cass...

453
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:18,993
your batteries are dead.

454
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:22,997
Give me five minutes.

455
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,000
All right. Fine.

456
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,009
Aaaaaah!

457
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,752
Eve's at 25 Buckley Street.

458
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,757
You can call Sam and Dean.

459
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:02,851
Rigorous interrogation, huh?

460
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:05,987
Well, we got a location.

461
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:08,857
Now we just got to get
close enough to take a shot.

462
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:12,560
All right. Well...

463
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:18,166
Let's all take one.

464
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:20,468
Load 'em up. Make 'em count.

465
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:31,813
You got to be kidding me.

466
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:33,381
She's been in there
the whole time?

467
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,183
Why'd she ever let us in?

468
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:37,619
Or out.

469
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:39,120
Well, there's one way
to find out.

470
00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:40,588
What, just stroll in?

471
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:43,324
We don't know who's human
or who's her.

472
00:27:45,795 --> 00:27:47,896
Well, there's one way
to draw her out.

473
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,198
- Me and Sam will go in.
- Dean...

474
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,884
Look, we don't get a shot off,
you two better.

475
00:27:54,153 --> 00:27:55,553
That's the plan?

476
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:58,256
Yeah. Pretty much.

477
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:07,865
Well, at least
it ain't complicated.

478
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:25,683
Now what?

479
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:28,920
Crap. Crap.

480
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:30,188
Crap.

481
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:31,289
Starships?

482
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:32,490
Yeah.

483
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:33,891
Is there anybody in this diner

484
00:28:33,926 --> 00:28:35,893
that is <i>not</i>
<i>a flesh-eating monster?</i>

485
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:37,295
Uh, me and you.

486
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:38,896
Okay, well, let's get
the hell out of here.

487
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:40,765
- Shall we?
- Two specials, right?

488
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:42,967
Uh, no, that's not for us.
We were just heading out.

489
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:45,603
Now, that would be rude, Sam.

490
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:53,878
Let me guess.

491
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,880
Eve.

492
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:57,382
Pleasure.

493
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:00,785
Why don't we step outside,
chat?

494
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:02,420
Why? This is private.

495
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:28,513
Phoenix ash.
I'm impressed.

496
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,715
I bet you had to go
a long way for that.

497
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:32,417
You have no idea.

498
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:36,621
Destroy these.
Thank you.

499
00:29:36,688 --> 00:29:38,089
Relax.

500
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,191
I'm not here to fight.

501
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:43,728
No, just to rally every freak
on the planet,

502
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:46,831
bring in Khan worms and...
and half-assed spider-men

503
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:48,232
and dragons.

504
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,735
Really, sister? Dragons?

505
00:29:50,803 --> 00:29:53,905
So, I dusted off some of the old classics.
I needed help.

506
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:55,406
With what?

507
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:57,542
Tearing apart the planet?

508
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:03,347
You misunderstand me.

509
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:05,550
I never wanted that,

510
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:06,617
not at first.

511
00:30:07,753 --> 00:30:09,520
I liked our arrangement.

512
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:10,822
What arrangement?

513
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:12,557
The natural order.

514
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:14,557
My children turn
a few of you...

515
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:17,895
You hunted a few of them.
I was happy.

516
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,199
Okay, so what changed?

517
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:23,301
My children, no thanks to you,

518
00:30:23,402 --> 00:30:26,104
started getting kidnapped
and tortured...

519
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:28,005
even my firstborns.

520
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,808
I was pushed into this.

521
00:30:30,843 --> 00:30:32,410
After all, a mother
defends her children.

522
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:34,412
Really?

523
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:37,048
You're gonna use the
"mother of the year" defense?

524
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:38,316
You?

525
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,118
It happens to be true.

526
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,387
Know what?

527
00:30:43,422 --> 00:30:46,891
Maybe you'll believe it
if I look a little more like this.

528
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:54,298
Oh, you bitch.

529
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,401
She died to protect you,
didn't she?

530
00:30:57,503 --> 00:30:59,337
See?

531
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:01,239
You understand a mother's love.

532
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:02,807
- I'm no different.
- All right, you know what?

533
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:05,042
This conversation's over.
If you're gonna kill us, kill us.

534
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,311
You?

535
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:08,713
No.

536
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:10,748
It's Crowley I want dead.

537
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:13,317
Well, you're too late there.

538
00:31:13,352 --> 00:31:16,120
That little limey mook
roasted months ago.

539
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:19,157
Crowley's alive.

540
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:22,026
That's impossible.

541
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:24,829
I see his face through the eyes

542
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:28,533
of every child
he strings up and skins.

543
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:32,069
Any idea why he's hurting
my babies?

544
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:33,838
He wants Purgatory, right?

545
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:36,641
Location, location, location.

546
00:31:36,742 --> 00:31:39,143
Is that what he told you?

547
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:41,379
It's about the souls.

548
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:43,147
Well, what about them?

549
00:31:43,182 --> 00:31:45,249
They're power,
you simple little monkey.

550
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:48,786
Fuel.

551
00:31:48,854 --> 00:31:52,156
Each soul a beautiful,
little nuclear reactor.

552
00:31:52,191 --> 00:31:55,059
Put them together,
you have the Sun.

553
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,962
Now think what
the king of Hell could do

554
00:31:57,996 --> 00:32:02,099
with that vast,
untapped oil well...

555
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,968
How powerful he'd be.

556
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:07,772
Now Crowley wants
to siphon off my supply

557
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:10,608
and torture my children to do it?

558
00:32:10,676 --> 00:32:14,111
Okay, fine.
I'll quit playing nice.

559
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,181
I'll turn you all.

560
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:20,017
Every soul... mine.

561
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:24,922
Let's see how hard his Hell burns
when everyone comes to me.

562
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,191
He asked for it.

563
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,030
You know, last I checked
there were a few billion of us.

564
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,730
That plan might take a while.

565
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:36,934
What exactly do you think
I'm doing here?

566
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:38,302
I'm building the perfect beast.

567
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:41,205
Wait a second.

568
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:44,108
All those...

569
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:45,810
all those <i>things</i>
we've been finding.

570
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:48,512
Call it Beta testing.

571
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:54,051
Well, I think your formula
might be a little off.

572
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,853
They're imploding
all over town.

573
00:32:55,921 --> 00:32:59,523
Ohh, there were a few
unfortunate failures.

574
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,959
But I eventually got it right.

575
00:33:02,025 --> 00:33:04,959
Quiet... smart... inconspicuous.

576
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:07,965
It can spread through
a whole town in under a day.

577
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,734
Oh, and the best part...

578
00:33:09,768 --> 00:33:11,435
you've been with it the whole time.

579
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:14,972
What?

580
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,374
Yes, you were the final test.

581
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:17,942
I had to see

582
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:21,579
if it could slip past hunters
undetected, of course.

583
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:24,582
Little Ryan.

584
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:39,363
Joe?

585
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:45,870
Ryan?

586
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:53,678
Aah!

587
00:34:05,196 --> 00:34:06,463
You look upset.

588
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:10,334
If it makes you feel
any better,

589
00:34:10,435 --> 00:34:13,537
Ryan was bound to work on you...

590
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:15,339
little wayward orphan...

591
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,975
like yourselves.

592
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:20,577
There's nothing you can do
about it now.

593
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:21,945
So let's talk.

594
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,647
Nothing to say.

595
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:25,115
Well, that's where
you're wrong.

596
00:34:25,216 --> 00:34:28,852
I have an offer to propose.

597
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:31,355
Crowley...

598
00:34:31,422 --> 00:34:34,224
as you know,
not so easy to find.

599
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:36,727
So, here's the deal...

600
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:38,328
you find him...

601
00:34:38,363 --> 00:34:41,532
bring him to me...

602
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:42,733
I let you live.

603
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:46,837
Pass.

604
00:34:46,938 --> 00:34:48,438
- Dean...
- Sam, no.

605
00:34:48,473 --> 00:34:50,140
The answer is no.

606
00:34:51,476 --> 00:34:53,343
You say that like
you have another option.

607
00:34:53,411 --> 00:34:54,545
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

608
00:34:54,612 --> 00:34:56,346
You think?

609
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,223
Well, so much
for your plan "B."

610
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:12,930
And you, wondering,
"why so flaccid?"

611
00:35:12,964 --> 00:35:14,531
I'm older than you, Castiel.

612
00:35:14,566 --> 00:35:16,667
I know what makes angels tick.

613
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:20,470
As long as I'm around,
consider yourself...

614
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:23,974
unplugged.

615
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:26,343
Work for me.

616
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:29,947
It's a good deal.

617
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,884
Bonus...
I won't kill your friends.

618
00:35:33,952 --> 00:35:35,052
All right, look,

619
00:35:35,153 --> 00:35:36,587
the last few months,

620
00:35:36,654 --> 00:35:39,890
we've been working
for an evil dick.

621
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:42,259
We're not about to sign up
for an evil bitch.

622
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:44,761
We don't work with demons.

623
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:46,863
We don't work with monsters.

624
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:49,866
And if that means you got to
kill us, then kill us!

625
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:50,968
Or...

626
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:52,968
I turn you.

627
00:35:53,104 --> 00:35:56,073
And you do what I want anyway.

628
00:35:59,177 --> 00:36:01,178
Beat me with a wire hanger,
answer's still no.

629
00:36:08,386 --> 00:36:09,519
Don't...

630
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:12,289
test me.

631
00:36:13,691 --> 00:36:14,691
Bite me.

632
00:36:17,295 --> 00:36:18,795
- No!
- Dean!

633
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:26,303
Phoenix ash.

634
00:36:27,705 --> 00:36:29,840
One shell...

635
00:36:29,907 --> 00:36:31,608
one ounce of whiskey...

636
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:32,643
down the hatch.

637
00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:36,613
Little musty on the afterburn.

638
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:39,816
Call you later, mom.

639
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:10,947
Shut your eyes!

640
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:25,987
We gotta take you on more
monster hunts.

641
00:37:26,698 --> 00:37:28,999
Hey, Cass, um...

642
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:31,068
Dean's bleeding pretty good.

643
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:33,670
I think she turned me
into a Jefferson Starship.

644
00:37:33,771 --> 00:37:34,871
Could you clear that up, too?

645
00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:41,378
All right, we're good.

646
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:43,213
We got to go. Now.

647
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:44,781
Where?

648
00:37:46,382 --> 00:37:47,484
The kid.

649
00:37:47,585 --> 00:37:49,586
The little kid...
he's one of them.

650
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,821
Unbelievable.

651
00:37:50,888 --> 00:37:52,789
Yeah, I know, Cass.
You told me, all right?

652
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,024
Let's just go.

653
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:06,536
So, we kill the wicked witch,
and she still wins.

654
00:38:06,604 --> 00:38:08,705
I mean, they could have turned
half the town by now.

655
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:10,941
Don't say it.

656
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:18,914
Found them.

657
00:38:25,022 --> 00:38:27,223
Well, who ganked them?

658
00:38:32,463 --> 00:38:33,530
Demons.

659
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:46,555
So, what do you think?

660
00:38:46,556 --> 00:38:49,658
I think that demons
don't give a crap

661
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:53,658
about monster twins
unless they're told to.

662
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:55,897
So, you think she was
telling the truth?

663
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:58,300
The truth about what?

664
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:03,705
She said that Crowley's still kicking.

665
00:39:05,571 --> 00:39:08,205
But I burned his bones...
how ca...

666
00:39:09,178 --> 00:39:10,445
Was she certain?

667
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:11,980
Sounded pretty sure.

668
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:14,349
According to her,

669
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,952
Crowley's still waterboarding
her kids somewhere.

670
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:18,854
I don't understand.

671
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:21,156
Well, he's a crafty
son of a bitch.

672
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,358
I'm an angel.
I'll look into it immediately.

673
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:26,261
Cass!

674
00:39:27,396 --> 00:39:29,097
Let us know what you find out!

675
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:34,903
What? What?

676
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:38,506
How <i>did</i> Crowley get away?

677
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:42,077
I mean, it's not like Cass
to make mistakes like that,

678
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:43,411
unless...

679
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,280
Unless what?

680
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:47,115
Unless he meant to.

681
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:53,021
Bobby, this is Cass
we're talking about.

682
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:55,123
Do <i>you</i> believe this?

683
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:00,828
Sam?

684
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,632
Look, it's probably nothing.

685
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:05,000
It's just...

686
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:10,438
You know what? You're right.
It's... it's probably nothing.

687
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:41,169
Really, Cass...

688
00:40:41,237 --> 00:40:43,538
this is getting ridiculous.

689
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:47,642
How many times

690
00:40:47,743 --> 00:40:50,645
am I gonna have
to clean up your messes?
