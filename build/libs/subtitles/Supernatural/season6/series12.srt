00:00:09,673 --> 00:00:10,793
Hey, Dean.
It's me.

2
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,230
How long you been back, Sam?

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,150
About a year.

4
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:16,968
You been back
practically this whole time?!

5
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:19,671
You finally had what you wanted.
You wanted a family.

6
00:00:19,756 --> 00:00:22,089
I need you to go.
You're a hunter.

7
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:27,546
# I'm back #

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,497
DEAN: It's Sam. He's different.

9
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:31,717
# I'm back in the saddle again #

10
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:34,002
It's his soul.
It's gone.

11
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:36,521
# I'm back #
CROWLEY: You bag me a live Alpha,

12
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:38,323
and I'll give you
little Sammy's soul back.

13
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:39,891
# I'm back in the saddle again #

14
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:41,143
MAN: We're waiting for the word.

15
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:42,394
DEAN:
Their Alpha's building an army.

16
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:43,478
Like we're going to war.

17
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:45,397
Bring me creatures.

18
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:48,349
# I'm back in the saddle
again #

19
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:50,569
But if you're the first...
who made you?

20
00:00:50,653 --> 00:00:52,287
We all have our mothers.

21
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:54,373
When we freaks die,
where do we go?

22
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:55,741
Not Heaven, not Hell.

23
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,525
- Purgatory.
- And I want it.

24
00:00:57,577 --> 00:01:00,462
- I want my soul back.
- I can't.

25
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,967
Sam's soul has been
locked in the cage

26
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:08,086
with Michael and Lucifer.

27
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:10,555
Putting this thing back in
would smash me to bits.

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,424
CASTIEL: We have no idea
what will happen.

29
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:14,893
Paralysis, insanity,
psychic pain so profound

30
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:17,763
that he's locked inside himself
for the rest of his life.

31
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:19,547
BOBBY:
Death, the Horseman.

32
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,882
Hello, Dean.

33
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,051
- Death said he can put up a wall.
- A wall?

34
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:24,069
You wouldn't remember Hell.

35
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:25,854
What's the bet?

36
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:27,739
DEATH: I want <i>you</i> to be <i>me</i>
<i>for one day.</i>

37
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:30,242
It's my life. It's my soul.
I don't want it.

38
00:01:30,326 --> 00:01:32,360
You need to scar your vessel.

39
00:01:32,412 --> 00:01:33,394
Sorry.

40
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:36,281
Don't do this.

41
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:38,500
Don't scratch the wall.

How you doing?

47
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:04,860
I'm great.
This is great.

48
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:06,445
Penny, it's gonna be okay.

49
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:09,698
You know, a lot more people die
in the shower.

50
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:11,867
Good to know.
Thanks.

51
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:14,269
I didn't think we'd run into
any weather, though.

54
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:20,492
- Please?
- Couple minutes. All right? We're close.

55
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:22,210
[Sighs]
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:31,286
- What was that?!
- What?

57
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:34,306
Something just flew by
the window! It was huge!

58
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,091
Probably just a bird, okay?

59
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:38,510
No! No, Stan,
that was <i>not</i> a bird.

60
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:40,345
Well, then, what was it?

61
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:43,014
I don't know.
[Sighs]

62
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:46,184

I promise.

64
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:50,772
Hey, just close your eyes, okay?

65
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:54,359
It's okay.
Just lean back.

66
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:56,244
Try to relax.
[Thunder crashes]

67
00:02:56,312 --> 00:02:59,147

His soul is in place.

78

Is he ever gonna wake up?

79
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:50,115
I'm not a human doctor, Dean.

80
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,733
Could you take a guess?

81
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,101
Okay.

82
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:55,120
Probably not.

83
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:56,955
- Oh, well, don't sugar-coat it.
- I'm sorry, Dean,

84
00:03:57,023 --> 00:03:59,107
but I warned you not to put
that thing back inside him.

85

What was I supposed to do?

Let T-1000 walk around,
hope he doesn't open fire?

felt like when I touched it.

skinned alive, Dean.

your brother,

Dean, he's been through
how much?

100
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:59,167
Somehow, he always bounces back.

101
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:02,304
He's never been through this.

- Might be.

- What?

Yes, it is... for once.

I should know?

No.

00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,363
How is he?

157
00:07:58,447 --> 00:08:00,866
He's, uh...

158
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,535
He's good. Really good.
Better than I could have hoped.

159
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:07,289
Uh-huh.

160
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:08,874
What?
Why the poop-face?

I'm glad he's better.
I really am.

162

But...

163
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:28,593

Menendez on me not 10 days ago.

164

And now it's all just...
erased?

165
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:35,817
Sorry. I'm having a bit of
a hard time even looking at him.

166
00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:37,152
It wasn't Sam.

167
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,687
Well, maybe it wasn't <i>all</i> Sam,

168
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:40,155
but it was him, Dean.

169
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:42,190
Well, what do you want to do, Bobby?
We tell him everything?

170
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:44,559
No. Just wish I could,
that's all.

171
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,561
Yeah, but if we start throwing
that crap at him,

172
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:48,163
we don't know
what's gonna happen.

173
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,165
- It could ... it could crack the wall.
- I know. I know.

174
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:51,399
So, you know what?

175
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,919
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a gift horse,

176
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:55,787
and I'm not looking for teeth.

177
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:58,089
I'm sending Death
a damn fruit basket.

178
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:01,576
He's gonna find out, you know.

179
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:03,911
One way or another,

Well, they're not like
the Loch Ness monster, Dean.

00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:53,068
this book will show you
how to open a door.

717
00:38:55,205 --> 00:38:56,238
Door to Purgatory.

718
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:57,590
Well, I know a demon

719
00:38:57,674 --> 00:39:00,092
who would have loved
to have known about that.

720
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:06,132
So, how do you open the door?

721
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:09,769
Ask Cloverfield.

722
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:11,854
I'm pretty sure
he's got that page.

00:39:11,921 --> 00:39:13,755
[Rumbling, wind howling]

724
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:24,817
<i>"Ego coniuro vos,</i>

725
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:28,988
<i>insolubiliter</i>
<i>ad mei potenciam alligati"!</i>

726
00:39:29,072 --> 00:39:30,623
[Rumbling intensifies]

727
00:39:32,993 --> 00:39:34,193
[Crying]

728
00:39:39,749 --> 00:39:41,300
[Sizzling]

729
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:43,452
<i>"Ad me...</i>

730
00:39:43,503 --> 00:39:46,589
<i>- sine prestolacione venire...</i>
<i>- Let me go! Please stop!</i>

731
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,974
<i>- ...debeatis aperiat"!</i>
<i>- No!</i>

732
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:52,127
- Please don't!
- It'll go easier if you relax.

733
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:53,813
[Screaming]

734
00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:59,985

BOBBY: It gets worse.
SAM: Worse?

737
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:12,448
This ain't talking about how
to take a vacation over there.

738
00:40:12,516 --> 00:40:16,836
This is all about opening a door
to let something in.

739
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,288
Bring something here.

740
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:20,372
What?

741
00:40:20,457 --> 00:40:21,507
I'm working on it.

742
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:25,494
Could you give us something?

743
00:40:25,545 --> 00:40:27,847
- I got a name.
- Okay.

744
00:40:27,931 --> 00:40:30,499
"Mother".

745
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,219
Mother? M... mother of what?
Mother of dragons?

746
00:40:33,303 --> 00:40:35,020
I wish.

747
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:37,389
It says it a few times here.

748
00:40:37,474 --> 00:40:39,058
"Mother of all".

749
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,792
Welcome.

750
00:41:00,029 --> 00:41:02,331
You kept me waiting.

751
00:41:02,382 --> 00:41:04,300
DEAN: What the hell
does "mother of all" mean?

752
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:06,535
I don't know.

753
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:14,426
MOTHER:
We have so much to do.

754
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,680
Let's get started.
