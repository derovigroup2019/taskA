00:00:02,858 --> 00:00:04,209
Sam!

"Carry On Wayward Son." Performed by Kansas

3
00:00:07,112 --> 00:00:09,380
You got to promise
not to try to bring me back.

4
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:12,750
# There'll be peace
when you are done #

5
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:16,304
# lay your weary head to rest #
Sammy!

6
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:19,974
# Don't you cry no more #

7
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:22,010
You're a hunter. Now you know
your brother's out there.

8
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:23,294
I need you to go.

9
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:25,313
It's Sam.
He's different.

10
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:28,733
It's his soul. It's gone.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,854
I'm going to go to hell
to fetch your brother's soul.

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,474
I don't remember anything.

13
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:40,111
# Once I rose
above the noise and confusion #

14
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:44,282
# just to get a glimpse
beyond this illusion #

15
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,867
# I was soaring ever higher #

16
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:48,419
Finding Purgatory's
important to me...

17
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:52,490
an untapped oil well
of every fanged, clawed soul.

18
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,759
Do you have any idea
what souls are worth?

19
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:56,160
What power they hold?

20
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:57,345
Raphael
and his followers,

21
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:59,430
they want him
to rule heaven.

22
00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:02,550
The last thing we want
is to let him take over.

23
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:05,470
That little limey mook
roasted months ago.

24
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:08,172
Crowley's alive.

25
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:10,481
I want to discuss
a simple business transaction.

26
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:11,609
With me?

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,562
You and Crowley have been
going after Purgatory together?

28
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:16,731
I can stop Raphael.

29
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:18,533
You have to trust me.

30
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:21,469
# Don't you cry no more #

31
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:14,505
We're closed.

32
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:17,575
Just, uh...
Just give me a second.

33
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:19,427
Sorry, pal.
We... we open at noon.

34
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:21,929
Look,
you don't understand.

35
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,686
Okay, I-I think
I understand... just fine.

36
00:02:28,754 --> 00:02:30,087
Look, I-I don't need
this kind of hassle,

37
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,756
so, seriously,
just get the hell out.

38
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:34,058
Please. Please, just give me
a minute to think, that's all.

39
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:37,562
Then I'm out of your hair.
One minute, please.

40
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:49,123
What's your name?

41
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,242
I don't know.

42
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:53,745
What do you mean
you don't know?

43
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:57,331
I mean I don't remember.
I don't remember anything.

44
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:05,253
   Season 6 Episode 22
"The Man Who Knew Too Much"

45
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:14,271
Come on.
You're dickin' with me.

46
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:15,139
Nothing?

47
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,667
I'm telling you... blank slate.

48
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:19,034
Well, you got
a wallet, I.D.?

49
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:21,453
I wish I did.

50
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:23,472
Okay, what's the last thing
you remember?

51
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:26,291
Um...

52
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:28,443
I woke up on a park bench,

53
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:32,080
cops shoving a flashlight in
my face, trying to take me in.

54
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:34,800
- So you ran.
- No, I, um...

55
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:37,669
I knocked them out cold,
both of them.

56
00:03:37,754 --> 00:03:39,588
No, look,
I didn't mean to.

57
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,506
It just happened really fast,
you know?

58
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,608
I-I think instinct
or something, I guess.

59
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:46,011
That's some instinct.
Yeah, tell me about it.

60
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:47,796
I mean, who even knows
how to do something like that?

61
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:50,682
We'll get you to the E.R. the...
the quacks will hash it out.

62
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,300
No.

63
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:53,568
Try "yeah."

64
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:55,170
Look, the bats
have flown the belfry.

65
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,122
- You need to see a doctor.
- No, I...

66
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,478
I don't have time.

67
00:04:03,529 --> 00:04:06,364
Time for what?

68
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,917
Look, it's hard to explain.

69
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:11,986
I just feel like
I-I have to... be somewhere.

70
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:13,988
There's s-something
I got to stop.

71
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,925
Oh, like a wedding?
A train?

72
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:19,795
No, something important,
something like...

73
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,880
- Life or death, like...
- Hey, hey, hey.

74
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:23,432
Just relax.

75
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:27,886
Y-you can't poop it out.
So, just... it'll come to you.

76
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:47,355
What is it?

77
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,626
You a horror fan?

78
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:54,913
Yeah, um, I think so.

79
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:56,698
You know,
I really think so.

80
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:58,583
Something...
something about this.

81
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:01,870
Phillips ain't
his last name. It's Lovecraft.

82
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:07,425
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

83
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,661
Seriously,
we are taking you to a doctor.

84
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:11,563
Have you got a computer?

85
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:13,148
What?

86
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,987
That's it. It exists.
Look... two towns over.

87
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:21,072
- You think you're staying in this dump?
- Maybe.

88
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:23,441
Maybe you're a hooker.

89
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:25,076
I guess I'll find out.

90
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:28,363
Look, um...

91
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:30,899
I don't know how to say, uh...
thanks for everything.

92
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,001
Where do you think you're going?

93
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,619
I'll be fine.

94
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:37,122
Says the head case that
just slumped over a minute ago.

95
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:39,708
Look, is there any way I can
convince you to go to a hospital?

96
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,294
No.
Apparently, I'm stubborn.

97
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:43,845
Well...

98
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:45,380
So am I.

99
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:48,133
I'm driving.

100
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:50,869
Look, that's really nice of you
but not necessary.

101
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:52,398
Really? Okay, look,
your eggs are scrambled.

102
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:53,623
But...

103
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:55,190
But nothing.

104
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:57,192
No, I mean,
I'm... I'm just some guy.

105
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:00,278
I-I could be anybody.
You got to be nuts.

106
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:02,063
I've been called that.

107
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:03,698
Look, if I let you
go off alone,

108
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,484
I won't be able to sleep
at night.

109
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:10,338
And, honestly, I'm dying to know
how it all turns out.

110
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:18,747
So, uh,
where do we start?

111
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:21,282
Uh, ground floor,
corner room...

112
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:23,051
nearest
to the fire escape.

113
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:25,053
That's the one I'd pick...
quickest getaway.

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,622
And why do you know that?

115
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:30,842
I just do.

116
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,275
Hey, you got
a credit card?

117
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:48,910
Uh...

118
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,614
Why?
Are we, uh, checking in?

119
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:54,666
Sort of.

120
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,675
Dude...

121
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,210
Who are you?

122
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,429
Good question.

123
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,939
This all yours?

124
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:19,340
I don't know.

125
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:22,644
I guess.

126
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:24,613
Well, I love what you've done
with the place.

127
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,200
It's very "Beautiful Mind"
meets... "Se7en."

128
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:31,352
Sorry.
I talk when I'm nervous.

129
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:37,792
Hey, well,
I guess we know your name.

130
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,661
Nice to meet you,
Jimmy Page.

131
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:45,083
And, uh, Neil Peart.

132
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:47,552
And Angus Young.

133
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:50,088
Okay, listen, no offense,

134
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,424
but I'm... really starting
to freak out.

135
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:53,925
You and me both.

136
00:08:05,438 --> 00:08:07,722
Where is she?

137
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:10,158
She said to
meet her here.

138
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:12,494
I'll try her again.

139
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,878
- Elle?
- Hey.

140
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:31,624
I guess I could have used
your help after all.

141
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:32,849
Just be still.

142
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,634
- What happened?
- They took me.

143
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,753
I got away.

144
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:41,022
Oh, Ellie.

145
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,307
Oh, what have they done
to you?

146
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,943
Everything.

147
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:46,978
The demon I could have handled,
you know?

148
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:49,631
But when
the Angel stepped in...

149
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:55,153
I told him, Bobby.

150
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:58,873
They have enough
to crack Purgatory wide open.

151
00:08:58,941 --> 00:09:01,543
Tell me.
I need to know.

152
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,279
They need virgin blood.
That's a milk run for them.

153
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:09,084
And they need the blood
of a Purgatory native.

154
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:11,720
Well, they've got
plenty of that now.

155
00:09:11,787 --> 00:09:12,954
Have they opened it yet?

156
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:15,707
Mnh-mnh. Tomorrow.

157
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,793
The moon and the eclipse.

158
00:09:18,844 --> 00:09:19,894
I'm sorry, Bobby.

159
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:22,480
- No, it's okay.
- I'm sorry, really.

160
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:24,465
Just tell us where they are.

161
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:29,137
Elle?

162
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,698
I'm sorry
this had to happen.

163
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,537
Crowley got carried away.

164
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:48,656
Yeah, I bet it was all Crowley,
you son of a bitch!

165
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:50,542
You don't even see it,
do you?

166
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:53,178
How totally off the rails
you are.

167
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:54,429
Enough!

168
00:09:54,496 --> 00:09:55,880
I don't care
what you think.

169
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,600
I've tried to make you
understand. You won't listen.

170
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,218
So let me make this
simple.

171
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:04,305
Please go home
and let me stop Raphael.

172
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:06,191
I won't ask again.

173
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:08,860
Well, good, 'cause I think
you already know the answer.

174
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:14,382
I wish
it hadn't come to this.

175
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:20,405
Well, rest assured,
when this is all over...

176
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:21,990
I will save Sam,

177
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:24,709
but only
if you stand down.

178
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:26,027
Save Sam from what?

179
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:32,467
Hey, hey.
Are you okay?

180
00:10:34,336 --> 00:10:35,369
Sam.

181
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:38,423
My name is Sam.

182
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:44,262
So, uh,
what do you remember?

183
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:46,397
Well

184
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:48,349
It might sound pretty strange
if I said it aloud.

185
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,052
Oh, it... it couldn't get
any stranger.

186
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:55,907
Yeah?
Don't be so sure.

187
00:10:59,228 --> 00:11:00,895
Look, I-I don't know.

188
00:11:00,946 --> 00:11:02,780
I mean, it's all pretty spotty,
you know?

189
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:06,784
I just remember I was...
I was with, uh... with two guys.

190
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:10,738
One was, like,
a male-model type,

191
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:14,092
and the other was
an older guy named, uh...

192
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:16,410
Bobby.

193
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:20,231
Okay. Well,
what are you looking for?

194
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:24,269
Here. Bobby Singer.
That has to be it.

195
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,290
Is there a phone number?

196
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,491
No, just an address.
Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

197
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,890
South Dakota.

198
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:31,943
Okay, uh...

199
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:33,528
L-listen, Sam...

200
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,530
- Sam, right?
- Yeah.

201
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:37,393
Look, I'm really sorry,
but this is...

202
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:39,018
is where I got to get off.

203
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:41,486
Oh, no. Of course.
No problem.

204
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,405
Okay. Well, how are you
gonna get there?

205
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:52,664
I guess
I'll take my car.

206
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:02,056
That's mine.

207
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:03,308
Are you sure?

208
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:04,642
Oh, yeah.

209
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:06,094
Look, Sam,

210
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:08,763
I don't feel right
about you going off like this.

211
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:10,631
Oh, look, don't worry.

212
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:13,851
Y-you've done way too much
for me already.

213
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:15,353
That's not what I mean.

214
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:16,854
What I mean is, uh...

215
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:19,140
I've got a bad feeling,
you know,

216
00:12:19,191 --> 00:12:22,160
with those I.D.s
and that shady-ass hotel room.

217
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:24,329
Whatever you're looking for...

218
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:26,614
you might not like what you find.

219
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:31,152
What other choice do I have?

220
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:33,538
You could stick around here
a little bit longer,

221
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,123
get your head straight,

222
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:36,824
instead of going off,
flying blind into...

223
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:40,545
What the hell was that?!

224
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,513
Stay down.

225
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:54,943
Sam!

226
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,344
Sammy. Sammy?!

227
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,981
Sammy?

228
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,352
Come on.
Snap out of it.

229
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:27,425
Anything?

230
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:30,703
I can't just sit here, Bobby.
I've got to help him.

231
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:31,646
Dean.

232
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:33,824
You know, "Dreamscape"
his noggin... something.

233
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:35,382
You know what Cass did.

234
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,800
The dam inside
your brother's head is gone,

235
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:39,724
and all hell's spilling loose.

236
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:41,686
- We don't know what's going on inside.
- I don't care.

237
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:44,359
- We have got to do something!
- And we will.

238
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,728
But right now, we got 16 hours
till they pop Purgatory.

239
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,947
I'm down one man.

240
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:51,532
I can't afford to be down two.

241
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,168
Yeah, and how's that going, huh?
We've got no line on Crowley.

242
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:56,237
We got no line on Cass.
Balthazar's M.I.A.

243
00:13:56,288 --> 00:13:57,588
I mean, all we've got

244
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:59,290
is Sam going through
whatever the hell this is!

245
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:00,675
You know...

246
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:05,596
...this is exactly
what Cass wants...

247
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:07,932
for you
to fall to pieces.

248
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:13,388
Just try to think
of what Sam would want.

249
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:20,228
Find Cass, Bobby.

250
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,896
Find him now.

251
00:14:34,443 --> 00:14:35,793
Do you smell whiskey?

252
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:37,662
Okay, Sam,
would you focus?

253
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:40,248
Yeah. I'm sorry.

254
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:42,550
Okay, so, who shot at us?

255
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:45,336
I-I didn't really get a good look.

256
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:47,472
Okay, we got to go
to the cops.

257
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:49,257
No. Look, if we can just get
to my friends,

258
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:50,558
they can help us...
I know it.

259
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,226
Okay, you don't know
if they're your friends, okay?

260
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:54,312
You don't know anything
about anything.

261
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:56,764
- Just turn around.
- No.

262
00:14:56,815 --> 00:15:00,301
- Look, you're safer with me.
- How do you know that?

263
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:03,271
You're scaring me.

264
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:24,509
What? No way.

265
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:30,715
What was that?

266
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,967
What do you mean?
It's daylight.

267
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,186
Yeah?

268
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,855
It was night,
and now it's day.

269
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,441
It was always day.

270
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,894
No, no, no, no, no.
No, it wasn't. It...

271
00:15:42,978 --> 00:15:45,313
what the hell
is going on here?

272
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:48,399
Okay, so I am all filled up
on crazy for today.

273
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:50,401
You know what, Sam?
I'll... I'll see you.

274
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:52,737
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey, hey.

275
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:58,292
Get in the car.

276
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:19,063
Wow.

277
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,820
My God.

278
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:19,073
Am I really that gawky?

279
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,459
Howdy.

280
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:24,412
This is impossible.

281
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:27,381
Cold. Try again.

282
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,084
I'm, uh...
I'm hallucinating.

283
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:31,502
Warmer.

284
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:33,787
But see, normally,

285
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,674
you're awake
when you're tripping balls.

286
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:38,559
I'm dreaming?

287
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:42,263
And someone just won a copy
of the home game.

288
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:44,065
We're inside
your grapefruit, Sam.

289
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:47,685
Son...
You've been juiced.

290
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,471
I-I-I don't remember
anything.

291
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:53,274
Well, your B.F.F. Cass brought
the hell wall tumbling down,

292
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:56,477
and you, pathetic infant
that you are,

293
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:58,779
shattered into pieces.

294
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,666
Piece... Piece.

295
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,368
I-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

296
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:05,870
Why would you?

297
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:08,456
You're jello, pal,
unlike me.

298
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:10,991
What are you?

299
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:12,376
I'm not handicapped.

300
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:15,212
I'm not saddled
with a soul.

301
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:19,317
In fact, I used to skipper
this meat-boat for a while.

302
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:24,505
It was smooth sailing.
I was sharp, strong.

303
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:27,675
That is, till they crammed
your soul back in.

304
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:29,843
Now look at you.

305
00:18:29,895 --> 00:18:33,197
Same misty-eyed milksop
you always were.

306
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:36,400
That's because
souls are weak.

307
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:38,235
They're a liability.

308
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:43,541
Now, nothing personal,
but run the numbers.

309
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:47,295
Someone's got to take charge
around here

310
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:48,696
before it's too late.

311
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,434
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

312
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:18,619
You think I'm bad?

313
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:21,889
Wait till you meet
the other one.

314
00:20:36,005 --> 00:20:38,138
Sammy!
Sam!

315
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:59,760
I remember who I am...

316
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:03,497
Everything I did this past year.

317
00:21:03,548 --> 00:21:06,217
And I remember you.

318
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:13,774
Walk away,
or the girl dies.

319
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:22,616
There goes your leverage.

320
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,209
Didn't I tell you
to turn back,

321
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:33,744
that you wouldn't like
what you found?

322
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:36,247
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:36,331 --> 00:21:38,415
I'm so sorry.

324
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,968
Not as sorry
as you're gonna be.

325
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:58,218
Look what the cat
dragged in.

326
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,322
Well,
at least you mud-fish

327
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:03,824
finally got
the angel-proofing right.

328
00:22:03,892 --> 00:22:05,058
How's sleeping beauty?

329
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,912
You didn't steal any kisses,
I trust?

330
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:10,948
What the hell took you so long?

331
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:12,867
Honestly?

332
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:14,451
I was having second thoughts.

333
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:15,870
About?

334
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:17,755
About
whether to help you.

335
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,406
I was thinking maybe...

336
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:22,593
maybe I should rip out
your sticky bits instead.

337
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:24,211
And what did you decide?

338
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:27,464
Well...

339
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:33,537
Cass and Crowley are there.

340
00:22:33,605 --> 00:22:36,524
That's where
the show gets started.

341
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:42,146
All right, well, give us a minute
to pack up and then zap us there.

342
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,898
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so.

343
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:44,843
Balthazar.

344
00:22:44,844 --> 00:22:46,437
I'm betraying a friend here...

345
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:48,285
a very powerful friend.

346
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,437
We all are.

347
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:53,674
So I think I've stuck
my neck out far enough already.

348
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:57,077
Good luck.

349
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:13,394
Your Purgatory
power shake, monsieur...

350
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:16,897
half monster, half virgin.

351
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:21,735
Thank you.

352
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:28,359
You seem even more constipated
than usual.

353
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:30,411
Maybe get you some colon blow?

354
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:32,947
I'm renegotiating our terms.

355
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:36,483
Is that so?
What terms do you propose?

356
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:38,318
You get nothing.

357
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,839
Not one single soul.

358
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:44,258
Can't help notice...

359
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:46,310
seems a bit...
unfairly weighted.

360
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:53,834
Castiel... you wouldn't dare.

361
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:56,687
I brought you this deal.

362
00:23:56,771 --> 00:24:00,340
You think I'm handing
all that power...

363
00:24:00,392 --> 00:24:02,293
to the King of Hell?

364
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,995
I'm neither stupid nor wicked.

365
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:07,114
Unbelievable.

366
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:09,850
Have you forgotten that you're
the bottom in this relationship?

367
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:11,068
Here are your options.

368
00:24:11,152 --> 00:24:13,654
You either flee, or you die.

369
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:16,040
We made a pact.

370
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:19,076
Even I don't break contracts
like this.

371
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,194
Flee...

372
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:22,713
or die.

373
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:28,268
Boy, you can't trust anyone
these days.

374
00:25:09,361 --> 00:25:10,728
Hey.

375
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:15,065
Hey!

376
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:20,971
Oh.

377
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:23,691
Hi, Sam.

378
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:28,729
So?

379
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,214
Which one are you?

380
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,568
Don't you know?

381
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:44,795
I'm the one
that remembers Hell.

382
00:26:02,874 --> 00:26:05,793
Time's up, Dean.

383
00:26:05,846 --> 00:26:07,463
Just a second.

384
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:17,723
All right, this is
where we're gonna be, Sam.

385
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:22,812
So you get your lazy ass
out of bed and come meet us.

386
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:27,399
Sammy, please.

387
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,731
I wish you hadn't come,
Sam.

388
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,768
I had to.
I'm here, right?

389
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:48,637
Out there in the real world,
I'm at Bobby's, aren't I?

390
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:51,140
How do you know?

391
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,541
This whole time,

392
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:55,127
I smell nothing
but old spice and whiskey.

393
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:57,897
I figured
if I could get back here,

394
00:26:57,981 --> 00:27:00,499
back to my body,
I could...

395
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:03,903
I don't know...
I could snap out of it somehow.

396
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,539
First, you have to
go through me.

397
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:08,357
Why?

398
00:27:08,408 --> 00:27:11,327
Humpty-dumpty has to put himself
back together again

399
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:14,029
before he can wake up.

400
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,865
And I'm the last piece.

401
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:19,752
Which means...

402
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:22,922
I have to know what you know...

403
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:27,459
What happened in the cage.
Trust me.

404
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:30,813
You don't
want to know it.

405
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:37,519
You're right.

406
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:39,788
But I still have to.

407
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:41,690
Sam...
you can't imagine.

408
00:27:41,758 --> 00:27:44,944
Stay here, go back,

409
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:48,614
find that bartender,
go find Jess, but don't do this.

410
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:50,933
I know you.

411
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:52,902
You're not strong enough.

412
00:27:55,705 --> 00:27:57,539
We'll just have to see.

413
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:01,410
Why is this so important
to you?

414
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:04,663
You know me.

415
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:06,949
You know why.

416
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,218
I'm not leaving my brother alone
out there.

417
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,399
I'm not gonna fight you.

418
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:25,500
But this is your last chance.

419
00:28:38,147 --> 00:28:39,931
Good luck.

420
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:43,652
You're gonna need it.

421
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:22,291
You rang, Cass?

422
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:24,159
Yeah.
We have a problem.

423
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,545
Dean Winchester
is on his way here.

424
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:29,164
Really? Oh. How'd he even
know where we were?

425
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:33,168
Apparently...
We have a Judas in our midst.

426
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,504
Ah.

427
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:37,056
Holy hell.

428
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:39,308
Who is it?

429
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:43,062
I bet it's that
bloody little cherub, isn't it?

430
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:49,018
I don't know.

431
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:50,686
But I-I need you to find out.

432
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:53,105
Of course.
Um, right away, right away.

433
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:54,678
Uh, but what do you
want me to do about Dean?

434
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:55,724
Nothing.

435
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:58,861
I'll handle him myself.

436
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:03,248
Castiel?

437
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:07,069
Are you all right?

438
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,271
First Sam and Dean,
and now this.

439
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:14,710
I'm doing my best
in impossible circumstances.

440
00:30:14,761 --> 00:30:18,180
My friends... they...

441
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:20,632
abandon me...

442
00:30:20,717 --> 00:30:22,684
plot against me.

443
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:26,939
It's difficult to understand.

444
00:30:27,023 --> 00:30:30,976
Well, you've...
you've always got little old me.

445
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:39,701
Yes.
I'll always have you.

446
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,403
Cass...

447
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,578
I count a dozen mooks,
probably more.

448
00:31:22,645 --> 00:31:24,813
Demons?

449
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:28,750
Angels.

450
00:31:28,818 --> 00:31:31,670
Well, how the hell are we
gonna take out that many Angels?

451
00:31:31,754 --> 00:31:35,207
We don't.
We'll ninja our way in.

452
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,193
Awesome, yeah...
till they hear your knee squeak.

453
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:39,461
Shut up.

454
00:31:39,512 --> 00:31:41,163
Oh, what,
now you got thin skin?

455
00:31:41,214 --> 00:31:42,965
No, shut up.

456
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:44,149
You hear that?

457
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:55,444
What the hell is that?

458
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:00,866
Oh...
T. Rex, maybe?

459
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,039
Holy mother of...

460
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:11,577
Get to the car.
Get to the car.

461
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,356
Never underestimate
the King of Hell, darling.

462
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:45,027
I know
a lot of swell tricks.

463
00:32:45,078 --> 00:32:50,032
Now, I think it's time
to re-renegotiate our terms.

464
00:32:54,403 --> 00:32:57,372
Sweaty hands, mate.

465
00:32:57,423 --> 00:32:59,041
I don't understand.

466
00:32:59,092 --> 00:33:00,926
You can palm me
all you want.

467
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,795
I'm safe and sound under
the wing of my new partner.

468
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:08,717
Hello, Castiel.

469
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:12,221
Raphael.

470
00:33:21,612 --> 00:33:23,126
Consorting with Demons.

471
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:24,662
I thought that was beneath you?

472
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,968
Heard you were doing it.

473
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:28,636
Sounded like fun.

474
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:29,654
You know, Castiel,

475
00:33:29,738 --> 00:33:31,773
y-you said all sorts
of shameful,

476
00:33:31,824 --> 00:33:35,476
appalling, scatological
things about Raphael.

477
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:39,280
I found him... her...

478
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:41,666
to be really... quite reasonable.

479
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,134
You fool.

480
00:33:43,202 --> 00:33:46,588
Raphael will deceive and destroy
you at the speed of thought.

481
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:48,923
Right, right, 'cause
you're such a straight shooter.

482
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:51,125
She... he...

483
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:52,961
has offered me protection
against all comers.

484
00:33:53,012 --> 00:33:55,546
In exchange for what?

485
00:33:55,631 --> 00:33:57,582
The Purgatory blood.

486
00:34:00,502 --> 00:34:04,305
Castiel, you really think
I would let you open that door?

487
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:07,508
Take in
that much power?

488
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,179
If anyone is going to be
the new God, it's me.

489
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,317
He's gonna bring
the Apocalypse and worse.

490
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:18,185
Hey, this is your doing,
mate.

491
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:20,989
I'm merely grabbing
the best offer on the table.

492
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,793
Now,
you have two options.

493
00:34:25,861 --> 00:34:27,996
Flee or die.

494
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:58,693
Ianua magna purgatorii,

495
00:34:58,744 --> 00:35:02,363
clausa est ob nos,

496
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:08,169
lumine eius
ab oculis nostris retento.

497
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:11,122
Bobby.

498
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,058
Bobby?

499
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:16,094
Huh?

500
00:35:16,178 --> 00:35:18,129
Come on.
We got to go.

501
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:23,417
Sed nunc stamus
ad limen huius ianuae magnae

502
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:26,104
et demisse, fideliter,

503
00:35:26,188 --> 00:35:31,559
perhonorifice,
paramus aperire eam.

504
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,645
Creaturae terrificae,

505
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,900
quarum ungulae et dentes,

506
00:35:38,951 --> 00:35:43,037
nunquam tetigerunt
carnem humanam.

507
00:35:58,337 --> 00:35:59,954
Bit busy, gentlemen.

508
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:03,474
Be with you in a moment.

509
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:29,650
Aperit fauces
eius ad mundum nostrum, nunc,

510
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:32,920
ianua magna aperta tandem!

511
00:36:40,846 --> 00:36:43,765
Mm-hmm.

512
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:46,167
Maybe I said it wrong.

513
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:50,021
You said it perfectly.

514
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:51,973
But what you needed
was this.

515
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:13,044
I see.

516
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:21,919
And we've
been working with...

517
00:37:22,004 --> 00:37:24,138
dog blood. Naturally.

518
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:26,824
Enough of these games, Castiel.

519
00:37:26,892 --> 00:37:28,976
Give us the blood.

520
00:37:29,044 --> 00:37:30,377
You...

521
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:32,396
Game's over.

522
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:35,817
His jar's empty.

523
00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:41,239
So, Castiel,
how'd your ritual go?

524
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:43,658
Better than ours, I'll bet.

525
00:38:12,075 --> 00:38:14,877
You can't imagine
what it's like.

526
00:38:14,945 --> 00:38:16,629
They're all inside me...

527
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:20,550
millions
upon millions of souls.

528
00:38:20,617 --> 00:38:22,134
Sounds sexy.

529
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:25,588
Exit stage Crowley.

530
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:29,759
Now, what's the matter,
Raphael?

531
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,811
Somebody clip your wings?

532
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:33,179
Castiel, please.

533
00:38:33,263 --> 00:38:36,799
You let the Demon go...
but not your own brother?

534
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,768
The Demon I have plans for.

535
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:40,937
You, on the other hand...

536
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,036
So, you see...

537
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,171
I saved you.

538
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:04,126
You sure did, Cass.
Thank you.

539
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:07,847
You doubted me...

540
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,165
fought against me.

541
00:39:13,203 --> 00:39:15,154
But I was right
all along.

542
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:18,090
Okay, Cass, you were.
We're sorry.

543
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,461
Let's just defuse you,
okay?

544
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,497
What do you mean?

545
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,735
You're full of nuke.
It's not safe.

546
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,120
So before the eclipse ends,

547
00:39:31,187 --> 00:39:34,857
let's get them souls
back to where they belong.

548
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:36,208
Oh, no.
They belong with me.

549
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:38,828
No, Cass, it's
scrambling your brain.

550
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,012
No, I'm not finished yet.

551
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,248
Raphael had many followers,

552
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:45,217
and I must...

553
00:39:45,285 --> 00:39:47,136
Punish them all severely.

554
00:39:49,756 --> 00:39:51,874
Listen to me.

555
00:39:51,925 --> 00:39:54,927
Listen...

556
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:59,482
I know there's a lot
of bad water under the bridge.

557
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:02,351
But we were family once.

558
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:04,687
I'd have died for you.

559
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:07,556
I almost did a few times.

560
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:09,375
So if that means anything
to you...

561
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:13,746
Please.

562
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:18,918
I've lost Lisa,
I've lost Ben,

563
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:20,736
and now I've lost Sam.

564
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,123
Don't make me lose you, too.

565
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:30,262
You don't need this kind
of juice anymore, Cass.

566
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:33,749
Get rid of it
before it kills us all.

567
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:38,854
You're just saying that
because I won...

568
00:40:38,922 --> 00:40:40,589
Because you're afraid.

569
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,896
You're not my family,
Dean.

570
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:49,115
I have no family.

571
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:07,049
I'm glad you made it, Sam.

572
00:41:09,753 --> 00:41:13,305
But the Angel blade
won't work,

573
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,891
because I'm not an Angel
anymore.

574
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,397
I'm your new God.

575
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:24,466
A better one.

576
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:28,487
So you will bow down

577
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:32,825
and profess your love unto me,
your Lord...

578
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:37,997
...or I shall destroy you.
