182
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,200
You mind telling him up and at 'em?
He's got some guests.

183
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,960
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

These are Agents...

189
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,110
Hey.

190
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,540
What's this?

191
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,350
You out late last night, Cal?

192
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,730
Just, uh, you know, a
couple beers with friends.

193
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,130
How many's a couple?

194
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,460
I don't know. Three, four tops.

195
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,860
If all you had was beer,

196
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,250
then how come you're sweating vodka?

197
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,690
And looks to me like you slept
in those clothes. Am I right?

198

[Chuckles]

199
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,390
I don't know. I-I guess.

200
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,510
So what you're saying is,

201
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,940
you got blind drunk, you blacked out.

202
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,750
Something tells me this
isn't the first time.

203
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,280
So, Cal, truthfully,

204
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,840
who knows what you've
really been up to at night?

205

Look, what's this about?

208
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,070
We're investigating the
death of Ronald Garrigan.

209

My brother?

210
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,690
Sorry for your loss.

211
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,150
Yeah, I thought that was
some kind of animal attack.

212
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,420
No love lost between
the two of you, huh?

213
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,780
Look, we had our
differences, I guess.

214
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,160
You love your brother,
of course, but...

215
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,590
Ron had a lot of problems.

216
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,380
He was, uh, volatile.

217
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,460
Last time he was here,
you called the cops?

218
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,140
Yeah, look, he came
in here all messed up

219
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,140
and he was yelling.

220
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,330
He shoved Mandy.
So, yeah, I called the cops.

221
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,420
I don't see how that has to do with...

222
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,680
Your landlord was found dead this week.

223
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,280
Were you aware of that?

224
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,760
Saw it in the papers. Why?

225
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,640
Well, you two were pretty
far behind on your rent, right?

226
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,130
He had sent eviction papers?

227

228
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,360
I-I'm sorry.

229
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,480
That was an animal attack.

230
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,740
Funny enough, yeah... both of 'em were.

231
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,350
So, great, great. Yeah, guys.

232
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,180

think I had to do with 'em?

Yeah, doesn't even know
where he was last night.

238
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,420
Bag him now?

239
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,650
No. We make sure.

240
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,060

to a lifetime of demon rape?

Look, all I'm saying is,

362
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,320
that between this and
the daylight attacks,

363
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,520
something's not adding up.

364
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,400
I'm not just gonna hand

365
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,750
her over to Crowley
until we figure out what.

366
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,880
You understand?
[Sighs]

367
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,850
Okay. Okay. I understand.

368
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,810
How 'bout you go check
out Cal's crime scene.

369
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,000
See if we're missing anything.

370
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,570
I'll come back and
keep an eye on Amanda.

371
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,970
How 'bout you go
and I'll stay here?

372
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,900
Dean, I still know
how to do my job.

373
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:10,449
[Scoffs]

374
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,940
I'm just gonna watch her. That's all.

375
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,590
Trust me.

376
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,590
Uh-huh...

377
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,637
[Bones crunching,

he's still breathing.

[Lucky whimpering]
You okay, boy?

384
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,030
Gotta find a Vet.

385
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,520
Hurry.

386
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,470
Hey!

387
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,680
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait! Mister!

388
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,350
Hey, mister, wait! That's my dog!

389
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,480
That's my dog.

390
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:35,905
[Exhales sharply]

Hey.

SAM: Hey, it's me.

396
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,660
DEAN: Well, I got bupkes here.

397
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,060
I definitely got something.

398
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,560
It ain't a werewolf, for one.

399
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,770
Yeah, what is it?

400
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,970
Skin-walker.

401
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,670
A skin-walker?

402
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,430
As in...

403
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,660
As in, the family dog
seriously needs a neuter.

404
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,800
Wow.

405
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,980
I haven't heard of a
skin-walker in years.

406
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,760
I'm actually a little
rusty on the profile.

407
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,920
You and me both.

408
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,290
Uh, I just got the low down from Bobby.

409
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,940
They can change anywhere, anytime.

410
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,920
Skin-walkers infect you with a single bite.

411
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,190
Otherwise, they're
basically a werewolf cousin...

412

Silver will drop 'em, they
chow hearts like snausages.

413
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,190
So what happened?
Did you catch him?

414
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,190
Not exactly,
but I have some idea where he might be.

415
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,150
Hiya, Lucky.

416
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,010

[Chain rattles]

424
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320

428
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,930
Well, I got to tell you, Lucky...

429
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,760
you got us stumped.

430
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,000
I mean, why shack up with the family?

431
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,070
Is it a kinky thing?

432
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,460
Do you like to play with your food?

433
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,250
Roll over, Lucky. Speak.

434
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,230
Go to hell.

435
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,360
Already been. Didn't agree with me.

436
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,260
So, look, how about I
take this silver knife,

437
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,570
and start carving some
dog until you behave?

438
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,770
You do what you got to do.

439
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,090
Hang on, Sam.

440
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,530
Listen, you don't have to
tell me why you're with the family.

441
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,790
I get it.

442
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,940
Oh, you do, do you?

443
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,260
You killed every threat
that came near them.

444
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,200
You care about them,

445
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,190
in your own whack-a-doodle kind of way.

446
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,490
It's obvious.

447
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,360
What I want to know is,

448
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,300
who was that guy you
were kibitzing with?

449
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,720
He a skin-walker, too?

450
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,040
Look, I can't say anything.

451
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,320
But if you don't,
then you're gonna put

452
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,300
the girl and the
little boy in danger.

453
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,350
And sooner or later, all this
crap is gonna come for them.

454
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,420
Now, look, we don't give
a rat's ass about you.

455
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,210
We want to help them.

456
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,290
That's our angle. That's it.

457
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,890
Yeah, that guy, he's a...

458
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,180
whatever it is I am.

459
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,900
And he's not the only one.

460
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,130
How many are you?

461
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,440
About 30.

462
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,160
We were all... we were kind of recruited.

463
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,040
Recruited?

464
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,500
Yeah. Me, I was living on the streets.

465
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,280
They found me.

466
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,970
They told me one small bite,

467
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,140
I'd be strong, I'd be fast.

468
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,740
Sniffing people's butts?
Yeah, that's a real step up.

469
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,430
Well, it was for me.

470
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,760
Where is this little
Scooby gang of yours?

471
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,650
Everywhere.

472
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,880
We're out there finding families,

473
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,940
and once they take us in, we lay low.

474
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,570
"Lay low"? What the hell's that mean?

475
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,170
- Well, we're waiting for the word.
- What word?

476
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,650
Once we're settled, we get the signal...

477
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,640
...and we all turn on our families.

478
00:26:57,689 --> 00:26:59,213
[Sighs]

479
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,420
We change them, all in one night.

480
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,880
30 becomes 150.

481
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,900
God, you're a sleeper cell.

482
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,880
Yeah, well, that's one way to say it.

483
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,500
So you're waiting for word from who?

484
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,940
Who organized you?

485
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,550
There's a pack leader.

486
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,380
Your Alpha?

487
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,590
What's an Alpha?

488
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,230
The... the first skin-walker, the strongest.

489
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,530
Well, he's plenty strong,

490
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,330
but, no, I-I don't think so.

491
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,530
I'm pretty sure there's
guys like him in other towns.

492
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,090
We're not the only pack out there.

493
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,950
Fantastic. Then you
can help us stop him.

494
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,620
Oh, no, I can't. No.

495
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,450
Yes, you can.

496
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,750
No, you guys don't get it. No one can.

497
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,040
These guys who turned
me... they're ruthless.

498
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,640
[Sam whistling]

499
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,030
Sam, not helping.

500
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,530
Fetch this, dick.

501
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,340
Listen to me.

502
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,100
What are you gonna do
to that family, really?

503
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,340
You gonna put your jaws
around that little boy's throat?

504
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,710
Clamp down, listen to
him cry for his mom?

505
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,260
'Cause I'm gonna guess

506
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,690
that these are the only
people who in your pathetic life

507
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,580
have ever showed you any kindness.

508
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,360
So it's either that...

509
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,480
or you can help us stop it.

510
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,640
So...

511
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,730
how are we supposed
to get near something

512
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,920
that can smell us 100 yards off?

513
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,600
We don't.

514
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,630
The pack leader.

515
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,450
We're taking him down?

516
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,420
Yeah. Got a better idea?

517
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,840
No, I...

518
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,000
Crowley's not gonna be
too happy about that.

519
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,380
Who gives a rat's ass?

520
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,540
We let that thing live one second,

521
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,150
and it sends out that
psychic dog whistle and pchew!

522
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,210
On the other hand, it could
lead us to an Alpha,

523
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,290
then Crowley would
give me my soul back.

524
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,510
Are you kidding?

525
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,730
150 people turned into monsters.
That's what you want?

526
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,840
No. Of course not. I...

527
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,260
I'm just asking.

528
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,860
All right, you know what? That's it.

529
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,720
What?

530
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,820
You say you're "Just folks," Yeah?

531
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,760
That... that you like baseball
and apple-pie or whatever.

532
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,040
But truth is, I don't know what you are

533
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,760
- 'cause you're not Sam.
- Dean, come on.

534
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,120
I mean, it's your gigantor body and...

535
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,210
and maybe your brain,

536
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,260
but it's not you.

537
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,080
So just... stop pretending

538
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,500
and do us both a favor.

539
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,560
He looks nervous, right?

540
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,300
Wouldn't you be?

541
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,080
I'd double-cross us.

542
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,130
I mean, he's got to realize
that's his best bet,

543
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,550
if he wants to keep breathing.

544
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,790
Nah, he'll go through with it.

545
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,150
You mean 'cause he
loves that family?

546
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,770
Yeah.

547
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,160
I'd double-cross us.

548
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,530
Thanks, Dexter. That's reassuring.

549
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,050
Just making conversation.

550
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,940
Here we go.

551
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,630
That big guy, the driver...

552
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,550
that's the guy Lucky met in the park.

553
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,580
And there's El Jefe.

554
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,720
Take him out.

555
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,890
It's not clean.

556
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,400
We got one shot at this... literally.

557
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,100
Take the shot.

558
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,310
I'm trying!

559
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,290
- She's in the way.
- Take it anyway!

560
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,060
Come on, come on, come on. Ahh.

561
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,500
So, plan "B"?

562
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,160
We've got one?

563
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,230
[Voice breaking]
Please, whatever you want.

564
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,220
Just please let my son go.

[Whispering indistinctly]

566
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,690
Look, man, there's nothing I can do.

567
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,050
The boss is pissed.

568
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,930
These murders that you've been doing?

569
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,860
You didn't ask for permission!

570
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,730
Now you're gonna screw up
the whole damn plan.

571
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,060
- I tried to warn you.
- I know. I'm sorry.

572
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,670
There... there's been a mistake.

573
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,120
T-This has got nothing to do with us.

574
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,260
It has everything
to do with you, sister.

575
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,620
So, you with us or not?

576
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,540
Yes, of course I am.

577
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,110
Fine. Prove it.

578
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,320
Turn them. Now.

579
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,250
Both of 'em, while we watch,

580
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,980
or I'll kill you all.

581
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,040
Oh, my...

582

[Sniffing]

583
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,300

[Gunshot]

586
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,820
- Mommy!
- It's okay.

[Sobs]

588
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,970
Mandy! Come on, come on.

589
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,570
Who are you?!
I don't even know you!

590
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,130
Yes, you do. Trust me, I'm trying to help.

591
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,180
Come on, come on!
[Whimpers]

592
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,700
[Grunts] Get in there.

593
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,830
- But I don't...
- Get in there!

594
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,420
Bolt it! Bolt it!

595
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,980
Here, baby, go under here.

596
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,570
Okay, stay there, honey.
You'll be safe.

597
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:42,225
[Dog barking, snarling]

598
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,360
You're protecting them?

599
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,090
After what I did for you?

600
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,470
I gave you your life back!

601
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,060
[Echoing] Them?

602
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,970
You're nothing to them.

603
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,260
You're a dog.

604
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:19,713
Ohh.

605
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,631
[Laughs]

606
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,260
I-I was gonna turn them.

607
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,650
But now I'm gonna kill 'em.

608
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,470
Aah!

609
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:48,908
[Bones crunching, flesh squishing]

610
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,150
[Barking]
Lucky?!

611
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,250
So you think this is
gonna be a dogfight?

612
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:55,382
[Barking continues]

613
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,350
I got a better idea.

614
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:00,470
[Whimpers]
Ohh!

615
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,660
Silver bullet, Lucky.

616

[Exhales sharply]

619
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:19,690
Ugh.

620
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:21,608
Hi.

621
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,420
Look... [Sighs]

622
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,460
I'm not here to bother you.

623
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,970
I just... uh, I just
want to say one thing.

624
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,330
You and Aidan...

625
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,130
you're the only family I ever had
[Scoffs]

626
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,060
And I know...

627
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,720
I know that sounds... I know...

628
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,980
I know what I am.

629
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,630
It...

630
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,790
it's just that no one has ever
been so nice to me before,

631
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,790
so...

632
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,830
so, thank you.

633
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,730
Get away from this house,

634
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,340
you psycho.

635
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,890
And if you ever,

636
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,240
ever come near me or my son again,

637
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,410
so help me...

638
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,020
I know I probably deserve...

639
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:23,286
[Flesh squishing]

640
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,500
I'll never look at a dog the same.

641
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,210
Makes you wonder though, huh?

642
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,720
What?

643
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,050
How many packs are out there.

644
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,900
What if they're all just waiting
for the signal, you know?

645
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,810
So... I was thinking.
[Sighs]

646
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,830
You were right.

647
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,890
About?

648
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,680
I'm not your brother.

649
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,040
I'm not Sam.

650
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,850
Okay.

651
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,700
All that "Blah, blah, blah,"
about being the old me?

652
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,950
Crap.

653
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,970
Like Lisa and Ben, right?

654
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,860
I've been acting like I care about them,

655
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,710
but I don't, I couldn't care less.

656
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,570
Is this supposed to make me feel better?

657
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,680
You wanted the real me. This is it.

658
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,870
I don't care about them.

659
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,410
I don't even really care about you.

660
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,460
Except that...

661
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,190
I need your help,

662
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,350
and you're clearly not gonna
stick around for much longer

663
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,200
unless I give it to you straight, so...

664
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,160
I've done a lot worse than you know.

665
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,630
I've killed innocent people
in the line of duty.

666
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,810
But I'm pretty sure

667
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,900
it's not something the
old me could've done.

668
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,100
And maybe I should feel guilty,

669
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,960
but I don't.

670
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,490
Sam, get to the punch line.

671
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,470
I don't know if how I am

672
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,770
is better or worse.

673
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,000
It's different.

674
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,940
You get the job done
and nothing really hurts.

675
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,650
That's not the worst thing.

676
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,860
But I've been thinking,

677
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,860
I was that other
Sam for a long time

678
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,180
and it was...

679
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,760
it was kinda harder.

680
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,380
But there are also things
about it I remember that I...

681
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,921
[Sighs]

682
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,620
let's just say

683
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,530
I think I should probably
go back to being him.

684
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,990
That's very interesting.

685
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,440
It's a step.

686
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,570
So?

687
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,280
We do what we got to do.

688
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,490
And we get my brother back.
