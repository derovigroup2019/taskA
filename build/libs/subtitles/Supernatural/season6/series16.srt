1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,901
- Rufus Turner is a hunter.
- One of your old friends?

2
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:05,069
Oh, good. You're home.

3
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:06,620
Listen, you got to help me
bury a body.

4
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:08,122
It's just something
Samuel's been doing.

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,990
Catching things,
taking them somewhere,

6
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:11,208
grilling them for info.

7
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:12,300
Grill.

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,360
Torture, right?

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,748
You sold us out?

10
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:19,967
<i>What exactly are you
supposed to be to me?</i>

11
00:00:20,034 --> 00:00:21,302
I'll tell you who I am.

12
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:22,836
I'm the guy
you never want to see again.

13
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:25,005
The next time you see me,

14
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:27,308
I'll be there to kill you.

15
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,225
- Hey.
- Hi.

16
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,843
Gwen Campbell.
Third cousin.

17
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:31,595
They grew up in the life,
like us.

18
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,147
I'm thinking you know
"Purgatory."

19
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:36,517
This is all about opening a door
to let something in.

20
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:38,385
- What?
- I'm working on it.

21
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:39,403
Could you give us something?

22
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:40,988
I got a name.
"Mother of all."

23
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:42,356
We have so much to do.

24
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:44,692
Let's get started.

25
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:03,127
Whoa.

26
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,128
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:05,579
Did I scare you?

28
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:10,584
You okay?

29
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:12,102
You look a little...

30
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:14,554
Well, I could use a ride.

31
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:19,559
Okay.

32
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:23,063
So, what's your name,
sweetheart?

33
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:26,116
- Eve.
- Eve. I'm Rick.

34
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:27,267
So, how far you going, Eve?

35
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,787
However far you want.

36
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:37,328
Whoa, whoa. Eve.

37
00:01:37,412 --> 00:01:40,414
Look, you're very pretty,

38
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,082
but this is not
what's right for you.

39
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:43,116
Trust me.

40
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,284
Then what's right for me?

41
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:51,558
This emptiness
you feel inside...

42
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:53,310
it's really a hunger for him.

43
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:55,095
You do know that Jesus
was just a man.

44
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:57,181
Sure, but he was
also the son of God,

45
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:59,016
sent here because he loves us.

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,700
- God doesn't care about you.
- Sure he does.

47
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:04,471
Your father made you
and then abandoned you,

48
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:08,025
so you pray.

49
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:09,827
You see signs
where there's nothing.

50
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:13,414
But truth is,
your apocalypse came and went,

51
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,499
and you didn't even notice.

52
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:19,620
A mother would never abandon
her children like he did.

53
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:21,038
You'll see.

54
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:22,623
See what?

55
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:24,541
Can I tell you a secret?

56
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:34,134
Aah! Aah!

57
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,498
Aah!

58
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,287
   Season 6 Episode 16
"And Then There Were None"

59
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:18,679
I've been getting blasts
from hunters all week.

60
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,247
Nest of vamps.

61
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:23,150
Werewolf dance party.

62
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:25,385
Shifters, six of them.

63
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:27,488
Two hunters died
taking them out.

64
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:29,890
Ghouls, ghouls.

65
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:32,743
Ghoul-wraith smorgasbord.

66
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:34,828
Is it just me, or is that
a straight kick-line down I-80?

67
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,730
Exactly.

68
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:39,065
Looks to me like it's
a Sherman march monster mash.

69
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:41,084
Yeah, but where are they
marching to?

70
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:43,737
What is it?

71
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:45,873
Guy bashes in
his family's heads.

72
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:54,581
It's like I told the cops.

73
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:56,416
I blacked out.

74
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:59,069
Well, just tell us
what you do remember.

75
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,087
Driving my regular route,

76
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,159
and then I... I woke up
in my truck at work.

77
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:06,643
And where's work?

78
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:08,562
Starlight Cannery.

79
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:11,999
I... I didn't remember
how I got there...

80
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,284
So I called home.

81
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:17,955
When no one picked up,

82
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,741
I... I went there,
and I found...

83
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,876
Anything unusual
before you blacked out?

84
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:26,497
Sights, smells,
anything off the routine?

85
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:29,049
No. Basic night.

86
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:31,585
I was giving some kid
from the truck stop a ride.

87
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:33,954
She took off.

88
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:36,590
I... I think she took off.

89
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:38,625
Anything else?

90
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:40,344
I swear...
I didn't mean to do it.

91
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:43,630
I... I loved them.

92
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:48,485
So, demon possession or ghosts?

93
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,187
I thought this was
a monster thing.

94
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:51,638
All right, here we go.

95
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,690
Truck stop,
night of the murders.

96
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:57,860
That's him.

97
00:05:00,164 --> 00:05:02,282
Hmm. Hello.

98
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:08,022
Freakish nightmare.
What the hell was that?

99
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:09,162
Bobby?

100
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:11,258
I've never seen that
in my life.

101
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:13,794
All those vamps and ghouls
out on I-80...

102
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:15,679
maybe they're coming in
for mother's day.

103
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,551
Um...

104
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:24,888
<i>Okay, well,
if that is big mama...</i>

105
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:26,640
whatever she is,

106
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:28,275
we got zero on ganking her.

107
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:30,811
So what are we gonna do if we
run into her? Throw salt and hope?

108
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:33,346
No, we're gonna turn tail and run,
because we're in over our heads.

109
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:35,282
I mean, we better get
some real info on this bitch...

110
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:36,850
...before we do run into her.

111
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,068
Hey, let's go.

112
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:42,322
What's the ruckus?

113
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:45,042
A guy just went postal
down at the cannery.

114
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:47,694
Okay, I'll go.
You finish here.

115
00:05:58,423 --> 00:06:01,041
Excuse me.

116
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,686
FBI. Willis.

117
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:14,187
- How many in there?
- Six dead.

118
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:15,856
- What happened?
- Apparently, a guy walks in,

119
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:18,224
pulls a hunting rifle,
just opens fire.

120
00:06:18,276 --> 00:06:19,743
Captain!
This is agent...

121
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:21,445
What? There a fed convention
in town or something?

122
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:22,913
I beg your pardon.

123
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:24,414
Agent Willis?

124
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:27,400
Am I right?

125
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:29,202
Agent.

126
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,372
I wasn't expecting you... yet.

127
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:34,741
Well, apparently,
you didn't get the call.

128
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:38,428
Gentlemen, can you excuse us?

129
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:41,298
What in the high holy
are you doing here, Rufus?

130
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:43,884
Same as you...
tracking 31 flavors of crazy,

131
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:46,186
which led us both smack
into the middle of this.

132
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:47,421
Right. Huh.

133
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:49,806
Can we talk to the perp?

134
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:51,391
Well, we can give it a shot.

135
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:53,644
I don't know if he's gonna talk
back to us, though.

136
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:56,429
Cops put eight bullets in him.

137
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,116
So...

138
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,201
So what?

139
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:03,819
So are we partnering
on this or not?

140
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:06,740
Come on, man.
It's not rocket surgery.

141
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:07,941
We're here.
Let's do this.

142
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:10,627
Just like old times.

143
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:11,995
Long as I get to drive.

144
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,082
Hell no.

145
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,955
So, do you think the mother
of whatever the hell

146
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:26,893
is wrapped up in this, Bobby?

147
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:28,595
Looks like.

148
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,514
These are just guys
going berserk, Bobby.

149
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:32,482
How is that a monster thing?

150
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,986
I don't know. That's why
we're hacking him open.

151
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:44,310
Hand me one of those
swab things over there.

152
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:59,826
What have you got?

153
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:01,678
That ecto?

154
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,135
That's not ecto.

155
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:12,439
What the hell is that?

156
00:08:12,506 --> 00:08:14,608
It's something new.

157
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:18,061
New?
No such thing as new, Bobby.

158
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:19,512
Well, it's something.

159
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:23,400
Those guys who snapped,

160
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:25,569
one thing they had in common...

161
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:28,538
they both worked
at that cannery joint.

162
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:48,208
I don't even know
why you have a driver's license.

163
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:50,560
Well, look
what the cat dragged in.

164
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:52,479
It really is good
to see you, Rufus.

165
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:53,563
I can believe it.

166
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,015
It must get old

167
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,484
dealing with this miserable
cuss here all by yourself.

168
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:58,769
Is it that obvious?

169
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:00,520
Why don't you three get a room?

170
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,156
- All right, we all pack a snack?
- Yeah.

171
00:09:03,224 --> 00:09:04,390
Let's see what we can see.

172
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:47,734
- Gwen?
- Dean.

173
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:56,776
Welcome to the "next time."

174
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:57,961
No, no, no, no!
Hold on!

175
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:59,779
- I said I'd kill him!
- Look, just a second.

176
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:05,168
I take it you know each other.

177
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:08,171
- He's our grandfather.
- Oh.

178
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:10,457
Somebody needs a hug.

179
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:11,675
Why are you here?

180
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,960
We're working. You?

181
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:15,145
None of your damn business!

182
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:16,513
Sam, take Dean for a walk.

183
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:18,481
- You got to be kidding me.
- Look, Dean, it's fine.

184
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:20,633
How?

185
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:32,478
- What is wrong with you?
- Look, maybe he knows something.

186
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,364
- You don't remember what he did. I do.
- I know.

187
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:36,666
I'm not saying don't.
I'm saying not yet.

188
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:50,180
So... you're Samuel.

189
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:52,832
You must be the guy
pretending to be their father.

190
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,968
Well, somebody ought to.

191
00:10:57,655 --> 00:11:00,273
Sam.

192
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:02,192
You're looking well.

193
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,393
Save the small talk, all right?

194
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:06,730
You seem different.

195
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:08,732
I got my soul back.

196
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:10,016
No thanks to you, I hear.

197
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,018
You hear?

198
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:15,688
You don't remember.

199
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,357
I remember enough.

200
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:21,461
I, uh, really hate to break up
this little circle of love,

201
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:23,880
but why don't we
talk shop, huh?

202
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:26,032
How about you tell us
what it is you're hunting?

203
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:32,722
A creature from Purgatory.

204
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,374
She calls herself Eve.

205
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:36,092
- Eve?
- Yep.

206
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:38,728
They call her Mother.

207
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:41,681
She was here
about 10,000 years ago.

208
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,149
Every freak that walks
the face of the earth

209
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:45,185
can be traced back to her.

210
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:46,770
And she's back.

211
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:48,321
How the hell
do you know all that?

212
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:50,190
You don't know half the things
that I know, kid.

213
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:53,109
Hell, until recently,
you didn't even know about us.

214
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:56,062
I now know that you'd throw
your own kin to hungry ghouls.

215
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:58,031
I think I know enough.

216
00:11:58,082 --> 00:12:00,896
- You what?
- Dean lied to the man.

217
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:05,552
- How about you ask Dean?
- Good idea.

218
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,514
Dean.

219
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:17,465
- Is it true?
- What?

220
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,352
Did Samuel really try to...

221
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,771
Kill me? Yes.

222
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:24,607
He didn't even blink.

223
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:26,860
That's the guy
you're rolling with.

224
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:28,611
He didn't tell me
anything about that.

225
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,096
I didn't know.

226
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:33,450
I know.

227
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,238
Honestly, there's something
I need to tell you.

228
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:39,272
What?

229
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:58,174
See if you can plug
that hole up, Bobby.

230
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,234
Come on, girl!

231
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,787
Come on!

232
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:14,459
Come on!

233
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,376
Come on!

234
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,047
She's gone.

235
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,550
Ah, damn it.

236
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:29,824
I'm sorry... if you care.

237
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,225
Screw you. I care.

238
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,717
Is she, uh...

239
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,285
Yeah.

240
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,121
- Where's Dean?
- I couldn't find him.

241
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:46,007
Whatever got into those guys
must have got into Dean.

242
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:50,378
Rufus, help Samuel
move her somewhere.

243
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:52,663
Sam and I will lock down here.

244
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,633
We're gonna want to find Dean
before he finds us.

245
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,005
We're gonna find him
alive, Samuel,

246
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,673
or I'm gonna put a bullet
into your head.

247
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,081
Dean, put that damn thing down.

248
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,087
Dean, put it down.

249
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,606
You're the least of my worries
right now, Rufus.

250
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,810
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay, both of you.

251
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,561
- Both of us, my ass.
- I'm not in the mood.

252
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:33,347
I just had a 12-inch... herpe
crawl out of my ear.

253
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:36,267
- What?
- You heard me.

254
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,568
I just woke up on the ground,

255
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:42,440
just in time to see this...
this... worm thing

256
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,859
sliding out of my freaking ear
and into that vent.

257
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,577
So you tell me
what the hell's going on!

258
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:49,513
You killed Gwen.
That's what's going on.

259
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,733
We were just talking
out in the hallway.

260
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,452
That's the last thing
I remember.

261
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,903
That thing must have jumped me.

262
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,574
So, we're talking about, like,
a monster that gets in you?

263
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,627
It's like a Khan worm
on steroids.

264
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,179
You mean like a parasite, something
that took over your body.

265
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:06,547
Worm crawls in you,
worm crawls out.

266
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,684
Monster possession?
That's novel.

267
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,136
Or that thing's still in you, and we
can't trust a word that you're saying.

268
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,354
- It's not!
- Check your ear.

269
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,441
What do you mean, check my ear?

270
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:18,893
Check my ear for what?

271
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,028
Hey! What?

272
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:22,813
Why don't you buy me
a drink first?

273
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,566
Second date.
Oh, yeah, we're goo positive.

274
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,201
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

275
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:28,602
That means it was in you,
all right.

276
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,538
- Or it still is.
- It's not in me!

277
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:31,906
Okay.

278
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,125
- Everybody, give up your guns.
- What?

279
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:36,544
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
think about this for a second, Bobby.

280
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:38,612
I'm thinking we don't know
who is and who ain't got

281
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,081
the damn Khan worm
up inside his melon.

282
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,165
It's not in me!

283
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,383
I didn't say it was.

284
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,336
Point is we don't know
who it is.

285
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,922
It could be any one of us.

286
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:51,259
So the best we can do...
is to make it that much harder

287
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,512
for that thing to blow
our fool heads off.

288
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,877
Are you waiting for
a handwritten invite, Campbell?

289
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,734
Okay.

290
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,120
We need some time to breathe,
make a plan.

291
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:56,157
A plan?

292
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,358
Based on?

293
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,043
I'm gonna make
a few phone calls,

294
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:01,495
see if anybody ever heard
of anything like this.

295
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:04,465
Hmm. Ditto.

296
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:06,884
Got a few trees I can shake.

297
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:09,420
Oh, balls, Callard.

298
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:12,039
No, I told you that.

299
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,595
Oh, Damn it.

300
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,226
Relax.

301
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,195
Bathroom break.

302
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,030
So unless you want
to hold it for me...

303
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:58,252
Well, I got a dump truck
full of bubkes.

304
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,223
Nothing here, either.
You call Willie?

305
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,808
Of course.
Think I'm an idjit?

306
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,027
How about Rodg?

307
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:07,445
Wouldn't talk to me.

308
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:08,762
Yeah, me neither.

309
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,450
Okay, plan "B."

310
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,037
Let's just go
and grab the thing.

311
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:17,538
And then what, exactly?

312
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:21,442
Well, we sit on our thumbs,
or we go in guns blazing.

313
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,560
Like Omaha?

314
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:26,047
You know what?

315
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:28,716
Screw you for bringing up Omaha.

316
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,617
That's just low.

317
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,188
What?

318
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,525
Nothing. I'm just wondering
how you sleep at night.

319
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,160
Like a baby.
Thanks for asking.

320
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:58,195
You fed us to Crowley.

321
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,283
True, but what am I gonna do
about it now?

322
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,485
Do I blame you
for wanting to kill me?

323
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,504
Of course not, Dean.
What I did was...

324
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,594
But I'm not apologizing.

325
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:16,881
I did what I did.
I don't cry over spilled blood.

326
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,718
So you really can
just go on, like...

327
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,553
Just because you're Dr. Jekyll
at the moment

328
00:20:22,637 --> 00:20:24,004
doesn't mean you can get
all high and mighty.

329
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,723
Don't forget,
we spent a year together.

330
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,726
Yeah, we did. We're blood.
And you still sold me out.

331
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,846
Trust me, what I did pales
in comparison to what you did,

332
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,449
and on more than one occasion.

333
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:36,683
All right, tell me what I did.

334
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,885
No. Sam, come on.

335
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:42,156
The only reason
you're alive right now

336
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,991
is because we're working a job.

337
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:48,362
The minute we kill this thing...
you're next.

338
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,667
Okay, then.

339
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,202
We'll just see.

340
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,514
I heard a shot.

341
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,183
Samuel!

342
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,853
I'm gonna be needing
my gun back now, Bobby.

343
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,772
- You think?
- Yeah.

344
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:23,831
Hey, don't feel bad.

345
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:25,115
You know, it was a good plan,

346
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,451
except for the part
where a monster

347
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,286
would definitely, definitely
not give up all his weapons.

348
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,588
Shut up.

349
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:32,239
We lost him.

350
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,678
- So, what's the plan?
- We stick together.

351
00:21:37,745 --> 00:21:40,246
We got to keep track
of this thing, who it's in.

352
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,364
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

353
00:21:57,432 --> 00:21:58,899
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

354
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,951
Hold on. Look.

355
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,005
Booby trap.

356
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,456
I'll be damned.

357
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,304
Hey! Hey! Whoa!

358
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,656
Dean!

359
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,990
Sam!

360
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:41,475
Damn it.

361
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,279
Son of a bitch.

362
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,196
- Dean?
- Sam!

363
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,781
I'm gonna go around, okay?

364
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:48,749
All right.
Watch yourself.

365
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:50,117
Yeah.

366
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,622
Come on.

367
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:14,174
Don't move.

368
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:15,192
Sam.

369
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:17,511
Put your gun down.

370
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,848
What you gonna do, son?

371
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,017
You're not gonna shoot me.

372
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,070
You got your soul back.

373
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,454
You gonna shoot
your own family?

374
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:28,855
Yeah, I wouldn't go
with the family thing.

375
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,407
Try again.

376
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,209
Mary's still my daughter.

377
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:33,860
I said don't move.

378
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,212
You're still named after me.

379
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:37,197
I said don't move!

380
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,719
Appears to be our moment, Sam.

381
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:46,223
You still want to know
about your summer vacation?

382
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:48,892
I'll tell you all about it.

383
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:51,228
You're dying to know, huh?

384
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:53,847
Yeah, I am.

385
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:58,385
Well, then, let's just
put these down and talk.

386
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,219
Stop.

387
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,187
It's all right, Sam.

388
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,036
Sam.

389
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,036
Sam!

390
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:34,187
Oh, thank God.

391
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:42,278
Drop the gun, Sam.

392
00:24:52,506 --> 00:24:53,489
It's me.

393
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,491
Okay.

394
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,160
That's great, Sam.

395
00:24:57,211 --> 00:25:03,049
Just got to cuff you, uh,
till we can be sure, okay?

396
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:04,684
You understand, right?

397
00:25:04,752 --> 00:25:06,702
<i>It's in him.</i>

398
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:07,920
Are you sure?

399
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:12,592
Yeah. Yeah, I think.

400
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,296
You see anything come out of him...
after he dropped?

401
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:28,274
Tell me you got something.

402
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,743
Nothing.

403
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:33,446
What?

404
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,932
So... so you mean he wasn't
a monster when I ganked him?

405
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:40,837
One way to find out.

406
00:25:40,904 --> 00:25:42,922
Bobby, you got a cranial saw
in the car?

407
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:44,123
Of course.

408
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,441
You're not going alone.

409
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:47,210
Oh, no, he won't.
He won't.

410
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:50,096
We will both go grab some tools

411
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,348
and see about getting
some power in this place.

412
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,267
And I want you and you to...

413
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:57,253
Okay, I want you and you
to watch him and him and...

414
00:25:57,304 --> 00:25:59,105
all right, if anything crawls
out of anybody,

415
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:00,390
somebody step on it.

416
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:03,693
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll watch Samuel.

417
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,111
Dean will watch me.

418
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:29,052
You did the right thing,
you know.

419
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:35,341
You mean you think I did,
if it's in him and I'm me.

420
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:39,512
This thing's playing
three-card Monte with us.

421
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,764
Well, I'm just gonna assume
you're you.

422
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:44,800
You want to take this
off, then?

423
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:49,972
Not till we get that sucker
out of his walnut.

424
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:53,476
I don't know.

425
00:26:53,527 --> 00:26:56,612
I mean, I barely remember him,

426
00:26:56,663 --> 00:27:01,084
and what I do remember...
it's not good.

427
00:27:01,151 --> 00:27:04,153
And what he did to us...

428
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:05,188
But...

429
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:07,156
There's a "but"?

430
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:11,094
I mean, I just can't help
but think...

431
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:12,161
What would mom say?

432
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,386
You know what I think
mom would say?

433
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:23,139
She'd say just 'cause you're
blood doesn't make you family.

434
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:25,691
You got to earn that.

435
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:39,622
Well...
All right.

436
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:41,073
Let's play operation.

437
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:46,579
- You boys want to take a breather?
- We're good.

438
00:27:46,663 --> 00:27:48,831
We're about to crack open
your grandpa's grapefruit.

439
00:27:48,882 --> 00:27:50,032
Take a breather.

440
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:17,243
What is this? Have you been
dumpster-diving again?

441
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:18,611
What? It still works.

442
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:19,996
Yeah, right.

443
00:28:20,063 --> 00:28:23,166
Hope so.

444
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:26,586
Listen, Rufus,
I've been thinking.

445
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,287
Yeah, will wonders never cease?

446
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:32,091
Yeah, s... shut up a minute.
I'm trying to say something.

447
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:38,431
It was my fault...
Omaha.

448
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,017
No. No, it wasn't.

449
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:42,802
No, I should... I should
have listened to you.

450
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,854
Well, hey,
that's categorical, Bobby.

451
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:49,392
I... l... let me
just get this out.

452
00:28:49,443 --> 00:28:52,228
Bobby, we've had this
conversation already, okay?

453
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,364
No, we haven't.
I never said I'm sorry, Rufus.

454
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:57,733
I... you lost her
because of me, and I...

455
00:28:57,784 --> 00:29:01,770
Bobby, I said we've had
this conversation already.

456
00:29:01,822 --> 00:29:05,608
And you could blabber all day...

457
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:07,777
And it wouldn't
change a thing, Bobby.

458
00:29:13,634 --> 00:29:17,470
I will never forgive you
for what happened.

459
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:21,224
You got that?

460
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:24,143
Never.

461
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,564
So change the subject, Bob.

462
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:02,498
Dean.

463
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:06,898
Jesus!

464
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:33,663
Bobby, you okay?
Rufus.

465
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:35,915
- Rufus. Rufus.
- Hey, you all right?

466
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:36,999
Wake up.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

467
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:37,866
- It's all right.
- I got you.

468
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:38,867
Come on.

469
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:41,921
You okay?

470
00:30:42,005 --> 00:30:44,006
This can't be my afterlife

471
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:45,708
'cause the three of you
are here.

472
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,843
What happened?

473
00:30:47,894 --> 00:30:50,479
Well, when we left,
he was dead on the table.

474
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:52,665
Yeah, till he wasn't.

475
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:55,101
So how did he get double dead?

476
00:30:55,185 --> 00:30:56,352
Bobby threw him against that.

477
00:30:56,403 --> 00:30:57,520
I guess it was a live wire.

478
00:30:57,571 --> 00:31:01,107
It shorted, and he went ape.

479
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:03,409
Then that thing
crawled out of his ear.

480
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,444
At least we know
what tickles it.

481
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,062
Electricity.

482
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:09,732
Yeah. Now the question is,
where'd it go?

483
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:11,784
- You see?
- No.

484
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,753
- You two were down for the count.
- Yeah.

485
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:18,240
Well, either it bailed
or it's in either one of you.

486
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,412
Or... it's in one of you.

487
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:24,964
No, we were awake.

488
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:27,750
- Did you have eyes on each other?
- Yes.

489
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:30,353
100% of the time?

490
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,304
Define a 100.

491
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:34,774
Like I said.

492
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:38,444
All right, how about, uh,
check for goo, right?

493
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:46,268
Nothing.

494
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:53,275
It might just be gone.

495
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:55,277
No.

496
00:31:55,345 --> 00:31:57,329
It might have wised up
and covered its trail.

497
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,665
All right, 
let's settle this... 100%.

498
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,283
How?

499
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:12,011
You're live.

500
00:32:12,095 --> 00:32:14,480
Okay.

501
00:32:27,227 --> 00:32:28,527
All right.

502
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:35,117
Yeah.

503
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:39,505
Okay.

504
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:43,509
I'm not a doctor, but I'm gonna
go ahead and call this one.

505
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:46,262
Yeah. All right, who
wants to go first?

506
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:50,433
- Come on.
- You sure?

507
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,801
Hurry up before I start
thinking...

508
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:56,222
Son of a...

509
00:32:57,307 --> 00:33:00,943
Whew. Awesome.

510
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,061
Here, you want me to...

511
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:11,320
Let's go.

512
00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:12,238
Yep.

513
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:15,658
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

514
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:16,709
Uh, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

515
00:33:16,793 --> 00:33:18,878
No passes, Rufus.
Come on.

516
00:33:18,962 --> 00:33:21,914
- I got a damn pacemaker.
- Well, you better hope it's a good one.

517
00:33:21,998 --> 00:33:23,966
Since when do you got
a pacemaker?

518
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:26,302
Since Bush Jr. Term one.

519
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:28,787
I'm down three toes,
too, F.Y.I.

520
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:31,540
All right, come on.
Just make it quick.

521
00:33:35,395 --> 00:33:37,179
God!

522
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,264
God!

523
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:41,100
Damn it! Damn it!

524
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:43,269
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

525
00:33:43,353 --> 00:33:44,687
Give me that.

526
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:47,022
Okay.

527
00:33:47,073 --> 00:33:48,274
All right, my turn.

528
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:52,611
Well, it ain't inside me,
so go right ahead.

529
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:54,914
All right, then just
stand still, Bobby.

530
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,415
Okay, sure.

531
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,917
- I'll make this quick.
- No problem.

532
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:59,285
All right?
Let's do this.

533
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:01,253
Okay, uh, just a second, Rufus.

534
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:04,957
Just a second nothing,
whatever you are.

535
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,792
I'm Bobby.

536
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,010
Bobby, my ass.

537
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,430
Bobby!

538
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:15,430
Rufus!

539
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:28,869
Bobby, there are two of us
and one of you.

540
00:34:48,907 --> 00:34:51,525
Well, hey, there,
you little herpe.

541
00:34:57,365 --> 00:34:58,899
Why do you keep talking
about herpes?

542
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,717
What?

543
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,202
I don't. Shut up.

544
00:35:03,455 --> 00:35:05,256
Shut up.

545
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:10,294
Now, don't you even think
about shagging ass out of here,

546
00:35:10,378 --> 00:35:13,047
'cause we got every crack
in this room sealed.

547
00:35:13,098 --> 00:35:14,348
So get comfy.

548
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:15,749
I am comfy.

549
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,186
It's nice in here.

550
00:35:19,254 --> 00:35:23,223
And you love this guy,
don't you?

551
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:28,362
You really want to kill me
and take him with me?

552
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:31,448
Haven't you lost
enough pals today?

553
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:32,783
We'll do what we have to do.

554
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,202
And we got some questions
for you,

555
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:36,904
so you can either play ball,

556
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:39,773
or we could fry up a little
shrimp on the Barbie.

557
00:35:39,824 --> 00:35:44,378
Ask. Been waiting
for you to ask.

558
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:46,413
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

559
00:35:46,464 --> 00:35:50,250
It means I got nothing to hide.

560
00:35:50,302 --> 00:35:51,552
What are you?

561
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:54,221
You haven't got a name
for me yet.

562
00:35:54,288 --> 00:35:57,174
I'm new around here.

563
00:35:57,258 --> 00:35:59,977
Eve cooked me up herself.

564
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:12,106
Who is she, this Eve bitch?

565
00:36:12,157 --> 00:36:14,808
The mother of all of us

566
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:17,795
and the end of all of you.

567
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:19,613
By the time she's done,

568
00:36:19,664 --> 00:36:23,500
there'll be more creatures
than humans.

569
00:36:23,585 --> 00:36:26,286
You'll live in pens.

570
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:29,873
We'll serve up your young
and call it veal.

571
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,875
And what's your deal
in all of this?

572
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,677
I mean, how's jumping
a few truckers gonna help?

573
00:36:33,762 --> 00:36:35,295
You think I'm here

574
00:36:35,347 --> 00:36:38,465
to mess with a couple
of cannery workers?

575
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:40,050
We led you here.

576
00:36:40,118 --> 00:36:41,018
Why?

577
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:43,971
She has a message for you.

578
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:45,806
Oh, yeah? What's that?

579
00:36:45,857 --> 00:36:48,559
You're all gonna die.

580
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:52,780
She's pissed. She's here.

581
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:55,733
And it's gonna be
nothing but pain

582
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:59,570
for you from here on in.

583
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:02,322
Well, here's my response.

584
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:08,462
Dean.

585
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,464
Dean!

586
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:16,053
How much more do you think
he can take?

587
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:21,008
You can't kill me,
not without taking him with me.

588
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:27,314
Well... we'll just have to do

589
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:29,316
what Bobby would want us to do.

590
00:37:43,397 --> 00:37:45,199
No way out now, slug-o.

591
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:51,205
Bobby, hang on in there.

592
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:11,091
Bobby?

593
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:12,392
Is he, uh...

594
00:38:12,444 --> 00:38:13,694
Hey, hey.

595
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,265
Whoa.

596
00:38:18,316 --> 00:38:20,117
Bobby.

597
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:22,202
Bobby, hey.

598
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,655
He's not breathing.
Bobby!

599
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:45,195
I got to say,

600
00:38:45,263 --> 00:38:47,597
I never figured Rufus
for the religious type.

601
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:50,484
Well, he didn't
exactly keep kosher.

602
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:52,486
He always used to pull

603
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,204
the old "can't work
on the sabbath" card

604
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:56,439
whenever we had to bury a body.

605
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:05,716
You know, I... I was just a job.

606
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:10,220
I was Joe mechanic.

607
00:39:10,288 --> 00:39:14,007
Then my wife got possessed...

608
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:17,578
went nuts on me.

609
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:21,565
I stabbed her,
and that didn't stop her.

610
00:39:21,632 --> 00:39:26,403
Next thing I knew,
this guy comes busting in,

611
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,305
soaks her with holy water,

612
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:31,475
and sends that demon
straight to hell so fast.

613
00:39:33,862 --> 00:39:35,746
I'd have gone away
for killing her.

614
00:39:35,813 --> 00:39:38,999
But...

615
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:42,669
Rufus cleaned up everything.

616
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:47,991
Taught me a thing
or two about...

617
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:52,462
what's really out there.

618
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:55,165
Pretty soon,
we were riding together.

619
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:57,384
Worked like that for years.

620
00:39:57,468 --> 00:40:01,171
Kind of like
you two knuckleheads.

621
00:40:01,222 --> 00:40:02,940
So, what happened?

622
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,345
It was Omaha.

623
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:12,182
It was my fault.

624
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:14,284
And he never let it go.

625
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:15,903
Well, he should have.

626
00:40:15,987 --> 00:40:17,454
You don't know
what I did, Dean.

627
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:19,122
Doesn't matter.

628
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,408
What do you mean, it doesn't...

629
00:40:21,492 --> 00:40:24,361
I mean at the end of the day,
you two are family.

630
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:27,681
Life's short, and ours
are shorter than most.

631
00:40:27,749 --> 00:40:31,051
We're gonna spend it
wringing our hands?

632
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:34,304
Something's gonna
get us eventually,

633
00:40:34,372 --> 00:40:36,539
and when my guts
get ripped out,

634
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:39,476
just so you two know,
we're good.

635
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:41,895
Blanket apology
for all the crap

636
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,313
that anybody's done
all the way around.

637
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:45,048
Some of us pulled
a lot of crap, Dean.

638
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:47,517
Well, clean slate.

639
00:40:52,106 --> 00:40:52,990
Okay.
