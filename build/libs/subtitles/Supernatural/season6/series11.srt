1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,449
Death...

2
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:06,376
he's gonna be there.

3
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:08,874
I understand you want this.

4
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:10,320
There are conditions.

5
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:12,657
You know
you can't cheat death.

6
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:15,173
I don't think
it's killing people.

7
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:17,458
I think it's taking them
when their time is just up.

8
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:18,726
A reaper.

9
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:20,928
You're much prettier
than the last reaper I met.

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,513
So, this is the reaper
that came after you.

11
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:24,265
- Dean.
- Tessa.

12
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,267
- Balthazar.
- Why you buying up human souls?

13
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,536
Do you have any idea
what souls are worth?

14
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:30,021
What power they hold?

15
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,639
Just making sure that you're not
having second thoughts

16
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,007
about getting your soul back.

17
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:36,944
Sam's soul has been
locked in the cage

18
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,846
with Michael and Lucifer.

19
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,164
If we try to force

20
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,617
that mutilated thing
down Sam's gullet,

21
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:44,035
it could be catastrophic.

22
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,336
He needs his soul.

23
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:46,838
Look, we get it back.

24
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:48,840
And if there are complications,

25
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,225
then we will figure out a way
to deal with those, too.

26
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:16,517
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

27
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,360
Hi, I'm, uh, looking for...

28
00:01:26,412 --> 00:01:28,129
Follow all the way back.

29
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:30,665
All the way back.

30
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,654
Dean Winchester?

31
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:58,609
You must be Dr. Robert?

32
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:06,167
Son, I stitched up your daddy
more times than I can count,

33
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:07,835
let me tell you.

34
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:10,254
Oh, it's good to see you.

35
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,206
'Course, that was ages ago,

36
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,876
back when, uh, I still
had my medical license.

37
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,210
Right this way.

38
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:18,913
Well, you know, I'm, uh,

39
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:21,182
I'm no germ freak, but...

40
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:23,684
Rent's cheap.

41
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,195
Eva, my assistant.

42
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:34,862
Hi.

43
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:40,401
Hop right up.

44
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:44,271
N... now, you... you have,
uh, done this a lot?

45
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:45,823
Oh, many, many times.

46
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:48,493
And your... success rate?

47
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:50,628
Oh, excellent... almost 75%.

48
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:55,583
So, should we get the, uh,
preliminaries out of the way?

49
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,951
Yeah. Uh, yeah, right.

50
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:00,637
Ah. Oh.

51
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:03,057
Oh.

52
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:05,292
Uh...

53
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,677
So...

54
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:09,981
Listen, if, uh, something...

55
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:14,298
- Goes wrong?
- Yeah. Uh...

56
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:16,687
Would you mail this for me, please?

57
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,139
Sure.

58
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:22,475
Would've thought you had
something for your brother, Sam.

59
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:25,413
If I don't make it back,

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,282
nothing I say is gonna mean
a damn thing to him.

61
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,823
Ahh!

62
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:37,592
Don't be a baby.

63
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,494
You know, a little
bedside manner would be nice.

64
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:44,298
Are we ready? Hmm?

65
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,358
You've got three minutes.

66
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:12,827
No pulse, no sinus rhythm.

67
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,545
He's dead.

68
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,640
Good times.

69
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,550
This better work.

70
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:40,387
<i>Messorum evoco qui me tetigit.</i>

71
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,322
Dean?

72
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,074
What the hell?

73
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,224
What do you know?
It worked.

74
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:45,576
I was in the Sudan!

75
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,578
What's with yanking me ov...

76
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,730
- Wait, why are you dead?
- Tessa, I need a favor.

77
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:51,365
Oh, you're kidding.
You died to ask me...

78
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,701
- Tell your boss I need to talk to him.
- No.

79
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,086
- Please?
- Where do you get the nerve?

80
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,121
Desperate times.

81
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:59,257
He calls <i>us.</i>
<i>We don't call him.</i>

82
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,841
- You make an exception!
- I can't.

83
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,260
- Can't or won't?!
- Both!

84
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,578
All right, Tessa.
Thank you very much.

85
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,016
Hello, Dean.

86
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:14,472
  Season 6 Episode 11
"Appointment in Samarra"

87
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:21,112
I'm busy, Dean.
Talk fast.

88
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,763
I have something of yours.

89
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:24,098
You mean my ring?

90
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:27,368
I recall loaning you that
temporarily.

91
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:29,103
Well, if you want it back...

92
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,438
I'm sorry,

93
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:32,907
you assume that I don't know
where you've hidden it.

94
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:37,995
Now we've established you have
hubris but no leverage.

95
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,064
What is it you want?

96
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:44,635
Lucifer's cage.

97
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,305
I figure you're one
of the few people

98
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,556
that can actually jailbreak it.

99
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,675
Do you?

100
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,960
Sam's soul is stuck in that box.

101
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:54,846
- I've heard.
- And our other brother

102
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,597
is trapped in there, too.
Michael rode him in.

103
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,517
Dean, quit shuffling and deal.

104
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,985
I want you to get 'em both out.

105
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:05,356
Hmm.

106
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Pick one.

107
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:10,695
What?!

108
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,997
Sam's soul or Adam's.

109
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,150
- But...
- As a rule, I don't bring people back.

110
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:19,203
I might make an exception once,
not twice.

111
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,488
So... pick.

112
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,506
Sam.

113
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,961
His soul has been in there
for a year,

114
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,548
and I understand
that it's... damaged.

115
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:33,434
Try flayed to the raw nerve.

116
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:38,522
Well, is there any way
that you could, uh,

117
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,026
I don't know,
hack the Hell part off?

118
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,314
Four, three, two...

119
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,349
Now.

120
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,687
Again.

121
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:57,124
Dean, Dean, Dean.

122
00:06:57,192 --> 00:06:59,877
What do you think the soul is?

123
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,512
Some pie you can slice?

124
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,799
The soul can be bludgeoned,
tortured, but never broken.

125
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:06,467
Not even by me.

126
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:07,718
Well, there's got to be
<i>something.</i>

127
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:08,969
Maybe.

128
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:11,672
Can't erase Sam's hell,

129
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,374
but I can...

130
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:16,677
Put it behind a wall, if you will.

131
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:17,928
A "wall".

132
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:21,048
In his mind...
a dam to hold back the tide.

133
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:24,018
Nasty, those memories.

134
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,020
You don't want to know
what they'll do to him.

135
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,321
Believe me.

136
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:32,193
Okay, uh, a wall.
Sounds good.

137
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,745
But it's not permanent.

138
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,164
She's right.
Nothing lasts forever.

139
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:39,583
Well, <i>I</i> do, but...

140
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:42,736
Okay, so that's the choice...

141
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:45,206
Sam with no soul,
or Sam with some drywall

142
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,458
that if or when it collapses,

143
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,343
he's... done?

144
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,678
- Yes.
- Do it.

145
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:56,801
I never said I'd do it.

146
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:58,252
Well, then what the hell
have we been talking about?

147
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,253
Your prize.

148
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,689
<i>If</i> you win the wager.

149
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:06,093
Great.
What's the bet?

150
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,431
Don't roll your eyes, Dean.
It's impolite.

151
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,904
Now, when you fetch my ring,
put it on.

152
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,272
What?

153
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:22,493
I want <i>you</i> to be <i>me</i>
<i>for one day.</i>

154
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,128
Are you serious?

155
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,414
No, I'm being
incredibly sarcastic.

156
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,083
Eva, adrenaline!

157
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,141
Take the ring off
before the 24 hours are up,

158
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,259
and you lose.

159
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:42,295
No soul for Sam.
Clear?

160
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:44,265
Okay. Yes.

161
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,233
But... but why?

162
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:48,185
Simple, Dean.
Because...

163
00:08:49,604 --> 00:08:50,971
Oh, thank Moses.

164
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:53,774
You couldn't have given me
five more seconds?

165
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,443
Son, you were gone
for seven minutes.

166
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,479
I was?

167
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:00,781
Mm-hmm.

168
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,284
I thought for sure
Death had you by the twins.

169
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,955
- You what?!
- Just hear me out.

170
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,757
I heard Cass <i>and</i> Crowley
when they said

171
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:11,509
it would either kill me
or turn me to jello, Dean!

172
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,910
I heard enough!

173
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:14,845
- Death said he can put up a wall.
- A wall?

174
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:16,680
Yes, yes, a wall...
that... that, basically,

175
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:17,748
- you wouldn't remember Hell.
- Really?

176
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:18,899
<i>Really.</i>

177
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:20,718
For good?
Like a cure?

178
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:23,687
No, it's not a cure.
It...

179
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,689
He said it could last a lifetime.

180
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,024
Great.

181
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,842
So, playing pretty fast
and loose with my life here,

182
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:30,778
- don't you think, Dean?
- I'm trying to <i>save your life!</i>

183
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:32,563
Exactly, Dean!
It's <i>my</i> life!

184
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:33,981
It's <i>my</i> life,
it's <i>my</i> soul.

185
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,534
And it sure as hell ain't
your head that's gonna explode

186
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,569
when this whole scheme of yours
goes sideways!

187
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,622
Just curious.

188
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,460
I presume Death's not doing this

189
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,712
out of the goodness of his heart.

190
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,548
So what's your half of the deal?

191
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:56,136
I'm sorry. I didn't get that.

192
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:57,555
I have to wear the ring
for a day.

193
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,923
Why the hell
would he want you to do that?

194
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:02,091
Get his rocks off. I don't know.
But I'm doing it.

195
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,564
Where you going?

196
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,983
Look, I hear you, all right?
I get it.

197
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,835
I just need a minute to wrap
my head around it, all right?

198
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:27,785
Looking for this?

199
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:31,789
Just taking a walk.

200
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:33,791
Sam.

201
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,928
I'm your brother.

202
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,347
I'm not gonna let you get hurt.

203
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:42,516
- I know what I'm doing here.
- What if you're wrong?

204
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,184
I won't let it <i>go</i> wrong.

205
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,223
Fine.

206
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,425
Fine? So, you're...

207
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:53,694
So, I'm trusting you here.

208
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:54,728
Barely.

209
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:55,896
You sure?

210
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,564
You're the one
with the compass, right?

211
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,882
Just don't mess it up.

212
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:07,908
I won't.

213
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:09,326
Watch him.

214
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:19,753
So, is this the part
where you pull a gun on me

215
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:21,288
and lock me in the panic room?

216
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:23,323
Do I have to?

217
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,794
No.

218
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:29,263
I guess Dean's got to do
what he's got to do.

219
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:32,766
Guess we all do, kid.

220
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:42,609
Well, here goes everything.

221
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:51,452
Wow.

222
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,253
They'll just let any slack-jawed
haircut be Death these days.

223
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:56,040
Well, you're all charm today,
aren't you?

224
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:58,575
Let's be clear
so that we get through this

225
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,294
with a minimum of screw-up.

226
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:01,578
I don't like this.

227
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,882
And right now,
I'm not crazy about you, either.

228
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,033
This is your boss' idea, not mine.

229
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:08,302
True.

230
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:09,803
But you have a long history

231
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:11,538
of throwing a wrench
in everything,

232
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,039
so let's just stick to the rules.

233
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:14,258
- Deal?
- And the rules are?

234
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:16,093
For the next 24 hours,

235
00:12:16,177 --> 00:12:19,045
you kill everyone
whose number's up.

236
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:20,731
- Well, how am I supposed to know who to...
- Kill?

237
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:22,149
- Yeah.
- I have a list.

238
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:23,400
- Let me see.
- No.

239
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:26,603
You touch them,
they die, I reap them.

240
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:27,988
Are we clear?

241
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:29,907
Yeah, I guess.

242
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:32,409
Remove the ring, you lose.

243
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:34,778
Slack off, you lose.

244
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:36,730
- Got it?
- Yeah.

245
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:38,064
Don't mess this up.

246
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:40,900
It's not my job
to be your damn babysitter.

247
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:08,479
Sam Winchester.

248
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:16,903
This had better be good.

249
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:24,236
Why here's one for
the list of dumbest things ever.

250
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:26,747
Summon the angel
who wants to kill you.

251
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:27,764
Desperate times.

252
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:30,951
I need your help, Balthazar.

253
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:32,236
Interesting...

254
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,570
Since last time we met,

255
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:36,039
you wanted to... what was it?

256
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:40,461
Oh, yes, yes...
fry my wings "extra crispy".

257
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:41,795
Well, that was
a misunderstanding.

258
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,298
Some misunderstanding!

259
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:45,449
I need some advice.

260
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,401
- Advice?
- Angel advice.

261
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:49,336
Well, then go ask your boyfriend.

262
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,138
Cass can't help me.

263
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,925
I need to know if there's
a spell or a weapon,

264
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:58,479
anything that can keep a soul
out... forever.

265
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,580
Ohh.
What's going on, Sam?

266
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:04,801
It's for me.

267
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:06,770
Well...

268
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,972
The plot thickens.

269
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:14,461
Where's your soul, Sam?

270
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:18,031
Good God, no.
It's not still...

271
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,503
It is.

272
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:24,922
My brother found a way
to put it back in me.

273
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,256
I don't want it.

274
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,824
No, you don't.

275
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:31,011
No, no, 'cause Michael and Lucy
are hate-banging it

276
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,396
as we speak.

277
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:34,631
- Can you help me?
- Oh, yes.

278
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:37,334
The question is, will I?

279
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:38,936
Set your terms.

280
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:42,339
I'll do it for free.

281
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,942
Free?

282
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,143
Why?

283
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:48,345
Well, you seem like
a capable young man.

284
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:50,147
I'd love to have you in my debt.

285
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:53,367
And I have to say, I'm not a fan
of your brother,

286
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:56,236
so screwing him would delight me.

287
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:58,688
Anyway, to business.
The spell, yes.

288
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,992
So, finding the ingredients
should be easy enough,

289
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:04,545
but, uh, there's one
tricky part, however.

290
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:05,746
Okay.

291
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,564
You need to scar your vessel.

292
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:09,199
Meaning what?

293
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,869
Meaning something
that so pollutes it,

294
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:15,072
it renders it uninhabitable.

295
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:17,925
Calls for something very specific.

296
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,042
Great. What?

297
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:20,994
Patricide.

298
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:23,730
My dad's been dead for years.

299
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:27,067
To be clear, um, you need
the blood of your father,

300
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:29,720
but your father
needn't be blood.

301
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,606
Comprende?

302
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:42,366
Just so you know,
when people die,

303
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,585
they might have questions
for you.

304
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:47,254
Well, you know,
not <i>you,</i> but Death.

305
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:50,073
You mean like, "how did
Betty White outlast me?"

306
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:52,576
"What's it all mean?"
Is popular.

307
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:54,244
And am I just
gonna magically know?

308
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:55,512
No.

309
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,080
Then what the hell
am I supposed to say?

310
00:15:57,131 --> 00:15:58,382
Oh, come on,
give me <i>something.</i>

311
00:15:58,433 --> 00:15:59,683
Suck it up.
Comes with the gig.

312
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,251
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

313
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:05,422
They can't hear you.
They can't see you.

314
00:16:05,473 --> 00:16:06,607
Just let this play out.

315
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:07,808
Well, who am I taking?

316
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:08,925
Wait and see.

317
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:10,110
Which one?

318
00:16:10,194 --> 00:16:12,195
You want me to shoot the kid?!
Hurry up!

319
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:14,815
Oh, you think I'm kidding?

320
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:17,150
And don't forget the drawer
under the register.

321
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:19,453
Come on, move it!

322
00:16:19,537 --> 00:16:21,071
Let's go!

323
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:23,373
You <i>idiot.</i>

324
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:43,393
Hello? Tick-tock.

325
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,512
He's in agonizing pain, right?

326
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:47,180
Uh, yes.

327
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:49,733
Give me a minute.

328
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:19,513
Why?

329
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:21,331
Mostly because you're a dick.

330
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,601
Enjoy the ride down, pal.

331
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,503
Trust me... sauna gets hot.

332
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,531
That wasn't so hard.

333
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:45,372
Call me crazy, but this
smells like a heart attack.

334
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:50,327
Lucky guess.

335
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:08,345
Why?

336
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:10,847
You think maybe it was
the extra cheese?

337
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:13,350
Yeah.
It was good, though.

338
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:15,318
- Is that a local place?
- Dean.

339
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,054
Right.
Uh, time to go, man.

340
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:18,989
Sorry.

341
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:24,077
Wait.

342
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:27,230
Will you tell me what it all means?

343
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,423
Everything is dust in the wind.

344
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,843
That's it?!

345
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,344
A Kansas song?!

346
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,629
Sorry. He's new.

347
00:18:56,778 --> 00:18:59,229
Woke up and you were gone.
Where you been?

348
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,431
Just driving around.
No biggie.

349
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:04,977
- Drink?
- Yeah. Sure.

350
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:19,216
After you, boss.

351
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:29,609
That's you when we went
to California.

352
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:30,927
You were 6 then.

353
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:34,064
God. We should burn that.

354
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,649
You were adorable.

355
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:38,602
The dad or the kid?

356
00:19:38,653 --> 00:19:40,386
Kid.

357
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:45,325
Come on.
What is she, 13?

358
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:48,643
- She's 12.
- And that's...?

359
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:51,198
That's your mom...

360
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:54,718
when she was your age.

361
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:56,486
This guy have <i>any</i> other family?

362
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:58,205
No, not really.

363
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:01,824
Oh, I remember that...

364
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:06,546
Well, this is awesome.

365
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,632
What, you thought it was all
gonna be armed robbers

366
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:10,217
and heart attacks
waiting to happen?

367
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:12,752
- She's 12!
- With a serious heart condition.

368
00:20:15,306 --> 00:20:16,890
Who's next on the list?

369
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:19,276
Dean, you have to take her.

370
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,694
- Says who?
- Death.

371
00:20:20,778 --> 00:20:22,145
- <i>I'm</i> Death.
- You know what I mean.

372
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:23,280
Well, who tells him?

373
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,564
I don't know.
It just is.

374
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:25,732
It's destiny.

375
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:27,617
Give me a break.

376
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,903
I've spent my whole life
fighting that crap.

377
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:31,955
There's no such thing
as destiny,

378
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,190
just like there was
no apocalypse...

379
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:36,025
just a bunch of stuck-up mooks

380
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:38,211
who didn't want us human slaves
asking questions.

381
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:40,530
Well, <i>I</i> say
the little girl lives.

382
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:42,249
Do you know what's amazing?

383
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,033
You don't actually
buy a word you're saying.

384
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,087
- Yes, I do.
- Oh, really?

385
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:49,339
So, all the times that you
messed with life and death,

386
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,974
they just worked out for you?

387
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,894
It was just a beach party
every time, huh?

388
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:56,179
Well, I know this much...

389
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,332
I'm Death, she's 12,

390
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,234
and she's not dying today.

391
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,234
Yeah. Everything's going to be fine.

392
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:43,310
Medically, I can't explain it.

393
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:46,029
So
her heart just healed?

394
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,948
Couple of times in your career,

395
00:21:48,032 --> 00:21:50,734
you see something you
just got to call a miracle.

396
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:53,737
All I know is
I won't have to operate.

397
00:21:53,788 --> 00:21:55,655
Thank you.
Thank you, doctor.

398
00:21:57,074 --> 00:21:58,942
You did it.
You're gonna be okay.

399
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:07,667
Hey, hon, guess what?
I'm leaving.

400
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:09,920
No, surgery was canceled.

401
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:12,088
Come on.
We have more work here.

402
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:14,724
Okay. See you soon.

403
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,343
Pair of aces.

404
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:20,627
- Want another one?
- Yeah, sure.

405
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:33,907
May have been born at night, boy,
but it wasn't last night.

406
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:42,552
Not good.

407
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:54,527
Let's not do anything hasty
here, Sam.

408
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:30,863
Don't say, "here's Johnny."

409
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:32,948
I got to do this, Bobby.
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:35,034
You shouldn't have
cornered yourself.

411
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:37,102
I didn't!

412
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:06,396
Reinforced steel core,

413
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,567
titanium kick plate.

414
00:24:08,635 --> 00:24:10,986
Get comfy.

415
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:13,355
You want to explain
what this is about?

416
00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:15,941
I just, uh...

417
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:19,311
I have to do this, Bobby.

418
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:20,479
Says who?

419
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,238
If Dean shoves
that soul back in me,

420
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:31,040
think how bad
that could really be.

421
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:33,459
I can't let it happen, Bobby.

422
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,494
I mean, it's not like
I want to kill you.

423
00:24:35,545 --> 00:24:37,213
You've been
nothing but good to me.

424
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,582
So... what,

425
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:41,550
demon deal or something?

426
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:43,519
Spell.

427
00:24:43,603 --> 00:24:45,304
You're making a mistake, Sam.

428
00:24:45,355 --> 00:24:46,705
I'm trying to survive.

429
00:24:46,773 --> 00:24:48,841
Dean's got a way
to make it safe.

430
00:24:48,892 --> 00:24:51,143
Oh, yeah, what,
some wall inside my head

431
00:24:51,194 --> 00:24:52,278
that <i>maybe</i> stays up?

432
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:53,395
Come on.

433
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,346
If it works...

434
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:56,065
Yeah, what if it doesn't?

435
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:57,683
Dean doesn't care about me.

436
00:24:57,751 --> 00:25:00,503
He... he just cares about
his little brother, Sammy,

437
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,687
burning in Hell.

438
00:25:01,738 --> 00:25:03,622
He'll kill me
to get that other guy back.

439
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,524
Look, I...

440
00:25:05,592 --> 00:25:07,893
I know how scary it is.

441
00:25:07,961 --> 00:25:10,863
But you know what's scarier?

442
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:12,515
You right now.

443
00:25:12,582 --> 00:25:15,417
You're not
in your right head, Sam.

444
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:18,270
You're not giving us
much choice here.

445
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:23,626
Sam?

446
00:25:25,512 --> 00:25:26,929
Balls!

447
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:36,772
Ain't nobody killing me
in my house but me.

448
00:25:56,843 --> 00:25:59,678
I don't want to blow your legs out,
boy, but I will.

449
00:26:23,486 --> 00:26:25,955
Oh, what, you gonna give me
the silent treatment now?

450
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,707
Really?

451
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:30,492
Damn it! I knew it!

452
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:31,944
What?

453
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:33,796
<i>Code 500, E.R. code 500, E.R.</i>

454
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,280
What's going on?

455
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,949
Fractured spine,
internal bleeding.

456
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,634
Had a heart attack
in the ambulance.

457
00:26:38,718 --> 00:26:40,135
- We need Dr. Owens.
- He just left.

458
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,470
Call Owens.
Tell him to turn around.

459
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,470
- B.P?
- B.P. 60 over 30.

460
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,470
Pupils fixed and dilated.

461
00:26:48,762 --> 00:26:50,346
- Wait, that's...
- You let the girl live.

462
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,897
The nurse goes home early,

463
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:53,349
gets in a crash
she wouldn't have.

464
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,351
And she needs
the heart surgeon,

465
00:26:55,435 --> 00:26:56,986
and where is he?

466
00:26:58,271 --> 00:26:59,688
You knew this would happen?

467
00:26:59,773 --> 00:27:00,990
No.

468
00:27:01,074 --> 00:27:02,474
Just knew that you
knocked over a domino.

469
00:27:04,811 --> 00:27:05,778
She's in cardiac arrest.

470
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:07,496
- Take her.
- What?

471
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,614
Clear!

472
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:10,115
She's not on the list!

473
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,001
Everything you do
has consequences.

474
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:14,203
Do you want to set off
another chain reaction?

475
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:15,337
She's got nothing to do with this!

476
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:16,755
Well, too bad, Dean.

477
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:19,208
You put on the ring.
Now do your damn job.

478
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:21,660
- Clear!
- Go!

479
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:23,962
Fine.

480
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,669
She's crashing again.
We're losing her.

481
00:27:32,022 --> 00:27:33,639
Clear!

482
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:37,109
Is that...

483
00:27:37,176 --> 00:27:39,228
- Am I...?
- Yes.

484
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:41,513
I'm sorry.

485
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:45,732
- But I'm...
- So young.

486
00:27:45,752 --> 00:27:47,369
Yeah.

487
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:49,371
Actually, you were supposed
to live for many decades.

488
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:52,207
Have kids, grandkids.

489
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:56,412
Then why?

490
00:27:56,496 --> 00:27:58,697
Because he screwed up.

491
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:02,084
You did this to me?

492
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:07,556
Come on, Jolene.
It's time.

493
00:28:10,093 --> 00:28:11,560
Wait.

494
00:28:13,646 --> 00:28:14,596
I'm sorry.

495
00:28:25,492 --> 00:28:28,160
Where is she?
Where's my wife?

496
00:28:28,227 --> 00:28:29,528
Where is she?

497
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:33,032
Scott, wait!

498
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,576
No!

499
00:28:44,094 --> 00:28:45,844
No!

500
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:50,432
A real vacation?

501
00:28:50,517 --> 00:28:51,583
Yeah.

502
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:53,385
I can take you
to this one caf?,

503
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:55,187
show you where I met your mom.

504
00:28:55,254 --> 00:28:57,589
You saw what happened
to the nurse.

505
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,725
Go and kill that girl, Dean.

506
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,103
I tried to tell you
what you already know.

507
00:29:11,154 --> 00:29:13,889
She's disrupting
the natural order

508
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:15,974
by being alive.

509
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:18,110
You of all people
know what that means.

510
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:21,163
Chaos and sadness will follow
her for the rest of her life.

511
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:22,948
We tried it your way.

512
00:29:29,305 --> 00:29:31,457
Give me a minute.

513
00:29:31,524 --> 00:29:32,408
What?

514
00:30:19,522 --> 00:30:20,973
Come on, man,
pull the car over.

515
00:30:21,024 --> 00:30:22,524
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

516
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:25,394
What are you doing?
Pull the damn car over!

517
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:27,312
Stop the car.

518
00:30:27,363 --> 00:30:29,648
Come on, stop the car.

519
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:30,983
- Route 10 is still shut down...
- What are you doing?! Stop the car!

520
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:33,035
From an earlier fatal crash.

521
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,488
- <i>All traffic has to exit...</>
- Son of a bitch!

522
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:37,789
- Aah!
- Hit the brakes!

523
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:39,708
Aah!

524
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,431
Damn it.

525
00:31:29,474 --> 00:31:30,891
Tessa!

526
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,728
You there?! Tessa?!

527
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:36,647
I lost!

528
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:38,315
Sam's screwed!

529
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,633
You happy?!

530
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:43,320
Least you can do
is zap my ass back home!

531
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,358
Hello?!

532
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:09,580
I lost the bet.

533
00:32:09,648 --> 00:32:11,832
Sorry about your brother.

534
00:32:17,806 --> 00:32:19,840
Let's just go.

535
00:32:19,891 --> 00:32:21,074
Go where, Dean?
We're done.

536
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:23,804
What are we...

537
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:26,030
Unfinished business.

538
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:30,701
It's over.

539
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:32,286
You took the ring off.

540
00:32:32,353 --> 00:32:34,521
Anyway, I thought you wanted
the girl to skate by.

541
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:36,574
No one really skates by.

542
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:39,043
Do they?

543
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:59,847
You should
say your goodbyes, man.

544
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:06,287
Hey, honey.

545
00:33:06,354 --> 00:33:08,189
I must have dozed off.

546
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:14,328
Hilary?

547
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:16,196
Somebody!

548
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,421
I'm dead?

549
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:26,240
I'm sorry.

550
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:28,843
- But what about my dad?
- He'll be fine.

551
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,960
- Really?
- I have no idea.

552
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,381
I... I can't just leave him.

553
00:33:34,432 --> 00:33:36,634
- It's not fair!
- I know.

554
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:38,435
Well, then why?

555
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,888
Because...

556
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:46,610
there's sort of a...
a natural order to things.

557
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:49,446
Natural order is stupid.

558
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:51,615
Well, I agree with you there.

559
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:15,506
Listen to me.

560
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,974
You don't want to do this.

561
00:34:19,294 --> 00:34:20,811
Sam.

562
00:34:24,516 --> 00:34:26,650
I've been like a father
to you, boy.

563
00:34:26,735 --> 00:34:29,186
Somewhere inside,
you've got to know that.

564
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:32,523
Well, that's just it.

565
00:34:34,993 --> 00:34:35,993
Sorry.

566
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:43,334
Hi, Sam. I'm back.

567
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,746
I can't keep doing this, Bobby.

568
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:00,309
I mean, what am I,

569
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:03,211
gonna tie him up every time
he tries to kill someone?

570
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:04,930
And that's not gonna hold him.
I mean, he's...

571
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:07,931
Capable of anything.

572
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:17,776
What am I supposed to do here?

573
00:35:20,497 --> 00:35:21,614
I don't know.

574
00:35:54,214 --> 00:35:55,898
Dean.

575
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:57,866
Join me.

576
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,409
Brought you one...

577
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,128
from a little stand
in Los Angeles

578
00:36:09,212 --> 00:36:11,463
known for their bacon dogs.

579
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,583
Sit.

580
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:25,361
Boy, what's with you
and cheap food?

581
00:36:25,428 --> 00:36:27,763
I could ask you the same thing.

582
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:32,434
Thought I'd have a treat
before I put the ring back on.

583
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:36,405
Heavier than it looks, isn't it?

584
00:36:38,224 --> 00:36:41,710
Sometimes, you just
want the thing off.

585
00:36:41,778 --> 00:36:43,329
But you know that.

586
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,167
Not hungry?

587
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:50,052
Look...

588
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,122
I think you know that I flunked.

589
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:54,873
So there.

590
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:57,626
Oh, and by the way, I, uh...

591
00:36:57,677 --> 00:36:59,795
I sucked at being you.

592
00:36:59,846 --> 00:37:02,664
Really screwed up
the whole natural order thing.

593
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:05,551
But I'm sure you knew
about that, too.

594
00:37:05,635 --> 00:37:09,888
So, if you could go back,

595
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:13,175
would you simply kill
the little girl?

596
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:15,394
No fuss, no stomping your feet?

597
00:37:15,478 --> 00:37:17,730
Knowing what I know now, yeah.

598
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:21,233
I'm surprised to hear that.

599
00:37:21,317 --> 00:37:25,486
- Surprised and glad.
- Yeah, well, don't get excited.

600
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:27,106
I would have
saved the nurse, okay?

601
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:28,323
That's it.

602
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:31,193
I think it's a
little more than that.

603
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:35,064
Today, you got a hard look
behind the curtain.

604
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:40,052
Wrecking the natural order's
not quite such fun

605
00:37:40,136 --> 00:37:42,805
when you have to
mop up the mess, is it?

606
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:46,208
This is hard for you, Dean.

607
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:49,712
You throw away your life
because you've come to assume

608
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:52,380
that it'll bounce right back
into your lap.

609
00:37:52,432 --> 00:37:57,753
But the human soul
is not a rubber ball.

610
00:37:57,821 --> 00:38:00,856
It's vulnerable, impermanent,

611
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:03,225
but stronger than you know.

612
00:38:03,276 --> 00:38:06,779
And more valuable
than you can imagine.

613
00:38:10,784 --> 00:38:13,368
So...

614
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,206
I think
you've learned something today.

615
00:38:17,257 --> 00:38:19,942
Want to know what I think?

616
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:25,047
I think you knew
that I wouldn't last a day.

617
00:38:25,098 --> 00:38:28,050
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

618
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:30,018
I lost. Fine.

619
00:38:30,086 --> 00:38:31,887
But at least
I have the balls to admit

620
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:33,338
that it was rigged from the jump.

621
00:38:37,143 --> 00:38:40,145
Most people speak to me
with more respect.

622
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,197
I didn't mean...

623
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:43,198
We're done here.

624
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:45,767
It's been lovely.

625
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:48,537
But now
I'm going to go to Hell

626
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:51,290
to get your brother's soul.

627
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:54,609
Why would you
do that for me?

628
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:57,162
I wouldn't do it for <i>you.</i>

629
00:38:57,247 --> 00:39:00,332
<i>You</i> and your brother
keep coming back.

630
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:03,752
You're an affront
to the balance of the universe,

631
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:06,488
and you cause disruption
on a global scale.

632
00:39:06,556 --> 00:39:08,623
I apologize for that.

633
00:39:08,675 --> 00:39:10,225
But you have use.

634
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:12,978
Right now,
you're digging at something.

635
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,015
The intrepid Detective.

636
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,467
I want you
to keep digging, Dean.

637
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:21,153
So you're just
gonna be cryptic, or...

638
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:22,838
It's about the souls.

639
00:39:25,074 --> 00:39:28,277
You'll understand
when you need to.

640
00:39:28,328 --> 00:39:30,212
Wait...

641
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,447
with Sam...

642
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:33,916
Is this wall thing
really gonna work?

643
00:39:33,983 --> 00:39:35,868
Call it 75%.

644
00:39:40,373 --> 00:39:41,423
Bobby!

645
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,841
Stay away from me!

646
00:39:42,926 --> 00:39:44,209
Open the door.

647
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:45,627
- What happened?
- Now!

648
00:39:45,678 --> 00:39:49,497
Get the hell away from me.

649
00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:51,300
Get away from me!

650
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,888
Don't.

651
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:57,855
Don't!

652
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:05,063
Now, Sam,

653
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:08,534
I'm gonna put up a barrier
inside your mind.

654
00:40:08,618 --> 00:40:09,684
No, don't touch me.

655
00:40:09,736 --> 00:40:12,854
It might feel a little... itchy.

656
00:40:12,906 --> 00:40:14,706
But do me a favor...

657
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:17,709
don't scratch the wall.

658
00:40:20,997 --> 00:40:23,031
Because trust me...

659
00:40:23,082 --> 00:40:25,551
you're not gonna like
what happens.

660
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:27,002
Please.

661
00:40:27,053 --> 00:40:28,420
Don't do this.

662
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:41,083
No, no!
You don't know!

663
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,401
You don't know
what'll happen to me!

664
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:45,571
Dean.
Please!

665
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:48,902
No. No.

666
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,909
Aah!
