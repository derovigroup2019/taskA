and all the elves.

543
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,655

Brennan made a deal

544
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,490

545
00:27:54,575 --> 00:27:56,309

# oh, oh, oh #
So, Mr. Brennan.

549
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:06,836
Hello again.

550
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,155
Leave me alone.

551
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:12,258
Did I ever mention
how beautiful your work is?

552
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:14,877
What?

553
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:16,879
The watches...
just stunning.

554
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:18,798
But what I can't figure out

555
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:21,601
is how one man can put out
that much product.

556
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:24,354
I mean, hell,
if I didn't know better,

557
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:27,523
I'd say you have a bunch
of elves working for ya.

558
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:33,980
Except I <i>do</i> know better.

559
00:28:34,031 --> 00:28:36,783
And you have a bunch of elves
working for you.

560
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,518
You're insane.

561
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,989
So, tell me... how does a father
decide to trade his son

562
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,440
for a bunch of watches?

563
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,211
I mean, I'm assuming
you have a soul,

564
00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:50,046
so what's your excuse?

565
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:55,251
You don't understand.

566
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:57,053
It wasn't like that.

00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:00,640
Then how was it?

569
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,910
I supported my family for
30 years making those watches.

570
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:42,849
It's the only thing
I know how to do.

571
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,750
But the Parkinson's...

572
00:29:44,802 --> 00:29:47,019
I was losing my hands.

573
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,322
I was losing <i>everything.</i>

574
00:29:50,774 --> 00:29:54,527
My grandmother, she always
used to say that they were real,

575
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:57,397
told me all these stories
when I was a kid

576
00:29:57,448 --> 00:30:00,283
about how to summon them.

577

How to get favors from them.

578
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,153
So you learned
how to work a spell.

579
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:07,039
I mean...

580
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:09,742
Honestly, I doubted
it would even work.

581
00:30:09,793 --> 00:30:12,111
[Scoffs]
I was just desperate.

582
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:14,063
She left me this book.

583
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:17,450
So I did the ceremony
in my back office

584
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:19,135
two months ago.

585
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:21,053
[Inhales deeply]

586
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:25,007
And this... man appeared.

587
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:27,226
Said he was a Leprechaun.

588
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:29,262
A Leprechaun?

589
00:30:30,647 --> 00:30:33,399
I asked him just
to cure my hands,

590
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:36,235
but he said he would
do even better.

591
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:39,805
He'd make me more successful
than I'd ever been.

592
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:41,908
He told me he'd bring
a crew of workers,

593
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:46,279
that I could save my business,
save my name.

594
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,680
In exchange for...?

595
00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:50,249
He just wanted a place
for them to rest,

596
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:52,985
"to take of the fruit
and fat of the land".

597
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:54,704
I...

598
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:55,838
I said yes.

599
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:58,341
I... I wasn't thinking.

600
00:30:58,425 --> 00:31:00,610
And the "fruit and the fat" was...

601
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:04,897
My first-born.

602
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:07,550
But not just mine.

603
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:08,768
There's been others.

604

They're not <i>going</i> to stop.

606
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:15,107
There's got to be a way
to reverse the spell.

607
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:16,209
There is.

608
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:18,110
But the book is...

609
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:20,897
it's in the safe in my shop.

610
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:23,566
They won't let me near it.

611
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,536
It's been a nightmare.

612
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,404

exactly what kind of hate crime
this even was.

639
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:37,582
It wasn't a hate crime.

[Laughing] Oh, please.

718
00:37:31,117 --> 00:37:33,601
I'm talking about
real magic, Sonny,

719
00:37:33,653 --> 00:37:36,404
from my side of the fence.

720
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:39,074
Got a way of gettin' in back doors.

721
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:42,761
So you're my blue fairy?

722
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:45,714
You can make me
a real boy again?

723
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:49,551
When you wish upon a star.

724
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,921
Yeah.

725
00:37:52,972 --> 00:37:55,557
I got a wish.

726
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,225
Aah!

727
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:58,960
Iron.

728
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:01,429
Painful...

729
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,798
but not a deal breaker.

730
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:24,085
[Footsteps approach]

731
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,041

[Grunts]

735
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:05,376
Come on, lad.

736
00:39:05,461 --> 00:39:08,246
You've already taken
your best shot.

737
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,965
[Breathing heavily]

738
00:39:11,033 --> 00:39:12,834
You're right.

739
00:39:12,885 --> 00:39:14,085
[Gun clatters]

740
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,754
I'm done shooting.

741
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,340
So do me a favor...

742
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:20,975
and count this.

743
00:39:21,043 --> 00:39:22,644
[Salt rattles]

744
00:39:22,711 --> 00:39:25,013
Oh, no.

745
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:26,547
[Cane thumps]

746
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,432
[Cartridge clatters]

747
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:30,685
[Breathless]
Why didn't I do that earlier?

748
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:36,775
1...

749
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:38,193
- <i>Cum sabhailt...</i>
- <i>3...</i>

750
00:39:38,244 --> 00:39:40,528
- <i>Ar naoidhein...</i>
- <i>You ass!</i>

751
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:42,447
- <i>Gun am breith.</i>

[Trunk slams]

756
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,539
So...
[Exhales sharply]

757
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,257
Here's to the tiniest D.A.

758
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:24,176
Thanks for dropping the charges.

759
00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:28,497
Little big man.

760
00:40:32,402 --> 00:40:34,720
I was wondering something.

761
00:40:34,787 --> 00:40:36,071
Yeah?

762
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:39,575
You think lucky charms
really could have, you know,

763
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:41,360
returned soul to sender?

764
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:42,778
[Scoffs]
Come on.

765
00:40:42,862 --> 00:40:44,396
It's crazy to think.

766
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:46,665
He did talk a good game, though.

767
00:40:46,732 --> 00:40:48,200
Hmm.

768
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,618
You said no.

769
00:40:49,702 --> 00:40:51,453
Why?

770
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,574
It was a deal.

771
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:58,342
When's a deal
<i>ever</i> been a good thing?

772
00:41:00,746 --> 00:41:02,548
I'm just trying to figure out
how it works in there.

773
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,883
[Scoffs]

774
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:07,886
Dude, I... I do still have
all my brain cells.

775
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:10,255
If anything, my brain
works <i>better</i> now.

776
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:13,475
I'm just making sure
that's where your head's at.

777
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,611
You know, that you're not
having second thoughts

778
00:41:15,695 --> 00:41:16,979
about getting your soul back.

779
00:41:17,046 --> 00:41:18,697
Oh.

780
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:24,036
You're not, are you?

781
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:27,990
No.
