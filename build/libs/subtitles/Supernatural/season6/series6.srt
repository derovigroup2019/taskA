1
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:03,553
It's Sam, Bobby.

2
00:00:03,647 --> 00:00:04,947
He's just... he's different.

3
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,380
Something's not right to me.

4
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:08,099
I... I can't just lose you and Ben.

5
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:10,684
Me and Ben will be here,
and you come when you can.

6
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:12,520
Just come in one piece.

7
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,605
And you really think we could
pull something like that off?

8
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:15,556
It's worth a shot.

9
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:20,727
What the hell's wrong with you, Sam?

10
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:22,563
You knew about the cure.

11
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,948
- - No I didn't.
- 'Cause if you <i>had</i> known,

12
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:25,950
it'd be almost like you
<i>let</i> him get turned.

13
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:27,918
Just tell me what the hell is going on.

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,425
- Dean?
- Ben, just stay there.

15
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:35,926
- I thought I heard you.
- ...I said stay back!

16
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:40,931
Cure's an old Campbell recipe.

17
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:44,935
Nobody's tried it since God knows.

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,606
From what I hear,
the stuff is a bad trip.

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,307
At least, uh...

20
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:52,526
You got my back.

21
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,278
No matter what happens,
I can always count on you,

22
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:55,780
- right, Sammy?
- Of course, Dean.

23
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,601
<i>I'm Ashley Frank, and I will...</i>

24
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:05,437
He said he'd call,
but of course he never did.

25
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:06,755
But... I don't know.

26
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:09,024
I just... we had such a good time.

27
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:11,443
I... I should call him, right?
Do you think?

28
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:14,480
I mean, should I call him?
I don't know, it's...

29
00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:17,316
Oh. Uh, Olivia, just hold on a sec.

30
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:23,038
I just need the truth. That's all.

31
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,324
I really gotta go, okay?
Call you later.

32
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:29,211
- I pity you.
- I'm sorry?

33
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:31,296
You're sad and pathetic,
and I pity you...

34
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:32,831
only reason I'm giving you
a head's up.

35
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:35,717
Stay away from the clam chowder.

36
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:40,672
I flavored it with my own...
seasoning.

37
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:50,566
Hey, Jane.

38
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:52,184
You know that new girl, Misty?

39
00:01:52,268 --> 00:01:54,518
- Way hotter than you.
- Excuse me?

40
00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:57,990
Basically, she's an eight,
and you're a...

41
00:01:58,074 --> 00:01:59,074
a three.

42
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:07,616
Can I get you anything else, ma'am?

43
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:08,784
No, thank you.

44
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:11,253
I ran over a homeless man once

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,757
and I never even stopped
to see if he was alive.

46
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:27,052
I hate mommy.

47
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:29,271
I want to burn her in her sleep.

48
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:33,058
I don't know what it is,
but you just give me the creeps.

49
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:35,194
Like I get physically nauseous.

50
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:36,612
You're pathetic.

51
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,030
Loser.

52
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:41,349
- Desperate.
- Stupid.

53
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,035
Mousy.

54
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,537
You're a desperate, pathetic loser.

55
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:47,706
You're gonna die alone.

56
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,958
Hey, can you come get me?

57
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:52,544
You sound awful.
Have you been drinking?

58
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,362
I think I'm going crazy.

59
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:55,864
I'm freaking out.

60
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:59,384
Of course you are.
'Cause you <i>are</i> a freak.

61
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:00,969
You're certifiable.

62
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:04,223
Every time the phone rings,
my stomach drops.

63
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:05,841
Jane with another crisis.

64
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:07,559
You're a walking disaster.

65
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:09,678
The whole family's just waiting

66
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,880
for your next big breakdown, Jane.

67
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:13,265
We're like hostages.

68
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,901
Why don't you just go ahead
and kill yourself already?

69
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,825
Season 6 Episode 6
"You Can't Handle the Truth"

70
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:33,624
I know what I saw, Bobby.

71
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:34,842
We tested him.

72
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:37,178
Salt, silver... everything.

73
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:39,163
He threw me to that vamp.

74
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:40,848
I'm telling you,
it's not my brother.

75
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:43,017
Well, then he's something
we ain't ever seen before.

76
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:44,501
Yeah, or it's freakin' Lucifer.

77
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:45,720
Did you call Cass?

78
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:47,504
Of course I called Cass.
He's not answering.

79
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:49,974
Screw him. I can't wait anymore.

80
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:52,009
Look, I get it. You're rattled.

81
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,644
You're right to be,

82
00:03:53,695 --> 00:03:54,729
but let's be professional...

83
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:56,013
Professional?

84
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:57,982
He <i>watched</i> me get turned!

85
00:03:58,033 --> 00:03:59,233
What you saw...

86
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:01,118
are you sure that's what you saw?

87
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:02,870
Damn it, Bobby! Yes, I know.

88
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:05,957
Well, "you know"
ain't the same as proof.

89
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:07,375
'Cause we're talking about...

90
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:08,859
We're talking about doing
something about this, and fast.

91
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:10,328
It's not just the vamp.

92
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,862
He has been different from the jump.

93
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:14,532
All right. I'm with you.

94
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,050
- Are you?
- Yeah.

95
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:17,501
I'll hit the books, hard.

96
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:19,537
Just don't shoot him yet, all right?

97
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:22,473
Watch him. We need facts.

98
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,977
'Cause if it ain't Sam...
we don't know <i>what</i> it is.

99
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:28,429
And if we're gonna put him down,
we need to know how.

100
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:30,681
I don't even want to ride
in the same car with him,

101
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:32,683
much less work a damn case.

102
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:34,602
Get in the car. <i>He's</i> your case.

103
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:42,526
Hey. I was just, uh,
I was leaving Lisa a message.

104
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:44,612
- Still hasn't called you back, huh?
- No.

105
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:45,580
- Sucks.
- Yeah.

106
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:47,665
You okay?

107
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:51,402
Yeah. I'm fine.
How are you?

108
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:53,371
Me? Great.

109
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:55,256
Here, look. Check this out.

110
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,508
Think it might be something.

111
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:59,126
Four people, out of nowhere,

112
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:00,678
all in the last couple of weeks.

113
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:02,679
What do you say?

114
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:06,133
Yeah. Sounds like a plan.

115
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:08,184
Let's go.

116
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,145
I don't understand.

117
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,115
Why would Federal Investigators
be interested in a suicide?

118
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:22,984
Well, um...

119
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:25,953
It's a new, more caring administration.

120
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,908
Well, I already told the cops.

121
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,860
Jane was having a really bad day,

122
00:05:32,928 --> 00:05:36,613
so I... I did what
any sister would do.

123
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:42,837
I... tried to cheer her up, you know?

124
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:45,673
Told her to hang in there.

125
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,177
You know what a "tell" is?

126
00:05:52,064 --> 00:05:53,130
Excuse me?

127
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:54,798
It's a poker term...

128
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,800
for when you're bluffing.

129
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:58,969
Like what you just
did with your hair.

130
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:00,521
What are you trying to say?

131
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:01,973
You're lying.

132
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,190
What?!

133
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:06,577
Tell us what you
did to your sister.

134
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:18,673
Okay. You're right.

135
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:20,391
I was lying.

136
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:22,826
I wanted to tell her, "I love you".

137
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,413
"I'm here for you."

138
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,165
Oh, but what came out was...

139
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:31,218
"you're a burden.
Just kill yourself."

140
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:33,721
Who says that?!

141
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:36,190
I... I... I just couldn't stop!

142
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:43,481
See anything in the house?

143
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:45,733
No hex bags,
no sulfur, no EMF. You?

144
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:48,285
A tuba and an issue
of <i>Crochet Today.</i>

145
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:50,187
So, what, already kinda suicidal?

146
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:52,356
Right, and then big sis's
taxicab confession

147
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:53,741
sends her over the edge.

148
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:55,493
Question is, what made big sis

149
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:57,795
open her big, fat mouth
in the first place?

150
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,380
Yeah, that <i>is</i> the question.

151
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:13,210
<i>Are organic fruits and veggies</i>
<i>worth the high cost?</i>

152
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:15,879
Thanks. Uh, can you grab
some gauze, please?

153
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:18,065
Mm-hmm.

154
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,401
Should've had you
prescribe me a Valium.

155
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:22,153
Just relax.

156
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,238
- <i>What is the truth?</i>
- It'll be fine.

157
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:25,856
<i>I'm Ashley Frank.</i>

158
00:07:25,907 --> 00:07:27,691
I got to be honest, Paul...

159
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,943
I don't really want to be here.

160
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:31,061
You and most people,
but you know what?

161
00:07:31,163 --> 00:07:32,580
I don't take it personally.

162
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:34,615
Okay, open up.

163
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:40,921
You and Donna should
come over for supper.

164
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,673
How long has it been?

165
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,792
There. Worst part's over.

166
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,410
I'm not really into Donna anymore.

167
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:47,744
She's old.

168
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,599
Your wife looks great for her age.

169
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:53,768
Her saggy skin makes me want to hurl.

170
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:56,053
I have urges, you know.

171
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:57,754
Okay.

172
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:01,776
Remember that camping trip
I missed 'cause I was sick?

173
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,194
Well, I wasn't.

174
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:05,146
I was just afraid to be around Melissa.

175
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:08,599
My <i>daughter</i> Melissa?

176
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:11,202
But then...

177
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:13,454
she spent the night
for Jill's slumber party.

178
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:15,106
Oh...

179
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:17,658
it just seemed so easy, you know?

180
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:19,443
What are you saying?

181
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,879
It's not so much I
couldn't control myself.

182
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:23,714
I just knew I wouldn't get caught.

183
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:27,168
And I didn't get caught.

184
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:45,095
Hey. You got anything?

185
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:46,836
I've been
up all night lookin'.

186
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,054
Nothing fits.

187
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:50,139
Awesome.

188
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,141
You got anything else to go on?

189
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:54,644
Yeah, my skin crawls being
in the same room with him.

190
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:56,028
Why don't you look <i>that</i> up?

191
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:57,396
I'm working on it.

192
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:59,148
I don't know how much longer
I can do this, Bobby.

193
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,867
You got to figure out
what the hell he is and fast.

194
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:02,318
I'm trying.

195
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:05,404
But, Dean, there's a
worst-case scenario.

196
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:07,457
What, Satan's my
co-pilot? Yeah, I know.

197
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:09,475
Well, that'd be the
<i>other</i> worst case.

198
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:10,626
Well, then what?

199
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:13,412
Maybe it's just Sam.

200
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:16,582
I gotta go.

201
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,835
Dean. You got a day, Bobby,

202
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:21,370
and then I'm handling this.

203
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:47,780
There was another one.

204
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:49,231
Yeah? What?

205
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:52,485
Dentist drilled a guy to death.

206
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:56,405
You mean the... non-sexy kind
of drilling, right?

207
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:58,307
50 bucks says he's mixed up
in all the crazy.

208
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,792
- You think?
- Yeah. Let's go talk to him.

209
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,711
Okay. Uh...

210
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:03,379
Why don't you go ahead? I'll catch up.

211
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,630
I'm gonna do a little research.

212
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:09,251
You sure?

213
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:11,938
Yeah. We got to know
what we're up against, right?

214
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,763
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.

215
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:40,249
Thanks a lot.

216
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:47,456
Anything from marathon man?

217
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:48,958
Not exactly.

218
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,643
He hung himself in his cell
before I could get to him.

219
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:51,761
Yikes.

220
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:53,679
But he was definitely involved.

221
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:55,731
Just got the scoop from his assistant.

222
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,567
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

223
00:10:57,634 --> 00:10:59,635
Let's say the stuff that his
patient was confessing to...

224
00:10:59,686 --> 00:11:00,853
<i>I'd</i> have murdered him, too.

225
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:02,688
So, root canal and Russian roulette...

226
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:05,024
both of 'em, it's like
they were cursed, right?

227
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:06,692
I mean, people are just compelled

228
00:11:06,777 --> 00:11:08,277
to puke the truth all over 'em?

229
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:10,312
Oh, getting hit with
the ugly truth, you go postal?

230
00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:11,497
I'd call that a curse.

231
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:12,748
Do me a favor...

232
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:14,533
I'm going to the morgue
to check out the body.

233
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:17,253
Why don't you take the dentist's
office, see what you see?

234
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,921
Yeah. No problem.

235
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:18,014
Jane and Dr. Conley.

236
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:19,649
I heard. Awful.

237
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:20,983
What do I have to do with it?

238
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:23,936
Honestly? You're the only thing
they have in common.

239
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:27,222
Did they say anything to you
before they, uh...?

240
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:28,557
Sorry. Not really.

241
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:30,026
Right.

242
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:32,695
Ah, I was just fishing.

243
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:34,196
Thanks.

244
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:36,365
Hey, by the way,
how 'bout my horn?

245
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:39,535
Sorry?

246
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:41,170
Stolen horn?

247
00:12:41,237 --> 00:12:43,456
Right. Yeah. We're...
we're working on it.

248
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,240
Well, I hope so.
Thing's one-in-a-billion.

249
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:50,096
What makes it
one-in-a-billion again?

250
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,514
It's a museum piece.

251
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:55,351
And near as anyone can tell,
about a thousand years old.

252
00:12:57,387 --> 00:12:58,637
Where's it from?

253
00:12:58,722 --> 00:12:59,855
No one knows.

254
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:02,208
When did it get swiped?

255
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:04,360
About...

256
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:05,895
two weeks ago,

257
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:08,230
same day Jane died.

258
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:23,245
Castiel? Hello?

259
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:26,966
Possible loose nuke down here.
Angelic weapon.

260
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,919
Kinda your department.

261
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,922
You hear that, Cass?

262
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:34,256
Hello, Dean.

263
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:35,674
Are you kidding me?

264
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,626
I have been on red alert about Sam,

265
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:39,478
and you come for
some stupid <i>horn?!</i>

266
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:41,764
You asked me to
be here, and I came.

267
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:44,583
I... I've been asking you to
be here for days, you dick!

268
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:48,804
I didn't come about Sam

269
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:50,940
because I have
nothing to offer about Sam.

270
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:52,858
Well, that's great,
because for all we know,

271
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:54,309
he's just gift wrap for Lucifer.

272
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:57,329
No, he's...

273
00:13:57,414 --> 00:13:58,914
he's not Lucifer.

274
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:01,150
And how do you know that?

275
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:05,171
If Lucifer escaped the cage,

276
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:06,589
we'd feel it.

277
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,260
What is wrong with him?

278
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:13,863
I don't know, Dean. I'm sorry.

279
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,217
What happened to you, Cass?

280
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:20,836
You used to be human,
or at least like one.

281
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:24,056
I'm at war.

282
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:32,181
Certain...

283
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:34,984
regrettable things are
now required of me.

284
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:40,072
And Gabriel's Horn of Truth?
That's a real thing?

285
00:14:40,157 --> 00:14:42,124
- You've seen it?
- We think it's in town.

286
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:45,211
Something's forcing people...

287
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:47,863
Oh, well, you're welcome!

288
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:53,535
It isn't the Horn of Truth.

289
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:54,970
What are you talking about?

290
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:56,922
You were gone for like two
seconds. Where did you look?

291
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:58,557
Everywhere.

292
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,561
Right.

293
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:03,929
Well, nice seeing you, anyway.

294
00:15:05,682 --> 00:15:06,649
Dean.

295
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:08,717
What?

296
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:10,402
About your brother.

297
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:12,321
I...

298
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:13,823
I don't know what's wrong with him,

299
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,108
but I do want to help.

300
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:18,410
I'll make inquiries.

301
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:30,572
Yeah. Thanks.

302
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:39,265
Now, I'd actually like to see

303
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:41,717
<i>all</i> the suicides
that came in this week,

304
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:43,302
not just Dr. Giggles.

305
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,224
Is that gonna be a problem?

306
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:52,427
Well, they're... they're already gone.

307
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,646
As in transferred?

308
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,414
Yeah, not exactly.

309
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:59,818
Would you like to tell me
what's going on here,

310
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:01,937
or should I have a little chat
with your supervisor?

311
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,441
They're <i>gone.</i>

312
00:16:09,696 --> 00:16:12,748
As in... <i>gone,</i> gone?

313
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:21,456
<i>...Predatory prices.</i>

314
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:22,841
<i>Here's the facts.</i>

315
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:25,344
<i>Tune in weekdays</i>
<i>for the newest addition</i>

316
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:27,730
<i>to our award-winning local team.</i>

317
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:31,517
<i>Find out the truth</i>
<i>about your layaway living room.</i>

318
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:32,601
Another one?

319
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:34,353
Uh, no, thanks. I'm working.

320
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:38,574
Hey, what's up?

321
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,576
All the bodies are gone.

322
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:43,028
What do you mean, they just vanished?

323
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:45,331
That's what the coroner said.
But I got a lead.

324
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:46,699
One of the missing bodies,

325
00:16:46,783 --> 00:16:48,951
She died a whole week
before everybody else.

326
00:16:49,002 --> 00:16:51,120
Suicide?

327
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:52,204
Reported as a car accident,

328
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:53,706
but no reason it couldn't have been.

329
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,624
So then that would make her
our patient zero, right?

330
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,126
I'm thinking maybe.

331
00:16:57,177 --> 00:16:59,795
Whatever got this whole curse
thing rolling started with her.

332
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:02,348
I'm at her place now,
corner of Burnham and 159th.

333
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:04,633
Yeah, give me 10.

334
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:08,000
You know what?
I will have that other one.

335
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:10,689
Thought you were working.

336
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:13,342
I am working up to it.

337
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:16,178
You okay?

338
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:19,448
No, not really.

339
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:22,585
<i>I talked to local experts</i>
<i>to bring you the truth.</i>

340
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:24,954
On me.

341
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:27,372
Anything else I can get you?

342
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:32,044
I'd just like the freakin' truth.

343
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:42,171
But I'll settle for another one.

344
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:44,256
Sometimes I think
I can't get pregnant

345
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:46,258
'cause God knows
my marriage is a sham.

346
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:51,545
Why'd I say that?

347
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:56,185
I mean, I've been
snorting oxy all day.

348
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:58,369
Why'd I say <i>that?</i>

349
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:06,845
I'm pretty sure I know.

350
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:17,999
I've got to go.
Thank you.

351
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:23,257
I'm sitting like this
so you'll look at my breasts.

352
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:26,627
I just bought them.
I need a <i>lot</i> of attention.

353
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:30,931
Good luck with that.

354
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:45,429
Hey, anything you're
itchin' to tell me?

355
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:48,598
Not really.

356
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,017
Sorry to disappoint.

357
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:51,485
Ah, that's all right.

358
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,103
I'm just testing a theory.

359
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:54,988
Well, I'm here hittin' the books

360
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:57,074
while drinking a nice glass of milk

361
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:58,792
and watching "Tori & Dean."

362
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:01,628
Wh... wait, w... who and Dean?

363
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:03,046
Tori Spelling.

364
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:04,881
I'm a huge fan.

365
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,583
Girl's a real talent.

366
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:10,253
Oh, I guess it does
work over the phone.

367
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:11,805
You know what else?

368
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:13,790
I get a pedicure once in a while...

369
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:15,592
this nice Vietnamese joint.

370
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:16,810
Okay. Okay, please stop.

371
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:18,729
This one gal, Nhung Phuong...

372
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:20,964
her name means "Velvet Phoenix."

373
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:23,583
Tiny thing, but the grip on her.

374
00:19:23,651 --> 00:19:25,268
She starts on my toes,

375
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,653
and I feel like I am gonna...

376
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:29,489
Whoa, whoa! Hey, come on, m...
Now I'm scarred for life.

377
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:30,691
Thank you.

378
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:32,826
I never told anyone that.

379
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:34,494
Why am I telling <i>you?</i>

380
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,614
Maybe 'cause you're my favorite.

381
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:40,200
Although, Sam's a better hunter.

382
00:19:40,284 --> 00:19:41,651
Lately, anyway.

383
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:44,588
Whoa. Why the hell
<i>am</i> I tellin' you this?!

384
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:45,789
Because I'm cursed.

385
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,174
- Cursed?
- Yes.

386
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:48,491
How is it...

387
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:52,045
That half the time you clean a mess,

388
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,014
you end up dirty?

389
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:56,049
Actually, this might be the best thing
that's happened to me in a while.

390
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:57,768
What do you mean?

391
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:59,886
Dean...

392
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:02,189
Dean, what damn fool move
are you about to...

393
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:03,673
I gotta go.

394
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:05,675
Okay.

395
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:07,894
But did you know my first
girlfriend turned out to be a...

396
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:09,012
No, no.

397
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:11,414
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

398
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,457
<i>It's Sam. Leave me a message.</i>

399
00:20:20,524 --> 00:20:21,658
Sam, it's me.

400
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:23,326
Listen, I'm on my way to you,

401
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:25,979
but if you get this before then,
give me a call back.

402
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:27,998
There's a few things I want to ask you.

403
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:30,751
So, why is there an investigation

404
00:20:30,835 --> 00:20:32,368
for a car accident?

405
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,172
It wasn't an accident.

406
00:20:35,223 --> 00:20:37,057
Corey committed suicide.

407
00:20:39,894 --> 00:20:41,845
You know...

408
00:20:41,896 --> 00:20:43,764
I wondered.

409
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:50,270
I... I'm sorry.

410
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:52,406
I just...

411
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:56,943
So, you had some idea Corey
might have taken her own life?

412
00:20:57,028 --> 00:21:00,063
Well...

413
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:03,917
She had been going through
a bit of a hard time lately...

414
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:06,368
at school. And then,

415
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,122
um, her cat, Mittens,
had just ran away.

416
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:14,577
But, really...

417
00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:16,430
it was her boyfriend.

418
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:20,550
She was sure that
he was cheating on her,

419
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:23,887
but he was just very good
at covering his tracks.

420
00:21:23,938 --> 00:21:26,923
Which, of course, made her
completely obsessed with...

421
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:28,424
Finding out the truth.

422
00:21:28,476 --> 00:21:30,260
Yeah.

423
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:32,112
You mind if I check out her room?

424
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:53,583
Hey.

425
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:56,002
So.... I saw you called.

426
00:21:58,005 --> 00:22:00,590
Yeah, it's been crazy.

427
00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:05,395
Ben won't even talk about it.

428
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:09,566
Lisa, I'm sorry,

429
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:11,852
but this is actually the...

430
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:13,469
worst time in the universe to talk.

431
00:22:13,521 --> 00:22:15,155
Ca... can we do this later?

432
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:17,274
You shoved my kid, Dean.

433
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:18,825
How about we do this now?

434
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,681
It wasn't like that.

435
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:27,200
Then how was it?

436
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:33,006
I can't really explain.

437
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,211
You want to know the truth?

438
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:41,331
Probably not.

439
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:45,335
You've got so much buried in there,

440
00:22:45,386 --> 00:22:48,188
and you push it down,
and you push it down.

441
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:49,723
Do you honestly think

442
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:52,726
that you can go through life
like that and <i>not</i> freak out?

443
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,111
Just, what, drink half a fifth a night

444
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:56,363
and you're good?

445
00:22:56,447 --> 00:22:57,864
You knew what you signed up for.

446
00:22:57,949 --> 00:23:00,901
Yeah, but I didn't
expect Sam to come back.

447
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:03,286
And I'm glad he's okay. I am.

448
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:05,322
But the minute he walked
through that door, I knew

449
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:06,706
it was over.

450
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,526
You two have the most unhealthy,
tangled-up, crazy thing

451
00:23:10,578 --> 00:23:11,795
I've ever seen.

452
00:23:11,862 --> 00:23:13,463
And as long as he's in your life,

453
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,714
you're <i>never gonna be happy.</i>

454
00:23:19,703 --> 00:23:23,206
That came out so
much harsher than I meant.

455
00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:26,142
It's not your fault.

456
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,827
I'm not saying don't be close to Sam.

457
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:30,546
I'm close to my sister.

458
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:32,482
But if she got killed,

459
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:33,984
I wouldn't bring her
back from the dead!

460
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:37,103
Okay, Lis...

461
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:39,222
I'm not gonna lie.

462
00:23:39,273 --> 00:23:41,241
Okay, me and Sam, we...

463
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:42,776
we've got issues.

464
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,578
No doubt.

465
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:46,329
But you and Ben...

466
00:23:46,397 --> 00:23:48,914
Me and Ben can't
be in this with you.

467
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,618
I'm sorry.

468
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:30,440
Sorry, Mittens.

469
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:33,243
Hey, where you been? I found something.

470
00:24:33,294 --> 00:24:35,295
It can wait. We got to talk.

471
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:36,963
Yeah. What's up?

472
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:39,582
There's a few things I want to ask you,

473
00:24:39,634 --> 00:24:42,285
and, uh, you're
gonna tell me the truth.

474
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:44,137
Uh, yeah, Dean. Of course.

475
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,889
What are you talking about?

476
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:48,341
Whoa. Are you saying <i>you're...</i>

477
00:24:48,426 --> 00:24:50,126
I asked for the truth.

478
00:24:50,177 --> 00:24:52,646
And you know what? I'm getting it.

479
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:55,682
So, like I said,
I have a few questions for you.

480
00:24:57,852 --> 00:24:59,686
When that vamp attacked me,

481
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,655
why did you just stand there?

482
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:11,581
I... I didn't.

483
00:25:16,037 --> 00:25:18,088
I froze.

484
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:20,707
You froze.

485
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:23,543
You have been Terminator
since you got back.

486
00:25:23,627 --> 00:25:25,779
I don't know. Shock?

487
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:31,217
And then it was too late.

488
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:36,606
I feel terrible about it.

489
00:25:36,673 --> 00:25:37,857
Believe me.

490
00:25:37,942 --> 00:25:40,026
Dean...

491
00:25:40,111 --> 00:25:43,263
I can't lie here.

492
00:25:44,815 --> 00:25:46,182
Do you really think

493
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:47,650
I would let something like that
happen on <i>purpose?</i>

494
00:25:48,953 --> 00:25:50,686
You're my <i>brother.</i>
<i>H... how could you even...</i>

495
00:25:50,738 --> 00:25:52,454
Okay.

496
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,463
Okay.

497
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:03,049
Sorry.

498
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:04,968
I... I thought...
I thought I saw something.

499
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:05,919
I...

500
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:09,889
I guess I was wrong.

501
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:14,894
It's just been a
really, really bad day.

502
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:17,430
Hey. It's okay.

503
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:22,402
I got your back, all right?

504
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:23,603
I always have.

505
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:27,073
Thanks, Sammy.

506
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:37,723
So this was the chicks pet?

507
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:40,355
<i>Well, she was obsessed.</i>

508
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,140
I think you mean crazy.

509
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:44,159
All right, so cat skull,

510
00:26:44,243 --> 00:26:47,863
uh, grains-of-paradise seed,
devil's shoestring.

511
00:26:47,947 --> 00:26:49,498
Mix 'em well, you got yourself
a summoning spell.

512
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:52,484
Demon?

513
00:26:52,535 --> 00:26:54,002
God.

514
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:55,671
Corey was so desperate for the truth

515
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:57,655
about her boyfriend's cheating heart,

516
00:26:57,707 --> 00:26:58,990
she went digging around.

517
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,342
Nothing panned out,

518
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:02,127
so she went looking
for a different kind of help.

519
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:04,546
- Opened a door she couldn't close.
- Yeah.

520
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,549
Now anyone in town
who asks aloud for the truth

521
00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:08,684
invokes Veritas.

522
00:27:08,768 --> 00:27:10,352
And she doesn't
just give it to you,

523
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:12,270
she slams you with it
until you kill yourself.

524
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:13,805
And she gets her tribute.

525
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:16,725
So, all that "tribute"
vanishing from the morgue.

526
00:27:16,793 --> 00:27:19,528
What do you think, uh,
Soylent-Green situation?

527
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:22,814
Gods got to eat, too.

528
00:27:22,865 --> 00:27:26,368
Which means we got to take her
out or <i>you're</i> on the menu.

529
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:28,120
All right, well, what do we know,

530
00:27:28,187 --> 00:27:29,504
besides crazy cat lady?

531
00:27:29,572 --> 00:27:32,257
- Well, dogs are her Achilles heel.
- Naturally.

532
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:34,242
And she was a pretty hands-on
goddess back in the day.

533
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:36,328
Her thing was coming
down from the mountain

534
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:37,896
to speak truth to the masses.

535
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:40,499
She wanted more than tribute.
She wanted to be worshipped.

536
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:41,917
An attention whore.

537
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:44,136
If you want to put it that way.

538
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:46,871
And what is the 21st-century version

539
00:27:46,923 --> 00:27:49,141
of speaking truth to the masses?

540
00:27:55,314 --> 00:27:57,599
So you really think
this God is slumming

541
00:27:57,683 --> 00:27:59,551
as some farm-league Diane Sawyer?

542
00:27:59,602 --> 00:28:00,718
Eh, call it a hunch.

543
00:28:17,203 --> 00:28:19,237
<i>I'm Ashley...</i>

544
00:28:20,823 --> 00:28:24,075
<i>I'm Ashley Frank,</i>
<i>bringing you "Frank Talk."</i>

545
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:25,844
<i>Let's do that again.</i>

546
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,780
<i>I'm Ashley Frank,</i>
<i>bringing you "Frank Talk."</i>

547
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:30,515
<i>Again.</i>

548
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,400
<i>I'm Ashley Frank.</i>

549
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:35,220
<i>Are organic fruits and veggies</i>
<i>really worth the cost?</i>

550
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:36,438
She's creepy.

551
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:38,273
I mean, the hair alone.

552
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,392
I don't know, man.
Maybe there's nothing here.

553
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:43,094
<i>Are we... we're spinning?</i>

554
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:45,030
<i>Do the new rent-to-own prices...</i>

555
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,049
<i>...A recent trend</i>
<i>in furniture stores...</i>

556
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:51,036
<i>...But think twice</i>
<i>before you decide to buy...</i>

557
00:28:51,103 --> 00:28:53,789
<i>Before you make that big purchase...</i>

558
00:28:53,856 --> 00:28:55,607
<i>Okay.</i>

559
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:02,130
<i>We'll ask the councilman</i>
<i>ourselves.</i>

560
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:05,834
<i>Are we still rolling?</i>

561
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:07,302
Hold on.

562
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:09,054
Check this out.

563
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,315
Zoom in on that.

564
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,176
Looks pretty normal, right?

565
00:30:05,228 --> 00:30:08,480
I'm sure inside it's
chock full of creep.

566
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:17,656
Ready?

567
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:19,357
Yeah.

568
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:21,042
- And that's...?
- Dog's blood.

569
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,194
Do I even want to know
where you got that?

570
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:26,030
Probably not.

571
00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:27,365
Ugh.

572
00:30:39,562 --> 00:30:40,845
All right, let's do this.

573
00:30:58,414 --> 00:31:00,248
So where is all the creep?

574
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:12,270
You came for dinner.

575
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:31,589
Mm. Sit tight.

576
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,325
You're up next.

577
00:32:56,732 --> 00:32:58,850
The tongue...

578
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:00,785
is the tastiest part.

579
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,621
It's where the lies roll off.

580
00:33:04,957 --> 00:33:06,691
Mmm.

581
00:33:08,494 --> 00:33:10,078
Mmm!

582
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:13,048
I cannot <i>wait</i> to eat yours.

583
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:15,467
I mean, I've seen liars before,
but you two?

584
00:33:17,253 --> 00:33:19,137
Gold standard.

585
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,059
Point of professional pride.

586
00:33:24,143 --> 00:33:26,377
I wouldn't be so
cocky if I were you, Dean.

587
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:30,148
You know what happens when you
base your life on lies, right?

588
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:34,319
The truth comes along and...

589
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:40,442
So, while you've
still got your tongue,

590
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:44,079
God knows you've got an earful.

591
00:33:44,163 --> 00:33:47,582
I think it's your
turn to spill some.

592
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:52,237
How 'bout we play a
little truth or truth?

593
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,957
What should we
ask Dean first, hmm?

594
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,542
Something...

595
00:33:57,593 --> 00:33:59,894
personal about you?

596
00:34:01,413 --> 00:34:05,216
Hey, Dean, I'm curious.

597
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:08,887
What do you really
feel about your brother?

598
00:34:14,743 --> 00:34:16,711
Better now.

599
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:19,180
As of yesterday, I wanted
to kill him in his sleep.

600
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:24,569
I thought he was a monster.

601
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,288
But now I think...

602
00:34:28,574 --> 00:34:31,259
Now you think what?

603
00:34:31,327 --> 00:34:33,745
He's just acting like me.

604
00:34:33,796 --> 00:34:35,430
What do you mean?

605
00:34:35,498 --> 00:34:36,714
It's the gig.

606
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,835
You're covered in blood until
you're covered in your own blood.

607
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,420
Half the time, you're about to die.

608
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:43,922
Like right now.

609
00:34:45,624 --> 00:34:48,426
I told myself I wanted out...

610
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:50,595
That I wanted a <i>family.</i>

611
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:52,096
But you were lying.

612
00:34:52,164 --> 00:34:54,682
No.

613
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:56,935
But what I'm good at...

614
00:34:56,986 --> 00:34:58,736
is slicing throats.

615
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:02,574
I ain't a father,

616
00:35:04,193 --> 00:35:06,244
I'm a killer...

617
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,646
and there's no changing that.

618
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:10,932
I know that <i>now.</i>

619
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,593
So, Sam walking back into your life

620
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,995
must have been a relief.

621
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:25,847
Hmm?

622
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:29,333
Mallory to your Mickey.

623
00:35:29,385 --> 00:35:34,005
And how do you feel about
the band getting back together?

624
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:35,106
Hmm, Sam?

625
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:48,203
Look...

626
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:50,705
what we do...

627
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:52,356
is hard,

628
00:35:54,192 --> 00:35:57,194
but... we watch out for each other

629
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:01,866
and that's what's important.

630
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:06,471
And that's it.

631
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:08,205
That's the truth.

632
00:36:09,592 --> 00:36:12,477
No.

633
00:36:12,544 --> 00:36:14,395
No, it's <i>not.</i>

634
00:36:16,181 --> 00:36:18,149
- You said yourself... I can't lie.
- How are you doing that?

635
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:21,251
That's not possible.
You're <i>lying</i> to me!

636
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:22,637
No, I'm not!

637
00:36:22,705 --> 00:36:24,955
What are you? What is he?

638
00:36:26,025 --> 00:36:27,525
I don't know what
you're talking about.

639
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,377
Really? I doubt that.

640
00:36:29,445 --> 00:36:33,081
I doubt anything that comes
out of your mouth right now.

641
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:34,165
You're not human.

642
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:36,584
What?

643
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:40,705
You didn't know that?

644
00:36:40,756 --> 00:36:43,207
Now, <i>that</i> I believe.

645
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:44,022
Dean, it's me.

646
00:37:44,073 --> 00:37:45,857
You are <i>not</i> my brother.

647
00:37:45,908 --> 00:37:46,992
Just listen.

648
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:47,943
What are you?!

649
00:37:48,027 --> 00:37:49,694
I'm me, Dean.

650
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:52,563
Look, please, just let me explain.

651
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:54,282
Why the hell should I believe
anything you say?

652
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:56,117
Okay, okay. You want
the truth? Here it is.

653
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:57,285
Here it is. God's honest.

654
00:37:58,871 --> 00:38:00,171
She was right.

655
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,357
There's something wrong
with me, really wrong.

656
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:04,758
I've known it for a while.

657
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:07,745
I lied to you. Yeah.

658
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:10,348
And... I let you get turned
by that vamp.

659
00:38:12,385 --> 00:38:14,052
Because I <i>knew there
was a cure, Dean,</i>

660
00:38:14,103 --> 00:38:15,270
and we <i>needed</i> in that nest!

661
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:17,704
- And I knew you could handle it!
- Handle it?!

662
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:19,557
I could've died!

663
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:21,059
I could've killed Ben.

664
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:22,911
And that should stop me cold.

665
00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:25,947
But I... I just don't <i>feel</i> it.

666
00:38:26,032 --> 00:38:27,699
You what?

667
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,868
Ever since I came back,

668
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:33,455
I am a... a better hunter
than I've ever been!

669
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:35,657
Nothing scares me anymore!

670
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:37,659
'Cause I can't <i>feel</i> it.

671
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:42,297
I don't know what's wrong with me.

672
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:47,752
I think...

673
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:49,304
I need help.
