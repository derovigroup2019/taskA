1
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:05,072
Yeah, I think these are
John Winchester's boys.

2
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:08,842
Hey, I'm Ellen.
That's my daughter, Jo.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,145
The can of whup ass
I ought to open on you.

4
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:12,712
You better put me
on speed dial, kid.

5
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:13,612
Yes, ma'am.

6
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:15,012
Those are hell
hounds out there, Dean.

7
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:15,998
We'll let the dogs in.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,930
You guys make a break
for the building next door

9
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,603
and I can wait here
with my finger on the button.

10
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,139
If I can get us a shot on
the devil, we have to take it.

11
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:24,740
I will not leave you here alone.

12
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:32,014
- It's civil war up there!
- I know.

13
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:34,584
If we can beat Raphael,
we can end this!

14
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:36,118
You did more than rebel.

15
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:37,486
You tore up
the whole script

16
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:39,155
and burned the pages
for all of us.

17
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:40,990
Do you have any idea
what souls are worth?

18
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:43,192
What power they hold?

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,594
Have you seen this man?

20
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:45,828
- Rufus Turner?
- No.

21
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:46,896
I ain't asking for no help.

22
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:47,997
Never seen that dick.

23
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:49,532
I'm not asking
for your permission.

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,766
Just like old times.

25
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:53,135
Long as I get to drive.

26
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:56,405
What are you?
Eve cooked me up herself.

27
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,075
The mother of all of us...

28
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,743
she has a message for you.

29
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,885
It was my fault.

30
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:45,021
Piece of crap.

31
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,001
Ah, damn it.

32
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:53,423
 Season 6 Episode 17
"My Heart Will Go On"

33
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:19,747
- Say something.
- You.

34
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,251
No. You.

35
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,065
Uh...

36
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,000
You two just gonna stand there

37
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:40,803
like the ugly girl at the prom,
or you gonna pitch in?

38
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,672
This so-called Eve,
Mother, whatever...

39
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,541
ain't gonna gank <i>herself.</i>

40
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:48,477
What's wrong with you two?

41
00:03:50,347 --> 00:03:52,214
Bobby, you haven't slept in days.

42
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:54,650
I sleep.
What are you, my wife now?

43
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:57,186
I'm just saying
that, you know,

44
00:03:57,254 --> 00:03:59,789
taking five might be a good thing.

45
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:00,756
For whom?

46
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,425
Look, Bobby,

47
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,661
it was...
it was tough for all of us,

48
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:07,096
seeing Rufus go like that.

49
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,264
You think this...

50
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,668
This ain't about Rufus.

51
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:14,737
Bobby, he wasn't just
a poker buddy.

52
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:17,473
You know when I knew
Rufus was done for?

53
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,908
The day I met him.

54
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,943
The only question was,
who first... him or me?

55
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,079
Now, you want to stand there
and therapize,

56
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:24,647
or you want to get me
some coffee?

57
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,016
Make it Irish.

58
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,722
Well, he's doing fantastic.

59
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,559
Yeah. This isn't
about Rufus at all.

60
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:38,227
Well, what do you
want to do?

61
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:39,895
I mean,
we can't just sit here

62
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:41,730
and watch him
poop out his liver.

63
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:44,400
Well, we could
get him out of the house.

64
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:45,568
There's a job.

65
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:47,303
Really?
What do you got?

66
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,238
Look.

67
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:51,107
Chester, Pennsylvania.

68
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:53,943
Three people got kicked off
in the last week,

69
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,277
all freaky.

70
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:57,947
Last guy got karate-chopped
by his garage door.

71
00:04:58,014 --> 00:04:59,715
And these are all
blood relatives.

72
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:01,851
- What do you think, family curse?
- Could be.

73
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:03,152
Hey, grumpy...

74
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:06,589
You, uh...

75
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:09,425
I don't want to do crap.
Leave me alone.

76
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:12,495
Just... get out of my house,
both of you.

77
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,296
You're driving me nuts.

78
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:15,997
Bobby.

79
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,399
Now!

80
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,735
For the love of Pete.

81
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:42,925
You know, maybe we should wait
till she gets back.

82
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:44,493
Dude, she just called
from the road,

83
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,095
said she'd be here
in "two shakes."

84
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:47,563
You really want to sit around

85
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,064
and smell him
stew in his juices?

86
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:50,933
Yeah, yeah. Drive.

87
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:06,448
What the...

88
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,951
Tell me you haven't been
drinking this whole time.

89
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,086
You're worse than the boys.
I'm working.

90
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:12,488
My God.

91
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:15,391
I'm gone a week, and this place
goes completely to hell.

92
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,560
What is wrong with you,
Bobby Singer?

93
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,162
Get a pen.
It's a long list.

94
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,331
You smell like a bar,
you know that?

95
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,867
You don't exactly
smell like a rose yourself.

96
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:26,835
Huh. Yeah,
I been hunting with Jo.

97
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,070
What's your excuse?

98
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,406
If I need one,
I got a good one.

99
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,146
I know.

100
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:40,382
And I'm so sorry.

101
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,151
He meant a lot
to me, too.

102
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:48,490
Go wash up.
I'll fix us something.

103
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:51,327
Anybody ever tell you
you're a pain in the ass?

104
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,598
That's why you married me.

105
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,666
Go.

106
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:00,102
Don't tell me
what to do, Ellen.

107
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:18,787
Not a bleep.

108
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,825
Well, not a vengeful
spirit, then.

109
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:24,159
So what is it?

110
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,937
Huh.

111
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,207
Whatch you got?

112
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:43,112
What is that,
Christmas tinsel?

113
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:44,046
I don't know.

114
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:55,157
It's gold.

115
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,959
You mean, like,
<i>gold,</i> gold?

116
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:58,327
Why would a handyman have gold

117
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,396
just lying around in his garage?

118
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:01,764
I don't know.

119
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:04,933
There is definitely a skeleton
in this family's closet.

120
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:07,836
I mean, accidents
don't just happen accidentally.

121
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,806
You know what I mean.

122
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:13,942
All right. How about
I'll go check family records,

123
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,544
you go with next of kin?

124
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:17,478
Yeah.

125
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:22,651
On the courthouse steps...
for the deposition.

126
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,787
No, I told you,
3:00 p.m.

127
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:26,322
No, my usual fees.

128
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,590
I got to go, Ma.

129
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,429
I'm sorry.
Uh, what department?

130
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:34,797
Genealogy.
From the university.

131
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:36,498
W-w-we're doing a study
on local families,

132
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:37,933
and, well,
the Russos are a big one...

133
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,335
Yeah, you know what?

134
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:41,603
I got to tell you, I am
extremely busy right now, so...

135
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:43,372
Yeah, I-I'm sure you've had
a rough week.

136
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,840
I, uh, read
about the recent tragedies.

137
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,442
Your cousins, right?

138
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,043
Yeah. It's a shame.

139
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,814
But I'm not that close
with my family, so, uh...

140
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,482
Is this gonna take long?

141
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,451
No. Five minutes.
Five minutes.

142
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:56,819
Uh, can you...
can you tell me

143
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:59,288
anything noteworthy
about the Russos?

144
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:01,190
Noteworthy?
No.

145
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,359
I mean, not exactly...
average,

146
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:04,893
you know,
big, from Italy.

147
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,195
I see.

148
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:10,566
Uh, was anyone ever
killed or maimed in a war

149
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,803
or... you know,
some other violent thing?

150
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:17,172
What do you mean?

151
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,609
Like something so dark that it
would Sully future generations.

152
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:22,578
Uh...

153
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,779
No.

154
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:26,715
Good. Good stuff.

155
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,751
Anyone own a slave?

156
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:31,754
What?

157
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,122
Routine question.

158
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,957
Any ties to the Nazi party?

159
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:37,226
Excuse me?

160
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:39,594
Did grandma ever
piss off a gypsy?

161
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,631
Okay, you know what?

162
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:44,666
I don't know
what kind of study you're doing,

163
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,935
but it's over right now,
so, if you don't mind...

164
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,704
Okay, I-I'll just
cut to the chase here.

165
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:51,373
Um, your life is in danger.

166
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:53,409
What?
What is that, a-a threat?

167
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:54,676
Are you threatening me?!

168
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,678
No, no, no. No, no.
I'm not threatening you.

169
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:58,614
I'm just simply saying that...

170
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,949
If you don't watch your back,
you're gonna die.

171
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:03,886
Get the hell out of my office.

172
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:05,454
- Okay.
- Now!

173
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,593
- Hey.
- Sam.

174
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:14,563
Find anything?

175
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:16,498
One ass-hat
in a shiny suit. You?

176
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:19,268
Not much. Great grandparents
born in Calabria.

177
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,603
Emigrated 1912.
Been here ever since.

178
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,572
What,
no severed horse head?

179
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,607
Ha. Four generations
of picket fence.

180
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,510
If these people
are the Waltons,

181
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:30,045
then why the hell
are they dying?

182
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,050
Well, how about Cuba?

183
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:37,219
It's beautiful
this time of year.

184
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:39,588
And the new Trump casino...
amazing.

185
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:42,257
Don't worry about the kids.
There's a wave pool.

186
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,926
Oh! Sure, yeah!

187
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:05,347
Look, if you like
cigars, Cher, or the circus,

188
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,949
it's all about Havana.

189
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:12,087
Yes, I've seen the Shatner ads,

190
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:13,889
but you know what they don't have?

191
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:16,725
Personal touch.

192
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:20,295
Okay, then.
I'll e-mail you some details.

193
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:21,296
You too.

194
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,590
Aah!

195
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:55,293
Anne Witting.

196
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,329
We sure
she's not a Russo,

197
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:59,631
a second cousin
twice removed or something?

198
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:02,167
No, I checked the records twice.
She's not related.

199
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:07,739
Oh, if this isn't a family
curse, then what the hell is it?

200
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:08,740
You got me.

201
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:10,409
I got nothing.

202
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:16,882
Hold on.

203
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:23,789
Not nothing.

204
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:30,796
So, we found
another piece of this,

205
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:32,264
I don't know, shiny string.

206
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:33,565
I was afraid of that.

207
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,033
Why? What's up?

208
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:38,570
Oh, these so-called accidents...
we're seeing 'em nationwide.

209
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:40,005
About 75 so far.

210
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:42,808
I got Jo and her crew working
on a cluster in California.

211
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,176
Hey. Hey. Hey.

212
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:46,044
Blood relatives?

213
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:47,179
Some yeah, some no.

214
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:48,980
She's got
about what you do...

215
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:51,516
pile of bodies and
a whole bunch of gold thread.

216
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,585
- So what's it mean?
- I don't know.

217
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:55,287
I got Bobby working on it
right now.

218
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:59,157
How's he doing, by the way?

219
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:00,525
Oh, don't worry.

220
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:02,727
I'm kicking his ass
back to health and happiness.

221
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:05,464
Who asked you to?
To hell with you.

222
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:06,898
I heard that.

223
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:08,433
He'll be okay.

224
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:10,202
Are you okay?

225
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:11,937
Oh, honey, you're sweet.

226
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:14,873
You know me.
I just worry about you boys.

227
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:16,007
Yeah, well...

228
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:17,576
All right,
so, all these corpses...

229
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:18,844
anything relate 'em?

230
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:21,246
Well, actually,
I did dig up one thing.

231
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:22,614
I just don't know
what to make of it.

232
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:24,049
Hit me.

233
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:26,685
Well, it's a weird one,
and it was buried pretty deep,

234
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:28,987
but Bobby and me
were combing through

235
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:32,257
the family trees on all the
victims, and we started seeing,

236
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:35,160
well, the families all came over
to America the same year.

237
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:36,294
- Hm.
- Yeah. 1912.

238
00:14:36,362 --> 00:14:38,063
But here's
the real weird part...

239
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,165
they all came over
on the same boat.

240
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:41,500
- Really?
- Yep.

241
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:44,469
All right, so what's so special
about the boat?

242
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:47,205
Nothing. It was a boat.
It did what boats do.

243
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:49,374
What was it called?

244
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:51,877
The <i>Titanic.</i>
You ever hear of it?

245
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:52,911
No.

246
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,546
Yeah, me neither.

247
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:56,681
I'll keep digging.

248
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:58,049
All right.

249
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:04,155
Does the name <i>Titanic</i>
ring a bell?

250
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:05,690
<i>Titanic?</i>

251
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,394
No.

252
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,500
"The RMS <i>Titanic</i>

253
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:18,003
was the largest passenger
steamship in the world

254
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,905
when it made
its maiden voyage

255
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:22,007
across the north Atlantic
in 1912."

256
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:23,575
So what's the big
friggin' deal?

257
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:24,743
It's a ship.
It sailed.

258
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,378
Yeah, I don't know.

259
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:28,647
Um...

260
00:15:28,714 --> 00:15:30,649
Oh, looks like
there was a close call.

261
00:15:30,716 --> 00:15:32,050
Ship almost hit an iceberg.

262
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:33,885
Almost? So?

263
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:35,687
So, uh,

264
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:38,189
looks like the first mate
spotted it just in time.

265
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:41,726
Good for him.
There anything else?

266
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,028
Wait a second.

267
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:44,563
What?

268
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,600
Uh, this first mate...
Mr. I.P. Freeley.

269
00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:51,970
Well, that's not suspicious.

270
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:54,172
You got a picture
of old Freeley?

271
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,778
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

272
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:02,113
Let's see.

273
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:10,220
Balthazar.

274
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,806
Boys, boys, boys.
Whatever can I do for you?

275
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,374
We need to talk.

276
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:31,009
Oh, you seem upset, Dean.

277
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,244
The hell with the boat,
Balthazar.

278
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:34,245
What boat?

279
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:35,280
The <i>Titanic.</i>

280
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:36,314
Oh!

281
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:37,983
Yeah. The <i>Titanic.</i>

282
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,319
Yes, well, uh, it was meant
to sink, and I saved it.

283
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:43,755
What?

284
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:46,858
It was meant to bash
into this iceberg thing

285
00:16:46,926 --> 00:16:49,427
and plunge into the briny deep
with all this hoopla,

286
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:50,495
and I saved it.

287
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:52,297
Anything else
I can answer for you?

288
00:16:52,365 --> 00:16:53,665
Why?

289
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:54,699
Why what?

290
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,501
Why did you un-sink the ship?

291
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:58,503
Oh, because I hated the movie.

292
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:01,539
- What movie?
- Exactly.

293
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:05,043
Wait, so you saved
a cruise liner because...

294
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,012
Because that God-awful
Celine Dion song

295
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,513
made me want to smite myself.

296
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:10,215
Who's Celine Dion?

297
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:12,684
Oh, she's a destitute Lounge
singer somewhere in Quebec,

298
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:14,319
and let's keep it that way,
please.

299
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:16,521
Okay, I didn't think
that was possible.

300
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,590
I thought you couldn't
change history.

301
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:20,191
Oh, haven't you noticed?

302
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:22,694
There's no more rules, boys.

303
00:17:23,796 --> 00:17:24,763
Wow.

304
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:27,465
The nerve on you.

305
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:30,568
So you just, what,
un-sunk a giant boat?

306
00:17:30,636 --> 00:17:32,637
Oh, come on. I saved people.

307
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:34,606
I thought you loved
that kind of thing.

308
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:36,408
Yeah, but now those people
and their kids,

309
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:38,109
and their kids' kids...

310
00:17:38,177 --> 00:17:40,645
they must have interacted
with so many other people,

311
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:42,447
changed so much crap.

312
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:44,549
You totally butterfly-effected
history!

313
00:17:44,617 --> 00:17:45,617
Dude. Dude.

314
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:47,419
Rule one,
no Kutcher references.

315
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:50,321
Ah, yes. Unfortunately,
there's still an Ashton Kutcher.

316
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:52,424
And you still averted
the Apocalypse,

317
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:54,259
and there are still
archangels.

318
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:56,828
It's just the small details
that are different,

319
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:59,164
like you don't drive
an Impala.

320
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:02,734
Yes, yes.
"What's an Impala?"

321
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:04,669
Trust me,
it's not important.

322
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:08,039
And, of course,
Ellen and Jo are alive.

323
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:09,507
Ellen and Jo? What?

324
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:11,843
Yes, they're
supposed to be dead.

325
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:16,381
You see, I save a boat,
one thing leads to another,

326
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:18,316
which leads
to another thousand things,

327
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:19,350
and yada, yada, yada.

328
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:20,752
To cut a long story short,

329
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,253
they don't die
in a massive explosion.

330
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:25,824
Mm.

331
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:27,258
Anyway, let's agree
I did a good thing.

332
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:28,860
One less
Billy Zane movie,

333
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:31,196
and I saved
two of your closest friends.

334
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:33,231
But now
somebody is killing

335
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,433
the descendants
of the survivors.

336
00:18:36,635 --> 00:18:37,769
And?

337
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:42,440
And that's maybe
like 50,000 people.

338
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:44,609
And?

339
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:46,411
And we need to save
as many as we can,

340
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,079
but we need to know
who's after 'em.

341
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:49,280
Oh, oh, sorry.

342
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:51,015
You have me confused
with the other angel...

343
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,917
you know, the one
in the dirty trench-coat

344
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:54,052
who's in love with you.

345
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,386
I...

346
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:56,588
don't care.

347
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:00,859
Goodbye, boys.

348
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,193
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

349
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:05,296
Son of a bitch!

350
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:08,500
So, Balthazar
un-sank a boat,

351
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:10,201
and now we got
a boatload of people

352
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:11,703
who should
never have been born.

353
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,805
Yeah. Like 50,000.

354
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:15,273
Makes sense.

355
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:17,976
How does any of this
make sense?

356
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:20,011
Because I got an idea
who we're up against.

357
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,379
What?

358
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:22,680
Fate.

359
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:24,215
You mean...

360
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:25,683
I mean Fate, like <i>the</i> Fates.

361
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:28,853
Or one of 'em, at least.

362
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:31,422
You mean like Greek mythology?
Like the sisters?

363
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,390
Bingo.

364
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,558
Nerd.

365
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:35,860
These ladies are responsible

366
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:38,296
for how you go down, literally.

367
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:40,999
So if you get creamed
by a garage door

368
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:43,234
or crunched by a copy machine,

369
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:46,471
they're the ones who hammer out
the details of how you die.

370
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:49,774
Spin out your fate
on a piece of pure gold.

371
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:50,775
Gold thread.

372
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:55,547
And then one of 'em
writes it all down

373
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:57,148
in her day runner of death.

374
00:19:57,216 --> 00:19:59,217
High-level stuff.

375
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:01,152
Anyway... fits.

376
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,321
Now we know
what Balthazar did.

377
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:04,789
It seems to me

378
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:07,926
that maybe fate is just
trying to clean up the mess.

379
00:20:07,993 --> 00:20:10,795
So, how do we stop it?

380
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:13,598
How do we stop fate?
Good question.

381
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:14,833
Well, there's got to be a way.

382
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,134
Or there ain't.

383
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:17,802
I mean, this is fate
we're talking about here.

384
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,038
You know,
the easiest way would be

385
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:22,340
to get that angel
to re-sink the boat.

386
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:24,309
No. No way. Forget it.

387
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:25,710
Big difference

388
00:20:25,778 --> 00:20:28,012
between dying awful
and never being born, Dean.

389
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,181
We are not
sinking the boat, Bobby.

390
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:32,050
Okay?
Don't even think about it.

391
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:34,519
Well, okay. What's got
your panties in a clench?

392
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:36,855
Nothing.

393
00:20:36,922 --> 00:20:38,890
Try that again?

394
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,259
It...

395
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:45,897
Look, it... it... it doesn't
even really matter, but...

396
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:48,333
But?

397
00:20:50,903 --> 00:20:55,173
Apparently, a crap-load
of dominoes get tipped over

398
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:56,708
if the <i>Titanic</i> goes down.

399
00:20:57,943 --> 00:21:00,411
And, bottom line...

400
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:03,748
Ellen and Jo die.

401
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:25,069
Okay, you two listen up.

402
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:28,439
You make sure...

403
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:31,242
Keep those angels
from sinking that boat.

404
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,577
You understand me?

405
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:33,611
- Yeah.
- Yes.

406
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,213
Yeah, Bobby, of course.

407
00:21:44,757 --> 00:21:46,658
Oh, he's bad enough
<i>with</i> her.

408
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:48,793
Think how he'd be
if she was gone.

409
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:51,162
Yeah.

410
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,932
So, what do we do?

411
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:58,336
I mean, how do we save
50,000 people?

412
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,438
I got no freakin' clue.

413
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:03,841
Yeah. We don't even know
who they are.

414
00:22:05,177 --> 00:22:06,744
Well, we know <i>one.</i>

415
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,961
That's him. Let's go.

416
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,100
Hello.

417
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:30,902
Yeah. What?

418
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,403
Mr. Russo!

419
00:22:32,471 --> 00:22:35,139
I don't care.
Send him a fruitcake.

420
00:22:39,878 --> 00:22:40,845
Shawn!
Who's the judge?

421
00:22:41,914 --> 00:22:43,247
Russo!

422
00:22:43,315 --> 00:22:46,117
All right, send him
a nice bottle of champagne.

423
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:48,219
Shawn! But nothing more than
$30... ah, no. 20 bucks.

424
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:49,821
Believe me, this guy...
he owes me a favor.

425
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:52,023
Russo, stop!

426
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,301
Get off of me.

427
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:05,770
And you... I told you
to leave me alone, didn't I?!

428
00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:07,638
Look, we're just trying
to help you out, okay?

429
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:09,407
Help me?! You almost killed me,
you lunatic.

430
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,476
Give me that.
Unbelievable.

431
00:23:11,543 --> 00:23:12,744
Russo! Hey!

432
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:16,546
Just be glad I'm not suing your ass!

433
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:30,629
You've got to be kidding me.

434
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,278
Sam, check it out.

435
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:38,346
What?

436
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:43,851
Too soon?

437
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,053
Yeah, Dean.

438
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,522
I'm pretty sure
six seconds is too soon.

439
00:24:00,094 --> 00:24:01,862
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

440
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:03,697
I think I saw her.

441
00:24:03,764 --> 00:24:05,298
Right over there.

442
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:07,167
- Her? Like <i>Fate</i> her?
- Yeah.

443
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:08,468
What'd she look like?

444
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,871
Kind of like a librarian.

445
00:24:12,606 --> 00:24:14,841
Your kind of librarian
or my kind of librarian?

446
00:24:16,744 --> 00:24:19,278
Well, she was wearing clothes,
if that's what you mean.

447
00:24:19,346 --> 00:24:20,780
- All right.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

448
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:23,149
Wait, wait, wait.
We can't just walk over there.

449
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:24,417
We're not on the hit list.

450
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:25,718
We have nothing to do
with the boat.

451
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:26,686
Let's go talk to her.

452
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:27,854
Talk.

453
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:29,088
Yeah, you know.

454
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:33,059
Talk.
Worth a shot, right?

455
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:44,003
Hello?

456
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:48,801
Hello?

457
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:57,877
Oh, come on.

458
00:25:57,945 --> 00:25:58,978
You got a lighter?

459
00:25:59,046 --> 00:25:59,979
Yeah.

460
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:00,913
Okay.

461
00:26:07,454 --> 00:26:09,021
Oh, come on.
It's out of juice or something?

462
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:11,123
It shouldn't be.

463
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:25,171
Cass!

464
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:28,740
- Hello, Dean. Sam.
- Hey. Thanks, man!

465
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:31,010
Where are we?

466
00:26:31,078 --> 00:26:32,378
White Russia.

467
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:33,312
What?!

468
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,486
Are you aware
of what your frat bro did?

469
00:26:40,554 --> 00:26:42,955
I'm aware.
Balthazar can be impetuous.

470
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:44,290
Well, riddle me this...

471
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:46,158
if fate's going after
the boat people,

472
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:47,894
why'd she try to waste
me and Sam?

473
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:49,462
Well, I imagine
she harbors

474
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,430
a certain degree of rage
toward you.

475
00:26:51,498 --> 00:26:52,331
What did we do?

476
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,302
Nothing of import...
just the tiny matter

477
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,605
of averting the apocalypse
and rendering her obsolete.

478
00:26:59,673 --> 00:27:02,675
I think maybe she's a little
irritated about that.

479
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:06,245
And then you go and dangle
yourselves in front of her...

480
00:27:06,313 --> 00:27:08,948
So we've pissed fate off
personally.

481
00:27:09,016 --> 00:27:11,150
If I know her...
and I do...

482
00:27:11,218 --> 00:27:13,019
she won't stop
until you're dead.

483
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:15,321
Awesome.

484
00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:18,190
So what do we do?

485
00:27:18,258 --> 00:27:19,392
Kill her.

486
00:27:21,828 --> 00:27:22,762
Kill fate?

487
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:27,033
Do you have
another suggestion?

488
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,035
No, I'm...
I just mean, uh...

489
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:30,336
Can you even do that?

490
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:32,738
Balthazar has a weapon
that will work against her.

491
00:27:32,806 --> 00:27:34,140
Of course he does.
Yeah.

492
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:35,841
Boy, that guy's just
got it covered, doesn't he?

493
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:37,143
You need
new friends, Cass.

494
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,146
I'm trying to save
the ones I have, Dean.

495
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:45,484
We'll have to
draw her out.

496
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:48,220
All right, well, uh,
she's gunning for us.

497
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:50,723
She's bound to surface
again eventually.

498
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:54,260
We'll make it easy
for her.

499
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:56,829
I think you have
an expression for it.

500
00:27:56,897 --> 00:27:58,331
"Tempting Fate."

501
00:28:03,036 --> 00:28:06,472
Yeah, well,
you just be careful.

502
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,576
That was Jo. 30 more dead
on the west coast.

503
00:28:10,644 --> 00:28:14,046
What exactly do those boys
think they're gonna do?

504
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:17,083
It's the boys.

505
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,353
If anybody can pull this out
of their ass, it's those two.

506
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,822
Yeah, you ever hear the saying
"you can't stop fate"?

507
00:28:24,424 --> 00:28:27,960
You know, cleanest fix
would be just to sink the boat.

508
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:29,395
Why would you say that?

509
00:28:29,463 --> 00:28:31,330
Well, because, right now
they're all dying bloody.

510
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:33,366
It's not the same
as never being born.

511
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:37,403
You're talking about people...

512
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:38,871
People who are loved...

513
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,408
Who would be missed.

514
00:28:46,713 --> 00:28:48,481
What the hell is up with you?

515
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:50,616
Nothing.

516
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:54,220
Oh, please.
You are a neon sign.

517
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,060
So, I can beat it
out of you,

518
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:03,295
or we could just skip
that part... dealer's choice.

519
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:18,110
So, not just me, but Jo, too?

520
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:26,952
They're not gonna sink
the boat. I promise.

521
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:31,257
The boat stays.
You don't have to worry.

522
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:34,827
Well...

523
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:37,663
If it was meant to be,
then...

524
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:39,532
I guess whatever happens,
happens.

525
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,368
But that's just my point.
Nothing's "meant to be."

526
00:29:42,436 --> 00:29:45,438
Whether we're together is
at the whim of some dick angel.

527
00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:47,173
Oh, Bobby, relax.

528
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,207
I can't.

529
00:29:50,343 --> 00:29:51,944
We need you.

530
00:29:53,947 --> 00:29:56,348
Especially me.

531
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:00,319
I know.

532
00:30:15,102 --> 00:30:19,038
Okay, so, we're just gonna meet
our fate at any time, right?

533
00:30:19,106 --> 00:30:20,139
Yeah.

534
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:22,274
Just walk.
Act natural.

535
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:32,718
Okay.

536
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:34,019
That's fine.

537
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:06,852
Oh, you got to be
kidding me.

538
00:31:13,693 --> 00:31:15,594
All right, just... just
Keep walking.

539
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,004
Sam, they're juggling knives.

540
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:26,272
- And hatchets.
- Yeah, I know.

541
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,215
Can't avoid fate.

542
00:31:49,663 --> 00:31:50,462
Ah.

543
00:31:58,471 --> 00:32:00,005
All right. I don't get it.

544
00:32:00,073 --> 00:32:01,407
I don't either.

545
00:32:01,474 --> 00:32:03,776
Who do you got to kill
to get killed around here?

546
00:32:03,844 --> 00:32:04,944
Maybe Cass was wrong.

547
00:32:05,011 --> 00:32:05,945
Look out!

548
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:32,630
Castiel.

549
00:32:37,903 --> 00:32:39,303
Atropos.

550
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:41,972
You look well.

551
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,708
I look like stomped-over crap,
because of you.

552
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:46,510
All right,
let's talk about this.

553
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:48,479
Talk? About what?

554
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:51,248
Maybe about how you
and those two circus clowns

555
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:52,416
destroyed my work.

556
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:54,318
You ruined my life.

557
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:55,519
Let's not get emotional.

558
00:32:55,587 --> 00:32:57,288
Not get emotional?!

559
00:32:57,355 --> 00:32:58,622
I had a job.

560
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,391
God gave me a job.

561
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,760
We all had a script.

562
00:33:02,828 --> 00:33:04,228
I worked hard.

563
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:07,765
I was really, really good
at what I did...

564
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:10,034
Until the day
of the big prize fight.

565
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:13,103
And then what happens?
You throw out the book!

566
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,706
Well, I'm sorry.

567
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:17,575
But freedom
is more preferable.

568
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:21,212
Freedom? This is chaos!
How is it better?

569
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,913
You know,
I even went to heaven

570
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:25,382
just to ask what to do next,
and you know what?

571
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,784
No one
would even talk to me.

572
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:28,919
There are more pressing
matters at hand.

573
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:31,088
But I don't know
what happens next.

574
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:32,890
I need to know.
It's what I <i>do.</i>

575
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,491
I'm sorry.

576
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,194
But your services
are no longer required.

577
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:43,334
You know what?

578
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:45,069
I've kept my mouth shut.

579
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:47,805
I could have complained,
I could have raised a fuss,

580
00:33:47,873 --> 00:33:49,173
but I didn't.

581
00:33:49,241 --> 00:33:52,409
But you know
what the last straw is?

582
00:33:52,477 --> 00:33:54,612
Un-sinking the <i>Titanic.</i>

583
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:57,815
You changed the future.
You cannot change the past.

584
00:33:57,883 --> 00:33:59,250
That is going too far!

585
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:01,751
- It's Balthazar. He's erratic...
- Bull crap.

586
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,488
This isn't about
some stupid movie.

587
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:06,323
He's under your orders.

588
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:10,060
You sent him back
to save that ship.

589
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:11,228
No, I didn't.

590
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:13,697
Why would I?

591
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:16,233
Oh, maybe because you're
in the middle of a war

592
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:17,334
and you're desperate?

593
00:34:18,403 --> 00:34:21,639
Come on.
This is about the souls.

594
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,475
You don't know
what you're talking about.

595
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:26,377
That angel went and created

596
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:30,547
50,000 new souls
for your war machine.

597
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:32,483
You're confused.

598
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,218
No.

599
00:34:34,286 --> 00:34:36,921
You can't just mint money, Castiel.

600
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:39,089
It's wrong...

601
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:40,891
It's dangerous...

602
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:42,426
And I won't let you.

603
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:49,767
You don't have a choice.

604
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:51,335
Maybe I don't.

605
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:53,504
So here's
a choice for you.

606
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:56,340
If you don't go back
and sink that boat,

607
00:34:56,408 --> 00:35:00,077
I'm gonna kill
your two favorite pets.

608
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:04,081
I won't let you.

609
00:35:04,149 --> 00:35:05,816
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do?

610
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:08,418
Do you really want to test me?

611
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:12,489
Okay. Fine.

612
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:14,692
But think about this...

613
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:17,161
I've got
two sisters out there.

614
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:20,431
They're bigger,
in every sense of the word.

615
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:21,999
Kill me...

616
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:24,068
Sam and Dean are target one.

617
00:35:24,135 --> 00:35:26,170
For simple vengeance.

618
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:31,842
You're not fighting a war
or anything, right?

619
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,878
You can watch them
every millisecond of every day.

620
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:37,648
Because
maybe you've heard...

621
00:35:37,716 --> 00:35:41,018
fate strikes
when you least expect it.

622
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,654
Balthazar, stop.

623
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:46,090
Ah.

624
00:35:47,092 --> 00:35:48,258
Awkward.

625
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:50,694
Set things right

626
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,596
before I flick
your precious boys off a cliff

627
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:53,664
just on principle.

628
00:35:53,732 --> 00:35:55,232
Uh, sweetie,
before we go, um,

629
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,934
I <i>could</i> remove that stick
from your...

630
00:35:57,002 --> 00:35:58,969
Don't try me.

631
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:01,171
Oh. We'll leave it
inserted, then.

632
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:07,211
All right, then.

633
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:10,381
Let's sink the <i>Titanic.</i>

634
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:52,006
Dude,
what time is it?

635
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:56,744
I-I just had
<i>the</i> weirdest dream.

636
00:36:56,812 --> 00:36:59,080
20 bucks says mine was weirder.
I am <i>not</i> kidding.

637
00:36:59,147 --> 00:37:00,848
No, no.
I'm not kidding either.

638
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:02,717
I-I mean, it was...

639
00:37:02,784 --> 00:37:04,318
Just bizarre.

640
00:37:04,386 --> 00:37:07,788
Mine had
the actual <i>Titanic</i> in it.

641
00:37:08,856 --> 00:37:09,689
What?

642
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:12,258
There something on my face?

643
00:37:13,928 --> 00:37:15,161
D-did it, uh...

644
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:16,764
Not sink,

645
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:18,566
because Balthazar...

646
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:20,867
had a hate on for Billy Zane?

647
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,003
Why are you
having my dreams, dude?

648
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:25,272
It wasn't a dream.

649
00:37:26,508 --> 00:37:27,742
Wait, what?

650
00:37:29,678 --> 00:37:31,479
You're saying
this actually happened?

651
00:37:31,546 --> 00:37:34,014
That t-the whole...
whatever... t-that was real?

652
00:37:34,582 --> 00:37:36,149
Yes.

653
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:38,219
So, what happened?

654
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:40,955
Well, I insisted
he go back in time

655
00:37:41,022 --> 00:37:42,490
and correct
what he'd done.

656
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:43,591
What?

657
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:45,290
Why?

658
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:47,661
It was the only way
to be sure you were safe.

659
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:52,532
So...

660
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,668
So, you killed...

661
00:37:54,736 --> 00:37:56,837
50,000 people for us.

662
00:37:59,674 --> 00:38:02,743
No, I didn't.
They were never born.

663
00:38:05,313 --> 00:38:09,981
That's far different from being
killed, wouldn't you say?

664
00:38:13,955 --> 00:38:15,489
Ellen and Jo?

665
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,330
I'm sorry.

666
00:38:28,703 --> 00:38:30,137
Hold on.

667
00:38:30,204 --> 00:38:32,439
Uh...

668
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:37,411
So, if you guys went
a-and changed everything back,

669
00:38:37,478 --> 00:38:41,448
then that whole time-line
or whatever, it just got erased?

670
00:38:41,516 --> 00:38:43,850
Yeah. More or less.

671
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:46,320
Well, then, how come
he and I remember it?

672
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:48,755
Because I wanted you
to remember it.

673
00:38:48,823 --> 00:38:50,657
Why?

674
00:38:50,725 --> 00:38:53,360
I wanted you to know
who fate really is.

675
00:38:53,428 --> 00:38:55,429
She's cruel and capricious.

676
00:38:55,496 --> 00:38:57,097
I'd go so far as "bitch."

677
00:38:57,165 --> 00:38:58,265
Well, yeah.

678
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,901
You're the ones who taught me

679
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:04,237
that you can make
your own destiny.

680
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:06,940
You don't have to be ruled
by fate.

681
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,110
You can choose freedom.

682
00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:13,213
I still believe that that's
something worth fighting for.

683
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,484
I just wanted you
to understand that.

684
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:22,956
So, wait.

685
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:27,027
Did... Balthazar
really, uh,

686
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:29,062
unravel the sweater
over a chick flick?

687
00:39:30,798 --> 00:39:32,265
Yes.

688
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,301
Absolutely.
That's what he did.

689
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:37,304
Wow. Well, might be time to
take away his cable privileges.

690
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:41,474
Besides, "Titanic"
didn't suck <i>that</i> bad.

691
00:39:42,243 --> 00:39:43,577
Winslet's rack.

692
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:49,683
I'll tell you
one thing about Cass,

693
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:51,418
he does not appreciate
the finer things.

694
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:08,368
I guess things
are back to normal, huh?

695
00:40:08,436 --> 00:40:10,971
"Normal." Awesome.

696
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:15,008
Poor bastard.

697
00:40:15,076 --> 00:40:17,377
Doesn't even know
how good he had it.

698
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:19,579
Yeah, well, what he doesn't know
won't hurt him.

699
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:21,014
I say we keep
our mouths shut.

700
00:40:21,082 --> 00:40:23,150
Yeah. I'm with you.

701
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:25,018
Should we wake him?

702
00:40:25,086 --> 00:40:27,054
Nah.

703
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:30,957
That's probably
the best he's felt all week.
