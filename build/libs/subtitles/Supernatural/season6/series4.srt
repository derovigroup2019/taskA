1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:02,756
Name's Crowley.

2
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:04,375
<i>You're</i> Crowley?

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:05,559
I see
you <i>have</i> heard of me.

4
00:00:05,627 --> 00:00:06,827
I can give you
anything you want, mate.

5
00:00:06,895 --> 00:00:09,046
- All I need is...
- My soul.

6
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,097
You sold your soul?

7
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:12,049
Oh, more like pawned it.

8
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,500
- I fully intend to give it back.
- Well, then give it back!

9
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:15,302
- I can't.
- Can't or won't?

10
00:00:15,353 --> 00:00:17,388
I won't, all right?
It's insurance.

11
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:20,007
- Rufus Turner. He's a hunter.
- One of your old friends?

12
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:23,227
Friend? He's not
the Christmas-card type.

13
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:24,511
Gentlemen.
I'm Sheriff Jody Mills.

14
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:26,230
I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

15
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:27,481
Agent Willis speaking.

16
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:28,732
- Bobby?
- Oh...

17
00:00:28,817 --> 00:00:30,084
So you know Bobby Singer?

18
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:31,518
Bobby, I thought
the Sheriff hated you?

19
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,487
She <i>did</i>
<i>till five days ago.</i>

20
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,072
What happened
five days ago?

21
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:36,740
The dead started rising
all over town.

22
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:40,044
Bobby, you just
gonna sit there?

23
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:41,645
No, I'm gonna Riverdance.

24
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:43,631
Really wasted
that crossroads deal.

25
00:00:49,337 --> 00:00:50,387
Son of a bitch.

26
00:00:50,472 --> 00:00:52,556
Hello...
king of the crossroads.

27
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:53,707
Are you okay?

28
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:55,175
Yeah, I'm great.

29
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:57,645
'Cause there's been a few times
that you got me wondering.

30
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:00,047
- Something's different with you.
- I'm okay.

31
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:01,482
You went to hell, Sam.

32
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:09,440
<i>Yesterday, this Galveston</i>
<i>shoreline was being pounded</i>

33
00:01:09,524 --> 00:01:13,611
<i>by 10-foot swells and winds</i>
<i>up to 150 miles per hour.</i>

34
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:16,030
<i>But today, well,</i>
<i>there's not a cloud in sight.</i>

35
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,565
<i>Hurricane Tiffany has broken up</i>
<i>over the Gulf,</i>

36
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:21,585
<i>and our 5-day forecast</i>
<i>calls for nothing...</i>

37
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,954
<i>...But sun and clear skies.</i>

38
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,756
<i>I guess somebody up there</i>
<i>likes us.</i>

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,174
<i>Thank you, Phil...</i>

40
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,460
<i>Et ad congregandum...</i>

41
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:33,413
<i>Eos coram me.</i>

42
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:39,336
Been making merry,
have we?

43
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:40,521
Bite me.

44
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:43,524
If that's your thing.

45
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:50,781
That swan dive of Sam's
was a thing of beauty.

46
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:53,150
Tens all the way 'round,

47
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:55,285
standing "O"
from the Romanian judge.

48
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,371
You should be proud, Bobby.

49
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,456
As deaths go,
it wasn't too shabby.

50
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,442
Cheer up, mate!

51
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:04,078
We just saved the sodding world
together.

52
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:05,079
Me?

53
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,413
I've been celebrating.

54
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,716
I hate to see what you call
"celebrating."

55
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:09,800
Yes, you would.

56
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:11,635
Drink?

57
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,803
No.

58
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:16,173
Let me get this straight.

59
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:19,760
We just "Saved
the sodding world together,"

60
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,595
and you're
too good to drink with me?

61
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:22,980
Obviously.

62
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:25,432
And I doubt
that you have my brand.

63
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:27,568
What's your poison,
your highness?

64
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:30,604
Craig, aged 30 years, at least.

65
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:32,940
Been drinking it
since grade school.

66
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:34,608
Well...

67
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:37,778
I got old rotgut...

68
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,997
Aged six days.

69
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:43,483
Swill like that is gonna
burn a hole in your soul.

70
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:45,502
Oh, sorry.<i>My</i> soul.

71
00:02:45,587 --> 00:02:47,287
But that's why you called...

72
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:49,322
our little... deal?

73
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:51,041
Yeah, well...

74
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:53,844
it's about time
you hold up your end

75
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:55,012
and give it back.

76
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:56,380
Give it back?

77
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:58,465
Our deal was...

78
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:01,268
We ice Lucifer,
you rip up the lease.

79
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:02,469
Oh.

80
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:05,606
You didn't read your contract.

81
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:07,891
The hell you talking about, contract?

82
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:12,396
Paragraph 18, subsection "B."

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,865
Which is
on your naughty bits...

84
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:16,533
I only have to make
"best efforts"

85
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:17,851
to give you back your soul.

86
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:19,987
Meaning what?

87
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:22,156
Meaning...

88
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,324
I'd like to...

89
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,526
but I can't.

90
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:28,212
You lying sack of...

91
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:30,631
10 years...

92
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:32,766
you come to daddy.

93
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:35,969
Till then, I suggest you start
drinking the good stuff.

94
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:38,639
I figured you'd say that.

95
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:41,675
So you can rot here
until you change your mind.

96
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:44,211
- Why? 'Cause you asked nicely?
- No.

97
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:47,414
'Cause I'm going "Dateline"
on your ass.

98
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:51,902
I hope that's paint.

99
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:54,855
Really?

100
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:56,990
What am I going to do?

101
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:03,914
Doggy breath.

102
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:05,532
Bracing, isn't it?

103
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:09,086
Ball's in your court, Robert.

104
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,788
10 years of living...

105
00:04:10,872 --> 00:04:12,756
or 10 years as Alpo.

106
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:28,939
This ain't over.

107
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:30,974
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

108
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:38,598
Happy hunting.

109
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:56,248
 Season 6 Episode 4
"Weekend at Bobby's"

110
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,534
No EMF.

111
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:14,569
Find anything in there?

112
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,238
Yeah, I got some kind of a... claw

113
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,241
What in the hell
has a claw like that?

114
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:22,043
That is a good question.

115
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:33,555
Maybe he's in the can.

116
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,063
Yeah?

117
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:44,483
- What happened, you fall and can't get back up?
- Hilarious.

118
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,117
- What's up?
- We're in Wisconsin.

119
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:48,370
Six bodies,
chests cracked wide open.

120
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:50,438
No EMF, no sulfur,
no hex bags.

121
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,707
We did find this, though.
Hang on.

122
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:56,878
All right, check your wang.

123
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,250
That's a new one.

124
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,919
Yeah, we need an I.D. ASAP.

125
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,286
This thing's on a rampage.

126
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:07,222
Call as soon
as you dig something up.

127
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:08,557
Dean, I'm a little busy.

128
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:10,058
Well, then kick Bo Derek
out of your bathtub.

129
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,125
We got a case here.

130
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:13,311
I'll call you back.

131
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:21,135
Balls.

132
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:48,329
Balls!

133
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,802
Come on!

134
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:56,521
Come on!

135
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:02,444
Balls!

136
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:38,680
You're hunting a Lamia.

137
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:40,231
Come again?

138
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:41,549
It's a monster.

139
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,818
Juices hearts, chugs the blood.

140
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:46,721
Never heard of one popping up
outside of Greece, though.

141
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:48,740
Yeah, well, looks like
this freak has immigrated.

142
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:50,025
It's snacking
on cheese-heads.

143
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:51,159
How do we gank it?

144
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:54,412
There's a couple of ways.

145
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:57,449
Easiest is a silver knife
blessed by a padre.

146
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,167
Gotcha.

147
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:04,172
You're welcome.

148
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,844
Hey! I'm still here!

149
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,049
Hey, there, cranky.

150
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,768
You were gone so long,
I just assumed alcoholic coma.

151
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:21,473
- Where were we?
- Your soul.

152
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:22,440
Right.

153
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:23,625
Talk.

154
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:26,695
Look at you... all in a rush.

155
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:28,596
Foreplay...

156
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:30,782
gets you more play.

157
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,717
I want Crowley's name.

158
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:34,569
His <i>real</i> name,

159
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,004
back when he was flesh
and blood.

160
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:37,322
Does tying demons up
in your basement

161
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:38,957
make you feel better

162
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,976
about that time
you killed your wife?

163
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:52,387
What's that?

164
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:55,757
You don't recognize them?
They're yours.

165
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:16,695
It won't work.

166
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:17,829
It's a myth.

167
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:20,165
Then you got nothing
to worry about.

168
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:28,540
I can't!

169
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:31,876
You don't know
what he'll do to me.

170
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:33,712
- Right now, you better worry about me.
- You don't get it.

171
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:34,796
He's the king.

172
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:39,718
King of the crossroads,
I've heard the speech.

173
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:41,519
No.

174
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:43,421
King of hell.

175
00:09:52,014 --> 00:09:53,815
You gonna get that
or what?

176
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:09,848
Marcy.

177
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:12,884
- Bobby Singer, how long have we been neighbors?
- Six months.

178
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:14,803
Well, don't you think
it's time

179
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,205
you welcomed me
to the neighborhood?

180
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:20,091
My famous
ginger-peach cobbler.

181
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:22,677
Take a whiff.
Seriously, I'm a genius.

182
00:10:25,898 --> 00:10:29,267
Help me!
Somebody help me!

183
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,235
It's, um...

184
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:31,886
stupid horror flicks.

185
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:32,987
Guilty pleasure.

186
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:34,689
I love scary movies.

187
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,442
Hey, have you seen
"Drag Me to Hell"?

188
00:10:37,526 --> 00:10:39,327
Trying to avoid it.

189
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:41,229
But it's fantastic.

190
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,799
Saturday, 7:00, my house.

191
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:46,417
I'll fix you dinner,

192
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:48,753
and I'll whip up a batch of my
famous white-chocolate popcorn,

193
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:49,737
and we'll watch it.

194
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:52,240
Deal?

195
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,260
That sounds super, Marcy,
but, uh...

196
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:58,880
Okay, no worries.

197
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:00,598
Um, hey, one other thing...

198
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:04,085
uh, my wood chipper...
it's a piece of crap.

199
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:05,470
You know, it just
broke down on me,

200
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:07,138
and... and I hear
that you're quite handy.

201
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:11,526
Maybe you could come over
and... take a look.

202
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:13,427
You know, just whenever.

203
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,196
Yeah, I'll see
what I can do.

204
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,314
Okay.

205
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:22,620
Okay.

206
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:27,108
Okay, see you soon.

207
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:41,306
Aw! She sounds nice.

208
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,308
Are you gonna
make sweet love to her

209
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,476
before you stab
her to death, Bobby?

210
00:11:45,561 --> 00:11:46,978
That is your usual thing, right?

211
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,234
I want Crowley's name, <i>now!</i>

212
00:11:56,805 --> 00:11:58,740
- Crowley's name!
- Okay!

213
00:11:58,807 --> 00:11:59,774
Okay.

214
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:01,976
Macleod.

215
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:03,995
Fergus Macleod.
I swear.

216
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,947
We call him lucky the leprechaun
behind his back.

217
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:09,117
Macleod's Scottish, Einstein.

218
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:12,170
You got what you want.
Now send me back.

219
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:12,954
No.

220
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,958
We had a deal!

221
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:19,127
Gave it my best effort.

222
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:19,928
No!

223
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:37,433
Yeah, Garth. What do you got?

224
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:39,235
I've never heard of a vamp doing that.

225
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:41,204
Doesn't sound
like our kind of thing.

226
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:43,239
Better drop a dime to the FBI.

227
00:12:45,493 --> 00:12:47,210
Willis. FBI.

228
00:12:49,997 --> 00:12:54,450
No, Garth. Not <i>me,</i> the FBI.
The <i>real</i> FBI.

229
00:12:54,502 --> 00:12:56,720
How are you still alive?

230
00:12:58,472 --> 00:12:59,789
You got Castle.

231
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,757
Yeah.

232
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:01,975
Yeah.

233
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:03,226
Willis.

234
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:04,728
Uh-huh.

235
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:06,813
Of course she's one of ours.

236
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:08,264
And if she says
she's got to dig that grave up,

237
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:10,299
you better damn well let her.

238
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:13,436
Mm.

239
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:16,523
Oh, good, you're home.

240
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:19,307
Listen, you got to
help me bury a body.

241
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,062
Why'd you bring it here?

242
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,864
The law is on my tail.

243
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:26,166
What was your guess?

244
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,084
What? What? What?
They got lucky.

245
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:29,652
Yeah,
or you're getting slow.

246
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:31,154
I'm getting slow.

247
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:33,673
Yeah, says Mr. "sits on his ass
all day taking calls."

248
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:40,930
Vamp? Shifter? What?

249
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:42,332
None of the above.

250
00:13:44,385 --> 00:13:46,519
Okami?

251
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:47,854
Where'd you shiv it?

252
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:50,190
Get this... billings.

253
00:13:50,274 --> 00:13:52,725
Only time I ever saw
one of these was in Japan.

254
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,146
Duh! No one's ever seen
one of these except in Japan.

255
00:13:56,197 --> 00:13:57,847
For what it's worth,

256
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:01,517
Sam and Dean are tracking
a Lamia in Wisconsin.

257
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:04,821
Get out. I thought
they never leave Greece.

258
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:07,791
Monsters lately...

259
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:09,626
is it me, or is it weird?

260
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:12,361
Yeah, well, it's...
definitely something.

261
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:16,031
So, you got a shovel?

262
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,476
Man! I know what I want
for Hanukkah.

263
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,051
So, the son of a bitch's name
is Fergus Macleod?

264
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:36,769
That's the son of a bitch's name.

265
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:38,221
Where you gonna look?

266
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:40,657
Scotland.

267
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:43,026
Crowley let slip
that he likes Craig.

268
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:44,194
It's, um...

269
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,079
It's Scotch.

270
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:47,947
Only made and sold
in a tiny area

271
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:49,916
on the north tip
of Caithness County.

272
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,234
It's peaty and sharp

273
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:53,520
with a long finish
of citrus and tobacco notes.

274
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:58,424
Hey, what?
What am I, a heathen?

275
00:14:58,509 --> 00:14:59,509
I know what Craig is.

276
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:06,516
Well, I got a hunch that, that's
where Crowley lived and died,

277
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,518
back when he was a human...

278
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:11,254
a few hundred years before
he got the big squeeze in hell

279
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:13,272
and came out a demon.

280
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:17,426
You know, I got contacts
over there.

281
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:19,812
I can make a few calls.

282
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:21,814
I ain't asking
for no help.

283
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,200
I'm not asking
for your permission.

284
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:37,463
Yeah.

285
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:38,748
What's another way
to kill a Lamia?

286
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,216
Well, what happened
to the silver knife

287
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:42,984
- blessed by a priest?
- That didn't pan out.

288
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:45,554
What's plan "B"?

289
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:48,791
Police!

290
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:51,144
- Balls!
- Come on, Bobby, get the lead out.

291
00:15:51,228 --> 00:15:52,962
- Where are you?
- The church... in a rectory.

292
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:53,930
- Is there a kitchen?
- Yeah.

293
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:56,065
Find salt and rosemary.

294
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:57,600
Open up, Singer!

295
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:01,688
Mr. Singer, I'm Agent Adams.

296
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:03,489
I believe you know Sheriff Mills.

297
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:06,159
Come on.

298
00:16:06,277 --> 00:16:08,278
My mom. Just a second.

299
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:11,114
- Rosemary! I got it!
- Great, great.

300
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:14,918
Now blend the herbs,
saut? over a high heat.

301
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:16,336
Cook well.

302
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:24,344
Sammy! Fire in the hole!

303
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:29,165
Okay, great, great.

304
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:31,000
Enjoy the roast, mom.

305
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:32,468
Have you seen this man?

306
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,604
Rufus Turner,
aka Luther Vandross,

307
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:36,773
aka Ruben Studdard?

308
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,509
- No. Never seen that dick.
- How you know he's a dick?

309
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:43,545
- Lucky guess.
- Funny.

310
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:45,431
'Cause I got a couple guys
working the highway,

311
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:47,166
said they saw him pull in here,
carrying a body.

312
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:48,451
Well, that's ridiculous.

313
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:50,370
Look, it's a work day.
I got to...

314
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:51,654
We just want
to take a look around.

315
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:57,360
You got a warrant, Sonny?

316
00:16:57,411 --> 00:17:00,380
Well, do I need one... Sir?

317
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:05,635
Okay, fellas,
put the rulers away. Zip up.

318
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:08,388
Look, Bobby here's
kind of a...

319
00:17:08,472 --> 00:17:09,806
Crank.

320
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:11,975
And he ain't what you call
a fan of Big Brother.

321
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:13,309
But me and him...

322
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:15,812
how long I been
arresting you now, 10 years?

323
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:17,680
- Thereabouts.
- Yeah, we got a history.

324
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:20,549
So, what do you say you just
let me scope the place out?

325
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,352
That okay?
You can just wait outside.

326
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:26,889
Five minutes.

327
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,991
Great.

328
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:35,832
Why'd you send him
outside?

329
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:37,917
'Cause I didn't think
you'd want him in here.

330
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:40,253
- I don't. I've got a body in the basement.
- My point.

331
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:42,422
Yeah, but I've got another body
buried in the yard.

332
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:44,707
Damn it.

333
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:50,346
He's not there.

334
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:52,431
Balls.

335
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:57,586
Mr. Singer,
come with me please.

336
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:17,373
You mind explaining this?

337
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:20,960
What, you never had
a septic tank explode on you?

338
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:24,745
I got it pretty well cleaned up,
but watch where you step.

339
00:18:27,384 --> 00:18:28,617
Get back here.

340
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:30,786
Get back... I'm two states
over, Bobby. I can't...

341
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:32,422
The okami ain't dead.

342
00:18:32,473 --> 00:18:33,756
Of course it is.

343
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:35,975
- Did you use a bamboo dagger?
- Yeah.

344
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,727
Blessed by a Shinto priest?

345
00:18:37,794 --> 00:18:39,462
I'm not an imbecile, Bobby.

346
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:40,763
Did you stab it seven times?

347
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:42,565
Five times.

348
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:44,817
It's seven.

349
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:46,986
No, I'm pretty sure
it's five.

350
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:48,637
Well, clearly
it's seven times.

351
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:50,573
The damn hole is empty.

352
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,358
What was it feeding on
when you found it?

353
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,160
Single, white females...

354
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:55,661
While they slept.

355
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:25,691
Aah!

356
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:27,510
Bobby? Where's your bedroom?

357
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:40,289
Bobby, I am trying
to keep my cool here.

358
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:43,209
What are you doing in my house
with a shotgun?

359
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:46,796
Have you see anything... weird?

360
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:49,365
You mean besides you?

361
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:29,872
Bobby! No!

362
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:31,574
Look out!

363
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:54,263
I, uh...

364
00:20:54,314 --> 00:20:56,232
I thought
your chipper was broke.

365
00:21:00,237 --> 00:21:03,272
I just said that
to get you over here.

366
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:06,959
Oh.

367
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:10,162
Well...

368
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:13,749
I guess I could come over
for dinner some night.

369
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,084
Might be fun.

370
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,087
I don't think so.

371
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:23,893
Story of my life.

372
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:27,953
Your still alive, huh?

373
00:21:28,018 --> 00:21:29,539
Don't act so surprised.

374
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:32,428
- How about Godzilla?
- Put her down.

375
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:34,580
So, you just happened
to have a bamboo dagger

376
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:36,448
blessed by a Shinto priest
laying around?

377
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:37,583
Wood chipper.

378
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:39,735
Oh, okeydokey.
Wood chipper.

379
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:42,654
That... that pretty much
trumps... everything.

380
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:46,759
Listen, uh, Bobby, um...

381
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:48,210
Thank you.

382
00:21:48,261 --> 00:21:50,012
I screwed up.

383
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,463
Forget it.

384
00:21:51,548 --> 00:21:54,299
I figure I still owe you
more than you owe me.

385
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:57,102
All righty. Then add
one more thing to the list.

386
00:21:57,187 --> 00:21:59,238
I got a lead
on your boy Crowley...

387
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:05,694
aka Fergus Rodric Macleod.

388
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,597
Born in Canisbay, Scotland,
1661.

389
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:12,100
Great. I don't know
what that's gonna get me.

390
00:22:12,152 --> 00:22:15,070
All right. Well, then, behind
door number two, Bob...

391
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:17,239
Crowley had a son.

392
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,374
Did he, now?

393
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:20,209
Yeah, name of Gavin.

394
00:22:20,276 --> 00:22:22,244
Moved across the pond
after his parents bit it

395
00:22:22,295 --> 00:22:23,579
and captained
a trading ship

396
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,081
that went down
in Massachusetts in 1723.

397
00:22:26,132 --> 00:22:27,499
A couple of Cousteau
wannabes found the wreck

398
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,584
about 30 years ago.

399
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:30,586
- They fish out his bones?
- No, no.

400
00:22:30,637 --> 00:22:32,971
They did find his
signet ring, though.

401
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:35,557
It's part of the "Treasures
From the Deep" exhibit

402
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,309
at the Maritime Museum
in Andover.

403
00:22:37,394 --> 00:22:38,844
I need that ring.

404
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:40,562
Ooh!

405
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,732
Oh, are you, um...
you asking for my help, Bob?

406
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:48,303
Bobby?

407
00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:50,656
I'm asking for a ring.

408
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,576
And... I'd appreciate your...

409
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:56,528
help getting it.

410
00:22:56,613 --> 00:22:58,914
I'm way ahead of you, brother.

411
00:22:58,981 --> 00:23:00,082
I'm headed for Andover now.

412
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:01,333
I should be there
around midnight.

413
00:23:01,418 --> 00:23:04,169
You're, um...

414
00:23:04,254 --> 00:23:06,488
you're thinking
hostage exchange, aren't you?

415
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:09,875
I mean, get the ring,
you can summon junior's ghost.

416
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:13,796
Get the ghost, you can swap
Crowley his son for your soul.

417
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:16,632
Something like that.

418
00:23:16,683 --> 00:23:19,334
Let's hope that works out.

419
00:23:42,358 --> 00:23:44,042
Dean, you all right?

420
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:48,130
Yeah.
Yeah, the Lamia grilled up fine.

421
00:23:48,197 --> 00:23:51,533
I sense a "but" coming on.

422
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:53,252
It's Sam, Bobby.

423
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,257
He's just... he's different.

424
00:23:58,324 --> 00:23:59,892
You know, and I get it.

425
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:01,343
You go through something like that,

426
00:24:01,411 --> 00:24:03,262
and... and you change.

427
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:04,396
But...

428
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:07,516
Something's not right to me.

429
00:24:09,552 --> 00:24:12,070
- Dean...
- I've got a few questions about that year.

430
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:14,189
- When you saw him and I didn't.
- Dean, I got another call.

431
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,691
- You what?
- Just hang on.

432
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,943
I got to take this.
It's important.

433
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:20,445
More important than Sam?

434
00:24:21,814 --> 00:24:22,898
Bobby?

435
00:24:22,949 --> 00:24:24,333
Rufus?

436
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,668
The good news is I snagged
the ring, Bobby. However...

437
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:29,338
- Tell me that ain't...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

438
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:32,407
Three guesses, and one of 'em...
it ain't the paramedics.

439
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,844
- Listen, Bobby, I-I got to stash this ring.
- But don't swallow it.

440
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:38,013
Right. I'm swallowing it, Bobby.

441
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,798
Don't swallow it.

442
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:43,969
Ahh!

443
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:46,104
Damn it.

444
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:47,556
Aw, hell!

445
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:49,441
Get on
the ground! Out of the car!

446
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:51,777
I know my rights, damn it!

447
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:54,029
That is unnecessary force.

448
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,366
You still there, Dean?

449
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:58,650
Bobby, what the hell?

450
00:24:58,735 --> 00:25:00,953
I-I'm sorry.

451
00:25:02,572 --> 00:25:04,289
You know, you are the one person

452
00:25:04,374 --> 00:25:06,274
that I can talk to
about this stuff...

453
00:25:06,326 --> 00:25:09,394
about... about Sam,
about leaving Lisa and Ben.

454
00:25:09,462 --> 00:25:11,663
I mean, I don't... I don't even
know which way is up right now.

455
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:16,351
Bobby?

456
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:17,636
Hello?

457
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,672
I-I hear you, son.
I-it just ain't a good time.

458
00:25:20,757 --> 00:25:21,723
Yeah, okay.
You know what?

459
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,058
Forget it.

460
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:26,628
I mean, I'm baring my soul
like a freaking girl here,

461
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:28,680
and, uh...
and you've got stuff to do.

462
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:30,349
Well, that is... that's fine.

463
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:33,485
That's fine, but seriously,
though... a little selfish.

464
00:25:33,553 --> 00:25:35,654
Not all about you.

465
00:25:38,508 --> 00:25:39,808
Where's your brother?

466
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:41,910
Outside.

467
00:25:41,978 --> 00:25:43,161
Get him.

468
00:25:44,998 --> 00:25:46,949
You're on speaker, Bobby.

469
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,150
Sam? Dean?

470
00:25:49,202 --> 00:25:52,320
I love you like my own.
I do.

471
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:53,989
But sometimes...

472
00:25:59,262 --> 00:26:00,629
sometimes,

473
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,015
you two are the whiniest,

474
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:06,935
most self-absorbed
sons of bitches I ever met.

475
00:26:07,003 --> 00:26:08,604
<i>I'm</i> selfish?

476
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:09,972
<i>Me?</i>

477
00:26:10,023 --> 00:26:13,008
I do everything for you... everything!

478
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:15,427
You need some lore scrounged up?

479
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:17,980
You need your asses
pulled out of the fire?

480
00:26:18,031 --> 00:26:21,199
You need someone to bitch to
about each other?

481
00:26:21,284 --> 00:26:24,019
You call me,
and I come through...

482
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,371
every... damn... time.

483
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:28,123
And what do I get for it?

484
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,459
Jack with a side of squat!

485
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:33,829
- Bobby...
- Do I sound like I'm done?

486
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,049
Now, look, I know
you've got issues.

487
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:40,335
God knows I know.

488
00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:42,704
But I got a news flash for you.

489
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:45,590
You ain't the center
of the universe.

490
00:26:45,658 --> 00:26:47,509
Now, it may have
slipped your mind

491
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,595
that Crowley owns my soul

492
00:26:50,713 --> 00:26:52,180
and the meter is running!

493
00:26:52,248 --> 00:26:55,984
And I will be damned
if I am gonna sit around

494
00:26:56,052 --> 00:26:58,737
and... and be damned!

495
00:26:58,821 --> 00:27:02,441
So, how about you two sack up

496
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:04,826
and help <i>me</i> for once?!

497
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:10,415
Bobby, all...
all you got to do is ask.

498
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,953
Anything you need, we're there.

499
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:30,686
Hey!

500
00:27:32,221 --> 00:27:33,605
Got a call
from Marcy Ward.

501
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,158
Seems she had
a little home invasion.

502
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:38,610
Told her I'd look into it.
Didn't bother filing a report.

503
00:27:38,695 --> 00:27:40,645
Thanks.

504
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,930
Need a favor.

505
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:43,782
Luther Vandross turn up?

506
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:46,151
Tell him I'm a fan.

507
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:48,103
His real name's
Rufus Turner.

508
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:50,122
He's being held
in Andover, Mass.,

509
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:51,540
on a burglary charge.

510
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:53,709
Need you to get him
extradited here.

511
00:27:53,776 --> 00:27:55,043
Extradited for what?

512
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:56,378
Murder.

513
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,514
You're not joking.

514
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,219
Do you have any idea what it
takes to extradite a prisoner?

515
00:28:04,286 --> 00:28:06,588
I'd need a court order,
permission from the D.A.

516
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:09,007
I-I would have to call in
every marker I got

517
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:11,143
and hand out a few to boot.

518
00:28:11,227 --> 00:28:13,178
So, you're saying
there's a chance.

519
00:28:13,262 --> 00:28:14,963
And if by some miracle we <i>can</i>
<i>get him here, then what?</i>

520
00:28:15,014 --> 00:28:16,398
Then your pal's here
on a murder charge.

521
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:18,066
How you gonna to get him out
from under that one?

522
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:19,885
Let me handle
the "B" side.

523
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:25,907
I like you, Bobby,

524
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:27,359
but this could nuke my career.

525
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:30,645
Look, I've done a lot
for this town...

526
00:28:30,696 --> 00:28:35,033
some you know about,
some you don't.

527
00:28:35,118 --> 00:28:38,453
And I'm not real good at this
whole "asking for help" thing,

528
00:28:38,504 --> 00:28:40,689
but...

529
00:28:40,757 --> 00:28:44,092
I'm sorry, Bobby. I can't.

530
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:11,519
Miss me?

531
00:29:14,523 --> 00:29:16,892
- How did you...
- Don't ask.

532
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,461
You got one hour,
and then I call the Feds

533
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:21,296
and tell them he busted out.

534
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:22,831
Thanks.

535
00:29:22,882 --> 00:29:25,250
I lose my job over this,
I am taking it out of your ass.

536
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,874
Tell me the ring is still
in your stomach.

537
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:42,566
I'll go boil some water.

538
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:44,669
What?

539
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:04,080
<i>Amate spiritus obscure...</i>

540
00:30:04,131 --> 00:30:06,466
<i>Te quaerimus.</i>

541
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:11,254
<i>Oramus nobiscum colloquere...</i>

542
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:16,459
<i>Apud nos circita.</i>

543
00:30:38,832 --> 00:30:39,832
Gavin Macleod?

544
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,285
Is...

545
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:44,003
is this hell?

546
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:46,688
That's gonna depend on you.

547
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:49,375
Are you
Fergus Macleod's boy?

548
00:30:51,362 --> 00:30:54,130
You and me...

549
00:30:54,181 --> 00:30:57,433
are gonna have
a nice, long chat.

550
00:31:21,775 --> 00:31:24,260
Well, you look like hammered crap.

551
00:31:24,328 --> 00:31:25,778
And you're a vision, as always.

552
00:31:30,134 --> 00:31:32,218
Don't we both know
how this game ends?

553
00:31:32,302 --> 00:31:33,720
Really, Bobby...

554
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:35,304
you got to know
when to fold 'em.

555
00:31:35,372 --> 00:31:36,556
Word on the street is,

556
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,207
that ever since Lucifer
went to the pokey,

557
00:31:38,258 --> 00:31:40,677
you're the big kahuna downstairs.

558
00:31:40,728 --> 00:31:43,262
- I see you've been reading The Trades.
- Trouble in paradise?

559
00:31:43,347 --> 00:31:46,215
Mate, you have no idea.

560
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:50,553
I thought...

561
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,572
That when I got
the corner office...

562
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:54,390
I thought
it was all gonna be...

563
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:57,243
rainbows and two headed puppies.

564
00:31:57,327 --> 00:31:59,495
But if I'm being honest...

565
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:01,814
it's been hell.

566
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:03,232
Thought that was the point.

567
00:32:06,036 --> 00:32:08,671
You know what the problem
with demons is?

568
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:10,490
- They're demons?
- Exactly.

569
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:13,710
Evil, lying prats,
the whole lot of them.

570
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:15,094
And stupid.

571
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,965
Try to show them a-a new way...
a better way...

572
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:20,683
and what do you get?

573
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:21,884
Bugger all!

574
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:24,771
You know, there's days that I think

575
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:28,891
Lucifer's whole "spike anything
with black eyes" plan

576
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:31,127
wasn't half bad.

577
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:35,264
Feels good to get that
off my chest.

578
00:32:35,315 --> 00:32:36,766
We should make this
a thing.

579
00:32:36,817 --> 00:32:38,868
Do I look like Dr. Phil
to you?

580
00:32:38,936 --> 00:32:41,186
A little.

581
00:32:41,822 --> 00:32:43,623
Anyhoo...

582
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:46,125
Obviously not here
for a social call,

583
00:32:46,193 --> 00:32:47,577
so on with it.

584
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:48,611
I want...

585
00:32:48,662 --> 00:32:49,579
Ah.

586
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,813
I'll save you the recap.

587
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:52,882
In fact, I'll do
the shorthand for you.

588
00:32:52,949 --> 00:32:56,886
I want my soul back, idjit!

589
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:58,504
Afraid not.

590
00:32:58,589 --> 00:33:00,473
But
I'm surly, and I got a beard!

591
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:02,291
Gimme!

592
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:03,509
Blah, blah, blah,

593
00:33:03,594 --> 00:33:05,762
homespun, cornpone insult,

594
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:07,930
witty retort from yours truly.

595
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:10,967
The bottom line is...
you get bubkes.

596
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:12,134
Are we done?

597
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:14,303
Just getting started.

598
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:23,678
Gavin?

599
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:26,364
Is that you?

600
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,368
I-it's... it's been so long.

601
00:33:31,655 --> 00:33:34,040
I love you so...

602
00:33:38,128 --> 00:33:39,762
Sorry.

603
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,014
Your soul for my boy...
that's it, right?

604
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:43,966
I got to give you credit

605
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:46,219
for thinking outside the box
on that one,

606
00:33:46,286 --> 00:33:48,521
but problem is,
I loathe the little bastard.

607
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:49,806
You want to torture him?

608
00:33:49,857 --> 00:33:51,674
Just let me pull up a chair,
and I'll watch.

609
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,593
Hell, burn his bones,
send him down to me.

610
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,861
We can have
a family reunion.

611
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:56,429
That's right, son?

612
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:58,614
You picked the wrong bargaining
chip this time, my friend.

613
00:33:58,682 --> 00:34:00,399
He ain't a chip.

614
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:05,271
I was just using him
to dig up dirt on you.

615
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:08,574
And since Gavin hates you

616
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,960
maybe even more
than you hate him,

617
00:34:11,027 --> 00:34:15,364
he was more than happy
to squawk.

618
00:34:15,415 --> 00:34:17,032
What did you
tell him, son?

619
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:20,569
Everything.

620
00:34:29,062 --> 00:34:31,430
I know it all now...

621
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:33,799
Fergus.

622
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:38,321
Now, you may be
king of the dirt-bags here,

623
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:42,608
but in life, you were nothing
but a two-bit tailor

624
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:45,111
who sold his soul

625
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:48,080
in exchange for an extra
3 inches below the belt.

626
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:50,433
Just trying
to hit double digits.

627
00:34:52,286 --> 00:34:53,870
So...

628
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:55,555
you got a glimpse
behind the curtain.

629
00:34:55,622 --> 00:34:56,589
And?

630
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:58,040
And...

631
00:34:58,091 --> 00:35:00,626
Now I know
where you're planted.

632
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:09,936
Hiya, Crowley.

633
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,970
Dean.

634
00:35:11,054 --> 00:35:12,939
It's been a long time.

635
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:14,891
- We should get together.
- Sure.

636
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:17,126
We'll have to do that
when I get back.

637
00:35:17,194 --> 00:35:19,727
- Back?
- Yeah.

638
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,398
Me and Sam...
we've gone international.

639
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:24,951
In fact, we're in
your neck of the woods.

640
00:35:27,204 --> 00:35:28,771
Did you really
used to wear a skirt?

641
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,123
A kilt.

642
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,825
I had very athletic calves.

643
00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:35,995
- What's the game?
- Dominoes.

644
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,914
In fact,
we just dug yours up.

645
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,084
This is ridiculous.

646
00:35:42,135 --> 00:35:44,170
The whole burning-bones thing...
I-it's a myth.

647
00:35:44,254 --> 00:35:46,973
I know an employee
of yours who'd disagree.

648
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,290
What's that?

649
00:35:48,342 --> 00:35:51,477
You don't recognize 'em?
They're yours.

650
00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:10,162
That's where she got to.

651
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:11,647
You demons.

652
00:36:11,698 --> 00:36:14,216
You think
you're something special,

653
00:36:14,284 --> 00:36:16,819
but you're just spirits.

654
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,455
Twisted, perverted,
evil spirits,

655
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:22,008
but end of the day,

656
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:25,094
you're nothing but ghosts
with an ego.

657
00:36:27,347 --> 00:36:31,984
We torch your bones,
you go up in flames.

658
00:36:32,052 --> 00:36:34,286
You hear that, Crowley?

659
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:36,789
That's me flicking my bic
for you.

660
00:36:36,857 --> 00:36:40,142
Your bones for my soul.

661
00:36:40,193 --> 00:36:41,494
Going once.

662
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,284
Going twice.

663
00:36:53,824 --> 00:36:55,691
Bollocks!

664
00:37:06,003 --> 00:37:10,505
You can go ahead and leave in
the part about my legs.

665
00:37:17,547 --> 00:37:20,599
Pleasure doing business with you.

666
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:22,785
Now, if you don't mind...

667
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:32,361
I believe those are mine.

668
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:34,864
You know, now that
I think about it,

669
00:37:34,915 --> 00:37:36,665
maybe I'll just...

670
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:37,950
...napalm your ass anyhow.

671
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:39,368
Dean...

672
00:37:39,436 --> 00:37:41,704
he's a Dick...

673
00:37:41,772 --> 00:37:43,089
but a deal's a deal.

674
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:46,208
I don't need you to fight
my battles for me, moose.

675
00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:47,242
Get bent.

676
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,725
Now, if you'll excuse me...

677
00:38:02,776 --> 00:38:05,094
I have a little hell to raise.

678
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,765
<i>I appreciate you
boys lending a hand</i>

679
00:38:20,946 --> 00:38:23,164
Hey, anytime we get
to punk Crowley works for us.

680
00:38:23,364 --> 00:38:25,270
Yeah.

681
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:27,707
Still, knowing how much you love
flying the friendly skies.

682
00:38:27,774 --> 00:38:30,776
I guess a 9-hour plane trip
was no picnic.

683
00:38:30,827 --> 00:38:32,044
What'd you do,
drink your way through it?

684
00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:33,462
I was fine.

685
00:38:33,547 --> 00:38:35,998
No, he white-knuckled his way
through four puke bags.

686
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,300
Well, at least I was sober.

687
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:39,719
Some nut-job decided to try
something, I was ready.

688
00:38:39,786 --> 00:38:40,753
I had a fork.

689
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:46,809
Listen, um...

690
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:49,095
About the things
I said earlier...

691
00:38:49,146 --> 00:38:51,847
- I was in a tough spot, and I-I guess I was...
- You were right, Bobby.

692
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:53,182
We take you for granted.

693
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:55,268
You've been cleaning up
our messes for years, Bobby.

694
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:59,104
Without you, I don't even want to think about
where me and Sam would have ended up.

695
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:06,946
Okay, then. Let's roll credits
on this chick flick.

696
00:39:06,997 --> 00:39:08,447
You boys have a safe flight.

697
00:39:08,498 --> 00:39:10,983
And, uh, try some
of the local grub.

698
00:39:11,034 --> 00:39:12,702
I hear it's... exotic.

699
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:14,287
Oh, yeah, no, definitely,
we are.

700
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:15,621
I hear they have
an olive garden.

701
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:44,533
Willis.

702
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:49,372
Yeah, he is.
One of our best agents, in fact.
