00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:12,163
<i>This thing goes our way</i>

2
00:00:12,247 --> 00:00:13,998
<i>and I... Triple lindy</i>
<i>into that box...</i>

3
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:17,835
<i>...you know</i>
<i>I'm not coming back.</i>

4
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:27,094
<i>You got to promise</i>
<i>not to try to bring me back.</i>

5
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:28,495
<i>You go find Lisa.</i>

6
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:32,099
<i>You go live</i>
<i>some normal, apple-pie life.</i>

7
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,101
<i>Promise me, Dean.</i>

8
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:36,303
<i>Promise me.</i>

9
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:57,241
you okay?

10
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,692
Yeah, I'm good.

And thank God
this is before facebook, right?

14
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:26,523
Because it'd be me and that goat...

15
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:27,775
...all over the Internet.

16
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,026
- That's right.
- So...

17
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,028
Don't get me wrong, right?
No complaints.

18
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:32,646
But if you'd have said
to me,

19
00:03:32,697 --> 00:03:34,948
"Hey, you...
15 years from now?

20
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,016
Suburbia."

21
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,818
- Oh, yeah.
- Right?

22
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,703
Believe me, I know.

23
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:41,372
So, you've traveled around
a lot, huh?

24
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:42,489
Mm-hmm.

25
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,041
Yeah, my whole life,
pretty much.

26
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:48,545
And?

27
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:51,165
I don't know.

28
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:52,532
Come on.

29
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:56,003
You... what, you moved in,
what, about a year ago?

30
00:03:56,054 --> 00:03:57,554
Yeah, thereabouts.

31
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,475
So I been buying you beer
for a year.

32
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,078
And I think that means you
owe me a couple of gory details.

33
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:06,063
Oh, no. There's not much
to tell, you know?

34
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:07,381
It's, uh...

35
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:10,517
I lived on the road...

36
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:14,071
Took, uh, crap jobs
that nobody else wanted.

37
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:15,022
Like?

38
00:04:15,073 --> 00:04:17,891
Like...

39
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:19,109
Pest control.

40
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:21,495
Really?

41
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,996
Pest control.

42
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:24,398
Yeah.

43
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,400
You get to work
with a partner.

44
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:29,169
You get to help people.

45
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:33,073
You have no idea
what's in some people's walls.

46
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:34,508
It could eat 'em alive.

47
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:36,994
Yeesh.

48
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:39,713
'Course, that was then and now...

49
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:41,932
You're practically respectable.

50
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,767
Yeah. Wow.

51
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:45,519
I guess so.

52
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,388
That's kind of Scary, actually.

53
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,305
Thanks, guys.

54
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,608
Thank <i>you.</i>

55
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,143
I think she likes you.

56
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:54,144
You think?

57
00:04:57,982 --> 00:04:59,650
What is it with <i>you?!</i>

58
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:02,269
Like, every time!

59
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,707
It's like chicks specifically
dig unavailable guys.

60
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:07,791
Who knew?

61
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,997
Okay.

62
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:15,299
I will see you
tomorrow.

63
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:16,717
I'll see you tomorrow.

64
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,419
Thanks, man.

65
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,748
And no one's called
about a missing person?

66
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:45,023
No, this would have
been today.

67
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:48,560
So no reports of anything
around Vineland and Oak street,

68
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:50,445
near that hotel renovation?

69
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:56,034
Uh, call it a hunch.

70
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:59,287
I've been a cop
for a long time.

71
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:04,075
Okay, yeah.
No, I'll call you tomorrow.

72
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,545
You too, man. Bye.

73
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:09,047
Hey.

74
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:11,199
Who was that?

75
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,367
Sid.

76
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:14,536
I'm just setting up
a poker game.

77
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:15,637
It's 11:30.

78
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,907
Is it really?

79
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:20,992
Well, that explains why
he was asleep when I called.

80
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:23,895
I'll be right up.

81
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,332
Okay.

82
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,828
Dean! Is that a gun?

83
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,964
No, no. Yeah.

84
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:25,350
Well, it's...
I got a permit for it.

85
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:28,219
What, to shoot
the Glickmans' dog?

86
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:32,307
I thought
that was a possum.

87
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:35,477
Remember when I said
I was in pest control?

88
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:38,179
Well, possums
carry rabies, so...

89
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:41,733
I did not know that.

90
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:42,984
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

91
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:44,486
Possums...

92
00:10:44,537 --> 00:10:46,721
possums kill, Sid.

93
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,291
Oh, crap.

94
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,959
What's that?

95
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:59,534
Sulfur.

96
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:00,919
- I got to go.
- Hold on, Dean!

97
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:02,754
What the hell?

98
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:31,583
Hey.

99
00:11:32,835 --> 00:11:34,285
Just getting a hammer.

100
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:38,340
So, I just
ran into Sid.

101
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:42,677
Did you almost
shoot a Yorkie?

102
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:45,347
Technically.

103
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,631
What's going on?

104
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:47,999
Nothing.

105
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:49,684
How come
I don't believe you?

106
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:54,105
I just... I, uh,
I-I got this...

107
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,141
I don't know,
spidey sense.

108
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:57,392
Okay.

109
00:11:57,443 --> 00:11:59,060
Are you hunting something?

110
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:00,261
Honestly?

111
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:03,931
Uh, at first,
I thought that I was.

112
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:08,069
But I'm pretty sure that
I got worked up over nothing.

113
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,621
It's, uh, you know...

114
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:12,240
it happens.

115
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:14,576
Are you sure?

116
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,414
I'll tell you what...

117
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:21,583
just because, you know,
I have an OCD thing about this,

118
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:24,085
why don't, uh, why don't
you and Ben go to the movies,

119
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:25,804
hit the cheesecake factory...

120
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:28,256
you know, hang out
with the teeming masses,

121
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:32,510
and I'll do one last sweep
just to be 100%.

122
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:36,464
Okay.

123
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:37,816
Be careful.

124
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,150
Careful's my middle name.

125
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,881
Hiya, Dean.

126
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:01,599
Look what the apocalypse
shook loose.

127
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,356
You have fun
sniffing that trail?

128
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:11,326
'Cause I sure had fun
patting you around.

129
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,694
You can't be...

130
00:14:12,745 --> 00:14:14,195
Oh, sure I can!

131
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:16,230
- No.
- Yeah, kiddo.

132
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:18,867
The big daddy brought your pal
Cass back, right?

133
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:20,869
So why not <i>me?</i>

134
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,122
Add a little Spice
to all that... that sugar.

135
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:30,929
Really?

136
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:32,931
After all we've been through
together?

137
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,519
You know, you got
a great little life here.

138
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:40,305
Pretty Lady... real understanding.

139
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:42,440
Hell of a kid.

140
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:45,610
And how do you
keep your lawn so green?

141
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:47,195
I mean, come on, Dean.

142
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,531
You never been
what I'd call brainy,

143
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,199
but did you really think

144
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,651
you were gonna
get to keep all of this?

145
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:56,487
You had to know that we were
coming for you sometime, pal.

146
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:03,711
You can't
outrun your past.

147
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:29,104
Hey, Dean.

148
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:37,166
I was expecting, uh...

149
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:39,835
I don't know, a hug,

150
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:42,104
some Holy water in the face...
something.

151
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,890
So I'm dead?

152
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:48,094
This is heaven?

153
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:50,029
Yellow eyes killed me,
and now...

154
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:52,064
yellow eyes?
That's what you saw?

155
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:53,582
"Saw"?

156
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,568
You were poisoned.

157
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:57,753
So whatever kind of crazy crap you
think you been seeing, it's not real.

158
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,330
So, then,
are you still... real?

159
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:09,749
- Or... or am I still...
- <i>I'm</i> real.

160
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:14,787
Here, let me
save you the trouble.

161
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:39,612
All me.

162
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,363
That's nasty.

163
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:53,108
Sammy?

164
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,877
Yeah.

165
00:16:54,944 --> 00:16:56,178
It's me.

166
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,316
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

167
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,018
You... you... you were...
you were gone, man.

168
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:20,236
I mean, that... that was it.

169
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:21,854
- How the hell are you...
- I don't know.

170
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:23,155
What do you mean,
you don't know?

171
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,473
I mean, no idea.

172
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:25,807
I... I'm just back.

173
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,409
Well, was it God,
or... or... or Cass?

174
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:29,078
I mean, does Cass
know anything about it?

175
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:30,446
You tell me.
I've been calling.

176
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:31,813
Cass hasn't answered
my prayers.

177
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,165
I don't even know
where he is.

178
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,817
I mean, I was... down there

179
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:37,703
and then, next minute,
it's raining

180
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:39,371
and I'm lying
in that field, alone.

181
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:43,042
It's kind of hard to go looking
for whatever saved you

182
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,510
when you got no leads.

183
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:45,994
But I looked.

184
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:48,881
I mean,
believe me, I looked...

185
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,182
For weeks.

186
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:56,889
Wait, weeks?

187
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,791
How long you been back?

188
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:02,745
How long
you been back, Sam?

189
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:04,280
About a year.

190
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:06,398
- About a year?
- Dean...

191
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:09,151
You been back
practically this whole time?!

192
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:12,171
What, did you lose the ability to
send a friggin' text message?!

193
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,739
You finally had
what you wanted, Dean.

194
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:16,659
- I wanted my <i>brother,</i> alive.
- You wanted a family.

195
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,461
You have for a long time, maybe
the whole time. I know you.

196
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:22,248
You only gave it up
because of the way we lived.

197
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,717
But you had something,
and you were <i>building</i> something.

198
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:27,002
Had I shown up, Dean,

199
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:29,805
you would have
just run off.

200
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:32,541
I'm sorry.

201
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:34,843
But it felt like
after everything,

202
00:18:34,895 --> 00:18:36,845
you deserved
some regular life.

203
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:46,906
What have you been doing?

204
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,440
Hunting.

205
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:53,462
You left me alone,
and you were flying solo?

206
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,164
Not solo.

207
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:56,999
- What?
- I hooked up with some other people.

208
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:58,417
You?
Working with strangers?

209
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,569
They're more like family.

210
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:02,004
And they're here.

211
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:20,806
Hey.

212
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:23,925
Hi.

213
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:27,279
My God, you have
delicate features for a hunter.

214
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:28,647
Excuse me?

215
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,149
Dean, Gwen Campbell.

216
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:32,534
Good to finally meet you.
Sam's gone on and on.

217
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:33,902
And this is Christian...

218
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:37,456
...and Mark.

219
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,290
Campbell.

220
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,293
Hi.

221
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:44,296
Cam... Campbell?
Like...

222
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:45,347
Like your mom?

223
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,668
Third cousin.
Third cousin.

224
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,837
Something, something
twice removed.

225
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:54,623
They grew up in the life,
like mom and like us.

226
00:19:54,674 --> 00:19:57,760
I thought all of mom's relatives
were gone.

227
00:19:59,262 --> 00:20:01,046
And I'm sorry.

228
00:20:01,114 --> 00:20:04,066
It's just, you know, why didn't
we know about <i>any</i> of you?

229
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,934
'Cause they didn't
know about you.

230
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:11,940
Not until
I brought you all together.

231
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:14,471
Samuel?

232
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,247
I'm your grandfather.

233
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:30,460
Guys, give me a second
with my grandsons here, please.

234
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:41,772
Lot of resurrections
in your face today.

235
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,140
It's all right, take a minute.

236
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:45,726
It's gonna take
a little more than a minute.

237
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,060
I mean, what the hell?

238
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,478
H-how did this happen?

239
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:51,815
We're guessing whatever
pulled Sam up pulled me down.

240
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:53,951
So, whatever this is,
we're both a part of it.

241
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,202
But you don't know
what that is.

242
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,320
Bingo.

243
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:59,022
And you have no leads?

244
00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:01,375
Nothing?

245
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,210
Well, this...
this is, uh...

246
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:09,333
No more doornail's coming out
of that door, is there?

247
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:10,834
As far as we know,
it's Samuel, and it's me.

248
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:16,039
Okay, am I the only one here

249
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,809
that... that... that thinks that
this can't all just be fine?

250
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:20,110
Believe me, you're not.

251
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,214
I wanted to come get you,
of course.

252
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:27,184
Sam was adamant about
leaving you out, so we did.

253
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:29,086
Until this.

254
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:31,554
Right.

255
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,907
So, then you ended up
in my garage how?

256
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:36,660
I got hit before you did,
few days ago.

257
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:38,228
Dosed up with poison.

258
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,947
- By?
- Couple of Djinn.

259
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:41,498
Djinn?

260
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:44,034
I thought those were...
were cave-dwelling hermit-type.

261
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:45,202
That's pretty exotic.

262
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:46,370
Not anymore, at least.

263
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:47,671
These... look like regular people.

264
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:48,589
They can blend in.

265
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:50,091
And all they got to do
to kill you is touch you.

266
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,876
Their toxins
get in your system,

267
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:54,462
all of a sudden you're
hallucinating your worst nightmares

268
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,730
and pretty soon you O.D.

269
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:57,381
Well, then how are you
breathing air?

270
00:21:57,432 --> 00:21:58,949
Samuel had a cure.

271
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,435
You got a cure
for Djinn poison?

272
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:03,187
Oh,
I know a <i>few</i> things.

273
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:05,873
Stick around, I'll show you tricks
your daddy never even dreamed of.

274
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,560
Uh...

275
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:11,094
Okay, why are these things
after us?

276
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:13,564
Well, you did stake one
a while back.

277
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,332
After
they came after me,

278
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,600
we were pretty certain

279
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,035
that they were gonna
go gunning for you next.

280
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,872
Lisa and Ben...
they're at the house right now.

281
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,273
- If that thing comes back...
- It's all right.

282
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:24,942
I already sent someone
over there to watch 'em.

283
00:22:24,993 --> 00:22:27,043
You got to
take me home right now.

284
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:36,420
Lisa?!

285
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:38,339
Lisa! Ben?!

286
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,728
Ben!

287
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:12,573
Come on! Come on!

288
00:23:14,024 --> 00:23:15,792
Hey, there you are.

289
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,302
Where the hell
have you been?

290
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:18,887
We... we were at the movies.
You knew that.

291
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,439
Dean, ow.

292
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,808
What happened?

293
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,794
- Go upstairs and pack a bag.
- Where are we going?

294
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,612
I'm taking us
to a friend's house. Go.

295
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,464
It's okay. Go on up.
I'll be there in a sec.

296
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:30,982
What the hell?

297
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,686
Um...

298
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:38,957
Oh, my God.

299
00:23:39,524 --> 00:23:41,859
Lisa, Ben, I don't know
if you remember...

300
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,960
Sam.

301
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:52,987
Damn it.

302
00:23:53,071 --> 00:23:55,539
It's good to see you, too,
Bobby. It's been a while.

303
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:57,808
If you're here,
something's wrong.

304
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:01,328
Bobby,
this is Lisa and Ben.

305
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:02,613
Hi.

306
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:04,999
Well, it's nice to finally
meet you two.

307
00:24:06,668 --> 00:24:09,119
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

308
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,422
Maybe you want to
just go upstairs.

309
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:14,341
TV's broken, but there's plenty
of <i>reader's digest.</i>

310
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:18,462
Just don't touch the decor,
okay?

311
00:24:18,513 --> 00:24:20,047
Assume it's all loaded.

312
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,635
So...

313
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:27,553
Hey, Bobby.

314
00:24:28,473 --> 00:24:29,490
Sam.

315
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,050
You knew?

316
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:43,203
You <i>knew</i> Sam was alive.

317
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:45,189
Yeah.

318
00:24:46,825 --> 00:24:47,708
How long?

319
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,426
- Look...
- How long?!

320
00:24:51,312 --> 00:24:52,296
All year.

321
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,469
Oh, you got to be
<i>kidding</i> me.

322
00:24:58,536 --> 00:25:00,220
- And I'd do it again.
- Why?!

323
00:25:00,305 --> 00:25:01,722
Because you got <i>out,</i>
<i>Dean!</i>

324
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:03,640
You walked away
from the life.

325
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,759
And I was
so <i>damn</i> grateful,

326
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:07,511
you got no idea.

327
00:25:07,562 --> 00:25:09,813
Do you have any clue
what walking away meant for me?

328
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:11,265
Yeah...
a woman and a kid

329
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:14,017
and not getting your guts
ripped out at age 30.

330
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:15,853
<i>That's</i> what it meant.

331
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:17,905
That woman and that kid... I went to
them because <i>you</i> asked me to.

332
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:19,406
- Good.
- Good for who?

333
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:21,024
I showed up
on their doorstep

334
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:23,243
half out of my head
with grief.

335
00:25:23,328 --> 00:25:25,446
God knows why
they even let me in.

336
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,564
I drank too much.
I had nightmares.

337
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:29,733
I looked <i>everywhere.</i>

338
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:31,401
I collected
hundreds of books,

339
00:25:31,453 --> 00:25:32,537
trying to find <i>anything</i>
<i>to bust you out.</i>

340
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:34,706
You promised
you'd leave it alone.

341
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,006
Of <i>course</i>
<i>I didn't leave it alone!</i>

342
00:25:36,057 --> 00:25:37,368
Sue me!

343
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:40,544
A damn year?

344
00:25:40,595 --> 00:25:42,629
You couldn't put me
out of my misery?

345
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:45,716
Look,
I <i>get</i> it wasn't easy.

346
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:47,634
But that's life!

347
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,436
And it's as close
to happiness

348
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:51,054
as I've ever seen
a hunter get.

349
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:55,025
It ain't like
I wanted to lie to you, son.

350
00:25:55,092 --> 00:25:58,028
But you were <i>out,</i> Dean.

351
00:25:58,095 --> 00:26:00,514
Do I look out to you?

352
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:11,658
How's he doing?

353
00:26:11,743 --> 00:26:13,877
- He's okay.
- How are you?

354
00:26:17,465 --> 00:26:20,067
Look, I know Bobby's a little
crotchety, but he's great.

355
00:26:20,135 --> 00:26:22,269
He's gonna look after
you guys.

356
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:24,337
Me and Sam,
we're gonna head out.

357
00:26:28,843 --> 00:26:30,844
For how long?

358
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:38,134
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

359
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:39,469
For what?

360
00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:41,104
Those things
were coming for <i>me</i>

361
00:26:41,172 --> 00:26:42,406
and I should've known.

362
00:26:42,473 --> 00:26:44,942
How could you know
a monster was gonna show up?

363
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:46,643
I should've known.

364
00:26:46,694 --> 00:26:48,278
I should've known,
that if I stayed with you,

365
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:50,497
that something would come,
because something <i>always</i> does.

366
00:26:50,582 --> 00:26:53,634
But I was stupid
and reckless and...

367
00:26:55,286 --> 00:26:57,153
...you can't outrun
your past.

368
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,624
You're saying goodbye.

369
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:21,195
I'm saying I'm sorry...

370
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,614
for everything.

371
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:26,182
Everything.

372
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:27,651
You're an idiot.

373
00:27:27,702 --> 00:27:29,903
I mean, I know it wasn't
greeting-card perfect,

374
00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:31,354
but we were in it <i>together.</i>

375
00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:32,890
I was a wreck
half the time.

376
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:34,458
Yeah, well, the guy that
basically just saved the world

377
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:35,926
shows up at your door,

378
00:27:35,994 --> 00:27:38,795
you <i>expect</i> him
to have a couple of issues.

379
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,634
And you're always
so amazing with Ben.

380
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:50,107
You know what I wanted,
more than anything...

381
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:52,009
was...

382
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:56,712
...a guy that Ben
could look up to...

383
00:27:59,183 --> 00:28:02,069
like...

384
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:03,320
like a dad.

385
00:28:05,773 --> 00:28:09,225
So, you're saying
it's all bad, Dean?

386
00:28:09,277 --> 00:28:11,161
'Cause it was
the best year of my life.

387
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:31,014
What's the plan?

388
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:33,050
Well, right now,
we stock up, get set.

389
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,188
So you're saying
there is no plan.

390
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:39,690
We'll find 'em.

391
00:28:39,757 --> 00:28:41,692
Just got to be patient.

392
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,277
Yeah, okay.

393
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:45,612
Oh, here's an alt.

394
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:48,031
Why don't we go kill
the sons of bitches

395
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,616
that broke into my home?

396
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:51,935
Relax, Dean.
We got it handled.

397
00:28:51,986 --> 00:28:53,269
Djinn are hard to draw out.

398
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:56,323
Now, you've been
out of the game for a while.

399
00:28:56,407 --> 00:28:57,541
Leave it
to the professionals.

400
00:28:57,608 --> 00:28:59,076
Yeah. Sure.

401
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:02,546
Tiny suggestion.

402
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:07,000
You see, Djinn are easier
to draw out when you got bait.

403
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:09,136
They want Sam and me.

404
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,837
They know where I live.

405
00:29:10,922 --> 00:29:12,973
Now, I haven't been hunting
in a while,

406
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:14,791
but I'm gonna
stick my neck out

407
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:16,459
and guess that's a pretty good
place for us to go.

408
00:29:19,764 --> 00:29:21,898
See? It's almost like
I'm a professional.

409
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:35,529
Huh.

410
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,864
I <i>love</i> this one.

411
00:29:37,949 --> 00:29:40,784
Yours or,
uh, your wife's?

412
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,156
Hey.

413
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,159
Do me a favor...
don't touch that.

414
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:53,296
Golf?

415
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:56,266
Really?

416
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,218
It's a... it's a sport.

417
00:30:09,781 --> 00:30:10,947
Nice house.

418
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:16,703
Oh, yeah. Go ahead, say it...
call me a soccer mom.

419
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:17,854
Whatever.

420
00:30:17,905 --> 00:30:19,206
"Soccer mom," huh?

421
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,857
Well, I'll have to look that up
on the "intranet."

422
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:24,661
You know,
believe it or not, I...

423
00:30:24,712 --> 00:30:25,796
I get it, Dean.

424
00:30:25,863 --> 00:30:27,798
You wanted a normal life.

425
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:29,499
Your mom
wanted a normal life, too.

426
00:30:32,003 --> 00:30:35,555
You remind me of her,
actually.

427
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,525
The attitude,
for one thing.

428
00:30:38,593 --> 00:30:41,711
Your brother tell you what we been
dealing with the past few months?

429
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:43,847
No, not really.

430
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:45,715
I've never seen
anything quite like it.

431
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:47,401
Been working
'round the clock.

432
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:49,069
- So what's going on?
- We don't know.

433
00:30:49,137 --> 00:30:50,404
But whatever it is,

434
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:52,439
it goes way past
a couple of Djinn acting off.

435
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:55,392
Nocturnals attacking in broad daylight,

436
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,660
werewolves out on the half-moon,

437
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:58,128
creatures that we've never
even seen before.

438
00:30:58,196 --> 00:30:59,696
We don't... we don't even know
what they are.

439
00:30:59,747 --> 00:31:02,749
I'm knee-deep
in half-eaten human hearts

440
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:05,118
and exsanguinated
10-year-olds,

441
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:06,787
and it's all making me...

442
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:09,623
uneasy.

443
00:31:09,707 --> 00:31:12,125
So what's your theory?

444
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,760
You tell me.

445
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:16,046
All we really know
is it's all hands on deck.

446
00:31:16,114 --> 00:31:17,413
We're counting on each other
right now.

447
00:31:17,465 --> 00:31:19,415
That's how it is
with Campbells'.

448
00:31:20,902 --> 00:31:22,469
We need you, Dean.

449
00:31:22,553 --> 00:31:24,104
Look,
I hear you, but...

450
00:31:24,188 --> 00:31:26,239
You don't know
what you're part of, Dean.

451
00:31:29,811 --> 00:31:34,314
You know, you had ancestors
hacking the heads off vamps

452
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:35,749
on the <i>Mayflower.</i>

453
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:41,655
What I'm saying
is that, we're your blood.

454
00:31:41,722 --> 00:31:43,073
And we're out there dying,

455
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:45,225
trying to get in front of
whatever this is.

456
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:47,511
Maybe not the best time for golf.

457
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,104
Hey.

458
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:07,797
You don't really
say much, do you?

459
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:09,798
Enough.

460
00:32:10,634 --> 00:32:11,785
Any sign of 'em?

461
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,312
Three Djinn
off in the trees.

462
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,958
Here.

463
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:37,627
Those Djinn are just sitting
out there, watching us.

464
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:39,513
- Everybody's got to clear out.
- What?

465
00:32:39,597 --> 00:32:41,765
They're not gonna come in here
until me and Sam are alone.

466
00:32:41,832 --> 00:32:43,633
So, what, I'm supposed to
leave you here with no backup?

467
00:32:43,684 --> 00:32:45,168
Dean's right.

468
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:48,221
They're smart. They'd wait
till they weren't outnumbered.

469
00:32:51,225 --> 00:32:52,692
All right,
we won't be far.

470
00:32:52,777 --> 00:32:54,279
You call when they come,
you hear?

471
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:56,779
You bet!

472
00:32:57,732 --> 00:32:59,232
All right, pack up.
We're out of here.

473
00:33:22,723 --> 00:33:23,773
You okay?

474
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:27,811
Oh, yeah.

475
00:33:27,878 --> 00:33:29,896
Yeah.

476
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:32,065
No, this is...

477
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:33,767
this is crazy.

478
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:35,986
I mean, you, grandpa.

479
00:33:36,053 --> 00:33:38,071
Whoever brought you back...

480
00:33:38,155 --> 00:33:40,523
- They don't want to be found.
- Yeah, I get that.

481
00:33:40,575 --> 00:33:43,109
But who are they, and what do
they... what do they want? Why?

482
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:44,494
That's a good question.

483
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:50,500
Do you remember it?

484
00:33:53,371 --> 00:33:54,504
What?

485
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:55,538
The cage.

486
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,623
Yeah.

487
00:33:56,707 --> 00:33:58,174
You want to...

488
00:33:58,242 --> 00:34:00,710
No.

489
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:02,245
Well, if anybody
can relate...

490
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:05,015
Dean, I don't want
to talk about it. I'm back.

491
00:34:05,082 --> 00:34:08,134
I get to breathe fresh air,
h-have a beer,

492
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,053
hunt with my family,
see <i>you</i> again.

493
00:34:10,104 --> 00:34:12,489
So why exactly would I want
to think about hell?

494
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:16,309
And you really think...

495
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:35,613
Dean, they're already dead
and you know it.

496
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:36,864
This is happening
because of me!

497
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:38,032
Dean!

498
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:02,223
Sid.

499
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,469
You made it through
that last trip,

500
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:18,639
so how about
a big, fat double dose?

501
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:24,311
Bad news... it'll kill you.

502
00:35:24,363 --> 00:35:25,663
The good news?

503
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:28,616
At least you'll go fast.

504
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:41,178
That's for our father,
you son of a bitch.

505
00:36:26,558 --> 00:36:29,260
I just... I-I
couldn't sleep at that house.

506
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:35,483
It's okay.
Don't worry. We'll call Dean.

507
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,885
Ah, don't worry
about them, Dean.

508
00:36:37,936 --> 00:36:38,936
Worry about me.

509
00:36:49,615 --> 00:36:51,115
No!

510
00:37:04,346 --> 00:37:06,747
There, there, kiddo.

511
00:37:06,798 --> 00:37:08,849
You stay away from him!

512
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:13,688
Lisa!

513
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:19,860
- Drink it.
- Ben, no!

514
00:37:21,146 --> 00:37:22,146
You'll feel better.

515
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:22,980
No!

516
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:28,819
It's all your fault.

517
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:33,124
Lisa!

518
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,459
This, something else...

519
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,378
we both know that's details.

520
00:37:37,445 --> 00:37:39,747
There's something's
coming for this one

521
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:41,298
and you can't stop it.

522
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:43,000
It's all your fault.

523
00:37:43,085 --> 00:37:44,418
- Lisa!
- Drink it.

524
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:45,586
You'll feel better.

525
00:37:45,637 --> 00:37:46,837
- Ben, don't!
- Your fault.

526
00:37:46,922 --> 00:37:48,288
Can't stop it.

527
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:51,458
No!

528
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:14,281
I got her, go get Dean.

529
00:38:26,294 --> 00:38:28,045
Got her.

530
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,964
Relax, hon.
We're not gonna kill you.

531
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:32,499
Get her in the van. Quick, now,
before the boys get back.

532
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:33,768
Come on. Come on.

533
00:38:52,884 --> 00:38:54,250
So, Samuel
and the cuzzes?

534
00:38:54,302 --> 00:38:56,019
Don't know.
They left in a hurry.

535
00:38:56,087 --> 00:38:57,971
I'm meeting them
back at their place.

536
00:38:58,056 --> 00:39:01,191
You, uh,
you coming with me?

537
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:02,993
No.

538
00:39:03,061 --> 00:39:04,945
No, I'm going back
for Lisa and Ben.

539
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:06,396
I thought you said...

540
00:39:06,447 --> 00:39:07,731
I did.
I changed my mind.

541
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:12,619
Look, I practically
shoved you at them.

542
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:14,738
That's a funny way to put it,
but all right.

543
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:16,623
I'm just saying,
I really wanted that for you.

544
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:19,376
And when I told you to go,
I-I thought...

545
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:21,378
You could have it,
you know?

546
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,279
But now
I'm not so sure.

547
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:25,332
I mean,
you got to consider the fact

548
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:28,318
that you'll be putting them
in danger if you go back.

549
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:30,837
So, what, it's better to
leave them alone, unprotected,

550
00:39:30,922 --> 00:39:32,255
and then they're <i>not</i> in danger?

551
00:39:32,306 --> 00:39:33,807
I did this to them.

552
00:39:33,891 --> 00:39:36,176
I made them vulnerable the
moment I knocked on their door,

553
00:39:36,244 --> 00:39:38,345
and I can't undo that.

554
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:41,198
But what I <i>can</i> do
is go with the best option.

555
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:47,270
I hear you.

556
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,441
I guess I just, uh...

557
00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:54,161
wish you were coming, that's all.

558
00:39:54,245 --> 00:39:55,495
Why?

559
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:59,299
- Don't be stupid.
- No, I mean it.

560
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:01,918
I mean, you know plenty of
good hunters, I'm rusty.

561
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:04,087
I did something seriously stupid
going out there.

562
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:05,455
I almost got us both killed.

563
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:07,791
And that's exactly
why I want you.

564
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:09,393
What are you
talking about?

565
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,595
You just went.

566
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,329
You didn't hesitate.

567
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:15,248
Because you care,
and that's who you are.

568
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:19,019
Me?

569
00:40:19,103 --> 00:40:20,470
I wouldn't even
think to <i>try.</i>

570
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:21,521
Yes, you would.

571
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:25,258
No, Dean.

572
00:40:25,326 --> 00:40:28,779
I'm telling you, it's just
better with you around,

573
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,113
that's all.

574
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:34,901
Listen...

575
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,993
she should be hunting.
Take her.

576
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,467
Thanks. Really.

577
00:40:52,336 --> 00:40:54,554
But I already got my car
set up how I like it.

578
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:57,340
I should hit the road.

579
00:40:59,343 --> 00:41:01,377
I'll walk you out.

580
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:09,102
Keep in touch,
you hear?

581
00:41:09,187 --> 00:41:11,888
'Course.

582
00:41:16,244 --> 00:41:19,079
It was really good
to see you again, Dean.
