Hey, Dean.
It's me.

00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:09,512
- How long you been back, Sam?
- About a year.

3
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:11,618
You been back practically this whole time?!

4
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:13,153
You finally had what you wanted, Dean.

5
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:14,705
I wanted my <i>brother,</i> alive.

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:16,039
You wanted a family.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,709
You only gave it up
because of the way we lived.

8
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:21,545
But you had something,
and you were <i>building</i> something.

9
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,046
You got <i>out,</i> Dean!

10
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:24,715
You walked away from the life.

11
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:26,600
And it's as close to happiness

12
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,469
as I've ever seen a hunter get.

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,170
I hooked up with some other people.

- You? Working with strangers?
- They're more like family.

16
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:35,776

17
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:37,077
Like your mom.

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,080

20
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:46,787
You can't be.

21
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:49,640
We're guessing whatever
pulled Sam up pulled me down.

22
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:52,209
- But you don't know what that is.
- Bingo.

can make itself look like anyone?

No, I'm going back for Lisa and Ben.

You'll be putting them in danger.

30
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,876
So, what, it's better to
leave them alone, unprotected

31
00:01:09,928 --> 00:01:11,428
and then they're <i>not</i> in danger?

32
00:01:11,513 --> 00:01:13,480

moment I knocked on their door.

00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:04,042
But?

365
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,095
But... Moving them around,
keeping them on lock down...

366
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:10,899
I mean, you do have them
on lock down, right?

367
00:21:15,388 --> 00:21:17,856
How is any of that different
from how we were raised?

368
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,941
So you're saying...

369
00:21:21,944 --> 00:21:23,244
[Exhales sharply]

370
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:25,346
I'm not shoving anybody
into this life, okay?

371
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:26,648
This is temporary.

372
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:27,833
[Scoffs]

373
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,534
Dad always said it was temporary, Dean.

374
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:32,738
He said it for 22 years.

375
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:34,189
Look, I get it.

376
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,208
You want to watch out for them.
That's great.

377
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,743
I'm just asking...

378
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:40,812
how do you do that
and not turn into dad?

379
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:47,002
[Sighs lightly]

380
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:52,841
[Sighs]

381
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:54,476
[Paper rustles]

382
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:57,929
Crap. I can't believe I missed this.

383
00:21:58,014 --> 00:21:59,181
What?

384
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:00,649
This house on Elm,

385
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:03,268
the... the mother was killed,
baby was grabbed,

386
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:06,504
but daddy wasn't living in the house
at the time, so he's still alive.

387
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:08,623
What do you say we
go and have a chat?

388
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:10,025
I say let's.

389
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:11,243
[Bobby John cries]

390
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:12,661
[Sighing] Oh.

391
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:15,063
You go.

392
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:16,364
You sure?

393
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:18,083
Unless you got a badge for Bobby John,

394
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,417
yeah, I'm sure.

395
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:21,586
[Crying continues]

396
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:28,593
[Door closes]

397
00:22:28,678 --> 00:22:30,078
[Crying stops]

398
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:32,347
It's good, isn't it?
[Bobby John coos]

399
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:34,850
I just...

400
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,518
I still can't believe it.

401
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:38,386
I mean, I... it's one thing

402
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:41,389
to die like... that.

403
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,891
[Sighs]
Poor baby.

404
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,609
Just into thin air.

405
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:46,594
No thanks to you guys.

406
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:48,780
Well, that's why I'm here.

407
00:22:48,865 --> 00:22:51,032
[Sighs]

408
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,400
You had filed for divorce?

409
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:56,054
It's important. I'm sorry.

410
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:57,422
She, uh...

411
00:22:57,439 --> 00:23:00,125
She cheated on me.

412
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:02,878
And, well, I caught her.

413
00:23:04,914 --> 00:23:07,566
And did you know the other man?

414
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:10,001
No, I... I mean, I didn't
<i>catch her,</i> catch her,

415
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:13,004
but she lied to me.

416
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:14,689
Okay.

417
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:18,510
[Sighs lightly]
We hadn't...

418
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,731
- you know, in a while.
- Ahh.

419
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:24,649
And... and then...
then she's pregnant.

420
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:26,818
- What did she say?
- She said it was mine.

421
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:29,070
I know.

422
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:30,772
And... and I said, "that's impossible,"

423
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:32,190
and "what is she talking about?"

424
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:33,658
And she says, "don't you remember

425
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:36,077
when you went out of town and
you came back early and we..."

426
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,280
But you didn't?

427
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:40,665
No.

428
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,286
I was at a damn softball tournament.

429
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:47,105
Whoever he was, he's the father.

430
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:54,930
[Buzzing]

431
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:04,856
[Inhales deeply]

432
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:06,141
[Pop]

433
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:08,443
[Bobby John cries]

434
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:15,116
[Cellphone rings]

435
00:24:16,852 --> 00:24:18,820
Yeah?

436
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:21,072
Sam: I talked to the father.
He checks out, but the baby...

437
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:22,457
Yeah?

438
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,959
I think the shape-shifter is its dad.

439
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:26,494
[Wails]

440
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:29,364
You think?

441
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:40,191
Man: Manager. Everything okay in there?

442
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:41,975
Yeah. No, we're... we're...
we're fine, thank you.

443
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:43,494
Good night.

444
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:45,646
There's been complaints.
You mind opening the door, sir?

445
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:48,449
Uh, it's not a good time.

446
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,418
Just... just got out of the shower.

447
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:51,786
[Crying continues]

448
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,137
Shh.

449
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:15,026
- Get out of the way.
- Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

450
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,061
A child should be with his father.

451
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:19,263
Well, I got to be honest... I'm not
really seeing the family resemblance.

452
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:23,484
I'm not just talking about me.

453
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:24,969
I'm talking about <i>our</i> father.

454
00:25:40,502 --> 00:25:42,202
[Gunshot]

455
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:45,639
[Bobby John cries]

456
00:25:48,543 --> 00:25:50,144
Well, there goes our deposit.

457
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:01,221
You know, it's pretty smart, actually.

458
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:02,857
I mean, shifter poses as a guard
for the security company

459
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:04,208
to get near the house.

460
00:26:04,242 --> 00:26:05,743
Then it scopes out the fam.

461
00:26:05,827 --> 00:26:08,496
Yeah. Then daddy takes off,
and the shifter <i>becomes</i> daddy.

462
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:10,731
Few glasses of wine, shakes mama's trees,

463
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:13,400
comes back in nine months
to collect its prize.

464
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:16,087
I didn't even know they <i>had</i> babies.

465
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:17,955
I thought they were
just freaks of nature,

466
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,339
like... like X-Men style.

467
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:21,292
Yeah, you learn something new
every day, huh?

468
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:24,545
I've never seen a baby monster before.

469
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:25,746
Yeah.

470
00:26:25,747 --> 00:26:27,465
Of course, it's not really a monster.

471
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:29,467
I mean, it's still just a baby.

472
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:31,302
It's not its fault its dad's a shifter.

473
00:26:31,386 --> 00:26:33,420
Right, but it's a shifter, too.

474
00:26:33,472 --> 00:26:35,356
It still doesn't change the fact
that we've got to...

475
00:26:35,423 --> 00:26:37,892
we've got to look after this thing.

476
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:39,527
But what the hell
are we gonna do with it?

477
00:26:39,594 --> 00:26:41,228
We can't actually drop it off
at an orphanage.

478
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,980
They might get upset
when it turns Asian.

479
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:45,783
Samuel.

480
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:46,817
What?

481
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:48,702
Samuel.

482
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,070
He'll know what to do.

483
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:51,572
You want to bring it to a bunch of hunters?

484
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:53,941
They're not just hunters, Dean.
They're our family.

485
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:56,293
- We don't know them.
- I do.

486
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:58,546
Not every hunter is a head case.

487
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:01,048
I mean Samuel is
actually a lot like you.

488
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,385
I'm a freakin' head case.

489
00:27:04,452 --> 00:27:06,670
Well... pitch a better idea then.

490
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:12,893
Great. Samuel it is.

491
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:57,855
Well, aren't you just the best
disguise a monster ever wore.

492
00:27:57,939 --> 00:27:59,239
[Chuckles]

493
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:02,009
I'm kidding, Dean.

494
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,342
Relax.

495
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,344
Oh, you got something to say?

496
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,482
No? All right. Well, you just
stand there and <i>think</i> at me.

497
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:16,653
So, what's our next move?

498
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,204
Well, I got a couple ideas.

499
00:28:18,288 --> 00:28:21,157
Dean, let me see the little guy.

500
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:22,575
That's all right. I got him.

501
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,410
What do you think I'm gonna do?

502
00:28:27,197 --> 00:28:29,082
You really don't want me
to answer that question.

503
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:32,601
Christian: Well, I'm curious.

504
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,970
Who exactly do you think we are?

505
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:37,006
Hunters.

506
00:28:37,057 --> 00:28:38,307
That's funny.

507
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:40,560
Here I've been thinking we're family.

508
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:42,395
Hey. Let's not get worked up.

509
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:44,714
Yeah, yeah. Let's not.

510
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:49,986
Here, Dean.

511
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:51,187
It's fine.

512
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,722
Let me take him.

513
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,073
It's okay.

514
00:29:00,164 --> 00:29:01,464

515
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,503
Oh, you're a big fella, aren't you?

516
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:11,841
Yeah. I haven't held
one of these in a long time.

517
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:14,427
Your mom was the tiniest.

518
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:16,912
She was bald as a cue ball.

519
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:21,651
All right, so what the hell
are we gonna do with him?

520
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,686
- Raise him?
- Raise him.

521
00:29:23,754 --> 00:29:26,088
- What, you got another suggestion?
- But...

522
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,473
It's dangerous out
there for him, Dean.

523
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:28,775
And what about in here?

524
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:30,026
What are we gonna study him, poke at him?

525
00:29:30,027 --> 00:29:32,594
Your mind goes right to torture, Dean.

526
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,446
Don't assume that for everyone.

527
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,864
- What exactly are you trying to say?
- Sorry, I heard about what you majored in,

528
00:29:38,435 --> 00:29:39,652
down in the pit?

529
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,953
What the hell is your problem, man?

530
00:29:42,992 --> 00:29:44,373
[Sighs] You're starting
to become a pain in my ass.

531
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:47,242
Christian, take it easy, man.
He's my brother.

532
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:51,113
Samuel:
We all done bristling up here or what?

533
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,449
Nobody's doing anything to him, Dean.

534
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,835
When he's old enough,
we throw it to him.

535
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,204
He wants to volunteer
to help out, that's fine.

536
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,307
Could be great.

537
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,143
How?

538
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:06,678
Think of the kind of hunter
he'll grow up to be.

539
00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:12,068
You all are <i>joking,</i> right?

540
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:13,436
I mean, come on!

Why can't you give me
an inch of trust, Dean?

544
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:24,997
Maybe because you two
are suddenly back from the dead,

545
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:27,366
and I seem to be the only one who wants
to know how the hell that happened!

You're not the only
one who wants to know.

Yeah, we do.

come from somewhere, right?

And why nothing we had stopped it.

find the baby anywhere,

that he could feel it,

What's that?

623
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,579
Just before you, uh, ganked
that shifter in the motel,

624
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:54,631
he mentioned a father,

625
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:57,417
which makes sense now,
'cause he meant the Alpha.

626
00:35:57,502 --> 00:36:00,886
- Huh. Yeah, I guess so.
- Did you hear him say that?

627

Why?

631
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:10,547
Well, 'cause if you heard him,

632
00:36:10,598 --> 00:36:12,516
then... then you knew
the Alpha was out there.

633
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:15,718
Okay.

634
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,103
And if you knew the
Alpha was out there,

635
00:36:17,188 --> 00:36:18,605
then you knew he
might come after the baby.

636
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:22,058
In which case, you were using
the baby as bait.

637
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:23,810
So, was that the plan,

638
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:26,495
- to use the baby as bait?
- Of course not.
