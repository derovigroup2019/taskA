1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,327
I don't believe it.

2
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:04,796
Wyoming?
What does that mean?

3
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:07,832
Each of these X's is an
abandoned frontier church...

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,867
all mid-19th century,
built by Samuel Colt.

5
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:11,335
Samuel Colt...

6
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:12,405
the demon-killing,
gun-making Samuel Colt?

7
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:13,805
Yep.

8
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:18,242
He built private railway lines
connecting church to church.

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,547
It just happens
to lay out like this.

10
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,815
It's a devil's trap.

11
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:25,550
A 100-square-mile
devil's trap.

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,821
1973.

13
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:31,456
- What is this?
- What does it look like?

14
00:00:31,523 --> 00:00:33,057
- Is it real?
- Very.

15
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,326
Okay, so, what, angels got
their hands on some DeLoreans?

16
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:36,527
How did I get here?

17
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:38,996
Time is fluid, Dean.

18
00:00:39,064 --> 00:00:41,099
It's not easy, but we <i>can</i>
bend it on occasion.

19
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,767
But I'm thinking you know
"Purgatory."

20
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:45,937
This is all about opening a
door to let something in.

21
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,438
- What?
- I'm working on it.

22
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,973
- Could you give us something?
- I got a name.

23
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,441
"Mother of all."

24
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,943
We got zero on ganking her.

25
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,078
We have so much to do.
Let's get started.

26
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,421
She has a message for you.

27
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:04,655
Oh, yeah? What's that?

28
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:06,157
You're all gonna die.

29
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:09,950
Season 6 Episode 18
"Frontierland"

30
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:13,291
Hyah!

31
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:20,498
It's here, somewhere.
I know it.

32
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:21,532
Help me move this.

33
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,348
Well, I'll be damned.

34
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:46,891
Welcome to the Campbell
family library.

35
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:01,405
So, Samuel collected
all this stuff, huh?

36
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,607
Apparently.

37
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:04,075
Wow.

38
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,944
All right, well,
what are we looking for?

39
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:09,547
Well, anything that'll put a run
in the Octomom's stockings.

40
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:11,082
Pick a row.

41
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,234
Bingo.

42
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:36,207
Either of you jokers ever heard
anything about a Phoenix?

43
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,643
River, Joaquin,
or the giant flaming bird?

44
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,177
It says here

45
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:43,481
that the ashes of a Phoenix
can burn the mother.

46
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:45,883
The mother?

47
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:47,785
Great.
Where do we get one?

48
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,587
You got me.
I thought it was a myth.

49
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:52,456
All right, great.

50
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,726
Well, let's see if we can find
something out about a Phoenix.

51
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:14,245
Guys.

52
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:15,713
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,

53
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:18,649
check <i>this</i> out.

54
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,485
"March 5, 1861.

55
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,054
"Sunrise, Wyoming.

56
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:24,889
"Gun killed a Phoenix today.

57
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,958
"Left a pile
of smoldering ash."

58
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:30,528
Really? Whose gun?

59
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,196
Colt's.

60
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:33,698
Colt? Colt like --

61
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:35,032
Like the Colt.

62
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,133
From...

63
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:41,272
...Samuel Colt's Journal.

64
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:45,209
What?!

65
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:46,544
- That's his?
- Yeah.

66
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:48,612
- Dude, no.
- Dude, yes.

67
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,881
- Well, let me see it.
- Get your own.

68
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:53,184
Well, what else did he say
about the Phoenix?

69
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,119
What does it look like?
Has it got feathers?

70
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:57,221
It just says "Phoenix."

71
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:59,423
- Did he say where he tracked it?
- No.

72
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:01,792
All right, so I guess
we got to find one of our own,

73
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,860
whatever it is.

74
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,130
I know where we can find one.

75
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:13,304
March 5, 1861.
Sunrise, Wyoming.

76
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:14,839
We'll "Star Trek IV"
this bitch.

77
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:19,009
I only watched
"Deep Space Nine."

78
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,682
It's like I don't even
know you guys anymore.

79
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,517
"Star Trek IV."
Save the whales.

80
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:31,021
We hop back in time,
we join up with Samuel Colt,

81
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:32,323
we hunt the Phoenix,

82
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:33,924
and then we haul the ashes
back home with us.

83
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:37,261
- Time travel?
- Yeah.

84
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:38,696
That's a reasonable plan?

85
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:40,264
We got a guy who can swing it.

86
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:47,805
Castiel.

87
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:51,609
The, uh, fate of the world
is in the balance.

88
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:53,210
So, come on down here.

89
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,148
Come on, Cass,

90
00:05:57,215 --> 00:06:00,050
"I Dream of Jeannie"
your ass down here pronto.

91
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:02,186
Please.

92
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,290
Jeannie?

93
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:08,225
Rachel.

94
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:10,394
I understand
you need some assistance?

95
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:11,429
How can I help you?

96
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:16,967
Well, uh, we kind of need
to talk to the <i>Big Kahuna.</i>

97
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:18,736
I'm here on Castiel's behalf.

98
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:19,870
Where is <i>he?</i>

99
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:20,771
Busy.

100
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,907
- Busy?
- Yes.

101
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:24,375
Well, we've got a line

102
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:27,011
on the mother
of freaking everything, so --

103
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:29,213
I'm sure your issue's
very important.

104
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:32,183
But Castiel is currently
commanding an army, so --

105
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,018
So we get stuck
with Miss Moneypenny.

106
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:36,086
So you need
to learn your place.

107
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:38,122
Look, I don't know who you
<i>think</i> you are --

108
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,857
- I'm his friend.
- What, you think we're <i>not?</i>

109
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:42,593
I think you call him
when you need something.

110
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:45,396
We're fighting a war.

111
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:46,764
We get that.

112
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:48,799
Clearly you <i>don't,</i>
or you wouldn't call him

113
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,935
every time you stub your toe,

114
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:52,670
you petty, entitled little piece...

115
00:06:52,737 --> 00:06:54,737
Rachel.

116
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,843
That's enough.

117
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:02,513
I told you
I'd take care of this.

118
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:04,415
It's all right.
You can go.

119
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:06,683
- You're staying?
- Go.

120
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:08,686
I'll come when I can.

121
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,757
Wow.

122
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:15,526
Friend of yours?

123
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:18,362
Yes.
She's, uh, my lieutenant.

124
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,066
She's...
committed to the cause.

125
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,834
Now, what do you need?

126
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:28,072
Where the hell's Dean?

127
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,875
Supply run, he said.
I don't know.

128
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,143
Um, about your plan.

129
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:35,279
You'll only have 24 hours.

130
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:37,548
Wait, what?

131
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:38,983
Why?

132
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,918
Well, the answer
to your question

133
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:42,286
can best be expressed

134
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:44,488
as a series of partial
differential equations.

135
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:47,925
Yeah, aim lower.

136
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:50,794
The further back I send you,

137
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:53,163
the harder it becomes
to retrieve you.

138
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,732
24 hours is all I can risk.

139
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:57,201
If I don't pull you home
within that time,

140
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,936
you'll be lost to me.

141
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:01,539
Well, then we better
get you a watch.

142
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,808
What the hell's all that?

143
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:07,912
We are going native.

144
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,713
Got to blend in.

145
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:13,183
Uh, no, thanks.
I'm fine.

146
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,952
- Sam.
- Dean, I can... I can wear this.

147
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,654
And look like a spaceman?

148
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:18,188
Look, just because you're obsessed
with all that Wild West stuff...

149
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:19,924
- No, I'm not.
- You have a fetish.

150
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:21,625
Shut up.
I like old movies.

151
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:24,228
You can recite every Clint Eastwood
movie ever made, line for line.

152
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,004
Even the monkey movies?

153
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,797
Yeah. <i>Especially</i>
the monkey movies.

154
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:28,032
His name is Clyde.

155
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:32,369
At least wear the damn shirt.

156
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:40,411
Dean, this is stupid.

157
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,246
I look stupid.

158
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:47,451
You going to a hoedown?

159
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,920
Now, is it... is it customary
to wear a blanket?

160
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,422
It's a <i>sarape.</i>

161
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,890
And, yes.
It's, uh...

162
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:57,394
Never mind.
Let's just go.

163
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,064
What's this?

164
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:02,533
Where you're goin',
they don't take plastic.

165
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,604
I'll send you back
to March 4th.

166
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,439
That should give you time
to find the Colt...

167
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:12,876
...and this
Phoenix creature.

168
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:16,513
All right, well,
see ya at High Noon tomorrow...

169
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:18,548
Partner!

170
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:33,430
Oh, now we're talking.

171
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:34,865
I have to go.

172
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,467
What about
getting the boys back?

173
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,636
Pray for me in 24 hours,
and I'll return.

174
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,071
I'll pray for all of us.

175
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:48,045
All right.
Let's go find Samuel Colt.

176
00:09:48,113 --> 00:09:50,381
Hey, we should
try the Saloon first,

177
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:52,383
uh, see what we get
from the locals.

178
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,951
Sure.
Whatever, Sundance.

179
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:55,486
Think we'll have time
to hit on saloon girls?

180
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:58,288
I'm kidding.

181
00:09:58,356 --> 00:09:59,657
Come on.

182
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:02,426
Oh, damn it.

183
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:04,962
Come on.

184
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,397
You know what that is?

185
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:07,631
Yeah, it's horse...

186
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:08,832
Authenticity!

187
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,414
We stand here today...
March 4th, 1861...

188
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:27,484
to execute justice
upon Elias Finch

189
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:30,688
for the murder of his own wife.

190
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,924
Wow.
Talk about authenticity.

191
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:36,093
Sentence handed down
by myself,

192
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:40,831
Tye Mortimer, duly appointed
judge of the Wyoming circuit.

193
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:46,370
You will be hung by your neck
until you die.

194
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,872
You got anything to say?

195
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,875
You're gonna burn for this.

196
00:10:57,015 --> 00:10:58,048
Every one of you.

197
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:11,428
Good times.

198
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,433
So where do we find Sammy Colt?

199
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,035
No idea.

200
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:21,472
Huh.

201
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,107
I think I know
who to ask, though.

202
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,848
Nice blanket.

203
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,936
Sheriff?

204
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,104
Can we have a word?

205
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,207
Depends who's askin'.

206
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:01,245
Marshal Eastwood.

207
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:04,915
Clint Eastwood.

208
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,455
This here is, uh, Walker.

209
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,589
He's a Texas Ranger.

210
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,494
So, what can I do for you boys?

211
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:18,729
Uh, we're looking for a man.

212
00:12:18,797 --> 00:12:20,297
I'll bet.

213
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,233
Nice shirt, there.

214
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:25,269
What's wrong with my shirt?

215
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:27,271
You're very clean.

216
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:33,277
It's dirtier than it looks.

217
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:35,145
We need to find Samuel Colt.

218
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,346
Do you know him?

219
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:38,315
- The gun maker?
- Yeah. Is he in town?

220
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,851
Not that I know of.

221
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,120
Might try asking Elkins
over at the Saloon.

222
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:45,856
Been here longer than God.

223
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:12,015
This is not awesome.

224
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:19,957
Hi.

225
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,425
What'll you have?

226
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:24,461
Oh, uh, okay. Great.

227
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,330
I'll have
your top-shelf whiskey.

228
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:28,599
Only have the one shelf.

229
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,000
That'll do just fine.

230
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:32,735
And he'll have a sarsaparilla.

231
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:40,477
You Elkins?

232
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:42,312
One and only.

233
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,148
You know a man
named Samuel Colt?

234
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:48,852
He passed through here
about four years ago.

235
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,488
He still around?

236
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:53,824
Rumor is, he's building
a railroad stop

237
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:57,227
20 miles out of town,
just by the Postal road.

238
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,762
Middle of nowhere.

239
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,864
The Devil's Gate?

240
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:02,232
Location fits.

241
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,736
Howdy, boys.

242
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,874
Darla's my best girl.

243
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:16,580
Try me.

244
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,349
You want a kiss?

245
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:24,187
S-so much more germier
than I pictured.

246
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,759
Darla!

247
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,960
Ah.

248
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:32,195
Judge.

249
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:35,732
Nice to see you.

250
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,001
I thought we had a date.

251
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:54,985
Wow, that was a close one.

252
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:56,453
I guess it's good to be judge.

253
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,721
Yeah.

254
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:02,159
Ohh. It's like gasoline.

255
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:04,828
Sarsaparilla ain't half bad.

256
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,739
- You okay, Sheriff?
- 'Course I'm okay.

257
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:50,973
It was a ghost!

258
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,642
It wasn't a ghost.

259
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,078
Unless ghosts leave footprints.

260
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:00,783
I am telling you,
Elias Finch was here.

261
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:03,252
He did... that,

262
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,354
and then he walked
out that door.

263
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,023
Rope didn't kill him.

264
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,357
Seen it before.

265
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,093
Well, you got any idea
where he could be?

266
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,028
Could be a thousand places.

267
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,330
Well, you got a way
to flush him out?

268
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:17,166
'Course.
We're gonna form a posse.

269
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:18,868
Then we're gonna
string Finch up right.

270
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,004
Put a bullet in his head
for good measure.

271
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:24,240
That actually sounds
like a good plan.

272
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:25,741
You two should come along.

273
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:28,478
Meet downstairs at dawn.

274
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:30,213
Yeah, we'll be there.

275
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,549
Get yourselves
some real gear first, huh?

276
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:40,056
Well, I think we ought
to pay our respects to Finch.

277
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,791
I was thinking the same thing.

278
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:46,762
You thinking what I'm thinking?

279
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:54,370
Rose from the ashes,
burned up its victim?

280
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:56,539
You know, maybe we're not
looking for a flaming bird.

281
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:58,774
Maybe the Phoenix is actually
walking around in cowboy boots.

282
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:00,109
That makes sense, right?

283
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:01,677
Could be Finch.

284
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:05,615
So, question is,
how do we put this thing out?

285
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,518
Well, we do know one thing

286
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:10,019
that'll kill friggin'
<i>anything,</i> right?

287
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,354
Yeah, the Colt.

288
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:12,722
So, you go get the gun.

289
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:14,590
But isn't the gun coming here?

290
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,093
I mean, according
to Samuel Colt's journal?

291
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,096
Yeah, but people here
barely even know who Colt is.

292
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,199
Maybe you got to go find him
and make history.

293
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,368
I'll stay here,
hook up with the posse.

294
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:26,602
'Cause you know me...

295
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,870
I'm a posse magnet.

296
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,873
I mean, I love posse.

297
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:34,143
Make that into a t-shirt.

298
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:35,578
You done?

299
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:40,616
Look, the problem is,
Colt's 20 miles outside of town.

300
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,885
How am I supposed to get
there and back before noon?

301
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,427
Ride 'em, cowboy.

302
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:58,934
Wh... uh, try...
try the other side.

303
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:03,506
- Yeah, good boy.
- Right. Yeah. Right.

304
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:13,082
Hey.

305
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,283
This actually feels all right.

306
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:15,785
All right, take it...
just take it easy.

307
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:17,220
Yeah, you bet. I'm good.

308
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:19,488
- All right, 11:00 A.M., right?
- Don't be late!

309
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,556
- Okay.
- All right.

310
00:18:20,624 --> 00:18:21,490
Go on. Go.

311
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,525
Hyah!

312
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:26,062
I'm okay!

313
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:28,064
That poor horse.

314
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,136
Forgive me! I'm sorry!

315
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:08,638
You had your chance.

316
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,339
Tell it to the judge.

317
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,222
We need to talk.

318
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,723
You <i>summoned</i> me here?

319
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,759
Castiel,
I've been hearing things.

320
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:34,797
Things I don't want to believe.

321
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,833
Just tell me if it's true.

322
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:39,902
If what's true?

323
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,337
You know.

324
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:44,173
Your dirty little secret.

325
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,711
I have to defeat Raphael.

326
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:50,613
- Not this way, Castiel.
- Rachel.

327
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:53,382
We put our faith in you, and...

328
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:56,485
...look what
you're turning into.

329
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:03,659
I don't have a choice.

330
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:05,027
Then neither do I.

331
00:20:53,677 --> 00:20:56,212
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:10,827 --> 00:21:13,963
What the hell is going on?!

333
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:17,466
Cass?

334
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:36,752
Cass?

335
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:39,989
Are we running or fighting?

336
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:43,225
We're...

337
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:45,995
Balls.

338
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:05,648
New hat.

339
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,317
I look good.

340
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:11,620
Where's the posse?

341
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:14,457
I must be early.

342
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:18,394
Or you're the only greenhorn
dumb enough

343
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,795
to go chasing after a ghost.

344
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:20,996
What are you talking about?

345
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:22,631
Sheriff's tough as nails.
He'll be here.

346
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:25,167
Oh, God!
The Sheriff's dead!

347
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:30,473
Or not.

348
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:36,178
Great.

349
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:37,613
Who's the Sheriff now?

350
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:46,922
What. What...

351
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,124
Now...

352
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:51,727
Congratulations, Sheriff.

353
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:06,601
Ahh.

354
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:13,842
Samuel Colt?

355
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,213
You have the wrong drunk,
gentlemen.

356
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:19,614
Have a nice day.

357
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:21,849
We've been looking
for you, Colt.

358
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:23,718
And who might "we" be?

359
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:30,358
Listen...

360
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:33,428
I've long since hung it up.

361
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,230
I'm tired,
and I'm too damn old for this,

362
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:37,299
and I'm sure as hell
not looking for any trouble.

363
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:39,934
Well, it's found you anyway.

364
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,270
We know you built
that Devil's Gate, Colt.

365
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,406
So you're gonna open it for us.

366
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,375
That is, if you fancy keeping
your lungs in your chest.

367
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,648
Walk away, gentlemen.

368
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:56,583
Well, I think we'd rather rip
you to ribbons, you soft...

369
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:05,760
Ah, that's a shame.

370
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,595
A damn shame.

371
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:14,903
Who's there?

372
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,805
Candygram for Mongo.

373
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:25,880
Howdy, pilgrim.

374
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:28,216
I ain't no pilgrim.

375
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:29,384
All right, back up.

376
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,125
Is that any way to, uh...

377
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:38,626
Greet your new boss?

378
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,668
Missed you at the posse
this morning.

379
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,504
I was a one-man wolf pack,
thanks to you.

380
00:24:51,107 --> 00:24:52,941
What's going on here?

381
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:54,442
Going to visit my sister.

382
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,778
- Well, she'll have to wait.
- But if I don't...

383
00:24:56,846 --> 00:24:59,114
Finch said he was coming back
for the former Sheriff...

384
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:02,016
Judge Mortimer...

385
00:25:03,052 --> 00:25:04,352
and you.

386
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:07,589
That's two down and one to go.

387
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:09,557
Then just let me go!

388
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,493
You really think
you can outrun him?

389
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,761
He is going to <i>kill</i> you.

390
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:14,295
Unless...

391
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:18,299
Unless what?

392
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:20,101
Unless we gank him first.

393
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:22,370
"Gank"?
What's "gank"?

394
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,439
Mister, you're crazy.

395
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:25,707
No way.
You're on your own.

396
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,642
I'm not asking you
to throw down with him.

397
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,177
I'm asking you
to play your part.

398
00:25:29,245 --> 00:25:31,012
- My part?
- Yeah.

399
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,880
Bait.

400
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,727
Hello?

401
00:25:57,706 --> 00:25:59,240
Okay, not a demon!
Not a demon!

402
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,910
Just...
just a hunter. Sheesh.

403
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,912
You're <i>what?</i>

404
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,247
You Samuel Colt?

405
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,984
My name is Sam Winchester.

406
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:14,556
I'm... I'm a hunter
from the year 2011.

407
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,927
Prove it.

408
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:31,639
All right.

409
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,144
A-all right?

410
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:39,013
That's... uh, that's it?

411
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:42,050
Well, when you've done this
job as long as I have...

412
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,955
...a giant from the future
with some magic brick

413
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,591
doesn't exactly
give you the vapors.

414
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,595
I need your help
killing a Phoenix.

415
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:57,465
A Phoenix? They exist?

416
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,934
Well, you shoot one
in about three hours.

417
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:01,903
If you say so.

418
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:03,304
I don't.

419
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,273
<i>You</i> do.

420
00:27:08,811 --> 00:27:10,378
That's...

421
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,750
I'm either too drunk
or not drunk enough.

422
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,490
So what is it
I'm about to exactly do?

423
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,225
Well, the Phoenix
is in Sunrise,

424
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:26,060
so, uh, if we leave now,
you can...

425
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:27,495
I appreciate your situation,

426
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,764
but I'm not gonna be
of any help to you.

427
00:27:29,832 --> 00:27:31,032
I'm booked.

428
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,800
Right, but... but
you say right here...

429
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:35,236
Don't believe
everything that you read.

430
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:36,404
But you're a <i>hunter.</i>

431
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,374
Retired.

432
00:27:39,441 --> 00:27:41,576
- There's no such thing.
- I'm out.

433
00:27:41,644 --> 00:27:43,945
There is
<i>no</i> getting out.

434
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:47,148
Look, for what it's worth,
in my time, you're a hero.

435
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:48,650
- Me?
- Yes, sir.

436
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,554
Now, look, we... we <i>need</i>
to kill this Phoenix.

437
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:53,988
Its ashes are the only thing

438
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:55,924
that can kill
the monster I'm hunting.

439
00:27:55,991 --> 00:27:58,992
So stow your crap
for a few hours, and let's go.

440
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:02,630
We got to go now.

441
00:28:02,698 --> 00:28:05,433
So, either you're coming
with me, or I need the gun.

442
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:07,669
What gun?

443
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:09,003
<i>The</i> gun.

444
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,940
Oh, that gun.

445
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:14,108
I lost it in a game of Stud.

446
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,147
You're lying.

447
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:20,315
Am I?

448
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:24,586
Now, that doesn't
sound like me.

449
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:26,521
You shot a couple of demons
with it less than an hour ago.

450
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:28,156
How do you figure?

451
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:31,559
Two pairs of bootprints.

452
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,796
Cabin reeks of sulfur.

453
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:36,464
Not bad.

454
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:41,769
You don't want it.

455
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:44,105
It's a curse.
Believe me.

456
00:28:44,173 --> 00:28:45,907
Great. Then let me
take it off your hands.

457
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,809
You go put on a few more miles
and come back,

458
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,143
and we'll talk.

459
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:51,412
Trust me,
I've got plenty of mileage.

460
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,415
I'm doing you a favor.
Believe me.

461
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,284
So, what?

462
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:58,852
You can really just sit there?

463
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:05,026
I've given my whole life
to this.

464
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:06,461
I'm done.

465
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:08,262
- So it doesn't matter what happens.
- No, it doesn't.

466
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,732
So everything you did,
it all means nothing?

467
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:15,269
Give me the gun.

468
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,519
Cass, you... you like you went
12 rounds with truckasaurus.

469
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:32,854
What happened?

470
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:34,889
I was, uh...

471
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:36,324
I was betrayed.

472
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:38,426
Rachel, uh...

473
00:29:38,494 --> 00:29:40,294
Raphael...

474
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,031
He corrupted her.
She turned on me.

475
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:44,632
Sorry.

476
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,768
Girl was a real... peach.

477
00:29:46,835 --> 00:29:48,803
She's... dead.

478
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:52,473
I... was wounded.

479
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,275
I needed... safety.

480
00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:55,476
Thank you.

481
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,645
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

482
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:58,780
Hey.

483
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:02,417
What's with the finger painting?

484
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,786
It's a warding symbol
against angels.

485
00:30:04,853 --> 00:30:07,055
How bad's it hurt?

486
00:30:07,122 --> 00:30:08,790
I'll heal.

487
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:10,591
Well, good...

488
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,160
'Cause we got less than an hour

489
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,228
before you pick up the kids
at Frontierland.

490
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:16,230
I can't.

491
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:18,599
Come again?

492
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:23,237
This fight...

493
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,706
drained me.

494
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:26,441
Well, if you're up on blocks,

495
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:29,177
then call in another halo
who can get the job done.

496
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,978
I can't.

497
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:33,481
Well, there's got to be something
that can juice you up.

498
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,450
A spell... <i>something.</i>

499
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:37,952
There is one thing
that might work, but...

500
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,488
it's extremely dangerous.

501
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:41,956
Shocker.

502
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:43,591
So, lay it on me.

503
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:45,393
It's your soul.

504
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:47,295
What do you want me to do?

505
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:49,931
Make another deal?
Seal it with a kiss?

506
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:56,370
I need you to let me touch it.

507
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:00,074
Touch it?

508
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:03,644
The human soul...
it's pure... energy.

509
00:31:03,712 --> 00:31:05,379
If I can siphon
some of that off,

510
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,482
I-I might be able
to bring Sam and Dean back.

511
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:08,850
And the catch is...?

512
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,651
Doing this is like...

513
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:13,821
putting your hand
in a nuclear reactor.

514
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:16,290
I have to do it very gingerly.

515
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:18,559
Or...?

516
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:22,463
Or you'll explode.

517
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,466
Well.

518
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:30,772
Keep both hands on the wheel.

519
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,140
Let's do this.

520
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,490
Never been late
in your damn life, Sam,

521
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:43,226
and now you're dragging ass.

522
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:45,461
So this is your big plan, huh?

523
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,231
Just let me rot in here
till Finch comes?

524
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:49,866
Pretty much.

525
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:51,734
Why's he gunning for you,
anyway?

526
00:31:51,802 --> 00:31:54,036
I guess you missed the part
where we hung him?

527
00:32:00,777 --> 00:32:04,280
No, I'm thinking to a thing like
Finch, that's no big whoop.

528
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:06,649
He would've just blown town,
but he came back.

529
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:07,750
That seems personal.

530
00:32:07,818 --> 00:32:08,951
I'll tell you what...

531
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:10,620
you let me out of here,
and we'll talk.

532
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:12,388
No can do.

533
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,599
Open up that cell.

534
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:24,767
Open it yourself.

535
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:27,904
You melt people's faces off.

536
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:30,039
I'll bet you got the juice
to tear that apart easy, don't you?

537
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:34,944
Unless you can't.

538
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:39,015
Just like you couldn't
break those cuffs

539
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,283
when they strung you up.

540
00:32:42,686 --> 00:32:44,487
Aah.

541
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:45,922
Iron shackles...

542
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:50,293
...iron bars, iron nail.

543
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,761
See a pattern?

544
00:32:51,828 --> 00:32:54,297
Don't worry. Most creatures
I meet can't get it up for iron.

545
00:32:54,364 --> 00:32:56,632
It's a common monster problem.

546
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,067
So you're a hunter.

547
00:32:58,135 --> 00:33:00,202
Slash sheriff.

548
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,305
You know
what this son of a bitch did?

549
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:06,842
Do tell.

550
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,578
I was married to a woman.

551
00:33:09,646 --> 00:33:10,980
Good woman... human.

552
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:14,517
We lived outside of town,
didn't bother anyone.

553
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:16,919
Sure, freak with
a heart of gold.

554
00:33:16,987 --> 00:33:19,221
You want
to call me "monster," fine.

555
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:24,260
But all we did
was go into town.

556
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:26,028
I go into the bank
for five minutes.

557
00:33:26,096 --> 00:33:27,363
I come out, she's gone.

558
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:29,298
And then I heard her scream.

559
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:34,870
This... man

560
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:37,073
had her pinned in the alley.

561
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,642
I go to stop him,
he pulls his gun,

562
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,044
shoots me, then her.

563
00:33:43,914 --> 00:33:47,116
She died in my arms.

564
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,826
'Course, I don't die.

565
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,296
The shots brought the Sheriff.

566
00:34:00,364 --> 00:34:02,198
Next thing I know, I'm in iron.

567
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,404
That's why I want him
just where he is...

568
00:34:08,472 --> 00:34:11,273
trapped, scared.

569
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,476
I saved the best for last.

570
00:34:13,543 --> 00:34:14,710
Is that true?

571
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:21,984
So tell me...

572
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:24,020
are you <i>really</i>
willing to die

573
00:34:24,087 --> 00:34:26,255
to protect this piece of filth?

574
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:27,990
Honestly, I could
care less about him.

575
00:34:28,058 --> 00:34:29,792
- He's a dick and a coward.
- Hey!

576
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,160
But this ain't about him.

577
00:34:31,228 --> 00:34:32,561
I know what you are.

578
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:34,730
Really?

579
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:36,565
Yeah.

580
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:39,268
So...
I got to kill you.

581
00:34:39,336 --> 00:34:41,937
Well, if you know what I am,
then you know you can't.

582
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:52,081
Wow, I should've
seen that coming.

583
00:35:24,014 --> 00:35:25,081
Dean!

584
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,785
Sam, come on, come on!

585
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:31,520
Hey, where's Colt?

586
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:32,721
- He's not coming.
- What?!

587
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:34,857
But he sent this.

588
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:35,925
Ohh.

589
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:37,760
Hello, beautiful.

590
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:40,563
All right.

591
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,564
- Come on. Go!
- Yeah.

592
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:44,567
Are you sure?

593
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:45,901
Well, we can't just

594
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:48,471
strand those idjits
in Deadwood, can we?

595
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:50,306
The risks...

596
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:53,609
Just... don't explode me.

597
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,320
Get out here, Finch!

598
00:36:06,022 --> 00:36:07,923
What are you doing?!

599
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,696
Come on!
Let's do this!

600
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:24,206
So, this is
how you want to die.

601
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:28,110
Fine.

602
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:34,410
Yippee-ki-yay, mother...

603
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,920
Dean!

604
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:46,589
The ashes!

605
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:11,589
You gotta send us back.

606
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,635
Dean, look at him.
He's fried.

607
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:19,771
I never want to do that again.

608
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,074
Bobby, you...

609
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:24,109
I'm still kickin',
Annie Oakley.

610
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,678
Be back good as new in...

611
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:29,047
a decade or two.

612
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:30,816
And we screwed the pooch.

613
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:33,018
Bobby, I'm sorry.

614
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,498
Is there a Sam Winchester here?

615
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:49,501
Who's asking?

616
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:51,136
Look, this is nuts...

617
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,672
me and a couple guys
made a bet.

618
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,608
So... this thing's been laying
around the office since...

619
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:59,144
ever!?

620
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,581
Uh, with a note on it
saying to bring it here today.

621
00:39:02,649 --> 00:39:05,250
It's from a-a Samuel Colt?

622
00:39:11,324 --> 00:39:13,959
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
that's... that's mine.

623
00:39:14,027 --> 00:39:15,093
Great. Thanks.

624
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:16,695
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

625
00:39:47,794 --> 00:39:50,195
"Dear Sam,
I got this address and date

626
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,797
"off your thingamajig,

627
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:55,367
"and I thought the enclosed
might come in handy.

628
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,603
Regards,
Samuel Colt."

629
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,647
Is that what I think it is?

630
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:10,782
Ashes of a Phoenix.

631
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:14,086
You know what this means?

632
00:40:14,153 --> 00:40:16,955
Yeah, I didn't get
a "soulonoscopy" for nothing.

633
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:18,490
Yes.

634
00:40:18,558 --> 00:40:22,160
And... it means
we take the fight to her.

635
00:40:33,663 --> 00:40:35,539
