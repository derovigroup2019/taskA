1
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:04,648
Angels got to
have something to do, right,

2
00:00:04,715 --> 00:00:06,016
now that
we're post-apocalypse?

3
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:07,817
Raphael and his followers,

4
00:00:07,885 --> 00:00:09,119
they want him to rule Heaven.

5
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:10,821
I...
and many others...

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:13,524
the <i>last</i> thing we want
is to let him take over.

7
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:14,758
You're talking civil war.

8
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:15,659
Balthazar.

9
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:17,228
It's so good to see you.

10
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:19,296
You stole the Staff of Moses.

11
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:21,532
I stole a <i>lot</i> of things.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,501
- I need the weapons.
- Don't ask <i>that.</i>

13
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,424
If we can beat Raphael,
we can end this!

14
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:26,916
Tell, uh, Raphael...

15
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,002
...to bite me.

16
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:31,804
Hey!

17
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:34,006
No.

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,810
Until next time.

19
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:38,894
I've got to make a call.

20
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,145
I got a cell you can use.

21
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:41,480
It's not that kind of call.

22
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:42,714
Ugh!

23
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:46,685
Yes, father.

24
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:47,552
Ruby?

25
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:50,072
Stop it!

26
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:51,156
Good to see you again, Dean.

27
00:00:51,224 --> 00:00:52,391
She's a demon, Sam, period.

28
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:54,577
They want us dead.
We want them dead.

29
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:57,062
Look what she did to you!
She's poison, Sam!

30
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:14,679
Where's Bobby?

31
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:17,216
In town, supply run.

32
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,801
In <i>this?</i>

33
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:20,052
Yeah, man's a hero.

34
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:21,887
We were officially
out of hunter's helper.

35
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:26,574
Hello, boys.

36
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:30,529
You've seen
"The Godfather," right?

37
00:01:30,596 --> 00:01:31,730
Balthazar...

38
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:33,449
You know, the end,
where Michael Corleone

39
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:34,900
sends his men
to kill his enemies

40
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:35,901
in one big, bloody swoop?

41
00:01:37,404 --> 00:01:38,988
Hey!

42
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,106
"Dead sea brine."
Good, good, good.

43
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:43,108
You know, Moe Greene
gets it in the eye,

44
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,077
and Don Cuneo gets it
in the revolving door?

45
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:47,211
I said "hey."

46
00:01:48,248 --> 00:01:50,231
You did.
Twice.

47
00:01:50,283 --> 00:01:52,500
Good for you.

48
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,671
Blood of lamb.
Blood of lamb.

49
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:57,506
Beer, cold pizza.

50
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,125
Blood of lamb. Yes!

51
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:01,793
Blood of lamb!

52
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:03,562
Why are you talking
about "The Godfather"?

53
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:06,315
Because we're in it...
right now, tonight.

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,934
And in the role
of Michael Corleone...

55
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:11,186
the Archangel Raphael.

56
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,907
You mind telling us
what you mean?

57
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,977
No, no, no, no.

58
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:20,479
No, no, no, no.

59
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:25,534
Yes.

60
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:28,921
Bone of a lesser Saint.

61
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:31,623
This vertebra will do
very nicely.

62
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:36,045
Your Mr. Singer
does keep a <i>beautiful</i> pantry.

63
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,296
Wait, Raphael is after <i>you?</i>

64
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:38,997
Raphael is after us all.

65
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,717
You see, he's consolidated
his strength.

66
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:44,219
And now he's on the move.

67
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:46,171
- And where's Cass?
- Oh, Cassie?

68
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:49,858
He is deep,
<i>deep</i> underground.

69
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:53,512
So, good old Raffy
put out a hit list

70
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:55,898
on every last Samaritan
who helped our dear Cass...

71
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:57,783
including both of you.

72
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,652
And so much more importantly,
me.

73
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:04,873
See, he wants to draw Cass
out in the open.

74
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,525
And you expect us
to just believe you?

75
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:07,710
Oh, don't.

76
00:03:07,794 --> 00:03:09,628
You'll go where I throw you
either way.

77
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:10,879
What's that supposed to mean?

78
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:15,134
That's all the time
we have, gentlemen.

79
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:19,972
Where is it?

80
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,473
- Whoa.
- What happened there?

81
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,727
Oh. Garish, I know.

82
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:27,913
You see, Uncle Raffy sent
one of his nastiest to handle me.

83
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:29,431
I'm flattered, actually.

84
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:31,183
And down a lung at the moment,

85
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:32,484
but that's all right.

86
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:35,154
Oh, here's for you.

87
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:36,855
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Run with it.

88
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:45,831
Virgil!

89
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:47,499
I said, <i>run!</i>

90
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:53,172
Cut!

91
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,960
Real good solid fall.
Way to go.

92
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:00,045
Jared, Jensen! Outstanding!

93
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:01,380
That was just great.

94
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:04,833
"Supernatural,"
scene one echo, take one.

95
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,852
Tail slate. Marker!

96
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,422
 Season 6 Episode 15
"The French Mistake"

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,868
So... no angels?

98
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:25,937
No angels, I think.

99
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:30,742
But that was great!

100
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:32,461
It's not a problem with the stunt.

101
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:35,631
It's a problem
with the... signal.

102
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:37,049
Should we be killing anybody?

103
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:38,500
Interference.

104
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:40,502
- I don't think so.
- Well, how much did we get?

105
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:42,254
- Running?
- About half.

106
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:44,306
- Where?
- Gets us right up to where they...

107
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,142
Just <i>before</i>
<i>they hit the window.</i>

108
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:49,478
You know, the part
where they hit the window

109
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:50,929
was the good part.

110
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,182
Well, we can clean up,
reset the window,

111
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:54,966
takes about 95 minutes,
basically.

112
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:57,102
So, we'd have to
blow off the scene

113
00:04:57,153 --> 00:05:00,472
where they sit on the Impala
and talk about their feelings.

114
00:05:00,523 --> 00:05:01,490
Ha. Right.

115
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:02,991
You answer the hate mail.

116
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:06,111
Or we could have them
fly at the window,

117
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:07,663
then freeze frame.

118
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:09,781
Then cut to black, act out.

119
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,033
Freeze frame.

120
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,621
Um... yeah.

121
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:16,872
Freeze frame.

122
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,593
Serviceable.

123
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:26,765
Fine.

124
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:28,717
Whatever.

125
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:32,187
Season Six.

126
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:33,472
Moving on.

127
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:35,641
Moving on!

128
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:37,643
That's a wrap
on Jared and Jensen!

129
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:39,061
W... who the hell are...

130
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:42,714
Jared! Three minutes, okay?
Great.

131
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:45,450
Where are we going?

132
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:46,869
Jensen, there you are!

133
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:48,871
Let's just get you
in the chair.

134
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:49,872
"The chair"?

135
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:51,156
Okay, hon,

136
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:55,711
we're just gonna get
this makeup off your face.

137
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:57,496
Wha...

138
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:59,081
I'm not wearing any ma...

139
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:02,885
Oh, crap!

140
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:04,553
I'm a painted whore!

141
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:06,138
Trish Evian here

142
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:09,040
with Jared Padalecki
from TV's "Supernatural."

143
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:13,979
So, Jared, Season Six.

144
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,049
What?

145
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:19,518
You beat the Devil,
lost your soul,

146
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,103
and got it back again.

147
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:24,438
So tell us, what's next
for Sam Winchester?

148
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:28,393
Look, I... I... I really don't...

149
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:30,728
Oh, and if you could include
the question in your answer?

150
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:32,364
Thanks.

151
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:40,038
Hey.

152
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:42,574
Dude, they put
freakin' makeup on us!

153
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,009
Those bastards!

154
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:45,627
- Look, I think I know what this is.
- Okay. What?

155
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:47,095
- It's a TV show.
- You think?

156
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,464
Yeah. I mean, here...
wherever "here" is,

157
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:52,050
this... this twilight zone
Balthazar zapped us into.

158
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:55,304
For whatever reason,
our life is a TV show.

159
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,106
- Why?
- I don't know.

160
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:00,309
No, seriously. Why?
Why would anybody want to watch our lives?

161
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:02,728
Well, I mean, according to that
interviewer, not very many people do.

162
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:04,947
Look, I'm not saying
it makes sense.

163
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:07,599
I'm just saying, we...
we landed in some dimension

164
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,151
where you're Jensen Ackles,

165
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:11,737
and I'm something
called a "Jared Padalecki."

166
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,121
So what, now you're <i>Polish?</i>

167
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:15,939
Is any of this
making any sense to you?

168
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:23,665
Oh, hey.

169
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,450
Least my baby made it.

170
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:28,553
Hey.

171
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:30,806
Hey! What...

172
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:39,982
I feel sick.

173
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,650
I'm gonna be sick.

174
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:44,969
I want to go home.

175
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:47,522
I feel like this whole place
is bad-touching me.

176
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:49,474
Yeah, I know.
Me too.

177
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,243
So, what do you think?
Cass?

178
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,362
He's our best shot,
if he's still alive.

179
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:58,116
Dear Castiel,

180
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:01,753
who art maybe running his ass
away from heaven,

181
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:04,589
we pray that
you have your ears on.

182
00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:06,291
So...

183
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:08,293
breaker, breaker...

184
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:14,433
Cass? Cass!
Hey, Cass!

185
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,718
Oh, thank God.

186
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:17,969
What is all this, huh?

187
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:20,504
W... w... what did
Balthazar do to us?

188
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:25,644
To keep you
out of Virgil's reach,

189
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:27,396
he's cast you
into an alternate reality,

190
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,615
a universe similar to ours
in most respects

191
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,684
yet dramatically different
in others.

192
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:35,871
Like... like bizarro earth,
right?

193
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:38,907
Except instead
of having Bizarro Superman,

194
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,792
we get this clown factory.

195
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,911
Um...

196
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:44,162
Yeah, well...

197
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:46,331
Anyway, no time to explain.

198
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:48,467
- Do you have the key?
- Yeah.

199
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:51,586
So, uh, what does
this thing do, anyway?

200
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:53,138
It opens a room.

201
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:54,389
What's in the room?

202
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:56,675
Every weapon Balthazar
stole from Heaven.

203
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:58,510
He gave it to <i>us?</i>

204
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,979
To keep it safe
until I could reach you.

205
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:04,015
With those weapons, I have
a chance to rally my forces.

206
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,384
Oh. Okay, good. Yeah.

207
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:09,554
So, now, uh, what's the deal
with all this TV crap?

208
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:10,522
Pardon?

209
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:12,157
Yeah. Amen, Padaleski.

210
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:13,442
- Uh, "lecki."
- What?

211
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:14,659
Lecki. Pretty sure.

212
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:16,411
Man.

213
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:18,280
- Did they put out new pages?
- New what?

214
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:19,498
I mean, is this some kind
of cosmic joke?

215
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:20,916
Yeah, 'cause if it is,
it's stupid,

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,167
- and we don't get it.
- Yeah.

217
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:23,568
Are you guys okay?

218
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,571
Give me that.

219
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:28,123
What is...

220
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:30,074
these are words in a script.

221
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:32,461
- This isn't Cass.
- Dude, <i>look</i> at him.

222
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:34,546
You guys want
to run lines, or...?

223
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:35,714
His name's Misha.

224
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:36,882
<i>Misha?</i>

225
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:37,966
Oh, wow.

226
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,218
Just... great.

227
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,420
Misha? Jensen?

228
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:44,272
What's up with the names
around here?

229
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:46,141
You guys!

230
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:48,310
You really punked me!

231
00:09:51,263 --> 00:09:53,031
I'm totally
gonna Tweet this one.

232
00:09:55,952 --> 00:10:00,071
"Hola, mishamigos.

233
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:02,073
J-squared...

234
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,126
got me good."

235
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,745
I just want to dig my finger
in my brain and scratch

236
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,279
until we're back in Kansas.

237
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:11,616
"Really...
starting to feel...

238
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,553
like one of the guys."

239
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,555
Hey.

240
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:18,722
"J. Ackles."

241
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:22,177
- That's fake me!
- Yeah.

242
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,229
This must be fake mine.

243
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:32,571
Dude, I have a helicopter!

244
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:34,072
Oh.

245
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,359
All right, who puts a 300-gallon
aquarium in their trailer?

246
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:39,327
Apparently, Jensen Ackles.

247
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:40,745
Huh.

248
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:43,999
All right, here we go.
Let's see who this guy is.

249
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,750
Well, he's not a hunter,

250
00:10:45,818 --> 00:10:47,536
but he plays one on TV.

251
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,090
Oh.

252
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:54,176
Come on.

253
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:57,596
Look at these male-modelin'
sons of bitches.

254
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,464
Nice "Blue Steel," Sam.

255
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:01,349
Hey. Apparently, it's our job.

256
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:04,469
All right, uh, here goes.

257
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,337
Um... it says
you're from Texas.

258
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,356
- Really?
- Yeah.

259
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:09,774
And, uh...

260
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:12,027
Oh.

261
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:13,845
Says you were on a soap opera.

262
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:16,898
What?

263
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:18,349
<i>If I didn't have cancer,</i>

264
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:22,854
<i>and I wasn't married,</i>
<i>and I had plenty of money...</i>

265
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:24,789
<i>would you... would you want</i>
<i>to run away with me?</i>

266
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:26,625
<i>Money?</i>

267
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:28,526
<i>What, you think I really care</i>
<i>about money, Nicole?</i>

268
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:29,828
<i>I care that you're healthy.</i>

269
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,696
<i>Well, I'm no quitter, Eric.</i>

270
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:32,881
<i>I... I...</i>

271
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:34,633
Don't like this universe, Sammy.

272
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,384
We need to get out
of this universe.

273
00:11:36,469 --> 00:11:37,552
Yeah. No argument here.

274
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:39,137
But I don't think our...
our prayers

275
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:40,422
are reaching Cass.

276
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:41,556
Or the <i>real</i> Cass.

277
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:42,974
Well, I agree.

278
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:45,427
I think we are definitely
out of, uh, soul-phone range.

279
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:47,178
But...

280
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,347
What?

281
00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:51,215
If we can reverse
Balthazar's spell...

282
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:53,652
I watched every move.

283
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:57,239
We just, uh,
get the ingredients, right,

284
00:11:57,323 --> 00:12:00,358
get back to that same window,
and...

285
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:05,130
...there's no place
like home.

286
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:08,950
Backbone of a lesser Saint.

287
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:10,568
Got it.

288
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,953
Uh...

289
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:14,572
It's rubber.

290
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:16,407
Check this out.

291
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:23,515
Hey, look. It's fake.

292
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:26,217
It's all fake!

293
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:30,922
Well, at least they're <i>talking</i>
to each other.

294
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:33,725
What are we supposed to do
with this crap?

295
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:35,360
'Course everything is fake.

296
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:37,195
We're on a film set.

297
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:39,064
We got to get back
to the real world.

298
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:40,565
Yeah, now you're talking.

299
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,874
All right, we go round up
the genuine articles,

300
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:51,442
bring 'em here for the spell.

301
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:54,412
What the hell is going on?

302
00:12:54,463 --> 00:12:56,331
What is wrong with this thing?

303
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:57,832
- Mr. Ackles! Mr. Ackles, please!
- Uh, Dean?

304
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,167
God, Mr. Ackles, please!

305
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:01,303
- Dean, it's not the Impala.
- Please!

306
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:02,470
Stop.

307
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:03,888
- You think?
- Please!

308
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:05,557
It's a frigging prop!

309
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:07,291
Just like everything else.

310
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:09,511
Oh, thank you.

311
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:12,147
Thank you.
Thank you so much for...

312
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:15,016
How the hell are we supposed to
get out of here?

313
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:19,521
You know whereabouts
you want me to drop you off?

314
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:21,406
Jensen?

315
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:24,993
Me? Yes.

316
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:30,165
I... I'll just tag along
with, uh...

317
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:31,816
- Jared. Jared.
- ...Jared here.

318
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:33,785
Huh. Since when
are you guys talking?

319
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:35,754
Yeah, uh, y... you know
what, Clint, uh...

320
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:37,205
Uh, uh, Clif.

321
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:39,841
Y... yeah.
Yeah, of course.

322
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:42,043
Clif. Obviously.

323
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:43,828
Um, so, uh, I think we're gonna

324
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,297
go back to my place
a... and do some...

325
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:47,766
work.

326
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,167
Work on our acting.

327
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:51,102
- Yeah.
- For our characters.

328
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,220
- For the show.
- Yeah.

329
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:53,388
All right.

330
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:55,223
Where the hell are we, anyway?

331
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:05,015
Dude, we're not even
in America.

332
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,361
Nice modest digs, Jay-Z.

333
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:21,082
Wow.

334
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:23,367
I must be the <i>star</i>
<i>of this thing.</i>

335
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,003
Yeah, right.

336
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:28,306
Check it out.

337
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,376
What am I, Dracula?

338
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,102
George Hamilton Dracula.

339
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:42,437
Oh.

340
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:44,689
Now we're talking.

341
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,620
Dude, you have a <i>camel</i>
<i>in your backyard.</i>

342
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:01,790
It's an Alpaca, dumb-ass.

343
00:15:03,426 --> 00:15:04,876
Ruby?

344
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,771
"Ruby." Right.

345
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:18,556
That one <i>never</i> gets old.

346
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,442
How was work today, hon?

347
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:32,850
Wait.

348
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,501
You and Ruby?

349
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,300
Do you honestly think
that's <i>funny,</i> Jensen?

350
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,770
Right.

351
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:44,506
Right.
'Cause you're not Ruby.

352
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:45,691
You...

353
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:48,010
I mean, how could you be?

354
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:49,695
You...

355
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,616
Of course! You are the lovely
actress who plays Ruby.

356
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:58,154
And you are, uh, in...

357
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:00,623
Jared's house,

358
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,409
uh, because you two are...

359
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,164
...married!

360
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:11,700
You <i>married</i> fake Ruby?

361
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,704
What are you doing?

362
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:16,806
Work.

363
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:18,557
Work.

364
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:21,310
Yeah, just, uh,
thought I'd pop in, say "hey."

365
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:23,429
Hey.

366
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:25,231
Uh, and... and...
and maybe run some lines.

367
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:26,432
It's...

368
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:28,517
You've never even
been to our house.

369
00:16:31,571 --> 00:16:33,388
Well, now that I know
there's an Alpaca out back,

370
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,241
I'm definitely coming back.

371
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:37,493
Well, Alpacas
<i>are</i> the greenest animal.

372
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,329
Right. Right.

373
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:41,997
That is so important.

374
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,753
Well, there's that thing
I have to get to.

375
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:50,906
Oh, yeah. Of course, yeah.
The thing.

376
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:53,709
The International Otter
Adoption Charity dinner?

377
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,961
Oh.

378
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,963
Okay, well...

379
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:04,470
Well, I'm glad you two
are talking, anyway.

380
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:05,805
Yeah.

381
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:13,496
Well, looks like
you did all right.

382
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:14,980
Yeah.

383
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:16,732
Yeah.

384
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,601
I should figure out her name.

385
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,172
"Wrist bone of Saint
and holy reliquary.

386
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,275
Museum-quality,
from diocese in Oaxaca."

387
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:28,444
- Looks legit.
- All right.

388
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:30,296
Auction house
is in Mexico City.

389
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,997
We could be there
day after tomorrow.

390
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:34,350
We, uh, case it, yank it, be back
here by the end of the week.

391
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,485
Or we could just buy it.

392
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:38,721
What?! Dude, that thing's
over a hundred thou...

393
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:42,007
Hello, Jared Padalecki.

394
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:46,629
<i>Cubrir? a su amigo</i>
<i>en la aduana.</i>

395
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:48,297
<i>?No?</i>

396
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,098
<i>Bueno.</i>

397
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:52,101
Triple rush. <i>No problemo.</i>

398
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:54,603
Because money is no ob...

399
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:56,772
This baby's maxed.

400
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:58,073
Wow.

401
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:00,192
They said it should be
at the airport

402
00:18:00,277 --> 00:18:01,760
first thing in the morning.

403
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:04,413
Money, man.

404
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,949
There is nothing like it.

405
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:10,870
All right.

406
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:12,037
Couch.

407
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:13,756
TV star.

408
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:16,008
Beauty rest.

409
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:17,760
Ahh.

410
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:29,338
Hey!

411
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:31,840
Hey. Hi.

412
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:35,361
Hi, uh, Gen...
Genevieve.

413
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:36,562
- Gen?
- Gen.

414
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:38,230
Gen. Of course. Yeah.

415
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:40,232
Um, so, h...

416
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:42,318
how was the...

417
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:43,652
Otter thing?

418
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:44,703
It was good.

419
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:45,788
Yeah?

420
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:47,623
Everybody missed you there.

421
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,291
Oh. Wow. Wow.

422
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,576
I bet.

423
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,828
So... so listen,
I... I got to ask you a question.

424
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,696
Do you remember, uh, uh,

425
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:57,583
year before last,
all those disasters?

426
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,835
- Disasters?
- Yeah.

427
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:02,221
Yeah, yeah, the whole
earthquake spike.

428
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:04,890
You know, the...
the 9.2 in Rome?

429
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:08,644
I mean, the...
the 8.5 outside Boston?

430
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:11,764
The whole east/west
Tsunami chain?

431
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:13,816
Yes.

432
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:16,435
I remember all of those

433
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:19,772
from last season on your show.

434
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:22,324
No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:23,576
I... I know.
I know.

436
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,727
That... that's what I mean.
That's what I was... talking about.

437
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:30,416
You have been Sam Winchester
way too long.

438
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:45,347
Thanks.

439
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,350
So I don't mean to pry,
but, uh,

440
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:50,135
why are we picking up
packages at 8:00 a.m.

441
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:51,604
that haven't
cleared customs yet?

442
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:54,023
Just saving time.

443
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,444
All right, here we go.

444
00:19:58,528 --> 00:19:59,778
We're not doing
anything illegal, are we?

445
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:02,564
Would it make you feel better
if we said no?

446
00:20:02,863 --> 00:20:04,564
No!

447
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,576
Whoa. What?

448
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:17,129
We finish today in 12 hours
if it kills us all.

449
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:19,748
Get "A" and "B" Cam
for scene 12.

450
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,133
What is this?

451
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:24,336
Here for the first run-through,
before anyone else?

452
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,788
Dedication.

453
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,641
Uh, can I talk to you
for a second?

454
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:32,344
Um, we're gonna need
the, uh, set cleared

455
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:35,564
for... safe side,
an hour or so.

456
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:37,232
You need it cleared.

457
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,350
Yeah.

458
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:40,436
Yeah. Me and, um...

459
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:43,739
Jared were gonna do
some actor stuff.

460
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:46,825
Jensen,

461
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,496
we're thrilled to see you
collaborating so creatively.

462
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,948
And your enthusiasm
is refreshing.

463
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:55,034
Dean Cain was like that
on "Lois,"

464
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,752
and that man's a real actor.

465
00:20:58,588 --> 00:20:59,672
And we will clear this set

466
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:02,591
exactly when we shoot
the 2 3/8 pages

467
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:05,660
we are scheduled to shoot
on this set.

468
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:08,797
So you do your "actor stuff"

469
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:12,000
and we'll do
our "camera stuff" and, uh...

470
00:21:16,856 --> 00:21:18,340
Ooh, "priority."
What's in it?

471
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:23,312
I bought
parts of a dead person.

472
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:25,814
Oh, cool.

473
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:28,484
Uh, so, bad news.

474
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:30,152
Uh...

475
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:32,371
Looks like we're gonna
have to do a little acting.

476
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:33,989
What?

477
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,859
"Supernatural" scene 36,
take 1.

478
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:39,211
Marker!

479
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,915
Action!

480
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:45,700
Balthazar is no hero.

481
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:48,971
But he knows Raphael
will never take him back.

482
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,550
Cut!

483
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:06,939
"Supernatural" scene 36,
take 8.

484
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:07,990
Marker!

485
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:12,161
Action!

486
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:14,113
Balthazar is no hero.

487
00:22:14,197 --> 00:22:17,166
But he knows Raphael
will never take him back.

488
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:32,598
Dean, grimly.

489
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:35,384
And yet, somehow you got
no problem with it.

490
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:36,084
Cut!

491
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:44,092
Action.

492
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:48,930
That's because...

493
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:53,869
that's because we have
no other choice.

494
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:56,588
Don't look at the camera.

495
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:57,656
What?

496
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,608
Look anywhere but the camera.

497
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:07,966
That's because
we have no other choice!

498
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:09,551
Cut!

499
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:10,586
For the love of...

500
00:23:11,304 --> 00:23:12,838
Action.

501
00:23:16,893 --> 00:23:18,010
Cut!

502
00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:21,814
If there's a key,

503
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:25,067
then there must also be a lock.

504
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:25,901
Cut.

505
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:28,237
Action.

506
00:23:29,706 --> 00:23:31,607
If there's a key...

507
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:34,910
...then there has to be a lock.

508
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:36,528
And when we find the lock,

509
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:38,113
we can get the weapons,

510
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:40,332
and then we can have
the weapons.

511
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,501
And the lock. We'll still
have the lock, I imagine,

512
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:44,503
because we've opened it, and,
of course, the initial key.

513
00:23:44,587 --> 00:23:46,255
We need to get
all three of that crap.

514
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:47,322
What?

515
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:48,590
- That's how he talks.
- Oh.

516
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,160
Do we really
need all these lines?

517
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:54,847
I mean, I... I... I... I think
we've covered it.

518
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:56,431
- Right?
- Cut!

519
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:57,933
What is happening?

520
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,668
What's happening?!

521
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:01,303
What's <i>happening?!</i>

522
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:03,722
An atrocity is happening.

523
00:24:03,806 --> 00:24:05,023
Seems like they should stop.

524
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:06,725
They can't stop.

525
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:07,943
<i>Nobody</i> stops.

526
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:11,280
Did we get anything we can use?

527
00:24:11,347 --> 00:24:15,234
Well, uh, technically,
we have them saying everything

528
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:16,851
in bits and pieces.

529
00:24:16,903 --> 00:24:19,071
Could be sort of experimental?

530
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:21,990
Whatever.

531
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,409
Season Six.

532
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:25,827
Who wrote this?

533
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:28,330
Nobody says "penultimate!"

534
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:30,082
Gun, mouth.

535
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,166
Now.

536
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:34,703
Moving on!

537
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:35,637
Thank God.

538
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:40,842
"I-M-H-O,

539
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:44,646
'J' and 'J' had a <i>late</i> one
last night."

540
00:24:45,932 --> 00:24:47,432
All right, damn it.

541
00:24:47,517 --> 00:24:49,884
We earned this.

542
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:53,405
"R-O-T-F-L-M-A-O."

543
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:55,357
Spell it out for me, please.

544
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:57,392
What is our
terror-alert level here?

545
00:24:57,443 --> 00:24:59,244
I don't know, Sera.
Orange, maybe?

546
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:01,079
They started talking
to each other.

547
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:02,748
What?!
But that's a good thing.

548
00:25:02,832 --> 00:25:04,032
Right.
I thought so.

549
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,834
But now Jensen's living
at Jared's house.

550
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:07,753
- That's it?
- Plus, Clif says they're smuggling

551
00:25:07,837 --> 00:25:09,838
- illegal stuff in from Mexico.
- That's it, Toto.

552
00:25:09,905 --> 00:25:10,923
Misha's celebrity Tweet

553
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:12,674
says it's a black-market
organ thing.

554
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:13,842
I'm betting drugs.

555
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:15,577
Anyway, as far as I can see,

556
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:18,630
I think they've lost any
shred of talent they ever had.

557
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,751
Oh, that one hurt.

558
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:24,085
Drugs.

559
00:25:26,922 --> 00:25:28,941
Maybe we did it wrong.

560
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:31,109
No.

561
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:33,028
No, that...
that spell was <i>perfect.</i>

562
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:35,314
It should have worked.

563
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:37,282
What if it can't?

564
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,768
Look, I was up all night,
looking online.

565
00:25:39,819 --> 00:25:41,653
There's no sign

566
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:43,822
that anything like
the apocalypse happened here.

567
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:45,107
<i>Ever.</i>

568
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:47,275
And as far as I can tell,

569
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:49,211
monsters, ghosts, demons...

570
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:50,629
they're all pretend.

571
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:54,049
- So nobody's hunting them?
- No hunters.

572
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:57,002
Look, maybe that's why our spell
didn't work, Dean, you know?

573
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:59,805
M... maybe here,
there's no supernatural,

574
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:00,955
no magic.

575
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:03,809
No demons, no Hell,

576
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:06,228
no Heaven, no... no God?

577
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:07,462
Something like...

578
00:26:07,513 --> 00:26:09,514
even better...

579
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,267
no angels.

580
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,481
Okay, maybe we can't
get out of, uh, you know,

581
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,598
earth number two right now,

582
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,933
but the least we can do

583
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:43,647
is get the hell out
of the Canadian part of it.

584
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:44,488
Yeah.

585
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:47,446
I hear one more conversation
about hockey, I'm gonna puke.

586
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:49,178
Wait a minute.

587
00:26:49,262 --> 00:26:50,829
This way, this way, this way.

588
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:52,131
No, no, no, no, no.
It's this way.

589
00:26:52,182 --> 00:26:53,599
It's this way!

590
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,267
No, Dean, look, I really...
I really think that we should...

591
00:26:55,335 --> 00:26:56,468
Dean!

592
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,721
You think you can run?

593
00:26:58,805 --> 00:26:59,555
No!

594
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:06,678
Sorry, dude.

595
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,664
Mojo-free zone.

596
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:13,452
No magic in the house.

597
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,737
Which makes you
nothing but a dick.

598
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:20,910
You know,
I oversee all the stunts,

599
00:27:20,994 --> 00:27:23,078
coordinate all the fights.

600
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:24,330
That's exciting.

601
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:28,133
Is that one of yours, then?

602
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:31,708
Guys!

603
00:27:34,824 --> 00:27:36,074
Not good!
Not good!

604
00:27:37,827 --> 00:27:39,411
No, no, no, no!

605
00:27:39,462 --> 00:27:40,545
Stop!
You don't understand!

606
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:41,630
No, no, no!

607
00:27:41,714 --> 00:27:43,715
You're dead, Virgil!
Virgil!

608
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,088
- I'm gonna break your friggin' neck!
- Hey!

609
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:52,390
I'm trying
to understand, Bob.

610
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:55,793
Well, uh, Sera, we don't really
understand it ourselves,

611
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:59,431
but, uh, it appears
that Jared and Jensen

612
00:27:59,482 --> 00:28:02,467
were seen beating
an extra to death.

613
00:28:02,518 --> 00:28:03,935
Huh.

614
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:05,687
This is Jim here, Sera, and
it wasn't all the way to death.

615
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,355
Only partway, so that's a plus.

616
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,607
He could definitely still run.

617
00:28:08,658 --> 00:28:10,909
And we'll certainly
follow up on that,

618
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:13,111
but I think the real issue
here, Sera,

619
00:28:13,162 --> 00:28:15,330
is that the boys appear to be

620
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:18,834
on some kind of extended
psychedelic acid trip.

621
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:20,335
Well, uh, o... okay.

622
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:23,154
Maybe it'd help if I...
I'll fly up and talk to them.

623
00:28:23,206 --> 00:28:26,424
You know, I'm not sure
Jared and Jensen...

624
00:28:26,492 --> 00:28:28,993
know who she is,
strictly speaking.

625
00:28:29,045 --> 00:28:31,546
She's, you know, new.
No offense.

626
00:28:31,614 --> 00:28:33,431
Right.

627
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:36,501
Yeah, I think what
we might need at this stage

628
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:39,304
is for Kripke
to come up himself.

629
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:41,339
He created the show.

630
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,840
They'll listen to him.

631
00:28:42,892 --> 00:28:44,693
How's that make me look?

632
00:28:44,777 --> 00:28:47,445
I'm supposed to be
running this thing.

633
00:28:47,513 --> 00:28:49,881
Besides, Eric is off
in some cabin somewhere

634
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:51,483
writing his next <i>pilot.</i>

635
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:53,785
- He sold "Octocobra"?
- Yes!

636
00:28:53,852 --> 00:28:55,620
Mother of God.

637
00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:57,372
They'll buy <i>anything.</i>

638
00:28:57,456 --> 00:28:59,207
I don't know. I mean,
Virgil broke through.

639
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:00,692
Maybe he's got a way
to get back.

640
00:29:00,743 --> 00:29:01,877
Or he has no juice here,

641
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:03,328
and now he's stuck, like us.

642
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:07,082
Yeah, either way, I want
to finish kicking his ass.

643
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:08,582
Good night, Misha.

644
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:11,386
'Night, little fella.

645
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,774
"Ever get that feeling...

646
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:37,329
someone's in the backseat?"

647
00:29:37,396 --> 00:29:38,697
Frowny face.

648
00:29:38,748 --> 00:29:39,698
Aah! Aaaah!

649
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:40,749
Aah!

650
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,167
- Drive.
- Oh.

651
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:49,407
There you are, guys!
You got a minute?

652
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:52,676
- Actually, we're... we're looking for, uh...
- For that extra you tried to kill?

653
00:29:53,078 --> 00:29:54,930
So, is it money?

654
00:29:55,014 --> 00:29:58,266
Is this the kind of act
that goes away

655
00:29:58,351 --> 00:29:59,917
if we can scare up
some coverage on a raise?

656
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:02,020
<i>More</i> money?

657
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:05,256
- You already pay these two jokers
enough as it is. - Yeah.

658
00:30:05,308 --> 00:30:07,925
'Cause I'd like to think
that over these years,

659
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:09,194
we've grown closer.

660
00:30:09,261 --> 00:30:12,197
That you don't think of me
as "Director Bob"

661
00:30:12,264 --> 00:30:14,199
or "Executive Producer
Bob Singer,"

662
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:16,368
but as "Uncle Bob."

663
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:18,069
Wait, you're kidding.

664
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,905
So, the character in the show,
Bobby Singer...

665
00:30:20,957 --> 00:30:23,274
what kind of douche-bag names
a character after himself?

666
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:24,793
Oh, that's not right.

667
00:30:24,877 --> 00:30:26,995
Okay, guys, let's begin again.

668
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,630
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

669
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:30,782
You know, I don't think Virgil
would have shagged out of here

670
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,450
- without getting his mitts on that key.
- Yeah.

671
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:35,119
Yeah, I agree.

672
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:36,588
Guys...

673
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:39,057
You can't
come to work on poppers

674
00:30:39,124 --> 00:30:41,843
and smuggle kidneys in
from Mexico

675
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:45,013
and make up your own lines
as you go!

676
00:30:45,097 --> 00:30:47,632
You <i>cannot</i>
<i>make up your own lines!</i>

677
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:50,001
Good God,
what about your careers?

678
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:51,770
You know what?
Screw our careers, Bob.

679
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:53,021
What?!

680
00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:54,656
You heard my brother.

681
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,491
That's right,
I said "brother."

682
00:30:56,575 --> 00:30:58,643
'Cause you know what, Bob?

683
00:30:58,694 --> 00:31:00,144
We're not actors.

684
00:31:00,196 --> 00:31:01,663
We're hunters.

685
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:03,281
We're the Winchesters.

686
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:05,667
Always have been,
and always will be.

687
00:31:05,751 --> 00:31:08,870
And where we're from,
people don't know who we are.

688
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:10,321
But you know what?

689
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:12,340
We mattered in that world.

690
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:15,326
In fact, we even saved
the son of a bitch once or twice.

691
00:31:15,378 --> 00:31:18,346
And yeah, okay, here, maybe
there's some... some fans

692
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:20,548
who give a crap
about this nonsense.

693
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:22,217
I wouldn't call it nonsense.

694
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:24,636
But, Bob Singer...

695
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,271
if that even is your name...

696
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:27,722
tell me this...

697
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,392
what does it all mean?

698
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:34,062
Okay. This is good.

699
00:31:34,146 --> 00:31:37,115
I mean, we've all had
our psychotic breaks, right?

700
00:31:37,182 --> 00:31:38,566
I can work with this.

701
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:39,868
Dean.

702
00:31:39,952 --> 00:31:41,453
Virgil...
I think he has the key.

703
00:31:44,022 --> 00:31:45,490
We quit.

704
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,833
Okay, okay, okay.
Easy, easy.

705
00:31:56,469 --> 00:31:57,702
How do you do it?

706
00:31:57,753 --> 00:31:58,870
Please.

707
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:00,839
Live in this grubby,
shabby desert?

708
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,257
Nothing greater
than yourselves.

709
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:03,708
Ohh.

710
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,727
Nothing but dirt when you die.

711
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:06,845
What? Aah!

712
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:07,712
Aah! Aah!

713
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:09,481
Oh, oh.

714
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:12,067
No power, no magic.

715
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:14,602
I'm so...
I'm not following you at all.

716
00:32:14,687 --> 00:32:16,020
There's no magic
in your universe!

717
00:32:16,072 --> 00:32:18,356
I'm sorry!

718
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:19,941
Please!

719
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:22,393
- Nothing but a bag of strings and pulleys.
- What?!

720
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:23,728
You should thank me
for what I'm about to do.

721
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:26,247
Why?
What are you about to do?

722
00:32:26,332 --> 00:32:27,615
I need to make
an important call.

723
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,201
I pray to God
that it even goes through.

724
00:32:37,176 --> 00:32:39,076
This is what
I've been reduced to.

725
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,383
Raphael.

726
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:56,309
Maybe if we get inside
the police dispatch system.

727
00:32:56,335 --> 00:32:58,251
Put out an A.P.B. on Virgil.

728
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:00,064
Might work,
if he stays obvious.

729
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,751
It's not like we have
a lot of time.

730
00:33:01,802 --> 00:33:03,970
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

731
00:33:04,054 --> 00:33:05,338
What?

732
00:33:05,422 --> 00:33:08,123
Misha!
He's been stabbed to death!

733
00:33:08,175 --> 00:33:09,809
- Where?
- Where?

734
00:33:09,893 --> 00:33:11,811
<i>Where?!</i>

735
00:33:30,313 --> 00:33:32,498
Yeah, yeah, Raphael.
Like the Ninja Turtle.

736
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:35,835
He was calling someone name
of Raphael, up in heaven.

737
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,205
Yeah, yeah.
That's right.

738
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:42,091
The... the scary man killed
the attractive crying man,

739
00:33:42,158 --> 00:33:44,293
and then he started to pray.

740
00:33:44,344 --> 00:33:47,830
And the strange part...

741
00:33:47,881 --> 00:33:49,182
after a while,

742
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:51,500
I s... swear I heard
this voice, answering.

743
00:33:51,552 --> 00:33:54,353
What did it say?

744
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:56,022
Well, it didn't make any sense.

745
00:33:56,106 --> 00:33:58,140
Try us.

746
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:01,394
The voice said,

747
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:04,197
"for Virgil to return tomorrow

748
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:05,898
at the place
where he crossed over,

749
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:08,451
at the time of the crossing.

750
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:10,453
And Raphael would
reach through the window

751
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,821
and take him
and the key home."

752
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:16,959
Uh, okay. Hey...

753
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:19,028
thank you.

754
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,636
Dean, if Virgil
gets back with that key,

755
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:29,922
Cass is dead,
and our world is toast.

756
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:31,390
Well, then we stop him.

757
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:34,644
I mean, how bad can an angel
with no wings be?

758
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:44,070
I'd like to see
that pump-action tactical,

759
00:34:44,154 --> 00:34:45,238
12-gauge.

760
00:34:45,322 --> 00:34:47,189
You bet.

761
00:34:49,443 --> 00:34:50,826
Nice choice.

762
00:34:53,614 --> 00:34:56,165
You really know
your ordnance, mister.

763
00:34:56,232 --> 00:34:58,251
I am the weapons keeper
of Heaven.

764
00:34:58,335 --> 00:34:59,585
Excuse me?

765
00:35:01,455 --> 00:35:02,505
It's my job.

766
00:35:12,215 --> 00:35:15,518
You know that if we drop Virgil,
get the key,

767
00:35:15,585 --> 00:35:17,252
then this might be it.

768
00:35:17,304 --> 00:35:20,273
We might be stuck here.

769
00:35:20,357 --> 00:35:24,110
No, we'll figure out
a way back.

770
00:35:24,194 --> 00:35:26,529
Yeah, you wouldn't be that
broken up if we didn't, though.

771
00:35:26,596 --> 00:35:28,364
What?

772
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:29,932
Don't be stupid.

773
00:35:32,452 --> 00:35:33,869
Well, I'm just saying.

774
00:35:33,937 --> 00:35:37,439
No Hell below us,
above us only sky.

775
00:35:37,491 --> 00:35:39,659
Dean, our friends
are back there.

776
00:35:42,546 --> 00:35:45,581
Yeah, but here,
you got a pretty good life.

777
00:35:45,632 --> 00:35:47,466
I mean, back home,
the hits have been coming

778
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:48,584
since you were 6 months old.

779
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:52,972
You got to admit,
being a... a bazillionare,

780
00:35:53,056 --> 00:35:54,724
married to Ruby,
the whole package.

781
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:56,792
It's no contest.

782
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:01,647
No, you know, you were right.

783
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:04,350
We just don't mean
the same thing here.

784
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:06,686
I mean, we're not even
<i>brothers</i> here, man.

785
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:14,577
All right, then. Let's get
our crazy show back home.

786
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:27,840
Bob, dude.
What the hell, right?

787
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:30,042
- Eric. Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

788
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:32,378
I know you're busy. It means a lot that
we can still, you know, call on you.

789
00:36:32,462 --> 00:36:34,347
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Misha, right?

790
00:36:34,431 --> 00:36:35,464
Oh, I know, I know.
It's just <i>awful!</i>

791
00:36:35,515 --> 00:36:37,383
It's totally,
totally awful. Yeah.

792
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:40,019
It got us the front page of <i>Variety,</i>
though. Did you see that?

793
00:36:40,103 --> 00:36:42,221
- Front page? Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

794
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:43,472
But tragic.

795
00:36:43,523 --> 00:36:45,558
Yeah, tragic.
That's what I was gonna say.

796
00:36:45,642 --> 00:36:47,360
How's "Octocobra"?

797
00:36:47,444 --> 00:36:49,111
Oh, I think I really
had a breakthrough.

798
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:50,896
I'll tell you all about it
over lunch, though.

799
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:52,732
I can't wait.

800
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:53,699
Yeah.

801
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:57,352
Okay, so I am just gonna
bust in their trailer,

802
00:36:57,404 --> 00:37:00,689
guns blazing, and then take care
of this whole mess and...

803
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:01,957
what's the matter?

804
00:37:02,025 --> 00:37:03,125
What?

805
00:37:03,193 --> 00:37:05,244
That guy.
I think that's the extra!

806
00:37:05,328 --> 00:37:06,495
Oh, fantastic.

807
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:08,197
We can nip this bud
right out of the gate.

808
00:37:08,248 --> 00:37:09,915
Hey, extra!

809
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,217
Over here!

810
00:37:11,301 --> 00:37:13,502
Gun! He's got a gun!

811
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,303
Noooooo!

812
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,005
I don't think we have gunfire
on the call sheet today, hmm?

813
00:37:58,581 --> 00:37:59,682
Hey!

814
00:38:17,451 --> 00:38:19,068
Dean, got it!

815
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:24,439
Raphael. Run!

816
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:36,068
You two...

817
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:37,869
have the strangest luck.

818
00:38:39,522 --> 00:38:40,739
Raphael?

819
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:45,043
Nice meatsuit.

820
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:46,545
Dude looks like a lady.

821
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:49,748
The key.

822
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,506
And that will open you a locker
at the Albany bus station.

823
00:38:57,557 --> 00:38:59,091
Really.

824
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:02,294
You see, I needed a modest decoy
to make it more convincing.

825
00:39:02,362 --> 00:39:03,629
Give me the weapons.

826
00:39:03,696 --> 00:39:05,297
Sorry, darling.
They're gone.

827
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:06,531
What?!

828
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,684
I said, too bloody late.

829
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:10,686
You see, they were
so well-hidden

830
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:13,305
that I needed time
to find them.

831
00:39:13,373 --> 00:39:14,906
So, I volunteered
these two marmosets

832
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:17,191
for a game of fetch
with Virgil.

833
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:21,163
You two were
such an adequate stick.

834
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,514
Thank you.
Thank you, boys.

835
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:24,399
You've made your last mistake.

836
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:26,251
Oh, I've got a few more
up my sleeve,

837
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:27,285
honey.

838
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:33,725
Step away
from him, Raphael.

839
00:39:34,761 --> 00:39:36,795
I have the weapons now.
Their power is with me.

840
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:43,702
Castiel.

841
00:39:45,772 --> 00:39:49,891
If you don't want to die tonight,
back off.

842
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,063
Well, Cass...

843
00:39:58,735 --> 00:40:02,119
...now that you have your sword,
try not to die by it.

844
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,710
Cass, what the hell?

845
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:14,216
Wait, you were in on this,

846
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:16,134
using us as a <i>diversion?</i>

847
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:19,588
It was Balthazar's plan.

848
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,757
I would have done
the same thing.

849
00:40:21,808 --> 00:40:23,592
That's not comforting, Cass.

850
00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:28,563
When will I be able
to make you understand?

851
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:32,234
If I lose against Raphael,
we <i>all</i> lose.

852
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:33,468
<i>Everything.</i>

853
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:35,070
Yeah, Cass.
We know the stakes.

854
00:40:35,137 --> 00:40:37,588
That's about
all you've told us!

855
00:40:39,492 --> 00:40:41,193
I'm sorry about all this.

856
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:46,381
I'll explain when I can.

857
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:50,502
Friggin' Angels.

858
00:41:08,671 --> 00:41:10,021
Solid.

859
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:11,940
It's real.

860
00:41:12,007 --> 00:41:13,341
Nice.

861
00:41:13,392 --> 00:41:14,860
Yeah.

862
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:19,848
Yeah, real, moldy,
termite-eaten home sweet home.

863
00:41:19,899 --> 00:41:22,400
Chock full of crap
that want to skin you.

864
00:41:22,485 --> 00:41:24,619
Oh, and, uh,

865
00:41:24,687 --> 00:41:26,037
we're broke again.

866
00:41:26,122 --> 00:41:27,789
Yeah.

867
00:41:27,857 --> 00:41:29,958
But, hey...

868
00:41:30,025 --> 00:41:32,260
at least we're talking.
