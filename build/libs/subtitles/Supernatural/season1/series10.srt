1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,454
Previously on Supernatural

2
00:00:01,772 --> 00:00:02,658
Sammy!

3
00:00:03,454 --> 00:00:05,635
Take your brother outside as fast as you can! Go!

4
00:00:09,632 --> 00:00:10,655
Dad's on a hunting trip.

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,722
And he hasn't been home in a few days.

6
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:17,817
This is dad's book.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,617
I think he wants us to pick up where he left off

8
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:21,775
saving people, hunting things.

9
00:00:21,844 --> 00:00:22,957
Family business.

10
00:00:23,116 --> 00:00:24,502
Do you think Mom wanted all this for us?

11
00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:25,706
I can't do this alone.

12
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:27,520
I'm driving.

13
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:16,379
Can't keep kids out of this place.

14
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:17,765
What is it anyway?

15
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:19,287
I forgot you're not a local.

16
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,469
You don't know the legend.

17
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:21,650
Legend?

18
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,768
Every town's got its stories, right?

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,836
Ours is Roosevelt asylum.

20
00:01:26,518 --> 00:01:28,790
They say it's haunted with the ghosts of the patients.

21
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:30,113
Spend the night,

22
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:32,340
spirits will drive you insane.

23
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:39,791
Hello?!

24
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:41,313
Police officers!

25
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,812
Police officers!

26
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:56,974
You tell me these kids brought bolt cutters?

27
00:01:58,092 --> 00:01:58,865
Come on.

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,024
Let's split up.

29
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:01,523
All right.

30
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:16,565
Hello?

31
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:46,356
Hello?

32
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:10,918
All right.

33
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:13,076
Come on out.

34
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:42,627
Kelly, you copy?

35
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:45,558
Jeez!

36
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:47,443
Where the hell you been?!

37
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,398
In there.

38
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:49,647
What was it? See anything?

39
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,677
No.

40
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,639
This is patrol 1 4. We are clear, we return to the station

41
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,351
Hey.

42
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,540
So, what?

43
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:34,812
You're still not talking to me?

44
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:38,814
Walt.

45
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,927
I said I was sorry about before.

46
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:42,722
How many times do I have to say it?

47
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:05,856
No, dad was in California last we heard from him.

48
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:09,128
We just thought if he comes to you for munitions,

49
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,019
maybe you've seen him in the last few weeks.

50
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:13,046
- Just call us if you hear anything.
- Okay.

51
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:14,093
Thanks.

52
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,151
Caleb hasn't heard
from him?

53
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:16,874
Nope.

54
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:19,244
Neither has Jefferson or pastor Jim.

55
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:21,215
What about the journal?
Any leads in there?

56
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,887
No. Same last time I looked.

57
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:24,458
Nothing I can make out.

58
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,170
I love the guy, but I swear
he writes like freaking Yoda.

59
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:29,667
And maybe we should call the feds,

60
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:30,865
file a missing person's out.

61
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:33,260
We talked about this. Dad would be
pissed if we put the feds on his tail.

62
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:34,407
I don't care anymore

63
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,550
After all that happened back in kansas,

64
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,573
I mean...

65
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:38,771
he should have been there, Dean.

66
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,791
You said so yourself.
You tried to call him and nothing.

67
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:41,864
I know.

68
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:43,658
I loose my cellphone.

69
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,604
You know, he could be dead
for all we know.

70
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:46,876
Don't say that.

71
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:48,723
He's not dead. He's...

72
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:51,118
He's what? He's hiding? He's busy?

73
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:58,776
I don't believe it.

74
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,323
What?

75
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,016
It's a-a text message.

76
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:08,336
It's coordinates.

77
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:12,253
You think dad was texting us?

78
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:13,747
He's given us coordinates before.

79
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:15,867
The man can barely work a toaster, Dean.

80
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:17,439
Sam, this is good news.

81
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:18,936
It means he's okay, or alive.

82
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,757
Was there a number on the caller I.D.?

83
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,005
Huh, it said "unknown."

84
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,332
Okay, well, where do the coordinates point?

85
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,655
That's the interesting part.

86
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:26,301
Rockford, Illinois.

87
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:28,469
Okay, and that's interesting how?

88
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,313
I checked the local rockford paper.
Take a look at this.

89
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:36,275
This cop, Walter Kelly,

90
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:38,371
comes home from his shift,
shoots his wife,

91
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:40,541
then puts the gun in his mouth,
blows his brains out.

92
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:42,736
Earlier that night, kelly and his partner

93
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:45,294
responded to a call
at the Roosevelt asylum.

94
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:47,888
Okay, I'm not following.
What does this have to do with us?

95
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,832
Dad earmarked the same asylum
in the journal.

96
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:52,851
Let's see.

97
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:55,171
Here.

98
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:57,890
"Seven unconfirmed sightings, two deaths"

99
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,487
till last week, at least.

100
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:01,556
I think this is where he wants us to go.

101
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:06,429
This is a job.

102
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,473
Dad wants us to work a job.

103
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:11,244
Maybe we'll meet up with him.
Maybe he's there.

104
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:12,317
Maybe he's not.

105
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:14,560
May He could be sending us there
by ourselves to hunting thing.

106
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:15,872
Who cares?

107
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:18,477
If he wants us there,
it's good enough for me.

108
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,523
This doesn't strike you as weird...

109
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:22,494
the texting,

110
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,013
- the coordinates?
- Sam.

111
00:07:24,388 --> 00:07:26,533
Dad's telling us to go somewhere.
We're going.

112
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,513
You're Daniel Gunderson,
right, you're cop?

113
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:50,461
Yeah.

114
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:52,332
I'm...

115
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,677
Nigel Tufnel

116
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:54,849
with the chicago tribune.

117
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,396
Do you mind if I ask a couple questions

118
00:07:56,397 --> 00:07:57,444
about your partner?

119
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:58,392
Yeah, I do.

120
00:07:58,393 --> 00:07:59,365
I'm just trying to have a beer here.

121
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,685
I just want to hear
the story in your words.

122
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:04,363
A week ago, my partner
was sitting in that chair,

123
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:05,910
and now he's dead.

124
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,157
Are you gonna ambush me here?

125
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:07,931
Sorry,

126
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:09,527
but I need to know what happened.

127
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:12,421
Heyn buddy! How about leaving
the poor guy alone, huh?!

128
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:15,200
The man's an officer! Why don't
you show a little respect?!

129
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:23,531
You didn't have to do that.

130
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,903
Yeah, of course I did.

131
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:26,932
That guy's a serious jerk.

132
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,028
Let me buy you a beer, huh?

133
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:30,699
Two?

134
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:35,090
Thanks.

135
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:41,603
You shoved me kind of hard
in there, buddy boy.

136
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:43,125
I had to sell it, didn't I?

137
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:44,971
It's method acting.

138
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:46,842
Huh?

139
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:48,112
Never mind.

140
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,235
What did you find out from Gunderson?

141
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:51,006
So, Walter Kelly was a good cop.

142
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,827
Head of his class, even-keeled.

143
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:54,224
He had a bright future ahead of him.

144
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:54,873
What about at home?

145
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:56,842
He and his wife had a few fights. Like everybody.

146
00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:58,364
But it was mostly smooth sailing.

147
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:00,110
They were even talking about having kids.

148
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:02,854
?All right, so how the kelly had some deep see the crazy way in the bus * ???

149
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,227
- or something else did it to him.
- Right.

150
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:06,070
What did Gunderson tell you about the asylum?

151
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:07,891
A lot.

152
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:35,632
So, apparently,
the cops chased the kids here...

153
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,973
into the south wing.

154
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:42,216
South wing, huh?

155
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,356
Wait a second.

156
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,475
South wing, south wing.

157
00:09:50,493 --> 00:09:52,015
"1972,

158
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:54,076
three kids broke into the south wing.

159
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,673
Only one survived."

160
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:57,167
The way he tells it, one of his friends

161
00:09:57,168 --> 00:09:59,138
went nuts and started lighting up the place.

162
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:01,707
So, whatever's going on,

163
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:03,354
south wing seems like the heart of it.

164
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:04,976
Yeah, but if kids are spelunking the asylum,

165
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:06,793
why aren't there a ton more deaths?

166
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:10,710
It looks like the doors
are usually chained.

167
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:13,430
They could have been
chained up for years.

168
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:15,670
Yeah, to keep people out.

169
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:17,965
Or to keep something in.

170
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:30,664
Let me know if you see
any dead people, Haley Joel.

171
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:31,936
Dude, enough.

172
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,553
I'm serious. You've got to be careful. Right.

173
00:10:34,554 --> 00:10:36,748
Ghosts are attracted
to that E.S.P. Thing you got.

174
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:37,946
I told you, it's not E.S.P.

175
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:40,166
I just have strange vibes, sometimes,

176
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,439
weird dreams.

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,352
Yeah, whatever.
Don't ask, don't tell.

178
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:44,974
Do you get any reading
on that thing or not?

179
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:46,970
No. Of course,
it doesn't mean nobody's home.

180
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:49,290
Spirits can't appear during certain hours of day.

181
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,785
The freaks come out at night.

182
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:51,982
- Ya.
- Hey Sam

183
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:53,554
Who do you think
is a hotter psychic

184
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,675
Patricia Arquette,
Jennifer Love Hewitt or you?

185
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:23,621
Man.

186
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:26,216
Electroshock,

187
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,032
lobotomies. They did
some twisted stuff to these people,

188
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:32,175
kind of like my man Jack
in "cuckoo's nest."

189
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,884
So, what do you think?

190
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,154
Ghosts are possessing people?

191
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:41,676
Maybe.

192
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:45,518
Maybe it's more like Amityville
or the smurl haunting.

193
00:11:45,714 --> 00:11:48,010
Ah, spirits driving them insane,

194
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:50,779
kind of like my man Jack
in "the shining."

195
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:55,491
Dean...

196
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:58,585
When are we going to talk about it?

197
00:11:58,685 --> 00:11:59,333
Talk about what?

198
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:00,955
About the fact that dad's not here.

199
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,076
Oh, uh, let's see, never.

200
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:04,024
I'm being serious, man.

201
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:04,851
So am I, sam.

202
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:07,321
Look. He sent us here.
He obviously wants us here.

203
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,643
We'll just have to
pick up the search later.

204
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,215
It doesn't matter what he wants.

205
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:12,556
See, that attitude right there,

206
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:14,577
that is why I always got the extra cookie.

207
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,799
Dad could be in trouble.

208
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:17,396
We should be looking for him.

209
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:20,240
We deserve some answers, Dean. I mean,
this is our family were talking about..

210
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,659
I understand that, sam,

211
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:22,831
but he's given us an order.

212
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:24,528
So what ? We've got to
always follow dad's orders?

213
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:25,875
Of course we do.

214
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,643
Sanford Ellicott

215
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:40,888
You know what we got to do?

216
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:43,103
We've got to find out
more about the south wing,

217
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,177
see if something happened here.

218
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,778
Sam Winchester?

219
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:04,575
That's me.

220
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:05,647
Come on in.

221
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:14,351
Thanks again for see me last minute.

222
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:30,593
Dr. Ellicott?

223
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:32,611
Ellicott, that name.

224
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:35,929
Wasn't there a dr. Sanford Ellicott?

225
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:38,947
Yeah, he was a chief
psychiatrist somewhere.

226
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:41,989
My father was chief of staff
at the old Roosevelt asylum.

227
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,162
How did you know?

228
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:46,829
Huh, well, I'm sort of
a local-history buff.

229
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:50,768
Hey, wasn't there an incident
or something in the...

230
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:52,864
in the hospital, I guess,
in the south wing, right?

231
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:54,435
We're on your dollar, Sam.

232
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,873
We're here to talk about you.

233
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,867
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, sure.

234
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,733
- So?
- So.

235
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:04,005
How's things?

236
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:06,550
Uh, things are good, doctor.

237
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,448
Good.

238
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:08,895
What you been doing?

239
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:10,863
Uh...

240
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:13,632
same old. I've just been on a...

241
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:15,728
on a road trip with my brother.

242
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:17,025
Was that fun?

243
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:20,116
Loads.

244
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:21,763
Um...

245
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:23,310
You know... We...

246
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:25,954
met a lot of...

247
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:27,825
interesting people.

248
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:28,624
Mm-hmm.

249
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:30,297
Did a lot of, uh...

250
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:32,991
a lot of interesting things.

251
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:34,937
Uh...

252
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,958
You know,

253
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:38,430
what was it...

254
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:40,415
exactly that happened in the south wing?

255
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:41,413
- I forget...
- Look,

256
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:42,960
if you're a local-history buff,

257
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,003
then you know all
about the Roosevelt riot.

258
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:46,101
The riot?

259
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:48,346
- Well, no, I know, I'm just curious --
- Sam.

260
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,517
Let's cut the bull, shall we?

261
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:52,760
You're avoiding the subject.

262
00:14:55,953 --> 00:14:56,852
What subject?

263
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:57,800
You.

264
00:14:58,423 --> 00:15:00,020
Now, I'll make you a deal.

265
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,886
I'll tell you all about the Roosevelt riot

266
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:05,456
if you tell me something honest
about yourself...

267
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:07,152
like, uh...

268
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:09,744
this brother you're road-tripping with.

269
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,715
How do you feel about him?

270
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:23,974
Dude.

271
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:26,219
You were in there forever.
What the hell were you talking about?

272
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:27,764
Just the hospital,
you know.

273
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:28,562
And?

274
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,308
And the south wing,

275
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:31,930
it's where they housed the real hard cases,

276
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,776
psychotics, the criminally insane.

277
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:34,572
Sounds cozy.

278
00:15:34,597 --> 00:15:36,842
Yeah, and one night in '64, they rioted,

279
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,962
attacked the staff,
attacked each other.

280
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:40,609
So, what, the patients took over
the asylum?

281
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:42,278
- Apparently.
- Any deaths?

282
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:44,524
Some patients, some staff.

283
00:15:44,648 --> 00:15:45,796
I guess
it was pretty gory.

284
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:47,542
Some of the bodies
were never even recovered,

285
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,663
including our chief of staff, Ellicott.

286
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:50,935
What do you mean "Never recovered"?

287
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:52,286
Cops scoured every inch of the place,

288
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:54,207
but I guess the patients must have...

289
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,625
stuffed the bodies somewhere hidden.

290
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:59,094
- That's grim.
- Ya.

291
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:01,738
So they transferred
all the surviving patients

292
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:03,285
and shut down the hospital
for good.

293
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:06,275
All right so the * we've got a bunch of violent
deaths and unrecovered bodies.

294
00:16:06,276 --> 00:16:07,821
Which could mean
a bunch of angry spirits.

295
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:10,404
Not good times. Let's check out
the hospital tonight.

296
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:32,574
Check this out.

297
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:34,769
Creepy...

298
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:37,868
yet terrifying.

299
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:41,361
I thought we were going to a movie.

300
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,881
This is better.
It's like we're in a movie.

301
00:16:45,774 --> 00:16:47,545
I can't believe you call this a date.

302
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:51,858
Come on. That'll be fine.

303
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:53,729
That's look around.

304
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:55,500
Come on!

305
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:03,484
- What was that?
- Ugh!

306
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:08,075
Hey, look.

307
00:17:08,297 --> 00:17:09,719
Come on, let's check it out.

308
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:11,540
I don't want to.

309
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:13,037
Let's just go.

310
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:14,359
Come on.

311
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,059
Okay.

312
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:19,656
Okay. You can wait here.

313
00:17:19,756 --> 00:17:21,003
Gavin, no.

314
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:22,325
I'm just gonna be a minute.

315
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:25,693
Nothing's gonna get you, I promise.

316
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:19,469
Damn it.

317
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,761
Hey, sweetie,
couldn't take it, huh?

318
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:30,998
Hey.

319
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:38,033
Gavin, where are you?

320
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,434
Gavin.

321
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:11,641
Getting readings?

322
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,137
No, big-time.

323
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,358
This place is orbing like crazy.

324
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:21,393
There's probably
multiple spirits out and about.

325
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:23,884
And if these unrecovered bodies
are causing the haunting?

326
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:25,205
We got to find them and burn them.

327
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:25,986
Just be careful.

328
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:28,959
The only thing that makes me
more nervous than a pissed-off spirit

329
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:32,217
is a pissed-off spirit of a psycho killer.

330
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:43,901
Dean!

331
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:45,258
Dean!

332
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,870
Shotgun!

333
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,341
Sam, get down!

334
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,415
That was weird.

335
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:00,320
Yeah,

336
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:01,592
you're telling me.

337
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:06,286
No, Dean, I mean, it was weird
that she didn't attack me.

338
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:08,186
It looked pretty aggro from where I was standing.

339
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:09,431
She didn't hurt me.

340
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:10,703
She didn't even try.

341
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,452
So she didn't want to hurt me,
then what did she want?

342
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:43,983
It's all right.We're not going to hurt you.

343
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:46,895
It's okay.

344
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:48,457
What's your name?

345
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:49,277
Katherine.

346
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:51,454
Kat.

347
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:52,359
Okay.

348
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:53,660
I'm dean.This is sam.

349
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:54,904
What are you doing here?

350
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,025
My boyfriend, Gavin...

351
00:21:58,308 --> 00:21:59,354
is he here?

352
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:01,057
Somewhere.

353
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:04,676
He thought it would be fun,
try and see some ghosts.

354
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:07,193
I thought it was all just...

355
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:09,065
you know...

356
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,931
pretend.

357
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,003
I've seen things.

358
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,431
I heard Gavin scream, and...

359
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:20,184
All right, Kat, come on.

360
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:22,446
Sam's gonna get you out of here.
Then we're gonna find your boyfriend.

361
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,076
No, no.

362
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,130
I'm not gonna leave without Gavin.

363
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:28,685
I'm coming with you.

364
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:30,728
It's no a joke around here, okay.
It's dangerous.

365
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:32,509
That's why I've got to find him.

366
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:35,846
All right, I guess we're gonna split up, then.

367
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:37,029
Let's go.

368
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:42,401
Gavin!

369
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,990
Gavin!

370
00:22:50,157 --> 00:22:51,118
Gavin!

371
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,738
Gavin!

372
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:56,497
I've got a question for you.

373
00:22:56,893 --> 00:22:58,816
You've seen a lot of horror movies, yeah?

374
00:22:59,042 --> 00:22:59,834
I guess so.

375
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:01,700
Do me a favor.
Next time you see one,

376
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,916
pay attention.

377
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:04,963
When someone says a place is haunted,

378
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:06,349
don't go in.

379
00:23:21,112 --> 00:23:21,875
Gavin?

380
00:23:22,497 --> 00:23:23,600
Hey, gavin.

381
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:26,626
Hey, it's okay. It's okay. I'm here to help.

382
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,039
Who are you?

383
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,375
My name is Sam.

384
00:23:29,884 --> 00:23:31,213
We found your girlfriend.

385
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:32,571
- Kat?
- Yeah.

386
00:23:32,572 --> 00:23:33,730
Is she all right?

387
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,151
She's worried about you. Are you okay?

388
00:23:37,821 --> 00:23:39,484
I was running. I, uh,

389
00:23:39,614 --> 00:23:40,690
I think I fell.

390
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:42,060
You were running from what?

391
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:45,060
There was...

392
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:48,328
There was this girl. Her-her face...

393
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:51,067
it was all messed up.

394
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:52,110
Okay, listen, listen,

395
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,099
this girl, did she try to hurt you?

396
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,780
What? No, she, uh...

397
00:23:57,595 --> 00:23:58,867
she what?

398
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,215
She kissed me.

399
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,537
Um, but she didn't hurt you physically?

400
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:08,656
Dude, she kissed me.

401
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:10,482
I'm scarred for life.

402
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,358
[ Chuckles ] Trust me, it could have been worse.

403
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,021
And now, do you remember anything else?

404
00:24:15,445 --> 00:24:16,619
She, uh...

405
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,423
Actually, she tried to whisper something in my ear.

406
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:20,930
What?

407
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:23,278
I don't know. I ran like hell.

408
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:39,915
You son of a bitch.

409
00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:42,556
It's all right. I've got a lighter.

410
00:24:45,674 --> 00:24:47,663
Ow. You're hurting my arm.

411
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:49,881
What are you talking about?

412
00:24:58,681 --> 00:25:01,355
Let me out!Please!

413
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,433
Kat, hang on!

414
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:36,985
What's going on?

415
00:25:36,986 --> 00:25:38,142
She's inside with one of them.

416
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:39,382
Help me!

417
00:25:39,447 --> 00:25:40,197
Kat!

418
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:41,469
Get me out of here!

419
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,381
Kat, it's not gonna hurt you.

420
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:46,544
Listen to me. You have to face it.
You have to calm down.

421
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,693
She's got to what?

422
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:48,606
I have to what?

423
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:51,443
These spirits, they don't try to hurt, they're trying to communicate.

424
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:53,041
You've got to listen to. You've got to face it.

425
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:53,986
You face it.

426
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,617
No. It's the only way you're gonna get out of there.

427
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:56,398
No!

428
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:57,572
Look at it.That's all.

429
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:58,974
Come on.You can do it.

430
00:26:20,522 --> 00:26:21,272
Kat?

431
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,794
Now, I hope you're right about this.

432
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:27,998
Yeah, me, too.

433
00:26:37,924 --> 00:26:39,065
Oh, Kat.

434
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:45,659
1, 3, 7.

435
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:47,452
Sorry?

436
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:50,420
It whispered in my ear

437
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:51,952
1, 3, 7.

438
00:26:52,937 --> 00:26:54,404
Room number.

439
00:26:57,698 --> 00:27:00,259
All right. So if these spirits aren't trying to hurt anyone.

440
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,825
then what are they trying to do?

441
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:03,423
Maybe that's what they've been trying to tell us.

442
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:04,564
I guess we'll find out.

443
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,194
All right.

444
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:09,723
So,

445
00:27:09,724 --> 00:27:11,940
now, you guys ready to leave this place?

446
00:27:12,462 --> 00:27:13,669
That's an understatement.

447
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:14,712
Okay.

448
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:16,539
You get them out of here.

449
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,469
I'm gonna gofind room 137.

450
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,307
So, how do you guys know about all this ghost stuff?

451
00:27:31,547 --> 00:27:33,405
It's kind of our job.

452
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:36,412
Why would anyone want a job like that?

453
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,944
I had a crappy guidance counselor.

454
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:45,418
And Dean? He's your boss?

455
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:48,614
No.

456
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,740
All right.

457
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:35,632
I think we have a small problem.

458
00:28:36,217 --> 00:28:37,260
Let's break it down.

459
00:28:37,423 --> 00:28:38,434
I don't think that's gonna work.

460
00:28:38,564 --> 00:28:39,445
Then a window.

461
00:28:39,446 --> 00:28:40,097
They're barred.

462
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:41,793
How are we supposed to get out?

463
00:28:43,782 --> 00:28:45,510
That's the point. We're not.

464
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:47,376
There's something in here.

465
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:48,712
It doesn't want us to leave.

466
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,941
Those patients.

467
00:28:52,006 --> 00:28:52,952
No.

468
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:54,582
Something else.

469
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,851
This is why I get paid the big bucks.

470
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,737
"Patients journal."

471
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:49,542
All work and no play makes Dr. Ellicott,

472
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,669
a very dull boy.

473
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:01,390
Right. I've looked everywhere.

474
00:30:01,672 --> 00:30:02,767
There's no other way out.

475
00:30:03,143 --> 00:30:04,128
So, what the hell are we gonna do?

476
00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:05,745
For starters, we're not gonna panic.

477
00:30:05,885 --> 00:30:06,949
Why the hell not?

478
00:30:09,484 --> 00:30:10,110
Hey.

479
00:30:10,157 --> 00:30:11,189
Sam, it's me.

480
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:13,364
I see it. It's coming at me.

481
00:30:13,682 --> 00:30:14,401
Where are you?

482
00:30:14,402 --> 00:30:15,481
I'm in the basement. Hurry up!

483
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:16,420
I'm on my way.

484
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,751
All right. Can either of you handle a shotgun?

485
00:30:19,158 --> 00:30:20,112
What?! No!

486
00:30:20,566 --> 00:30:21,270
I can.

487
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,763
My dad took me skeet shooting a couple times.

488
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,655
Oh, I heard.

489
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:26,828
It's loaded with rock salt.

490
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:27,845
Now, it might not kill a spirit,

491
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,394
but it will repel it, so if you see something,

492
00:30:29,551 --> 00:30:30,051
shoot.

493
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:30,724
Okay.

494
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:31,569
Okay.

495
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:39,083
Dean!

496
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,515
Dean!

497
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:00,452
Dean?

498
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,296
Don't be afraid.

499
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,142
I'm going to make you all better.

500
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:39,495
Hey, Gavin.

501
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:41,941
Yeah?

502
00:32:43,677 --> 00:32:45,398
If we make it out of here alive,

503
00:32:46,587 --> 00:32:48,105
we are so breaking up.

504
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:52,592
Did you hear that?

505
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:53,828
Something's coming.

506
00:32:57,489 --> 00:32:58,882
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

507
00:32:59,492 --> 00:33:00,822
Don't shoot! It's me!

508
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:02,735
Sorry. Sorry.

509
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,581
Son of a...

510
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:10,167
what are you still doing here?

511
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:11,392
Where's Sam?

512
00:33:11,705 --> 00:33:13,144
He went to the basement. You called him.

513
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:14,787
I didn't call him.

514
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:16,043
His cellphone rang.

515
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,295
He said it was you.

516
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:20,314
Basement, huh?

517
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,474
All right.

518
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:27,571
Watch yourselves.

519
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:30,856
And watch out for me.

520
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,878
Sammy?

521
00:33:39,615 --> 00:33:40,866
Sam, you down here?

522
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:42,572
Sam!

523
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:45,971
Sam!

524
00:33:48,303 --> 00:33:49,038
Man...

525
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,432
Answer me when I'm calling you.

526
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:52,574
You all right?

527
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:53,638
Yeah, I'm fine.

528
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:55,202
You know that wasn't me who called, right?

529
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,286
Yeah, I know. I think something lured me down here.

530
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:58,648
I think I know who

531
00:33:58,867 --> 00:33:59,727
Dr. Ellicott.

532
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:02,375
That's what the spirits have been trying to tell us.
You haven't seen him, have you?

533
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:03,283
No.

534
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:04,425
How do you knowit was him?

535
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:05,770
Because I found his logbook.

536
00:34:05,802 --> 00:34:08,336
Apparently, he was experimenting on his patients.

537
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:09,952
Awful stuff.

538
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:11,658
Makes lobotomies look like a couple of aspirin.

539
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,300
But it was the patients who rioted.

540
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,053
Yeah. They were rioting against Dr. Ellicott.

541
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,782
Dr. Feelgood was working on some
sort of extreme-rage therapy.

542
00:34:19,783 --> 00:34:22,113
He thought if he could get his
patients to vent their anger,

543
00:34:22,223 --> 00:34:23,506
then they'd be cured of it.

544
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:25,196
Instead it only made them worse and worse

545
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,447
and angrier and angrier.

546
00:34:26,651 --> 00:34:28,090
I'm thinking, what if his spirit

547
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:29,529
is doing the same thing?

548
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:30,531
To the cop,

549
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:32,022
the kids in the '70s

550
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:34,697
making them so angry they become homicidal.

551
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:36,449
Come on.

552
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:38,421
We've got to find his bones and torch them.

553
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:39,766
How?

554
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:41,400
The police never found his body.

555
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:44,185
The logbook said he had some
hidden procedure room down here

556
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:46,328
Somewhere where he'd work
on his patients. So,

557
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:48,273
if I was a patient,
I'd drag his ass down here

558
00:34:48,274 --> 00:34:49,634
do a little work on myself.

559
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:51,089
I don't know.It sounds kind of...

560
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:51,871
Of crazy?

561
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:52,387
Yeah.

562
00:34:52,388 --> 00:34:53,858
Yeah, exactly.

563
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,110
I told you I looked everywhere.

564
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:12,815
I didn't find a hidden room.

565
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:14,771
Well, that's why they call it hidden.

566
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:18,765
You hear that?

567
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:21,112
What?

568
00:35:31,978 --> 00:35:33,229
There's a door here.

569
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:37,532
Dean.

570
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:44,518
Step back from the door.

571
00:35:49,472 --> 00:35:50,818
Sam, put the gun down.

572
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:52,351
Is that an order?

573
00:35:54,025 --> 00:35:55,699
That's more of a friendly request.

574
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,999
'Cause I'm getting pretty tired
of taking your orders.

575
00:35:59,631 --> 00:36:00,726
I knew it.

576
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:02,479
Ellicott did something to you, didn't he?

577
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,699
For once in your life,

578
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:05,029
shut your mouth.

579
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,427
What are you gonna do, sam?

580
00:36:06,953 --> 00:36:08,696
The gun's filled with rock salt.

581
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:09,920
It's not gonna kill me.

582
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:13,910
No.

583
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:15,115
But it'll hurt like hell.

584
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:23,906
Sam.

585
00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:26,112
We've got to burn Ellicott's bones,

586
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,520
and all this will be over,

587
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,105
and you'll be back to normal.

588
00:36:29,277 --> 00:36:30,325
I am normal.

589
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:32,969
I'm just telling the truth for the first time.

590
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,191
I mean, why are we even here?

591
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:38,685
'Cause you're following dad's orders
like a good little soldier?

592
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,297
'Cause you always do
what he says without question?

593
00:36:41,595 --> 00:36:43,597
Are you that desperate for his approval?

594
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,240
This isn't you talking, Sam.

595
00:36:45,308 --> 00:36:46,904
That's the difference between you and me.

596
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:49,000
I have a mind of my own.

597
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,018
I'm not pathetic like you.

598
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:53,099
So what are you gonna do? Huh. You gonna kill me?

599
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:56,072
We're no closer to finding dad today

600
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:56,072
You know, I am sick of doing what you tell me to do.

601
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:58,456
We're no closer to finding dad today

602
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:00,395
than we were six months ago.

603
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:03,560
Well, then here.

604
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,641
Let me make it easier for you.

605
00:37:07,831 --> 00:37:08,801
Come on.

606
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:09,943
Take it.

607
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:13,144
Real bullets are gonna work
a hell of a lot better than rock salt.

608
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,100
Take it.

609
00:37:26,981 --> 00:37:28,483
You hate me that much?

610
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,941
You think you can kill your own brother?

611
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,164
Then go ahead.

612
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:38,652
Pull the trigger.

613
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:46,231
Do it!

614
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:06,120
Man, I'm not gonna give you a loaded pistol.

615
00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:14,833
Sorry, Sammy.

616
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:19,739
Oh, that's just gross.

617
00:39:28,804 --> 00:39:29,884
Soak it up.

618
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,170
Don't be afraid.

619
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:46,396
I'm going to help you.

620
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:48,336
I'm going to make you all better.

621
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:41,386
You're not gonna try and kill me, are you?

622
00:40:44,296 --> 00:40:45,125
No.

623
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:46,815
Good.

624
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,152
'Cause that would be awkward.

625
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,492
Thanks, guys.

626
00:40:57,821 --> 00:40:59,010
Yeah, thanks.

627
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,466
No more haunted asylums, okay?

628
00:41:08,894 --> 00:41:09,864
Hey, Dean.

629
00:41:11,256 --> 00:41:12,837
I' sorry, man. I...

630
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:15,950
...said some awful thingsback there.

631
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:17,785
You remember all that?

632
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,037
Yeah.

633
00:41:20,727 --> 00:41:23,605
It's like I couldn't control it, but I didn't mean it

634
00:41:24,012 --> 00:41:24,982
any of it.

635
00:41:25,671 --> 00:41:26,625
You didn't, huh?

636
00:41:27,647 --> 00:41:28,664
No. Of course, not.

637
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:33,112
Do we need to talk about this?

638
00:41:34,129 --> 00:41:35,005
No.

639
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:37,868
I'm not really in the sharing and caring kind of mood.

640
00:41:38,474 --> 00:41:40,023
I just want to get some sleep.

641
00:41:55,337 --> 00:41:56,197
Dean.
