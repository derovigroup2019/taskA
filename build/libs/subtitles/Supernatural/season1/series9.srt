Previously on Supernatural

2
00:00:02,316 --> 00:00:03,885
Let's say good night to your brother.

3
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:05,148
Night, Sam.

4
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:06,652
Hey, Dean.

5
00:00:06,677 --> 00:00:08,206
- Daddy!
- Hey, buddy.

6
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:10,734
Sweet dreams, Sam.

7
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:17,370
Dad's missing.
I need you to help me find him.

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,317
The trail for dad, it's getting colder.

9
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,031
- Every day.
- You don't think I want to find dad as much as you do?

10
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,433
- I know you do.
- Find dad.

11
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,750
Mom's gone. She isn't coming back.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,151
Don't talk about her like that.

13
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,599
Mommy?

14
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,188
Hey, sweetie.

15
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:02,413
- Why aren't you in bed?
- There's something in my closet.

16
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:19,071
See?

17
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:20,385
There's nothing there.

18
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:24,702
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,990
Now, come on.

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,101
Into bed.

21
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:43,167
I don't like this house.

22
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:45,381
You're just not used to it yet.

23
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:52,045
But you and your brother and me,
we are going to be very happy here.

24
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:53,604
I promise.

25
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,864
I love you.

26
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:06,417
The chair.

27
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:08,712
Okay.

28
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:10,329
Right.

29
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:15,258
The chair.

30
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,572
Just to be safe.

31
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:55,348
Please, god, don't let it be rats.

32
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:16,294
Terrific.

33
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:14,578
All right.

34
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:16,400
I've been cruising some websites.

35
00:05:16,505 --> 00:05:18,899
Think I found a few candidates
for our next gig.

36
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:22,963
A fishing trawler found off
the coast of Cali.

37
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,486
Its crew vanished.

38
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:28,200
And we got some cattle
mutilations in west Texas.

39
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:29,299
Hey!

40
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,193
Am I boring you
with this hunting-evil stuff?

41
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,815
No, I'm listening. Keep going.

42
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,596
And here a Sacramento man
shot himself in the head...

43
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,273
three times.

44
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,754
Any of these things
blowing up your skirt, pal?

45
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,817
- Wait, I've seen this.
- Seen what?

46
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:00,791
What are you doing?

47
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:10,872
Dean, I know
where we have to go next.

48
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,584
Where?

49
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:13,151
Back home.

50
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:14,989
Back to Kansas.

51
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:18,258
Okay, random.
Where'd that come from?

52
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,152
All right, um...

53
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,521
this photo was taken in front
of our old house, right?

54
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:23,821
The house where mom died?

55
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:25,922
Yeah.

56
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,161
It didn't burn down right?
I mean not completely, they rebuilt it, right?

57
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:31,590
I guess so, yeah. What the hell
are you talking about?

58
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:33,831
Okay, look,
this is gonna sound crazy,

59
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,944
but the people who live in our old house,

60
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:38,851
I think they might be in danger.

61
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:41,566
- Why would you think that?
- Uh...

62
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:43,646
just, um...
look, just...

63
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,030
You got to trust me on this, okay?

64
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,736
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Trust you?
- Yeah.

65
00:06:49,254 --> 00:06:51,158
You got to give me
a little bit more than that.

66
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,936
I can't really explain,
it is all.

67
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,665
Well, tough. I'm not going
anywhere until you do.

68
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:02,023
I have these nightmares.

69
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:03,728
I've noticed.

70
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,514
And sometimes they come true.

71
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:12,574
Come again?

72
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:14,116
Look, Dean...

73
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,773
I dreamt about Jessica's death

74
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:19,484
for days before it happened.

75
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,827
Sane people have weird dreams, man.
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

76
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:28,510
No, I dreamt about the blood dripping,
her on the ceiling, the fire, everything,

77
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:30,389
and I didn't do anything
'cause I didn't believe it.

78
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:32,067
Now I'm dreaming about that tree,

79
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:35,087
about our house, and some woman inside
screaming for help. I mean,

80
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:37,716
that's where it all started, man.
This has to mean something, right?

81
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:40,824
I don't know.

82
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:44,025
What do you mean you don't know, Dean?
This...

83
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:45,832
This woman might be in danger.

84
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:50,031
- This might be the thing that killed mom and Jessica.
- All right, just slow down,would you?

85
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,670
I mean, first you're telling me
that you've got this Shining...

86
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,756
...and then you tell me
that I've got to go back home,

87
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:01,922
especially when...

88
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:05,009
When what?

89
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:08,714
When I swore to myself
that I would never go back there.

90
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:22,062
Dean, we have to check this out.

91
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,608
Just to make sure.

92
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:33,027
I know we do.

93
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:53,066
You gonna be all right, man?

94
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,793
Let me get back to you on that.

95
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:05,358
Yes?

96
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,988
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,

97
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:09,492
- but we're with the federal...
- I'm Sam Winchester

98
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:11,486
and this is my brother, Dean.

99
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,884
Um...we used to live here.

100
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,169
You know, we were just driving by, and

101
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,603
we were wondering
if we could come see the old place.

102
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:20,825
Winchester...

103
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,817
That is so funny.

104
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:27,333
You know, I,
I think I found some of your photos the other night.

105
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,025
You did?

106
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,441
Okay. Come on in.

107
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:48,446
Juice, juice, juice!

108
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,399
Juice, juice,  juice!

109
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:54,293
That's Richie.
He's kind of a juice junkie.

110
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:57,499
But, hey, at least he won't get scurvy.

111
00:09:58,755 --> 00:09:59,857
Sari,

112
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:02,368
this is Sam and Dean.

113
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,351
- They used to live here.
- Hi.

114
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,817
Hey, Sari.

115
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:08,070
So, you just moved in?

116
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:09,853
Uh, yeah, from Wichita.

117
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:11,375
You got family here?

118
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:14,436
No, I just, uh...

119
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:18,759
um, needed a fresh start.
That's all.

120
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:22,089
So new town,

121
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:23,317
new job

122
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:25,333
I mean, as soon as I find one,

123
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,001
new house.

124
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:30,816
So, how you liking it so far?

125
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,783
Well, uh, all due respect
to your childhood home,

126
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:39,320
I mean, I'm sure you have
lots of happy memories here,

127
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:42,051
but this place has its issues.

128
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:43,536
What do you mean?

129
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:46,706
Well, it's just getting old

130
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:49,235
like, the wiring, you know?
We've got

131
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:51,471
flickering lights almost hourly.

132
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:52,827
Oh, that's too bad.

133
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:54,330
What else?

134
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:58,986
Um...sink's backed up.
There's rats in the basement.

135
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:02,526
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:04,798
- I don't mean to complain.
- No.

137
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,262
Have you seen the rats
or have you just heard scratching?

138
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:12,386
- Just the scratching, actually.
- Mom?

139
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:19,790
Ask them if it was here
when they lived here.

140
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:22,228
What, Sari?

141
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,739
The thing in my closet.

142
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:29,056
Oh, no, baby, there was
nothing in their closets.

143
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:30,011
Right?

144
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:33,083
Right, no.No, of course not.

145
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:36,958
She had a nightmare the other night.

146
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:38,586
I wasn't dreaming.

147
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,186
It came into my bedroom,
and it was on fire.

148
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,114
You heard that ?
A figure on fire.

149
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:48,785
- And that woman Jenny, that was the woman in your dreams?
- Yeah.

150
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:51,607
And you hear what she was talking about ?
scratching, flickering lights ?

151
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:53,907
- Both signs of a malevolent spirit.
- Yeah well.

152
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:56,161
I'm just freaked out your weirdo visions are coming true.

153
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:57,347
Forget about that for a minute.

154
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,213
- The thing in the house, do you think it's the thing that killed mom and Jessica?
- I don't know!

155
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:02,474
Has it come back or has it been
there the whole time?

156
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,824
Maybe it's something else entirely.
Sam, we don't know yet.

157
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,607
Those people are in danger, Dean.

158
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:08,992
- We have to get them out of that house.
- And we will.

159
00:12:09,022 --> 00:12:10,832
- No, I mean now.
- And how you're gonna do that ?

160
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:13,477
- You got a story she's gonna believe?
- Then what are we supposed to do?!

161
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:15,741
We just got to chill out, that's all.

162
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:18,953
If this was any other kind of job,
what would we do?

163
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:25,949
We'd try to figure out
what we were dealing with.

164
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:29,042
- We'd dig into the history of the house.
- Exactly.

165
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:30,601
Except this time we already know what happened.

166
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:34,230
Yeah, but how much do we know?
How much do you actually remember?

167
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,118
- About that night, you mean?
- Yeah.

168
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,032
Not much.

169
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:43,849
I remember the fire...

170
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,742
the heat.

171
00:12:49,662 --> 00:12:51,158
Then I carried you out the front door.

172
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:54,739
You did?

173
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,982
Yeah, well, you never knew that?

174
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:01,150
No.

175
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,088
And, uh...

176
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:06,641
well, you know dad's story as well as I do.
Mom was...

177
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:09,253
was on the ceiling.

178
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,555
Whatever put her there
was long gone by the time dad found her.

179
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,277
And he never had a theory
about what did it?

180
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:18,353
If he did, he kept it to himself.

181
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,538
God knows we asked him enough times.

182
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:25,324
Okay.

183
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:28,744
So, if we're gonna figure out
what's going on now,

184
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,914
we have to figure out
what happened back then,

185
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:34,790
and see if it's the same thing.

186
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:35,421
Yeah.

187
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,904
Talk to dad's friends, neighbors,
people who were there at the time.

188
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:44,125
Does this feel like just another job to you?

189
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:52,599
I'll be right back.
I got to go to the bathroom.

190
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,922
<i>This is John Winchester.</i>

191
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:19,289
<i>If this is an emergency, call my son Dean,
866 907 32 35.</i>

192
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:19,847
Dad...

193
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,515
I know I've left you messages before.

194
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,442
I don't even know if you get 'em.

195
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:31,999
But

196
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:33,584
I'm with Sam

197
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:36,167
and we're in Lawrence,

198
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:39,607
and there's something in our old house.

199
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:43,688
I don't know if it's the thing
that killed mom or not,

200
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:45,576
but...

201
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,982
I don't know what to do.

202
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:52,679
So,

203
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:55,293
whatever you're doing,
if you could get here...

204
00:14:57,257 --> 00:14:58,123
please.

205
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:02,204
I need your help, dad.

206
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,862
No, sir, nothing weird down there.
I promise.

207
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:14,311
- Sink just backed upon its own.
- I'll take a look.

208
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:15,426
Thanks.

209
00:15:16,556 --> 00:15:18,699
Oh, okay, I'll get out of your way.

210
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,743
So you and John Winchester,
you used to own this garage together?

211
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,502
Yeah, we used to. A long time ago.

212
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:08,495
Matter of fact,

213
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:11,665
must be 20 years
since John disappeared.

214
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:13,593
So, why are the cops interested all of a sudden?

215
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:17,660
Oh, we're reopening some of our unsolved cases,
and the Winchester disappearance is one of them.

216
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:20,358
Uh-huh. Well, what do you want
to know about John?

217
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:22,692
Whatever you remember, you know.
Whatever sticks out in your mind.

218
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:28,888
He was a stubborn bastard.
I remember that.

219
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:31,059
And, uh...

220
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:34,015
oh, whatever the game,
he hated to lose, you know?

221
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,786
It was that whole marine thing.

222
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,792
But, uh...

223
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:39,536
well, he sure loved Mary,

224
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:42,034
and he doted on those kids.

225
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:43,993
But that was before the fire.

226
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:45,727
That's right.

227
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:47,427
He ever talk about that night?

228
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:49,606
No,

229
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,025
not at first.

230
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,571
- I think he was in shock.
- Right,

231
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:55,529
but eventually,

232
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:57,977
what did he say about it?

233
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,504
Oh, he wasn't thinking straight.
He said, uh...

234
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:05,613
he said something caused that fire
and killed Mary.

235
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:06,678
He ever say what did it?

236
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:10,136
Nothing did it.
It was an accident.

237
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:14,208
An electrical short in the ceiling
or walls or something.

238
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:19,959
- I begged him to get some help, but...
- But what?

239
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,385
Oh, it just got worse and worse.

240
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:23,135
How?

241
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:27,382
Oh, he started reading these strange old books.

242
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:30,132
He started going to see this palm reader in town.

243
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:32,427
Palm reader?
You have a name?

244
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,479
No.

245
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:42,030
All right, so, there are a few psychics
and palm readers in town.

246
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:44,510
There's someone named El Divino.
There's...

247
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:47,443
There's the mysterious Mr. Fortinsky.

248
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,198
- Uh, Missouri Moseley, some dude --
- Wait, wait...

249
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:51,407
Missouri Moseley?

250
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:52,193
What?

251
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:53,424
That's a psychic?

252
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:56,732
Uh...yeah.Yeah, I guess so.

253
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,263
In dad's journal...

254
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:05,927
Look at this.

255
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:09,957
First page, first sentence.
Read that.

256
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:12,228
"I went to Missouri...

257
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:15,060
and I learned the truth."

258
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,699
I always thought he meant the state.

259
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:24,989
All right, then.

260
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:27,347
Don't you worry about a thing.

261
00:19:28,156 --> 00:19:29,904
Your wife is crazy about you.

262
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:35,959
Whew! Poor bastard.

263
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:38,774
His woman cold-bangin'the gardener.

264
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,809
Why didn't you tell him?

265
00:19:42,203 --> 00:19:44,369
People don't come here for the truth.

266
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:46,232
They come for good news.

267
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:48,537
Well?

268
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:51,960
Sam and Dean, come on already.
I ain't got all day.

269
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,753
Well, let me look at you.

270
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:06,493
Oh, you boys grew up handsome.

271
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,973
And you were one goofy-looking kid, too.

272
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:12,765
Sam.

273
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:17,163
Oh, honey.

274
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,219
I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

275
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:24,465
And your father...

276
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:27,681
...he's missing?

277
00:20:30,614 --> 00:20:32,248
How'd you know all that?

278
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:32,890
Well,

279
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:36,840
you were just thinking it, just now.

280
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,279
Well, where is he?
Is he okay?

281
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,318
I don't know.

282
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:42,992
Don't know?

283
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,775
You're supposed to be a psychic, right?

284
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:50,542
Boy, you see me sawing some bony tramp in half?

285
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:51,974
You think I'm a magician?

286
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:55,325
I may be able to read thoughts and sense energies in a room,

287
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,548
but I can't just pull facts out of thin air.

288
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,021
Sit!

289
00:20:58,274 --> 00:20:58,904
Please.

290
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:12,630
Boy, you put your foot on my coffee table,
I'm gonna whack you with a spoon.

291
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:13,568
I didn't do anything.

292
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:15,146
Well, you were thinking about it.

293
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:23,384
Okay, so...

294
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,140
our dad.

295
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:27,461
When did you first meet him?

296
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,549
He came for a reading

297
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,996
a few days after the fire.

298
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:37,242
I just told him what was really out there in the dark.

299
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:39,108
I guess you could say

300
00:21:40,374 --> 00:21:42,467
I drew back the curtains for him.

301
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:43,573
What about the fire?

302
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:47,633
Do you know about what killed our mom?

303
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,734
A little.

304
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:51,819
Your daddy took me to your house.

305
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:53,771
He was hoping I could

306
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:54,977
sense the

307
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:56,451
echoes,

308
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,507
the fingerprints of this thing.

309
00:21:58,865 --> 00:21:59,812
And could you?

310
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:01,163
I don't...

311
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:03,893
What was it?

312
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:05,555
I don't know.

313
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,251
But it was evil.

314
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:14,858
Look, I feel just awful
about the poor man's hand,

315
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,521
but how can I be held liable?

316
00:22:20,884 --> 00:22:21,467
Yeah, but

317
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:23,730
I can't afford a lawyer.

318
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:28,892
Okay, listen, y-you just got
to let me call you back.

319
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:33,108
Richie, mommy's gonna be right back,

320
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,075
okay?

321
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:35,014
Okay.

322
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,064
Okay.

323
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:41,135
So,

324
00:22:42,683 --> 00:22:45,383
you think something's back in that house?

325
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:47,877
Definitely.

326
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:52,813
I don't understand.

327
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:54,540
What?

328
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:59,011
I haven't been back inside,

329
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:03,443
but I've been keeping an eye on the place,
and it's been quiet.

330
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:05,786
No sudden deaths, no

331
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:07,665
freak accidents.

332
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,288
Why is it acting up now?

333
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:10,633
I don't know.

334
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,726
But dad going missing and Jessica dying
and

335
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:16,677
now this house,

336
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:20,597
all happening at once.
It just feels like something's starting.

337
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,392
That's a comforting thought.

338
00:23:54,438 --> 00:23:55,763
Juicy!

339
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,031
Oh, baby, either we have rats
or mommy is going crazy.

340
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:15,495
Richie?

341
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:19,366
Richie?!

342
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:31,997
Baby, where are you?!

343
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:41,008
Wha...

344
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:51,299
- Mum!
- Oh, my god!

345
00:24:57,488 --> 00:24:58,661
Oh, baby!

346
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:03,461
Sam, Dean,

347
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,009
what are you doing here?

348
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:06,276
Hey, Jenny.

349
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,909
Um, this is our friend Missouri.

350
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:13,068
If it's not too much trouble, we were hoping
to show her the house, you know,

351
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:15,139
for old time's sake.

352
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:17,428
No, you know, this isn't a good time.

353
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:19,424
- I'm kind of busy.
- Listen, Jenny,it's important.

354
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:20,058
Ow!

355
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,738
Give the poor girl a break.
Can't you see she's upset?

356
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,204
Forgive this boy. He means well.

357
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:27,275
He's just not the sharpest tool in the shed.

358
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,691
But hear me out.

359
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,401
About what?

360
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:31,725
About this house.

361
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,902
What are you talking about?

362
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:37,125
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

363
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,091
You think there's something in this house,
something that wants to hurt your family.

364
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:43,580
Am I mistaken?

365
00:25:44,514 --> 00:25:46,251
Who are you?

366
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:49,554
We're people who can help,
who can stop this thing,

367
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,042
but you're gonna have to trust us,
just a little.

368
00:25:54,764 --> 00:25:59,968
If there's a dark energy around here,
this room should be the center of it.

369
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:02,128
Why?

370
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:05,335
This used to be your nursery, Sam.

371
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,646
This is where it all happened.

372
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:24,612
That an emf?

373
00:26:25,006 --> 00:26:25,592
Yeah.

374
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:27,399
Amateur.

375
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:40,602
I don't know if you boys should
be disappointed or relieved,

376
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:42,818
but this ain't the thing
that took your mom.

377
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:45,906
Are you sure?

378
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:48,113
How do you know?

379
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,921
It isn't the same energy
I felt the last time I was here.

380
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:53,368
It's something different.

381
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:55,375
What is it?

382
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:58,495
Not it...

383
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:00,797
them.

384
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,478
There's more than one spirit in this place.

385
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:07,246
What are they doing here?

386
00:27:07,281 --> 00:27:10,140
They're here because of
what happened to your family.

387
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:12,636
You see, all those years ago,

388
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:15,268
real evil came to you.

389
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:21,242
It walked this house.
That kind of evil leaves wounds,

390
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:24,050
and sometimes wounds get infected.

391
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,098
I don't understand.

392
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:29,408
This place is a magnet for paranormal energy.

393
00:27:32,222 --> 00:27:34,632
It's attracted a poltergeist,

394
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,760
a nasty one,

395
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:41,288
and it won't rest until Jenny
and her babies are dead.

396
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:43,552
You said there was more than one spirit.

397
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:45,144
There is.

398
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:51,301
I just can't quite make out the second one.

399
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:57,205
Well, one thing's for damn sure,

400
00:27:57,793 --> 00:27:59,630
nobody's dying in this house,

401
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:00,804
ever again.

402
00:28:01,484 --> 00:28:03,835
So, whatever is here,
how do we stop it?

403
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:09,370
So, what is all this stuff anyway?

404
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:13,250
Angelica root, van van oil, crossroad dirt,

405
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:15,241
a few other odds and ends.

406
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,505
What are we supposed to do with it?

407
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,712
We're gonna put them inside the walls

408
00:28:19,928 --> 00:28:23,160
in the north, south, east, west corners

409
00:28:23,195 --> 00:28:25,127
on each floor of the house.

410
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,270
Punching holes in the drywall.
Jenny's gonna love that.

411
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,647
She'll live.

412
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:33,958
And this will destroy the spirits?

413
00:28:33,993 --> 00:28:35,270
It should.

414
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,461
It should purify the house completely.

415
00:28:39,604 --> 00:28:41,270
We'll each take a floor,

416
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:43,143
but we work fast.

417
00:28:43,178 --> 00:28:46,039
Once the spirits realize what we're up to,

418
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:48,198
things are gonna get bad.

419
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:50,821
Okay.

420
00:28:52,151 --> 00:28:53,534
Careful.

421
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:58,847
Look, I -- you know,
I'm not sure I'm comfortable leaving you guys here alone.

422
00:28:58,882 --> 00:29:01,181
Just take your kids to the movie or something,
and

423
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:03,373
it'll be over by the time you get back.

424
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:04,937
Okay.

425
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:03,372
Aah! Uhh!

426
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,205
Sam!

427
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:45,255
Sam!

428
00:31:08,277 --> 00:31:09,469
Come on.

429
00:31:31,245 --> 00:31:33,130
Are you sure this is over?

430
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:37,609
I'm sure.

431
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:38,646
Why?

432
00:31:39,796 --> 00:31:41,483
Why do you ask?

433
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:43,929
No, never mind.

434
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:47,481
It's nothing, I guess.

435
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:50,840
Hello?

436
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:52,896
We're home.

437
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:57,541
What happened?

438
00:31:57,645 --> 00:32:00,316
Hi. Sorry.
Um, we'll...

439
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,381
we'll pay for all of this.

440
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:04,575
Don't you worry.

441
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,698
Dean's gonna clean up this mess.

442
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:11,707
Well, what are you waiting for, boy?

443
00:32:11,742 --> 00:32:12,510
Get the mop.

444
00:32:13,414 --> 00:32:14,974
And don't cuss at me.

445
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:37,267
Okay.

446
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:33,331
So, tell me again.
What are we still doing here?

447
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:34,827
I don't know, I-I just...

448
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,056
I still have a bad feeling.

449
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:38,651
Why?

450
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:42,812
Missouri did her whole zelda rubenstein thing.
The house should be clean. This should be over.

451
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:45,946
Yeah, probably, but I just want to make sure.
That's all.

452
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:50,466
The problem is I could be sleeping in a bed right now.

453
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:55,775
Dean!

454
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:56,956
Dean!

455
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:00,759
You grab the kids,
I'll get Jenny.

456
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:21,119
- Come on!
- Jenny!

457
00:34:21,157 --> 00:34:23,775
- I can't open the door!
- Stand back!

458
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:28,342
- Come on!
- No, my kids!

459
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:29,469
Sam's got your kids. Come on.

460
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:33,315
Help!

461
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,086
Please!

462
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,813
Come here.

463
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:42,106
Don't look, don't look.

464
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:58,742
Sari, take your brother outside
as fast as you can and don't look back.

465
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:08,617
Are you okay, baby?

466
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,500
- Sari, where's Sam?
- He's inside. Something's got him.

467
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:35,694
Ugh! Aah!

468
00:35:58,741 --> 00:35:59,319
Sam!

469
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:20,881
Sam?!

470
00:36:21,782 --> 00:36:22,307
Sam!

471
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:29,200
- No, don't! Don't!
- What? Why?

472
00:36:30,513 --> 00:36:31,993
Because I know who it is.

473
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:34,487
I can see her now.

474
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:52,949
Mom.

475
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:04,569
Dean.

476
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:21,366
Sam.

477
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:29,501
I'm sorry.

478
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:35,883
F-for what?

479
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,055
You, get out of my house.

480
00:37:51,872 --> 00:37:54,191
And let go of my son.

481
00:38:24,398 --> 00:38:25,970
Now it's over.

482
00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:40,943
Thanks for these.

483
00:38:41,455 --> 00:38:43,558
Don't thank me. They're yours.

484
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:49,143
Well,

485
00:38:49,622 --> 00:38:53,218
there are no spirits in there anymore,
this time for sure.

486
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:56,075
Not even my mom?

487
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,075
No.

488
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:03,921
What happened?

489
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:09,625
Your mom's spirit and the poltergeists' energy,
they canceled each other out.

490
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:13,704
Your mom destroyed herself going after the thing.

491
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:17,222
Why would she do something like that?

492
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,349
Well, to protect her boys, of course.

493
00:39:29,224 --> 00:39:31,220
Sam, I'm sorry.

494
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:34,963
For what?

495
00:39:35,493 --> 00:39:38,355
You sensed it was here,
didn't you?

496
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,115
Even when I couldn't.

497
00:39:45,123 --> 00:39:46,874
What's happening to me?

498
00:39:47,837 --> 00:39:50,839
I know I should have all the answers, but...

499
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,967
I don't know.

500
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:55,984
Sam, you ready ?

501
00:40:01,044 --> 00:40:02,174
Bye.

502
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:06,542
Bye Sam.

503
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:10,213
Ah.

504
00:40:10,894 --> 00:40:13,235
Don't you boys be strangers.

505
00:40:13,658 --> 00:40:14,891
We won't.

506
00:40:16,438 --> 00:40:17,692
See you around.

507
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:50,596
That boy...

508
00:40:52,228 --> 00:40:54,108
he has such

509
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,195
powerful abilities.

510
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,707
Why he couldn't sense his own father,

511
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,537
I have no idea.

512
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:11,426
Mary's spirit...

513
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:15,521
do you really think she saved the boys?

514
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,809
I do.

515
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:33,515
John Winchester, I could just slap you.

516
00:41:33,581 --> 00:41:36,035
Why don't you go talk to your children?

517
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,179
God, I want to.

518
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:43,662
You have no idea how much I want to see them.

519
00:41:46,602 --> 00:41:47,556
But I can't.

520
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:49,923
Not yet.

521
00:41:56,463 --> 00:41:58,238
Not until I know the truth.
