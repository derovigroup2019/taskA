1
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:11,269
Dad's on a hunting trip.

2
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:13,853
And he hasn't been homein a few days.

3
00:00:14,897 --> 00:00:16,557
I sworeI was done hunting.

4
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:17,960
I can't do this alone.

5
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,143
No!

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,500
I think dad wants us to pick upwhere he left off --

7
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:25,545
saving people,hunting things.

8
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:27,507
No, I got to findjessica's killer.

9
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:45,435
okay, what do you think?

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,583
Um...

11
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:49,854
oh, god.Too martha stewart?

12
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:59,023
Here, wear this.

13
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:04,306
Um...I don't knowif this is really me.

14
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:06,525
Lori, there's a hot chickburied somewhere in there.

15
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,804
Okay, okay.

16
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,062
so?

17
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:23,110
Damn, girl!

18
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,337
He's not gonna knowwhat hit him.

19
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:29,846
okay, I thinkhe's probably downstairs.

20
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:31,254
I'll see you later.

21
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,392
Don't do anythingI wouldn't do.

22
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:35,273
There's nothingyou wouldn't do.

23
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:37,965
It's true.

24
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:54,876
Lori: I thought we weregoing to the party.

25
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:57,701
Rich: Well, we can't arriveon time.

26
00:01:58,193 --> 00:01:59,615
You know,if I didn't know any better,

27
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:01,623
I'd think you brought me hereon purpose.

28
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:04,123
What? I'm offended.

29
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:05,714
Yeah, I'm sure.

30
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:19,626
Do you want to get that?

31
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:23,564
Definitely not.

32
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:41,340
No.

33
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:43,129
It's okay.

34
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:02,083
Hey, I mean it.

35
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,283
What was that?

36
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:07,741
I don't know.

37
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:21,413
What is that?

38
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,262
Rich, no!

39
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,341
Just wait here.

40
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:41,135
What the hell?

41
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:42,694
Rich, let's go.

42
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:43,719
Aah!

43
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:45,304
Aah!

44
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:49,352
Rich?

45
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:52,937
Rich?

46
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,910
Rich, Where are you ?

47
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:51,071
Okay.

48
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:53,249
Okay.

49
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:19,832
All right.

50
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:20,736
Thank you for your time.

51
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,713
Your half-caff

52
00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:26,016
double venti vanilla latte

53
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:27,048
is getting cold over here,

54
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:27,721
francis.

55
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:28,675
Byte me.

56
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:30,916
So, anything?

57
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:33,462
I had them check the fbi's

58
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:35,031
missing-persons databank.

59
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:35,914
No "john does"

60
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:37,145
fitting that description.

61
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:38,338
I even ran his plates

62
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,608
for traffic violations.

63
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:40,872
I'm telling you, I don't think

64
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:42,072
dad wants to be found.

65
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:44,648

ankeny, iowa.

00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:49,587
It's about 100 miles

71

83
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:06,965
Could be something

84
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:07,473
interesting.

85
00:06:07,473 --> 00:06:08,344
It could be nothing.

86
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:09,589

90
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,252
But what if it is?

91
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:15,547
Dad would check it out.

92
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:55,690
Why are we here?

93
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,417
Victim lived here.

94
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:00,379
Nice wheels.

We're new in town --transfers.

97
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:10,300
Looking for a place to stay.

98
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:18,030
Who are you?

99
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:19,174
We're your new roommates.

101
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:25,155
Big game today.

102
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:27,642
He's the artist.

103
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:29,491
Things he can dowith a brush...

104
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:35,144
so...

105
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:39,097
murph, is it true?

106
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:40,644
What?

107
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:43,029
We heard one of the guys heregot killed last week.

108
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:45,414
Yeah.

109
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:46,859
What happened?

110
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:49,780
They're saying some psychowith a knife,

111
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,564
maybe a drifterpassing through.

112
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:53,490
Rich was a good guy.

113
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,122
Rich was with somebody?

114
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:59,747
Not just somebody --lori sorenson.

115
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,225
Who's lori sorenson?

116
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:05,571
You missed a spotdown on the back.

117
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,484
Lori's a freshman.She's a local.

118
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:13,367
Super hot.

119
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,976
And get this --she's a reverend's daughter.

120
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:21,633
You wouldn't happen to knowwhich church, would you?

121
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,847
Our hearts go out to the familyof the young man who perished,

122
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,910
and my personal prayersof thanks go out, as well,

123
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:33,005
because I believe he diedtrying to protect my daughter.

124
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:36,607
And now, as time healsall our wounds,

125
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:40,895
we should reflect onwhat this tragedy means to us

126
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,929
as a church.H...

127
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:52,254
.as a community,and as a family.

128
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:57,750
The loss of a young personis particularly tragic.

129
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:02,693
A life unlived is the saddestof passings.

130
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:06,380
So, please,let us pray for peace,

131
00:09:07,578 --> 00:09:08,286
for guidance,

132
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,373
and for the powerto protect our children.

Come on, lori.

138
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:28,368

139
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,905
but you are allowedto have fun.

140
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:31,319
I'll try.

141
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,623
Okay.

142
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:44,704
Are you lori?

143
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:46,220

My name is sam.

145
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:49,064
This is my brother, dean.

146
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:51,914
We just transferred hereto the university.

147
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,569
I saw you inside.

148
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:57,276
We don't want to bother you.We heard about what happened.

149
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:59,430
We wanted to sayhow sorry we were.

150
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:01,108
I kind of knowwhat you're going through.

151
00:10:01,575 --> 00:10:05,571
I -- I saw someoneget hurt once.

152
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:07,805
It's somethingyou don't forget.

153
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:15,529
Dad, this is sam and dean.They're new students.

154
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:17,169
It's a pleasure to meet you,sir.

155
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:19,194
I must say that wasan inspiring sermon.

156
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,419
Thank you very much.

157
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:24,111
It's so niceto find young people

158
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:25,486
who are opento the lord's message.

159
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,665
Listen, we're new in town,actually,

160
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,289
and we're looking for A...

161
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:39,861
tell me, lori,what are the police saying?

162
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:42,557
Well, they don't have a lotto go on.

163
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:45,273
I think they blame mefor that.

164
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,414
What do you mean?

165
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:49,958
My story.

166
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,990
I was so scared,I guess I was seeing things.

167
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:57,487
That doesn't meanit wasn't real.

168
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,614
Dean:So you believe her?

169
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:03,969
I do.

170
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:05,092
I think she's hot, too.

171
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,972
No, man, there's somethingin her eyes.

172
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:08,572
And listen to this.

173
00:11:08,572 --> 00:11:10,148
She heard scratchingon the roof

174
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:11,251
and found the bloody body

175
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:13,801
suspended upside downover the car.

176
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:15,761
Bloody body suspended?That sounds like --

177
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:17,403
the hookman legend.

178
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,485
That's one of the most famousurban legends.

179
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:21,309
You don't think that we'redealing with the hookman.

180
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:22,987
Every urban legendhas a source,

181
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:24,419
a place where it all began.

182
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:27,531
What about the scratchesand the tire punctures

183
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:28,789
and the invisible killer?

184
00:11:28,932 --> 00:11:30,429
Maybe the hookmanisn't a man at all.

185
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:31,773
What if it's some kindof spirit?

186
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:35,821
Here you go.

187
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,980
Arrest recordsgoing back to 1851.

188
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:43,559
[ Coughs ] Thanks.

189
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:44,684
Okay.

190
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:50,651
This is how you spent fourgood years of your life, huh?

191
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,419
Welcome to higher education.

192
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:00,080
Hey, check this out.

193
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:02,269
1862 --

194
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:05,515
a preacher named jacob karnswas arrested for murder.

195
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:08,749
He was so angry overthe red-light district in town

196
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:10,588
that one nighthe killed 13 prostitutes.

197
00:12:12,262 --> 00:12:14,054
"Some of the deceasedwere found in their beds,

198
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:15,093
"sheets soaked with blood,

199
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:17,365
"others suspended upside downfrom the limbs of trees

200
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:19,286
as a warning against sinsof the flesh."

201
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:21,542
Get this --the murder weapon?

202
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:24,214
Looks like the preacherlost his hand in an accident,

203
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,942
had it replacedwith a silver hook.

204
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:29,161
Look whereall this happened.

205
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:31,116
9 mile road.

206
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,835
Same place where the frat boywas killed.

207
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,252
Nice job, dr. Venkman.

208
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:38,503
Let's check it out.

209
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:54,460
I know this is your first timereally living alone

210
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,597
since mom died.

211
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:58,579
That's not it.I worry about you.

212
00:12:59,656 --> 00:13:02,025
There are 22 girls in there.I'm perfectly safe.

213
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,528
That's whatI'm worried about.

214
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:05,025
You don't think I knowwhat goes on in there?

215
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,366
Dad, do we have to havethis argument again?

216
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,667
I'm over 18.I can live my own life.

217
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,163
Which means partyingwith that roommate of yours.

218
00:13:12,163 --> 00:13:14,690
I'm an adult.I can take care of myself.

219
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:15,260
Good night.

220
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,118
Lori.Lori, come --

221
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:19,315
lori.

222
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,333
Taylor, are you awake?

223
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,304
Here you go.

224
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:43,982
If it is a spirit,buckshot won't do much good.

225
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,916
Yeah. Rock salt.

226
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,054
Hmm. Salt beinga spirit deterrent.

227
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,420
Yeah.

228
00:14:54,164 --> 00:14:56,989
It won't kill 'em,but it'll slow 'em down.

229
00:14:58,018 --> 00:15:00,876
That's pretty good.You and dad think of this?

230
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:02,180
I told you,

231
00:15:03,265 --> 00:15:05,338
you don't have to be a collegegraduate to be a genius.

232
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:12,983
Over there, over there.

233
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,275
Put the gun down now!Now!

234
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:29,673
Hands behind your head!

235
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:30,979
Wait, wait, wait!Okay, okay.

236
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,991
Get down on your knees!Come on, do it!

237
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,904
On your knees.

238
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:37,031
Get down on your bellies.Come on, do it.

239
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,615
He had the gun.

240
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:38,987
[ Gasps ]Oh, my god!

241
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:01,953
Saved your ass.

242
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:04,536
Talked the sheriff downto a fine, dude.

243
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:05,894
I'm matlock.But how?

244
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:07,998
Told him you werea dumb-ass pledge

245
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:09,166
and that we were hazing you.

246
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,662
What about the shotgun?

247
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:12,381
I said that you werehunting ghosts

248
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:14,263
and that spiritsare repelled by rock salt.

249
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:16,351
You know,typical hell week prank.

250
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:18,232
And he believed you?

251
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:19,824
Well, you look likea dumb-ass pledge.

252
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,592
I just wantto take her home.

253
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:07,858
I understand, reverend,

254
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,080
but lori's now connectedto two murders

255
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,025
and I can't ignore that.

256
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:12,441
Listen to me.

257
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,755
Arrest her nowor let me take her home.

258
00:18:18,817 --> 00:18:20,532
Make sure she's availablefor questioning.

259
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,810
Thank you.

260
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,202
Why would the hookmanhave come here?

261
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:02,970
This is a long wayfrom 9 mile road.

262
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:04,890
Maybe he's not hauntingthe scene of his crime.

263
00:19:05,114 --> 00:19:06,331
Maybe it's aboutsomething else.

264
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:14,492
Dude, sorority girls.

265
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:17,220
Think we'll seea naked pillow fight?

266
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:51,110
Try and be quiet,will you?

267
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:52,416
Me be quiet?You be quiet.

268
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,442
"Aren't you gladyou didn't turn on the light?"

269
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:24,579
That's right outof the legend.

270
00:20:25,154 --> 00:20:26,532
Yeah, that's classic hookman,all right.

271
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,429
It's definitely a spirit.

272
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:33,050
Yeah. I've never smelled ozonethis strong before.

273
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:37,027
Hey, come here.

274
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,500
Does that look familiarto you?

275
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:49,751
It's the same symbol.

276
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,525
Seems like it is the spiritof jacob karns.

277
00:20:54,771 --> 00:20:55,919
Let's findthe dude's grave,

278
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,829
salt and burn the bones,and put him down.

279
00:20:58,315 --> 00:21:00,626
"After execution,jacob karns was laid to rest

280
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,840
in old north cemeteryin an unmarked grave."

281
00:21:06,757 --> 00:21:07,701
Super.

282
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:11,192
Okay, so,we know it's jacob karns,

283
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:13,991
but we still don't knowwhere he'll manifest next.

284
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:15,571
Or why.

285
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:18,483
I'll take a wild guessabout why.

286
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:20,936
I think your friend lorihas something to do with this.

287
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,179
You've been holding outon me.

288
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:35,924
This college thingis awesome!

289
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:38,352
This wasn't reallymy experience.

290
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,534
Let me guess --

291
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:42,448
library, studying,straight as.

292
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:45,774
What a geek.

293
00:21:46,203 --> 00:21:47,103
Did you do your homework?

294
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:48,620
Yeah, it was bugging me.

295
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:50,164
How is the hookman tiedwith lori?

296
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:52,253
I think I came upwith something.

297
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,887
1932 -- "clergyman arrestedfor murder."

298
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:05,500
1967 -- "seminarian heldin hippie rampage."

299
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,309
There's a pattern here.

300
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:08,277
In both cases, the suspectwas a man of religion

301
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:10,227
who openly preachedagainst immorality

302
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:12,097
and then found himselfwanted for killings

303
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:14,177
he claimed were the workof an invisible force,

304
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:16,174
killings carried out --get this --

305
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,838
with a sharp instrument.

306
00:22:18,027 --> 00:22:19,129
What's the connectionto lori?

307
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,955
A man of religion who openlypreaches against immorality.

308
00:22:24,387 --> 00:22:27,009
Except this time insteadof saving the whole town,

309
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:28,673
he's trying to savehis only daughter.

310
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:29,909
Reverend sorenson.

311
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:31,874
Do you thinkhe's summoning the spirit?

312
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:33,052
Maybe.

313
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,928
Or you knowhow a poltergeist

314
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:38,664
can haunt a person insteadof a place?

315
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,470
The spirit latches onto thereverend's repressed emotions,

316
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,302
feeds off them.

317
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:45,870
Without the reverendever even knowing it.

318
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:50,565
Either way, you should keepan eye on lori tonight.

319
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:52,109
What about you?

320
00:22:58,036 --> 00:22:59,969
I'm gonna go see if I can findthat unmarked grave.

321
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,713
Here we go.

322
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,158
That's it.

323
00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:44,431
Next time, I get to watchthe cute girl's house.

324
00:24:58,578 --> 00:24:59,892
Hello, preacher.

325
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,020
I saw you from upstairs.

326
00:25:21,402 --> 00:25:22,884
What are you doing here?

327
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:26,649
I'm keeping an eyeon the place.

328
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:30,764
I was worried.

329
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:31,974
About me?

330
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:33,839
Yeah, sorry.

331
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,760
No, it's cool.

332
00:25:38,357 --> 00:25:39,562
I already called the cops.

333
00:25:42,244 --> 00:25:44,603
No, seriously,I think you're sweet,

334
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,139
which is probably whyyou should run away from me

335
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:49,402
as fast as you can.

336
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,882
Why would you say that?

337
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:55,699
It's like I'm cursedor something.

338
00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:58,219
People around mekeep dying.

339
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:03,852
I thinkI know how you feel.

340
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:32,323
Goodbye, preacher.

341
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,811
No one willtalk to me anymore...

342
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,812
except you.

343
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,099
The sheriff thinksI'm a suspect.

344
00:26:52,217 --> 00:26:53,581
And you knowwhat my dad will say?

345
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,473
"Pave faith."

346
00:26:55,785 --> 00:26:57,636
What does he knowabout faith?

347
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:02,221
I heard you guysfighting before.

348
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:07,398
He's seeing a woman,a married woman.

349
00:27:07,581 --> 00:27:08,871
I just found out.

350
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:12,354
She comes to our churchwith her husband,

351
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,290
I know her kids,

352
00:27:14,815 --> 00:27:18,263
and he talks to me aboutreligion, about morality?

353
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:21,614
It's like on one hand,you know,

354
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:23,897
just do what you wantand be happy,

355
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:26,878
but he taught me --

356
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:30,076
raised me to believe thatif you do something wrong,

357
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:31,286
you will get punished.

358
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:37,550
I just don't knowwhat to think anymore.

359
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:07,672
Sam?

360
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,924
Lori, I can'T.

361
00:28:11,755 --> 00:28:13,600
That someone you lost?

362
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:19,129
I'm sorry.

363
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,976
Lori.

364
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:24,271
Come inside, please.

365
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:27,047
I'll come inwhen I'm ready.

366
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:31,411
Ack! Aah!

367
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:40,746
No! No!

368
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:57,195
Dad!

369
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:04,948
It's okay.It's all right.

370
00:29:04,948 --> 00:29:06,404
It's okay. It's okay.

371
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:10,937
We were just talking.

372
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,285
Then lori's dad came out,and then he appeared.

373
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:19,227
Man: A big man carryinga weapon, some kind of a hook?

374
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:20,460
Yes, sir.

375
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,374
Ever seen him before?

376
00:29:24,254 --> 00:29:25,095
No, sir.

377
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:29,178
Son, it seems every timeI turn around, I'm seeing you.

378
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:32,786
I suggest you tryto stay out of trouble.

379
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,225
Yes, sir.

380
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,365
It's all right.I'm with him.

381
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:40,030
That's my brother.Hey, brother.

382
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:45,257
Let him through.

383
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:46,748
Thanks.

384
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:50,165
Go ahead.

385
00:29:54,787 --> 00:29:55,264
You okay?

386
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:55,809
Yeah.

387
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,345
What the hell happened?

388
00:29:57,805 --> 00:29:58,606
Hookman.

389
00:29:58,959 --> 00:29:59,729
You saw him?

390
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:00,538
Damn right.

391
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:01,653
Why didn't you torchthe bones?

392
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:05,294
I did. Are you sure it'sthe spirit of jacob karns?

393
00:30:05,294 --> 00:30:07,956
Sure as hell looked like him.And that's not all.

394
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:10,311
I don't think the spiritis latching onto the reverend.

395
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,720
Yeah, the guy wouldn't sendthe hookman after himself.

396
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:17,088
I thinkit's latching onto lori.

397
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:19,337
Last night she found outthat her father

398
00:30:19,337 --> 00:30:21,186
is having an affairwith a married woman.

399
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:22,326
So what?

400
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:23,390
So, she's upset about it.

401
00:30:23,838 --> 00:30:25,655
She's upset aboutthe immorality of it.

402
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:27,428
She was raised to believe

403
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:29,404
that if you do somethingwrong, you get punished.

404
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:31,853
Okay, so shehe's conflicted,

405
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,694
and the spiritof preacher karns

406
00:30:33,694 --> 00:30:35,248
is latching ontoher emotions

407
00:30:35,248 --> 00:30:36,733
and doingthe punishing for her.

408
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:37,772
Right.

409
00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:39,533
Rich comes on too strong.

410
00:30:39,703 --> 00:30:41,552
Taylor tries to make herinto a party girl.

411
00:30:42,122 --> 00:30:43,389
Dad has an affair.

412
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:45,714
Remind me not to pissthis girl off.

413
00:30:47,895 --> 00:30:49,938
But I burned those bones.I buried them in salt.

414
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,323
Why didn't that stop him?

415
00:30:52,637 --> 00:30:54,013
You must've missedsomething.

416
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:57,655
No, I burned everythingin that coffin.

417
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:00,247
Did you get the hook?

418
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:02,897
The hook?

419
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:05,662
It was the murder weapon,

420
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,614
and in a wayit was part of him.

421
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:11,846
So, like the bones,

422
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:13,342
the hook is a sourceof his power.

423
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:15,801
So, if we find the hook...

424
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,694
both:We stop the hookman.

425
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:26,975
Here's something,I think.

426
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,342
Logbook,iowa state penitentiary.

427
00:31:30,342 --> 00:31:31,403
"Karns, jacob --

428
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:33,701
personal affects,disposition thereof."

429
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:34,564
Does it mention the hook?

430
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:38,847
"Upon execution, all earthlyitems shall be remanded

431
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:40,082
"to the prisoner's houseof worship,

432
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:41,504
st. Barnabas church."

433
00:31:42,953 --> 00:31:44,541
Isn't that where lori'sfather preaches?

434
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:45,076
Yeah.

435
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:47,501
Where lori lives?

436
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,944
That's why the hookman'sbeen haunting reverends

437
00:31:49,944 --> 00:31:52,095
and reverends' daughtersfor the past 200 years.

438
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:54,157
But if the hook were atthe church or lori's house,

439
00:31:54,157 --> 00:31:55,453
don't you think someonemight've seen it?

440
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,406
I mean, a blood-stained,silver-handled hook?

441
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:01,581
Check the church records.

442
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,614
"St. Barnabas donations,1862.

443
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:08,285
"Received --silver-handled hook

444
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:09,737
"from state penitentiary.

445
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:11,624
Reforged."

446
00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:16,083
They melted it down,made it into something else.

447
00:32:31,021 --> 00:32:32,417
All right.We can't take any chances.

448
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,856
Anything silvergoes in the fire.

449
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:35,208
I agree.

450
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:37,492
Lori's still atthe hospital.

451
00:32:37,492 --> 00:32:38,508
We'll have to break in.

452
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:39,974
All right,take your pick.

453
00:32:40,694 --> 00:32:41,575
I'll take the house.

454
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:42,624
Okay.

455
00:32:45,316 --> 00:32:46,300
Hey.

456
00:32:47,912 --> 00:32:49,368
Stay out of herunderwear drawer.

457
00:33:07,106 --> 00:33:08,864
I got everythingthat even looks silver.

458
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,903
Better safe than sorry.

459
00:33:24,871 --> 00:33:25,694
Move, move.

460
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:00,643
Lori?

461
00:34:02,436 --> 00:34:03,706
What are you doing here?

462
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:04,547
What is it?

463
00:34:05,763 --> 00:34:09,676
I've been trying to understandwhat's been happening, why.

464
00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:12,835
Now I know, so I'm prayingfor forgiveness.

465
00:34:13,746 --> 00:34:15,310
Forgiveness for what?

466
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:16,983
Don't you see?

467
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:18,768
I'm to blame for all this.

468
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:22,704
I've read in the bibleabout avenging angels.

469
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:23,190
Trust me.

470
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,469
This guy -- he's no angel.

471
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:29,797
I was so angry atmy father.

472
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:32,461
Part of me wanted himpunished,

473
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:35,861
and then he cameand he punished him.

474
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:37,442
It's not your fault.

475
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:39,177
Yes, it is.

476
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,179
I don't know how,but it is.

477
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,582
I killed rich.

478
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:45,936
Taylor, too.

479
00:34:46,337 --> 00:34:47,929
I nearly killed my father.

480
00:34:48,363 --> 00:34:49,035
Lori.

481
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,265
I can see it now.

482
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:55,011
They didn't deserveto be punished.

483
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:56,245
I do.

484
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,871
Come on.We got to go.

485
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:19,872
Go!

486
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:22,234
Come on!

487
00:35:43,397 --> 00:35:44,182
No!

488
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:55,144
Come on, get up.

489
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:10,960
Sam, drop!

490
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:18,620
I thoughtwe got all the silver.

491
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:20,482
Why is he still here?

492
00:36:20,517 --> 00:36:21,868
Maybe we missed something.

493
00:36:24,776 --> 00:36:26,494
Lori, where did you getthat chain?

494
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:28,280
My father gave it to me.

495
00:36:28,408 --> 00:36:29,294
Where'd your dad get it?

496
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:31,183
It was a church heirloom.He gave it to me.

497
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:32,630
Is it silver?

498
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,110
Yes.

499
00:36:50,497 --> 00:36:51,196
Sam.

500
00:38:01,745 --> 00:38:04,380
And you saw him, too,the man with the hook?

501
00:38:04,404 --> 00:38:06,160
Yes, I told you.We all saw him.

502
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,017
We fought him off,and then he ran.

503
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:09,293
And that's all?

504
00:38:10,044 --> 00:38:10,853
Yeah, that's all.

505
00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:16,669
Listen,you and your brother --

506
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,084
oh, don't worry.We're leaving town.

507
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:26,006
You gonna be okay?

508
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,855
Yeah.

509
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:39,368
I still don't knowwhat happened,

510
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:43,399
but I do knowyou saved my life.

511
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:45,275
My father's, too.

512
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:46,581
Thank you.

513
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:13,139
We could stay.
