1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,470
Now, before you leave,

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,800
one of our apple pies,

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,600
on a house.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,540
Oh my God, thank you so much.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,480
Hey, we should get lost more often.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,030
I mean, everyone in this town is so nice.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,380
Yeah, what's the catch?

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,030
You're all set.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,510
Thanks.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,560
That's a cool tattoo.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,440
Thanks.

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,790
So, let's get you back to the interstate.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,040
Yeah, please.

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,600
Take Laski straight out of town.

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,900
And then you're gonna turn right on orchard road.

16
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,350
Okay, thank you.

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,980
What happened?

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,900
I don't know.

19
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,800
- Car just died.
- Ohh.

20
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,940
Cellphone, too.

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,810
How is that possible?

22
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,070
Come on. Looks like a house over there.

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,070
No, I'm not going in there.

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,170
Holly, we need help.
We can't just wait here.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,410
Come on.

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,740
Okay...

27
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,880
Check it out.

28
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,460
"If I only had a brain. "

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,640
We wouldn't be lost.

30
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,740
Thanks.

31
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,930
That has got to be the freakiest damn scarecrow I've ever seen.

32
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,140
It scares me.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,990
Please, let's just hurry, okay?

34
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,150
Did you hear that?

35
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,620
Hello!

36
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,080
Who's there?!

37
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,920
Vince.

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,160
Vince?

39
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,250
Dean.

40
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,210
Hello.

41
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,450
Sam, is that you?

42
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,410
Dad.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,990
Are you hurt?

44
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,660
I'm fine.

45
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,210
We've been looking for you
everywhere.

46
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,470
We didn't know where you were,
if you were okay.

47
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,790
Sammy, I'm all right.

48
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,840
What about you and Dean?

49
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,790
Well, we're fine.

50
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,150
Dad, where are you?

51
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,370
Sorry, kiddo, I can't tell you that.

52
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,740
What?

53
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,600
Why not?

54
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,720
Is that dad?

55
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,770
Look, I know this is hard
for you to understand. Just...

56
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,010
You're gonna have
to trust me on this.

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,350
You're after it, aren't you?

58
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,750
The thing that killed mom.

59
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,390
Yeah.

60
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,190
It's a demon, Sam.

61
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,460
A demon?

62
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,580
You know for sure?

63
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,180
A demon? What's he saying?

64
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,340
I do.

65
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,170
Listen, Sammy, I, uh...

66
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,160
I also know what happened
to your girlfriend.

67
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,830
I'm so sorry.

68
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,570
I would have done anything
to protect you from that.

69
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,390
You know where it is?

70
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,240
Yeah, I think I'm finally
closing in on it.

71
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,300
Let us help.

72
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,330
You can't.

73
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,130
You can't be any part of it.

74
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,200
Why not?

75
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,120
Give me the phone.

76
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,080
Listen, Sammy, that's why I'm calling.

77
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,950
You and your brother, you've got
to stop looking for me.

78
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,330
All right now, I need you
to write down these names.

79
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,410
Names?

80
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,390
What names, dad? Wha...

81
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,030
Talk to me. Tell me what's going on.

82
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,080
Look, we don't have time
for this.

83
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,170
This is bigger than you think.
They're everywhere.

84
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,800
Even us talking right now, it's not safe.

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,650
No.

86
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,840
All right?

87
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,540
No way.

88
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,460
Give me the phone.

89
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,940
I've given you an order.

90
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,420
Now, you stop following me,
and you do your job.

91
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,750
You understand me?

92
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,720
Now take down these names.

93
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,360
Dad,

94
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,040
it's me. Where are you?

95
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,250
Yes, sir.

96
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,300
Uh...

97
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,100
Yeah, I got a pen.

98
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,020
What are the names?

99
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,190
All right, so the names dad
gave us they're all couples?

100
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,350
Three different couples all went missing.

101
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,700
And they're all from different
towns, different states?

102
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,220
You must right. Yeah, Washington, New York, Colorado.

103
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,150
Each couple took a road trip cross-country.

104
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,800
None of them arrived
at their destination.

105
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,250
None of them were ever
heard from again.

106
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,460
Well, it's a big country, Dean.
They could have disappeared anywhere.

107
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,580
Yeah, they could have,

108
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,180
but each one's route took them through the same part of Indiana...

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,640
always on the second week of april,

110
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,680
one year after another after another.

111
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,350
This is the second week of april.

112
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,360
Yep.

113
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,550
So dad is sending us to Indiana

114
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,800
to go hunting for something
before another couple vanishes?

115
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,870
Yahtzee.

116
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,630
Can you imagine putting together a pattern like this?

117
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,730
The different obits dad had to go through,

118
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,980
the man's a master.

119
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,050
What are you doing?

120
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,950
We're not going to Indiana.

121
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,360
- We're not?
- No, we're going to California.

122
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,740
Dad called from a pay phone

123
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,130
Sacramento area code.

124
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,300
Sam.

125
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,820
Dean, if this demon killed mom and Jess and dad's closing in,

126
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,040
we got to be there. We've got to help.

127
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,420
Dad doesn't want our help.

128
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,490
Well, I don't care.

129
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,240
He's given us an order.

130
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,770
I don't care.

131
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,500
We don't always have to do what he says.

132
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:18,230
Sam, dad is asking us to work jobs,

133
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,930
to save lives. It's important.

134
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,250
All right, I understand. Believe me, I understand.

135
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:24,510
But I'm talking one week here,
man, to get answers.

136
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,430
To get revenge.

137
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,970
- All right, look, I know how you feel.
- Do you?

138
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,100
How old were you when mom died,

139
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,110
4?

140
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,060
Jess died six months ago.

141
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,010
How the hell would you know how I feel?

142
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,750
Dad said it wasn't safe

143
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,140
for any of us.

144
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,470
He obviously knows something that we don't.

145
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,500
So if he says to stay away, we stay away.

146
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,490
I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man.

147
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,360
I mean, it's like you don't even question him.

148
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,450
Yeah, it's called being a good son.

149
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,170
You're a selfish bastard. You know that?

150
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,770
You just do whatever you want.

151
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,870
You don't care what anybody thinks.

152
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,240
- That's what you really think?
- Yes, it is.

153
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,050
Well,

154
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,090
this selfish bastard is going to California.

155
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,870
Come on, you're not serious.

156
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,735
I am serious.

157
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,140
It's the middle of the night.

158
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,240
Hey, I'm taking off. I will leave your ass. You hear me!

159
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,770
That's what I want you to do.

160
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,490
Goodbye, Sam.

161
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,430
Let me guess.

162
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,560
Scotty.

163
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,290
Yep.

164
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,880
Hi, my name is John Bonham.

165
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,100
Isn't that the drummer for Led Zeppelin?

166
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,260
Wow.

167
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,440
Good.

168
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,500
Classic-rock fan.

169
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,280
What can I do for you, John?

170
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,810
I was wondering if...

171
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,550
you've seen these people, by chance.

172
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,830
Nope. Who are they?

173
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,930
Friends of mine.

174
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,810
They went missing about a year ago.

175
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,540
They passed through somewhere around here.

176
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,490
I've already asked around Scottsburg and Salem.

177
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,420
Sorry.

178
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,940
We don't get many strangers around here.

179
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,920
Scotty, you got a smile that lights up a room.
Anybody ever tell you that?

180
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,620
Never mind.

181
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,780
See you around.

182
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,190
Hey.

183
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,120
You scared the hell out of me.

184
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm sorry. I just thought you might need some help.

185
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,290
I'm good, thanks.

186
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,420
Uh, so, where are you headed?

187
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,180
No offense, but no way I'm telling you.

188
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,420
Why not?

189
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,690
You could be some kind of freak.

190
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,200
I mean, you are hitchhiking.

191
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,730
Well, so are you.

192
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,460
Need a ride?

193
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,810
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

194
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,190
Just her.

195
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,870
I ain't taking you.

196
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,770
You trust shady van guy and not me?

197
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,520
Definitely.

198
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,280
You sure they didn't stop for gas or something?

199
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,100
Nope, don't remember them.
You say they were friends of yours?

200
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,330
That's right.

201
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,010
Did the guy have a tattoo?

202
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,680
Yes, he did.

203
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,020
You remember?

204
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,620
They were just married.

205
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,870
You're right.

206
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,620
They did stop for gas.
Weren't here more than 10 minutes.

207
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,350
Well, I told them how to get back to the interstate.

208
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,490
They left town.

209
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,070
Could you point mein that same direction?

210
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,010
Sure.

211
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,100
What the hell?

212
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,010
Dude, you're fugly.

213
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,750
Nice tat.

214
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,950
You're back.

215
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,270
Never left.

216
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,070
You still looking for your friends?

217
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,190
You mind filling it up, there, Emily?

218
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,730
So, did you grow up here?

219
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,480
I came here when I was 13.

220
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,020
I lost my parents,

221
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
a car accident.

222
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,910
My aunt and uncle took me in.

223
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,110
They're nice people.

224
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,640
Everybody's nice here.

225
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,500
So, what, it's the perfect little town?

226
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,800
You know, it's the boonies,

227
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,010
but I love it.

228
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,020
I mean, the towns around us,

229
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,570
people are losing their homes, their farms.

230
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,220
But here...

231
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,900
it's almost like we're blessed.

232
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,460
Hey, you been out to the orchard?

233
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,140
Seen that scarecrow?

234
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,640
Yeah, it creeps me out.

235
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,360
Whose is it?

236
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,380
I don't know.

237
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,930
It's just always been there.

238
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,670
That your aunt and uncle's?

239
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,820
Customer.

240
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,160
They had some car troubles.

241
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,700
It's not a couple, is it, a guy and a girl?

242
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,010
Mm-hmm.

243
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,140
Sorry, the Sacramento bus
doesn't run again till tomorrow.

244
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,190
5:05 P.M.

245
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,340
Tomorrow?

246
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,160
There's got to be another way.

247
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,180
Well, there is.

248
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,310
Buy a car.

249
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,260
Hey.

250
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,750
Hey.

251
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,310
You again.

252
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,170
What happened to your ride?

253
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,170
You were right.

254
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,760
That guy was shady.

255
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,320
He was all hands.

256
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,220
I cut him loose.

257
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,660
What's the matter?

258
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,720
Just trying to get to California.

259
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,130
No way.

260
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,060
Yeah.

261
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,810
Me, too.

262
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,900
You know, the next bus isn't until tomorrow.

263
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,400
Yeah.

264
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,930
Yeah, that's the problem.

265
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,820
Why?

266
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,610
What's in Cali that's so important?

267
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,080
Just something I've been looking for

268
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,260
for a long time.

269
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,230
Well,

270
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,650
then I'm sure it can wait one more day, right?

271
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,690
I'm Meg.

272
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,190
Sam.

273
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,090
We're famous for our apples,

274
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,830
so you got to try this pie.

275
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:44,720
Oh, no.

276
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,950
- Please.
- Nope, it's on the house.

277
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,930
Hiya, Scotty.

278
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,030
Can I get a coffee, black?

279
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,940
Mmm.

280
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,530
Oh, and some of that pie, too,while you're at it.

281
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,620
How you doing?

282
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,780
Just passing through?

283
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,760
Road trip.

284
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,720
Mmm.

285
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,960
Yeah, me, too.

286
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,300
I'm sure these people want to eat in peace.

287
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,410
Just a little friendly conversation.

288
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,630
Oh, and that coffee, too.

289
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,540
Thanks.

290
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,160
So, what brings you to town?

291
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,910
We just stopped for gas, and...

292
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,020
the guy at the gas station saved our lives.

293
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,150
Is that righ t?

294
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,120
Yeah, one of our brake lines was leaking.

295
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,440
We had no idea. He's fixing it for us.

296
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,820
Nice people.

297
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,670
Yeah.

298
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,630
So, how long until you're up and running?

299
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,720
Sundown.

300
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,610
Really?

301
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,130
To fix a brake line?

302
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,470
Mm-hmm.

303
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,455
You know, I know a thing or two about cars.

304
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,200
I could probably have you up and running in about an hour

305
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:55,380
and wouldn't charge you anything.

306
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,500
You know, thanks a lot,

307
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,760
but I think we'd rather have a mechanic do it.

308
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,760
Sure. You know,

309
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,870
You know, it's just that these roads, huh..

310
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,180
they're not real safe at night.

311
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,980
I'm sorry?

312
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,220
I know it sounds strange.

313
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,430
But, uh,

314
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,660
you might be in danger.

315
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,300
We're trying to eat. Okay?

316
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,660
Yeah.

317
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,250
You know, my brother could give you

318
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,780
his puppy-dog look,

319
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,630
and you'd just buy right into it.

320
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,890
Thanks for coming, sheriff.

321
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,750
I'd like a word, please.

322
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,900
Come on. I'm having a bad day already.

323
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,370
You don't want to make it worse.

324
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,640
So, what, are you on some kind of vacation or something?

325
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,050
Yeah, right.

326
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,950
It's all sipping cristal poolside for me.

327
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,100
No.

328
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,720
I had to...

329
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,310
get away from my family.

330
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,990
Why?

331
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,530
I love my parents.

332
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,270
And they wanted what's best for me.

333
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,820
They just didn't care if I wanted it.

334
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,230
I was supposed to be smart,

335
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,870
but not smart enough to scare away a husband.

336
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,810
Well, it's just...

337
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,350
because my family said so,

338
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,430
I'm supposed to sit there and do what I was told.

339
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,480
So I just went on my own way instead.

340
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,480
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,690
The things you say to people you hardly know.

342
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,380
No. No, it's okay.

343
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,890
I know how you feel.

344
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,910
Remember that brother I mentioned before
that I was road-tripping with?

345
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,450
It's kind of the same deal.

346
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,540
And that's why you're not riding with him anymore?

347
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,170
Here's to us.

348
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,530
The food might be bad

349
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,350
and the beds might be hard,

350
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,520
but at least we're living our own lives...

351
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,740
and nobody else's.

352
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,540
I can't believe it. We just got the car fixed.

353
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,420
This way.

354
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,110
Steve.

355
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,550
Who's there?!

356
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,940
Get back to your car.

357
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,300
Go, go!

358
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,830
Go, go!

359
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,140
What-what the hell was that?

360
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:55,770
Don't ask.

361
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,550
The scarecrow climbed off its cross?

362
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,570
Hey, I'm telling you,
Burkitsville, Indiana, fun town.

363
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,120
It didn't kill the couple, did it?

364
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,040
No.

365
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,130
I can cope without you, you know.

366
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,510
So something must be animating it, a spirit.

367
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,800
No, it's more than a spirit.

368
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,920
It's a god, a pagan god, anyway.

369
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,560
What makes you say that?

370
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,650
The annual cycle of its killings,

371
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,560
and the fact that the victims are always a man and a woman,

372
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,330
like some kind of fertility rite.

373
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,090
And you should see the locals.

374
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,640
The way they treated this couple

375
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,660
fattening them up like a christmas turkey.

376
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,070
The last meal...

377
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,170
given to sacrificial victims.

378
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,450
Yeah, I'm thinking a ritual sacrifice
to appease some pagan god.

379
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,860
So a god possesses the scarecrow...

380
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,470
the scarecrow takes its sacrifice.

381
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,680
And for another year,

382
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,290
the crops won't wilt and disease won't spread.

383
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,850
You know which god you're dealing with?

384
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,110
Nope, not yet.

385
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,590
You figure out what it is,
you can figure out a way to kill it.

386
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,640
I know. I'm actually on my way to a local community college.

387
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,270
I got an appointment with a professor.

388
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,010
You know, since I don't have my

389
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,940
trusty sidekick geek boy
to do all the research.

390
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,980
You know,

391
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,720
if you're hinting you need my help,

392
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,150
just ask.

393
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,320
I'm not hinting anything.

394
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,760
Actually...

395
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,270
I want you to know...

396
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,060
I mean, don't think...

397
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,790
Yeah,

398
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,150
I'm sorry, too.

399
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,270
Sam...

400
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,600
you were right.

401
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,610
You got to do your own thing.

402
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,100
You got to live your own life.

403
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,950
You're serious?

404
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,210
You've always known what you want,

405
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,570
and you go after it.

406
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,570
You stand up to dad.

407
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,630
and you always have.

408
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,700
Hell, I wish I...

409
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,750
anyway...

410
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,860
I admire that about you.

411
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,510
I'm proud of you, Sammy.

412
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,760
I don't even know what to say.

413
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,380
Say you'll take care of yourself.

414
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,550
I will.

415
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,380
Call me when you find dad.

416
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,490
Okay. Bye, Dean.

417
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,010
Who was that?

418
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,060
My brother.

419
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,220
What did he say?

420
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,950
"Goodbye. "

421
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,050
It's not every day I get a research question on pagan idolatry.

422
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,190
Yeah, well, call it a hobby.

423
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,310
But you said you were interested in local lore?

424
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,900
I'm afraid Indiana isn't really known for its pagan worship.

425
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,540
What if it was imported?

426
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,690
You know, like the pilgrims brought their religion over.

427
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,400
Wasn't a lot of this area settled by immigrants?

428
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,080
Yeah. Mmm..

429
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,350
Like that town near here, Burkitsville,

430
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,710
where are their ancestors from?

431
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,930
Northern Europe, I believe. Scandinavia.

432
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,720
What could you tell me about those pagan gods?

433
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,220
Well, there are hundreds of norse gods and goddesses.

434
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,840
I'm actually looking for one,

435
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,200
might live in an orchard.

436
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,520
A woods god.

437
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,170
Well, let's see.

438
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,050
Wait, wait, wait. What's that one?

439
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,650
That's not a woods god, per se.

440
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,900
The Vanir?

441
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,460
"Vanir were norse gods of protection and prosperity,"

442
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:49,550
"keeping the local settlements safe from harm. "

443
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,190
"Villages built effigies of the Vanir in their fields. "

444
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,650
"Other villages practiced human sacrifice,"

445
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,850
"one male and one female. "

446
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,970
It kind of looks like a scarecrow, huh?

447
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,080
Well, I suppose.

448
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,220
"This particular vanir, its energy sprung from a sacred tree"?

449
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,110
Well, pagans believed all sorts of things
were infused with magic.

450
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,740
So, what would happen if the sacred tree was torched?

451
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,820
Do you think it would kill the god?

452
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,390
Son,

453
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,660
these are just legends we're discussing here.

454
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,570
Oh, of course.

455
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,440
Yeah, you're right.

456
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,080
Listen, thank you very much.

457
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,620
- Glad I could help.
- All right.

458
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,260
You do understand, Harley?

459
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,060
All of us here,

460
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,780
it's our responsibility to protect the town.

461
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,840
I understand...

462
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,720
better than all of you.

463
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,940
I'm the one that gives them directions.

464
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm the one that sends them down to the orchard.

465
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,690
Harley, please.

466
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,190
We all close our doors,

467
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,280
look the other way,

468
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,390
pretend we can't hear the screams.

469
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,290
But this is different.

470
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,830
This is murder.

471
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,380
It's angry with us.

472
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,470
Already the trees are beginning to die.

473
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,950
Tonight's the seventh night of the cycle,

474
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,280
our last chance.

475
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,260
If the boy has to die,

476
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,030
the boy has to die.

477
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,930
But why does it have to be her?

478
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,720
Aunt Stacy...

479
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,520
uncle Harley, please.

480
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,750
Why are you doing this?

481
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,550
For the common good.

482
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,740
Hey.

483
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,250
Our bus came in.

484
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,530
You better catch it.

485
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,950
I got to go.

486
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,380
Go where?

487
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,460
Burkitsville.

488
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,900
Sam...

489
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,710
wait.

490
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,630
I've been trying to call my brother
for the last three hours.

491
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,370
I'm just getting his voice mail.

492
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,900
Maybe his phone is turned off.

493
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,310
No, that's not like him.

494
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,580
Meg, I think he might be in trouble.

495
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,030
What kind of trouble?

496
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,660
I can't really explain right now.

497
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,780
I'm sorry.
Look, I don't want youto miss your bus.

498
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,630
But I don't understand.

499
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,020
You're running back to your brother?

500
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,620
The guy you ran away from?

501
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,910
Why, because he won't pick up his phone?

502
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,860
Sam...

503
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,120
come...

504
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,280
with me to California.

505
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,490
I can't.

506
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,320
I'm sorry.

507
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,610
Why not?

508
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,870
He's my family.

509
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,920
I don't understand.

510
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,260
They're gonna kill us?

511
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,830
Sacrifice us...

512
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,540
which is,

513
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,330
I don't know, classier, I guess.

514
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,820
You really didn't know anything about this...

515
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,530
did you?

516
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,350
About what?

517
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,180
The scarecrow god?

518
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,210
I can't believe this.

519
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,860
Well, you better start believing,

520
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,420
because I'm gonna need your help.

521
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,880
Okay.

522
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,810
Now,

523
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,730
we can destroy the scarecrow,
but we got to find the tree.

524
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,910
What tree?

525
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,580
Maybe you can help me with that.

526
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,390
It would be really old.

527
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,100
The locals would treat it with a lot of respect,

528
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,480
like it was sacred.

529
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,240
There was this one apple tree.

530
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,350
The immigrants brought it over with them.

531
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,180
They call it"the first tree. "

532
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,500
Is it in the orchard?

533
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,480
Yeah,

534
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,930
but I don't know where.

535
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,770
It's time.

536
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,450
How many people have you killed, sheriff?

537
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,460
How much blood is on your hands?

538
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,860
We don't kill them.

539
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,590
No, but you sure cover up after.

540
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,780
I mean, how many cars have you hidden
or clothes have you buried?

541
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,860
Uncle Harley,

542
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,510
please.

543
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,410
I am so sorry, Em.

544
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,520
I wish it wasn't you.

545
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,600
Try to understand.

546
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,500
It's our responsibility.

547
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,770
And there's just no other choice.

548
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,450
There's nobody else but you.

549
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,120
I'm your family.

550
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,650
Sweetheart...

551
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,600
...that's what sacrifice means,

552
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,140
giving up something you love

553
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,630
for the greater good.

554
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,530
The town needs to be saved.

555
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,790
The good of the many

556
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,640
outweighs the good of the one.

557
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,500
I hope your apple pie is freakin' worth it!

558
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,960
So, what's the plan?

559
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,720
I'm working on it.

560
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,660
You don't have a plan, do you?

561
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,210
I'm working on it.

562
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,220
Can you see?

563
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:27,765
What?

564
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,780
Is he moving yet?

565
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,640
I can't see.

566
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,090
Oh, my god.

567
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,280
Oh, my god!

568
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,380
Dean?

569
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,520
Oh, I take everything back I said.

570
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,090
I'm so happy to see you.

571
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,250
Come on.

572
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,330
How did you get here?

573
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,630
I, uh...

574
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,380
stole a car.

575
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,140
That's my boy.

576
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,480
Keep an eye on that scarecrow.

577
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,440
It could come alive any minute.

578
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,930
What scarecrow?

579
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,720
All right, now, this sacred tree you're talking about.

580
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,860
It's the source of its power.

581
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,060
So let's find it and burn it.

582
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,890
In the morning. Let's just shag ass before leatherface catches up.

583
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,220
This way.

584
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,590
Please, let us go.

585
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,970
It will be over quickly. I promise.

586
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,000
Please.

587
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,930
Emily, you have to let him take you.

588
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,020
you have to-huh!

589
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,930
Let's go.

590
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,240
Let me.

591
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,120
The whole town is gonna die.

592
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,490
Good.

593
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,610
You think she's gonna beall right?

594
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,770
I hope so.

595
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,540
And the rest of the towns people,
they'll just get away with it?

596
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,960
What will happen to the town

597
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,430
will have to be punishment enough.

598
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,550
So...

599
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,320
can I drop you off somewhere?

600
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,870
No, I think you're stuck with me.

601
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,730
What made you change your mind?

602
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,740
I didn't.

603
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,660
I still want to find dad.

604
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,980
And you're still a pain in the ass.

605
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,520
But Jess and mom...

606
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,550
they're both gone.

607
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,760
Dad is god knows where.

608
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,800
You and me,

609
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,380
we're all that's left.

610
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,930
So, uh,

611
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,580
if we're gonna see this through...

612
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,780
we're gonna do it together.

613
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,980
Hold me, Sam.

614
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,420
That was beautiful.

615
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,550
Come on.

616
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,320
You should be kissing my ass.

617
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,480
You were dead meat, dude.

618
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,760
Yeah, right. I had a plan. I'd have gotten out.

619
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,140
Right.

620
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,400
So, where to, pretty lady?

621
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,430
How about you pull over?

622
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,600
Okay.

623
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,960
that works.

624
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,910
What's that?

625
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,470
I've got to make a call.

626
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,990
I got a cell you can use.

627
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,820
It's not that kind of call.

628
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,360
Thanks for the ride.

629
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,530
It makes no sense.

630
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,520
I could have stopped sam.

631
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,630
Hell, I could have taken them both.

632
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,350
Why let them go?

633
00:39:59,300 --> 00:39:59,950
Yes.

634
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,690
Yes.

635
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:10,650
Yes, father.
