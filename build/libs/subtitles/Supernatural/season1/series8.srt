00:00:00,452 --> 00:00:02,484
Previously on Supernatural

2
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:03,378
Sammy!

3
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:06,088
Take your brother outside as fast as you can!

4
00:00:06,111 --> 00:00:06,674
Go!

5
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:11,601
Dad's on a hunting trip.

6
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,686
And he hasn't been home in a few days.

7
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:20,923
This is dad's book. I think dad wants us
to pick up where he left off.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,876
Saving people, hunting things.

9
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,519
- Family business.
- Do you think Mom wanted all this for us?

10
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:26,645
I can't do this alone.

11
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:28,163
I'm driving.

12
00:01:00,547 --> 00:01:02,416
Man, these are some phat houses, huh?

13
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:03,923
I'd like to live here.

14
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:04,599
Yeah.

15
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:06,708
Too bad you can't afford it.

16
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:08,837
Yeah, you're right.

17
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:11,850
This neighborhood will be damn expensive when it's done.

18
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:37,899
This place is perfect...

19
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:38,903
ow!

20
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:41,283
...Except for the mosquitoes.

21
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:46,100
Aah!

22
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,744
Dustin?

23
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:50,183
Help me, I'm trapped!

24
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:52,416
I broke my ankle.

25
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:54,991
I'll get a rope!

26
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,537
Oh, damn.

27
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:16,664
Oh god!

28
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,749
Travis, help!

29
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:29,710
Hang on!

30
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,513
Travis, help!

31
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:43,775
Aah! Aaah!

32
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,525
It's okay, Dustin. It's okay.

33
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:49,517
Dustin?

34
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,907
Dustin, I'm here.

35
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:54,945
Oh, god.

36
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:04,603
<i>I got something to say.</i>

37
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:21,936
<i>ow!</i>

38
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:25,648
<i>Yeah, you're doing all right.</i>

39
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,282
<i>gonna start a fire</i>

40
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:32,478
You know, we could get day jobs once in a while.

41
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:34,468
Hunting's our day job,

42
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:36,110
and the pay is crap.

43
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,518
Yeah, but hustling pool,

44
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:39,158
credit-card scams?

45
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:41,513
It's not the most honest thing in the world, Dean.

46
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:42,804
Well, let's see... Honest...

47
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:44,506
fun and easy...

48
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:46,879
It's no contest.

49
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:47,484
Besides,

50
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:49,404
we're good at it.
It's what we were raised to do.

51
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:52,284
- How we were raised was jacked.
- Yeah, says you.

52
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:54,328
- We got a new gig or what?
- Maybe.

53
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,203
Oasis Plains, Oklahoma.
Not far from here.

54
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:58,856
Gas-company employee.

55
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:01,362
Dustin Burwash,

56
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,907
supposedly died from creutzfeldt-jakob.

57
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:04,584
Huh?

58
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:07,399
- Human mad cow disease.
- Mad cow?

59
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:09,856
Wasn't that on "Oprah"?

60
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:11,428
You watch "Oprah"?

61
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,531
So this guy eats a bad burger.
Why is it our kind of thing?

62
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:21,528
Mad cow disease causes massive brain degeneration.

63
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:23,998
It takes months, even years
for the damage to appear,

64
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:25,188
but this guy, Dustin,

65
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:27,994
sounds like his brain disintegrated
in about an hour,

66
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,258
maybe less.

67
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,748
- Okay, that's weird.
- Yeah.

68
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,523
Now, it could be a disease,

69
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:34,710
or it could be something much nastier.

70
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,301
All right, Oklahoma.

71
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:39,429
Man, work, work, work.

72
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:41,733
No time to spend my money.

73
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:46,770
<i>We got the power, we got the glory</i>

74
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,020
<i>Just say you need it...</i>

75
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:57,802
Travis Weaver?

76
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:00,358
Yeah, that's right.

77
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:03,756
Are you the Travis who worked with uncle Dusty?

78
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:06,489
Dustin never mentioned nephews.

79
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:07,650
Really?

80
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,316
Well, he sure mentioned you.

81
00:05:09,363 --> 00:05:10,829
He said you were the greatest.

82
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:12,037
Oh, he did?

83
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:13,182
Huh.

84
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:15,681
So, we wanted to ask you...

85
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,417
what exactly happened out there?

86
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:19,693
I'm not sure.

87
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:22,866
He fell in the sinkhole.
I went to the truck to get some rope, and

88
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:24,696
by the time I got back...

89
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:26,620
What'd you see?

90
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:28,591
Nothing.

91
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:30,052
Just Dustin.

92
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:31,870
No wounds or anything?

93
00:05:32,316 --> 00:05:33,231
Well, he was bleeding

94
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,846
from his eyes and his ears, his nose,

95
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,242
that's it.

96
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:39,670
So do you think it could be this whole mad cow thing?

97
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,035
I don't know.

98
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:43,853
That's what the doctors are saying.

99
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:44,827
But if it was,

100
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:49,824
he would have acted strange beforehand,
like dementia, loss of motor control.

101
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,821
- You ever notice anything like that?
- No.

102
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:52,752
No way.

103
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:56,316
Yeah, but if it wasn't some disease,
what the hell was it?

104
00:05:57,517 --> 00:05:58,395
That's a good question.

105
00:05:58,599 --> 00:05:58,972
Yep.

106
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:00,595
Can you tell us where this happened?

107
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:01,751
Yeah.

108
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:26,024
Huh.

109
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:28,296
What do you think?

110
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,002
I don't know,

111
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:32,607
but if that guy Travis was right,
it happened pretty damn fast.

112
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:34,200
So what?

113
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:36,175
Some sort of creature chewed on his brain?

114
00:06:36,198 --> 00:06:37,625
No, there'd be an entry wound.

115
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:39,744
Sounds like this thing worked from the inside.

116
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:44,105
Huh.

117
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:47,088
It looks like there's only room for one.

118
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:48,966
You want to flip a coin?

119
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,240
Dean, we have no idea what's down there.

120
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:55,268
All right, I'll go if you're scared.

121
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,551
Scared?

122
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:58,068
Flip the damn coin.

123
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:02,563
Call it in the air...

124
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:03,405
chicken.

125
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,034
I'm going.

126
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:07,011
I said I'd go.

127
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:08,333
I'm going.

128
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:09,600
All right.

129
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:12,858
Don't drop me.

130
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,107
So, you found some beetles

131
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:20,550
in a hole in the ground.

132
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:22,860
That's shocking, Sam.

133
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:25,429
There were no tunnels, no tracks,

134
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:28,385
no evidence of any other kind of creature down there.

135
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:30,386
You know, some beetles do eat meat.

136
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:33,192
Now, it's usually dead meat, but...
- How many did you find down there?

137
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:33,924
10.

138
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:37,730
It would take a whole lot more than that
to eat out somebody's brain.

139
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:39,063
Well, maybe there were more.

140
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,502
I don't know. It sounds like a stretch to me.

141
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:44,362
We need more information on the area, the neighborhood,

142
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:47,025
whether something like this has ever happened before.

143
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:49,524
What?

144
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,588
I know a good place to start.

145
00:07:53,154 --> 00:07:55,429
I'm kind of hungry for a little barbecue,
how about you?

146
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,652
What, we can't talk to the locals?

147
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,874
- And the free food's got nothing to do with it?
- Of course not. I'm a professional.

148
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:03,953
Right.

149
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:26,491
Growing up in a place like this would freak me out.

150
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:27,795
Why?

151
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,362
The manicured lawns, the"how was your day, honey?"...

152
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:33,940
I'd blow my brains out.

153
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:37,213
There's nothing wrong with normal.

154
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:40,380
I'd take our family over normal any day.

155
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:46,440
- Welcome.
- Is this the barbecue?

156
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:48,774
Yeah, not the best weather, but...

157
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,704
- I'm Larry Pike, the developer here, and you are?
- Dean. This is Sam.

158
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:54,563
Sam, Dean, good to meet you.

159
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:57,578
- So, you two are interested in Oasis Plains?
- Yes, sir.

160
00:08:58,106 --> 00:08:58,962
Let me just say

161
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:02,552
that we accept homeowners
of any race,religion, color, or...

162
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:04,448
sexual orientation.

163
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,099
We're brothers.

164
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,729
Our father is getting on in years,
and we're just looking for a place for him.

165
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:12,409
Great,

166
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:14,720
great. Well, seniors are welcome, too.
Come on in.

167
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,889
You said you were the developer?

168
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:23,975
18 months ago, I was walking this valley with my survey team.

169
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,098
There was nothing here but scrub brush and squirrels,

170
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:29,914
and you know what?
We built such a nice place to live

171
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,607
that I actually bought into it myself.
This is our house.

172
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:37,012
We're the first family in Oasis Plains.
This is my wife, Joanie.

173
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:37,951
- Hi, there.
- Hi,

174
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:39,556
- nice to meet you.
- Sam and Dean.

175
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:41,031
- Sam.
- Joannie.

176
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:42,814
Tell them how much you love the place, honey.

177
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:46,141
And lie if you have to because I need to sell some houses.

178
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:48,694
Boys, if you'll excuse me.

179
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:53,104
Don't let his salesman routine scare you.
This really is a great place to live.

180
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:55,132
Hi, I'm Linda Bloom, head of sales.

181
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:56,868
And Linda was second to move in.

182
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,764
She's a very noisy neighbor, though.

183
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,835
She's kidding, of course.

184
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,716
I take it you two are interested in becoming homeowners.

185
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:06,650
- Well...
- Y-yeah.

186
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:11,859
Well, let me just say that we accept homeowners
of any race, religion, color,or...

187
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,252
sexual orientation.

188
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,108
Hmm.

189
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:15,976
Right.

190
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,463
Uh, I'm gonna go talk to Larry.

191
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,659
Okay, honey?

192
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:26,877
You have three choices...

193
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:29,047
carpet, hardwood, and tile.

194
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:29,845
Whoa,

195
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:31,886
someone likes bugs.

196
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:35,523
My son. He's into insects.

197
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,758
He's very inquisitive.

198
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:39,130
Hmm.

199
00:10:39,283 --> 00:10:42,509
Who can say no to a steam shower?
I use mine every day.

200
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,940
Sounds great.

201
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:47,336
You also have three different whirlpool tubs
to choose from.

202
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:49,522
The hardware for the tubs include nickel, brass,

203
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:52,557
- and when you see the kitchens, you can choose from...
- Excuse me.

204
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:54,021
Um, okay.

205
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,371
Is this yours?

206
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:09,351
- You gonna tell my dad?
- I don't know.

207
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,483
Who's your dad?

208
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:11,873
Yeah.

209
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,610
Larry usually skips me in the family introductions.

210
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:18,281
Ouch. First-name basis with the old man...
sounds pretty grim.

211
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,252
Well, I'm not exactly brochure material.

212
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:22,924
Well, hang in there. It gets better.
Alright? I promise.

213
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,068
When?

214
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:24,713
Matthew!

215
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:36,215
I am so sorry about my son and his...

216
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:37,834
- pet.
- It's no bother.

217
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:39,394
Excuse us.

218
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:47,785
Remind you of somebody?

219
00:11:52,536 --> 00:11:53,169
Dad?

220
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:55,980
Dad never treated us like that.

221
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,854
Well, dad never treated you like that.
You were perfect.

222
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:00,343
He was all over my case.

223
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,283
You don't remember?

224
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:06,555
Maybe he had to raise his voice,
but sometimes you were out of line.

225
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:07,294
Right.

226
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,177
Right, like when I said I'd rather play soccer
than learn bow hunting.

227
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:12,920
Bow hunting's an important skill.

228
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:14,796
Whatever.

229
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,917
How was your tour?

230
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,110
It was excellent.I'm ready to buy.

231
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:22,112
So you might be onto something.

232
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:25,443
Looks like Dustin Burwash
wasn't the first strange death around here.

233
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:26,205
What happened?

234
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:28,212
About a year ago, before they broke ground,

235
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:30,511
one of Larry's surveyors dropped dead while on the job.

236
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:33,436
Get this... severe allergic reaction to bee stings.

237
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:34,984
- More bugs.
- More bugs.

238
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,912
I've heard of killer bees, but killer beetles?

239
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,996
What is it that could make different bugs attack?

240
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:46,683
Well, hauntings sometimes include bug manifestations.

241
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:49,199
Yeah, but I didn't see any evidence of ghost activity.

242
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,449
Yeah, me neither.

243
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:55,394
Maybe they're being controlled somehow...
by something or someone.

244
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:57,172
You mean like "Willard"?

245
00:12:57,206 --> 00:12:58,792
Yeah, bugs instead of rats.

246
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:05,844
There are cases of psychic connections
between people and animals, elementals, telepaths.

247
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:07,944
Yeah, that whole Timmy/Lassie thing.

248
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:10,532
Larry's kid...

249
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:12,362
bugs for pets.

250
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,981
- Matt?
- Yeah.

251
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:19,186
- He did try to scare the realtor with a tarantula.
- Think he's our willard?

252
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:20,288
I don't know.

253
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:21,989
Anything's possible, I guess.

254
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,055
Ooh, hey, pull over here.

255
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,314
What are we doing here?

256
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:41,768
It's too late to talk to anybody else.

257
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:46,117
We're gonna squat in an empty house?

258
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:48,693
I want to try the steam shower. Come on.

259
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:50,476
Come on!

260
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:21,440
Atoko valley county
began mandatory insecticide

261
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:24,209
spraying across a wide swath of the district today.

262
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:29,982
Authorities say the decision to spray
was made because of several recent cases of west nile virus,

263
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,489
coupled with a dramatic increase
in the mosquito population in some areas.

264
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:39,292
Although some residents cite concerns
about the high levels of pesticide being used...

265
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:07,763
Aaah! Aaah!

266
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:38,570
You ever coming out of there?

267
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,640
What?!

268
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:42,887
- Dean, a police call came in on the scanner.
- Hold on.

269
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:45,800
Someone was found dead three blocks from here.
Come on.

270
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,838
This shower is awesome.

271
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:50,948
Come on.

272
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,328
Okay, look, I don't know anything more right now.

273
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,989
I'll have to call you back.

274
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:23,843
All right.

275
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,978
Hello, you're back early.

276
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:30,609
- Yeah, we wanted to take another look at the neighborhood.
- What's going on?

277
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:36,308
You guys met Linda Bloom at the barbecue?

278
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:37,322
The realtor.

279
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:38,936
Well, she, uh,

280
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,041
passed away last night.

281
00:16:42,496 --> 00:16:43,190
What happened?

282
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:45,839
I'm still trying to find out.

283
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:48,204
I identified the body for the police.

284
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:51,460
I'm sorry. This isn't a good time.

285
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:52,325
It's okay.

286
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:53,357
Excuse me.

287
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,052
You know what we have to do, right?

288
00:16:59,196 --> 00:17:01,786
- We got to get in that house.
- See if we got a bug problem.

289
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,902
This looks like the place.

290
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:45,468
Spiders.

291
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:47,374
From spider boy?

292
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:48,312
Matt.

293
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:50,905
Maybe.

294
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,633
Isn't his house that way?

295
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:16,642
Yep.

296
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:21,663
So where's he going?

297
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,545
Hey, Matt.

298
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:50,364
Remember me?

299
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:52,294
What are you doing out here?

300
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:53,784
We want to talk to you.

301
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,916
You're not here to buy a house, are you?

302
00:18:57,956 --> 00:18:58,718
Wait,

303
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,830
you're not serial killers?

304
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,281
No, no. No, I think you're safe.

305
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:05,651
So, Matt...

306
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:08,639
you sure know a lot about insects.

307
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:10,340
So?

308
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:13,681
Did you hear what happened to Linda, the realtor?

309
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:16,871
I hear she died this morning.

310
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:18,133
Mm, that's right.

311
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:19,740
Spider bites.

312
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:21,359
Matt,

313
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,526
you tried to scare her with a spider.

314
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:26,751
Wait,

315
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:28,874
you think I had something to do with that?

316
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,528
You tell us.

317
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:33,320
That tarantula was a joke.

318
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:37,408
Anyway, that wouldn't explain the bee attack
or the gas-company guy.

319
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:40,071
You know about those?

320
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:41,877
There is something going on here.

321
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:43,437
I don't know what,

322
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:44,020
but

323
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:46,261
something's happening with the insects.

324
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,008
Let me show you something.

325
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:58,858
So, if you knew about all this bug stuff,
why not tell your dad?

326
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,794
Maybe he could clear everybody out.

327
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,671
Believe me, I've tried, but

328
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,701
Larry doesn't listen to me.

329
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:05,604
Why not?

330
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:06,941
Mostly?

331
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,065
He's too disappointed in his freak son.

332
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:11,751
I hear ya.

333
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:13,202
You do?

334
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:16,662
Matt, how old are you?

335
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:17,530
16.

336
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:21,624
Well, don't sweat it 'cause in two years
something great's gonna happen.

337
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,617
- What?
- College.

338
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,714
You'll be able to get out of that house
and away from your dad.

339
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:29,802
What kind of advice is that?
A kid should stick with his family.

340
00:20:34,928 --> 00:20:35,961
How much further, Matt?

341
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:37,141
We're close.

342
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,671
I've been keeping track of the insect population.
It's

343
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,653
part of an A.P. Science class.

344
00:21:04,002 --> 00:21:05,269
You two are like peas in a pod.

345
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:08,257
What's been happening?

346
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:09,313
A lot.

347
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:12,527
I mean, from bees to earthworms,

348
00:21:12,957 --> 00:21:14,083
beetles...

349
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:15,690
you name it. It's

350
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:17,543
like they're congregating here.

351
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,259
Why?

352
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:19,701
I don't know.

353
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:23,112
What's that?

354
00:21:59,937 --> 00:22:01,122
There's something down there.

355
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:09,181
Oh, come on.

356
00:22:59,632 --> 00:23:02,385
So, a bunch of skeletons in an unmarked grave.

357
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:04,473
Yeah, maybe this is a haunting...

358
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:05,904
some pissed-off spirits,

359
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:08,542
- some unfinished business.
- Yeah, maybe.

360
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:10,583
The question is, why bugs

361
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,768
and why now?

362
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,703
That's two questions.

363
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:16,648
So, with that kid back there...

364
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:19,471
how could you tell him to just ditch his family like that?

365
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:20,879
Just, uh,

366
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:22,943
I know what the kid's going through.

367
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:26,751
- How about telling him to respect his old man? How's that for advice?
- Dean, come on.

368
00:23:27,455 --> 00:23:29,132
This isn't about his old man.

369
00:23:29,214 --> 00:23:30,517
You think I didn't respect dad.

370
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:31,854
That's what this is about.

371
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:34,464
Just forget it. Sorry I brought it up.

372
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:35,555
I respected him,

373
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:37,702
but no matter what I did,

374
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:39,192
it was never good enough.

375
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:41,972
- What are you saying, that dad was disappointed in you?
- Was?

376
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,153
Is...

377
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,757
- always has been.
- Why would you think that?

378
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:48,540
Because I didn't want to bow hunt

379
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:51,653
or hustle pool, because I wanted to go
to school and live my life,

380
00:23:51,668 --> 00:23:54,052
which in our whacked-out family made me the freak.

381
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:58,461
Yeah, you were kind of like the blond chick in "the munsters."

382
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,444
Dean,

383
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:03,728
you know what most dads are
when their kids score a full ride?

384
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:05,417
Proud.

385
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,112
Most dads don't toss their kids out of the house.

386
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:11,712
I remember that fight.

387
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:15,536
In fact, I seem to recall a few choice phrases
coming out of your mouth.

388
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:21,114
You know,

389
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,316
truth is, when we finally do find dad,

390
00:24:25,243 --> 00:24:27,272
I don't know if he's even gonna want to see me.

391
00:24:29,055 --> 00:24:31,056
Sam, dad was never disappointed in you.

392
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:32,980
Never.

393
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:35,432
He was scared.

394
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:37,328
What are you talking about?

395
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,038
He was afraid of what could have happened to you
if he wasn't around.

396
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,263
But even when you two weren't talking,

397
00:24:44,104 --> 00:24:46,345
he used to swing by Stanford whenever he could,

398
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:48,057
keep an eye on you,

399
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:50,087
make sure you were safe.

400
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:51,717
What?

401
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:53,778
Yeah.

402
00:24:57,943 --> 00:24:59,585
Why didn't he tell me any of that?

403
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:04,118
It's a two-way street, dude.
You could have picked up the phone.

404
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:11,736
Come on, we're gonna be late for our appointment.

405
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:21,566
So, you two are students?

406
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:23,058
Yeah.

407
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:25,416
Yeah, we're in your class.

408
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:26,965
Anthro 101.

409
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:28,525
Oh, yeah.

410
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:29,369
So,

411
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,410
what about the bones, Professor?

412
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:35,045
This is quite an interesting find you've made.

413
00:25:35,092 --> 00:25:39,139
I'd say they're 170 years old, give or take.

414
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:41,555
The time frame and the geography

415
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,498
heavily suggest native american.

416
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:47,281
Were there any tribes or reservations on that land?

417
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:50,061
Not according to the historical record,

418
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,059
but

419
00:25:51,493 --> 00:25:52,701
the, uh...

420
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:56,889
relocation of native peoples was quite common at that time.

421
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:57,874
Right.

422
00:25:58,678 --> 00:25:59,312
Well,

423
00:25:59,828 --> 00:26:01,364
are there any local legends,

424
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:03,793
oral histories about the area?

425
00:26:04,778 --> 00:26:05,963
Well...

426
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:10,139
you know, there's a euchee tribe in Sapulpa.

427
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,128
It's about 60 miles from here.

428
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:15,503
Someone out there might know the truth.

429
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:19,644
All right.

430
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:07,242
Joe Whitetree?

431
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:11,983
We'd like to ask you a few questions, if that's all right.

432
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:14,124
We're students from the university.

433
00:27:14,182 --> 00:27:16,235
No, you're not. You're lying.

434
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:19,074
Um,

435
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:22,464
- the truth is...
- You know who starts sentence with

436
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:23,669
"truth is"?

437
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:25,064
Liars.

438
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:31,722
Have you heard of Oasis Plains?

439
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:34,232
It's a housing development near the Atoka valley.

440
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:37,969
I like him.

441
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:39,893
He's not a liar.

442
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:42,157
I know the area.

443
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:45,535
What can you tell us about the history there?

444
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:46,775
Why do you want to know?

445
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:48,687
Something...

446
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,153
something bad

447
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:52,992
is happening in Oasis Plains.

448
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:57,654
We think it might have something to do
with some old bones we found down there...

449
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:00,329
native american bones.

450
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:07,503
I'll tell you what my grandfather told me,

451
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:10,107
what his grandfather told him.

452
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,335
200 years ago,

453
00:28:12,602 --> 00:28:15,335
a band of my ancestors lived in that valley.

454
00:28:16,086 --> 00:28:19,687
One day, the american calvary came to relocate them.

455
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,365
They were resistant...

456
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:26,665
calvary impatient.

457
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,019
As my grandfather put it,

458
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:31,887
on a night,

459
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:33,060
the moon

460
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:34,350
and the sun

461
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,872
shared the sky as equals,

462
00:28:38,162 --> 00:28:40,848
the calvary first raided our village.

463
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:42,499
They murdered,

464
00:28:43,202 --> 00:28:44,035
raped.

465
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:47,470
The next day, the calvary came again,

466
00:28:47,752 --> 00:28:49,851
and the next and the next.

467
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,347
And on the sixth night, the calvary came one last time,

468
00:28:54,492 --> 00:28:56,510
and by the time the sun rose,

469
00:28:56,686 --> 00:28:58,820
every man, woman, and child

470
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:00,624
still in the village

471
00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:02,008
was dead.

472
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,455
They say on the sixth night,

473
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:11,212
as the chief of the village lay dying,

474
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:13,440
he whispered to the heavens

475
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,616
that no white man would ever tarnish this land again.

476
00:29:18,536 --> 00:29:19,545
Nature

477
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,105
would rise up

478
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:23,357
and protect the valley,

479
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:26,606
and it would bring as many days of misery and death

480
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:28,326
to the white man

481
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:31,106
as the calvary had brought upon his people.

482
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:33,992
Insects.

483
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,299
That sounds like nature to me.

484
00:29:37,848 --> 00:29:38,915
Six days?

485
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:41,285
And on the night of the sixth day,

486
00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:43,814
none would survive.

487
00:29:52,243 --> 00:29:54,155
When did the gas-company man die?

488
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,744
Let's see, we got here tuesday, so friday the 20th.

489
00:29:58,265 --> 00:29:59,168
March 20th.

490
00:30:00,118 --> 00:30:01,549
That's the spring equinox.

491
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:04,611
The night, the sun and the moon share the sky as equals.

492
00:30:04,707 --> 00:30:08,542
So every year about this time,
anybody in Oasis Plains is in danger.

493
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:12,796
- Larry built his neighborhood on cursed land.
- And on the sixth night... that's tonight.

494
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:16,550
If we don't do something,
Larry's family will be dead by sunrise.

495
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:19,303
So how do we break a curse?

496
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:20,769
You don't break a curse.

497
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,350
You get out of its way.
We got to get those people out now.

498
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:44,579
Yes, mr. Pike, there's a main-line gas leak
in your neighborhood.

499
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:46,209
God, really? And how big?

500
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:49,060
Well, it's fairly extensive. I don't want to alarm you,
but

501
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:53,001
we need your family out of the vicinity
for at least 12 hours or so, just to be safe.

502
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:54,148
And who is this again?

503
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:56,940
Travis Weaver. I work for Oklahoma gas and power.

504
00:31:56,987 --> 00:31:57,561
Uh-huh.

505
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,606
The problemis I know Travis. He's worked with us for a year.
So who is this?

506
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:03,152
Uh...

507
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:05,886
give me the phone.

508
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:15,509
Hello?

509
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:16,623
Matt, it's Sam.

510
00:32:16,905 --> 00:32:18,907
Sam, my backyard's crawling with cockroaches.

511
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:22,356
Matt, just listen. You have to get your family
out of that house right now, okay?

512
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:23,502
What, why?

513
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,639
Because something's coming.

514
00:32:26,296 --> 00:32:27,132
More bugs.

515
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,738
Yeah, a lot more.

516
00:32:29,828 --> 00:32:31,922
My dad doesn't listen in the best of circumstances.

517
00:32:31,942 --> 00:32:34,889
- What am I supposed to tell him?
- You got to make him listen, okay?

518
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:36,321
Give me the phone. Give me the phone!

519
00:32:36,532 --> 00:32:39,679
Matt, under no circumstances are you to tell the truth.
He'll just think you're nuts.

520
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:42,332
- But he's my...
- Tell him you have a sharp pain in your right side,

521
00:32:42,391 --> 00:32:43,952
and you got to go to the hospital, okay?

522
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,774
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

523
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:50,658
"Make him listen."

524
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:52,454
What are you thinking?

525
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:06,126
Damn it, they're still here.
Come on.

526
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:16,137
Get off my property before I call the cops!

527
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:17,863
- Mr. Pike, listen.
- Dad,

528
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:19,389
they're just trying to help.

529
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:20,493
Get in the house!

530
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:22,712
Sorry. I told him the truth.

531
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,602
We had a plan, Matt. What happened to the plan?

532
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:27,020
Look, it's twelve a.m.

533
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:28,558
They are coming any minute now.

534
00:33:28,617 --> 00:33:31,704
You need to get your family and go before it's too late.

535
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:33,830
Oh, yeah, you mean before the biblical swarm.

536
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:36,437
What do you think really happened
to that realtor, huh?

537
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:37,975
And the gas-company guy?

538
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:40,240
You don't think something weird's going on around here?

539
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,673
Look, I don't know who you are, but you're crazy.

540
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:45,146
You come near my boy or my family again,

541
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:46,318
we're gonna have a problem.

542
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:49,037
- Well, I hate to be a downer, but we got a problem right now.
- Dad, they're right.

543
00:33:49,256 --> 00:33:50,188
We're in danger.

544
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,163
Matt, get inside now!

545
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:54,583
Why won't you listen to me?!

546
00:33:54,673 --> 00:33:57,043
Because this is crazy! It doesn't make any sense!

547
00:33:57,366 --> 00:33:57,900
Look,

548
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,768
this land is cursed.

549
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:03,510
People have died here.
Are you gonna really take that risk with your family?

550
00:34:03,522 --> 00:34:04,033
Wait.

551
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:06,926
You hear it?

552
00:34:11,346 --> 00:34:12,405
What the hell?

553
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:19,077
It's time to go. Larry, get your wife.

554
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:20,219
Guys.

555
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:25,536
Oh, my god.

556
00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:28,826
We'll never make it.

557
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:30,854
Everybody in the house.
Everybody in the house!

558
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,739
Let's go!

559
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:38,858
- Is there anyone else in the neighborhood?
- No, it's just us.

560
00:34:39,497 --> 00:34:40,699
Honey, what's happening?

561
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:42,303
What's that noise?

562
00:34:43,468 --> 00:34:44,437
Call 911.

563
00:34:45,256 --> 00:34:46,133
Joanie!

564
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,020
Okay.

565
00:34:48,275 --> 00:34:49,870
I need towels.

566
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:53,242
We got to lock this place up.
Come on, doors, windows, the fireplace, everything. Okay?

567
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:54,954
Phones are dead.

568
00:34:55,035 --> 00:34:56,393
They must have chewed through the phone lines.

569
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:03,597
And the power lines.

570
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:04,691
Maybe my cell.

571
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:08,946
No signal.

572
00:35:09,513 --> 00:35:10,487
You won't get one.

573
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,880
They're blanketing the house.

574
00:35:29,897 --> 00:35:30,955
So, what do we do now?

575
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:32,673
We try to outlast it.

576
00:35:34,711 --> 00:35:37,469
- Hopefully the curse will end at sunrise.
- Hopefully?

577
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:02,270
- Bug spray?
- Trust me.

578
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:05,776
What is that?

579
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:17,161
The flue.

580
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:21,748
I think everybody needs to get upstairs.

581
00:36:32,968 --> 00:36:35,226
Everybody upstairs now!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

582
00:36:38,607 --> 00:36:39,956
Quick!

583
00:36:48,763 --> 00:36:51,248
Okay, Joanie, go, go, go.

584
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:52,236
Matt, go.

585
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:54,888
Hurry!

586
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:02,652
- You in?
- Yeah.

587
00:37:05,812 --> 00:37:07,574
Come on!

588
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:15,582
My god, what's that?!

589
00:37:21,915 --> 00:37:23,161
Something's eating through the wood.

590
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:25,428
Termites.

591
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,259
All right, everybody get back.

592
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:32,856
Get back! Get back!

593
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:33,456
Get back!

594
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,318
Matt.

595
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:39,492
Huddle together. Cover your faces.

596
00:38:50,252 --> 00:38:51,015
Look!

597
00:39:52,382 --> 00:39:53,328
What, no goodbye?

598
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:54,694
Good timing.

599
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:56,278
Another hour and we'd have been gone.

600
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:57,449
For good?

601
00:39:58,388 --> 00:39:58,998
Yeah.

602
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:02,820
The development's been put on hold while the government investigates
those bones you found,

603
00:40:03,255 --> 00:40:04,644
but I'm gonna make damn sure

604
00:40:04,774 --> 00:40:05,908
no one lives here again.

605
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,152
You don't seem too upset about it.

606
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:12,621
Well, this has been the biggest financial disaster
of my career, but,

607
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:15,158
somehow...

608
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:18,366
I really don't care.

609
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:34,560
What's this?

610
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:35,618
I don't know.

611
00:40:36,827 --> 00:40:37,510
They

612
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:39,109
kind of weird me out now.

613
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,090
Yeah, I should hope so.

614
00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:05,197
I want to find dad.

615
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:07,807
Yeah, me too.

616
00:41:09,421 --> 00:41:10,525
Yeah, but I just...

617
00:41:13,915 --> 00:41:15,341
I want to apologize to him.

618
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:19,508
For what?

619
00:41:22,082 --> 00:41:23,793
All the things I said to him.

620
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,115
He was just doing the best he could.

621
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:33,090
Well, don't worry, we'll find him,

622
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:35,752
and you'll apologize,

623
00:41:36,573 --> 00:41:39,196
and within five minutes, you guys will
beat each other's throats.

624
00:41:43,274 --> 00:41:45,116
Yeah, probably.

625
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,444
- Let's hit the road.
- Let's.
