1
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,720
Great.

2
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:27,109
Meredith.

3
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:35,147
Meredith.

4
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:37,397
Hello?

5
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:52,023
Meredith.

6
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:00,401
Meredith.

7
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:34,574
System disarmed.

8
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:38,993
System armed.

9
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,166
Hey, Meredith, it's Kristin.

10
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:10,066
You have to tell me what happened
last night. Call me.

11
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:12,325
Hey Meredith, it's Dereck.

12
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:13,975
Where have you been?
I've tried to get you all day

13
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,264
'cause I got maybe something's
gonna please you.

14
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:18,374
Guess what. Call me when you come back, ok?

15
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:22,323
So if you wanna solve that mystery,
call me. Alright. Bye.

16
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:25,092
Hey, Meredith. Listen,

17
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:04,094
All right, Dean,

18
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:05,593
this is the place.

19
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:09,103
I've got to say dad and me did just fine
without these stupid costumes.

20
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:10,782
I feel like a

21
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:12,992
high-school-drama dork.

22
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:16,541
What was that play that you did?

23
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:18,290
What was it... "Our Town".

24
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,230
Yeah, you were good.
It was cute.

25
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,945
Look, you want to pull this off or not?

26
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,489
I'm just saying these outfits
cost hard-earned money.

27
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:25,609
- Whose?
- Ours.

28
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:27,358
You think credit-card fraud is easy?

29
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:32,387
Thanks for letting us look around.

30
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:35,117
The police said they were done
with the place, so...

31
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:48,254
You guys said
you were with the alarm company?

32
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:49,863
That's right.

33
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,158
Well, no offense, but

34
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:53,653
your alarm is about
as useful as boobs on a man.

35
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:55,812
Well, that's why we're here,

36
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:58,511
to see what went wrong,
to stop it from happening again.

37
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,521
Now, ma'am, you found the body?

38
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:03,210
Yeah.

39
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,040
Right after it happened?

40
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,915
No, a few days later.

41
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,019
Meredith's work called.
She hadn't showed up.

42
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,669
I knocked on her door.

43
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,518
That's when I noticed...

44
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:13,938
the smell.

45
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:15,158
Any windows open?

46
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:16,477
Any sign of break-in?

47
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:18,657
Windows were locked.
Front door was bolted.

48
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,526
Chain was on the door.
We had to cut it to get in.

49
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:21,566
And the alarm was still on?

50
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:22,666
Like I said.

51
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:24,436
Bang-up job your company is doing.

52
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,425
Did you see any overturned furniture,
broken glass, signs of struggle?

53
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:30,894
Everything was in perfect condition...

54
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:33,654
except Meredith.

55
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:36,653
Well, what condition was Meredith in?

56
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:38,722
Meredith was all over,

57
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:39,842
in pieces.

58
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:42,951
The guy who killed her
must have been a whack job.

59
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:44,951
But I tell you,
if I didn't know any better,

60
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,011
I'd have said a wild animal did it.

61
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,769
Ma'am,

62
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:54,499
you mind if we take some time,
give this place a once-over?

63
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,998
Go right ahead.

64
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,708
Knock yourself out.

65
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:05,286
So the killer walks in and out
of the apartment...

66
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:07,356
- no weapons, no prints, nothing.
- I'm telling you,

67
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:10,415
the minute I found that article,
I knew this was our kind of gig.

68
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:12,455
I think I agree with you.

69
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:14,524
So, you talked to the cops?

70
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:18,573
Uh, yeah, I spoke to Amy...

71
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,978
a, uh, charming, perky officer of the law.

72
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,002
- What did you find out?
- Well, she's a sagittarius.

73
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:26,432
She loves tequila. I mean...

74
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,201
Oh, and she's got this little tattoo.

75
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,826
- Dean!
- What? Yeah.

76
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:32,700
Nothing we don't already know,

77
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,110
except for one thing they're
keeping out of the papers.

78
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,589
Meredith's heart was missing.

79
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,568
Her heart?

80
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:42,308
Yeah, her heart.

81
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,578
So, what do you think did it to her?

82
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:46,917
The landlady said
it looked like an animal attack.

83
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:48,097
Maybe it was.

84
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:49,916
- Werewolf?
- Not a werewolf.

85
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:51,256
The lunar cycle's not right.

86
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,965
Plus, if it was a creature, it would've left
some kind of trace.

87
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:56,155
It was probably a spirit.

88
00:06:59,254 --> 00:07:01,644
See if you can find
any masking tape around.

89
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:26,428
Ever see that symbol before?

90
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,478
Never.

91
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:30,977
Me, neither.

92
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:53,162
I want to step on your hands
and cut the rope

93
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:56,731
and the twine tangled up
on your mind, love

94
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,671
On the outside.

95
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:00,161
On the hillside.

96
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:03,820
We can play with the paste all night.

97
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,239
I talked to the bartender.

98
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:06,449
Did you get anything...

99
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:08,139
besides her number?

100
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:08,864
Dude,

101
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:11,168
I'm a professional.
I'm offended that...

102
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:12,378
you would think that.

103
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:15,697
All right.

104
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,366
You mind doing a little bit of thinking
with your upstairs brain, Dean?

105
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:20,136
Hmm?

106
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:22,770
There's nothing to find out.
Meredith worked here.

107
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:24,615
She waited tables.
Everyone here is her friends.

108
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,720
Everyone says she's normal.

109
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,184
She didn't do or say anything
weird before she died. So...

110
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:30,254
What about that symbol?
Did you find anything?

111
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:31,214
Nope. Nothing.

112
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:33,613
It wasn't in dad's journal
or in any of the usual books.

113
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:34,733
I just have to

114
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:36,312
dig a little deeper, I guess.

115
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:39,192
There was a first victim, right,
before Meredith?

116
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,451
Right, yeah. His name was, uh...

117
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:43,581
his name was Ben Swardstrom.

118
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:46,470
Last month he was found mutilated
in his town house.

119
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,680
Same deal. The door was locked.
The alarm was on.

120
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,599
- Is there any connection between them?
- Nothing I could tell.

121
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:52,029
I mean not yet, at least.

122
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,168
Ben was a banker. Meredith was a waitress.

123
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:56,198
They never met, never knew anyone in common.

124
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,728
They were practically from different worlds.

125
00:08:57,768 --> 00:09:02,517
So, to recap, the only successful intel we've scored
so far is the bartender's phone number.

126
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:06,236
What?

127
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:09,905
Sam!

128
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:17,143
Well, we talked about you and
we've heard about you...

129
00:09:17,713 --> 00:09:18,913
Meg.

130
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:20,353
Sam!

131
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:27,101
Sam, is that you?

132
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:28,581
Oh, my gosh!

133
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,320
What are you doing here?

134
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,409
I'm just in town... visiting friends.

135
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:38,968
Where are they?

136
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,918
Well, they're not here right now,

137
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,388
but what about you, Meg?

138
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,017
I thought you were going to California.

139
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,477
I did.

140
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:47,696
I came. I saw. I conquered.

141
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:49,876
Oh, and I met what's his name...

142
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:52,095
something Michael Murray, at a bar.

143
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:53,470
Who?

144
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:54,640
It doesn't matter.

145
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:59,084
Anyway, the whole scene got old,
so I'm living here for a while.

146
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:02,993
- You're from Chicago?
- No, Massachusetts.

147
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:04,133
Andover.

148
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:05,782
Gosh, Sam,

149
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:07,926
what are the odds we'd run into each other?

150
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:09,961
I know. I thought I'd never see you again.

151
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,391
Well, I'm glad you were wrong.

152
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,370
Dude, cover your mouth.

153
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,099
Yeah, I'm sorry, Meg. This is, um...

154
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:23,458
This is my brother, Dean.

155
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:26,718
- This is Dean?
- Yeah.

156
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:27,812
So you've heard of me?

157
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:29,707
Oh, yeah, I've heard of you.

158
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:30,707
Nice,

159
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,276
the way you treat your brother like luggage.

160
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:36,885
- Sorry?
- Why don't you let him do what he wants to do?

161
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:39,595
Stop dragging him over god's green earth.

162
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,134
Meg... it's all right.

163
00:10:45,553 --> 00:10:47,253
Okay. Awkward.

164
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:49,273
I'm gonna get a drink now.

165
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:55,971
Sam, I'm sorry.

166
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:57,891
It's just,

167
00:10:57,911 --> 00:10:59,840
the way you told me he treats you,

168
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,960
- if it were me, I'd kill him.
- It's all right.

169
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,199
He means well.

170
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:06,614
- We should hook up while you're in town.
- Yeah.

171
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:09,038
- I could show you a hell of a time.
- That sounds great.

172
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:11,318
Why don't you give me your number?

173
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:15,417
312-555-0143.

174
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:17,266
You know what? I never got your last name.

175
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,556
- Masters.
- Masters?

176
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:19,746
So you better call.

177
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:21,105
Scout's honor.

178
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:25,234
I hope to see you around, Sam.

179
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:35,867
Who the hell was she?

180
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:37,922
I don't really know. I only met her once.

181
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:40,251
Meeting up with her again?

182
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,241
I don't know, man. It's weird.

183
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,900
What was she saying...

184
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:46,410
I treat you like luggage?

185
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,149
Were you bitching about me to some chick?

186
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,519
Look, I'm sorry, Dean.
It was when we had that huge fight

187
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:52,268
when I was in the bus stop in Indiana.

188
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:53,253
But that's not important.

189
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:54,818
Is there any truth to what she's saying?

190
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:56,347
Am I keeping you against your will, Sam?

191
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:58,117
No, of course not. Now, would you listen?

192
00:11:58,127 --> 00:11:59,097
What?!

193
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:02,636
I think there's something strange
going on here, Dean.

194
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:04,545
Tell me about it. She wasn't even into me.

195
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,445
No, man, I mean, like our kind of strange.

196
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:08,035
- Like maybe even a lead.
- Why do you say that?

197
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,459
I met Meg weeks ago

198
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:10,844
literally on the side of the road.

199
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:13,374
Now I run into her in some random
Chicago bar...

200
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:16,563
the same bar where a waitress
was slaughtered by something supernatural.

201
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:17,573
You don't think that's a little weird?

202
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,042
I don't know, random coincidence,
it happens.

203
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,872
Well, yeah, it happens, but not to us.

204
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,391
Look, I could be wrong. I'm just saying
that there's something about this girl

205
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:25,781
that I can't quite put my finger on.

206
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,210
But I bet you'd like to.

207
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,464
But maybe she's not a suspect.
Maybe you got a thing for her, huh?

208
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,389
Maybe you're thinking too much with
your upstairs brain, huh?

209
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:35,959
Do me a favor.

210
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,898
Check and see if there's really
a Meg Masters from Andover, Massachusetts

211
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:41,727
and see if you can't dig anything up
on that symbol on Meredith's floor.

212
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,257
What are you gonna do?

213
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:45,076
I'm gonna watch Meg.

214
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:47,256
I just want to see what's what.
Better safe than sorry.

215
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,706
All right, you little pervert.

216
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:50,055
I'm going. I'm going.

217
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,455
Hey.

218
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,999
Let me guess. You're lurking outside that
poor girl's apartment, aren't you?

219
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:18,969
No.

220
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:22,413
Yes.

221
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:24,128
You've got a funny way of showing
your affection.

222
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:25,445
You find anything on her or what?

223
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,727
Sorry man, I should check this out.

224
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:28,777
There's a Meg Masters in the
Andover phone book.

225
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:29,801
I even pulled up her high-school photo.

226
00:13:29,836 --> 00:13:31,696
Now, look, why don't you go
knock on her door

227
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:33,431
and invite her to a

228
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:35,405
poetry reading or whatever it is you do.

229
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:39,104
What about the symbol? Any luck?

230
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:41,434
Yeah, that I did have some luck with.

231
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:44,313
Turns out it's zoroastrian.

232
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:47,562
Very, very old-school,
like 2,000 years before Christ.

233
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:48,922
It's a sigil for a Daeva.

234
00:13:49,382 --> 00:13:52,071
- What's a Daeva?
- It translates to "demon of darkness"...

235
00:13:52,106 --> 00:13:54,991
zoroastrian demons,
and they're savage, animalistic,

236
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,160
nasty attitudes;
kind of like demonic pit bulls.

237
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,190
- How did you figure that out?
- Give me some credit, man.

238
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,169
You don't have a corner on paper
chasing around here.

239
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,129
Name the last book you read.

240
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:08,368
I called dad's friend, Caleb.
He told me, all right.

241
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:10,887
Anyway, here's the thing.
These Daevas, they have to be summoned.

242
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:11,712
Conjured.

243
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:13,131
So someone's controlling it?

244
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,516
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

245
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:17,056
And from what I gather,
it's pretty risky business, too.

246
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,705
These suckers tend to bite the hand
that feeds them...

247
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,660
and the arm and the torsos.

248
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,334
- So what do they look like?
- Nobody knows.

249
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:25,024
Nobody's seen them for a couple
of millennia.

250
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,806
Summoning a demon that ancient,

251
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,553
someone really knows their stuff.

252
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:30,603
I think we've got a major player in town.

253
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:33,912
Why don't you go give that girl
a private strip-o-gram?

254
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:35,562
- Bite me.
- Bite her.

255
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:37,751
Don't leave teeth marks, though. It's not...

256
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:38,781
Sam?

257
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:09,834
- No, no, I'm just...
- Pervert!

258
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:02,505
I don't think you should come

259
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:04,830
because the brothers,

260
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,744
they're in town. I didn't know that...

261
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:13,853
Yes, sir.

262
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:16,242
Yes, I'll be here...

263
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:18,901
waiting for you.

264
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,073
What the hell?

265
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,321
Dude, I've got to talk to you.

266
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:53,310
So, hot little Meg is summoning the Daeva?

267
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,870
It looks like she was using that black altar
to control the thing.

268
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,029
So Sammy's got a thing for the bad girl.

269
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,718
- And what's the deal with that bowl again?
- She was talking into it...

270
00:20:01,753 --> 00:20:04,868
the way witches used to scry
into crystal balls or animal entrails.

271
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:06,157
She was communicating with someone.

272
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,906
- With who? With the Daeva?
- No, you said those things were savages.

273
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:12,456
No, this was someone different,

274
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:15,325
someone who's giving her orders, someone

275
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:17,915
who's coming to that warehouse.

276
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:26,863
Holy crap.

277
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:28,212
What?

278
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:30,002
What I was gonna tell you earlier.

279
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:31,961
I pulled a favor with my...

280
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:35,081
friend Amy, over at the police department.

281
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:37,240
The complete records of the two victims.

282
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,990
We missed something the first time.

283
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,360
What?

284
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:44,139
The first victim, the old man?

285
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:46,058
He spent his whole life in Chicago,
but he wasn't born here.

286
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:47,398
Look where he was born.

287
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:49,897
Lawrence, Kansas.

288
00:20:51,137 --> 00:20:53,037
Meredith, the second victim?

289
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:55,826
It turns out she was adopted.
And guess where she's from?

290
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:04,444
Holy crap.

291
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:05,504
Yeah.

292
00:21:05,604 --> 00:21:07,993
I mean, that is where the demon killed mom.

293
00:21:08,003 --> 00:21:09,388
That's where everything started.

294
00:21:09,423 --> 00:21:10,972
You think Meg's tied up with the demon?

295
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:12,522
I think it's a definite possibility.

296
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:14,682
But I don't understand!
What's the significance of Lawrence?

297
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:17,351
And how do these Daeva things fit in?

298
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:21,160
I say we trash that black altar, grab Meg,
and have ourselves a friendly little interrogation.

299
00:21:21,195 --> 00:21:22,500
No, we can't.

300
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,160
We shouldn't tip her off.

301
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,809
We've got to stake out that warehouse.
We've got to see who...

302
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:29,009
or what, is showing up to meet her.

303
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:30,068
I'll tell you one thing.

304
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:32,218
I don't think we should do this alone.

305
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:37,577
We think we've got a serious lead
on the thing that killed mom.

306
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:39,166
So, uh,

307
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:40,356
this warehouse... it's

308
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,696
1435 west erie.

309
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:45,430
Dad, if you get this,

310
00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:47,245
get to Chicago as soon as you can.

311
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:49,474
Voice mail?

312
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:50,974
Yeah.

313
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,033
Jeez.

314
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:54,193
What'd you get?

315
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,732
I ransacked that trunk...

316
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:59,222
holy water, every weapon
that I could think of.

317
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:02,671
Exorcism rituals from about
a half-dozen religions.

318
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:07,680
I'm not sure what to expect, so I guess
we should just expect everything, huh?

319
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:18,977
It's a big night.

320
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:19,917
Yeah.

321
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,737
You nervous?

322
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:24,436
No.

323
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:25,996
Are you?

324
00:22:26,486 --> 00:22:28,235
No. No way.

325
00:22:36,373 --> 00:22:39,763
God, could you imagine if we actually
found that damn thing, that demon?

326
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:41,712
Let's not get ahead of ourselves,
all right?

327
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:43,152
I know. I'm just saying...

328
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:44,832
what if we did?

329
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:48,091
What if this whole thing was over tonight?

330
00:22:48,741 --> 00:22:50,700
Man, I'd sleep for a month,

331
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,730
go back to school, just

332
00:22:52,765 --> 00:22:54,769
be a person again.

333
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,609
- You want to go back to school?
- Yeah,

334
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:58,998
once we're done hunting the thing.

335
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:00,748
Huh.

336
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,197
Why? Is there something wrong with that?

337
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:06,617
No, no, it's great. Good for you.

338
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:09,231
I mean,

339
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:12,255
- what are you gonna do when it's all over?
- It's never gonna be over.

340
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:14,185
There's gonna be others.

341
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:15,695
There's always gonna be something to hunt.

342
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:18,119
But there's got to be something that
you want for yourself.

343
00:23:18,154 --> 00:23:20,524
Yeah, I don't want you to leave the second
this is over, Sam.

344
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:22,448
Dude,

345
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:23,883
what's your problem?

346
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:33,081
Why do you think I drag you everywhere?

347
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,060
Why do you think I came and got you
at Stanford in the first place?

348
00:23:37,095 --> 00:23:38,659
'Cause dad was in trouble.

349
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,109
'Cause you wanted to find the thing
that killed mom.

350
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:43,378
Yes, that, but it's more than that, man.

351
00:23:48,897 --> 00:23:52,096
You and me and dad...

352
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:54,791
I want us to...

353
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:56,615
to be together again.

354
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:01,534
I want us to be a family again.

355
00:24:01,544 --> 00:24:02,624
Dean,

356
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,178
we are a family.

357
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:07,053
I'd do anything for you.

358
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:10,892
But things will never be the way
they were before.

359
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:16,971
They could be.

360
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,439
I don't want them to be.

361
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:29,368
I'm not gonna live this life forever.

362
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:32,837
Dean, when this is all over,

363
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:36,077
you're gonna have to let me go
my own way.

364
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:36,313
Guys.

365
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:39,202
Hiding is a little bit childish,
don't you think?

366
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:41,442
That didn't work out like I'd planned.

367
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:45,871
Why don't you come out?

368
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,049
Sam,

369
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:59,258
I have to say, this puts a real crimp
in our relationship.

370
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:00,558
Yeah, tell me about it.

371
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:01,727
So,

372
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,457
where's your little Daeva friend?

373
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:05,706
Around.

374
00:26:05,986 --> 00:26:08,106
And that shotgun's not gonna do much good.

375
00:26:08,116 --> 00:26:09,586
Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.

376
00:26:09,596 --> 00:26:11,225
The shotgun's not for the demon.

377
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,965
So, who is it, Meg?

378
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:14,514
Who's coming?

379
00:26:14,524 --> 00:26:16,354
Who are you waiting for?

380
00:26:17,444 --> 00:26:18,733
You.

381
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,617
Hey, Sam,

382
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:52,516
don't take this the wrong way,
but your girlfriend...

383
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:54,066
is a bitch.

384
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,605
This,

385
00:26:57,035 --> 00:26:59,134
the whole thing, was a trap.

386
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:02,874
Running into you at the bar,

387
00:27:03,153 --> 00:27:04,983
following you here,

388
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:06,893
hearing what you had to say...

389
00:27:06,903 --> 00:27:08,722
it was all a set up, wasn't it?

390
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:11,702
And that the victims were from Lawrence.

391
00:27:11,737 --> 00:27:13,201
It doesn't mean anything.

392
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:15,591
It was just to draw you in, that's all.

393
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:19,700
- You killed those two people for nothing.
- Baby, I've killed a lot more for a lot less.

394
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,009
You trapped us.

395
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:24,389
Good for you.

396
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:26,548
It's miller time.

397
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:28,728
Why don't you kill us already?

398
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:31,867
Not very quick on the up take, are we?

399
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:38,895
This trap isn't for you.

400
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:43,724
Dad.

401
00:27:44,444 --> 00:27:46,034
It's a trap for dad.

402
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:49,933
Oh, sweetheart,

403
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:51,962
you're dumber than you look.

404
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:54,887
'Cause even if dad was in town,
which he is not,

405
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:57,221
he wouldn't walk into something like this.
He's too good.

406
00:27:57,256 --> 00:27:59,841
He is pretty good, I'll give you that.

407
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:07,549
But you see...

408
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:14,937
he has one weakness.

409
00:28:14,972 --> 00:28:16,197
What's that?

410
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:17,557
You.

411
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:21,846
He lets his guard down around his boys,

412
00:28:22,206 --> 00:28:24,935
lets his emotions cloud his judgment.

413
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:29,644
I happen to know he is in town,

414
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:32,173
and he'll come

415
00:28:32,183 --> 00:28:33,623
and try to save you.

416
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:36,422
And then the Daevas will kill everybody...

417
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:39,292
nice and slow...

418
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:41,661
and messy.

419
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:43,411
Well, I've got news for you.

420
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:45,420
It's gonna take a lot more than some...

421
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,020
shadow to kill him.

422
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,860
Oh, the Daevas are in the room here.

423
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:49,914
They're invisible.

424
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:52,389
Their shadows are just the only part
you can see.

425
00:28:52,424 --> 00:28:53,539
Why are you doing this, Meg?

426
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:56,338
What kind of deal you got worked out
here, huh...

427
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,827
- and with who?
- I'm doing this for the same reasons you do what you do.

428
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:02,597
Loyalty,

429
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,056
love.

430
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:07,615
Like the love you had for mommy...

431
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,785
and Jess.

432
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:10,605
Go to hell.

433
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:13,584
Baby, I'm already there.

434
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:17,833
Come on, Sam.

435
00:29:18,513 --> 00:29:20,513
There's no need to be nasty.

436
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:27,991
I think we both know...

437
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:31,410
how you really feel about me.

438
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,699
You know...

439
00:29:39,718 --> 00:29:40,918
I saw you...

440
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:43,397
watching me...

441
00:29:43,987 --> 00:29:46,177
changing in my apartment.

442
00:29:46,627 --> 00:29:48,666
It turned you on, didn't it?

443
00:29:49,716 --> 00:29:52,115
- Get a room, you two.
- I didn't mind.

444
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,355
I liked that you were watching me.

445
00:29:54,895 --> 00:29:56,584
Come on, Sammy,

446
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,404
you and I can still have a little dirty fun.

447
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:01,043
You want to have fun?

448
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:02,988
Go ahead, then.

449
00:30:03,023 --> 00:30:05,243
I'm a little tied up right now.

450
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:41,424
Now, were you just trying to distract me

451
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:43,744
while your brother cuts free?

452
00:30:44,214 --> 00:30:45,254
No.

453
00:30:46,743 --> 00:30:47,803
No.

454
00:30:49,373 --> 00:30:51,752
It was because I have a knife of my own.

455
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,921
Sam! Get the altar!

456
00:31:34,902 --> 00:31:37,672
So, I guess the Daevas
didn't like being bossed around.

457
00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:39,811
I guess not.

458
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:41,931
Hey, Sam?

459
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:44,430
The next time you want to get laid,

460
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,859
find a girl that's not
so buckets of crazy, huh?

461
00:32:02,276 --> 00:32:04,386
Why don't you just leave that stuff
in the car?

462
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:06,435
I said it before, and I'll say it again...

463
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,935
better safe than sorry.

464
00:32:13,784 --> 00:32:14,713
Hey!

465
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:28,070
Dad.

466
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,680
Hey, boys.

467
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:58,434
Hi, Sam.

468
00:32:58,444 --> 00:32:59,853
Hi, dad.

469
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,032
Dad, it was a trap.

470
00:33:06,642 --> 00:33:08,491
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

471
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:09,991
It's all right.

472
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:12,001
I thought it might have been.

473
00:33:12,036 --> 00:33:12,840
Were you there?

474
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,990
I got there just in time to see the girl
take the swan dive.

475
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:19,119
She was the bad guy, right?

476
00:33:19,154 --> 00:33:20,589
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

477
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:21,918
Well,

478
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:25,278
it doesn't surprise me.
It's tried to stop me before.

479
00:33:26,347 --> 00:33:28,677
- The demon has?
- It knows I'm close.

480
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:30,546
It knows I'm gonna kill it.

481
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:33,406
Not just exorcise it or send it
back to Hell,

482
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,225
actually kill it.

483
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:38,315
How?

484
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,074
I'm working on that.

485
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:44,243
Let us come with you. We'll help.

486
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:46,863
No, Sam.

487
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:49,432
Not yet.

488
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:50,872
Listen, try to understand.

489
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,961
This demon is a scary son of a bitch.

490
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:56,965
I don't want you caught in the crossfire.

491
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,200
- I don't want you hurt.
- You don't have to worry about us.

492
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,949
Of course I do.

493
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,579
I'm your father.

494
00:34:09,718 --> 00:34:11,247
Listen, Sammy,

495
00:34:11,897 --> 00:34:14,526
the last time we were together,
we had one hell of a fight.

496
00:34:14,816 --> 00:34:15,866
Yes, sir.

497
00:34:23,214 --> 00:34:24,904
It's good to see you again.

498
00:34:26,204 --> 00:34:27,813
It's been a long time.

499
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,443
Too long.

500
00:34:58,047 --> 00:34:59,416
No!

501
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:35,728
Shot your ass!

502
00:35:37,238 --> 00:35:39,077
These things are shadow demons,

503
00:35:39,147 --> 00:35:40,697
so let's light 'em up!

504
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:56,224
Dad!

505
00:35:56,524 --> 00:35:57,613
Over here!

506
00:36:21,828 --> 00:36:22,918
Come on!

507
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:28,126
All right, come on. We don't have much time.

508
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:30,186
As soon as the flare's out, they'll be back.

509
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:31,656
Wait, wait!

510
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:33,585
Sam, wait.

511
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:39,754
- Dad, you can't come with us.
- What?

512
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:41,463
What are you talking about?

513
00:36:41,473 --> 00:36:42,703
You boys...

514
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:44,903
- you're beat to hell.
- We'll be all right.

515
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,792
Dean, we should stick together!

516
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:49,662
- We'll go after those...
- Sam, listen to me!

517
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:54,790
We almost got dad killed in there.

518
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,670
Don't you understand?
They're not gonna stop.

519
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,479
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.

520
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:02,509
I mean, Meg was right.

521
00:37:03,698 --> 00:37:05,778
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.

522
00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:08,367
He...

523
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,177
he's stronger without us around.

524
00:37:13,236 --> 00:37:14,056
Dad...

525
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:17,095
no.

526
00:37:19,325 --> 00:37:20,825
After everything,

527
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,234
after all the time we spent looking for you,

528
00:37:23,269 --> 00:37:24,574
please.

529
00:37:25,663 --> 00:37:28,983
- I've got to be a part of this fight.
- Sammy, this fight is just starting,

530
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:31,552
and we are all gonna have a part to play.

531
00:37:31,587 --> 00:37:34,012
For now, you've got to trust me, son.

532
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:38,920
Okay? You've got to let me go.

533
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:24,170
Be careful, boys.

534
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,920
Come on.
