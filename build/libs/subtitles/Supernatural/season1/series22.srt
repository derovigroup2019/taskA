1
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:09,049
Look, our whole lives we've been
searching for this demon.

2
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,600
We finally know where
this demon's gonna be...

3
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,436
...and now we know how to kill him.

4
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,646
This ends now. I'm ending it.

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,148
I don't care what it takes.

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,276
-A vision.
-Visions or no visions, the fact is...

7
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,777
...the demon is coming tonight.

8
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,280
And this family's gonna go through
the same hell we went through.

9
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,948
We know you have the gun, John.

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,451
-You just declared war.
-l'll bring you the Colt.

11
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,661
The demon is coming.
That gun is all we got.

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,955
Hand Meg a fake gun,
hope she doesn't notice?

13
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,915
I've been waiting
a long time for this fight.

14
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,334
Nobody's dying tonight.
Not us, not that family.

15
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,171
-Why don't you hand over the gun?
-Maybe l'll just shoot you.

16
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,298
There's more where l came from.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,508
It's coming.

18
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,430
I can't believe you just shot me!

19
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,931
It's a fake.

20
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,147
-Sam, no.
-Let me go. It's still in there.

21
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,648
It's suicide.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,150
-l don't care.
-l do.

23
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,490
That thing killed Jess.
That thing killed Mom.

24
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,159
They're gone.
And they're never coming back.

25
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,702
Don't you say that.

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,788
Not after all this.

27
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,801
You boys really screwed up this time.

28
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,848
Where is he?

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,644
You're never gonna see
your father again.

30
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,817
-They've got Dad.
-Meg?

31
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,946
-What'd she say?
-l just told you, Sammy.

32
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,326
Okay.

33
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,503
-What are you doing, Dean?
-We gotta go.

34
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,173
-Why?
-The demon knows we're in Salvation.

35
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,758
It knows we've got the Colt.

36
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,595
-lt's got Dad. lt's coming for us.
-Good. We've got three bullets left.

37
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,182
Listen, we're not ready. We don't know
how many of them are out there.

38
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,685
Now, we're no good to anybody dead.

39
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,396
We're leaving. Now.

40
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,033
-l'm telling you, we could've taken them.
-What we need is a plan.

41
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,536
They're probably keeping Dad alive.
Just gotta...

42
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,914
...figure out where.
They'll wanna trade him for the gun.

43
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,917
-What?
-Dean, if that were true...

44
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,587
...why didn't Meg mention a trade?

45
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,757
-Dad, he might be--
-Don't.

46
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,260
Look, l don't wanna believe it
any more than you...

47
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,388
...but if he is, all the more reason
to kill this damn thing.

48
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,807
We still have the Colt.
We can finish the job.

49
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,767
Screw the job, Sam.

50
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,271
I'm just trying to do what he'd want.
He would want us to keep going.

51
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,273
Quit talking about him like he's dead.

52
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,984
Listen to me, everything stops
until we get him back.

53
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,069
Do you understand me? Everything.

54
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,576
-- So how do we find him?
- We go to Lincoln.

55
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,828
Start at the warehouse
where he was taken.

56
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,123
Come on. You really think
these demons are gonna leave a trail?

57
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,459
You're right.

58
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,961
We need help.

59
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,365
Here you go.

60
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,828
-What is this, holy water?
-That one is. This is whiskey.

61
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,129
Bobby, thanks. Thanks for everything.

62
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:20,467
-l wasn't sure if we should come.
-Nonsense. Your daddy needs help.

63
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,137
Yeah, but last time we saw you,
I mean, you did threaten to blast him.

64
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,390
You cocked the shotgun
and everything.

65
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,850
Yeah, well, what can I say?

66
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:33,146
-John just has that effect on people.
-Yeah, I guess he does.

67
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:37,693
None of that matters now. All that
matters is that you get him back.

68
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,070
Bobby, this book....

69
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,865
-l've never seen anything like it.
-Key of Solomon?

70
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,576
It's the real deal, all right.

71
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,538
And these-- These protective circles,
they really work?

72
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:55,585
Hell, yeah. You get a demon in one,
they're trapped. Powerless.

73
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,046
It's like a satanic roach motel.

74
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,757
Man knows his stuff.

75
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,552
I'll tell you something else too.

76
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,888
This is some serious crap
you boys stepped in.

77
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,557
Oh, yeah?

78
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,893
-How's that?
-Normal year, I hear of...

79
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,771
...say, three demonic possessions.

80
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,857
-Maybe four, tops.
-Yeah?

81
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,235
This year, I heard of 27 so far.

82
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,862
You get what l'm saying?

83
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,616
More and more demons
are walking among us.

84
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,535
-A lot more.
-Do you know why?

85
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,913
No, but I know it's something big.

86
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,915
Storm's coming.

87
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,085
And you boys and your daddy...

88
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,546
...you are smack in the middle of it.

89
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,887
Rumsfeld.

90
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,722
What is it?

91
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,395
Something's wrong.

92
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,069
No more crap, okay?

93
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,789
I want the Colt, Sam.

94
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,583
The real Colt.

95
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,002
Right now.

96
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:23,298
-We don't have it on us. We buried it.
-Didn't I say, "No more crap"?

97
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,135
I swear, after everything l heard
about you Winchesters...

98
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,846
...l gotta tell you,
I'm a little underwhelmed.

99
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,100
First Johnny tries to
pawn off a fake gun...

100
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,104
...and then he leaves the real gun
with you two chuckleheads.

101
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,480
Lackluster, man.

102
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,986
I mean, did you really think
I wouldn't find you?

103
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,619
Actually, we were counting on it.

104
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,551
Gotcha.

105
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,530
You know, if you wanted to tie me up,
all you had to do was ask.

106
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,077
I salted the doors and windows.

107
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,289
If there are any demons out there,
they ain't getting in.

108
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:49,009
-Where's our father, Meg?
-You didn't ask very nice.

109
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,720
Where's our father, bitch?

110
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,098
Jeez, you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

111
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,811
-Oh, I forgot. You don't.
-Hey, you think this is a frigging game?

112
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,773
-Where is he? What did you do to him?
-He died screaming.

113
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,234
I killed him myself.

114
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,749
That's kind of a turn on,
you hitting a girl.

115
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,460
You're no girl.

116
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,962
Dean.

117
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,927
-You okay?
-She's lying. He's not dead.

118
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,596
Dean, you gotta be careful with her.
Don't hurt her.

119
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,098
-Why?
-Because she really is a girl, that's why.

120
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,101
-What are you talking about?
-She's possessed.

121
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,647
That's a human possessed
by a demon. Can't you tell?

122
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,277
You trying to tell me there's an innocent
girl trapped somewhere in there?

123
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,119
That's actually good news.

124
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,384
You gonna read me a story?

125
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,805
Something like that. Hit it, Sam.

126
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,481
An exorcism? Are you serious?

127
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,986
We're going for it, baby. Head spinning,
projectile vomiting, the whole nine yards.

128
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,664
I'm gonna kill you.

129
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,167
I'm gonna rip the bones
from your body.

130
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,504
No, you're gonna burn in hell.

131
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,339
Unless you tell us where our dad is.

132
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,345
Well, at least you'll get a nice tan.

133
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,577
He begged for his life
with tears in his eyes.

134
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,497
He begged to see his sons
one last time.

135
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,249
That's when I slit his throat.

136
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,093
For your sake, I hope you're lying.

137
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,387
Because if it's true, I swear to God...

138
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,224
...l will march into hell myself
and l will slaughter...

139
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:47,187
...each and every one of you
evil sons of bitches, so help me, God.

140
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,003
Where is he?

141
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,050
-You just won't take dead for an answer.
-Where is he?

142
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,760
-Dead.
-No, he's not!

143
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,637
He's not dead. He can't be!

144
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,894
What are you looking at?
Keep reading.

145
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,540
-He will be!
-Wait! What?

146
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,126
He's not dead.

147
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,420
But he will be
after what we do to him.

148
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,800
-How do we know you're telling the truth?
-You don't.

149
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,345
-Sam--!
-A building, okay?

150
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,807
-A building in Jefferson City.
-Missouri? Where, where? An address.

151
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,560
-l don't know.
-And the demon. Where is it?

152
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,311
I don't know. l swear.

153
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,983
That's everything. That's all I know.

154
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,656
-Finish it.
-What?

155
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,825
-l told you the truth!
-l don't care.

156
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,579
-You son of a bitch, you promised.
-l lied!

157
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,165
Sam.

158
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,668
Sam!

159
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,172
Read.

160
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,467
Maybe we can still use her.
Find out where the demon is.

161
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,051
-She doesn't know.
-She lied!

162
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:46,181
Sam, there's an innocent girl trapped
in there and we've gotta help her.

163
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,683
-You're gonna kill her.
-What?

164
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,686
You said she fell from a building.

165
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,316
That girl's body is broken.

166
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,903
The only thing keeping her alive
is that demon inside.

167
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,156
You exorcise it, the girl is gonna die.

168
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,200
We are not gonna leave her like that.

169
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,703
-She is a human being.
-We're gonna put her out of her misery.

170
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,831
Sam, finish it.

171
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,718
Finish it.

172
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,699
She's still alive. Call 911.
Get some water and blankets.

173
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:36,249
-Thank you.
-Just take it easy, all right?

174
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,504
Come on, let's-- Let's get her down.

175
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,924
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

176
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,636
I gotcha. Gotcha.

177
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,597
It's okay. It's okay.

178
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,935
-A year.
-What?

179
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,938
-lt's been a year.
-Just take it easy.

180
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,652
I've been awake for some of it.

181
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,366
I couldn't move my own body.

182
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,663
And things looked-- It--

183
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,666
It's a nightmare.

184
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,628
-Was it telling the truth about our dad?
-Dean.

185
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,505
-We need to know.
-Yes.

186
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,763
But it wants you to know.

187
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,267
They want you to come for him.

188
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,270
If Dad's still alive,
none of that matters.

189
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,700
Where is the demon we're looking for?

190
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,828
Not there.

191
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,333
Other ones. Awful ones.

192
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,045
Where are they keeping our dad?

193
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,007
By the riv-- River.

194
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:16,391
-Sunrise.
-Sunrise? What does that mean?

195
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,812
What does that mean?

196
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,268
You better hurry up and beat it
before the paramedics get here.

197
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,978
What are you gonna tell them?

198
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,689
You think you guys invented
lying to the cops?

199
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,025
I'll figure something out.

200
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,485
Here, take this.

201
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,488
-You might need it.
-Thanks.

202
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,909
Thanks for everything.

203
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,871
-Be careful, all right?
-You just go find your dad.

204
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,124
And when you do,
you bring him around, would you?

205
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,210
I won't even try to shoot him
this time.

206
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,037
You've been quiet.

207
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,957
Just getting ready.

208
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,838
He's gonna be fine, Dean.

209
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,069
Dude, what are you drawing
on my car?

210
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,238
It's called a devil's trap.

211
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,283
-Demons can't get through it or inside it.
-So?

212
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,995
Basically turns the trunk
into a lockbox.

213
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,374
So?

214
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,670
So we have a place to hide the Colt
while we go get Dad.

215
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,256
-We're bringing the Colt with us.
-Can't, Dean.

216
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,218
We only got three bullets left.
We can't just use them on any demon.

217
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:01,180
-We gotta use them on the demon.
-No, we have to save Dad, Sam.

218
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,141
Okay, we need
all the help we can get.

219
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,519
Do you know how pissed Dad would be
if we used all the bullets?

220
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,313
-He wouldn't want us to bring the gun.
-l don't care.

221
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,733
I don't care what Dad wants. Since
when do you care what Dad wants?

222
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,820
We wanna kill this demon.
You used to want that too.

223
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,406
Hell, you're the one
who came and got me at school.

224
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,243
You're the one who dragged me back
into this. I'm just trying to finish it.

225
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,042
You and Dad are more alike
than l thought, you know that?

226
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,420
You both can't wait
to sacrifice yourself.

227
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,089
But you know what?
I'm gonna be the one to bury you.

228
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,679
It's selfish, you know that?

229
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,348
You don't care about anything
but revenge.

230
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,185
That's not true, Dean.
I want Dad back.

231
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:51,689
They are expecting us to bring this gun.
They get the gun, they will kill us all.

232
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,734
That Colt is our only leverage
and you know it, Dean.

233
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,486
We cannot bring that gun.

234
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,989
-We can't.
-Fine.

235
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,617
-l'm serious, Dean.
-l said fine, Sam.

236
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,899
Hey, hey.

237
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,694
I think I know what
Meg meant by "sunrise."

238
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,792
Son of a bitch. lt's pretty smart.

239
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,879
If these demons can possess people,
they can possess anybody inside.

240
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,632
Yeah, and make anybody attack us.

241
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,803
Yeah, so we can't kill them.
A building full of human shields.

242
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,556
They probably know what we look like
too. And they could look like anybody.

243
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,184
-Man, this sucks out loud.
-Yeah, tell me about it.

244
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,938
All right, so how the hell
are we gonna get in?

245
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,902
Pull the fire alarm.
Get out all the civilians.

246
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,989
Okay, but then the city responds
in what, seven minutes?

247
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,532
Seven minutes exactly.

248
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,811
Hey, what--? What's happening?
Is it a fire?

249
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,314
We're figuring that out now, sir.
Just stay back.

250
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,940
Well, l got a Yorkie upstairs.

251
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,235
-He pees when he's nervous.
-Sir, you have to stay back.

252
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,051
l always wanted
to be a fireman when l grew up.

253
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,677
You never told me that.

254
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,163
This is the fire department.
We need you to evacuate.

255
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,986
Hurry up. Hurry up.

256
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,261
Come on. Dad.

257
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,564
Dad.

258
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,616
He's still breathing.

259
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,285
Dad, wake up. Dad!

260
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,999
-Wait. Wait.
-What?

261
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,835
He could be possessed,
for all we know.

262
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,837
-Are you nuts?
-Dean.

263
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,672
We gotta be sure.

264
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,114
Sam?

265
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,494
Why are you splashing water on me?

266
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:45,626
-Dad, you okay?
-They've been drugging me.

267
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,255
-Where's the Colt?
-Don't worry, Dad.

268
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,048
It's safe.

269
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,178
Good boys. Good boys.

270
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,450
Hey, buddy. You can't go in.

271
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,133
Go. Go. Come on. Back, back. Go.

272
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,021
Sam, let's go.

273
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,827
Sam. Sam, come on.

274
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,704
Come on.

275
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,133
Come on. Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

276
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,302
-How is he?
-He just needed a little rest, that's all.

277
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,513
How are you?

278
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,559
I'll survive.

279
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,982
Hey, you don't think we were
followed here, do you?

280
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,067
I don't know. l don't think so.

281
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,571
I mean, we couldn't have found
a more out-of-the-way place to hole up.

282
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,322
Yeah.

283
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:12,833
Hey, Dean, you--

284
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,297
You saved my life back there.

285
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,884
So l guess you're glad
I brought the gun, huh?

286
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,096
Man, l'm trying to thank you here.

287
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,517
You're welcome.

288
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,907
-- Hey, Sam.
- Yeah?

289
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,326
You know that guy l shot?

290
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,454
There was a person in there.

291
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,836
You didn't have a choice, Dean.

292
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,131
Yeah, l know.
That's not what bothers me.

293
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,718
Then what does?

294
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,725
Killing that guy, killing Meg...

295
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,730
...l didn't hesitate.
I didn't even flinch.

296
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:24,154
I mean, for you or Dad, the things
I'm willing to do or kill, it's just....

297
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,409
It scares me sometimes.

298
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:41,380
It shouldn't. You did good.

299
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,925
You're not mad?

300
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,679
-For what?
-Using a bullet.

301
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,934
Mad? I'm proud of you.

302
00:30:55,687 --> 00:31:00,107
You know, Sam and l,
we can get pretty obsessed.

303
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,610
But you-- You--

304
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,447
You watch out for this family.
You always have.

305
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,123
Thanks.

306
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,012
-lt found us. lt's here.
-The demon.

307
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,973
Sam, lines of salt.
In front of every window, every door.

308
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,808
-l already did it.
-Well, check it.

309
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,810
-Okay?
-Okay.

310
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,812
-Dean, you got the gun?
-Yeah.

311
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,315
-Give it to me.
-Sam tried to shoot the demon...

312
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,692
-...and it vanished.
-This is me. I won't miss.

313
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,819
Now, the gun. Hurry.

314
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,076
Son, please.

315
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,253
Give me the gun. What are you doing?

316
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,047
-He'd be furious.
-What?

317
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,548
That I wasted a bullet.

318
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,552
He wouldn't be proud of me.
He'd tear me a new one.

319
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,186
You're not my dad.

320
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,945
-Dean, it's me.
-l know my dad better than anyone.

321
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,030
-You ain't him.
-What's gotten into you?

322
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,367
I could ask you the same thing.
Stay back.

323
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,286
Dean. What the hell's going on?

324
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,205
Your brother's lost his mind.

325
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,207
-He's not Dad.
-What?

326
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,752
I think he's possessed. He's been
possessed since we rescued him.

327
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,712
-Don't listen.
-Dean, how do you know?

328
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:49,091
-He's-- He's different.
-You know, we don't have time for this.

329
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,678
Sam, you wanna kill this demon,
you gotta trust me.

330
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,477
Sam.

331
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:12,239
No.

332
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,458
Fine.

333
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,712
You're both so sure.

334
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,256
Go ahead.

335
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,509
Kill me.

336
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,109
I thought so.

337
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:07,044
What a pain in the ass
this thing's been.

338
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,298
It's you, isn't it?

339
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,803
-We've been looking for you a long time.
-Well, you found me.

340
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,638
But the holy water....

341
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,767
You think something like that
works on something like me?

342
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,398
I'm gonna kill you.

343
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,402
Oh, that would be a neat trick.

344
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:36,198
In fact, here.

345
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,035
Make the gun float to you there,
psychic boy.

346
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,587
You know, this is fun.

347
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,550
I could've killed you
a hundred times today, but this--

348
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,887
This is worth the wait.

349
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:07,896
Your dad, he's in here with me.

350
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,315
Trapped inside his own meat suit.

351
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,692
He says hi, by the way.

352
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,861
He's gonna tear you apart.

353
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,742
-He's gonna taste the iron in your blood.
-Let him go.

354
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,036
-Or l swear to God--
-What?

355
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,872
What are you and God gonna do?

356
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,378
You see, as far as I'm concerned,
this is justice.

357
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,553
You know that little exorcism
of yours?

358
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,973
That was my daughter.

359
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,226
-Who, Meg?
-The one in the alley...

360
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,355
...that was my boy.

361
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,983
You understand?

362
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,943
-You gotta be kidding me.
-What?

363
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,237
You're the only one
that can have a family?

364
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,740
You destroyed my children.

365
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,577
How would you feel if
I killed your family?

366
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,752
Oh, that's right.

367
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,504
I forgot, l did.

368
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,761
Still, two wrongs don't make a right.

369
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,141
-You son of a bitch.
-l wanna know why.

370
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,478
-Why did you do it?
-You mean, why did I kill Mommy...

371
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,647
-...and pretty little Jess?
-Yeah.

372
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:39,154
You know, I never told you this, but
Sam was gonna ask her to marry him.

373
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,200
Been shopping for rings
and everything.

374
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,494
You wanna know why?

375
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,164
-They got in the way.
-ln the way of what?

376
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,666
My plans for you, Sammy.

377
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,921
You and all of the children like you.

378
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,467
Listen, you mind just
getting this over with, huh?

379
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,678
-l really can't stand the monologuing.
-Funny.

380
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,056
But that's all part of
your m.o., isn't it?

381
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,143
Masks all that nasty pain.
Masks the truth.

382
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,646
Oh, yeah? What's that?

383
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:16,524
You know, you fight and you fight
for this family, but the truth is...

384
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,860
...they don't need you.

385
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,197
Not like you need them.

386
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:28,245
Sam, he's clearly John's favorite.

387
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:34,167
Even when they fight, it's more concern
than he's ever shown you.

388
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,215
I'll bet you're real proud
of your kids too, huh?

389
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,676
Oh, wait, l forgot.

390
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,678
I wasted them.

391
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,736
Dean.

392
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,489
No!

393
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,371
Dad. Dad.

394
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,709
-Dad.
-Dad.

395
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,211
Don't you let it kill me.

396
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,256
Dean!

397
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,812
Dad, please.

398
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,406
Dean!

399
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,076
-No! Don't!
-Stop.

400
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,913
Stop it.

401
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:05,300
You kill me, you kill Daddy.

402
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,968
I know.

403
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,857
Dean. Dean. Hey.

404
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,026
Oh, God. You lost a lot of blood.

405
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,861
-Where's Dad?
-He's right here.

406
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:28,156
-He's right here, Dean.
-Go check on him.

407
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,658
-Dean.
-Go check on him.

408
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:43,671
Dad.

409
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:47,300
Sammy! lt's still alive.

410
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,386
It's inside me. I can feel it.

411
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,805
Just shoot me. You shoot me.

412
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,225
You shoot me in the heart, son.

413
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,144
-Do it now!
-Sam, don't you do it. Don't you do it.

414
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:01,481
You gotta hurry.
I can't hold onto it much longer.

415
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,651
Just shoot me, son. Shoot me!

416
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,988
Son, l'm begging you.
We can end this, here and now.

417
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,491
Sammy!

418
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,328
-Sam, no.
-You do this!

419
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,164
Sammy!

420
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,501
Sam.

421
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:08,089
Look, just hold on, all right?
The hospital's only 10 minutes away.

422
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,469
I'm surprised at you, Sammy.
Why didn't you kill it?

423
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,806
I thought we saw eye to eye on this.
Killing this demon comes first.

424
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,058
Before me, before everything.

425
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,521
No, sir.

426
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,523
Not before everything.

427
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,735
Look, we still got the Colt.

428
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,488
We still have the one bullet left.

429
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,200
We should start over, all right? l mean,
we already found the demon once--
