1
00:00:01,994 --> 00:00:03,427
sammy!

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,327
take your brother outside
as fast as you can!

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,427
go!

4
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:11,360
dad's on a hunting trip.

5
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:13,161
and he hasn't been home
in a few days.

6
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:18,293
this is dad's book.

7
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:20,161
i think he wants us to pick up
where he left off -

8
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:23,861
saving people, hunting things,
the family business.

9
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:26,927
i got to find dad. it's the only
think i can think about.

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,094
bethany:
now i lay me down to sleep.

11
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:36,293
i pray the lord my soul to keep.

12
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,027
thy angels watch me
through the night

13
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:41,794
and keep me safe
till morning light.

14
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:44,761
amen.

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,260
night, monkeypuss.

16
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:57,094
daddy?

17
00:00:57,128 --> 00:00:59,161
is mommy coming home?

18
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,027
no, honey.

19
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:08,128
she's spending the night at
the hospital with your sister.

20
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,460
hey.

21
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:11,627
you sleep tight now.

22
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,177
dean: yeah,
you probably missed something.

23
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,344
dude, i ran lexisnexis,
local police reports,

24
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:13,644
newspapers - i couldn't find
a single red flag.

25
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,744
are you sure you got
the coordinates right?

26
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:16,878
yeah, i double-checked.

27
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,210
it's fitchburg, wisconsin.

28
00:03:18,244 --> 00:03:20,210
dad wouldn't have sent us
coordinates

29
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:21,878
if it wasn't important,
sammy.

30
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,210
well, i'm telling you,
i looked,

31
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,244
and all i could find was a big,
steamy pile of nothing.

32
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:26,577
if dad's sending us
hunting for something,

33
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:27,644
i don't know what.

34
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:29,144
well, maybe he's gonna
meet us there.

35
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:32,344
yeah, 'cause he's been so easy
to find up to this point.

36
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,544
you're a real smartass,
you know that?

37
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:35,910
don't worry.

38
00:03:35,943 --> 00:03:38,310
i'm sure there's something
in fitchburg worth killing.

39
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,544
yeah?
what makes you so sure?

40
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:43,744
because i'm the oldest,
which means i'm always right.

41
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:46,477
no, it doesn't.
it totally does.

42
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,611
well, the waitress thinks

43
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,778
that the local freemasons are up
to something sneaky,

44
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,077
but other than that,

45
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,844
nobody's heard
about anything weird going on.

46
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,277
dean, you got the time?

47
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,577
10 after 4:00.

48
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:19,177
why?

49
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,344
what's wrong
with this picture?

50
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:30,677
school's out, isn't it?

51
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:32,310
yeah.

52
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:36,811
so where is everybody?

53
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:40,577
this place should be crawling
with kids right now.

54
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:56,977
it sure is quiet
out here.

55
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,778
yeah, it's a shame.

56
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,077
why is that?

57
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,577
you know, kids getting sick.
it's a terrible thing.

58
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:05,910
how many?

59
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:10,444
just five or six,
but serious, hospital serious.

60
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,177
a lot of parents are getting
pretty anxious.

61
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,744
they think it's catching.

62
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:30,844
dude, dude,
i am not using this i.d.

63
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:32,010
why not?

64
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:34,077
because it says
"bikini inspector" on it.

65
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,043
don't worry.
she won't look that close.

66
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:37,844
hell,
she won't even ask to see it.

67
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,210
it's all about confidence,
sammy.

68
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:42,144
hi.

69
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:45,110
i'm dr. jerry kaplan,
center for disease control.

70
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,244
can i see some i.d.?

71
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:52,411
yeah, of course.

72
00:05:54,744 --> 00:05:57,644
now, could you direct me
to the pediatrics ward?

73
00:05:57,677 --> 00:06:01,144
okay, just go down that hall,
turn left, up the stairs.

74
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:02,644
you'll see them.

75
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:04,477
right.
thank you.

76
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:06,611
see?
told you it would work.

77
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:09,411
follow me.
it's upstairs.

78
00:06:43,677 --> 00:06:45,010
sam: dean.

79
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:56,377
thanks for seeing us,
dr. hydaker.

80
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:58,277
oh, i'm glad you guys
are here.

81
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,677
i was just about to call
the cdc myself.

82
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,444
how did you find out
anyway?

83
00:07:02,477 --> 00:07:04,644
oh, some g.p. -
i forget his name -

84
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:07,677
he called atlanta and must have
beat you to the punch.

85
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:10,477
so you say you got six cases
so far?

86
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:12,878
yeah, in five weeks.

87
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,411
at first i thought
it was bacterial pneumonia,

88
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:16,544
not that newsworthy.

89
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:18,444
but now...

90
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:20,611
now, what?

91
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:22,977
the kids aren't responding
to antibiotics.

92
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,277
their white-cell counts
keep going down.

93
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,010
their immune systems
just aren't doing their job.

94
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:30,844
it's like their bodies
are wearing out.

95
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:32,444
betty:
excuse me, dr. hydaker.

96
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:34,244
you ever see anything
like this before?

97
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:35,411
never this severe.

98
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:37,943
the way it spreads -
that's a new one for me.

99
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:39,210
what do you mean?

100
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:40,744
it works its way
through families,

101
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:43,977
but only the children,
one sibling after another.

102
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,477
you mind if we interview
a few of the kids?

103
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,644
they're not conscious.

104
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,811
none of them?

105
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:53,644
no.

106
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:56,844
can we talk
to the parents?

107
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,210
if you think it'll help.

108
00:08:00,244 --> 00:08:03,811
yeah, yeah. who was your most
recent admission?

109
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:06,077
i should get back
to my girls.

110
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,344
we understand that,

111
00:08:07,377 --> 00:08:10,077
and we really appreciate
you talking to us.

112
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,144
now, you say
mary's the oldest?

113
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:13,377
13.

114
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,577
okay, and she came down
with it first, right?

115
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:16,677
and then...

116
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:18,844
bethany the next night.

117
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:20,744
within 24 hours?

118
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:23,511
i guess.

119
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,611
look, i already went through
all this with the doctor.

120
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:28,644
right. just a few more
questions, if you don't mind.

121
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:30,577
how do you think
they caught pneumonia?

122
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,778
were they out in the cold,
anything like that?

123
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,943
no, we think
it was an open window.

124
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:37,277
both times?

125
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,878
the first time,
i don't really remember,

126
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,444
but the second time
for sure,

127
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:45,477
and i know i closed it
before i put bethany to bed.

128
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:47,010
so you think
she opened it?

129
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:49,577
it's a second-story window,
no ledge.

130
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,177
no one else could have.

131
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,310
you know this might not be
anything supernatural.

132
00:08:58,344 --> 00:08:59,943
it might just be
pneumonia.

133
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:02,210
maybe. or maybe something
opened that window.

134
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:05,110
i don't know, man. look, dad
sent us down here for a reason.

135
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,444
i think we might be barking up
the right tree.

136
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:08,544
i'll tell you one thing.

137
00:09:08,577 --> 00:09:09,544
what?

138
00:09:09,577 --> 00:09:11,310
that guy
we just talked to -

139
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:14,110
i'm betting it'll be a while
before he goes home.

140
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:26,177
you got anything
over there?

141
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,878
no, nothing.

142
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,244
yeah, me neither.

143
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:43,344
hey, dean.

144
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:45,110
dean: yeah?

145
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:51,377
you were right.
it's not pneumonia.

146
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,310
it's rotted.

147
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:03,844
what the hell
leaves a handprint like that?

148
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:08,910
<i>man: cheetara.</i>

149
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,110
<i>woman:
i am sorry to wake you,</i>

150
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:11,544
<i>but jaga bids me
to bring you to him.</i>

151
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,577
john: all right.

152
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,177
you know the drill, dean.

153
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,511
if anyone calls,
you don't pick up.

154
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:21,878
if it's me, i'll ring once
and then call back.

155
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,244
you got that?

156
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:26,577
mm-hmm. don't answer the phone
unless it rings once first.

157
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:29,210
come on, dude. look alive.
this stuff's important.

158
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:30,344
i know, it's just,

159
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:32,811
we've done it
like a million times,

160
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:34,644
and you know
i'm not stupid.

161
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,811
i know you're not,
but it only takes one mistake.

162
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,210
you got that?

163
00:10:38,244 --> 00:10:41,611
<i>it's important that he join
jaga on the flight deck.</i>

164
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:44,210
all right,
if i'm not back sunday night...

165
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,611
call pastor jim.

166
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:50,511
lock the doors and windows,
close the shades,

167
00:10:50,544 --> 00:10:51,744
and most important -

168
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,310
watch out for sammy.

169
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:55,677
<i>responsible for lion-o's
welfare, snarf is.</i>

170
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:56,943
i know.

171
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:58,611
all right, if something
tries to bust in...

172
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:01,611
shoot first,
ask questions later.

173
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:03,744
that's my man.

174
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:09,010
<i>what's up, jaga?</i>

175
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,110
<i>come closer.</i>

dean: i know why dad
sent us here.

179
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:30,844
he's faced this thing
before.

180
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,778
he wants us
to finish the job.

181
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:00,884
so what the hell is
a shtriga?

182
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:02,817
it's kind of like a witch,
i think.

183
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:04,484
i don't know much
about them.

184
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:06,484
well,
i've never heard of it,

185
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,517
and it's not
in dad's journal.

186
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,183
dad hunted one
in fort douglas, wisconsin,

187
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:12,651
about 16, 17 years ago.

188
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:15,517
you were there.
you don't remember?
no.

189
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,018
i guess he caught wind that
the thing's in fitchburg now

190
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:19,517
and kicked us
the coordinates.

191
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,784
so wait, this...
shtriga.

192
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,751
right, you think it's the same
one dad hunted before?

193
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,283
yeah, maybe.

194
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:28,317
if dad went after it,
why is it still breathing air?

195
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,484
because it got away.

196
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:30,617
got away?

197
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:32,018
yeah, sammy, it happens.

198
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,217
not very often.

199
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,517
i don't know
what to tell you.

200
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,384
maybe dad didn't have
his wheaties that morning.

201
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,217
what else do you remember?

202
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,450
nothing.
i was a kid, all right?

203
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:51,851
king or two queens?

204
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:53,450
two queens.

205
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,118
yeah, i bet.

206
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,317
what'd you say?

207
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,283
nice car.

208
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:04,450
hi. checking in?

209
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,684
yeah.

210
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:09,250
uh, do me a favor.
go get your brother some dinner.

211
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:11,051
i'm helping a guest.

212
00:13:14,684 --> 00:13:16,851
two queens.

213
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:20,283
funny kid.

214
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:22,150
oh, yeah, he thinks so.

215
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:23,917
will that be cash
or credit?

216
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:25,550
do you take mastercard?
mm-hmm.

217
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:26,584
perfect.

218
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:27,684
there you go.

219
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:30,118
thank you.

220
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:48,584
when's dad gonna
get back?

221
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:50,118
tomorrow.

222
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,350
when?

223
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:52,384
i don't know.

224
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,250
he usually comes in late,
though.

225
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:56,018
now, eat your dinner.

226
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,283
i'm sick of "scabetti-os."

227
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:00,917
well, you're the one
who wanted them.

228
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:02,350
i want lucky charms.

229
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,951
there's no more
lucky charms.

230
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,250
i saw the box.

231
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:06,550
okay, maybe there is,

232
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:09,150
but there's only enough left
for one bowl,

233
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,751
and i haven't had any yet.

234
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:36,951
do you want the prize?

235
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:39,384
sir?

236
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:43,217
thanks.

237
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,517
well, you were right.

238
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,283
it wasn't very easy to find,
but you were right.

239
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:01,784
a shtriga is
a kind of witch.

240
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,051
they're albanian,

241
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:06,018
but legends about them
date back to ancient rome.

242
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:08,118
they feed off
of spiritus vitae.

243
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,784
spirit what?

244
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,084
vitae.
it's latin.

245
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,183
it translates
to "breath of life,"

246
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:16,517
kind of like your life force
or essence.

247
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,517
didn't the doctor say the kids'
bodies were wearing out?

248
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,484
it's a thought.

249
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:21,951
you know,
she takes your vitality,

250
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:24,118
maybe your immunity goes
to hell, pneumonia takes hold.

251
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,350
anyway, shtrigas can feed off
anyone, but they prefer -

252
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,118
children.

253
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,384
yeah.

254
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,484
probably because they have
stronger life force.

255
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:36,118
and get this -
shtrigas are invulnerable

256
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,717
to all weapons
devised by god and man.

257
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,951
no, that's not right.

258
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:44,450
she's vulnerable
when she feeds.

259
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:45,484
what?

260
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,450
if you catch her
when she's eating,

261
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:50,018
you can blast her with
consecrated wrought irons,

262
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:51,884
buckshots or rounds
i think.

263
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,550
how do you know that?

264
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:56,384
dad told me.
i remember.

265
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,817
oh.

266
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:02,884
so, uh, anything else
dad might have mentioned?

267
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,217
no, that's it.

268
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:09,384
what?

269
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,417
nothing.

270
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,250
okay, so, assuming we can kill
it when it eats,

271
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:19,084
we've still got to find
the thing first,

272
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:20,617
which ain't gonna be
a cakewalk.

273
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:23,051
shtrigas take on
a human disguise when
they're not hunting.

274
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,751
what kind of human disguise?

275
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,584
historically,
something innocuous.

276
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:29,417
it could be anything, but it's
usually a feeble old woman,

277
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,450
which may be how the witches-as-
old-crones legend got started.

278
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:33,550
hang on.

279
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:34,651
what?

280
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:37,884
check this out.

281
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,084
i marked down all the addresses
of the victims.

282
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:42,118
now, these are the houses
that have been hit so far,

283
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,350
and dead center -

284
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:45,584
the hospital.

285
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:48,751
when we were there,
i saw a patient, an old woman.

286
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:50,183
an old person, huh?

287
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,250
yeah.

288
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:52,350
in the hospital?

289
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:54,417
whew!
better call the coast guard.

290
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,751
well, listen, smartass,

291
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:58,417
she had an inverted cross
hanging on her wall.

292
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,651
betty:
good night, dr. hydaker.

293
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:17,217
see you tomorrow, betty.

294
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,350
try to get some sleep,
aaron.

295
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:26,784
come on.

296
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:30,384
who the hell are you?

297
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:31,684
who's there?

298
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:35,951
you trying to steal my stuff?

299
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,851
they're always
stealing around here.

300
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,684
no, ma'am, we're maintenance.
we're sorry.

301
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:42,317
we thought
you were sleeping.

302
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,051
ah, nonsense.

303
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:46,384
i was sleeping
with my peepers open.

304
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:52,817
and fix that crucifix,
would you?

305
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:56,317
i've asked four damn times
already.

306
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:57,007
"i was sleeping
with my peepers open."

307
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,341
i almost smoked that old gal,
i swear.

308
00:20:00,374 --> 00:20:01,774
it's not funny.

309
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,034
oh, man, you should have seen
your face, dean.

310
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,667
oh, yeah, laugh it on, man.
we're back to square one.

311
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:12,933
hang on.

312
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:24,200
hey, what's wrong?

313
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:27,134
my brother's sick.

314
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:28,301
the little guy?

315
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:30,200
pneumonia.

316
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:32,668
he's in the hospital.

317
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,800
it's my fault.

318
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,501
no, come on. how?

319
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:41,267
i should have made sure
the window was latched.

320
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:43,501
he wouldn't have
gotten pneumonia

321
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,167
if the window was latched.

322
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,167
listen to me.

323
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,634
i can promise you that
this is not your fault, okay?

324
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:58,100
it's my job
to look after him.

325
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:06,334
michael.

326
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,334
turn on the "no vacancy" sign
while i'm gone.

327
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:13,100
i've got denise covering
room service,

328
00:21:13,134 --> 00:21:14,200
so don't bother
with the rooms.

329
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:15,567
i'm going with you.
not now, michael.

330
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:16,701
but i got to see asher.

331
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,167
dean: hey, michael.

332
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,534
hey.

333
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:22,334
i know how you feel.
i'm a big brother, too.

334
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:25,067
but you got to go easy
on your mom right now, okay?

335
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,267
aw, damn it.

336
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:27,567
i got it.

337
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:30,334
thanks.
you're in
no condition to drive.

338
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:33,100
why don't you let me give you
a lift to the hospital?

339
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:34,434
no, no,
i couldn't possibly -

340
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:38,067
no, no trouble.
i insist.

341
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,000
be good.

342
00:21:52,668 --> 00:21:54,401
we're gonna
kill this thing.

343
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:56,501
i want it dead.
you hear me?

344
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,134
dean: hey.

345
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,567
hey, how's the kid?

346
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:20,034
he's not good.
where you at?

347
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:21,601
i'm at the library,

348
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:24,167
trying to find out as much
as i can about this shtriga.

349
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,833
yeah, what do you got?

350
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:27,067
well, bad news.

351
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,301
i started
with fort douglas

352
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:31,501
around the time
you said dad was there.

353
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:32,768
and?

354
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,933
same deal.

355
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:37,334
before that,
there was ogdenville.

356
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:41,234
before that, north haverbrook
and brockway.

357
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:44,967
every 15 to 20 years,
it hits a new town.

358
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,434
dean, this thing is just getting
started in fitchburg.

359
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,367
in all these other places,
it goes on for months,

360
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:54,501
dozens of kids, before
the shtriga finally moves on.

361
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:58,100
kids just languish in comas,
and then they die.

362
00:22:58,134 --> 00:23:00,301
how far back
does this thing go?

363
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:01,467
i don't know.

364
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:04,167
the earliest mention i could
find is this place

365
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,668
called black river falls
back in the 1890s.

366
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:09,501
talk about a horror show.

367
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:13,501
whoa.

368
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:14,534
sam?

369
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,000
hold on.

370
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:18,367
i'm looking at a photograph
right now

371
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:21,601
of a bunch of doctors
standing around a kid's bed.

372
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,501
one of the doctors
is hydaker.

373
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:26,067
and?

374
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,334
and this picture was taken
in 1893.

375
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,534
you sure?

376
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:33,134
yeah.

377
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,634
yeah, absolutely.

378
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:58,334
don't worry.
your son's in good hands.

379
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:01,601
i'm gonna take care
of him.

380
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:04,567
so what's the cdc come up
with so far?

381
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:07,100
we're still working
on a few theories.

382
00:24:07,134 --> 00:24:09,701
you'll know something as soon
as we do.

383
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:13,167
well, nothing's more important
to me than these kids.

384
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,167
hmm.

385
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,534
just let me know
if i can help.

386
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:19,768
i'll do that.

387
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,534
sam: we should have
thought of this before.

388
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:27,000
doctor's a perfect disguise.
you're trusted.

389
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,900
you can control
the whole thing.

390
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:32,933
huh.
that son of a bitch.

391
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,000
i'm surprised you didn't draw
on him right there.

392
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:38,000
yeah, well...

393
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:40,000
first of all,

394
00:24:40,034 --> 00:24:41,967
i'm not gonna open fire
in a freakin' pediatrics ward.

395
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,668
good call.

396
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:45,267
second, it wouldn't have done
any good

397
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:46,668
because the bastard's
bulletproof

398
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,267
unless he's chowing down
on something.

399
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:49,501
and third,
i wasn't packing,

400
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:51,067
which is probably
a really good thing

401
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,200
'cause i probably would have
just burned a clip in him

402
00:24:53,234 --> 00:24:54,634
off of principle alone.

403
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:57,234
you're getting wise
in your old age, dean.

404
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:58,467
you're damn right.

405
00:24:58,501 --> 00:25:01,100
'cause now i know
how we're gonna get it.

406
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:03,134
what do you mean?

407
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:05,000
the shtriga - it works
through siblings, right?

408
00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:06,134
right.

409
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:07,534
well, last night...

410
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:08,768
it went after asher.

411
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,701
tonight it's probably gonna come
after michael.

412
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:11,867
then we got to get him
out of here.

413
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,167
no. no, that would blow
the whole deal.

414
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,668
what?
yeah.

415
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:18,100
then you want to use
the kid as bait?

416
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,933
are you nuts? no. forget it.
that's out of the question.

417
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:24,467
sam, it's the only way -
if this thing disappears,

418
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:26,800
it could be years
before we get another chance.

419
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,567
michael's a kid,
and i'm not gonna dangle him

420
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:30,334
in front of that thing
like a worm on a hook.

421
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:32,334
dad did not send me here
to walk away.

422
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:34,534
<i>send you here?
he didn't send you here.</i>

423
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,768
<i>he sent us here.
this isn't about you, sam.</i>

424
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,601
i'm the one that screwed up.
it's my fault.

425
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:40,701
there's no telling
how many kids have gotten hurt

426
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:41,833
because of me.

427
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:45,434
what are you saying, dean?
how is it your fault?

428
00:25:51,234 --> 00:25:52,668
dean.

429
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:55,933
you've been hiding something
from the get-go.

430
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:58,601
since when does dad bail
on a hunt?

431
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:01,668
since when does
he let something get away?

432
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:06,900
now, talk to me, man.
tell me what's going on.

433
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:19,234
fort douglas, wisconsin.

434
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:22,267
it was the third night
in this crap room,

435
00:26:22,301 --> 00:26:24,900
and i was climbing the walls,
man.

436
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,734
i needed to get some air.

437
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:28,367
<i>...if ever i saw one.</i>

438
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:30,000
<i>command performance.</i>

439
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:58,267
hey, kid.

440
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:01,434
we're closing up.

441
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,134
get out of the way!

442
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:20,701
sammy. sammy.
sammy.

443
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:22,000
you okay?

444
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,768
sam:
dad, what's going on?

445
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,634
are you all right?

446
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:33,634
what happened?

447
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:35,701
i- i just went out.

448
00:28:35,734 --> 00:28:37,401
what?

449
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:40,067
j- just for a second.
i'm sorry.

450
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,467
i told you not to leave
this room.

451
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:45,467
i told you not to let him
out of your sight.

452
00:28:57,668 --> 00:29:01,933
dad just grabbed us and booked,

453
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:07,501
dropped us off at pastor jim's
about three hours away.

454
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:10,301
by the time he got back
to fort douglas,

455
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:12,200
the shtriga had disappeared.

456
00:29:12,234 --> 00:29:14,467
it was just gone.

457
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:21,668
it never resurfaced until now.

458
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:24,668
dad never spoke about it again.

459
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:27,701
i didn't ask.

460
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:30,234
but he, uh...

461
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:37,501
he looked at me different,
you know, which was worse.

462
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:39,000
not that i blame him.

463
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:41,900
he gave me an order,
and i didn't listen,

464
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:44,067
and i almost
got you killed.

465
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,501
you were just a kid.

466
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:49,501
don't.

467
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:54,034
dad knew this was
unfinished business for me.

468
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:57,267
he sent me here
to finish it.

469
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:03,134
but using michael -
i don't know, dean.

470
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:06,367
i mean, how about one of us
hides under the cover?

471
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,267
you know,
we'll be the bait.

472
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:12,267
no, that won't work.

473
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:15,301
it's got to get close enough
to feed. it'll see us.

474
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:20,367
believe me, i don't like it,
but it's got to be the kid.

475
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:27,933
michael: you're crazy!

476
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:30,567
just go away
or i'm calling the cops.

477
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:32,634
hang on a second.
just listen to me.

478
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:35,134
you have to believe me,
okay?

479
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,734
this thing came through
the window

480
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:37,933
and attacked your brother.

481
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:41,567
i've seen it.

482
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:43,100
i know what it looks like

483
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:45,601
'cause it attacked
my brother once, too.

484
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,768
this thing -

485
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,434
is it, like...

486
00:30:57,467 --> 00:31:02,000
it has this long,
black robe?

487
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:04,267
you saw it last night,
didn't you?

488
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:08,267
i thought i was having
a nightmare.

489
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:14,301
i'd give anything
not to tell you this,

490
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:16,401
but sometimes nightmares
are real.

491
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:19,534
<i>so why are you
telling me?</i>

492
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,334
because we need your help.

493
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:22,734
my help?

494
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:27,501
we can kill it, me and him.
it's what we do.

495
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:29,567
but we can't do it
without you.

496
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:32,800
what? no.

497
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,534
michael, listen to me.

498
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,301
this thing hurt asher,

499
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:39,534
and it's gonna keep hurting kids
unless we stop it.

500
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,000
do you understand me?

501
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,634
well, that went crappy.
now what?

502
00:31:46,668 --> 00:31:47,833
what did you expect?

503
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:50,434
you can't ask an adult
to do something like that,

504
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:52,167
much less a kid.

505
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:03,234
if you kill it,
will asher get better?

506
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:11,567
honestly, we don't know.

507
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,501
you said
you're a big brother.

508
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:19,734
yeah.

509
00:32:19,768 --> 00:32:21,601
you'd take care
of your little brother?

510
00:32:21,634 --> 00:32:25,467
you'd do anything
for him?

511
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:27,734
yeah, i would.

512
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:33,434
me too.

513
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:34,833
i'll help.

514
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,604
this camera has night vision
on it,

515
00:32:57,638 --> 00:32:59,638
so we'll be able to see you
as clear as day.

516
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,870
are we good?

517
00:33:00,904 --> 00:33:02,037
hair to the right.

518
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,970
there, there.

519
00:33:04,004 --> 00:33:07,271
michael:
what do i do?

520
00:33:07,304 --> 00:33:10,904
just stay under
the covers.

521
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:14,437
and if it shows up?

522
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:16,337
well, we'll be right
in the next room.

523
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,937
we're gonna come in with guns,
so as soon as we do,

524
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,304
you roll off this bed
and you crawl under it.

525
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:25,104
what if you shoot me?

526
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:27,703
we won't shoot you.
we're good shots.

527
00:33:29,337 --> 00:33:32,571
we're not gonna fire
until you're clear, okay?

528
00:33:32,604 --> 00:33:35,070
have you heard
a gunshot before?

529
00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:36,737
like in the movies?

530
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,337
it's gonna be a lot louder

565
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,777
really?

566
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,777
yeah, really.
no one can explain it.

567
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,644
it's, uh, it's a miracle.

568
00:38:53,677 --> 00:38:55,810
they're gonna keep him
in overnight for observation,

569
00:38:55,844 --> 00:38:57,311
but after that,
he's coming home.

570
00:38:57,344 --> 00:38:58,378
that's great.

571
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,911
how are all
the other kids doing?

572
00:39:00,944 --> 00:39:02,144
good, real good.

573
00:39:02,177 --> 00:39:04,244
a bunch of them should be
checking out in a few days.

574
00:39:04,278 --> 00:39:06,777
dr. travis says the ward's
gonna be like a ghost town.

575
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,044
dr. travis?
what about dr. hydaker?

576
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:11,144
oh, he wasn't in today.

577
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:12,877
he must have been sick
or something.

578
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:15,443
yeah, yeah, must have.

579
00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:19,610
so did anything happen
while i was gone?

580
00:39:19,644 --> 00:39:21,610
no, same old stuff.

581
00:39:21,644 --> 00:39:23,410
okay.
you can go see ash.

582
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:24,944
now?
only if you want to.

583
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:30,810
i better get going

584
00:39:30,844 --> 00:39:33,077
before he hot-wires the car
and drives himself.

585
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,311
it's too bad.

586
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:45,944
no, they'll be fine.

587
00:39:45,977 --> 00:39:47,344
that's not what i meant.

588
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:48,710
i meant michael.

589
00:39:48,744 --> 00:39:51,577
he'll always know there are
things out there in the dark.

590
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,677
he'll never be the same,
you know?

591
00:39:57,877 --> 00:40:01,543
sometimes i wish that...

592
00:40:02,744 --> 00:40:04,844
what?

593
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:07,911
i wish i could have
that kind of innocence.

594
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,244
if it means anything,
sometimes i wish you could, too.

595
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:32,911
* i was looking back
on my life *

596
00:40:32,944 --> 00:40:38,977
* and all the things
i've done to me *

597
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:45,311
* i'm still looking
for the answers *

598
00:40:45,344 --> 00:40:51,344
* i'm still searching
for the key *

599
00:40:51,378 --> 00:40:53,710
* the road to nowhere...
