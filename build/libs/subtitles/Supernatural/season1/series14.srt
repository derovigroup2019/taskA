1
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,900
Somebody help me!
Somebody...!

2
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,230
Somebody help...!

3
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,520
Dean.

4
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,950
Dean.

5
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,980
What are you doing, man?
It's in the middle of the night.

6
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,890
We have to go.

7
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,060
- What's happening?
- We have to go.

8
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,540
Right now.

9
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,900
Mcreedy.

10
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,210
Detective Mcreedy.
Badge number 158.

11
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,530
I've got a signal
four eighty on progress.

12
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,890
I need a registered owner
of a Two door Sedan.

13
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,230
Michigan license plate
Mary, Frank, 6-0-3-7.

14
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,650
Yeah, okay. Just hurry.

15
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,000
Sammy, relax.

16
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,160
- I'm sure, its just a nightmare.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

17
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,280
I mean it. You know, a normal everyday
naked class nightmare.

18
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,540
This license plate,
it won't check out. You'll see.

19
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,380
It felt different Dean. Real.

20
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,740
Like we dreamt about our
old house and Jessica.

21
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,510
Oh, yeah. That makes sense. Dreaming
about our house, your girlfriend.

22
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,300
This guy in your dream,
you ever seen him before?

23
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,770
No... / No, exactly.

24
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,350
Why would you have premonitions
about some random dude in Michigan?

25
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,660
- I don't know.
- Yeah, me neither.

26
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,030
Yes, I'm here.

27
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,040
Jim Miller, Saginaw Michigan.

28
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,510
You have the street address?

29
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,550
Got it. Thanks.

30
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,090
It checks out.

31
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,660
How far are we?

32
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,880
- From Saginaw?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,530
A couple of hours.

34
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,990
Drive faster.

35
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,220
What happened?

36
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,130
Suicide.

37
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,370
I can't believe it.

38
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,800
Did you know him?

39
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,460
Saw him everyday at Saint Augustine.

40
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,080
Always seems...
seemed so normal.

41
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,210
I guess you never know
what's going behind closed doors.

42
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,800
- I guess not.
- How did uh...

43
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,320
What are they saying happened?

44
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,320
I heard they found him in the garage

45
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,830
locked inside his car
with the engine running.

46
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,700
Do you know about
what time they found him?

47
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,310
It just happened an hour or two ago.

48
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,210
His poor family.

49
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,870
I can't even imagine
what they're going through.

50
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,980
Sam, we got here as fast as we could.

51
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,020
Not fast enough.

52
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,050
Which doesn't make any sense, man.

53
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,020
Why would I even have these premonitions

54
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,370
unless there was a chance that
I can stop them from happening.

55
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't know.

56
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,570
So, what do you think killed him?

57
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,410
Maybe the guy killed himself.

58
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,320
Maybe there's nothing
supernatural going on at all.

59
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,930
I'm telling you.
I watched it happen.

60
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,500
He was murdered by something Dean.

61
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,480
It trapped him in the garage.

62
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,220
Like what? A spirit?
A poltergeist? What?

63
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,650
I don't know what it was.

64
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,790
I don't know why
I'm having these dreams.

65
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,900
I don't know what the hell
is happening Dean.

66
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,690
What?

67
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,210
Nothing, man.
I'm just worried about you.

68
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Well, don't look at me like that.

69
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,220
I'm not looking at you like anything.

70
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,620
But I got to say.
You look like crap.

71
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,450
- Nice, thanks.
- You welcome.

72
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,310
Come on, let's just
pick this up in the morning.

73
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,990
Check out the house,
we'll talk to the family.

74
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,070
Dean, you saw them.
They're devastated.

75
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,710
They're not gonna want to talk to us.

76
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,150
Yeah, you're right.

77
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,350
But I think I know who they'll talk to.

78
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,200
Who?

79
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,740
This has got to be
a whole new loaf for us.

80
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,670
Good afternoon.

81
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,190
I'm Father Simmons.
This is Father Freely.

82
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,680
We're new junior priests
at Saint Augustine.

83
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,450
May we come in?

84
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,920
Thanks.

85
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,410
We're very sorry for your loss.

86
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,830
In difficult times like these when the
Lord's guidance is most needed. / Look...

87
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,280
You want to pitch your whole
Lord has a plan thing fine.

88
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,640
Don't pitch it to me.
My brother's dead.

89
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,130
Roger, please.

90
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,420
Excuse me.

91
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,920
I'm sorry about my brother in law.

92
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,960
He's just so upset about Jim's death.

93
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,580
Would you like some coffee?

94
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,220
That'll be great.

95
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,040
It was wonderful of you to stop by.

96
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,640
The support of the church
means so much right now.

97
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,800
Of course.

98
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,930
After all, we all are god's children.

99
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,200
What?

100
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,150
Just tone it down a little bit, Father.

101
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,520
So, Ms. Miller.

102
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,430
Did your husband have
a history of depression?

103
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,180
Nothing like that.

104
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,130
We... had our ups and downs
like everyone.

105
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,480
But we were happy.

106
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,500
I just don't understand

107
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,870
how Jim could do something like that.

108
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,330
I'm so sorry you had to
find him like that.

109
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,630
Actually...

110
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,770
Our son, Max.

111
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,120
He was the one who found him.

112
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,820
Do you mind if maybe...
I go talk to him?

113
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,970
No.

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,130
Oh, thank you Father.

115
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,910
Max?

116
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,770
Hey, I'm Sam.

117
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,190
Ms. Miller, you have a lovely home.

118
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,590
How long have you lived here?

119
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,520
We moved in about five years ago.

120
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,040
You know, the only problem
with these old houses

121
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,140
I bet you have
all kinds of headaches.

122
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,060
Like what?

123
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,920
Well...

124
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,380
Weird leaks.

125
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,470
Electrical shortages.

126
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,280
Odd sort of noises at night.
That kind of things.

127
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,270
No, nothing like that.

128
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,610
It's been perfect.

129
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,610
May I use your restroom?

130
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,160
Oh, sure.
It's just up the stairs.

131
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,620
Okay.

132
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,080
So, what was your dad like?

133
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,300
Just a normal dad.

134
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,690
Yeah.

135
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,830
You live at home now?

136
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,380
Yeah.

137
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,070
I'm trying to save up
for school but it's hard.

138
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,420
So, when you found your dad?

139
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,600
I woke up.

140
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,140
I heard the engine running.

141
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,830
I don't know why he did it.

142
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,060
I know its ruff.

143
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,050
Losing a parent.

144
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,740
Especially when you don't have
all the answers.

145
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,210
Anything?

146
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,770
Zip.

147
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,240
Escanaba Motel
No Vacancy

148
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,200
- So, what do you have?
- Well, nothing.

149
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,950
Nothing bad has happened to
the Miller house since it was built.

150
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,980
- What about the land?
- No graveyard, battlefields,

151
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,860
tribal lands or any other kind
of atrocity on or near the property.

152
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,510
Hey, man. I told you.
I searched the house up and down.

153
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,190
There were no cold spots,
no soul person, nada.

154
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,570
And the family said
everything was normal.

155
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,450
Well, if there was a demon or poltergeist.

156
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,210
You don't think somebody
would have notice something?

157
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,210
I used the infrared thermo scanner,
man. There was nothing.

158
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,600
So what? You think
Jim Miller killed himself?

159
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:28,260
And my dream was some sort of
freakish coincidence?

160
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,760
I don't know.

161
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,110
I'm pretty sure there's nothing
supernatural about that house.

162
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,670
Yeah.

163
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,190
Well...

164
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,890
You know, maybe...

165
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,110
Maybe there's nothing
to do with the house.

166
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,270
Maybe it's just a...

167
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,500
Gosh.
Maybe it's connected to Jim.

168
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,660
In some other way.

169
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,790
What's wrong with you?

170
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,770
My head!

171
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,100
Sam?

172
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,650
Hey!

173
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,060
Hey!

174
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,350
What's going on?
Talk to me.

175
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,010
It's happening again!

176
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,260
Something's gonna kill Roger Miller.

177
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,040
Roger Miller?

178
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,460
No, no, just the address please.

179
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,570
Okay, thanks.

180
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,810
450 West Grove.
Apartment 1120.

181
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,550
You okay?

182
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,180
Yeah. / If you're goon hurl.
I'll pull the car over, you know.

183
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,530
I'm fine. Just drive.

184
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,130
All right.

185
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,470
Dean, I'm scared man.

186
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,100
These nightmares weren't bad enough.

187
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,700
Now I'm seeing things when I'm awake?

188
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,070
And theses...

189
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:24,060
Visions or whatever.
They're getting intense, painful.

190
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,520
Come on man. You'll be all right.

191
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,580
- You'll be fine.
- What is it about the Millers?

192
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,540
Why am I connected to them?
Why am I watching them die?

193
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,970
- Why the hell is this happening to me?
- I don't know Sam.

194
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,910
But we'll figure it out, okay?

195
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,860
We face the unexplainable every
single day. This is just another thing.

196
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,300
No. It's never been us.

197
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,830
It's never been in the family like this.

198
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,360
Tell the truth. You can't tell me
this doesn't freak you out.

199
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,190
This doesn't freak me out.

200
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,250
Hey, Roger!

201
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,410
Hey, hold up a second.

202
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,490
What are you guys, missionaries?
Leave me alone.

203
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,990
Please!

204
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,590
Hey! Roger!

205
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,670
We're trying to help!
Please! Hey, hey, hey!

206
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,360
Hey, hey, hey!

207
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,320
I don't want your help.

208
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,970
We're not priests.
You've got to listen to us!

209
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,220
Roger, you're in danger!

210
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,190
Come on, come on.

211
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,180
Here.

212
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,910
Start wiping down your finger prints.

213
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,990
We don't want the cops
to know we were here.

214
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,830
Go! Go! Come on!

215
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,860
I'm gonna take a look inside.

216
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,190
I'm telling you
there was nothing in there.

217
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,440
There's no signs either.
Just like the Miller's house.

218
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,380
I saw something in the vision.
Like a dark shape.

219
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,540
Something was...

220
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,220
Something was stalking Roger.

221
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,940
Well, whatever it was I'm sure
it's not connected to their house.

222
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,050
No, it's connected to the family itself.

223
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,430
So, what do you think?
Like a ventral spirit?

224
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,750
Oh, yeah. Few of them have been
known to ledge horn to families.

225
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,290
They'll haunt them for years.

226
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,970
Angier, Badges.

227
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,260
Basically it was like a curse.

228
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,790
Maybe Roger and Jim Miller
got involved in something heavy.

229
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,850
- Something curse worthy.
- And now something's out for revenge.

230
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,900
And they're making their family dying.

231
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,590
Hey, you think Max is in danger?

232
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,200
Let's figure out before he is.

233
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,330
Well... I know one thing I have
in common with these people.

234
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,990
What's that?

235
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,310
Well, their families are cursed.

236
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,220
Our family's not cursed.

237
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,470
We're just had our dark spots.

238
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,040
Our dark spots are...

239
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,110
pretty dark.

240
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,150
You're dark.

241
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,140
My mom's resting.
She's pretty packed. / Of course.

242
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,580
All these people kept coming
with like casseroles.

243
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,060
I finally had to tell them all
to go away.

244
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,390
You know, cause nothing says
I'm sorry like a tuna casserole.

245
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,630
How are you holding up?

246
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm okay.

247
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,690
Your dad and your uncle were close?

248
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,410
Yeah, I guess.
They were brothers.

249
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,060
I use to hang out when I was little.

250
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,170
- But not lately, much?
- No, it's not that. It's...

251
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
We used to be neighbors
when I was a kid.

252
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,800
We lived across town
in this house and...

253
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,400
Uncle Roger lived next door
so he was over all the time. / Right.

254
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,460
So how was it in that house
when you were a kid?

255
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,560
It was fine.

256
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,410
Why?

257
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,730
All good memories?

258
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,420
You remember anything unusual?

259
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,660
Something involving your
father and your uncle maybe?

260
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,710
Why do you...?

261
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,310
Why do you ask?

262
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,230
It's just a question.

263
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,850
No, there was nothing.
We were totally normal.

264
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,570
Happy. / Good.

265
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,010
That's good.

266
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, you must be exhausted.

267
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,370
- We should take off.
- Right.

268
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,680
Thanks. / Yeah.

269
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,730
Nobody's family is totally
normal and happy.

270
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,980
You see when he was talking
about his old house?

271
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,020
Sounded scared.

272
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,880
Max isn't telling us everything.

273
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,680
See we go find the old neighborhood?

274
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,320
Find out what life it was with the Millers.

275
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
Have you lived in the
neighborhood very long?

276
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,960
Yeah, almost twenty years now.

277
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,130
It's nice and quiet.

278
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,230
Why you looking to buy?

279
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,200
No, no, actually
we were just wondering if...

280
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,860
If you might recall a family that use to
live right across the street I believe.

281
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,170
Yeah, the Millers.
They had a little boy named Max.

282
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,830
Right.

283
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,580
Yeah, I remember.

284
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,440
Their brother had the place next door.

285
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,780
So, what's this about?

286
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,830
That poor kid okay?

287
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,850
What do you mean?

288
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,190
Well, in my life. I've never seen
a child treated like that.

289
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,470
I mean, I'd hear Mr. Miller

290
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,760
yelling and throwing things
clear across the street. He was a...

291
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,440
mean drunk.

292
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,290
Used to beat the tire out of Max.

293
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,920
Bruises. Broke his arm
two times that I know of.

294
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,310
And this was going on regularly?

295
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,030
Practically everyday.

296
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,760
In fact that thug brother of his

297
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,150
was just as likely take a swing at the boy.
But the worst part...

298
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,010
was his step mother.

299
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,150
She just...

300
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,400
Stand there, checked out.
Never lifted a finger to protect him.

301
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,910
I must have called the police
seven or eight times.

302
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,390
- Never did any good.
- Now, you said 'step mother'.

303
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,330
I think his real mom died.
Some sort of...

304
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,140
Accident. Car accident I think.

305
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,260
Are you okay there?

306
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,090
- Uh, yeah.
- Thanks for your time.

307
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,210
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.
- Let's go.

308
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,870
Oh, god.

309
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,550
I don't know what you mean by that.

310
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,700
- You know I didn't do anything.
- That's right.

311
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,100
You didn't do anything.

312
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,290
You didn't stop them.
Not once.

313
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,740
How did you...?

314
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,880
Max!
Please!

315
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,190
But every time you
stood there and watched.

316
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,370
Pretending it wasn't happening.

317
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,510
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

318
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,900
You just don't want to die.

319
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,030
Max is doing it.

320
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,080
Everything I've been seeing.

321
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,980
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah, I saw him.

322
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,520
How is he pulling it off?

323
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,400
I don't know.
Looks like telekinesis.

324
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,220
So, he's Psychic?
He's a spoon bender?

325
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,780
I didn't even realize but
this whole time he was there.

326
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,060
He was outside of the garage
when his dad died.

327
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,310
He was in the apartment
when his uncle died.

328
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,750
His visions this whole time.

329
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,350
I wasn't connected to the Millers.
I was connecting to Max.

330
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,190
The thing I don't know is why man.
I guess...

331
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,970
Cause we are so alike?

332
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,700
What are you talking about?
Dude's nothing like you.

333
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,030
Oh, we both have psychic abilities.

334
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,610
We're both... / Both what?

335
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,130
Sam, Max is a monster.

336
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,050
He's already killed two people
now he's going for a third.

337
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,660
With all he went through.
The beatings.

338
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,000
To want revenge on those people.

339
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,560
I'm sorry man, I hate to say it.
It's not that insane.

340
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,990
Yeah, but it doesn't justify
murdering your entire family.

341
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,380
Dean... / He's no different
than anything else we've hunted.

342
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,240
All right, we've got to end it.

343
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,270
We're not gonna kill Max.

344
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,480
Then what?

345
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,660
I hand him over to the cops and say
Lock him up, officer.

346
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,990
- He kills with his power of his mind.
- Forget it.

347
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,540
- No way man.
- Sam! Do...

348
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,270
He's a person.

349
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,560
We can talk to him.

350
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,170
Hey! Promise me you'll
follow my lead on this one.

351
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,590
All right, fine.

352
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,900
But I'm not letting him hurt anyone else.

353
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,980
- You know I never did anything.
- That's right.

354
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,930
You didn't do anything.

355
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,280
You didn't stop them.
Not once.

356
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,140
Fathers?

357
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,400
- What are you doing here?
- Oh...

358
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,100
Sorry to interrupt.

359
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,760
Max, could we uh...

360
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,770
Could we talk to you outside
for just one second?

361
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,920
About what?

362
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,760
It's... It's private.

363
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,460
Um... I wouldn't want to
bother your mother with it.

364
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,360
We won't be long at all though.
I promise.

365
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,570
Okay.

366
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,950
Great.

367
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,040
You're not priests!

368
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,160
Max! What's happening?

369
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,410
Shut up! / What are you doing?

370
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,160
- I said shut up!
- Max, calm down.

371
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,030
- Who are you?
- We just want to talk to you.

372
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,870
Yeah, right.
That's why you brought this.

373
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,490
That was a mistake, all right?

374
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,670
So was lying about who we were.
But no more lying Max.

375
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,430
Okay? Just please.

376
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,580
- Just hear me out.
- About what?

377
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,550
I saw you do it.

378
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,530
I saw you kill your dad and
your uncle before it happened.

379
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,060
What? / I'm having
visions about you.

380
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,880
You're crazy.

381
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,080
So, you weren't gonna launch
a knife at your step mom?

382
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,360
Right here?

383
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,810
Isn't that hard to believe?
Max, look what you can do?

384
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,610
Max, I was drawn here, all right?

385
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,910
I think I'm here to help you.

386
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,150
No one can help me.

387
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,450
Let me try.

388
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,840
We'll just talk.

389
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,140
Me and you.

390
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:04,240
- We'll get Dean and Alice out of here.
- No, no way.

391
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,950
Nobody leaves this house!

392
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,340
And nobody has to, all right?
They'll just...

393
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,570
They'll just go upstairs.

394
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,290
Sam, I'm not leaving you
alone with him.

395
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,870
Yes, you are.

396
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,390
Look, Max...

397
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,580
You're in charge here.
All right? We all know that.

398
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,740
No one's gonna do anything
that you don't want to do.

399
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,160
But I'm talking five minutes
here man. / Sam...

400
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,820
Five minutes?

401
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,210
Go.

402
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,850
Come on.

403
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,660
Look.

404
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,160
I can't begin to understand
what you went through.

405
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,700
That's right, you can't. / Max...

406
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,120
- This has to stop.
- It will.

407
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,510
- After my step mother...
- No.

408
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,420
You need to let her go.

409
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,150
Why?

410
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,950
Did she beat you?

411
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,250
No.

412
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,700
But she never tried to save me.
She's part of it too.

413
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,550
Look what they did to you.

414
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,330
Look what they all did to you growing up.

415
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,070
- They deserve to be punished.
- Growing up?

416
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,850
Try last week.

417
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,070
My dad still hits me.

418
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,470
Just in places people wouldn't see it.

419
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,460
Old habits die hard I guess.

420
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,890
I'm sorry.

421
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,890
When I first found out
I could move things.

422
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,140
It was a gift.

423
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,180
My whole life I was helpless.

424
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,680
But now I have this.

425
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,730
So, last week...

426
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,910
Dad gets drunk.

427
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,300
First time in a long time.

428
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,620
And he beats me to hell.

429
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,290
It's the first time in a long time.

430
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,120
And I do what I had to do.

431
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,810
Why didn't you just leave?

432
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,460
It isn't about getting away.

433
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,350
Just knowing that
they'd still be out there.

434
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,530
It was about
not being afraid.

435
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,830
When my dad used to look at me.

436
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,470
There was hate in his eyes.

437
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,910
Do you know what that feels like?

438
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,200
No.

439
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,210
He blamed me for everything.

440
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,180
For his job.
For his life.

441
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,900
For my mom's death.

442
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,120
Why did he blame you
for your mom's death?

443
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,250
Because she died in my nursery.

444
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,470
While I was asleep in my crib.

445
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,660
As if that makes it my fault.

446
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,830
She died in your nursery?

447
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,030
Yeah.

448
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,020
There was a fire and he get drunk

449
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,960
and blab along like she
died in some insane way.

450
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,300
He said that she burned up.

451
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,050
Pinned to the ceiling.

452
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,010
Listen to me Max.

453
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,050
What your dad said.

454
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,680
About what happened to your mom.

455
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,760
It's real.

456
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,500
What?

457
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,470
It happened to my mom too.

458
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,350
Exactly the same.

459
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,170
My nursery, my crib.

460
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,860
My dad saw her in the ceiling.

461
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,630
Your dad must have been
as drunk as mine. / No.

462
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,460
No, it's the same thing, Max.

463
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,630
The same thing killed our mothers.

464
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,880
That's impossible.

465
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,670
This must be why I've been
having visions during the day.

466
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,130
Why they're getting more intense.

467
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,620
Cause you and I must be
connected in some way.

468
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,550
Your abilities started six,
seven months ago, right?

469
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,320
Out of the blue?

470
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,620
How'd you know that?

471
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,600
Because that's when
my abilities started Max.

472
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,100
I mean, yours seem to be
much further along but still this...

473
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,240
This means something. Right?

474
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:29,010
I mean, for some reason.
You and I were chosen.

475
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,750
For what?

476
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,510
I don't know.

477
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,350
But Dean and I...
My brother and I...

478
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,470
We're hunting for your mom's killer.

479
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,090
We can find answers.

480
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,600
Answers that can answer us both.

481
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,070
But you got to let us go Max.

482
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,570
You got to let your step mother go.

483
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,810
No.

484
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,030
What they did to me.

485
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,730
I still have nightmares.

486
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,390
I'm still scared all the time.
Like...

487
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,760
I'm waiting for that next beating.

488
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,640
I'm just tired of being scared.
If I do this, it'll be all over.

489
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,190
No, don't you get it?

490
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,260
It won't.

491
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,000
The nightmares won't end Max.

492
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,780
Not like this.

493
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,520
There's just...

494
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,560
More pain.

495
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,330
And it makes you as bad as them.

496
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Max...

497
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,110
You don't have to go this
all by yourself.

498
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,920
I'm sorry.

499
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,990
No!

500
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,280
Max!

501
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,430
No!

502
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,820
Max!

503
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,000
Max!

504
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,660
Son of a...

505
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,640
Max.

506
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,730
Max.

507
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,330
No.

508
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,260
Max.

509
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,780
Stay back.

510
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,880
It's not about you.

511
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,860
If you want to kill.
You got to go through with me first.

512
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,730
Okay.

513
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,640
No!

514
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,870
No!

515
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,870
Max...

516
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,380
No.

517
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,790
Stay back.

518
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,610
It's not about you.

519
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:39,010
If you want to kill.
You got to go through with me first.

520
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,580
Okay.

521
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,650
No, don't! Don't!

522
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,080
Please! Please Max!

523
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,610
Max...

524
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,930
We can help you.

525
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,970
But this...
What you're doing...

526
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,210
It's not the solution.

527
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,430
It's not gonna fix anything.

528
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,550
You're right.

529
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,570
No!

530
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,710
Max attacked me.

531
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,410
He threatened me with a gun.

532
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,950
And these two?

533
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,800
They're...

534
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,170
Family friends.

535
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:46,600
I called them as soon as
Max arrived. I was scared.

536
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,190
They tried to stop him.

537
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,610
They fought for the gun.

538
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,560
Where did Max hid the gun?

539
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,550
I don't know. He...

540
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,770
Showed up and he...

541
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,290
It's all right, Mrs. Miller.

542
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,850
I lost everyone.

543
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,450
Okay.

544
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,780
We'll give you a call if
we have any further questions.

545
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,510
Thanks officer.

546
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,310
Come on.

547
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,120
Freggis said something else.

548
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,690
- Got him through it somehow.
- Don't do that.

549
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,840
- Do what?
- Told you yourself.

550
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,590
It wouldn't matter what you said.
Max was too far gone.

551
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,330
When I think about how he
looked at me man right before...

552
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,800
I should have done something.

553
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,930
Come on, man.
You risked your life.

554
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,240
I mean, yeah. If we gotten
there twenty years earlier...

555
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,760
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

556
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,840
We're lucky we had dad.

557
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,780
I never thought you say that.

558
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,200
Well...

559
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,760
He could have gone away
more after mom.

560
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:14,070
A little more tequila
a little less demon hunting.

561
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,410
Then we would have Max's childhood.

562
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,770
All things considered.

563
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,080
We turned out okay.

564
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,340
Thanks to him.

565
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,020
All things considered.

566
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,000
Dean, I've been thinking.

567
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,170
That's never a good thing.

568
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,010
I'm serious. I've been thinking...

569
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,610
Why would this demon or whatever it is.
Why would it...

570
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,970
kill mom and Jessica and Max's mother?

571
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,530
You know, what does it want?

572
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,680
- No idea.
- Well, you think maybe...

573
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,540
It was after us?
After...

574
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,270
- Max and me?
- Why would you think that?

575
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,720
I mean...

576
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,640
Either telekinesis are premonitions.

577
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,500
We both had abilities, you know.

578
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,580
Maybe it was after us
for some reason.

579
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,610
Sam, if it wanted you.
It would have just taken you.

580
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,750
Okay?

581
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,300
This is not your fault.

582
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,050
It is not about you.

583
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,760
Then what is it about?

584
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,340
It's about that damn thing
that did this to our family.

585
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:22,010
That thing that we're gonna find
that thing we're gonna kill.

586
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,080
And that's all.

587
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,630
Actually, there's a...

588
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,950
Something else too.

589
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,880
Oh, geez what?

590
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,990
When Max locked me in that closet.

591
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:38,070
That big cabinet against the door.

592
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,330
I moved it.

593
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,060
Yeah, you're a little more up the
body strength than I gave you credit for.

594
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,960
No man. I moved it.
Like...

595
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,010
Max.

596
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,390
Oh.

597
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,110
Right.

598
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,990
Yeah.

599
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,500
Bend this.

600
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,340
I can't turn it on and off Dean.

601
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,750
- Then how'd you do it?
- I don't know.

602
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,830
I can't control it. I just...

603
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,260
I saw you die and it just came
out of me like a... Like a punch.

604
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,530
You know, like a...

605
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,220
Like a freak adrenaline thing.

606
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,120
Well, I'm sure it won't happen again.

607
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,480
Yeah, maybe.

608
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,590
Aren't you worried man?

609
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,200
Aren't you worried that
I can turn into Max or something?

610
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,840
Nope. No way.

611
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,170
You know why?

612
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,790
No, why?

613
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,980
Cause you got one advantage
that Max didn't have.

614
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,660
Dad?

615
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,980
Because dad's not here, Dean.

616
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,590
No.

617
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,170
Me.

618
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,900
As long as I'm around...

619
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,580
Nothing bad is gonna happen to you.

620
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,730
Now then.

621
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,490
I know what we need to do
with your premonitions.

622
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,430
I know where we've got to go.

623
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,410
Where?

624
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,640
Vegas.

625
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,570
What?
Come on man.

626
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,750
Craps table.
We'd clean up.
