1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,889
Ok, right about there...
I think that's it!

2
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:24,148
I can't believe we actually bought
this thing.

3
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,366
There's a reason charity auctions
have an open bar.

4
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,295
Don't you think...

5
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:31,875
I don't know. It's kind of... creepy?

6
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:35,783
It's okay.

7
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:38,043
I'll keep you safe.

8
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:40,922
Maybe you're the one I ought
to be scared of.

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,520
Let's go upstairs.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,529
Give me ten minutes to lock up.

11
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,777
Make that one minute.

12
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,949
If you don't hurry up,
I'm gonna start without you.

13
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:05,661
Babe, get the lights.
I can't see a thing.

14
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:13,308
Did you spill something?

15
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,326
Ann?

16
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,505
Ann?!

17
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:40,727
...3-4-2-0.

18
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:43,747
Alright. You're in there.

19
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:44,826
Perfect.

20
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:47,495
So, is that Brandi with a
"y" or a "i"?

21
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,798
Alright, listen. I gotta go.

22
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:08,757
Hold that thought,
I'll be right back, ok?

23
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:12,835
Alright. So, I think I've got something.

24
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,026
Oh, yeah, me too.

25
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:15,705
I think we need
to take a little shore leave,

26
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,694
just a little bit.
What do you think, huh?

27
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:19,013
I'm so in the door with this one.

28
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:19,953
So what are we today, Dean?

29
00:03:19,963 --> 00:03:22,628
Are we rockstars?
We're Army rangers?

30
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:25,281
We're LA tv scouts, looking for people
with special skills.

31
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:28,530
But, hey, it's not that far off, right?

32
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,730
By the way, she's got a friend over there.

33
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,249
I can probably hook you up.
What do you think?

34
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,658
Dean, uh, no thanks.
I can get my own dates.

35
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:35,837
Yeah, you can, but you don't.

36
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:38,667
What is that supposed to mean?

37
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:40,326
Nothing. What do you got?

38
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:42,605
Mark and Ann Telesca
of New Paltz, New York,

39
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:45,384
were both found dead in their home,
just a few days ago.

40
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:47,233
Sloats were slit,
there were no prints,

41
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:49,302
no murder weapons, all... Dean?

42
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:50,552
No prints, no murder weapons.

43
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:52,481
All doors and windows were locked
from the inside.

44
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:54,501
Could just be
a garden-variety murder.

45
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,750
- You know, not our department.
- No, dad says different.

46
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,199
- What do you mean?
- Look.

47
00:03:58,449 --> 00:03:59,728
Dad noted three murders

48
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:01,748
in the same area of upstate New York.

49
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:03,527
The first one, right here, in 1912.

50
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,796
The second one in 1945,

51
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:07,915
and the third in 1970.

52
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:10,335
The same M.O. as the Telescas...
the throats were slit,

53
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,724
the houses were locked from the inside.

54
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:13,583
Now, so much time passed
between the murders,

55
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:15,343
that nobody checked the pattern
except for dad.

56
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:17,293
He always kept his eyes peeled
for another one.

57
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:18,612
- And now we got one.
- Exactly.

58
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:20,751
Alright, I'm with you.
It's worth checking out.

59
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:23,230
We can't pick this up till
first thing, though, right?

60
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,900
- Yeah.
- Good.

61
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,279
Dean...

62
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,108
Ladies, did you miss me?

63
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:29,278
I'm just kidding.

64
00:04:29,328 --> 00:04:32,437
Listen, I talked to my producer
and it is looking good...

65
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:50,090
Oh, man, it's so not cool.

66
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,639
I just swept the Telesca's house
with the EMF.

67
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,888
It's clean.

68
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,618
And last night, while you were...

69
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:57,268
out...

70
00:04:57,288 --> 00:04:59,956
- Oh, good times.
- I checked the history of the house.

71
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:01,436
No hantings, no violent crimes.

72
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:03,395
Nothing strange
about the Telescas themselves either.

73
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,475
Alright, so if it's not the people
and it's not the house,

74
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:07,924
then maybe it's the contents.

75
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:10,042
- A cursed object or something.
- The house is clean.

76
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:11,393
Yeah, I know, you said that.

77
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:12,382
No, I mean it's empty.

78
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,331
No furniture, nothing.

79
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:15,501
Where's all their stuff?

80
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,740
Consignement auctions, estate sales...

81
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:49,138
lit's like a garage sale for WASPs
if you ask me.

82
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:50,398
Can I help you, gentlemen?

83
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:55,306
I'd like some champagne, please.

84
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:57,795
He's not a waiter.

85
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:02,334
I'm Sam Connors.

86
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:06,473
That's my brother, Dean.

87
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:08,112
We are art dealers with Connors Limited.

88
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,261
- You're art dealers?
- That's right.

89
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,589
I'm Daniel Blake.
This is my auction house.

90
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:14,899
Now, gentlemen, this is a private showing,

91
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:17,618
and I don't remember seeing you
on the guest list.

92
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:19,597
We are there, chuckles.

93
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:21,256
You just need to take another look.

94
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:23,266
Oh, finally.

95
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:26,924
Cheers!

96
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:47,387
A fine example of american primitive,
wouldn't you say?

97
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:55,944
Oh, I'd say it's more Grant Wood
than Grandma Moses...

98
00:06:57,513 --> 00:06:58,883
But you knew that.

99
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:00,492
You just wanted to see if I did.

100
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,552
Guilty.

101
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:04,881
And clumsy, I apologize.

102
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,290
I'm Sarah Blake.

103
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:08,760
Sam.

104
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,219
This is my...

105
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:13,317
brother, Dean.

106
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:16,527
Can we get you some more mini-quiche?

107
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:18,366
Gnnbfffm, I'm good. Thanks.

108
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:21,484
So, can I help you with something?

109
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:23,154
Yeah, actually.

110
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:25,783
What can you tell us
about the Telesca estate?

111
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:28,512
The whole thing is pretty grisly
if you ask me,

112
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:30,431
selling their things as soon.

113
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:32,081
But dad's right about one thing...

114
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:34,670
sensational is to bring out the crowds.

115
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,979
Even the rich ones.

116
00:07:39,737 --> 00:07:41,727
Is it possible to see the provenances?

117
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:44,226
I'm afraid there is any chance of that.

118
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,535
- Why not?
- You're not on the guest list.

119
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:50,384
And I think it's time to leave.

120
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,333
- Well, we don't have to be told twice.
- Apparently you do.

121
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:53,363
Ok, it's alright.

122
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:56,152
We don't want any trouble.
We'll go.

123
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,469
Dad, that was rude.

124
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:09,806
Grant Wood, Grandma Moses... what?

125
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:10,926
Art History course.

126
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:12,946
It's good for meeting girls.

127
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:14,715
It's like I don't even know you.

128
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,247
And what was the providence?

129
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:35,328
Provenance.

130
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:36,747
It's the certificate of origin,

131
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,196
like a biography, you know.

132
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:40,115
We can use them to track the history
of the pieces,

133
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:41,905
see if anything's got a freaky past.

134
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:43,435
We're not getting anything
out of chuckles,

135
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:45,284
- But uh, Sarah...
- Yeah.

136
00:08:45,314 --> 00:08:47,523
Maybe you can get her to write it all down
on a cocktail napkin.

137
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:48,602
Not me.

138
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:50,142
Oh, no, no, no, no.

139
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:51,502
Pickups are your thing, Dean.

140
00:08:51,522 --> 00:08:53,221
It wasn't my butt she was checking out.

141
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,979
In other words, you want me to use her
to get information.

142
00:08:57,099 --> 00:08:58,849
Sometimes, you've got to take one
for the team.

143
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,138
Call her.

144
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:06,037
Nice place.

145
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:07,886
Yeah.

146
00:09:15,703 --> 00:09:16,762
Glad you called.

147
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:19,871
Surprised, but glad.

148
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:20,890
Yeah?

149
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,251
Although you seem to have a hard time

150
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:25,439
getting out the words
"would you like to have dinner"?

151
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:27,188
Yeah.

152
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:30,058
I haven't really been on a date
in a while.

153
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:31,477
Welcome to the club.

154
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:32,826
You're kidding me.

155
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:35,845
- Here we are.
- Thanks.

156
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:39,044
The wine list.

157
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:56,518
I don't know about Romeo here,
but I'll have a beer.

158
00:09:58,727 --> 00:09:59,716
And you?

159
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:01,006
I will too.

160
00:10:01,036 --> 00:10:01,846
Certainly.

161
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:04,305
So, you studied Art in school, huh?

162
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:05,184
It's true.

163
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:06,394
I was an artist...

164
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:09,673
a terrible, terrible artist.

165
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,122
That's why I'm in the auction business.

166
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,601
And you were in pre-law?

167
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,661
Yeah.

168
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:17,100
But you didn't go to law school.
How come?

169
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,128
Uh, it's a really long story
for another time.

170
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:23,657
You're not like any art dealer
I've ever met.

171
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:30,765
So... what did you mean when you said

172
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,375
you hadn't been on a date in a while?

173
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:33,874
Tried to make me feel like
I'm not such a "loser"?

174
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:36,013
I'm sure you're many things, Sam.

175
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:38,792
I'm also sure "loser" isn't one of them.

176
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:45,609
It was my mom.

177
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,789
She died about a year ago.

178
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:50,648
Totally unexpected.

179
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:53,626
It really threw me.

180
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:57,945
I went into a shell...

181
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,624
a nice, warn, safe shell.

182
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,404
But lately I've been thinking...

183
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:05,622
it's not what she would have wanted
for me.

184
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:08,331
So...

185
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,519
So, what about you?

186
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,538
You're a reasonably attractive guy.

187
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:20,107
Reasonably?

188
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,156
Why haven't you been out and about?

189
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:34,962
Another long story for another time.

190
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,689
So she just handed the providences
over to you?

191
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:43,839
Provenances.

192
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:46,277
- Pro-ve-nan-ces?
- Yeah, we went back to her place,

193
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,777
I got a copy of the papers.

194
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:50,276
And?

195
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,075
And nothing. That's it.
I left.

196
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:57,653
You didn't have to con her or
do any special favors?

197
00:11:57,693 --> 00:11:59,603
Would you get your mind out of the gutter,
please?

198
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,052
When this whole thing's done,
we could stick around for a little bit.

199
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:03,741
- Why?
- So you can take her out again.

200
00:12:03,781 --> 00:12:05,540
It's obvious you're into her.
Even I can see that.

201
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,750
Hey, alright, I think
I've got something here.

202
00:12:11,828 --> 00:12:13,547
"Portrait of Isaiah Merchant's family,

203
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:14,867
painted in 1910."

204
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:16,886
Now, compare the names of the owners
with dad's journal.

205
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:24,643
"First purchased in 1912, to Peter Sims".

206
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:26,782
Peter Sims was murdered in 1912.

207
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,230
Same thing in 1945.

208
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,079
Oh, same thing in 1970.

209
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,279
Then stored,

210
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:39,158
until it was donated to a charity auction
last month,

211
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:40,987
where the Telescas bought it.

212
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:43,046
So what do you think?
It's haunted or cursed?

213
00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:45,306
Eitherway, it's toast.

214
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,047
Go ahead.

215
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,021
Ugly ass thing.

216
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,130
If you ask me, we're doing
the art world a favor.

217
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:26,498
We've got a problem.
I can't find my wallet.

218
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:28,298
How is that my problem?

219
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:30,347
'Cause I think I dropped it
in the warehouse last night.

220
00:14:32,176 --> 00:14:33,136
You're kidding, right?

221
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:34,796
I mean, it's got my prints, my ID...

222
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:35,860
well my fake ID anyway but

223
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:38,054
we've got to get it before
somebody else finds it. Come on.

224
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,730
How did you lose your wallet, Dean?

225
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:53,898
Hey guys.

226
00:14:53,938 --> 00:14:55,428
Sarah. Hey.

227
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:57,197
What are you doing here?

228
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:01,036
We... we are leaving town,

229
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:02,975
and you know,
we came to say goodbye.

230
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:04,604
What are you talking about, Sam?

231
00:15:04,624 --> 00:15:06,634
We're sticking around for at least
another day or two.

232
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,463
Oh, Sam, by the way,

233
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:11,872
I wanted to give you
that 20 bucks I owe you.

234
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:13,832
I always forget.

235
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:16,900
There you go.

236
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,518
Well, I leave you two crazy kids alone.
I got to go do...

237
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,667
something... somewhere...

238
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:32,674
So...

239
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,613
I had a good time last night.

240
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,562
Yeah, yeah. I did too.

241
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,262
Maybe we should do it again sometime.

242
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:43,640
You know, I'd love to,
I really would

243
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,790
but Dean...
he was just screwing around.

244
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,969
We really are taking off today.

245
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:50,627
That's too bad.

246
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:53,047
- Oh, my god!
- What?

247
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:54,686
The...

248
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:56,266
That painting...

249
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,265
looks so good.

250
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,904
If you can call that monstruosity good,

251
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:03,513
then yeah, I guess.

252
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:05,592
Sarah, what do you know
about that painting?

253
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:07,851
Not much.
Just that it creeps me out.

254
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:11,380
We sold it to the Telescas at a charity auction
the night they were murdered.

255
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,739
And now you're just gonna sell it again?

256
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,788
As much as my dad wants to, no.
I won't let him.

257
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:18,348
I think it'd be in bad taste.

258
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:19,577
Yeah. Good. You know what?
Don't. Don't.

259
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:21,436
- Make sure you don't, ok?
- Why?

260
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,635
Don't tell me you're interested in that?

261
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:25,545
No, god, no.
Not buying. No.

262
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:26,375
You know what?

263
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:28,004
I gotta go. I gotta take care of something.

264
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:29,413
But uh... I will call you back.

265
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,282
- I'll see you later.
- Wait. So,

266
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,642
you're not leaving tonight?

267
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,441
No, I guess not.
I'll see you.

268
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:40,260
Ok.

269
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,647
I don't understand, Dean.
We burned the damn thing!

270
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:47,667
Yeah, thank you, Captain Obvious.

271
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:50,596
Alright, we just need to figure out
another way to get rid of it.

272
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,394
- Any ideas?
- Ok, alright.

273
00:16:53,494 --> 00:16:55,264
In almost all the lore
about haunted paintings

274
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:57,413
it's always the painting subject
that haunts them.

275
00:16:57,523 --> 00:16:58,813
Yeah.

276
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:00,502
So we need to figure out everything
there is to know

277
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,341
about that creepy ass family
in that creepy ass painting.

278
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:05,730
What were their names again?

279
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,019
You said the Isaiah Merchant family,
right?

280
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,208
Yeah, that's right.

281
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:13,627
I dug up every scrap of the local history
I could find.

282
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:16,026
So, uh,are you boys crime buffs?

283
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:18,075
Kind of...
Why do you ask?

284
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,665
W ell...

285
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:25,173
Yes. That sounds about right.

286
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:26,613
The whole family was killed?

287
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:29,342
It seems that this Isaiah,
he slits his kids' throats

288
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:31,361
then his wife, then himself.

289
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:35,470
He was a barber by trade.
He used a straight razor.

290
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:37,798
- Why'd he do it?
- Well, let's look.

291
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:40,927
"People who knew him describe Isaiah

292
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,587
"as having a stern and harsh temperament,

293
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:44,956
to control his family with iron fist".

294
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:48,424
A wife, two sons,
adopted daughter... Yeah, yeah.

295
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:50,984
There were whispers that the wife
was gonna take the kids

296
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,372
and leave, which, of course,
you know, in that day and age...

297
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:58,481
So instead, old man Isaiah,
he gave them all a shave.

298
00:17:58,521 --> 00:17:59,441
Couic!

299
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,029
Does it say what happened to the bodies?

300
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,658
Just that they were cremated.

301
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:09,007
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

302
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:12,175
Actually I found a picture of the family.

303
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:13,305
It's right here, somewhere.

304
00:18:13,516 --> 00:18:15,225
Right. Here it is.

305
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:26,200
Hey, could we get a copy of this, please?

306
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,990
Sure.

307
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:33,088
Dad...

308
00:18:33,138 --> 00:18:35,257
You promised you wouldn't sell
that painting.

309
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:38,386
I know sweetie, but Evelyn's offered
a persuasive amount of money.

310
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:41,805
You're shameless, you know that?

311
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:44,874
For that kind of money, I can afford to be.

312
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:51,511
I'm telling you, man. I'm sure of it.

313
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,591
The painting at the auctionhouse,
daddy's looking down.

314
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,850
The painting here, dad's looking out.

315
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,084
The painting has changed, Dean.

316
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,538
Alright, so you think daddy dearest
is trapped in the painting

317
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:00,818
and he’s handing out Colombian neckties

318
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,917
- like he did with his family?
- Yeah, it seems like it.

319
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:04,337
But if his bones are already dusted,

320
00:19:04,396 --> 00:19:05,746
then how are we gonna stop him?

321
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:10,415
If Isaiah's position changed, then maybe
some other things in the painting changed as well.

322
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:13,343
- It could give us some clues.
- What, like a "DaVinci Code" deal?

323
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:15,452
I don't know.

324
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:17,342
I'm still waiting for the movie on that one.

325
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:19,361
Anyway, we gotta get back in
to see that painting.

326
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:21,200
Which is a good thing 'cause
you can get some more time

327
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,500
to crush on your girlfriend.

328
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,359
Dude!

329
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,799
Enough already.

330
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,859
- What?
- "What"?!

331
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,707
Every since we got here,
you've been trying to pimp me out to Sarah.

332
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:31,216
- Juste back off, alright?
- Well, you like her, don't you?

333
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:34,466
Alright, you like her; she likes you.
You're both consenting adults.

334
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:35,475
What's the point, Dean?

335
00:19:35,535 --> 00:19:37,074
We'll just leave. We always leave.

336
00:19:37,154 --> 00:19:38,704
Well, I'm not talking about marriage, Sam.

337
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:40,684
You know, I don't get it.
What do you care if I hook up?

338
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,513
Because then maybe you wouldn't be
so cranky all the time.

339
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:49,910
You know, seriously, Sam,
this isn't about just kooking up, ok?

340
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,448
I think that this
Sarah girl could be good for you.

341
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:58,517
And I don't mean nay disrespect, but I...

342
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,215
I'm sure this is about Jessica, right?

343
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:04,105
Now, I don't know what it's like
to lose somebody like that...

344
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:06,594
but...

345
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:10,332
I would think that she would want you
to be happy.

346
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:14,221
God forbid have fun once in a while.

347
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,730
Wouldn't she?

348
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,948
Yeah, I know she would.

349
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:30,195
Yeah, you're right. A part of this
is about Jessica.

350
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:33,723
But not the main part.

351
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:35,503
What's about?

352
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:41,620
Yeah, alright.

353
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:44,670
Well, we still gotta see that painting,

354
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,989
which means
you still gotta call Sarah, so...

355
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:00,954
Sarah, hey. It's Sam.

356
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:05,302
Good, good, yeah.
What about you?

357
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:08,201
- Yeah, good, good, really good.
- Smooth.

358
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,510
So, uh... So listen.

359
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,049
Me and my brother we were thinking

360
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,550
that maybe we'd like to come back in

361
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,979
and look at the painting again.

362
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,368
I think maybe we are interested
in buying it.

363
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:19,307
Wait, what?

364
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:21,677
Who did you sell it to?

365
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:24,455
Sarah, I need her adress right now.

366
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:09,709
Sam, what's happening?

367
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,408
I told you,
you shouldn't have come.

368
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,087
Hello! Anybody home?!

369
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,845
You said Evelyn might be in danger.
What kind of danger?

370
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:20,984
I can't knock this sucker down.
I've got to pick it.

371
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:24,863
What are you guys, burglars?

372
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:26,882
I wish that was that simple.

373
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:28,921
Look, you really should wait in the car.
It's for your own good.

374
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:31,761
The hell I would!
Evelyn is a friend.

375
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:33,070
Evelyn?

376
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:53,792
It's Sarah Blake.

377
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:56,751
- Are you alright?
- Sarah, don't! Sarah!

378
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,319
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

379
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:15,564
Hey.

380
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,963
- You're alright?
- No, actually.

381
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:21,202
I just lied to the cops and told them
I went to Evelyn's, alone,

382
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:22,952
and found her like that.

383
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:25,490
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

384
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,850
I'm about to call them right back if
you don't tell me what the hell is going on.

385
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,679
Who is killing these people?

386
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:35,187
"What".

387
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:36,167
What?

388
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,386
It's not "who".

389
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:40,775
It's "what" is killing those people.

390
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:45,743
Sarah, you saw that painting move.

391
00:23:46,783 --> 00:23:48,022
No.

392
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:50,822
No, I was... I was seeing things.

393
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:52,131
It's impossible.

394
00:23:52,171 --> 00:23:53,760
Yeah, well, welcome to our world.

395
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,089
Sarah, I know this sounds crazy...

396
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:59,668
But we think that this painting is haunted.

397
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:04,766
You're jocking?

398
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,304
You're not jocking.

399
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:15,183
- God! The guys I go out with!
- Sarah, think about it.

400
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:18,831
Evelyn, the Telescas...
They both had the painting.

401
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:20,400
And there have been others before that.

402
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,910
Wherever this thing goes, people die.

403
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,719
And we're just trying to stop it...

404
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:25,589
And that's the truth.

405
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:29,707
Well, then I guess you'd better show me.

406
00:24:30,347 --> 00:24:31,307
I'm coming with you.

407
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,466
What? No.

408
00:24:32,686 --> 00:24:35,015
Sarah, no.
You should just go home.

409
00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:37,615
This stuff can get dangerous and...

410
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:41,952
And I don't want you to get hurt.

411
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,841
Look, you guys are probably crazy,

412
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:44,862
but if you're right about this,

413
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:46,501
when me and my dad sold that painting,

414
00:24:46,561 --> 00:24:48,530
we might have got those people killed.

415
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,499
Look, I'm not saying I'm not scared,
because I am scared as hell,

416
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,619
but I'm not going to run and hide, either.

417
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:58,166
So, are we going or what?

418
00:24:59,086 --> 00:25:00,005
Sam...

419
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:02,925
Marry that girl.

420
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:07,423
Uh...

421
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:09,073
isn’t this a crime scene?

422
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:11,722
Well, you’ve already lied to the cops.
What’s another infraction?

423
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:33,794
Aren't you worried that it's gonna...
you know, kill us?

424
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:35,993
No, it seems doing things at night.

425
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,712
I think we're alright in daylight.

426
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:43,240
Sam, check it out.

427
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,749
The razor, it's closed in this one

428
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,339
- but it's open in that one.
- What are you guys looking for?

429
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,038
Well if the spirit's changing aspects
of the painting,

430
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:50,857
maybe it's doing so for a reason.

431
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:53,661
Hey, look at this.

432
00:25:53,696 --> 00:25:55,546
The painting in the painting.

433
00:26:00,504 --> 00:26:02,923
It looks like a crypt or a mausoleum
or something.

434
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,459
"Merchant".

435
00:26:22,865 --> 00:26:25,414
It's the third bone yard we've checked.

436
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:29,093
I think this ghost is jerking us around.

437
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:31,862
So, this is what you guys do
for a living?

438
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:34,062
Not exactly.

439
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:36,211
We don't get paid.

440
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:39,279
Well, mazel tov.

441
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:42,819
Over there.

442
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:19,884
Ok, that right there is the creepiest thing
I've ever seen.

443
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:22,804
That was sort of a tradition
at the time.

444
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:24,353
Whenever a child died,

445
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:26,952
sometimes they preserved
the kid's favourite toy

446
00:27:26,982 --> 00:27:29,671
in a glass case, put it next to
the headstone in the crypt.

447
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,629
Notice any strange here?

448
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:38,258
Uh, where do I start?

449
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:39,318
No, it's not what I mean.

450
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:40,977
Look at the urns.

451
00:27:43,196 --> 00:27:46,155
- Yeah, they're only 4.
- Yeah, mom and the 3 kids.

452
00:27:46,585 --> 00:27:48,214
Daddy deariest isn't here.

453
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:51,832
So where is he?

454
00:27:52,983 --> 00:27:55,212
So what exactly is your brother
doing in there?

455
00:27:55,252 --> 00:27:56,831
Searching county death certificates,

456
00:27:56,871 --> 00:27:58,970
trying to find out what happened to
Isaiah's body.

457
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,230
How could he even get in the door?

458
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,088
Lying and subterfuges mostly.

459
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:09,777
You have uh...
You have an eyelash on your...

460
00:28:09,817 --> 00:28:11,536
You have it, right. No... You know what?

461
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:14,774
Do you mind if I...

462
00:28:14,814 --> 00:28:16,564
- No.
- Ok.

463
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:18,703
Ok, I got it.

464
00:28:19,773 --> 00:28:20,922
Make a wish.

465
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,319
Sam, can I ask you something?

466
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:31,879
- Yeah, sure.
- I don't mean to be forward,

467
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,807
but... "a girl could wait here forever".

468
00:28:36,436 --> 00:28:41,035
Is there something here, between us,
or am I delusional?

469
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:42,764
You're not delusional.

470
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:45,593
But, there is a "but" coming.

471
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:47,103
But...

472
00:28:48,982 --> 00:28:50,921
I don't think this would be
a good idea.

473
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,499
Can I ask why?

474
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,899
Because I like you.

475
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,827
Wait, you lost me.

476
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:05,236
Look, it's hard to explain.

477
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:09,494
It's just that when
people are around me...

478
00:29:10,774 --> 00:29:12,204
I don't know, they get hurt.

479
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:13,653
What do you mean?

480
00:29:13,723 --> 00:29:15,392
I mean like physically hurt.

481
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:18,871
With what my brother and I do, it's...

482
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:25,618
Sarah,

483
00:29:27,918 --> 00:29:29,707
I had a grilfriend.

484
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:33,445
And she died.

485
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:36,675
And my mom died too.

486
00:29:37,884 --> 00:29:39,083
I don't know, it's like...

487
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:42,942
It's like I'm cursed or something...

488
00:29:43,862 --> 00:29:46,011
Like death just follows me around.

489
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:48,220
Look, I'm not scared that much,

490
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,290
but if I let myself
have feelings for anybody...

491
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,799
You're scared they get hurt too.

492
00:29:55,007 --> 00:29:57,997
That's very sweet, and very archaic.

493
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:00,606
- Sorry?
- Look, I'm a big girl, Sam.

494
00:30:00,696 --> 00:30:02,895
It's not your job
to make decisions for me.

495
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:06,314
- There's always a chance of getting hurt.
- I'm not talking about a broken heart

496
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:07,853
and a tub of haagen-dazs.

497
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:09,202
I'm talking about life and death.

498
00:30:09,252 --> 00:30:10,852
And tomorrow I could get hit
by a bus.

499
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:12,101
That's what life is.

500
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:16,340
Look, I know losing somebody
you love is terrible,

501
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,458
You shut yourself off.
Believe me, I know.

502
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,808
But when you shut out pain...

503
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,147
you shut out everything else too.

504
00:30:25,177 --> 00:30:27,345
Sarah, you don't understand.
The pain that I went through...

505
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:30,875
I can't go through it again.

506
00:30:31,844 --> 00:30:32,794
I can't.

507
00:30:37,422 --> 00:30:38,662
Am I interrupting something?

508
00:30:39,352 --> 00:30:40,291
- No.
- Not at all.

509
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:41,610
Apparently.

510
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,060
So, what did you get?

511
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:46,719
Apparently, the surviving relatives
of the Merchant family

512
00:30:46,749 --> 00:30:48,038
were so ashamed of Isaiah

513
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:49,667
that they didn't want him interred
with the rest of the family.

514
00:30:49,707 --> 00:30:51,257
So they handed him over to the county.

515
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:53,277
County gave him a pauper's funeral.

516
00:30:53,307 --> 00:30:54,266
Economic style.

517
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,065
Turns out he wasn't cremated.
He was buried in a pine box.

518
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,614
So, there are bones to burn.

519
00:30:58,644 --> 00:31:00,684
- There are bones to burn.
- Tell me you know where.

520
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:15,649
You guys seem to be...

521
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:17,193
uncomfortably comfortable with this.

522
00:31:17,228 --> 00:31:19,876
Well, this isn't exactly the first grave
we've dug.

523
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:22,735
You still think I'm a catch?

524
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:27,314
I think I've got something.

525
00:31:52,294 --> 00:31:54,253
You've been a real pain in the ass,
Isaiah.

526
00:31:56,703 --> 00:31:58,093
Good riddance!

527
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,548
Dean, keep the motor running.

528
00:32:10,608 --> 00:32:12,387
I thought the paint was harmless now.

529
00:32:13,827 --> 00:32:15,016
Better safe than sorry.

530
00:32:15,236 --> 00:32:16,535
We're gonna bury the sucker.

531
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:18,106
- I wanna come with you.
- Are you sure?

532
00:32:20,395 --> 00:32:22,304
I stay here. You go make your move.

533
00:32:22,903 --> 00:32:24,662
Sam, I'm serious!

534
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:32,994
I'm in love with a girl
I'm talking about

535
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:36,897
I'm in love with a girl
I can't live without

536
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:40,766
I'm in love, but I feel like
I'm wearing it out

537
00:32:51,123 --> 00:32:52,463
Uh, Sam...

538
00:32:53,282 --> 00:32:56,021
You're the expert on all this ghost stuff.

539
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:58,101
Is that painting supposed to look
like that?

540
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,589
Where is the little girl?

541
00:33:04,328 --> 00:33:06,108
And the razor.

542
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:22,762
Dean!
Hey, is that you?!

543
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,211
Sammy, you're alright?!

544
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:31,089
Tell me you slammed the front door.

545
00:33:31,138 --> 00:33:32,448
No, it wasn't me.
I think it was the little girl.

546
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:34,837
- Girl? What girl?
- Yeah, she's out of the painting.

547
00:33:34,877 --> 00:33:36,056
I think it might have been her all along.

548
00:33:36,106 --> 00:33:37,686
Wasn't the dad looking down at her?

549
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,016
Maybe he was trying to warn us.

550
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:41,215
Let's recap later, alright?
Just get us out of here.

551
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:43,074
I'm trying to pick the lock,
but the door won't budge.

552
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:44,504
- Well break it down!
- Ok, genious.

553
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:47,013
- Let me grap my battering ram!
- The damn thing is coming!

554
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:48,952
Well you're gonna have to hold her off
until I figure something out.

555
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,451
- Get some salt or iron.
- Come on!

556
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,839
What kind of house doesn't have salt?

557
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:58,248
- Hey, you find any iron?
- No, what's it for?

558
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:00,088
Iron repels evil spirits,
but it's gotta be pure.

559
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:01,168
Hurry.

560
00:34:02,317 --> 00:34:04,336
Dean, give me a sec.
Don't go anywhere.

561
00:34:06,315 --> 00:34:07,935
Look at the chairs.
Sometimes, the seats...

562
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:27,478
Sam...

563
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:47,291
It's just so wrong.

564
00:35:08,382 --> 00:35:09,472
Iron?

565
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:11,542
Yeah.

566
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,961
Sam, you're ok?

567
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:15,120
Yeah, for now.

568
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,389
How are we gonna waste her?

569
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:18,080
I don't know.
She was already cremated.

570
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,258
- There's nothing left to burn.
- Well then why she's still around?

571
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:21,758
There must be something else.

572
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,027
Sam, wait.

573
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:26,157
We used to handle antique dolls
at the auction.

574
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:28,735
Well, that's fascinating, Sarah,
but important right now?

575
00:35:28,945 --> 00:35:32,493
Back then, they used to make
the dolls in the kids' image.

576
00:35:32,543 --> 00:35:33,644
I mean, everything.

577
00:35:33,684 --> 00:35:36,243
Like the... they would use
the kids' real hair.

578
00:35:36,273 --> 00:35:37,182
Dean?

579
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:39,341
Sarah says the doll might have
the girl's hair.

580
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:42,011
Humans remains...
Same as bones.

581
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,579
The mausoleum.

582
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,079
Come on, Dean.

583
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:00,482
Come on, come on!

584
00:37:50,793 --> 00:37:51,972
Sam, are you good?

585
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:57,331
Not bad.

586
00:38:15,204 --> 00:38:17,283
It was archived in the county records.

587
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,863
The Merchants' adoptive daughter,
M?lanie.

588
00:38:20,052 --> 00:38:21,382
Know why she was up for adoption?

589
00:38:21,512 --> 00:38:23,851
'Cause her real family was murdered
in their beds.

590
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,300
She killed them?

591
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,070
Yeah, who'd suspect her?
A sweet little girl.

592
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,809
So when she killes Isaiah
and his family,

593
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,898
the old man takes the blame.

594
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:33,057
His spirit was trying to warn people
ever since.

595
00:38:33,337 --> 00:38:34,637
Where is this one go?

596
00:38:34,717 --> 00:38:36,276
Take it out back and burn it.

597
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:41,325
I'm serious, guys. Thanks.

598
00:38:43,944 --> 00:38:45,523
So why'd the girl do it?

599
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:48,381
Killing others, killing herself...

600
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,322
Some people are just born tortured.

601
00:38:50,332 --> 00:38:52,910
So when they die,
the spirits are just as dark.

602
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,939
Maybe. I don't really care.
It's over. We move on.

603
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:01,067
I guess it means you're leaving.

604
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:08,684
I'll go wait in the car.

605
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,763
See you, Sarah.

606
00:39:14,972 --> 00:39:17,001
I'm the one who burnt the doll,
I destroyed the spirit,

607
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,561
but don't thank me or anything.

608
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:26,727
There are million things
that I want to say to you,

609
00:39:26,837 --> 00:39:30,437
but for the life of me,
I can't think of one.

610
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:31,746
Yeah, I'll miss you too.

611
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:35,794
You know, there's a lesson
in all of this.

612
00:39:35,804 --> 00:39:36,795
What's that?

613
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:39,263
We all got through this in one piece.

614
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:41,252
I didn't get hurt.

615
00:39:41,802 --> 00:39:43,321
Yeah, I'm glad for that.

616
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:45,941
So, maybe you're not cursed.

617
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,460
Maybe...

618
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:54,798
Maybe you'lle come back and see me.

619
00:39:58,676 --> 00:39:59,716
I will.

620
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,839
That's my boy.
