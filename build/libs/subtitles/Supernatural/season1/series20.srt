1
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,260
M. Elkins?

2
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,850
M. Elkins.

3
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,860
Would you like another?

4
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,420
Yeah. Thanks, Beth.

5
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,470
I thought they caught
the unabomber.

6
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,580
Yeah, poor M. Elkins lives
all alone up in the canyon.

7
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,230
Same seat every day,

8
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,440
going through his papers,
making his little notes.

9
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,600
He's a nice old man.
He's just a nut.

10
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,630
Here you go.

11
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,440
What'll you have?

12
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,140
Jack all around.
Leave the bottle.

13
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,290
You hungry?

14
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,810
We have dinner plans.

15
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,770
Can I get you something else,
M. Elkins?

16
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,590
It's been a while.

17
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,600
I got to say,
you look old.

18
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,840
- What do you want?
- What do you think?

19
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,200
Damn.

20
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
You can do better than that.

21
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,040
Come on, come on.

22
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,860
Nice gun.

23
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,430
Wouldn't do you much good,
of course.

24
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,760
Boys...

25
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,190
We're eating in tonight.

26
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,480
All right, dude,

27
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,750
not a decent lead in all of Nebraska.
What do you got?

28
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,130
Well, I been scanning Wyoming,
Colorado, south Dakota.

29
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,310
Here.

30
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,630
A woman in Iowa fell 10,000 feet
from an airplane and survived.

31
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,480
Sounds more like "that's incredible!"
than "the twilight zone".

32
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,700
Yeah.

33
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,090
Hey, you know, we could
just keep heading east...

34
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,240
New York, upstate.

35
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,510
Could stop by
and see Sarah again. Huh?

36
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,010
She's a cool chick, man.
Smokin'.

37
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,400
You two seemed pretty friendly.
What do you say?

38
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,930
Yeah. Maybe someday.

39
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,180
But in the meantime,

40
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,420
we got a lot of work to do,
Dean, and you know that.

41
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,020
Yeah, you're right.
What else you got?

42
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,270
Uh, man in Colorado.

43
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,000
Local man by the name of
Daniel Elkins

44
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:22,860
who was found mauled in his home.

45
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,760
Elkins. I know that name.

46
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,830
Doesn't ring a bell.

47
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,160
It sounds like the police
don't know what to think.

48
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,900
At first they said
it was some sort of bear attack,

49
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,200
and now they found
signs of robbery.

50
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,490
Yeah.

51
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,750
Here. Check it out.

52
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,090
You think
it's the same Elkins?

53
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,570
It's a Colorado area code.

54
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,300
Looks like the maid
didn't come today.

55
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,200
Hey, there's salt over here,
right inside the door.

56
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,380
You mean, like,
protection-against-demon salt

57
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,260
or "oops, I spilled
the popcorn" salt?

58
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,680
It's clearly a ring.

59
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,290
You think this guy Elkins
was a player?

60
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,350
Definitely.

61
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,820
That looks a hell of a lot
like dad's.

62
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,150
Except this dates back
to the '60s.

63
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,790
Whatever attacked him,
looks like there was more than one.

64
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,660
Looks like he put up
a hell of a fight, too.

65
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,930
Yeah.

66
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,330
You got something?

67
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,960
I don't know.
Some scratches in the floor.

68
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,250
Death throes maybe?

69
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,010
Maybe.

70
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,120
Or maybe a message.

71
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,170
Look familiar?

72
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,190
Three letters, six digits...

73
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,070
The location and combination
of a post office box.

74
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,350
It's a mail drop.

75
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,250
That's just the way
dad does it.

76
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,280
"J.W."... You think?
John Winchester?

77
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,070
I don't know.
Should we open it?

78
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,030
Dad?

79
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,270
Dad, what are you doing here?
Are you all right?

80
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,710
Yeah, I'm okay.

81
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,660
Look, I read the news
about Daniel.

82
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,710
I got here
as fast as I could.

83
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,470
I saw you two up at his place.

84
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,460
Why didn't you come in, dad?

85
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,710
You know why.

86
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,890
Because I had to make sure
you weren't followed...

87
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,740
By anyone...

88
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,650
Or anything.

89
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,970
Nice job of covering your tracks,
by the way.

90
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,630
Yeah, well, we learned
from the best.

91
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,610
Wait, so you came all the way
out here for this Elkins guy?

92
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,770
Yeah.

93
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,520
He was...

94
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,440
He was a good man.

95
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,880
He taught me a hell of a lot
about hunting.

96
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,650
You never mentioned him
to us.

97
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,890
We had a...

98
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,180
We had kind of a falling out.

99
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,930
I hadn't seen him in years.

100
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,400
I should look at that.

101
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,650
"If you're reading this,
I'm already dead".

102
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,070
- That son of a bitch.
- What is it?

103
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,310
- He had it the whole time.
- Dad, what?

104
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,240
When you searched the place,

105
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,130
did you see a gun, an antique,
a colt revolver?

106
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,220
Did you see it?

107
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,350
Uh, there was an old case,
but it was empty.

108
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,165
They have it.

109
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,550
- You mean whatever killed Elkins?
- We got to pick up their trail.

110
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,860
Wait.

111
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,350
You want us
to come with you?

112
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,640
If Elkins is telling the truth,
we've got to find this gun.

113
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,040
- The gun? why?
- Because it's important, that's why.

114
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,250
Dad, we don't even know
what these things are yet.

115
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,210
They were what Danny Elkins
killed best...

116
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,340
Vampires.

117
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,960
Vampires?

118
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,570
I thought there was
no such thing.

119
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,280
You never even
mentioned them, dad.

120
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:03,200
I thought they were extinct.

121
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,120
I thought Elkins and others
had wiped them out.

122
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,670
I was wrong.

123
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,720
Most vampire lore is crap.
A cross won't repel them.

124
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,500
Sunlight won't kill them

125
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,420
and neither will
a stake to the heart.

126
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,530
But the bloodlust...
that part's true.

127
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,450
They need fresh human blood
to survive.

128
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,830
They were once people,

129
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,610
So you won't know it's a vampire
until it's too late.

130
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,150
All yours, baby.

131
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,120
What?

132
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,020
Well, I guess
you showed that guy.

133
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,080
What guy?

134
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,420
The guy who bet you
you wouldn't buy that shirt.

135
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,550
I love this shirt.

136
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,920
Look out!

137
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,630
What happened to him?

138
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,360
Call 911.

139
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,900
22, I'm going out there.

140
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,370
Copy that.

141
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,880
Sam, Dean, let's go.

142
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,160
I picked up a police call.

143
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,320
What happened?

144
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,720
A couple called 911.
They found a body in the street.

145
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,490
Cops got there.
Everyone was missing.

146
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,670
It's the vampires.

147
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,040
How do you know?

148
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,840
Just follow me, okay?

149
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,810
Vampires.

150
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,060
It's funny every time I hear it.

151
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,290
I don't see why we couldn't have
gone over with him.

152
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,980
Oh, don't tell me
it's already starting.

153
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,660
What's starting?

154
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,940
- What do you got?
- It was them all right.

155
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,500
It looks like
they're heading west.

156
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,550
We have to double back
to get around that detour.

157
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,900
- How can you be so sure?
- Sam!

158
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,780
I just want to know we're going
in the right direction.

159
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,170
- We are.
- How do you know?

160
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,750
I found this.

161
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,730
It's a... vampire fang?

162
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,630
No fangs... Teeth. The second
set descends when they attack.

163
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,010
Any more questions?

164
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,290
Let's get out of here.
We're losing daylight.

165
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,950
And, Dean, why don't you touch up
your car before you get rust?

166
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,460
I wouldn't have given you
the damn thing

167
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,870
if I thought
you were gonna ruin it.

168
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,170
Vampires nest
in groups of 8 to 10.

169
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,520
Smaller packs are sent out
to hunt for food.

170
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,130
Victims are taken to the nest,
where the pack keeps them alive,

171
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,400
bleeding them
for days or weeks.

172
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,230
I wonder if that's what happened
to that 911 couple.

173
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,740
That's probably
what dad's thinking.

174
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,530
Of course, it would be nice if
he just told us what he thinks.

175
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,250
So it is starting.

176
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,350
What?

177
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,440
Sam, we've been looking for dad
all year.

178
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,080
Now we're not with him
for more than a couple of hours

179
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,310
and there's static already.

180
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,390
No.

181
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,240
Look, I'm happy he's okay,
all right,

182
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,670
and I'm happy that we're all
working together.

183
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,700
Good.

184
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,660
It's just the way he treats us
like we're children.

185
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,060
He barks orders at us, Dean.

186
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,340
He expects us to follow him
without question.

187
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,470
He keeps us on some crap
need-to-know deal.

188
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,710
He does what he does
for a reason.

189
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,290
- What reason?
- Our job!

190
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,430
There's no time to argue.
There's no margin for error.

191
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,870
It's just the way the old man
runs things.

192
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,610
Yeah, well, maybe that worked when
we were kids, but not anymore, all right?

193
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,160
Not after everything you and I
have been through, Dean.

194
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,060
Are you telling me you're cool
with just falling into line

195
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,710
and letting him
run the whole show?

196
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,180
If that's what it takes.

197
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,380
Have some beer, buddy.

198
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,520
It'll calm your nerves.

199
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,930
No, thanks.

200
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,755
Oh, come on.

201
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,130
You drink enough,
I can taste it in your blood.

202
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,790
That's gross.

203
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,940
Well, how about you, babe?

204
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,070
Attagirl.

205
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,580
Bo! Wait for Luther.

206
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,740
I missed you, too, baby.

207
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,570
We've got presents.

208
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,560
She looks interesting.

209
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,230
He doesn't.

210
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,655
Lock him up.

211
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,050
Let's go.

212
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,220
On second thought,
go ahead and treat yourself.

213
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,330
No!

214
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,670
There's something else.

215
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,490
- This all theirs?
- No.

216
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,010
It's from an old friend
of yours...

217
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,790
Daniel Elkins.

218
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,860
I caught his scent.

219
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,300
I thought I'd surprise you.

220
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,130
Kate, what did you do?

221
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,870
- I made him suffer.
- You shouldn't have done that.

222
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,160
There are others like him.

223
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,120
They'll know the signs
and come looking for us.

224
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,260
- We have to be careful.
- Luther, I did it for you,

225
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,640
For what he did to your family.

226
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,860
Revenge isn't worth much
if you end up dead.

227
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,530
I'm sorry, babe.

228
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,820
I'm sorry.

229
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,400
I thought you might
like that.

230
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,060
Looks like it was made
around the time you were born.

231
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,310
I've seen this before.

232
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,140
Elkins died with it
in his hands.

233
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,010
He should have known better...

234
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,550
Using a gun!

235
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,070
This is no ordinary gun.

236
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,400
Yeah, dad.
All right, got it.

237
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,600
- Pull off the next exit.
- Why?

238
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,080
'Cause dad thinks we got
the vampires' trail.

239
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,590
How?

240
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,190
I don't know.
He didn't say.

241
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,520
Oh, crap. Here we go.

242
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,470
- Sam, what the hell was that?
- We need to talk.

243
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,320
- About what?
- About everything.

244
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,525
Where we going, dad?

245
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,045
What's the big deal
about this gun?

246
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,410
Sammy, come on. We can q&a after
we kill all the vampires.

247
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,960
Your brother's right.
We don't have time for this.

248
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,260
Last we saw you, you said it was
too dangerous to be together.

249
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,830
Now, out of the blue,
you need our help.

250
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,700
Obviously something big's going down,
and we want to know what!

251
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,230
- Get back in the car.
- No.

252
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,420
I said get back
in the damn car.

253
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,760
Yeah, and I said no.

254
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,390
All right, you made your point,
tough guy.

255
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,450
Look, we're all tired.
We can talk about this later.

256
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,810
Sammy, I mean it.
Come on.

257
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,420
This is why I left
in the first place.

258
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,250
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

259
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Yeah, you left.

260
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,650
Your brother and me...
We needed you.

261
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,110
You walked away, Sam.
You walked away!

262
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,390
- Stop it, both of you!
- You're the one who said, "don't come back", dad.

263
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,700
You're the one who closed
that door, not me!

264
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,390
You were just pissed off
you couldn't control me anymore!

265
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,060
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

266
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,390
That's enough!

267
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,500
That means you, too.

268
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,070
Terrific.

269
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,060
You like to watch, huh?

270
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,490
Me too.

271
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,280
Ready, baby?

272
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,180
Are you gonna kill me?

273
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,110
I'm gonna take you so high
you're never gonna come down.

274
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,770
Welcome home, baby.

275
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,430
I know what time it is.

276
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,490
Get in.

277
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,020
Son of a bitch.

278
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,740
So they're really not
afraid of the sun?

279
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,190
No, direct sunlight hurts
like a nasty sunburn.

280
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,890
The only way to kill them
is by beheading.

281
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,290
And, yeah,
they sleep during the day.

282
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,540
It doesn't mean
they won't wake up.

283
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,320
So I guess walking right in's
not our best option.

284
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,560
Actually...

285
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,540
that's the plan.

286
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,990
Dad, I've got an extra machete
if you need one.

287
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,080
Think I'm okay.
Thanks.

288
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,180
Wow.

289
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,070
So...

290
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,950
You boys really want to know
about this colt?

291
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,360
Yes, sir.

292
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,420
It's just a story...

293
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,150
A legend, really.

294
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,250
Well, I thought it was.

295
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,220
Never really believed it
until I read Daniel's letter.

296
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,970
Back in 1835, when
Halley's comet was overhead,

297
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,810
the same night those men died
at the alamo,

298
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,870
they say Samuel Colt
made a gun...

299
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,400
A special gun.

300
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,450
He made it for a hunter...

301
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,560
A man like us,
only on horseback.

302
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,670
The story goes
he made 13 bullets.

303
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,480
This hunter used the gun
a half dozen times

304
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,520
before he disappeared,
the gun along with him.

305
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,800
Somehow,
Daniel got his hands on it.

306
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,940
They say...

307
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,790
they say this gun
can kill anything.

308
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,130
Kill anything,
like supernatural anything?

309
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,020
Like the demon.

310
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,590
Yeah, the demon.

311
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,610
Ever since I picked up its trail,

312
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,980
I've been looking for a way
to destroy that thing.

313
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,790
Find the gun...

314
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,050
we may have it.

315
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,920
Dean.

316
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,200
There's more.

317
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,600
Hey.

318
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,190
Hey, hey, shh.
I'm here to help you.

319
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,810
Boys, run!

320
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,690
Dad!

321
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,350
Dad?!

322
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,660
Dad?!

323
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,830
They won't follow.
They'll wait till tonight.

324
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,830
Once a vampire gets your scent,
it's for life.

325
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,190
What the hell do we do now?

326
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,370
You got to find
the nearest funeral home.

327
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,530
It shouldn't be taking
this long.

328
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,820
I should go help.

329
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,590
Dean's got it.

330
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,960
Sammy.

331
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,180
Yeah?

332
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,370
I don't think
I ever told you this, but...

333
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,340
the day you were born,
you know what I did?

334
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,420
No.

335
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,470
I put 100 bucks into
a savings account for you.

336
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,100
I did the same thing
for your brother.

337
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,540
It was a college fund.

338
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,490
And every month, I'd put in
another $100 until...

339
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,000
Anyway, my point is, Sam,
that...

340
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,650
This is never the life
that I wanted for you.

341
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,770
Then why'd you get so mad
when I left?

342
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,210
You got to understand
something.

343
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,420
After your mother passed,

344
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,900
all I saw was evil,

345
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,560
everywhere.

346
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,140
And all I cared about
was keeping you boys alive.

347
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,660
I wanted you prepared...

348
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,490
ready.

349
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,940
So somewhere along the line,
I, uh...

350
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,290
I stopped being your father.

351
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,630
And I...

352
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,940
I became your drill sergeant.

353
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,430
So when you said you wanted to
go away to school,

354
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,990
all I could think about,
my only thought was

355
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,830
that you were gonna be alone...

356
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,230
Vulnerable.

357
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,330
Sammy, it just...

358
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,780
It never occurred to me
what you wanted.

359
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,360
I just couldn't accept the fact
that you and me...

360
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,240
we're just different.

361
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,600
What?

362
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,260
We're not different.

363
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,680
Not anymore.

364
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,990
With what happened to
mom and Jess...

365
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,710
We probably have a lot more
in common than just about anyone.

366
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,840
I guess you're right, son.

367
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,530
Hey, dad?

368
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,590
What happened to
that college fund?

369
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,200
Spent it on the ammo.

370
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,360
Whoo!

371
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,770
Man, there's some heavy security
to protect a bunch of dead guys.

372
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,890
Did you get it?

373
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,530
You know what to do.

374
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
Car trouble?

375
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,240
Let me give you a lift...

376
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,440
Take you back to my place.

377
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,280
I'll pass.

378
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,700
I usually draw the line
at necrophilia.

379
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,760
I don't normally get this friendly
till the second date.

380
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,280
You know,
we could have some fun.

381
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,670
I always like
to make new friends.

382
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,450
Oh, sorry.

383
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,480
I never really stay with a chick
that long.

384
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,800
Definitely not eternity.

385
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,320
Damn it.

386
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,420
Barely even stings.

387
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,840
Give it time, sweetheart.

388
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,300
That arrow's soaked
in dead man's blood.

389
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,710
It's like poison to you,
isn't it?

390
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,860
Load her up.

391
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,570
I'll take care of this one.

392
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,680
Toss this on the fire.

393
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,750
Saffron, skunks, cabbage,
and trillium,

394
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,220
it'll block our scent and hers
until we're ready.

395
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,130
- Stuff stinks.
- Well, that's the idea.

396
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,630
Dust your clothes
with the ashes

397
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,690
and you'll stand a chance
of not being detected.

398
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,080
You sure
they'll come after her?

399
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,530
Yeah. Vampires mate for life.

400
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,940
She means more to the leader
than the gun.

401
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,800
But the blood sickness
is gonna wear off soon,

402
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,220
so you don't
have a lot of time.

403
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,670
Half-hour ought to do it.

404
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,350
And then I want you out
of the area as fast as you can.

405
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,880
- But...
- You can't take care of them all yourself.

406
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,190
I'll have her

407
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,030
and the colt.

408
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,250
But after,

409
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,450
we're gonna meet up, right?

410
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,340
Use the gun together,

411
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,210
right?

412
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,920
You're leaving again,
aren't you?

413
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,700
You still want to go after
the demon alone?

414
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,600
You know, I don't get you.

415
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,070
- You can't treat us like this.
- Like what?

416
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,860
- Like children.
- You are my children.

417
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,910
I'm trying to keep you safe.

418
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,640
Dad, all due respect,
but that's a bunch of crap.

419
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,640
Excuse me?

420
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,570
You know what Sammy and I
have been hunting.

421
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,780
Hell, you sent us on
a few hunting trips yourself.

422
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,880
You can't be that worried
about keeping us safe.

423
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,090
It's not the same thing,
Dean.

424
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,460
Then what is it?

425
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,460
Why do you want us
out of the big fight?

426
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,710
This demon...

427
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,760
It's a bad son of a bitch.

428
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,800
I can't make the same moves

429
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,750
if I'm worried
about keeping you alive.

430
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,210
You can't be as reckless.

431
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,320
Look...

432
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:34,050
I don't expect to make it out
of this fight in one piece.

433
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,580
Your mother's death...

434
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,080
It almost killed me.

435
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,790
I can't watch
my children die, too.

436
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,290
I won't.

437
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,480
What happens if you die?

438
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,270
Dad, what happens if you die

439
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,820
and we could have
done something about it?

440
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,700
You know, I've been thinking.

441
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,790
I think maybe Sammy's right
about this one.

442
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,390
We should do this together.

443
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,970
We're stronger as a family, dad.
We just are. You know it.

444
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,240
We're running out of time.

445
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,140
You do your job,
and you get out of the area.

446
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,290
That's an order.

447
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,710
Is there any sign
of those three?

448
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,320
No. Something else.

449
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,530
- What?
- Luther, they cut off Hank's head.

450
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,570
And Kate?

451
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,820
I don't know.
She wasn't there.

452
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,560
What are we gonna do?

453
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,140
It's just a truck
up on the highway.

454
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,280
Kate.

455
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,370
She's in that truck.

456
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,780
Boo.

457
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,940
I told you I'd come back.

458
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,540
Get out!

459
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,640
Who are you?

460
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,110
My name's Winchester.

461
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,520
Where are your friends?

462
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,060
Cleaning out your nest.

463
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,940
Where's Kate?

464
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,030
Come here, sweetheart.

465
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,190
Kate, you all right?

466
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,150
Dead man's blood.

467
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,680
You son of a bitch.

468
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,640
I want the colt...
Elkins' gun.

469
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,240
Trade.

470
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,040
Is that what this
is all about?

471
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,800
I mean, you can't shoot us all,
right?

472
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,220
We'll kill you.

473
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,650
Oh, I don't need it for you.

474
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,400
I'm saving it
for something else.

475
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,440
Now, put the colt down
or she goes first.

476
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,410
All right.

477
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,790
Just don't hurt her.

478
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,130
Back up.

479
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,540
Further.

480
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,390
That's a nice move.
You almost made it.

481
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,260
Don't!
I'll break his neck.

482
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,910
Put the blade down.

483
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,120
You people.

484
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,570
Why can't you
just leave us alone?

485
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,810
We have as much right to live
as you do.

486
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,330
I don't think so.

487
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,740
Luther!

488
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,130
Kate, don't!

489
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,870
So, boys...

490
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,620
Yes, sir?

491
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,080
You ignored a direct order
back there.

492
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,390
- Yes, sir.
- But we saved your ass.

493
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,820
You're right.

494
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,760
I am?

495
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,380
It scares the hell
out of me.

496
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,210
You two are all I've got.

497
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,290
But I guess we are stronger
as a family.

498
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,080
So...

499
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,380
we go after this damn thing...

500
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,430
together.

501
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,470
Yes, sir.
