1
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,770
Okay,
i think i found a way

2
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,690
we can bypass that construction
just east of here.

3
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,720
We might even make pennsylvania
faster than we thought.

4
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,090
Yeah.

5
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,290
Problem is
we're not going to pennsylvania.

6
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,240
Wait... what?

7
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,570
I just got a call
from an old friend.

8
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,480
Her father was killed
last night.

9
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,950
She thinks it might be
our kind of thing.

10
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,100
What?

11
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,470
Yeah, believe me,

12
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,820
she never would've called,
never, if she didn't need us.

13
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,620
Come on.
You coming or what?

14
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,770
By "old friend,"
you mean...

15
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,940
a friend
that's not new.

16
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,120
Yeah, thanks.

17
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,310
So, her name's cassie,
huh?

18
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,970
You never mentioned her.

19
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,950
Didn't i?
No.

20
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,500
Yeah, we went out.
You mean you dated someone?

21
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,660
For more than one night?

22
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,210
Am i speaking a language
you're not getting here?

23
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,610
Dad and i were working
a job in athens, ohio.

24
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,380
She was finishing up college.
We went out for a couple weeks.

25
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,950
And?

26
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,800
Look, it's terrible
about her dad,

27
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,350
but it kind of sounds
like a standard car accident.

28
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,550
I'm not seeing how it fits
with what we do.

29
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,650
Which, by the way,
how does she know what we do?

30
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,800
You told her.
You told her the secret.

31
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,710
Our big family rule
number one...

32
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,910
we do what we do
and we shut up about it.

33
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,430
For a year and a half,
i do nothing but lie to jessica,

34
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,020
and you go out with this chick
in ohio a couple of times

35
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,190
and you tell her
everything?

36
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,180
Dean!

37
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,090
Yeah, looks like.

38
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,440
Anderson: It's a newspaper
we put out here,

39
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,200
not a bulletin
for the mayor's office.

40
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,920
Get off your soapbox,
jimmy.

41
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,090
I'm urging a little discretion
is all.

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,060
No, i think you're telling us
what you want us to print

43
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,910
and what you want us
to sit on.

44
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,630
I know you're upset,
cassie.

45
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,200
I liked your dad a lot.

46
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,450
But i think your grief
is clouding your judgment.

47
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,200
Two black people were killed
on the same stretch of road

48
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,920
in the same way
in three weeks.

49
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,640
Jimmy, you're too close
to this.

50
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,970
Those guys were friends
of yours.

51
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,140
Again, i'm very sorry
for your loss.

52
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,570
Dean.

53
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,100
Hey, cassie.

54
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,110
This is my brother, sam.

55
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,250
I'm sorry about your dad.

56
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,980
Yeah, me, too.

57
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,330
My mother's
in pretty bad shape.

58
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,930
I've been staying with her.

59
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,320
I wish she wouldn't go off
by herself.

60
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,620
She's been snervous
and frightened.

61
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,180
She was worried about dad.

62
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,490
Why?

63
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,480
He was scared.

64
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,980
He was seeing things.

65
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,220
Like what?

66
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,000
He swore he saw an awful-looking
black truck following him.

67
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,300
A truck?
Who was the driver?

68
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,200
He didn't talk about a driver,
just the truck.

69
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,690
He said it would appear
and disappear.

70
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,430
And in the accident,
dad's truck was dented

71
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,430
like it had been slammed into
by something big.

72
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,610
Thanks.

73
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,030
Now, you're sure this dent
wasn't there before?

74
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,010
He sold cars,
always drove a new one.

75
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,020
There wasn't a scratch
on that thing.

76
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,690
It had rained hard that night.
There was mud everywhere.

77
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,220
There was a distinct set
of muddy tracks from dad's car

78
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,160
leading right...

79
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,030
to the edge
where he went over.

80
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,080
One set of tracks... his.

81
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,670
And the first person killed
was a friend of your father's?

82
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,040
Best friend...
clayton solmes.

83
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,700
They owned
a car dealership together.

84
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,430
Same thing...
dent, no tracks.

85
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,780
And the cops said exactly
what they said about dad...

86
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,410
"he lost control
of his car. "

87
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,550
Can you think of why your father
and partner might be targets?

88
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,950
No.

89
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,910
You think this vanishing truck
ran him off the road?

90
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,510
When you say it
aloud like that...

91
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,680
listen, i'm a little skeptical
about this ghost stuff

92
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,120
or whatever it
is you guys are into.

93
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,590
Skeptical.

94
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,000
If i remember,
i think you said i was nuts.

95
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,800
That was then.

96
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,010
Hmm.

97
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,450
I just know that i can't explain
what happened up there,

98
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,080
so i called you.

99
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,220
Mom.
Where have you been?

100
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,140
I had no idea
you'd invited friends over.

101
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,350
Mom, this is dean,
a friend of mine from... college,

102
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,820
and his brother, sam.

103
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,990
Well,
I- I-I-i won't interrupt you.

104
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,210
Mrs. Robinson?
Hmm?

105
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,590
We're sorry for your loss.

106
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,480
We'd like to talk to you for
a minute, if you don't mind.

107
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,690
I'm really not up
to that just now.

108
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,550
Dd: Jimmy meant something
to this town.

109
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,220
He was one of our best.

110
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,660
It won't be the same
without him.

111
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,520
Our best seem to be dropping
like flies.

112
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,320
Clayton, my father, jimmy.

113
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,020
What is it exactly
you want me to do?

114
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,870
Well, how about closing this
section of road for starters?

115
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,990
Close the main road, the only
road in and out of town?

116
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,970
Accidents happen, cassie. That's
what they are... accidents.

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,320
Did the cops check
for denting on jimmy's car

118
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,920
to see if it was pushed?

119
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,080
Who's this?

120
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,930
Dean and sam winchester,
family friends.

121
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,980
This is mayor harold todd.

122
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,070
There's one set of tracks...
one. Doesn't point to foul play.

123
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,310
Mayor, the police
and town officials

124
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,020
take their cues from you...
if you're indifferent about...

125
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,270
indifferent?

126
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,030
Would you close the road
if the victims were white?

127
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,760
You're suggesting
i'm racist, cassie.

128
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,190
I'm the last person
you should talk to like that.

129
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,160
Why is that?

130
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,310
Why don't you k
your mother?

131
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,850
I'll say this for her...
she's fearless.

132
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Mm-hmm.

133
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,280
Bet she kicked your ass
a coupleimes.

134
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,810
What's interesting is you guys
never really look at each other

135
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,900
at the same time.

136
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,280
You look at her
when she's not looking.

137
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,620
She checks you out
when you look away.

138
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,790
It's just a... just an
interesting observation

139
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,290
in a, you know,
observationally interesting way.

140
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,930
You think we might have some
more pressing issues here?

141
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,170
Hey, if i'm hitting
a nerve...

142
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,460
oh, let's go.

143
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,990
Excuse me.
Are you ron stubbins?

144
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,760
Friends with jimmy anderson?

145
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,920
Who are you?

146
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,450
We're with mr. Anderson's
insurance company.

147
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,180
Just here to dot some i's
and cross some t's.

148
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,400
We were just wondering,
had the deceased mentioned

149
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,900
any unusual
recent experiences?

150
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,320
What do you mean,
"unusual"?

151
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,080
Well, visions,
hallucinations.

152
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,910
It's all part of a medical
examination kind of thing.

153
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,930
What company
you say you were with?

154
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,180
All tional mutual.

155
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,650
Tell me, did he ever mention
seeing a truck,

156
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,065
a big black truck?

157
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,380
What the hell you talking about?
You even speaking english?

158
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,690
Son, this truck, a big, scary,
monster-looking thing?

159
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,330
Yeah, actually,
i think so.

160
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,320
Hmm.

161
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,930
What?

162
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,500
I have heard
of a truck like that.

163
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,760
You have?

164
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,750
Where?

165
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,840
Not where... when.

166
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,090
Back in the '60s,
there was a string of deaths.

167
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,400
Black men.

168
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,580
Stores they disappeared
in a big, nasty black truck.

169
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,060
They ever catch
the guy who did it?

170
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,090
Never found him.

171
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,590
Hell, not sure
they even really looked.

172
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,710
See, there was a time

173
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,330
this town wasn't too friendly
to all its citizens.

174
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,640
Thank you.

175
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,230
Truck.

176
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,650
Keeps coming up,
doesn't it?

177
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,830
I was thinking. You heard
of the flying dutchman?

178
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,370
Yeah, a ghost ship infused
with the captain's evil spirit.

179
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,880
It was basically
a part of him.

180
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,970
So, what if we're dealing
with the same thing?

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,670
A phantom truck who's the
extension of some bastard ghost,

182
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,830
re-enacting past crimes.

183
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,630
The victims have
all been black men.

184
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,110
I think it's more
than that.

185
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,810
They all seem connected
to cassie and her family.

186
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,930
All right, well,
you work that angle.

187
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Go talk to her.

188
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,180
Yeah, i will.

189
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,360
Oh, and you might also want
to mention that other thing.

190
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,840
What other thing?

191
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,700
That serious unfinished
business.

192
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,200
Dean, what is going on
between you two?

193
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,580
So maybe we were a little bit
more involved than i said.

194
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,470
Oh, okay, yeah.

195
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,470
Okay, a lot more... maybe.

196
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,490
I told her the secret about what
we do, and i shouldn't have.

197
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,380
Look, man, everybody's got
to open up to someone sometime.

198
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,630
Yeah, i don't.

199
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,780
It was stupid to get that close.
I mean, look how it ended.

200
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,680
Would you stop?

201
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,410
Blink or something.

202
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,950
You loved her.

203
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,070
Oh, god.

204
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,480
You were in love with her,
but you dumped her.

205
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,270
Oh, wow.

206
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,250
She dumped you.

207
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,990
Get in the car.

208
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,040
Get in the car!

209
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,990
Dean.

210
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,500
Hey. Hey.

211
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,590
Come on in.

212
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,110
So, you busy?

213
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,590
The paper is doing
a tribute to jimmy.

214
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:40,450
I was just going
through his stuff, his awards,

215
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,270
trying to find the words.

216
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,970
That's got to be tough.

217
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,320
For years this family owned
the paper, the dorians.

218
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,240
They had a whites-only
staff policy.

219
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,040
After they sold it, jimmy became
the first black reporter.

220
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,800
He became editor.

221
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,890
He taught me everything.

222
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,310
Where's your brother?

223
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,290
Not here.

224
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,420
All right,
so, what brings you here?

225
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,410
I'm trying to find
the connection

226
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,890
between the three victims.

227
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,330
By the way,
did you talk to your mom

228
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,330
about what todd said
about not being a racist?

229
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,480
I did.

230
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,660
She didn't want
to talk about it.

231
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,610
So, just then, why did you ask
where my brother was?

232
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,990
Nothing. Not important.

233
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,920
Could it be because without him
here it'just you and me

234
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,720
and not you, me, and sam,
which would be easier?

235
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,970
It's not easier.

236
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,610
Look...

237
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,250
no, forget it.
It's fine.

238
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,200
Keep it strictly business.

239
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,610
I forgot you do that.

240
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,090
Do what?

241
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,400
Oh, whenever we get...

242
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,590
what's the word, close?...

243
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,290
anywhere in the neighborhood
of emotional vulnerability,

244
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,630
you back off
or make some joke

245
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,600
or find any way
to shut the door on me.

246
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,460
Oh, that's hilarious.

247
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,160
See, i'm not the one
who took that big, final door

248
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,930
and slammed it behind me,
and i'm not the one

249
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,370
who took
the key and buried it.

250
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,050
Are we done
with this metaphor?

251
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,620
All i'm saying is i was totally
up front with you back then

252
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,650
and you nailed me with it.

253
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,540
The guy i'm hoping
might be in my future

254
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,410
tells me he professionally
pops ghosts.

255
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,790
Those weren't
the words i used.

256
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,910
And he has to leave too
work with his father. I did.

257
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,520
All i could think was,
if you want out, fine.

258
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,740
But don't tell me
this insane story.

259
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,120
It was the truth,
cassie,

260
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,530
it didn't sound so insane the
minute you thought i could help.

261
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,560
Back then i thought you just
wanted to dump me.

262
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,260
Whoa, let's not forget
who dumped who, okay?

263
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,380
I thought it was
what you wanted.

264
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,470
Well, it wasn't.

265
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,240
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

266
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,200
Well, you did.

267
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,100
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.

268
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,660
Absolutely.

269
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,580
Actually, we were always
pretty good at fighting.

270
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,990
This, we were good at.

271
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,200
It's all the other stuff,
not so much.

272
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,870
Hey, i tried.

273
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,790
I told you who i really was.
It was a big first for me.

274
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,910
Why'd you tell me?

275
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,260
I don't know.

276
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,360
I guess
i couldn't lie to you.

277
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,050
Dean...

278
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,490
when you told me
that story,

279
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,230
it scared the hell
out of me.

280
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,440
I thought you were nuts,
dangerous even.

281
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,940
Actually...

282
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,120
maybe i was looking
for a reason to walk away.

283
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:28,640
In my work
i see some horrible things,

284
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,310
things that
can't be explained.

285
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,690
I deal with them.

286
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,230
But working things out
with you?

287
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,800
I'm a scary one,
all right.

288
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,310
Hmm.

289
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,300
Well, usually thgs
get worked out

290
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,000
when you really
want them to.

291
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,360
Yeah, but i'm still really
involved in my dad's work.

292
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:07,780
No more excuses, okay?
From you or me.

293
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,970
Okay.

294
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,310
Yeah

295
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,330
you're kidding.

296
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,860
And he's with me.

297
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,970
Where were you
last night?

298
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,900
You didn't make it back
to the motel.

299
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,990
Nope.

300
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,890
I'm guessing you guys
worked things out.

301
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,850
We'll be working things out
when we're 90.

302
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,100
So, what happened?

303
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,350
Every bone crushed, internal
organs turned to pudding.

304
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,540
The cops are all stumped,

305
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,370
but it's almost like
something ran him over.

306
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,880
Something like a truck?
Yep.

307
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,900
Tracks?
Nope.

308
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,930
What was the mayor
doing here anyway?

309
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,300
He owned the property.
Bought it a few weeks ago.

310
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,390
Yeah, but he's white.
Doesn't fit the pattern.

311
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,190
Killings didn't happen up
on the road.

312
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,990
That doesn't fit, either.

313
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,930
Thanks.

314
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,210
I'm trying to find some link
between those killings

315
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,950
in the '60s
and what's going on now.

316
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,840
There wasn't a lot about it
in the paper.

317
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,610
Not surprising. Probably
minimal-police-work deal.

318
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,850
Back then,
equal justice under the law

319
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,720
wasn't too literal
around here.

320
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,805
Yeah?

321
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,310
Sam:
Okay, the courthouse records

322
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,370
show that mr. And mrs. Mayor
bought an abandoned property.

323
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,300
The previous owner
was the dorian family,

324
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,680
for like 150 years.

325
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,970
Dorian?
Yeah.

326
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,310
Didn't you say the dorian family
used to own this paper?

327
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,240
Along with most everything else
around here.

328
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,330
Real pillars of the town.

329
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,590
Right, right.

330
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,410
That's interesting.

331
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,310
What?

332
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,300
This cyrus dorian,
he vanished in april of '63.

333
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,190
The case was investigated
but never solved.

334
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,480
It was the time the string
of murders was going on.

335
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,120
Well, i pulled a bunch of paper
up on the dorian place.

336
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,760
It must've been in bad shape
when the mayor bought it.

337
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,230
Why is that?

338
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,870
The first thing he did
was bulldoze the place.

339
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,480
Mayor todd knocked down
the dorianlace?

340
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,050
It was a big deal. One of
the oldest local houses left.

341
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,590
It made the front page.

342
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,720
You got a date?

343
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,900
Uh... the 3rd
of last month.

344
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,290
Mayor todd bulldozed the
dorian family home on the 3rd.

345
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,090
The first killing
was the very next day.

346
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,050
Dean!

347
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,110
Maybe you could throw
a couple shots in that.

348
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,610
You didn't see
who was driving the truck?

349
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,310
It seemed to be no one.

350
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,230
Everything was moving
so fast.

351
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:17,980
And then it was just gone.
Why didn't it kill us?

352
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,550
Whatever is controlling the
truck wants you afraid first.

353
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,570
Mrs. Robinson, cassie said
that your husband saw the truck

354
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,140
before he died.

355
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,430
Mom?

356
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,880
Hmm?

357
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,570
Martin was under
a lot of stress.

358
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,500
You can't be sure
about what he was seeing.

359
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,820
Well, after tonight i think
we can be reasonably sure

360
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,170
that he was seeing
a truck.

361
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,310
What happened tonight,
you and cassie are marked, okay?

362
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,590
Your daughter could die,
so if you know something,

363
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,490
now would be a really good time
to tell us about it.

364
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,320
Dean...
yes.

365
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,930
Yes, he said
he saw a truck.

366
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,080
Did he know
who it belonged to?

367
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,330
He thought he did.
Who was that?

368
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,190
Cyrus...

369
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,180
a man named cyrus.

370
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,710
Is this cyrus?

371
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,140
Cyrus dorian died
more than 40 years ago.

372
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,290
How do you know he died,
mrs. Robinson?

373
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,050
The paper said
he went missing.

374
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,330
How do you know
he died?

375
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,870
We were all very young.

376
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,560
I dated cyrus a while.

377
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,550
I was also seeing martin,
in secret of course

378
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:45,600
'cause interracial couples
didn't go over too well then.

379
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,040
When i broke it off
with cyrus,

380
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,870
and when he found out
about martin...

381
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:56,180
i don't know...
he changed.

382
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:01,800
His hatred...
his hatred was frightening.

383
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,250
The string of murders.

384
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,350
There were rumors,

385
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,110
people of color disappearing
into some kind oa truck.

386
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,980
Nothing was ever done.

387
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,900
Martin and...

388
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,970
martin and i,
we were gonna be married

389
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,920
in that little church near here,

390
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,740
but last minute,
we decided to elope

391
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,990
'cause we didn't want
all the attention.

392
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,210
And cyrus?

393
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,780
The day we set for the wedding

394
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:54,140
was the day
someone set fire to the church.

395
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,930
There was a children's choir
practicing in there.

396
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,320
They all died.

397
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,130
Did the attacks stop
after that?

398
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,980
No, there was one more.

399
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,520
One night that truck came
for martin.

400
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,270
Cyrus beat him
something terrible,

401
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,870
but martin...
you see, martin got loose

402
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,620
and he started hitting cyrus

403
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,700
and he just kept hitting him
and hitting him.

404
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,780
Why didn't you call
the cops?

405
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,030
This was 40 years ago.

406
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,520
He called on his friends...

407
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,410
clayton, solmes,
and jimmy anderson...

408
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,650
and they put cyrus' body
into the truck

409
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,080
and then rolled it into the
swamp at the edge of his land

410
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:25,360
and all three of them kept
that secret all these years.

411
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,700
And now all three are gone.

412
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,790
So is mayor todd.

413
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,660
Now, he said
that you of all people

414
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,420
would know
that he is not a racist.

415
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,450
Why would he say that?

416
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,440
He was a good man.

417
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,620
He was a young deputy
back then,

418
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,320
investigating
cyrus's disappearance.

419
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,830
Once he figured out what martin
and the others had done,

420
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,440
he he did nothing

421
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,000
because he also knew
what cyrus had done.

422
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,610
Why didn't you tell me?

423
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,210
I thought
i was protecting them.

424
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,110
And now there's no one
left to protect.

425
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,450
Yes, there is.

426
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,390
Oh, my life was so simple.

427
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,720
Just school, exams,

428
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,110
papers on polycentric
cultural norms.

429
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,900
So i guess i saved you
from a boring existence.

430
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,010
Occasionally i miss boring.

431
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,220
So, this killer truck...

432
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,970
i miss conversations that didn't
start with "this killer truck. "

433
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,350
Ah...

434
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,240
all right, well,
this cyrus guy,

435
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,800
evil on a level
that infected even his truck.

436
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,200
When he died,
the swamp became his tomb

437
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,480
and his spirit was dormant
for 40 years.

438
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,660
So, what woke it up?

439
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,170
The construction on his house
or the destructi.

440
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,260
Right.

441
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,950
Demolition or remodeling
can awaken spirits,

442
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,620
make them restless.

443
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,920
Like that theater
in illinois.

444
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,140
Yeah.

445
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,100
And the guy who tears down
the family homestead,

446
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,540
harold todd,
is the same guy

447
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,970
that kept cyrus's murder quiet
and unsolved.

448
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,090
So now his spirit is awakened
and out for blood.

449
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,300
I guess. Who knows what ghosts
are thinking anyway.

450
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,570
You know we're gonna have to
dredge that body from the swamp?

451
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,140
Maman.

452
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,410
You said it.
Yeah.

453
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,340
Hey.

454
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,330
She's asleep.

455
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,350
Now what?

456
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,290
And we'll be back.
Don't leave the house.

457
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,450
Don't go getting
all authoritative on me.

458
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,510
I hate it.

459
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,540
Don't leave
the house, please?

460
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,750
You coming or what?

461
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,680
Sam: All right,
let's get her up.

462
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,320
All right.
Little more.

463
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,540
Little more.

464
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,890
Litt more.

465
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,120
All right, stop.

466
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,560
Nice.

467
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,590
Hell yeah.

468
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,940
Now i know
what she sees in you.

469
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,170
What?

470
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,650
Come on, you can admit it.
You're still in love with her.

471
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,910
Can we focus, please?

472
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,710
I'm just saying, dean.

473
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,710
Hold that.

474
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,260
All right.
What am i getting?

475
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,800
Gas, flashlight.
Got it, got it.

476
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,280
All right,
let's get this done.

477
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,480
All right.
Got it.

478
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,680
All right,
let's get to it.

479
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,250
Think that'll do it?

480
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,790
I guess not.

481
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,130
So burning the body
had no effect on that thing?

482
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,450
Sure it did.
Now it's really pissed.

483
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,350
But cyrus's ghost
is gone, right, dean?

484
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,090
Apparently not the part
that's fused with the truck.

485
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,100
Where you going?

486
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,420
Going for a little ride.
Gonna lead that thing away.

487
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,190
That rusted piece of crap,
you got to burn it.

488
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,770
How the hell am i supposed
to burn a truck, dean?

489
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,570
I don't know.
Figure something out.

490
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,510
Figure something...

491
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,180
Hey, you got to give me
a minute.

492
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,660
I don't have a minute!
What are we doing?!

493
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,560
Uh... let me get back
to you.

494
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,430
Hey, cassie?
Hey, it's sam.

495
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,390
Okay, i need some information
and it has to be exactly right.

496
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,200
All right, dean.
This better be good!

497
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,710
Where are you? I'm in the middle of
nowhere with a killer truck on my ass!

498
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,870
It's like it knows
i put the torch to cyrus!

499
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,510
Dean, listen to me.
It's important.

500
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,570
I have to know exactly
where you are.

501
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,930
Decatur road,
about two miles off the highway.

502
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,670
Okay, headed east?
Yes!

503
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,530
Oh, you son of a bitch.

504
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,750
Okay, uh, turn right.

505
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,680
You make the turn?

506
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,070
Yeah, i made the turn!

507
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,780
Move this thing along
a little faster!

508
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,320
All right,
you see a road up ahead?

509
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,510
No!

510
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,220
Wait, yes, i see it!

511
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,800
Okay, turn left.
What?!

512
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,570
All right, now what?

513
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,500
Go exactly 7/10ths of a mile
and stop.

514
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,110
Stop?
Exactly 7/10ths, dean.

515
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,430
7/10ths, 7/10ths.

516
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,660
Dean,
are you still there?

517
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,300
Yeah.
What's happening?

518
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,230
It's just staring at me.
What do i do?

519
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,550
Just what you are doing...
bringing it to you.

520
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,620
Wh...

521
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,600
Come on, come on.

522
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,550
Dean?

523
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,740
You still there?

524
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,510
Dean?

525
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,860
Where'd it go?

526
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,990
Dean,
you're where the church was.

527
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,210
What church?

528
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,630
The place cyrus burned down
and murdered all those kids.

529
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,210
There's not
a whole lot left.

530
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,880
Church ground
is hallowed ground

531
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,370
whether the church
is still there or not.

532
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,360
Evil spirits cross over
hallowed ground,

533
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,070
sometimes they're destroyed.

534
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:26,840
So i figured
maybe that would get rid of it.

535
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,840
Maybe?

536
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,130
Maybe?!

537
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,770
What if you were wrong?!

538
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,090
Honestly, that thought hadn't
occurred to me.

539
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,380
"Well, that honestly
didn't occur to me. "

540
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,790
I'm gonna kill him.

541
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,470
my mother says
to tell you thanks again.

542
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,050
This was a better goodbye
than the last time.

543
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,950
Yeah, well,
maybe this time

544
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,170
it'll be
a little less permanent.

545
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,650
You know what?

546
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,580
I'm a realist.

547
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,450
I don't see much hope
for us, dean.

548
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,770
Well, i've seen
stranger things happen.

549
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,410
Hell of a lot stranger.

550
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,730
Goodbye, dean.

551
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,630
I'll see you, cassie.

552
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,500
I will.

553
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,350
I like her.

554
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,670
Yeah.

555
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,630
You meet someone like her,

556
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,370
ever make you wonder
if it's worth it...

557
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,370
putting everything else on hold,
doing what we do?

558
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,510
Why don't you wake me up
when it's my turn to drive?
