1
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,390
- Come on man, it's not much further.
- I'm cold.

2
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:45,900
It should be just up here.

3
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,400
- Whoa.
- Here we go.

4
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,570
How did you find this place anyway,
Thursten?

5
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,910
My cousin told me about it.

6
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,780
Oh, I am so not going in there.

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,070
Oh... what's this...

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,900
We came all the way out here,
we might as well check it out.

9
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,150
So, let's just hurry this up
and get back to the car, all right?

10
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:11,880
It's freaking cold out here.

11
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,740
You want me to hold your hand?

12
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,810
Are there... any other parts I can hold?

13
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,130
- Shut up you loser!
- Oh come on!

14
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,750
What?

15
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,085
No way.

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,970
Look at all this stuff.

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,420
Come on. It's this way.

18
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,960
They say that it lives in the root cellar.

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,000
Goes after girls,

20
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,360
always girls.

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,920
It just... strings them up.

22
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,230
They say?

23
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,960
Who's they?

24
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,700
- Where did you hear this crap?
- I told you, my cousin.

25
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,170
And where did she hear it?

26
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,190
I don't know, she just heard it.

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,180
Whatever. Give me that thing.

28
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,920
Whoo... look.

29
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,900
It's the evil root cellar.

30
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,800
Where Satan kept all his vegetables.

31
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,750
Why don't you get your candy asses down here
and see for yourselves?

32
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,720
Just a basement full of skunk fill jars,
in some crap farmer house.

33
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,940
I don't see anything scary.

34
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,320
Do you?

35
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,740
What?

36
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,460
What? What is it?

37
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,700
"Fire of Unknown Origin",
by Blue Oyster Cult

38
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,260
Swept to ruin off my wavelength,

39
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,620
swallowed her up

40
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,910
Like the ocean in a fire,

41
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:50,890
so thick and gray.

42
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,270
A fire of unknown origin

43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,450
took my baby away.

44
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,160
Ah ah ah... very funny.

45
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,630
Sorry.

46
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,900
Not a lot of scenery here in East Texas.
Kind of gotta make your own.

47
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,120
Man, we're not kids anymore, Dean.

48
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,770
- We're not gonna start that crap up again.
- Start what up?

49
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,900
That prank stuff, it's stupid.

50
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:24,075
And always escalates.

51
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,740
What's the matter, Sammy? You afraid you
gonna get a little Nair in your shampoo again, huh?

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,925
Alright.

53
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,940
- Just remember you started it.
- Oh, oh bring it on baldy.

54
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,530
Where are we, anyway?

55
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,570
Two hours out of Richardson.

56
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,670
Give me the load out again.

57
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,800
Alright, about two months ago,

58
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,420
this group of kids go poking around
this local haunted house.

59
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,560
Haunted by what?

60
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,400
Apparently, a pretty misogynist,
a spirit legend goes.

61
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,160
It takes girls and string them up
in the rafters.

62
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,780
Anyway this group of kids see this dead girl
hanging up in the cellar.

63
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,985
Anybody ided the corpse?

64
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,840
Well that's the thing,
by the time the cops got there,

65
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:02,975
the body was gone.

66
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,140
So cops are saying the kids were just
yanking chains.

67
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,550
Maybe the cops were right.

68
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,940
Maybe, but I read a couple of the kids'
first handed accounts.

69
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,520
They seem pretty sincere.

70
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,400
Where did you read these accounts?

71
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,320
Well, I knew we're gonna pass
through Texas so...

72
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,330
last night, I surfed some local...

73
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,320
paranormal websites and I found one.

74
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:24,820
And what's it called?

75
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,310
hellhoundslair. com

76
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,920
Let me guess, streaming live
out of mum's basement.

77
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,475
- Yeah, probably.
- Yeah.

78
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,880
Most of those websites wouldn't know a ghost
if it bit them in the pursqueeter/perskwiter.

79
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,930
Look,

80
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,640
we let dad take off,
which was a mistake by the way

81
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,155
and now we don't know where the hell he is.

82
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,250
So, meantime, we've got to find
ourselves something to hunt.

83
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,860
There's no harm checking this thing out.

84
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,980
Alright, so where do we find these kids?

85
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,770
Same place you always find kids
in a town like this.

86
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,430
It was the scariest thing I ever saw
in my life. I swear to god.

87
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:07,835
From the moment we walked in,

88
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,805
- the walls were painted black
- red,

89
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,975
- I think it was blood.
- Saw these freaky symbols.

90
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,110
- crosses and stars and -
pentagons, - pentecostals.

91
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,810
Whatever, I had my eyes closed
the whole time.

92
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,670
But I can damn sure tell you this much,
no matter what anybody else says,

93
00:06:20,705 --> 00:06:23,337
- that poor girl -
with the black - blond

94
00:06:23,372 --> 00:06:25,970
- red hair, just hanging there,
- kicking,

95
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:28,490
- wasn't even moving.
- She was real.

96
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:30,510
- It's 100%.
- And kind a hot.

97
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,000
- Well you know in a dead sort of way.
- Okay.

98
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,390
And how did you find out
about this place anyway?

99
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,780
Craig took us.

100
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,830
Gentlemen, can I help you with anything?

101
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,850
Yeah, are you Craig Thursten?

102
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,205
I am.

103
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,730
Oh, we're reporters of the Dallas Morning News.
I'm Dean, this is Sam.

104
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:59,100
No way.

105
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,340
Yeah, I'm, I'm a writer too.

106
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,560
I write for my school's lip magazine.

107
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:06,190
Uh, good for you, Morrison.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,760
We're doing an article on local hauntings and
rumor has it, you might know about one.

109
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,220
- You mean the hell house?
- That's the one.

110
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,390
I don't think there was anything historic.

111
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,230
Why don't you tell us the story?

112
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,200
Well, supposedly back in the 30's,

113
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,140
this farmer, called Mordecai Murdoch,
used to live in the house with his six daughters.

114
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,350
It was during the Depression.

115
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,730
His crops were failing.

116
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,000
He didn't have enough money,
to feed his own children.

117
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,760
So I guess that's when
he went up to deep end.

118
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,980
How?

119
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,250
Well, he figured
it was best if his girls died quick,

120
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,570
rather than starve to death.

121
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,410
So he attacked them.

122
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,470
They screamed,

123
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,400
begged for him to stop but...

124
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,200
he just strung them up,

125
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,650
one after another.

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,550
And then when it was all finished he

127
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,060
turned around and hung himself.

128
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,670
Now they say that the spirit is trapped
in the house for ever;

129
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,180
stringing up any other girl
that goes inside.

130
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,480
Where did you hear all this?

131
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,320
My cousin Dana told me.

132
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,240
I don't know where she heard it from.

133
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,570
You got to realize, I didn't believe this
for a second.

134
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,700
But now you do.

135
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,480
I don't know what the hell this thing is, man.

136
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,650
Guys, I told you exactly
what I told the police, ok.

137
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,590
That girl was real

138
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,730
and she was dead. This was not a prank.

139
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,030
I swear I don't wanna go anywhere
near this house ever again, ok?

140
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,970
Thanks.

141
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,290
I can't say I blame the kid.

142
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:53,230
Yeah, so much for covert pill.

143
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,120
You got something?

144
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,840
Yeah the EMF is not good.

145
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,700
Why?

146
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,990
I think it got a little juice
in it, screwing with all the readings.

147
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,630
- Yeah, that'll do it.
- Yeah.

148
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,470
Come on, let's go.

149
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,000
It looks like old man Murdoch was a bit of
a tagger during his time.

150
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,760
And after his time, too.

151
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:59,510
The reverse cross has been used by satanists for centuries,
but the sigil of sulphur didn't show up in San Francisco until the '60's.

152
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,320
Exactly why you never get laid.

153
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,910
And what about this one,
you've seen this one before?

154
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,530
No.

155
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,750
I have.

156
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,010
Somewhere.

157
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,920
It's paint.

158
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,590
It seems pretty fresh too.

159
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,220
I don't know, Sam.

160
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,170
I know you agree to the authority figures of
any kind but...

161
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:42,970
The cops might be right about this one.

162
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,790
Yeah, maybe.

163
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,860
Oh god.

164
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,420
Just a couple of humans.

165
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,150
- What are you guys doing here?
- What the hell are you doing here?

166
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,790
Uh uh we belong here we're professionnals.

167
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,120
- Professionnals of what?
- Paranormal investigators...

168
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,800
There you go, and take a look at that boys.

169
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,780
Oh you're gotta be kidding me!

170
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,565
- Ed Zeddmore and Harry Spangler.
- Yeah.

171
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,040
- hellhoundslair. dom, you guys run that website.
- Yeah.

172
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,895
Yeah, yeah. We're huge fans.

173
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,250
And we know who you guys are too.

174
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,740
Oh yeah?

175
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,210
Amators,

176
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,600
looking for ghosts and cheap thrills.

177
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,495
Yeah...

178
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,910
so if you guys don't mind, we're trying to
conduct a serious scientific investigation here.

179
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,560
Yeah, what do you got so far?

180
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,630
Harry, why don't you tell him about EMF?

181
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,020
- Well...
- EMF?

182
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,130
Electro Magnetic Field?

183
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,340
Spectral entities can cause energy fluctuations
that can be read with an EMF detector.

184
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,840
Like this baby right here.

185
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,500
- Whoa, whoa. That's two point eight MJ.
- It's hot in here.

186
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:13,430
Whoa!

187
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,450
So you guys ever have seen a ghost
before or...

188
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,520
Once.

189
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,000
We were...

190
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,850
we were investigating this old house

191
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,130
- and we saw a vase falling off the table.
- By itself.

192
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,770
Well, we-we-we didn't actually see it,
but we heard it.

193
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,620
And something like that, it...

194
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,340
it changes you.

195
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,840
Yeah.

196
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,700
I think I get the picture.

197
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,910
We should go, let them get back to work.

198
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,110
- Yeah, you should.
- Sam.

199
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,530
Work.

200
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,750
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,280
That pot we smoke gave me the giggles.

202
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,675
Hey.

203
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,010
Hey, what do you got?

204
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,290
Well, I couldn't find a Mordecai,
but I did turn up a Mort Murdoch,

205
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,290
that lived in that house in the 30's.

206
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,170
He did have children but only two of them,

207
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,280
both boys.

208
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,970
And there is no record
he ever killed anyone.

209
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,630
What about you?

210
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,760
Huh! Those kids didn't really give us a clear description of
that dead girl but I did head up the police station.

211
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,790
No matching missing persons.
It's like she never existed.

212
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,245
Dude, come on, man, we got our dig in
and this one's a bust.

213
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,870
Alright for all we know those hellhound boys
made up the whole thing.

214
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,260
I say we find ourselves a bar and some beers
and leave the legend to the locals.

215
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,430
What the...

216
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,590
That's all you've got?

217
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,090
That's weak.

218
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,250
That's bush-league.

219
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,720
This is it.

220
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,105
The point of no return.

221
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,220
- Why do I have to go in there?
- Because Jill, you choose dare instead of truth.

222
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,140
Which means you either have to grab a jar
from Mordecai's cellar and bring it back.

223
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,180
Or...

224
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,210
Or you can make out with me...

225
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,840
I'll take the homicidal ghost, thanks.

226
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,860
- Would you ever take that dare?
- Hell, no!

227
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,060
Hello?

228
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,160
Hello?

229
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,180
Is anybody there?

230
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,120
Ok.

231
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,770
Ok, ok, ok.

232
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,430
Aahhhhhhh...

233
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,040
A couple of cops said that a poor girl
hung herself in the house.

234
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,660
- Suicide?
- Yeah.

235
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,030
But she was a straight student.
With a full ride to UT too.

236
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,650
It just doesn't make sense.

237
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,230
What do you think?

238
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,070
That maybe we missed something.

239
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,210
I guess the cops don't wanna anymore kids
screwing around in there.

240
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,650
Remember we still gotta get in there.

241
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,220
I don't believe it.

242
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,210
I got an idea.

243
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,360
Who you're gonna call?

244
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,940
Hey you!

245
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,150
Run!

246
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,870
- Get back here!
- Come on, come on!

247
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,130
Man, I've seen that symbol before,
it's killing me.

248
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,700
Come on, we don't have much time.

249
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,040
Hey, Sam, I dare you to take a swig of this.

250
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,020
What the hell would I do that for?

251
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,270
I double dare you.

252
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,985
I hate rats.

253
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,790
- You rather it was a ghost?
- Yes.

254
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,510
What the hell kind of spirit is immune
to rock salt?!?

255
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:01,760
I dont know.

256
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,520
Come on, come on, come on!

257
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,770
Go! Get out of here!

258
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,600
- Maybe we should just go.
- No, would John Edward go? No.

259
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,490
We've lost the cops. Let's find our center,

260
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,570
and get some work done, ok?

261
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,730
Alright.

262
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,250
- Get that damn thing out of my face!
- Go go go out of here!

263
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,170
Sweet Lord of the Rings...

264
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,530
Run!

265
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,710
- Go go go!
- Wait!

266
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,650
It's in the...

267
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,230
- Where did it go?
- Boys, come on.

268
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,780
No, it is...

269
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,360
What the hell is this symbol?
It's bugging the hell out of me.

270
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,690
This whole damn job's bugging me.

271
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,360
I thought the legend said Mordecai
only went after chicks.

272
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,875
It does.

273
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,770
Well, that explains why it went
after you, but why me?

274
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,370
Hilarious.

275
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,340
The legend also says that he hung himself,
but you see those slit wrists?

276
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,995
Yeah.

277
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,080
What's up with that?

278
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,860
And the axe too.

279
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,220
I mean, ghosts are usually pretty stricts, right?
Following the same patterns over and over...

280
00:21:41,255 --> 00:21:43,480
- But his moods keep changing.
- Exactly.

281
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,290
I'm telling you. Where the story goes...

282
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,720
Wait a minute.

283
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,120
What?

284
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,170
Someone added a post
on hellhound site, listen to this.

285
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:59,380
They say: "Murdocai Murdock was really a satanist
who chopped up his victims with an axe"

286
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:01,120
"before slitting his own wrists".

287
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,610
"Now he's emprisoned in the house
for eternity".

288
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,460
What's the hell is this going?

289
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,290
I don't know but I think I might just
figured out where all started.

290
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,650
Hey Craig.

291
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,160
Remember us?

292
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,860
Guys, I'm really not in the mood to answer
anymore of your questions, ok?

293
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,590
Oh don't worry, don't worry, we're just here
to buy an album, that's all.

294
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,520
You know, I couldn't figure out what that symbol was
and then... and then I realized that

295
00:22:55,555 --> 00:22:56,900
it doesn't mean anything.

296
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,390
It's a logo from Blue Oyster Cult.

297
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,700
So tell me Craig, you're into BOC,

298
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,520
or just scaring the hell out of people.

299
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,830
Why don't you tell us about that house...

300
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,430
without lying through your ass this time.

301
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,630
Alright, hum...

302
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,195
My cousin Dana was on break from TCU.

303
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,600
I guess we were just bored, looking for
something to do so I

304
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,270
showed her this abandonned dump I found.

305
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,460
We thought that it'd be funny if it

306
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,170
may look like it was haunted.

307
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,150
So we painted symbols on the walls,
some from some albums,

308
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:42,240
some from some of Dana's theology
text books.

309
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,230
Then we found out that this guy Murdock
used to live there so we...

310
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,090
we made up some story to go along
with that so...

311
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,130
They told people who told other people.

312
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,430
And then these two guys put it on
their stupid website.

313
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,650
Everything just...

314
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,650
took on a life its own.

315
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,870
I mean I thought it was funny
at first but...

316
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,820
Another girl's dead?

317
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,450
It was just a joke.

318
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,650
You know, I mean,

319
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,140
none of this was real,
we made the whole thing up.

320
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,980
I swear.

321
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,030
Alright.

322
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,480
If none of this was real,
how the hell do you explain Mordecai.

323
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,050
Hey, I'm back.

324
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,810
Hey, where were you?

325
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,640
Oh, I went out.

326
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,120
So, I think I might have a theory
about what's going on.

327
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,420
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, what if Mordecai is a tulpa.

328
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,600
A tulpa?

329
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,810
Yeah, uh... that's tibetan thought form.

330
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,310
Yeah, I know, I know what a tulpa is.

331
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,110
Why don't you get dressed?

332
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,560
I'm gonna grap something to eat.

333
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,320
Thank you.

334
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,470
Hey, what's your problem?

335
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,050
- Nothing, I'm
fine. - Yeah. - Yeah.

336
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,050
Alright so keep going.
What about these tulpas.

337
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,870
Ok uh... so there was an incident
in Tibet in 1915.

338
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,410
A group of monks visualized a golem in their heads.
They meditate on it so hard,

339
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,930
they bring the thing to life.

340
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,190
- Out of thin air.
- So...

341
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,880
That was 20 monks.

342
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,510
Imagine what 10 thousand web surfers can do.

343
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,410
I mean Craig starts up a story about
Mordecai, then it spreads,

344
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,720
goes on line, now there's countless
people, all believing in the bastard.

345
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,170
Ok wait a sec. You're trying to tell me that
just because people believe in Mordecai,

346
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,370
he's real?

347
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,850
Don't know, maybe.

348
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,910
People believe in Santa Claus.
Why aren't I getting hooked up every Christmas?

349
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:05,210
'Cause you're a bad person.

350
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,170
And cause of this.

351
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,990
That's a Tibetan spirit sigil,

352
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,940
on the wall of the house.

353
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,410
Craig said they were painting symbols from a theology text book.
I bet you they painteed this without knowing what it was.

354
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,960
Now that sigil has been used for centuries,

355
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,620
concentrating meditative thoughts
like a magnifying glass.

356
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,810
So people on the hellhound website,

357
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,420
staring at the symbol,
thinking about Mordecai...

358
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,300
I mean, I don't know,

359
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,130
but it might be enough to bring a tulpa to life.

360
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,450
It would explain why it keeps changing.

361
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,690
Right. As the legend changes,
people think different things.

362
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,870
So Mordecai himself changes like a
game or a telephone.

363
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,340
That would also explain why the rock salt
didn't work.

364
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,350
Yeah, cause he is not a traditionnal spirit
per say.

365
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,420
- Yeah.
- Ok, so why don't we just...

366
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,150
lock up the spirit sidereal thingy off the wall
and off the website?

367
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,710
Well, it's not that simple.
You see once tulpas are created they...

368
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,300
take on the life of their own.

369
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,850
Great. All right, so if he really is
a thought form,

370
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:00,720
how the hell are we supposed
to kill an idea?

371
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,890
Oh it's not gonna be easy,
and these guys aren't helping us.

372
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,680
Check out their home page.

373
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,940
Since they posted the video
the number of hits quadrupled

374
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,550
in the last day alone.

375
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,420
I have an idea. Come on.

376
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,000
Where are we going?

377
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,670
We need to find a copy store.

378
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,020
Man, I think I'm allergic to our soap
or something.

379
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,700
You did this?

380
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,300
- You're a freaking jerk!
- Oh yeah!

381
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,360
No, no, no.

382
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,450
No, forget it, forget it.
I'm not going back in there again.

383
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:51,840
Harry, look at me, right here, ok.

384
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,790
You are a ghost hunter, okay?

385
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,450
I know but Ed, I've never actually seen a real ghost before.
Like a real ghost, like an apparition...

386
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,870
This stuff right here, this is our ticket
to the big time...

387
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,570
fame,

388
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,390
money,

389
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
sex...

390
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,760
with girls, okay? Be brave,

391
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,860
okay? WWBD.

392
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,790
What would Buffy do, huh?

393
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,530
What would Buffy do.

394
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,090
I know, Ed, but she's stronger than me.

395
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:18,880
It's okay.

396
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,345
Who is it?

397
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,470
Come out you guys, we hear you in there.

398
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,740
It's them.

399
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,250
Look at that.

400
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,420
Action figures
in their original packaging, what a shock.

401
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:34,770
Guys, we need to talk.

402
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,380
Yeah, uh... sorry guys we're uh...
Ouais... d?sol? les gars, on est...

403
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,550
we're a little busy right now.

404
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,310
Ok well we'll make it quick.
We need just to shut down your website.

405
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,820
Man, these guys get us busted last night.
We spend the night in a holding cell.

406
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,800
I had to pee in the cell, you know,
in front of people and I get stage fright.

407
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,080
- Why should we trust you guys?
- Look guys,

408
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,590
we all know what we saw all last night,
what's in the house.

409
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,805
But now thanks to your website, there are
thousands of people hearing about Mordecai.

410
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,310
That's right, which means people are gonna keep showing up at the Hell House,
running into him in persons. Somebody could get hurt.

411
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:04,650
- Yeah.
- Ed, maybe he's got a point.

412
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,645
- No, no
- No.

413
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,880
Ok, we have an obligation to our fans,

414
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:09,600
to the truth.

415
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,070
Well, I have an obligation to kick
both of your asses right now.

416
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,180
Dean, Dean, hey.. just...

417
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,000
forget it, alright, these guys...

418
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,870
probably bitch slapped them both. I could
probably tell them that thing about Mordecai.

419
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,530
But they're still not gonna help us.

420
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,580
- So let's just go.
- You know, you're right.

421
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,900
- No, wait.
- What did you say about...

422
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,360
Hold a second here.

423
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,540
- Yeah.
- What's the thing about Mordecai, you guys?

424
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,440
Tell them, Sam.

425
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,180
But if they agree to shut
their website down, Dean.

426
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,925
But they're not gonna do it,
you said so yourself.

427
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,210
No, wait, wait. Don't listen to him, okay?
We'll do it.

428
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,370
We'll do it.

429
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,090
It's a secret, Sam.

430
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,020
Look, it's pretty big deal, alright?

431
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,530
And it wasn't easy to dig up.

432
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,160
So, only if we have your word that
you'll shut eveything down.

433
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,170
Totally.

434
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,070
Alright.

435
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,430
It's a death certificate,

436
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,720
from the 30's,

437
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,400
we got it at the library.

438
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,850
Now, according to the coroner,
the actual cause of death

439
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,650
- was a self inflicted gun shot wound.
- He's right. He didn't hang or cut himself.

440
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,815
He shot himself?

441
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,650
Yep, with a 45 pistol.

442
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,790
To this day they say he's terrified of them.

443
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,460
As a matter of fact they say if you shoot him with
a 45 loaded with these special rock iron rounds,

444
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,250
you'll kill this son of a bitch.

445
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,950
Harry, slow your all, buddy.
They're gonna know we're excited.

446
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,530
If you pull that string one more time,
I'm gonna kill you.

447
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,720
Come on man.

448
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,730
You need more laughter in your life,
you know, you're way too tense.

449
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,150
They post it yet?

450
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:02,770
"We've learned from reputable sources that
Mordecai Murdoch has a fatal fear of firearms".

451
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,055
Alright.

452
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,330
How long do we wait?

453
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,240
Long enough for the new story to spread.

454
00:31:08,275 --> 00:31:09,650
And the legend to change.

455
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,060
I figure by nightfall, iron rounds will work
on the sucker.

456
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,780
Sweet.

457
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,430
You did it?

458
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,980
I did.

459
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,820
I'm telling you.

460
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,140
I heard something.

461
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,410
Coming from over there.

462
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,700
See, see? There it is again.

463
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,260
What is that?

464
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,210
What's the...

465
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,830
Yeah, I barely have any skin left
on my palm.

466
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,490
I'm not touching that line with
a ten foot pole.

467
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,630
Well, you think Mordecai's at home?

468
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,780
I don't know.

469
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,460
Me neither.

470
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,570
Whoo hey... whoo

471
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,140
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

472
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,210
We were just trying to get a
bulky movie deal, okay?

473
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,590
Oh crap!

474
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,870
Guys, you want to go for that door for us?

475
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,710
Why, don't you?

476
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,380
He's gone, he's gone.

477
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,865
- Did you get him?
- Oh yeah, they got him.

478
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,980
- No, on camera, did you get him on camera?
- Oh, I... I...

479
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,290
Give me this.

480
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,335
Didn't you guys post that bs story
we gave you?

481
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,560
- Of course we did.
- And then our server crashed.

482
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,320
So it didn't take.

483
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,960
So these guns don't work.

484
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,000
Yeah.

485
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,500
Great.

486
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,100
Sam, any ideas?

487
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,120
- We're gonna get out of here.
- Yeah.

488
00:34:05,155 --> 00:34:06,750
Come on Ed.

489
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,760
Ok, let's go let's go!

490
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,830
The power of Christ impels you!

491
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,010
Hey!

492
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,370
Come get it, you son of a bitch!

493
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,790
- Get out of here, now!
- Come on, let's go out of here!

494
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,620
Dean!

495
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,450
Hey!

496
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,800
Go go go!

497
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,070
Come on!

498
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,180
Look, Mordecai can't leave the house,
and we can't kill him.

499
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,560
We improvise.

500
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,805
That's your solution?!

501
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,920
Burn the whole damn place to the grounds?

502
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,530
No one will go in anymore.

503
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,760
Well look, Mordecai can't haunt a house when
there's no house to haunt.

504
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,770
It's fast and dirty, but it works.

505
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,430
But what if the legend changes again
and Mordecai's allowed to leave the house?

506
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,560
Well, we'll just have to come back.

507
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,410
Kind of makes you wonder.

508
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,750
Of all the things we've hunted,

509
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,850
how many existed just because people
believe in them?

510
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,420
That guy just has like
a super-high attack bonus.

511
00:36:22,455 --> 00:36:25,240
- Gentlemen.
- Hey guys.

512
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,270
Should we tell them?

513
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,280
You might as well, you know, they're just
gonna read about it in the traits.

514
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,540
So, this morning we got a phone call from a
very important hollywood producer.

515
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,870
Yeah, wrong number.

516
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:37,315
No, smart ass.

517
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,990
He read all about the Hell House on our website and
wants to option the motion picture rights.

518
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,710
Maybe even let us write it.

519
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,940
And create the RPG.

520
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,930
The what?

521
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,590
A role playing game.

522
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,390
Right.

523
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,390
A little lingo for you.

524
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,270
Anywho, uh...

525
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,370
excuse us, we're off to la la land.

526
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,000
Well, congratulations guys,
that sounds really great.

527
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,860
Yeah... that's awesome, best luck to you.

528
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,605
Oh yeah luck,
it's got nothing with it. It's...

529
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,340
about talent, you know. Sheer,
unabashed talent.

530
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,650
Later.

531
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,880
See you around.

532
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,580
Whoa.

533
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,095
- I have a confession to make.
- What's that?

534
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,700
I was the one who called them, and
told them I was a producer.

535
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,220
Well, I'm the one who put the dead fish
in their backseat.

536
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,710
Truce?

537
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,560
Yeah, truce.

538
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,700
At least for the next hundred miles.
