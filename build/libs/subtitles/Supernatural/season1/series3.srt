Previously on Supernatural.

2
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:09,101
Take your brother outside as  fast
as you can ! Now Dean ! Go !

3
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:12,024
Mary ! No !

4
00:00:13,784 --> 00:00:14,923
Dad's on a hunting trip.

5
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:17,599
And he hasn't been
home in a few days.

6
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:20,964
I swore I was done hunting,

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,146
I can't do this alone.

8
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:30,089
We got work to do.

9
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:31,722
This is dad's single

10
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:33,039
most valuable possession.

11
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,371
Everything he knows about
every evil thing is in here.

12
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:37,380
I think he wants us to
pick up where he left off.

13
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:38,724
You know, saving people,

14
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:39,836
hunting things...

15
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:40,755
Family business.

16
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:41,283
No.

17
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:42,696
I gotta find Jessica's killer.

18
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:44,206
It's the only thing
I can think about.

19
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,108
Sam, you know we're
gonna find dad, right ?

20
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,310
Yeah, I know.

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,740
Morning, daddy.

23
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:07,179
Morning, sweetheart.

24
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:11,674
All these workouts,
Soph, I don't know.

25
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,599
Guys don't like buff girls.

26
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:16,561
Yeah, well, girls don't like
guys who still live at home.

27
00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:24,873
Be careful.

28
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:26,031
I will.

29
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:03,902
Can I get you anything else ?

30
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:08,674
Just the check, please.

31
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,679
Okay.

32
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:17,707
You know, Sam, we are allowed
to have fun once in a while.

33
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:21,634
That's fun.

34
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,990
Here, take a look at this.
I think I got one.

35
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,930
Lake Manitoc, Wisconsin.

36
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:31,729
Last week, Sophie Carlton,

37
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:34,049
18, walks into the lake,

38
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,317
doesn't walk out.

39
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:37,038
Authorities dragged the water.

40
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,008
Nothing.

41
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,048
Sophie Carlton is the third
Lake Manitoc drowning this year.

42
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:42,941
None of the other bodies
were found, either

43
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:44,224
They had a funeral
two days ago.

44
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:44,897
A funeral ?

45
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,977
Yes, they buried an empty coffin.

46
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:50,114
for closure or whatever.

47
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:51,428
Closure ?

48
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,508
What closure ?

49
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:55,480
People don't just
disappear, Dean.

50
00:03:55,714 --> 00:03:57,670
Other people just stop
looking for them.

51
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,553
Something you want
to say to me ?

52
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:03,327
The trail for dad.
It's getting colder.

53
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,031
every day.

54
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:06,080
- What are we supposed to do ?
- I don't know.

55
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:07,128
Something.

56
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:08,411
- Anything.
- No one.

57
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,840
I'm sick of this attitude.

58
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,749
You don't think I want to find
dad as much as you do ?

59
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,562
Yeah, I know you do it.

60
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:15,269
I'm the one that's been with him
every single day for the past two years.

61
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,569
While you've been off to
college going to pep rallies.

62
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,898
We will find dad,

63
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:21,167
but until then, we're
gonna kill everything bad,

64
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:22,841
between here and there.

65
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:24,703
Okay ?

66
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:33,332
All right, Lake Manitoc.

67
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:34,411
Hey.

68
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:34,959
Huh ?

69
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:35,804
How far ?

70
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:57,963
Will Carlton ?

71
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,027
Yeah, that's right.

72
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:00,247
I'm agent Ford.

73
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:01,773
This is agent Hamill.

74
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,042
We're with the U.S.
Wildlife service.

75
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,221
She was about 100 yards out.

76
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:15,943
That's where she
got dragged down.

77
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:17,351
And you're sure she
didn't just drown ?

78
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:17,821
Yeah.

79
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,573
She was a varsity swimmer.

80
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,450
She practically
grew up in that lake.

81
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:24,751
She's as safe out there
as in her own bathtub.

82
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,597
So no splashing,

83
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:27,802
no signs of distress ?

84
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,006
No, that's what
I'm telling you.

85
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:31,326
Did you see any
shadows in the water,

86
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,016
maybe,

87
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:35,659
some dark shape
breach the surface ?

88
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:37,724
No, again, she was
really far out there.

89
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:39,570
You ever see any strange
tracks by the shoreline ?

90
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:40,509
No, never.

91
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:41,432
Why ?

92
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:42,903
What do you think's out there ?

93
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:45,641
We'll let you know
as soon as we do.

94
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:49,380
What about your father ?

95
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,070
Can we talk to him ?

96
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,782
Look.

97
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:55,377
If you don't mind,
I mean,

98
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:58,100
he didn't see anything, and
he's kind of been through a lot.

99
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,243
We understand.

100
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:07,542
Now, I'm sorry, but,

101
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:11,767
why does the wildlife service
care about an accidental drowning ?

102
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:13,247
You sure it's accidental ?

103
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,489
Will Carlton saw
something grab his sister.

104
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:17,195
Like what ?

105
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:18,665
Here, sit, please.

106
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,748
There are no indigenous
carnivores in that lake.

107
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,642
There's nothing even big
enough to pull down a person,

108
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:26,574
unless it was the Loch Ness monster.

109
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:28,882
Yeah, right.

110
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:33,075
Will Carlton was traumatized, and
sometimes the mind plays tricks.

111
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:34,362
Still,

112
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,461
we dragged that entire lake.
We even ran a sonar sweep,

113
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,282
just to be sure, and there
was nothing down there.

114
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:43,410
That's weird, though.

115
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,444
That's the third
missing body this year.

116
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:46,622
I know.

117
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,063
These are people from my town.

118
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:50,721
These are people I care about.

119
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:51,644
I know.

120
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:54,074
Anyway . . .

121
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,031
All this.

122
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:00,239
It won't be a problem
much longer.

123
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:01,866
What do you mean ?

124
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:04,188
Well, the dam,
of course.

125
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:06,691
Of course.

126
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:07,864
The dam.

127
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,210
It's, uh...

128
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:11,494
It sprung a leak.

129
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:12,699
It's falling apart,

130
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:16,067
and the feds won't give
us the grant to repair it,

131
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,820
so they've opened
the spillway.

132
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:20,229
In another six months,

133
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,263
there won't be
much of a lake.

134
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:24,082
There won't be much
of a town, either,

135
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:25,287
but as federal wildlife,

136
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,805
you already knew that.

137
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:28,338
Exactly.

138
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:30,935
Sorry, am I interrupting ?

139
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:32,692
I think come back later.

140
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,835
Gentlemen, this is my daughter.

141
00:07:35,258 --> 00:07:36,447
It's a pleasure to meet you.

142
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,714
I'm Dean.

143
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,482
Andrea Barrr. Hi.

144
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:40,108
Hi.

145
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:41,849
They're from the
wildlife service,

146
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,711
about the lake.

147
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:49,208
Oh, hey, there.

148
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:50,448
What's your name ?

149
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,099
His name is Lucas.

150
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:01,850
Is he okay ?

151
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:03,555
My grandson's been through a lot.

152
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:05,793
We all have.

153
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:07,482
Well,

154
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,818
if there's anything else
I can do for you,

155
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:10,899
please, let me know.

156
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:11,774
Thanks.

157
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:14,360
You know, now that
you mentioned it,

158
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:17,693
could you point us in the direction
of a reasonably priced motel ?

159
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:20,592
Lakefront motel, go around
the corner, it's two blocks up.

160
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:21,374
Two.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,001
Would you mind showing us ?

162
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:26,068
You want me to
walk you two blocks ?

163
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:27,429
Not if it's any trouble.

164
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:29,900
I'm headed that way anyway.

165
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:33,092
I'll be back to pick up lucas at 3:00.

166
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,922
We'll go to the park,
okay, sweetie ?

167
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,981
Thanks again.

168
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:42,265
So, cute kid.

169
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,204
Thanks.

170
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:46,824
Kids are the best, huh ?

171
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,960
There it is.

172
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,072
Like I said, two blocks.

173
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,917
Thanks.

174
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,171
Must be hard with
your sense of direction,

175
00:08:58,547 --> 00:09:01,441
never being able to find your
way to a decent pickup line.

176
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:04,215
Enjoy your stay.

177
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,204
"Kids are the best" ?

178
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:09,649
- You don't even like kids.
- I love kids.

179
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:11,949
Name three children
that you even know.

180
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:19,740
I'm thinking.

181
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:22,650
So there's the three
drowning victims this year.

182
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:23,620
And before that ?

183
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:26,530
Yeah, six more,

184
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:28,141
spread outover the past 35 years.

185
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:30,081
Those bodies were
never recovered, either.

186
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,178
If there is something out there,

187
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:33,283
it's picking up its pace.

188
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:34,863
So we got a lake monster on a binge ?

189
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,601
This whole lake monster
theory, it just bugs me.

190
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:38,712
Why ?

191
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:41,001
Loch Ness, lake Champlain

192
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:43,598
there are literally hundreds
of eyewitness accounts,

193
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:45,507
but here, almost nothing.

194
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,115
Whatever it is out there,

195
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,777
Noone's living to talk about it.

196
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:50,295
Wait, Barr,

197
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,428
Christopher Barr, where have
I heard that name before ?

198
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,072
Christopher Barr,
the victim in may.

199
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,639
Christopher Barr was
Andrea's husband,

200
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:00,373
Lucas' father.

201
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,708
Apparently,

202
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:03,773
he took Lucas out swimming.

203
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,246
Lucas was on a floating wooden
platform when Chris drowned,

204
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:08,685
two hours,

205
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:10,970
before the kid got rescued.

206
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:16,711
Maybe we have an
eyewitness after all.

207
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:19,011
No wonder that kid
was so freaked out.

208
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,958
Watching one of your parents die
isn't something you just get over.

209
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,385
Can we join you ?

210
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:31,801
I'm here with my son.

211
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:36,432
Mind if I say hi ?

212
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:42,212
Tell your friend this whole "jerry maguire"
thing's not gonna work on me.

213
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:44,700
I don't think that's
what this is about.

214
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:49,133
How's it going ?

215
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,826
Oh, I used to
love these things.

216
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:07,451
So crayons is
more your thing ?

217
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:09,970
That's cool.
Chicks dig artists.

218
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:13,786
Hey, these are pretty good.

219
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:17,431
You mind if I sit and
draw with you for a while ?

220
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:19,454
I'm not so bad myself.

221
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:30,826
You know, I'm thinking
you can hear me.

222
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:32,797
You just don't want to talk.

223
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:35,535
I don't know exactly
what happened to your dad,

224
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:38,501
but I know it was
something real bad.

225
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,585
I think I know how you feel.

226
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,325
When I was your age,
I saw something.

227
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,397
Anyway . . .

228
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:01,221
Maybe you don't think
anyone will listen to you.

229
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:02,947
Or, uh...

230
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,963
Or believe you.

231
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:08,341
I want you to know that I will.

232
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:11,266
You don't even have to

233
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,331
say anything.
You could draw me a picture,

234
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:14,740
about what you saw that day,

235
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:16,274
with your dad,

236
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:18,433
on the lake.

237
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:23,425
Okay,

238
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,535
no problem.

239
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:26,022
This is for you.

240
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:28,462
This is my family.

241
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:30,997
That's my dad.

242
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:32,206
That's...

243
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:34,944
That's my mom.

244
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:37,311
That's my geek brother,

245
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:39,392
and that's me.

246
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:44,977
All right, so I'm
a sucky artist.

247
00:12:45,404 --> 00:12:46,765
I'll see you around, Lucas.

248
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:02,912
Lucas hasn't said a word,
not even to me,

249
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:04,623
not since

250
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,157
his dad's accident.

251
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,972
Yeah, we heard.

252
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:10,177
Sorry.

253
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:13,102
What are the doctors saying ?

254
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,879
That it's a kind of
post-traumatic stress.

255
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:17,194
That can't be easy

256
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,054
for either of you.

257
00:13:18,117 --> 00:13:19,619
We moved in with my dad.

258
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:22,247
He helps out a lot.

259
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:25,384
It's just...

260
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:30,312
when I think about what Lucas
went through, what he saw...

261
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:33,926
Kids are strong.

262
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:36,504
You'd be surprised
what they can deal with.

263
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:38,366
You know,

264
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:40,494
he used to have such life.

265
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:43,169
He was hard to keep up with,
to tell you the truth.

266
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:45,761
Now he just sits there,

267
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:48,483
drawing those pictures,
playing with those army men.

268
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,022
I just wish.

269
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,805
Hey, sweetie.

270
00:13:57,318 --> 00:13:58,100
Thanks.

271
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:00,259
Thanks, Lucas.

272
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,627
Hey, dad.

273
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:22,834
You should probably
eat something.

274
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:26,547
I'm gonna make
some dinner, okay ?

275
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,189
So,

276
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:24,317
I think it's safe to say
we can rule out Nessie.

277
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,146
What do you mean ?

278
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:28,358
I just drove past the Carlton house.
There was an ambulance there.

279
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:29,907
Will Carlton is dead.

280
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:30,720
He drowned ?

281
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:32,379
Yep, in the sink.

282
00:16:33,098 --> 00:16:34,240
What the hell ?

283
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,858
So this isn't a creature. We're
dealing with something else.

284
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:37,687
Yeah, but what ?

285
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:38,344
I don't know.

286
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:39,611
A water wraith maybe ?

287
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:40,925
Some kind of demon ?

288
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:42,811
I mean, something
that controls water...

289
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:46,791
..water that comes
from the Same source.

290
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:47,667
- The lake
- Yeah

291
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,607
which would explain why
it's upping the body count.

292
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:52,877
The lake is draining. It'll be dry in
a few months. Whatever this thing is,

293
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:54,388
whatever it wants,

294
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:55,577
it's running out of time.

295
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:57,158
And if it can get
through the pipes,

296
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:58,602
it can get to anyone,

297
00:16:58,665 --> 00:16:59,603
almost anywhere.

298
00:16:59,697 --> 00:17:01,700
This is gonna happen again soon.

299
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:03,483
And we do know one other thing for sure.

300
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,815
We know this has got
something to do with Bill Carlton.

301
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:06,901
It took both his kids.

302
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:08,199
And I've been asking around.

303
00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:09,560
Lucas' dad, Chris

304
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:11,328
Bill Carlton's godson.

305
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,753
Let's go pay
Mr. Carlton a visit.

306
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:17,532
Mr. Carlton ?

307
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:22,272
We'd like to ask you
a few questions,

308
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:23,039
if you don't mind.

309
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:25,495
- We're from the department
- I don't care who you're with.

310
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,614
I've answered
enough questions today.

311
00:17:30,694 --> 00:17:33,432
Your son said he saw
something in that lake.

312
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:35,560
What about you ?

313
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,663
You ever see anything out there ?

314
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:40,119
Mr. Carlton,

315
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,106
Sophie's drowning
and Will's death.

316
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:43,874
We think there might
be a connection,

317
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:46,862
- to you or your family.
- My children are gone.

318
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:51,214
It's...

319
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:56,032
It's worse than dying.

320
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:04,318
Go away...

321
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:06,852
Please.

322
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:11,081
What do you think ?

323
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:14,053
I think the poor guy's
been through hell.

324
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:16,650
I also think he's not
telling us something.

325
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:17,699
So now what ?

326
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,406
What is it ?

327
00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:27,727
Maybe Bill's not the only
one who knows something.

328
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,237
I'm sorry, but I don't
think it's a good idea.

329
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:41,432
I just need to talk to him,

330
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,559
just for a few minutes.

331
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:44,342
He won't say anything.

332
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:46,454
- What good's it gonna do?
- Andrea,

333
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,269
we think more people
might get hurt.

334
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:51,215
We think something's
happening out there.

335
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:53,953
My husband, the others,
they just drowned.

336
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,095
That's all.

337
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:56,300
If that's what
you really believe,

338
00:18:56,362 --> 00:18:57,129
then we'll go,

339
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,386
but if you think
there's even a possibility

340
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:01,483
that something else
could be going on here,

341
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,549
please let me talk to your son.

342
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:21,251
Hey, Lucas.

343
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:23,900
You remember me ?

344
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:34,705
You know, I, uh...

345
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:38,773
I wanted to thank you
for that last drawing...

346
00:19:41,928 --> 00:19:43,586
..but the thing is

347
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:45,448
I need your help again.

348
00:19:58,418 --> 00:20:00,061
How did you know
to draw this ?

349
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,150
Did you know something
bad was gonna happen ?

350
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,295
Maybe you could

351
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:10,250
nod yes or no

352
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:11,173
for me.

353
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:14,693
You're scared.

354
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:20,730
It's okay.

355
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,732
I understand.

356
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:24,610
See, when I was your age,

357
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:27,176
I saw something real
bad happen to my mom,

358
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:31,326
and I was scared, too.

359
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:35,524
I didn't feel like talking,

360
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:37,057
just like you,

361
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:39,795
but, see, my mom,

362
00:20:42,204 --> 00:20:44,269
I know she wanted
me to be brave.

363
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:49,249
I think about
that every day.

364
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:56,418
And I do my best
to be brave.

365
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:02,003
And maybe your dad

366
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:05,707
wants you to be brave, too.

367
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:28,826
Thanks, Lucas.

368
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:36,136
Andrea said the kid never drew
like that till his dad died.

369
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,547
There are cases going
through a traumatic experience

370
00:21:39,735 --> 00:21:44,386
could make certain people more sensitive
to premonitions, psychic tendencies.

371
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:46,767
What if Lucas is
tapping into it somehow ?

372
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:49,030
It's only a matter of time
before somebody else drowns,

373
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:50,702
so if you got
a better lead, please.

374
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,460
All right.

375
00:21:52,699 --> 00:21:53,654
We got another house to find.

376
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,096
There's about a thousand yellow
two-stories in this county alone.

377
00:21:57,722 --> 00:21:58,927
See this church ?

378
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:01,415
I bet there's less than
a thousand of those around here.

379
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:05,002
Oh, college boy
thinks he's so smart.

380
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:13,709
You know, um...

381
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,947
What you said about mom.

382
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:21,703
You never told me that before.

383
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:23,503
It's no big deal.

384
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:30,219
Oh, god, we're not gonna have
to hug or anything, are we ?

385
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,263
We're sorry to bother you, ma'am,

386
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:00,735
but does a little boy
live here by chance ?

387
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:01,877
He might wear

388
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:03,082
a blue ball cap,

389
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:04,709
has a red bicycle.

390
00:23:05,578 --> 00:23:06,626
No, sir.

391
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:10,349
Not for a very long time.

392
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:14,652
Peter's been gone 35 years now.

393
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:19,297
The police never

394
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:23,255
I never had any idea
what happened.

395
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,483
He just disappeared.

396
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:30,522
Losing him,

397
00:23:32,697 --> 00:23:33,635
you know,

398
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:35,708
it's...

399
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,702
It's worse than dying.

400
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:46,482
Did he disappear from here,

401
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:47,530
I mean, from this house ?

402
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:48,813
He was supposed to

403
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:50,784
ride his bike

404
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,208
straight home

405
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:53,412
after school,

406
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:55,352
and he never showed up.

407
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,250
"Peter Sweeney and Billy Carlton,

408
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:15,976
1970."

409
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:23,053
You've taken everything,

410
00:24:25,572 --> 00:24:26,824
everyone.

411
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:31,084
I've got nothing left.

412
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,012
I didn't understand.

413
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:39,490
I didn't believe.

414
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:43,698
Now I think I do.

415
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:48,147
I think I finally
know what you want.

416
00:24:53,221 --> 00:24:55,427
Okay, this little boy,
Peter Sweeney, vanishes,

417
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:57,820
and this is all connected
to Bill Carlton somehow.

418
00:24:57,852 --> 00:24:59,776
Bill sure as hell seems
to be hiding something.

419
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,262
And Bill, the people he loves

420
00:25:01,408 --> 00:25:02,253
they're all getting punished.

421
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:03,865
So that Bill did
something to Peter.

422
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:05,210
What if Bill killed him ?

423
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:07,056
Peter's spirit
would be furious.

424
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:08,574
It'd want revenge.
It's possible.

425
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:15,537
Mr. Carlton !

426
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,089
Hey. Check it out.

427
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:30,148
Mr. Carlton !
You need to come back !

428
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:33,559
Come out of the water !
Turn the boat around !

429
00:25:47,364 --> 00:25:48,881
Baby, what's wrong ?

430
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:53,575
Sam, Dean.

431
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:56,287
I didn't expect
to see you here.

432
00:25:57,273 --> 00:25:59,181
So now you're on
a first-name basis.

433
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,450
What are you doing here ?

434
00:26:01,502 --> 00:26:02,706
I brought you dinner.

435
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:05,961
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I don't really have the time.

436
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:11,786
I heard about Bill Carlton.

437
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:14,446
Is it true? Is something
going on with the lake ?

438
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:18,185
Right now, we don't
know what the truth is,

439
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,939
but I think it might be better
if you and lucas went on home.

440
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,595
Lucas, hey, what is it ?

441
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:27,238
- Lucas.
- Lucas.

442
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:29,882
Lucas, it's okay.
It's okay. Hey,

443
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,404
Lucas, it's okay.
It's okay.

444
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:57,985
Okay, just so I'm clear,
you see . . .

445
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:59,142
something

446
00:26:59,627 --> 00:27:01,161
attack Bill's boat,

447
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,835
sending Bill,

448
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:06,647
who is a very good
swimmer, by the way,

449
00:27:06,913 --> 00:27:08,196
into the drink,

450
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,746
and you never
see him again ?

451
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:14,640
Yeah, that about sums it up.

452
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:16,189
And I'm supposed
to believe this,

453
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:18,958
even though I've already
sonar-swept that entire lake

454
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:21,665
and what you're
describing is impossible

455
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:24,652
and you're not really
wildlife service ?

456
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:26,768
That's right,

457
00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:27,722
I checked.

458
00:27:28,004 --> 00:27:29,631
The department's
never heard of you two.

459
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:30,841
See ?

460
00:27:30,935 --> 00:27:32,843
- Now, we can explain that.
- Enough,

461
00:27:33,594 --> 00:27:34,674
please.

462
00:27:35,816 --> 00:27:38,194
The only reason
you're breathing free air

463
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:42,298
is one of Bill's neighbors saw him
steering out that boat just before you did.

464
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:43,691
So

465
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:45,505
we have a couple
of options here.

466
00:27:45,803 --> 00:27:47,988
I can arrest you for
impersonating government officials

467
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:51,608
and hold you as material witnesses
to Bill Carlton's disappearance,

468
00:27:51,857 --> 00:27:52,670
or

469
00:27:52,983 --> 00:27:55,799
we can chalk this
all up to a bad day,

470
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,525
you get into your car,

471
00:27:57,665 --> 00:28:00,548
you put this town
in your rearview mirror,

472
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:03,704
and you don't ever
darken my doorstep

473
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:04,476
again !

474
00:28:07,182 --> 00:28:08,746
Door number two sounds good.

475
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:10,499
That's the one I'd pick.

476
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:26,429
Baby...

477
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:29,800
What are you doing up ?

478
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:34,353
Come on, let's go to bed.

479
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:56,669
Green.

480
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,498
What ?

481
00:28:57,623 --> 00:28:59,016
Light's green.

482
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:08,126
Ah, the interstate's
the other way.

483
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:08,767
I know.

484
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,481
But, Dean, this job,
I think it's over.

485
00:29:35,528 --> 00:29:36,372
I'm not so sure.

486
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:39,439
If bill murdered Peter Sweeney
and Peter's spirit got its revenge,

487
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:41,692
case closed.
The spirit should be at rest.

488
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:44,053
All right, so what if we take off
and this thing isn't done ?

489
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,374
What if we missed something ?
What if more people get hurt ?

490
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,032
But why would you think that ?

491
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:51,520
Because Lucas
was really scared.

492
00:29:51,786 --> 00:29:53,273
That's what this is about ?

493
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:56,574
I just don't want to leave town
till I know the kid's okay.

494
00:29:57,043 --> 00:29:58,029
Who are you,

495
00:29:58,138 --> 00:29:59,969
and what have you
done with my brother ?

496
00:30:02,346 --> 00:30:03,551
Shut up.

497
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,343
Are you sure about this ?

498
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:36,970
It's pretty late, man.

499
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:41,762
Lucas ? Lucas !

500
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:45,626
Lucas !

501
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:25,761
Can you tell me ?

502
00:32:27,893 --> 00:32:28,754
No

503
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:38,503
It doesn't make any sense.

504
00:32:42,602 --> 00:32:44,135
I'm going crazy.

505
00:32:45,152 --> 00:32:46,671
No, you're not.

506
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:49,269
Tell me what happened.

507
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:50,818
Everything.

508
00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:56,134
I heard...

509
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:00,844
I thought I heard...

510
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:04,967
there was this voice.

511
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,453
What did it say ?

512
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,345
It said

513
00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:10,558
it said, "come play with me."

514
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,052
What's happening ?

515
00:33:39,342 --> 00:33:41,157
Do you recognize the
kids in these pictures ?

516
00:33:41,282 --> 00:33:42,033
What ?

517
00:33:43,942 --> 00:33:44,834
No, I huh...

518
00:33:44,912 --> 00:33:48,025
I mean, except that's
my dad right there.

519
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:49,594
He must have been about

520
00:33:50,204 --> 00:33:51,831
12 in these pictures.

521
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,821
Chris Barr's drowning

522
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:57,465
the connection wasn't to Bill Carlton.
It must have been to sheriff.

523
00:33:57,527 --> 00:33:58,982
Bill and the sheriff,

524
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:00,954
they were both
involved with Peter.

525
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:02,252
What about Chris ?

526
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:05,026
My dad, what are
you talking about ?

527
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:06,153
Lucas ?

528
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:08,202
Lucas, what is it ?

529
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:16,684
Lucas, honey ?

530
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,881
You and Lucas get back to
the house and stay there, okay ?

531
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:56,435
Peter's bike.

532
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,281
Who are you?

533
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:03,162
Put the gun down, Jake.

534
00:35:03,866 --> 00:35:05,341
How did you know
that was there ?

535
00:35:05,388 --> 00:35:06,233
What happened ?

536
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,985
You and Bill killed Peter,

537
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,176
drowned him in the lake,
and then buried the bike ?

538
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,851
You can't bury
the truth, Jake.

539
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,657
Nothing stays buried.

540
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:20,726
Go to your room, sweetie.

541
00:35:22,009 --> 00:35:22,854
Now.

542
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:25,172
Lock the door and wait
for me. Don't come out.

543
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:26,907
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

544
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:29,348
You and Bill killed
Peter Sweeney 35 years ago.

545
00:35:29,442 --> 00:35:30,360
that's what the hell
I'm talking about.

546
00:35:30,365 --> 00:35:30,975
Dad

547
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,337
And now you got one
seriously pissed-off spirit.

548
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:34,636
It's gonna take Andrea,

549
00:35:34,745 --> 00:35:35,527
Lucas,

550
00:35:35,827 --> 00:35:36,812
everyone you love.

551
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:38,393
It's gonna drown them,

552
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:40,661
and it's gonna drag their
bodies god knows where.

553
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:43,227
So you can feel the Same
pain Peter's mom felt.

554
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:45,386
And then after that,

555
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:47,325
it's gonna take you,

556
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:49,359
and it's not gonna
stop until it does.

557
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,314
How do you know that ?

558
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,880
Because that's exactly
what it did to Bill Carlton.

559
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:55,072
Listen to yourselves,

560
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:55,933
both of you.

561
00:35:55,995 --> 00:35:57,122
You're insane.

562
00:35:57,169 --> 00:35:59,359
I don't really give a rat's ass
what you think of us,

563
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,010
but if we're gonna
bring down this spirit,

564
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:03,778
we need to find the remains,

565
00:36:04,044 --> 00:36:04,857
salt them,

566
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,125
and burn them into dust.

567
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:07,840
Tell me you buried
Peter somewhere.

568
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:09,593
Tell me you didn't just
let him go in the lake.

569
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,651
Come play with me.

570
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,083
Dad,

571
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,178
is any of this true ?

572
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:24,461
No. Don't listen to them.

573
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:25,791
They're liars,
and they're dangerous.

574
00:36:25,947 --> 00:36:27,574
Something tried
to drown me.

575
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:29,405
Chris died on that lake.

576
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:30,578
Dad, look at me.

577
00:36:33,894 --> 00:36:34,566
Tell me you

578
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:36,162
you didn't kill anyone.

579
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,161
Oh, my god.

580
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:52,709
Billy and I were at the lake.

581
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:58,420
Peter was the smallest one.
We always bullied him,

582
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:00,062
but this time...

583
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,414
It got rough.

584
00:37:07,343 --> 00:37:08,985
We were holding his
head under the water.

585
00:37:09,882 --> 00:37:11,134
We didn't mean to,

586
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,653
but we held him
under too long,

587
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:14,983
and he drowned.

588
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:23,289
We let the body go,

589
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,073
and it sank.

590
00:37:32,146 --> 00:37:33,382
Oh, Andrea.

591
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:37,659
We were kids.

592
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,051
We were so scared.

593
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:40,099
It was a mistake,

594
00:37:40,115 --> 00:37:40,970
but, Andrea,

595
00:37:41,262 --> 00:37:43,671
to say that I have anything
to do with these drownings,

596
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:44,829
with Chris,

597
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:46,894
because of some ghost

598
00:37:47,176 --> 00:37:48,725
it's not rational.

599
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:51,013
All right, listen to me,

600
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:52,468
all of you.

601
00:37:53,141 --> 00:37:54,643
We need to get you
away from this lake

602
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:56,379
as far as we can right now.

603
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:00,882
Lucas !

604
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:06,754
Come play with me.

605
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:08,444
Lucas !

606
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:11,327
Lucas !
Stay where you are !

607
00:38:30,315 --> 00:38:31,410
Oh, my god !

608
00:38:34,883 --> 00:38:36,072
Andrea, stay there.

609
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,293
No, Lucas !

610
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:38,643
We'll get him.
Stay on the dock.

611
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:45,904
Lucas ?

612
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:49,420
Sam ?

613
00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:52,862
Lucas, where are you ?

614
00:38:57,138 --> 00:38:57,764
Peter,

615
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:58,906
if you can hear me,

616
00:39:00,068 --> 00:39:01,006
please, Peter,

617
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:01,789
I'm sorry.

618
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:04,104
- I'm so...
- Dad, no !

619
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:05,215
I'm so sorry.

620
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:06,279
Peter.

621
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:07,202
Lucas

622
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:09,658
he's j... he's
just a little boy.

623
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:12,448
Please, it's not
his fault. It's mine.

624
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:13,762
Please take me !

625
00:39:14,763 --> 00:39:15,311
Jake,

626
00:39:15,373 --> 00:39:15,733
no !

627
00:39:17,032 --> 00:39:18,487
Listen, let it be over!

628
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:21,436
Dad

629
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:23,099
Daddy !

630
00:39:25,632 --> 00:39:26,492
No

631
00:39:36,486 --> 00:39:37,346
No...

632
00:40:17,737 --> 00:40:18,473
Look,

633
00:40:19,302 --> 00:40:20,679
we're not gonna
save everybody.

634
00:40:23,312 --> 00:40:23,969
I know.

635
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:25,502
Sam,

636
00:40:25,878 --> 00:40:26,566
Dean.

637
00:40:26,707 --> 00:40:27,473
Hey.

638
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:30,352
We're glad
we caught you.

639
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,682
We just, um,

640
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,377
we made you
lunch for the road.

641
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:37,897
Lucas insisted on making
the sandwiches himself.

642
00:40:39,372 --> 00:40:40,421
Can I give it
to them now ?

643
00:40:42,345 --> 00:40:42,955
Of course.

644
00:40:44,174 --> 00:40:45,989
Come on, Lucas,
let's load this in the car.

645
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:53,549
How you holding up?

646
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,916
It's just gonna take a long time
to sort through everything, you know ?

647
00:41:02,863 --> 00:41:04,459
Andrea, I'm sorry.

648
00:41:06,054 --> 00:41:07,259
You saved my son.

649
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:10,779
I can't ask
for more than that.

650
00:41:14,454 --> 00:41:15,315
Dad loved me.

651
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:17,693
He loved Lucas.

652
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,680
No matter what he did,

653
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:20,822
I just have to...

654
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:23,628
hold on to that.

655
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:30,643
All right,

656
00:41:30,806 --> 00:41:32,277
if you're gonna
be talking now,

657
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:35,580
this is a very important phrase, so
I want you to repeat it one more time.

658
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:36,730
Zeppelin rules !

659
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:38,140
That's right.
Up high.

660
00:41:41,826 --> 00:41:43,786
Take care of
your mom, okay ?

661
00:41:51,731 --> 00:41:53,268
Thank you.

662
00:41:58,444 --> 00:41:59,719
Sam, move your ass.

663
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:02,172
We're gonna run out of daylight
before we hit the road.
