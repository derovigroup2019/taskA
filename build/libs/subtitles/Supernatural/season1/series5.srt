Previously on Supernatural

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:06,511
Take your brother outside
as fast as you  can!

3
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:07,633
Now, Dean! Go!

4
00:00:09,546 --> 00:00:10,750
Mary ! No !

5
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:13,873
Dad's on a hunting trip.

6
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,486
And he hasn't been home in a few days.

7
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:20,010
I swore I was done hunting.

8
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:21,806
I can't do this alone.

9
00:00:24,413 --> 00:00:25,086
No!

10
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,025
We got work to do.

11
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:32,121
This is dad's single most
valuable possession

12
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:34,325
Everything he knows about
every evil thing is in here.

13
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:36,407
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off

14
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:38,856
You know, saving people, hunting things,

15
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:39,870
family business.

16
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:41,768
No. I got to find Jessica's killer.

17
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:43,319
It's the only thing
I can think about.

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,136
Sam, You know we're gonna find dad, right?

19
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:47,946
Yeah. I know.

20
00:00:57,485 --> 00:00:59,403
okay, your turn. Truth or dare?

21
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:00,479
Truth.

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,152
Do you want to make out with benji swartz?

23
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,091
Dare.

24
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:06,806
Okay, lame.

25
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:08,901
You have to...

26
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:11,759
say "bloody mary" in the bathroom.

27
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:14,345
Is that the best you can come up with?

28
00:01:14,712 --> 00:01:15,855
Who's bloody mary?

29
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:17,692
She's this witch.

30
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,958
I heard she was a lady killed in a car crash.

31
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,815
It doesn't matter who she is.

32
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:24,961
If you say her name three times
in the bathroom mirror,

33
00:01:25,777 --> 00:01:26,899
she appears...

34
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:28,900
and scratches your eyes out!

35
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:33,432
So why would anyone say it?

36
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:35,616
Because it isn't real.

37
00:01:37,044 --> 00:01:38,371
No turning on the lights.

38
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,949
And remember,

39
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:40,949
three times.

40
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:07,704
Bloody mary.

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,785
This is so stupid.

42
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,729
Bloody mary.

43
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:27,444
Bloody mary.

44
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:38,799
Scared you.

45
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:40,105
You guys are jerks.

46
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,065
Lily?

47
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:42,779
You mind keeping it down?

48
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:44,657
Sorry, daddy.

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,494
Sorry, mr. Shoemaker.

50
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:26,191
You so like him!

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,899
Hey, geek.

52
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:30,491
You guys having fun?

53
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:32,103
You're out past curfew.

54
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,669
Thanks, dad.

55
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,754
Why Sam ?

56
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:19,353
No!

57
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:24,551
- Why Sam?
- Sam, wake up.

58
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:35,261
I take it I was having a nightmare?

59
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:37,649
Yeah, another one.

60
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:42,746
Hey, at least I got some sleep.

61
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,175
Hey, you know, sooner or later,
we're gonna talk about this.

62
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:46,848
Are we here?

63
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:49,726
Yep. Welcome to Toledo, Ohio.

64
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:55,523
So, what do you think
really happened to this guy?

65
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:57,170
So what we're gonna find out.

66
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:00,517
Let's go.

67
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:30,253
Hey.

68
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:31,600
Hey.

69
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:33,763
Can I help you?

70
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,478
Yeah, we're the... med students.

71
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:37,557
Sorry?

72
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:38,822
Oh, doctor...

73
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,067
Fliglavitch didn't tell you?

74
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:43,026
We talked to him
on the phone.

75
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:44,394
We're from Ohio state.

76
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,737
He's supposed to show us
the shoemaker corpse.

77
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:47,513
It's for our paper.

78
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:49,574
Well, I'm sorry, he's at lunch.

79
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:50,391
Oh.

80
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:51,615
Well, he said, uh

81
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,064
oh, well, you know, it doesn't matter.

82
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,533
You don't mind showing us
the body, do you?

83
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:56,798
Sorry, I can't.

84
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:59,268
Doc will be back in an hour.
You can wait for him,

85
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,023
if you want.

86
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:00,941
An hour?

87
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:04,046
We got to be heading back
to columbus.

88
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:04,740
Yeah.

89
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:07,087
Look man, this paper's half our grade,

90
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:08,904
- So if you don't mind helping us out?
- Look, man

91
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:10,914
No.

92
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:15,160
I'm gonna hit him
in his face, I swear.

93
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:30,093
Follow me.

94
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:35,522
Dude, I earned that money.

95
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,169
You won it in a poker game.

96
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:38,190
Yeah.

97
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:40,802
The newspaper said his daughter found him.

98
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:42,755
She said his eyes were bleeding.

99
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:43,898
More than that.

100
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,572
They practically liquefied.

101
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,385
Any sign of a struggle,
maybe somebody did it to him?

102
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:53,239
Nope.

103
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:55,342
Besides the daughter, he was all alone.

104
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:57,805
What's the official causeof death?

105
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,963
Doc's not sure.
He's thinking massive stroke,

106
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,554
maybe an aneurysm.

107
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:04,870
Something burst up in there, that's for sure.

108
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:06,337
What do you mean?

109
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:08,606
Intense cerebral bleeding.

110
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,389
This guy had more blooding his skull
than anyone I've ever seen.

111
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:13,284
But the eyes?

112
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:15,085
What would cause something like that?

113
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:16,850
Capillaries can burst.

114
00:07:16,897 --> 00:07:18,862
See a lot of bloodshot eyes
with stroke victims.

115
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:21,341
Yeah, you ever see exploding eyeballs?

116
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,260
That's a first for me.

117
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,037
But, hey, I'm not the doctor.

118
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,644
Think we could take a look atthat police report?

119
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:30,398
You know, for our paper?

120
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,603
I'm not really supposed to show you

121
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:39,199
Might not be one of ours.

122
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,257
Might just be some freak medical thing.

123
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,198
How many times in dad's long

124
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,333
and varied career has it actually been
a freak medical thing

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,554
and not some sign
of an awful supernatural death?

126
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:51,636
Uh, almost never.

127
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:52,829
Exactly.

128
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:53,811
All right.

129
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:55,628
Let's go talk to the daughter.

130
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,414
Feel like we're underdressed.

131
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:26,087
You must be Donna,right?

132
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:26,883
Yeah.

133
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,859
Hi, uh... We're really sorry.

134
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:32,520
Thank you.

135
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:34,976
I'm sam.This is dean.

136
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,134
We worked with your dad.

137
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:39,262
You did?

138
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,830
Yeah.This whole thing

139
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,795
I mean, a stroke.

140
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:46,322
I don't think she really wants
to talk about this right now.

141
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:47,609
It's okay, I'm okay.

142
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:50,674
Were there ever any symptoms?

143
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,078
Dizziness, migraines?

144
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:54,019
No.

145
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,175
That's because it wasn't a stroke.

146
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:58,415
Lily, don't say that.

147
00:08:58,672 --> 00:08:59,374
What?

148
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:01,666
I'm sorry, she's just upset.

149
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,654
No, it happened because of me.

150
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:04,988
Sweetie, it didn't.

151
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:05,865
Lily,

152
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:08,621
why would you saysomething like that?

153
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,173
Right before he died,I said it.

154
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,694
You said what?

155
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,922
Bloody Mary, three times
in the bathroom mirror.

156
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:21,014
She took his eyes, that's what she does.

157
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,494
That's not why dad died.This isn't your fault.

158
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:25,739
I think your sister's right,lily.

159
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:28,749
There's no way it could
have been Bloody Mary.

160
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:32,118
Your dad didn't say it,did he?

161
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:35,322
No, I don't think so.

162
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:01,972
Sam:The Bloody Mary legend

163
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:06,299
dad ever find any evidence
that it was a real thing?

164
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:08,357
Not that I know of.

165
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:14,397
I mean,

166
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:15,988
everywhere else,

167
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,126
all over the country,
kids will play Bloody Mary.

168
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,373
And as far as we know, nobody dies from it.

169
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,209
Hey well, maybe everywhere
it's just a story,

170
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:26,846
but here it's actually happening.

171
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,530
The place where the legend began?

172
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:32,079
But according to the legend,
the person who says...

173
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,880
the person who says you know what gets it

174
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:38,488
But here...

175
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:40,055
Shoemaker gets it instead,yeah.

176
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:40,710
Right.

177
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:43,540
Never heard anything like that before.

178
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,832
Still, the guy did die
right in front of the mirror.

179
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:49,229
And the daughter's right.
The way the legend goes,

180
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:51,772
"you know who" scratches your eyes out.

181
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:53,292
It's worth checking into.

182
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,479
What are you doingup here?

183
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:03,590
We...

184
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:05,555
we had to go to the bathroom.

185
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:07,520
Who are you?

186
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,076
Like we said downstairs,
we worked with Donna's dad.

187
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,953
He was a day trader or something,
he worked by himself.

188
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:15,733
No, I know, I meant...

189
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:17,955
and those weird questions downstairs,

190
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:19,990
what was that?

191
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,896
So you tell me what's going on

192
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:25,654
or I start screaming.

193
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:27,011
All right, all right.

194
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:31,411
We think something happened to Donna's dad.

195
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:32,604
Yeah, a stroke.

196
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:34,756
That's not the sign of a typical stroke.

197
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:38,639
We think it might be something else.

198
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:40,129
Like what?

199
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,743
Honestly,

200
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:43,965
we don't know yet.

201
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:47,193
But we don't want it
to happen to anyone else.

202
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:48,496
That's the truth.

203
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,063
So,

204
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:51,794
if you're gonna scream,

205
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,736
go right ahead.

206
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:57,331
Who are you, cops?

207
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:00,746
Something like that.

208
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,869
I'll tell you what.

209
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:02,781
Here.

210
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:04,477
If you think of anything,

211
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:06,489
you or your friends notice anything strange,

212
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,062
out of the ordinary, just give us a call.

213
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,627
All right, say Bloody Mary really is haunting this town.

214
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,639
There's gonna be some sort of proof

215
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,136
a local woman who died nasty.

216
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,171
Yeah, but a legend
this wide spread, it's hard.

217
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:27,532
I mean, there's like 50 versions
of who she actually is.

218
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:28,690
One story says she's a witch,

219
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:30,866
another says she's a mutilated bride.

220
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,989
There's a lot more.

221
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,720
What are we supposed to be looking for?

222
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,679
Every version's got thingsin common.

223
00:12:35,702 --> 00:12:36,918
It's always a woman named Mary,

224
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,035
and she always dies in front of a mirror.

225
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,251
So we've got to search local newspapers

226
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:43,192
public records as far back as they go,

227
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:45,157
see if we can find a Mary who fits the bill.

228
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:46,888
Well, that sounds annoying.

229
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,689
No, it won't be so bad,

230
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,718
as long as we...

231
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,556
I take it back.

232
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:54,661
This will be very annoying.

233
00:12:57,702 --> 00:13:00,848
I'm not sure. They were cops
or detectives or something.

234
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:03,047
Whoever they were, they were cute.

235
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:03,912
Jill.

236
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:04,989
You didn't think so?

237
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,025
Yeah, okay,they were cute. But,

238
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:10,760
still,do you think something
could have happenedto Donna's dad?

239
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:12,280
Maybe Lily was right.

240
00:13:12,882 --> 00:13:14,730
Maybe Bloody Mary got him.

241
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,665
Very funny.

242
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:19,729
Wait, I'm sorry.

243
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:22,653
Was that fear I hear in your voice?

244
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,033
No.

245
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:26,178
Charlie...

246
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:28,260
I'm walking to the bathroom mirror right now.

247
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:30,295
Jill, quit it.

248
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:34,032
Oh, no,

249
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:35,670
I can't help myself.

250
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:37,822
I'm gonna say it.

251
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:39,857
Bloody Mary.

252
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:42,072
Bloody Mary.

253
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,973
Bloody Mary.

254
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:48,171
Jill?

255
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:53,878
Jill!

256
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,574
You're such a freak.
I'll call you tomorrow.

257
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:57,321
You did it.

258
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:03,695
You killed that boy.

259
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:24,654
Why Sam?

260
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:30,985
Why'd you let me fall asleep?

261
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,207
'Cause I'm an awesome brother.

262
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:36,790
So, what did you dream about?

263
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,387
Lollipops and candy canes.

264
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:42,170
Yeah, sure.

265
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:47,774
You find anything?

266
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,464
Oh, besides a whole new level of frustration?

267
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:53,061
No. I've looked at everything.

268
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:57,615
A few local women, a Laura and a Catherine,

269
00:15:57,638 --> 00:15:59,463
committed suicide in front of a mirror,

270
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:01,935
and a giant mirror fell on a guy named dave.

271
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:02,918
But, uh...

272
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:04,836
No Mary.

273
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:10,824
Maybe we just haven't found it yet.

274
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,192
I've also been searching for strange deaths,

275
00:16:14,276 --> 00:16:15,843
in the area, you know,

276
00:16:16,197 --> 00:16:17,858
eyeball bleeding, that sort of thing.

277
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:19,027
There's nothing.

278
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:21,834
Whatever's happening here,
maybe it just ain't Mary.

279
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:29,039
Hello?

280
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:39,295
And they found her on the bathroom floor.

281
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:43,435
And her-her eyes...

282
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:46,430
they were gone.

283
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:48,161
I'm sorry.

284
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:51,576
And she said it.

285
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,937
I heard her say it.

286
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,152
But it couldn't be because of that.

287
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:02,633
I'm insane, right?

288
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:05,644
No, you're not insane.

289
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:09,457
God, that makes me feel so much worse.

290
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:11,227
Look...

291
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,245
we think something's happening here,

292
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:19,075
something that can't be explained.

293
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:21,244
And we're gonna stop it,

294
00:17:22,437 --> 00:17:23,513
but we could use your help.

295
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:43,578
What did you tell Jill's mom?

296
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,245
I just said I needed some time alone
with Jill's pictures and things.

297
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:46,980
Great.

298
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:48,734
I hate lying to her.

299
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:50,746
This is for the greater good.

300
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:51,775
Hit the lights.

301
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:57,499
What are you guys looking for?

302
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,784
We'll let you know as soon as we find it.

303
00:17:59,854 --> 00:18:01,164
Hey, night vision.

304
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:04,696
Thanks. Perfect.

305
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:09,284
Do I look like Paris Hilton?

306
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:22,700
So, I don't get it.

307
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:25,133
I mean, the first victim didn't summon Mary,

308
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:26,794
and the second victim did.

309
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:28,431
How's she choosing them?

310
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:29,695
Beats me.

311
00:18:34,257 --> 00:18:36,245
I want to know
why Jill said it in the first place.

312
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:38,444
It's just a joke.

313
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:41,688
Somebody's gonna say it again.
It's just a matter of time.

314
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:55,051
Hey.

315
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,897
There's a black light in the trunk, right?

316
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:22,299
Gary Bryman?

317
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:25,163
You know who that is?

318
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,222
No.

319
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:38,202
So, Gary Bryman was an 8 year-old boy.

320
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:41,197
Two years ago,
he was killed in a hit and run.

321
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,121
The car was described
as a black toyota camry,

322
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:47,178
but nobody got the plates or saw the driver.

323
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:48,348
Oh, my god.

324
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:49,915
What?

325
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,763
Jill drove that car.

326
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:56,729
We need to get back
to your friend Donna's house.

327
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,311
Linda shoemaker.

328
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,177
Why are you asking me this?

329
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,567
Look, we're sorry, but it's important.

330
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,321
Yeah.

331
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:18,123
Linda's my mom, okay?

332
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,345
And she overdosed on sleeping pills.

333
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:22,146
It was an accident, and that's it.

334
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:26,437
I think you should leave.

335
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,238
- Donna, just listen
- Get out of my house!

336
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,471
Oh, my god.

337
00:20:34,758 --> 00:20:37,389
Do you really think her dad
could have killed her mom?

338
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,705
Maybe.

339
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:41,698
I think I should stick around.

340
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:44,972
All right. Whatever you do, don't...

341
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,475
Believe me, I won't say it.

342
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:52,978
Wait, wait, wait.

343
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:55,224
You're doing a nationwide search?

344
00:20:55,364 --> 00:20:55,996
Yep.

345
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:58,842
The NCIC, the FBI database

346
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:02,251
any mary in the country who died
in front of a mirror is good enough for me.

347
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,631
But if she's haunting the town,
she should have died in the town.

348
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,714
I'm telling you. There's nothing local.
I check. So, unless you've gota better idea.

349
00:21:08,826 --> 00:21:11,170
Why Mary's choosing a victim?
It seems like there's a pattern.

350
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,412
I know I was thinking the same thing.

351
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:14,496
With mr. Shoemaker and Jill's hit and run

352
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:16,038
both had secrets where people died.

353
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:16,599
Right.

354
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,063
There's a lot of folklore about mirrors

355
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:20,067
that they reveal or your lies,
or your secrets,

356
00:21:20,107 --> 00:21:22,190
that they're a true reflection of your soul,

357
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:23,633
which is why it's bad luck to break them.

358
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:24,575
Right. Right.

359
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:26,811
Yeah, so maybe if you've got a secret,

360
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:28,665
I mean, like a really nasty one
where someone died,

361
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,070
then mary sees it and punishes you for it.

362
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:32,903
Whether you summoned her or not.

363
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:34,768
Take a look at this.

364
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,075
Looks like the same handprint.

365
00:21:49,537 --> 00:21:51,240
Her name was Mary Worthington

366
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:54,287
an unsolved murder in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

367
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:59,298
I was on the job for 35 years,

368
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:00,820
detective for most of that.

369
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,945
Now, everybody packs it in
with a few loose ends,

370
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:05,951
but the Mary Worthington murder...

371
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:09,197
that one still gets me.

372
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:10,599
What exactly happened?

373
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:13,786
You boys said you were reporters.

374
00:22:14,147 --> 00:22:15,709
We know Mary was 19,

375
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:16,954
lived by herself.

376
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:18,897
We know she won a few beauty contests,

377
00:22:18,957 --> 00:22:20,419
dreamt of getting out of Indiana,

378
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,882
being an actress.

379
00:22:22,381 --> 00:22:24,425
And we know, the night of march 29th,

380
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:26,328
someone broke into her apartment

381
00:22:26,468 --> 00:22:27,310
and murdered her,

382
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:29,433
cut out her eyeswith a knife.

383
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:32,039
That's right.

384
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:36,407
See, sir, when we ask you what happened,
we want to know what

385
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:37,568
you think happened.

386
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:44,123
Technically, I'm not supposed
to have a copy of this.

387
00:22:50,273 --> 00:22:50,874
Now,

388
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,538
see that there,

389
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:54,961
"t-r-e"?

390
00:22:55,462 --> 00:22:56,083
Yeah.

391
00:22:56,814 --> 00:22:59,500
I think Mary was trying
to spell out the name of her killer.

392
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:00,562
You know who it was?

393
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:02,005
Not for sure.

394
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,889
But there was a local man,

395
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,851
a surgeon,

396
00:23:06,414 --> 00:23:07,436
Trevor Sampson.

397
00:23:08,157 --> 00:23:10,000
And I think he cut her up good.

398
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:12,539
Now, why would he do something like that?

399
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,263
Her diary mentioned a man she was seeing.

400
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,890
She called him by his initial, "T."

401
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:19,393
Well,

402
00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:21,757
her last entry,

403
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:25,082
she was gonna tell
to his wife about their affair.

404
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,407
But how do you know it was Sampson who killed her?

405
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:29,331
It's hard to say.

406
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:34,902
But the way her eyes were cut out,
it was almost professional.

407
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:37,488
But you could never prove it?

408
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:38,129
No.

409
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,432
No prints,

410
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:40,714
no witnesses.

411
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:42,737
He was meticulous.

412
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,562
Is he still alive?

413
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:47,984
Nope.

414
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:51,910
If you ask me,

415
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:55,276
Mary spent her last living moments

416
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:58,043
trying to expose this guy's secret.

417
00:24:00,187 --> 00:24:01,389
But she never could.

418
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:04,514
Where's she buried?

419
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,862
She wasn't.

420
00:24:07,302 --> 00:24:08,104
She was cremated.

421
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:14,194
What about that mirror?  It's not
in evidence lockup somewhere, is it?

422
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:16,755
No.

423
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,582
It was returned to Mary's family
a long time ago.

424
00:24:22,204 --> 00:24:24,288
You have the names
of her family by any chance?

425
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:31,523
I mean, you bring
these strangers into my house,

426
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:33,086
and they ask me things like that?

427
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:34,428
They were only trying to help.

428
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:36,592
Please, Donna, you have to believe me.

429
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,575
What? About bloody mary?

430
00:24:38,817 --> 00:24:40,941
Please, I know it sounds crazy.

431
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:43,224
"Crazy" doesn't even begin to cover it.

432
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:45,588
I mean, it's one thing
for my sister to believe this crap.

433
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,534
She's 12. But you?

434
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:49,018
Think about the way

435
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:50,720
your dad died,

436
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:53,225
okay, and the way Jill died.

437
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:56,132
Okay, so...

438
00:24:57,274 --> 00:24:57,834
Bloody Mary.

439
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:58,235
No!

440
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:00,178
Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary.

441
00:25:03,145 --> 00:25:05,028
See? Nothing happened.

442
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:06,771
Why would you do that?

443
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:08,294
Oh, my god,

444
00:25:08,895 --> 00:25:10,918
there really is something wrong with you.

445
00:25:22,794 --> 00:25:25,739
Elements that lose electrons become

446
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:27,222
positive ions,

447
00:25:27,763 --> 00:25:30,868
which are smaller than other
atoms of the same element.

448
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:33,933
Therefore, the ionic radius

449
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:36,368
is smaller than the atomic radius

450
00:25:41,602 --> 00:25:42,443
Charlie!

451
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:48,035
Charlie!

452
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,914
Charlie, stop it! What's wrong?
Just calm down!

453
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:00,301
- Charlie!
- Aah! Let me go!

454
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:01,191
Charlie!

455
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,232
Oh, really?

456
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,809
Ah, that's too bad, Mr. Worthington.

457
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,118
I would have paid a lot for that mirror.

458
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:10,398
Okay, well, maybe next time.

459
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,807
All right, thanks.

460
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:12,660
So?

461
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,718
So, that was Mary's brother.

462
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:17,212
The mirror was in the family for years,

463
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:18,603
until he sold it

464
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:19,956
one week ago

465
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,034
to a store called estate antiques,

466
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,028
a store in Toledo.

467
00:26:26,882 --> 00:26:28,922
So wherever the mirror goes,
that's where Mary goes?

468
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,564
Her spirit's definitely
tied up with it somehow.

469
00:26:31,694 --> 00:26:34,679
Isn't there an old superstition
that says mirrors can capture spirits?

470
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:37,452
Yeah, there is.
When someone would die in a house,

471
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:39,992
people would cover up the mirrors
so the ghost wouldn't get trapped.

472
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:42,728
This Mary dies in front of the mirror,
and it draws in her spirit.

473
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:46,002
Yeah, but how could she move
through 100 different mirrors?

474
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:48,181
I don't know but if the mirror is the source,

475
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,739
I say we find it and smash it.

476
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:52,631
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.

477
00:26:56,845 --> 00:26:57,494
Hello?

478
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,663
Charlie?

479
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:19,465
Hey.

480
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:21,431
Hey. It's okay.

481
00:27:22,228 --> 00:27:23,934
You can open up your eyes, Charlie.

482
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:25,742
It's okay, all right?

483
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:27,912
Now, listen.

484
00:27:28,598 --> 00:27:29,896
You're gonna stay right here

485
00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:31,296
on this bed.

486
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:33,345
You're not gonna look at glass

487
00:27:33,512 --> 00:27:35,514
or anything else that has a reflection, okay?

488
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,508
as long as you do that

489
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,752
she cannot get you.

490
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:44,638
But I can't keep that up forever.

491
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:48,965
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

492
00:27:50,874 --> 00:27:51,468
No.

493
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:53,748
No.

494
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:56,715
Not anytime soon.

495
00:27:58,913 --> 00:27:59,951
All right, Charlie,

496
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,694
we need to know what happened.

497
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:03,993
We were in the bathroom.

498
00:28:04,244 --> 00:28:05,134
Donna said it.

499
00:28:05,171 --> 00:28:06,728
That's not what we're talking about.

500
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:11,753
Something happened, didn't it,

501
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:14,182
in your life.

502
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:16,812
A secret...

503
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,307
where someone got hurt?

504
00:28:25,277 --> 00:28:26,603
Can you tell us about it?

505
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,888
I had this boyfriend.

506
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:35,737
I loved him.

507
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:39,848
But he kind of scared me, too, you know?

508
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:41,727
And...

509
00:28:41,982 --> 00:28:42,896
one night

510
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:44,595
at his house,

511
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:46,060
we got in this fight.

512
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,883
Then I broke up with him,

513
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,260
and he got upset and he said

514
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:55,893
he needed me and he loved me.

515
00:28:57,391 --> 00:28:58,346
And he said...

516
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:02,297
"charlie, if you walk out that door
right now, I'm gonna kill myself."

517
00:29:05,164 --> 00:29:06,608
And you know what I said?

518
00:29:08,228 --> 00:29:09,502
I said, "go ahead."

519
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:13,729
And I left.

520
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:18,274
How could I say that?

521
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:25,421
How could I leave him like that?

522
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:29,611
I just...

523
00:29:30,397 --> 00:29:32,309
I didn't believe him, you know?

524
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,378
I should have.

525
00:29:49,503 --> 00:29:52,498
Her boyfriend killing himself,
that's not really Charlie's fault.

526
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:54,536
You know as well as I do,

527
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,298
spirits don't exactly see shades of gray,

528
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:58,147
Dean.

529
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,708
Charlie had a secret,

530
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:00,982
someone died.

531
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:02,681
That's good enough for Mary.

532
00:30:03,488 --> 00:30:04,465
I guess.

533
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:06,334
You know,I've been thinking,

534
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,976
it might not be enough
to just smash that mirror.

535
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:11,633
Why, what do you mean?

536
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:13,226
Mary's hard to pin down, right?

537
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,989
And she moves around from mirror to mirror.

538
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,996
So, who's to say that she's not gonna
just keep hiding in them forever?

539
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:20,608
So maybe...

540
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,412
we should try to pin her down,

541
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:26,732
you know, summon her to her mirror

542
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:28,771
and then smash it.

543
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:30,789
Well, how do you know that's gonna work?

544
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:31,638
I don't,

545
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:33,550
I'm not for sure.

546
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,519
Well, who's gonnasummon her?

547
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:40,068
I will.

548
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:43,466
She'll come after me.

549
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:47,278
All right, you know what? That's it.

550
00:30:57,516 --> 00:30:58,897
This is about Jessica, isn't it?

551
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:04,419
You think that's your dirty little secret,

552
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,267
that you killed her somehow?

553
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:11,678
Sam, this has got to stop, man.

554
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:14,120
I mean,

555
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:15,841
the nightmares and-and

556
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,975
calling her name out
in the middle of the night,

557
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:20,141
it's gonna kill you.

558
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,520
Now, listen to me.

559
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:25,408
It wasn't your fault.

560
00:31:26,882 --> 00:31:29,686
If you want to blame something,
then blame the thing that killed her.

561
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:31,640
Or, hell, why don't you take a swing at me?

562
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:34,167
I'm the one that dragged you
away from her the first place.

563
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,527
I don't blame you.

564
00:31:36,072 --> 00:31:37,367
You shouldn't blame yourself,

565
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:39,427
because there's nothingyou could've done.

566
00:31:39,576 --> 00:31:41,275
- I could've warned her.
- About what?!

567
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,723
You didn't know what was gonna happen.

568
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:46,271
And, besides,

569
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:48,533
all of this isn't a secret.
I mean, I know all about it.

570
00:31:48,544 --> 00:31:50,073
It's not gonna work with Mary anyway.

571
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:51,401
No, you don't.

572
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:53,461
I don't what?

573
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:55,797
You don't know all about it.

574
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:57,942
I haven't told you everything.

575
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,172
What are you talking about?

576
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,145
It wouldn't really be a secret
if I told you, would it?

577
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:12,117
No.

578
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,581
I don't like it.

579
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:16,153
It's not gonna happen. Forget it.

580
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:19,084
Dean, that girl back there is going to die

581
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:21,944
unless we do something about it.

582
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,516
And you know what?

583
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:26,808
Who knows how many more people
are gonna die after that?

584
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:29,357
Now, we're doing this.

585
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:34,380
You've got to let me do this.

586
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,210
Well, that's just great.

587
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,594
All right, let's start looking.

588
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:55,989
Maybe they've already sold it.

589
00:34:01,692 --> 00:34:02,839
I don't think so.

590
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:16,470
That's it.

591
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:20,739
You sure about this?

592
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:38,611
Bloody Mary.

593
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:42,774
Bloody Mary.

594
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,219
Bloody Mary.

595
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,206
I'll go check that out. Stay here. Be careful.

596
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,199
Smash anything that moves.

597
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:23,500
Crap.

598
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:42,834
hold on

599
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,785
Whoa, guys, false alarm.

600
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:47,205
I tripped the system.

601
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:47,918
Who are you?

602
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,042
I'm the boss's kid.

603
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,210
You're Mr. Yamashiro's kid?

604
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,814
Come on.

605
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,261
Come into this one.

606
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,139
It's your fault.

607
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,666
You killed her.

608
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,925
You killed Jessica.

609
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,249
Like I said, I was adopted.

610
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,574
Yeah.

611
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:55,781
You know, I just

612
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:58,030
I really don't have timefor this right now.

613
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:05,637
You never told her the truth,

614
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,900
who you really were.

615
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:09,900
But it's more than that,isn't it?

616
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:12,693
Those nightmares you've been having

617
00:37:13,493 --> 00:37:14,348
of jessica dying,

618
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:16,161
screaming,

619
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:17,738
burning

620
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:20,673
you had them for days before she died.

621
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:22,601
Didn't you?!

622
00:37:25,697 --> 00:37:27,153
You were so desperateto ignore them,

623
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:28,912
to believethey were just dreams.

624
00:37:29,818 --> 00:37:31,258
How could you ignore them like that?

625
00:37:32,073 --> 00:37:34,529
How could you leave her alone to die?

626
00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:38,816
You dreamt it would happen!

627
00:37:45,912 --> 00:37:46,992
Dude.

628
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,223
Sammy, sammy!

629
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,734
It's sam.

630
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,157
God, are you okay?

631
00:37:54,846 --> 00:37:55,717
Uh, yeah.

632
00:37:56,118 --> 00:37:58,453
Come on, come on.

633
00:39:01,658 --> 00:39:03,586
You killed them!

634
00:39:04,146 --> 00:39:05,521
All those people!

635
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:08,242
You killed them!

636
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:37,767
Hey, sam?

637
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:39,463
Yeah?

638
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:44,063
That's got to be like what,
600 years of bad luck?

639
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:09,006
So this is really over?

640
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,789
Yeah, it's over.

641
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:15,038
Thank you.

642
00:40:26,836 --> 00:40:27,987
Charlie?

643
00:40:31,892 --> 00:40:33,116
Your boyfriend's death,

644
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:36,276
you really should try to forgive yourself.

645
00:40:37,364 --> 00:40:38,325
No matter what you did,

646
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:39,773
you probably couldn't have stopped it.

647
00:40:42,285 --> 00:40:43,923
Sometimes bad things just happen.

648
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:56,554
That's good advice.

649
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:13,762
hey, sam?

650
00:41:14,961 --> 00:41:15,666
Yeah?

651
00:41:16,945 --> 00:41:17,905
Now that this is all over,

652
00:41:19,129 --> 00:41:20,658
I want you to tell me what that secret is.

653
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:26,609
Look...

654
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:29,368
You're my brother.

655
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:31,735
And I'd die for you.

656
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:36,920
But there are some things
I need to keep to myself.
