1
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:06,173
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can!

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,716
Now, Dean! Go!

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,219
Mary! No!

4
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,389
Dad is on a hunting trip...

5
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,100
and he hasn't been home
in a few days.

6
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,354
I swore I was done hunting.

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,605
I can't do this alone.

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,108
No!

9
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,987
We've got work to do.

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,657
This is dad's single,
most valuable possession

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,117
everything he knows about
every evil thing, it is in here.

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,411
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off.

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,539
You know, saving people,
hunting things.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,581
Family business.

15
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,458
No.
I gotta find Jessica's killer.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,043
This is the only thing
I can think about.

17
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,087
Sam, you know that
we're gonna find dad, yeah?

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,006
Yeah, I know.

19
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,716
Nervous flyer?

20
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,718
Is it that obvious, huh?

21
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,971
You know what are the odds
of dying in a plane crash?

22
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,390
I mean what,
twenty thousands to one?

23
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:45,480
Oh, it's really reassuring,
thank you.

24
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:11,715
Thanks.

25
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,717
Amanda, how are you today?

26
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,010
I'm doing just fine, Chuck.

27
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,679
Welcome aboard.

28
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,517
15-C towards the back of the plane
on the right. 

29
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,521
Have a nice flight, sir.

30
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,816
Oh, I'm counting on it.

31
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,118
11-F, that's at the middle
of the plane on...

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,994
Thank you.

33
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,206
...the left.

34
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,887
Excuse me. Do you know
how long we have been up?

35
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,181
About forty minutes.

36
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,601
Wow! Time really does fly, huh?

37
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,107
Excuse me.
I've got to stretch my legs.

38
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,093
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

39
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,013
Oh, my god!

40
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:50,999
Morning, sunshine!

41
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,085
What time is it?

42
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,503
Oh, it's about 5:45.

43
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,879
- In the morning?
- Yap.

44
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,381
Where does the day go?

45
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,259
Did you get any sleep last night?

46
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,594
- Yeah, I got a couple of hours.
- You liar.

47
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,222
See, I was up at 3,

48
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
and you were watching
George Foreman informercials.

49
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,184
What can I say?
Riveting TV!

50
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,019
When's the last time
you got a good night sleep?

51
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,397
I don't know. A little while I guess. 
It's not a big deal.

52
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,314
Yeah, it is!

53
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,484
- Okay, I appreciate your concern...
- Oh, I'm not concerned about you.

54
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,987
It's your job to keep my ass alive! 
So I need you sharp.

55
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,407
Seriously you're still having 
nightmares about Jess?

56
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,121
Yeah.

57
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,958
But it's not just her, it's everything.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,254
I just forgot, you know, this job...
man, it gets to you.

59
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,715
Well you can't let it. 
You can't bring it home like that.

60
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,719
So what? 
All this it never keeps you up at night?

61
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,888
Never?!
You never afraid?

62
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,181
No, not really.

63
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,106
That's not fear.

64
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,525
That's precaution.

65
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,195
All right, whatever.
I'm too tired to argue.

66
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,205
- Hallo?
- <i>Dean?

67
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,415
It's huh... It's Jerry Panowski.

68
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,293
<i>You and your dad helped me out
a couple of years back.

69
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,003
Oh, right.

70
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,215
Yeah, up in Kittanning, Pensylvania.
The poltergeist thing.

71
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,217
- It's not back, is it?
- <i>No.

72
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,218
No.

73
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,094
Thank God, no.

74
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:31,099
But it's something else
<i>and I think it could be a lot worse.

75
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:32,601
What is it?

76
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,311
Can we talk in person?

77
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,485
<i>Thanks for making</i>
the trip so quick.

78
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,987
I ought to be doing you guys a favour, 
not the other way around.

79
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,615
Dean and your dad
really helped me out.

80
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,700
Yeah, he told me.
It was a poltergeist?

81
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,369
<i>Poltergeist?
Man, I loved that movie.

82
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,287
Hey, nobody is talking to you,
keep walking.

83
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,083
Damn right it was a poltergeist 
practically it tore our house apart.

84
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,627
I'll tell you something.

85
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,463
If it wasn't for you and your dad
I probably wouldn't be alive.

86
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,300
Your dad said you are off
to college, that's right?

87
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,512
Yeah, I was. I'm...
taking some time off.

88
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,597
He was really proud of you,
I could tell.

89
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,349
He talked about you all the time.

90
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,310
- He did?
- Yeah, you bet he did.

91
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,188
Oh, hey, you know I tried to get
hold of him but I couldn't.

92
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,606
How is he doing anyway?

93
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,694
He is...
wrapped up in a job right now.

94
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,530
Well, we're missing the old man, 
we get a Sam.

95
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,948
Even trade, huh?

96
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,908
No, not by a long shot.

97
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,202
I've got something I want
you guys to hear.

98
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,289
I listened to this.

99
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,916
Well, sounded like
it was appear on?

100
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,002
Normally, I wouldn't have
access to this.

101
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,089
It's the cockpit voice recorder 
for the United Britannian flight 2485.

102
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,299
It was one of ours.

103
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,009
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Repeat!

104
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,304
<i>It's the United Britannian flight 2485...

105
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,681
<i>We wants you to give immediately instructions.
We need help...

106
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,517
<i>United Britannian Flight 2485,
we copy your mayday.

107
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,896
<i>maybe we are experiencing some... 
mechanical failure...

108
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,783
Took off from here...
crashed about two hundred miles up.

109
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,203
Others saying mechanical failure.

110
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,914
Cabin depressurized somehow,
nobody knows why.

111
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:20,501
Over a hundred people onboard, 
only seven we got alive.

112
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,294
The pilot was one.

113
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,713
His name is Chuck Lambert, 
he is a good friend of mine.

114
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,089
Chuck is a...

115
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,094
Well, he's pretty broken up about it. 
Like it was his fault.

116
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,056
- You don't think it was?
- No, I don't.

117
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,975
Jerry, we're gonna need
passenger manifests, 

118
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,435
a list of the survivors...

119
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,480
Right, and a... 
We'll need take a look at the wreckage.

120
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,316
The other stuff is no problem, 
but the wreckage...

121
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,028
Fellows in NTSB has it lockdown 
in an evidence warehouse.

122
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,781
No way I've got that clearance.

123
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:53,784
No problem.

124
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,582
- Hey!
- Hi.

125
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,419
You have been there forever.

126
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,005
You can't rush perfection!

127
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,590
Homeland security?

128
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,593
It's pretty illegal.
Even for us.

129
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,554
Hell, well?
Something new. 

130
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,889
You know, people
have seen it a thousand times.

131
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,562
All right, so what you got?

132
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,898
Well, there is definitely EVP 
on the cockpit voice recorder.

133
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,316
- Yeah?
- Listen.

134
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,780
<i>No survivors!

135
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,783
No survivors?

136
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,786
What's that supposed to mean? 
There were seven survivors.

137
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,288
Got me.

138
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,791
So what you think?
A haunted flight?

139
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,502
There is long history of
spirits and death omens

140
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,880
on planes, on ships
like phantom travelers.

141
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,424
Or, do you remember flight 401?

142
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,925
Right, the one that crasher,

143
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,720
and the airlines salvaged
some of its parts put in other planes.

144
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,264
And the spirits of the pilot and 
co-pilot haunted those parts.

145
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,515
- Right.
- Yeah?

146
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,018
Maybe we've similar deal.

147
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,395
All right, so the survivors. 
Which one we have to talk to first?

148
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,230
Third on the list.
Max Jaffe.

149
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:05,981
Why him?

150
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,524
For one, he lives around here...

151
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:11,320
and two, if anyone saw
anything weird, he did.

152
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,488
What makes you say that?

153
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,698
Oh, I spoke to his mother,

154
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,117
<i>and she told me where we find him.

155
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,581
<i>I don't understand. 
I already spoke with homeland security.

156
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,790
Right.

157
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,417
As new information has come up,

158
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,586
so if you could just answer 
a couple of questions.

159
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:32,382
Just before the plain went down, 
did you notice anything unusual?

160
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,509
Like what?

161
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:37,513
Strange lights,
weird noises maybe?

162
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:38,597
Voices?

163
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,517
No, nothing.

164
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,520
Mister Jaffe... 

165
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,063
- Jaffee.
- Jaffee...

166
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,190
You checked yourself in here, right?

167
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,484
Can I ask why?

168
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,820
I was a little stressed, 
I survived a plain crash.

169
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:58,283
And that's what terrified you?
And that's what you afraid of?

170
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,702
I... I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

171
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,704
I think maybe you did
see something up there.

172
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,790
We need to know what.

173
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,502
No. No, I was delusional.

174
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,295
Seeing things.

175
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,714
He seeing things.

176
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,010
It's okay.

177
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,889
Then just tell us 
what you thought you saw, please.

178
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,188
There was this man.

179
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:33,777
And... he had these... eyes.

180
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:34,862
These...

181
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,407
black eyes.

182
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,286
I saw him...

183
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,205
I thought I saw him...

184
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,293
What?

185
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,881
He opened the emergency exit.

186
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,178
And that's... that's impossible.
Right? I mean, I looked that up.

187
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,598
There is something like 
two tons of pressure on that door.

188
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,517
Yeah.

189
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:09,563
This man, uh, did he seemed 
to appear and disappear?

190
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,316
Rapidly, he would looked
something like a mirage?

191
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,485
What are you, nuts?!

192
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,741
He was a passanger, 
he was sitting right in front of me.

193
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:28,790
So here we are.

194
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,084
George Phelps.
Seat 20-C.

195
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,506
Hm. Man, I don't care 
how strong you are.

196
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,093
Even you hopped up on PCP
or something...

197
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,679
No way you can open up 
an emergency door during the flight.

198
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,599
No, if you're a human.

199
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,810
But maybe this guy, George, 
is something else.

200
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,979
Some kind of a creature maybe,
in human form?

201
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,315
Is this look like 
where a creature's lair to you?

202
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,784
This is your late husband?

203
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,786
Yes, that was my George.

204
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,289
And you said, he was a... dentist?

205
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,919
He was headed to
a convention in Denver.

206
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,882
Do you know, that he was
petrified to fly?

207
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,388
For him to go like that.

208
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,016
How long have you been married?

209
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,311
13 years.

210
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:38,485
And all that time, did you ever noticed 
anything strange about him?

211
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,113
Anything out of ordinary?

212
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,867
Well...

213
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:50,414
He had acid reflux, 
if that's what you mean?

214
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,712
I mean it goes without saying 
it's doesn't make any sense.

215
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:00,799
A middle-aged dentist with an ulcers 
is not exactly evil-personified.

216
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,885
You know what we need to do
is getting inside 

217
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,012
the NTSB warehouse
check out the wreckage.

218
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:07,723
Okay. 

219
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,184
But if we're gonna go down around, 
we better look depart.

220
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,692
Man, I look like
one of the "Blues Brothers".

221
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:19,693
No, you don't.

222
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,113
You look more like a seventh grader 
at his first dance.

223
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:26,992
I hate this thing.

224
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,494
Hey, you want to go in 
that warehouse or not?

225
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,414
What is that?

226
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,917
It's an EMF meter.

227
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,419
It metes electromagnetic frequencies.

228
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,463
Dean, I know what
an EMF meter is,

229
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,466
but why is that it looks like
as a busted up walkman?

230
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,886
That's why I made it out of. 
It's homamade.

231
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,099
Yeah, I can see that.

232
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,085
Check out the emergency door handle.

233
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:08,218
- What is this stuff?
- We are going to find out.

234
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:19,813
Gentlemen.

235
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:21,815
Homeland security?

236
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,902
Why?
One of you two guys isn't enough?

237
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,403
What are you talking about?

238
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,989
Two of your budies went inside 
not 5 minutes ago.

239
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,697
Well, these Mort's suits
do come in handy.

240
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,952
<i>Listen, Chuck.</i>
Let's get back on the horse.

241
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,912
Only in this case, 
it's a little twin engine.

242
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,914
Not even a horse,
more like a pony.

243
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,832
And I'll be right there with you, too.

244
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,126
Anytime you feel
you don't want the wheel, I'll take over.

245
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:26,088
Look, Chuck. 
You don't have to do this today.

246
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,714
I'm not try to rush you.

247
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,301
No... the waiting is worse.

248
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,514
Okay, they fueled up the tank. 
There we go.

249
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,217
This stuff is covered in sulphur.

250
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,302
You sure?

251
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,262
Take a look for yourself.

252
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,016
If you fellas would excuse me, 
I have an idiot to fire.

253
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,603
Hey, Einstein! Hey, you! 

254
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,396
What the hell you doing?!
Put the wrench down!

255
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,233
Yeah, there is
not too many things

256
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,152
that leave behind
sulphuric residue.

257
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,320
Demonic possession?

258
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,654
That would explain how a mortal man

259
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,948
would've the strength to open up
the emergency hatch.

260
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,409
If he got possessed, it's possible.

261
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,827
You know, this goes way beyond

262
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:40,787
floating over a bed,
or barf from pea soup,

263
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,414
it's one thing to possess a person,

264
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,291
but to use him
to take down an entire airplane?

265
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,293
You ever heard
something like this before?

266
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,503
Never.

267
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,718
I'm ready.
Let's do this.

268
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,519
How are you feeling?

269
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:04,520
I feel great.

270
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,688
You'll be back flying jumbos
before you know it.

271
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,190
I hope so.

272
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:12,611
How long we've been up?

273
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,696
Almost forty minutes.

274
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,491
Wow! The time really does fly.

275
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:20,702
What are you doing?!

276
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,855
So... every religion and
every world culture...

277
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,524
has the concept of demons and
demonic possession, right?

278
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,944
Let them christian, native american, 
hindu, you name it.

279
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,654
Yeah but not one described
anything like this.

280
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:56,822
Well that's not exactly true.

281
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,574
You see, according
japanese believes

282
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,909
certain demons are
behind some disasters,

283
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,870
both natural and man made.

284
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,455
One causes earthquake, 
and other causes desease.

285
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,915
And this causes plane crashes?

286
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,212
All right, so what? 

287
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,423
We have a demon
that's evolved with the times,

288
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,300
and found a way to
ratchet up the body count?

289
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:17,801
Yeah.

290
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:22,556
And you know, who knows how many planes 
he's brought down before this one.

291
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,020
What?

292
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,065
I don't know, 
I mean this is not a normal gig.

293
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,775
I mean, demons,
they don't want anything,

294
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,903
just death and destruction
for their own sake.

295
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,280
This is big.

296
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,407
I wish that dad was here.

297
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,784
Yeah, me too.

298
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,751
- Hello?
- <i>Dean, it's Jerry.

299
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,086
- Oh, hi, Jerry.
- <i>My pilot friend...

300
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,298
Chuck Lambert is dead.

301
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,302
Jerry, I'm sorry.
What happened?

302
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,471
<i>He and his buddy went up
in a small twin,

303
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:05,098
but an hour ago
<i> the plain went down.

304
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:06,308
Where this happened?

305
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,810
That's 60 miles west of here,
in Nazareth.

306
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,687
I will try to ignore the irony in that.

307
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:11,522
<i>Sorry?

308
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,397
Nothing.

309
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,067
Jerry, hang on there. 
I will catch up with you soon.

310
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,487
- Another crash?
- Yeah.

311
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,280
- Let's go.
- Where?

312
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:21,698
Nazareth.

313
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:34,419
Sulphur?

314
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,382
Oh, that's great.

315
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,885
All right, so there're two 
plane crashes involving Chuck Lambert.

316
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,012
This demon sounds like
goes after him.

317
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,639
Whit all respect to Chuck,

318
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:48,600
if that's the case,
that would be a good news.

319
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:49,810
What's the bad news?

320
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,563
Chuck's plane went down 
exactly forty minutes on the fly.

321
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,482
And get this,
so the flight 2485.

322
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,609
40 minutes?
What is that mean?

323
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,611
It's biblical numerology.

324
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,572
You know, Noah's ark, 
it rained for forty days.

325
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:02,781
That number means death.

326
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:06,577
I went back and there were six
plane crashes over the last decade

327
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,496
that all went down exactly forty minutes on.

328
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,415
Any survivors?

329
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:16,920
No. Or it not until now at least, 
until 2485 for some reason.

330
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,799
On the cockpit voice recorder
remember what the evp said?

331
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,009
No survivors.

332
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:27,389
It's going after all the survivors.

333
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,766
It should finish the job.

334
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,479
Really? 

335
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,190
Well, we thank you taking our survey

336
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:37,649
and if you do plan a flight 

337
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,903
please don't forget your friends
at United Britannia Airlines.

338
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:41,987
Thanks.

339
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:45,574
All right. That takes care of
Blane Sanderson and Dennis Holloway.

340
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,201
They're not flying any time soon.

341
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,620
So the only wild card is
the fly attendant, Amanda Walker.

342
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,831
Right. Her sister Karen said
her flight leaves in Minneapolis at 8pm,

343
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,499
that's her first night back on the job.

344
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,709
It sounds like we just our luck.

345
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,921
Dean, this is an 5 hour drive, man. 
Even with you by the wheel.

346
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,256
Why don't you call
Amanda's cellphone again, 

347
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:02,508
see if we can head her off the pass.

348
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,719
I already left her three voice messages, 
she just turned her cellphone off.

349
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,890
- God! We never gonna make it.
- We'll make it.

350
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,989
Right there.
It will boarding in thirty minutes.

351
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:29,785
Okay, we still left some cards to play. 
We gonna need find a phone.

352
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:33,914
<i>Airport services.

353
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,083
- I'm at gate 13.
- <i>Who you wanna call, sir?

354
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,626
I'm trying contact with
an Amanda Walker,

355
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:41,213
she is a flight attendant on
a flight hm... flight 424.

356
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,381
<i> Amanda Walker.

357
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:46,510
<i>Amanda Walker, you have
a phone call flight crew six from gate 13.

358
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,097
Come on!

359
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,016
This is Amanda Walker.

360
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:54,560
<i>Miss Walker?

361
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:58,605
<i>Hi, this is Dr. James Hetfield from
<i>St. </i>Francis Memorial Hospital.

362
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:01,650
- We have a Karen Walker here.
- My Karen?!

363
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:05,320
<i> Nothing serious just a minor car accident, 
</i> but she was injured <i> so...

364
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,906
Wait, wait, that's impossible. 
I just got off the phone with her.

365
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,495
- You what?
- <i>Five minutes ago.

366
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,873
She's at her house cramming
for a final...

367
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:16,999
Who is this?

368
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:21,003
That's must be some mistake.

369
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,629
<i>How would do you even know
I was here?

370
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,091
Is this one of Vince's friends?

371
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:28,719
Guilties charged.

372
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,805
This is unbelievable!

373
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:34,391
He is really sorry.

374
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,518
<i> Well, you tell him
to mind his own business</i>

375
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,061
and stay out of my life. Okay?

376
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:41,398
Yes. But, he really needs
to see you tonight.

377
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,109
- So...
- No, I'm sorry, it's too late.

378
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:48,780
Don't be like that! Come on,
the guy's a mess, really, a pathetic.

379
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:50,657
Really?

380
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:51,783
Oh, yeah!

381
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:55,913
<i> Look, I gotta go... </i> 
tell him to call me when I landed.

382
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,748
<i> No, no, wait, Amanda...</i>
Amanda!

383
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,297
How are you?

384
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:07,508
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey.

385
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,391
Damn it!

386
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,393
So close!

387
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,689
All right, it's time for plan B.

388
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:24,316
We're getting on that plane.

389
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,859
Just hold on a second.

390
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:29,446
Dean, that plane is leaving with over
a hundred passengers on board,

391
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:32,366
and if we're right,
that plane is gonna crash.

392
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:33,116
I know!

393
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,578
Okay. Then we're getting on that plane, 
we need to find that demon and exorcise it.

394
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,830
Look, I'll get the tickets, you just go
get whatever you can out of the trunk,

395
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,040
whatever will make it through security,

396
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:41,291
meet me back here in 5 minutes.

397
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:44,503
Are you okay?

398
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,298
No, not really.

399
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:50,509
Why? What's wrong?

400
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,888
I kind of have this problem with... 

401
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:57,516
Flying?

402
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,810
It's never been an issue until now.

403
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:00,978
Are you joking, right?

404
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,187
Do I look like I'm joking?!

405
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,691
Why do you think 
I drive everywhere, Sam?!

406
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:08,652
All right. I'll go.

407
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:10,320
- What?
- I'll do this one my own.

408
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:12,030
Are you nuts?!

409
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,448
You said yourself
that's plane gonna crash!

410
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,409
Look, Dean, we can do it together, 
I can do this one by myself,

411
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:16,785
I'm not seeing a third option here.

412
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,996
Come on!

413
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:21,790
Really?

414
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,710
Man...

415
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:39,683
- Just try to relax.
- Just try to shut up!

416
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:11,381
- Are you humming Metallica?
- Calms me down.

417
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:17,387
Look, man, I get you're nervous, all right? 
But you got to stay focused.

418
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:19,515
Okay.

419
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:22,017
I mean, we got 32 minutes
and counting

420
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:25,103
to track this thing down
or whoever it's possessing anyway

421
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:26,813
and perform a full exorcism.

422
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:28,607
Yeah, on a crowded airplane
that's gonna be easy.

423
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,692
Just take one step at a time, all right?

424
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,780
Now... who is it possessing?

425
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:38,700
Well, it's usually gonna be somebody
with some sort of weakness you know,

426
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:41,036
a chink in the armor
that the demon can worm through. 

427
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,789
Somebody with an addiction,
or some sort of emotional distress.

428
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,377
Well this is Amanda's first flight
after the crash, 

429
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,420
if I were her I'd be messed up.

430
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,050
Excuse me.
Are you Amanda?

431
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,301
No, I'm not.

432
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:57,719
Oh, my mistake.

433
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:07,688
All right, well, it's got to be Amanda back there,
so I could talk to her.

434
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,023
And uh...
I'll get a read on her mental state.

435
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,692
What if she is already possessed?

436
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,403
There is a way to test that.

437
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:17,865
I brought holy water.

438
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,701
No.
I think we can go more settled.

439
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,412
If she's possessed, 
she'll flinch at the name of God.

440
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:24,830
Uh, nice.

441
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:27,332
Hey?

442
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,585
- What?
- Say it in latin.

443
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:30,794
I know!

444
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:31,920
Hey?

445
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:35,257
- What?!
- In latin it's <i>Christo</i>.

446
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:36,884
Dude, I know! I'm not an idiot!

447
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:48,020
<i>Ladies and gentlemen 
this is the first officer speak...

448
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:51,398
- Hi.
- Hi.

449
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:56,195
- Can I help you in something?
- Oh, no. I'm just a bit of an uneasy flier.

450
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,697
Makes me feel better 
to walk around a little bit.

451
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,282
Oh, it happens with the best of us.

452
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:04,411
Of course, you being a stewardess,
I guess flying comes easy to you.

453
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:06,580
Oh, you'd be surprised.

454
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:08,916
Really? You...
you're a nervous flyer?

455
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,418
Yeah, maybe. A little bit.

456
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,714
How is it though being a stewardes
you're scared to fly?

457
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,008
Kind of a long story.

458
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:20,719
All right, I'm sorry for asking.

459
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:22,095
Okay.

460
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,598
You never considered
other employment?

461
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:26,642
No.

462
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:32,689
Look, everybody scared of something.
I just... I'm not gonna let it hold me back.

463
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:40,113
<i>Christo</i>.

464
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:43,116
I'm sorry, did you say something?

465
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,789
<i>Christo</i>?

466
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:52,000
I didn't... I didn't...

467
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,211
Oh, nothing, never mind.

468
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:58,799
Okay.

469
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:09,351
All right, she is gotta be the most
well-adjusted person on the planet.

470
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:10,143
You said <i>Christo</i>?

471
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:11,061
- Yeah.
- And?

472
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:13,313
There is no demon in her. 
There is no demon getting in her.

473
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:16,316
So it is on the plane
could be anyone, anywhere.

474
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:18,861
Come on, that can be normal?!

475
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,904
Hey! Hey... just a little turbulance.

476
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:25,200
Sam, this plane is going to crash, okay?
So quit treating me like I'm freaking fool!

477
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,160
- You need to calm down.
- Well, I'm sorry I can't!

478
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,412
Yes, you can.

479
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:32,624
Dude, stow the touchy-feely,
self-help-yoga crap. It's not helping!

480
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,418
Listen, you're panicked, 
you're wide open to demonic possession,

481
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:37,421
so you need to calm yourself down,
right now.

482
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:47,014
Good.

483
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:52,019
Now, I found an exorcism in here
that I think is gonna work.

484
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:54,146
The Rituale Romanum.

485
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:56,356
What we have to do?

486
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:59,943
It's two parts. The first part is
spells the demon from the victim's body

487
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,988
and makes it manifest 
which actually makes him more powerful.

488
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:04,239
- More powerful?
- Yeah.

489
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:05,115
How?

490
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:07,242
Well, it doesn't need to
possess someone anymore,

491
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:08,911
it can just break out and go on it's own.

492
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:10,913
Oh, and why is that a good thing?

493
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,792
Well, because the second part
sends the bastard back to hell.

494
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,294
Once and for all.

495
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,589
First things first we gotta find it.

496
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,711
- Man! Don't do that!
- Anything?

497
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,713
No, nothing,
how much time we got?

498
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:03,090
15 minutes.

499
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:05,384
Maybe we missed somebody.

500
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:07,886
Maybe the thing is
just not on the plane.

501
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,180
You believe that?

502
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,307
Well, I will, if you will.

503
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:22,609
What is it?!

504
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:24,695
<i>Christo</i>!

505
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:40,961
She is not gonna believe this.

506
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:42,421
12 minutes, dude!

507
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:45,382
Oh, hi!

508
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:47,676
The flight's not too bumpy for you I hope.

509
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,803
Actually that's kind of
what we need to talk to you about.

510
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:52,097
Okay. What can I do for you?

511
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:53,974
This is going to sound nuts, but...

512
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,019
we just don't have time for
"The Truth is Out There" speach right now...

513
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,896
Look, we know
you were on the flight 2485.

514
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,607
Who are you guys?

515
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,442
Now, we spoken
some of the other survivors,

516
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,152
and we know something
brought down that plane,

517
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:06,570
and it wasn't mechanical failure.

518
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:07,446
We need your help,

519
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,990
because we need to stop
from happening again, here, now.

520
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:12,284
I'm sorry...
I'm very busy, I have to go back...

521
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:13,160
Wait, wait a second.

522
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:14,620
We will not hurt you, okay?

523
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:18,498
But listen to me.
The pilot on 2485, Chuck Lambert,

524
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:19,708
he is dead.

525
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:21,460
What?!

526
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:22,711
Chuck is dead?

527
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:26,173
He died in a plane crach.
And that's two plane crashes in two months.

528
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:27,799
That doesn't strike you a little strange?

529
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:31,595
Look, there was something wrong with 2485 
now maybe you sensed it, maybe you didn't,

530
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,305
but there's something wrong
with this flight, too.

531
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:34,515
Mandy, you have to believe us.

532
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:45,692
On 2485 there was this man...

533
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,028
he have this eyes...

534
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,613
Yes, that's exactly
what we're talking about!

535
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,573
I don't understand 
what are you asking me to do?!

536
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:53,200
Get the co-pilot, 
we need you to bring him back here.

537
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:55,118
Why?
What does he have to do with anything?

538
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,913
We don't have time to explain, 
we just need to talk to him, okay?

539
00:33:57,996 --> 00:33:59,957
How am I supposed to going to
the cockpit and get the co-pilot...

540
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:02,751
Whatever it takes! Do whatever it takes,
just tell that something's broken back here,

541
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,253
whatever that'll get him out of that cockpit.

542
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,004
You know that I can lose my job?

543
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,298
You'll lose lot more than that
if you don't help us out!

544
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:15,514
Okay.

545
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,513
Now what's the problem?

546
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,480
Wait, what are you doing with him? 
You said you just wanna talk to him!

547
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,690
We are gonna talk to him!

548
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:13,572
No!

549
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:17,242
Oh my God!
What's wrong with him?

550
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:18,535
Look, we need you to calm down, 

551
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:21,371
we need you outside of the curtain.
Don't let anybody in, okay?

552
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:22,414
Can you do that?

553
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,082
Amanda?

554
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,209
Okay. Okay.

555
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,047
Hurry up, Sam. I don't know
how much longer I can hold him.

556
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:35,469
<i>Regna terrae cantate Deo:
psallite Domino...

557
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:39,014
<i>qui vehitur per caelus, 
caelos antiquos...

558
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,231
Okay, I get him!

559
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:51,235
<i>Ecce, edit vocem suam, vocem potentem
Agnoscite potentiam Dei!

560
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:53,487
<i>I know what happened to your girlfriend!

561
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:56,907
<i>She must have died screaming!

562
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:59,493
<i>Even now, she burns!

563
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:02,913
Sam!

564
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:10,087
<i>...et potentia ejus in nubibus.

565
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:11,004
I got him!

566
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,610
- Where it go?
- It's on the plane.

567
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,112
Hurry up!
We gotta finish it!

568
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:51,753
Nooo!

569
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:15,777
<i>Timendus est Deus e sancto suo...

570
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,826
<i>ipse potentiam dat et...

571
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:24,661
<i>Gloria Patri.

572
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,845
<i>You sure you can't tell me
what happened?

573
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:26,181
I don't know. I was working at the airport, 
then it all goes blank.

574
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:28,308
I don't even know how I get on that plane.

575
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,520
Anything else?

576
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:33,313
No, that's all.

577
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:38,110
<i>Thank you.

578
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,409
Let's get out of here.

579
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,121
Are you okay?

580
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:51,415
Dean.

581
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,419
It knew about Jessica.

582
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:01,300
Sam, these things, they read minds. 
They lie.

583
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,093
All right? Thats all it was.

584
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:05,721
Yeah.

585
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:08,891
Come on.

586
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:17,107
Nobody knows
what you guys did, but I do.

587
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,194
Lot of people could have been killed.

588
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,488
Your dad is gonna be real proud.

589
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,990
I'll see you around, Jerry.

590
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,120
- Hey, Jerry!
- Yeah?

591
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:33,457
I wanted to ask you, how did you get
my cellphone number anyway? 

592
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,167
I only have it from like six months.

593
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,585
Your dad gave it to me.

594
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:38,921
- What?
- When did you talk to him?

595
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:41,006
Well, I didn't exactly talked to him but... 

596
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:45,302
I called his number, his voice message
said to give you a call.

597
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:48,180
Thanks again, guys.

598
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,198
This doesn't make any sense, man.

599
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:09,284
I called dad's number like fifty times.
It's been out of service.

600
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,413
<i>This is John Winchester.
I can't be reached.

601
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:16,208
<i>If this is an emergency,
call my son, Dean.

602
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:23,715
<i>866-907-3235.
He can help.
