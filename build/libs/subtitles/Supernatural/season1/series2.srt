1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,490
Take your brother outside as fast as you can!
Now Dean! Go!

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,970
Mary!
No!

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,090
Dad's on a hunting trip.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,910
And he hasn't been home in a few days.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,280
Jess excuse us.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,070
I swore I was done hunting,

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,350
for good.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,260
I can't do this alone.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,300
Now you're taking off the middle of the
night to spend the week-end with them.

10
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:32,690
Hey, everything's gonna be OK.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,950
I promise.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,100
You think mom would have wanted this for us?

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,960
Dean, we were raised like warriors.

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,970
- You have a responsability.
- To dad and his cruisade.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,360
Even if you do find the thing that killed her, mom's gone

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,810
and she isn't coming back.

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,370
Don't talk about her like that.

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,380
Dad's gone.

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,010
I've got his journal. He left me a message.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,220
It's coordinates he left us. It's weird, man.

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,870
Hey, Dean,

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,890
what I said earlier,

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,260
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,170
No chick-flick moments.

25
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,860
Yes.

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,830
No!

27
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,860
We got work to do.

28
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,010
Dude, you're cheating.

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,400
No, you just suck.

30
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,760
Hey, Hailey. Day six. We're still
out near Black Water Ridge.

31
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:20,130
We're fine, keeping safe,
so don't worry. Talk to you tomorrow.

32
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,340
Hey, where you going?
My moment of victory.

33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,940
Nature calls.

34
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,290
Brad?

35
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,440
Gary, what's going on?

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,560
I am, um...

37
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,460
You always said roses were lame, so,
I brought you, uh...

38
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,120
Jess...

39
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,370
Oh, god.

40
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,500
I should have protected you.

41
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,430
I should have told you the truth.

42
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,770
You okay?

43
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,430
Yeah, I'm fine.

44
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,620
Another nightmare?

45
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,970
Want to drive for a while?

46
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,440
In your whole life,
you never once asked me that.

47
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,230
Just thought you might want to.
Never mind.

48
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,980
Look, man,

49
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,750
you're worried about me.
I get it, and...

50
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,490
thank you, but I'm perfectly okay.

51
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,760
All right. Where are we?

52
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,730
We are just outside of Grand Junction.

53
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,960
You know what? Maybe we shouldn't
have left Stanford so soon.

54
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,880
Sam, we dug around there for
a week. We came up with nothing.

55
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,840
- If you want to find the thing that killed Jessica...
- Got to find dad first.

56
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,690
Dad disappearing, and this thing showing up
again after 20 years?

57
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,700
It's no coincidence.

58
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,370
- Dad will have answers. He'll know what to do.
- It's weird, man.

59
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,010
These coordinates he left us,
this Black Water Ridge...

60
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,510
- What about it?
- There's nothing there.

61
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,480
It's just woods.

62
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,840
Why is he sending us
to the middle of nowhere?

63
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,730
So Black Water Ridge
is pretty remote.

64
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,070
It's cut off by these canyons here -rough terrain, dense forest,

65
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:54,480
abandoned silver and gold mines all over the place...

66
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,760
Dude, check out the size
of this friggin' bear.

67
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,700
...And a dozen or more
grizzlies in the area.

68
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,390
It's no nature hike,
that's for sure.

69
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,360
You boys aren't planning to go out near
Black Water Ridge, by any chance?

70
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,540
Oh, no, sir. We're environmental-study majors
from U.C. Boulder- just working on a paper.

71
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,120
Recycle, man.

72
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,510
Bull.

73
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,960
You're friends with that Hailey girl, right?

74
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,830
Yes.

75
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,750
Yes, we are.

76
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,200
Ranger... Wilkinson.

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,105
Well, I will tell you exactly what I told her.

78
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,340
Her brother filled out a backcountry permit saying
he wouldn't be back from Black Water until the 24th.

79
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,890
So it's not exactly a missing persons now, is it?

80
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,440
Tell that girl to quit worrying.
I'm sure her brother's just fine.

81
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,870
We will.

82
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,590
Well, that Hailey girl's
quite a pistol, huh?

83
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,360
That is putting it mildly.

84
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,750
Actually, you know what would help is if I could
show her a copy of that backcountry permit.

85
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:56,300
You know, so she could see her brother's return date.

86
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,930
Yeah.
Heh heh.

87
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,800
What, are you cruising
for a hookup or something?

88
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,580
What do you mean?

89
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,130
The coordinates point to Black Water Ridge.
So what are we waiting for?

90
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:08,510
Let's just go find dad. Why even talk to this girl?

91
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,660
I don't know, maybe we should know what we're
walking into before we actually walk into it.

92
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,450
What?

93
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,700
Since when are you all "shoot first,
ask questions later" anyway?

94
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,320
Since now.

95
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,640
Oh, really?

96
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,550
You must be Hailey Collins.

97
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,530
I'm Dean, this is Sam. We're rangers with the park service.
Ranger Wilkinson sent us over.

98
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:35,090
We wanted to ask you
some questions about your brother Tommy.

99
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,750
Let me see some I.D.

100
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,740
There you go.

101
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,900
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

102
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,890
That yours?

103
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,670
Yeah.

104
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,870
Nice car.

105
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,290
So, if Tommy's not due back for a while,
how do you know something's wrong?

106
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,580
He checks in every day by cell. He e-mails
photos, stupid little videos.

107
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,000
But we haven't heard anything
in over three days now.

108
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,120
Well, maybe he can't get cell reception.

109
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,030
He's got a satellite phone, too.

110
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,890
- Could it be he's just having fun and forgot to check in?
- He wouldn't do that.

111
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,120
Our parents are gone.
It's just my two brothers and me.

112
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,530
We all keep pretty close tabs on each other.

113
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,820
- Can I see the pictures he sent you?
- Yeah.

114
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,050
That's Tommy.

115
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,015
Hey, Hailey. Day six.
We're still out near Black Water Ridge.

116
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,900
We're fine, keeping safe, so don't worry, okay?
Talk to you tomorrow.

117
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,630
We'll find your brother. We're heading out
to Black Water Ridge first thing.

118
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:51,040
Then maybe I'll see you there.

119
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,780
Look.

120
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,740
I can't sit around here anymore,

121
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,680
so I hired a guide. I'm heading out in the morning,
and I'm gonna find Tommy myself.

122
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,600
I think I know how you feel.

123
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,880
Hey, you mind forwarding these to me?

124
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,060
Sure.

125
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,995
So, Black Water Ridge doesn't get
a lot of traffic- local campers mostly-

126
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,840
but, still, this past april, two hikers went
missing out there. They were never found.

127
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,160
Any before that?

128
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,830
Yeah.

129
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,790
In 1982, eight different people
all vanished in the same year.

130
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,875
Authorities said it was a grizzly attack.

131
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,910
And, again, in 1959, and again,
before that, in 1936.

132
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,150
Every 23 years, just like clockwork.

133
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,040
Okay, watch this.

134
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,810
Here's the clincher.

135
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,390
I downloaded that guy Tommy's video to the laptop.
Check this out.

136
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,110
Do it again.

137
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,220
That's three frames. It's a fraction of a second.
Whatever that thing is, it can move.

138
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,390
I told you something weird was going on.

139
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,250
Yeah. I got one more thing.

140
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,110
In '59, one camper survived the supposed
grizzly attack, just a kid

141
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,310
barely crawled
out of the woods alive.

142
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,990
Is there a name?

143
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,440
Look, ranger, I don't know why
you're asking me about this.

144
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,310
It's public record.
I was a kid.

145
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,760
- My parents got mauled by a...
- grizzly?

146
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,380
That's what attacked them?

147
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,520
The other people that went missing that year,

148
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,670
those bear attacks, too?

149
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,230
What about all the people
that went missing this year?

150
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,460
Same thing?

151
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,470
If we knew what we were dealing with,
we might be able to stop it.

152
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,850
I seriously doubt that.

153
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,280
Anyways,

154
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,800
I don't see the difference it would make.

155
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,830
You wouldn't believe me.

156
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,280
Nobody ever did.

157
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,340
Mr. Shaw...

158
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,100
...what did you see?

159
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,890
Nothing.

160
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,530
It moved too fast to see.

161
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,120
It hid too well.

162
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,660
I heard it, though.

163
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,130
A roar...

164
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,670
...like...

165
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,180
no man or animal I ever heard.

166
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,190
It came at night?

167
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,660
Got inside your tent?

168
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,360
It got inside our cabin.

169
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,860
I was sleeping in front of
the fireplace when it came in.

170
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,450
It didn't smash a window
or break the door,

171
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,010
it unlocked it.

172
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,470
Do you know of a bear that
could do something like that?

173
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,790
I didn't even wake up until
I heard my parents screaming.

174
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,110
It killed them?

175
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,430
Dragged them off into the night.

176
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,990
Why it left me alive -I've been asking myself that ever since.

177
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,350
It did leave me this, though.

178
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,640
There's something evil in those woods.

179
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,580
It was some sort of a demon.

180
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,420
Spirits and demons don't have to unlock doors.
They just go through the walls.

181
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:41,310
So it's probably something
else - something corporeal.

182
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,480
"Corporeal"?

183
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,940
Excuse me, professor.

184
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,870
Shut up. So, what do you think?

185
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,720
The claws, the speed that it moves.

186
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,100
It could be a skinwalker,
maybe a black dog

187
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,700
Whatever we're talking about, we're talking
about a creature, and it's corporeal,

188
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,870
which means we can kill it.

189
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,520
We cannot let that Hailey girl go out there.

190
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,210
Oh yeah, what are we gonna tell her she can't go
into the woods because of a big, scary monster?

191
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:22,130
Yeah.

192
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,130
Her brother's missing, Sam.

193
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,970
She's not just gonna sit this out.

194
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,290
No, we go with her, we protect her, and we keep
our eyes peeled for our fuzzy predator friend

195
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,230
So finding dad's not enough?

196
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,660
Now we got to babysit, too?

197
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,280
What?

198
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,520
Nothing.

199
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,280
I'll tell you again.
I don't think ben should come.

200
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,020
Roy...

201
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,050
Look, you're paying me good money to keep
everybody safe. I think Ben's safest at home.

202
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,500
You guys got room for two more?

203
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,290
You want to come with us?

204
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,240
Who are these guys?

205
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,520
Apparently, this is all the park service could muster up.

206
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,840
You're rangers?

207
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,690
That's right.

208
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,790
And you're hiking out
in biker boots and jeans?

209
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,560
Well, sweet heart, I don't do shorts.

210
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,680
Oh, you think this is funny? It's dangerous
backcountry out there. Her brother might be hurt.

211
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,420
Believe me, I know how dangerous it can be.

212
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,330
We just want to help them find their brother.
That's all.

213
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,770
Roy, you said you did a little hunting.

214
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,940
Yeah, more than a little.

215
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,420
What kind of furry critters do you hunt?

216
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,960
Mostly buck. Sometimes bear.

217
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,800
Tell me, uh, Bambi or Yogi ever hunt you back?

218
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,810
What you doing, Roy?

219
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,100
You should watch where you're stepping... ranger.

220
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,880
It's a bear trap.

221
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,950
You didn't pack any provisions.

222
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,810
You guys are carrying a duffel bag.

223
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,870
You're not rangers, so who the hell are you?

224
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,970
Sam and I are brothers,

225
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,820
and we're looking for our father.

226
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,390
He might be here. We don't know.

227
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,380
I just figured that you and me, we're in the same boat.

228
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,470
- Why didn't you just tell me that from the start?
- I'm telling you now.

229
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,900
Besides, it's probably the most honest
I've ever been with a woman...

230
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,640
ever.

231
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,270
So, we okay?

232
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,860
Yeah, okay.

233
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,600
And what do you mean I didn't pack provisions?

234
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,130
This is it.

235
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,680
Black Water Ridge.

236
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,530
What coordinates are we at?

237
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,470
35 and minus 111.

238
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,560
You hear that?

239
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,730
Yeah.

240
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,960
Not even crickets.

241
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,520
I'm gonna go take a look around.

242
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,050
You shouldn't go off by yourself.

243
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,470
That's sweet. Don't worry about me.

244
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,970
All right, everybody stays together.
Let's go.

245
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,270
Hailey! Over here!

246
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,850
Oh, my god.

247
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,920
Looks like a grizzly.

248
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,030
Tommy?

249
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,820
Tommy!

250
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,680
- Tommy!
- Shh... Shh...

251
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,360
Why?

252
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,340
Something might still be out there.

253
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,180
Sam.

254
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,850
The bodies were dragged from the campsite.

255
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,900
But here, the tracks just vanish.

256
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,850
It's weird.

257
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,090
I tell you what.

258
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,990
It's no skinwalker or black dog.

259
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,410
Hey, he could still be alive.

260
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,220
Help!

261
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,600
It seemed like it was coming from around here, didn't it?

262
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,450
Everybody back to camp.

263
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,740
Our packs!

264
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,270
So much for my GPS and my satellite phone.

265
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,690
What the hell's going on?

266
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,850
It's smart.

267
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,270
It wants to cut us off so we can't call for help.

268
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,440
You mean someone -some nut job out there just stole all our gear.

269
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,760
I need to speak with you... in private.

270
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,740
Okay, let me see dad's journal.

271
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,180
All right.

272
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,050
Check that out.

273
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,350
Oh, come on.

274
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,270
Windigos are in the Minnesota woods or Northern
Michigan. I've never even heard of one this far west.

275
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:07,140
Think about it, Dean - the claws, the way it can mimic a human voice.

276
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,440
Great.

277
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,000
Well, then this is useless.

278
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,630
We got to get these people to safety.

279
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,300
All right, listen up. It's time to go.

280
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,990
Things have gotten more complicated.

281
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:26,970
What?

282
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,480
Whatever's out there, I think I can handle it.

283
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,930
If you shoot this thing, you're just gonna make it mad.
We have to leave now.

284
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,830
One, you're talking nonsense, two,
you're in no position to give anybody orders.

285
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:37,980
Relax.

286
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,600
We never should have let you
come out in the first place, all right?

287
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,640
I'm trying to protect you.

288
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,760
You protect me?

289
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,020
I was hunting these woods when your mommy
was still kissing you good night.

290
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:45,790
Yeah.

291
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,530
It's a damn-near-perfect hunter.

292
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,660
It's smarter than you.

293
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,310
And it's gonna hunt you down and eat you alive
unless we get your stupid sorry ass out of here.

294
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,220
- You know you're crazy, right?
- Yeah?

295
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,900
You ever hunt - chill out.

296
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,980
Stop! Stop it. Everybody just stop.

297
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,560
Look.

298
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,160
Tommy might still be alive.

299
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,110
And I'm not leaving here without him.

300
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,430
It's getting late.

301
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,830
This thing is a good hunter in the day,

302
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,690
but an unbelievable hunter at night.

303
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,340
We'll never beat it -not in the dark.

304
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,570
We need to settle inand protect ourselves.

305
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,230
How?

306
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,460
- One more time. That's...?
- Anasazi symbols.

307
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,200
It's for protection.
The windigo can't cross over them.

308
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,480
Nobody likes a skeptic, Roy.

309
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,520
You want to tell me what's going on
in that freaky head of yours?

310
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,180
- Dean...
- No, you're not fine.

311
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,260
You're like a powder keg, man. It's not like you.

312
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,500
I'm supposed to be the belligerent one, remember?

313
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,030
Dad's not here.

314
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,660
I mean, that much we know for sure, right?
He would have left us a message, a sign, right?

315
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,260
Yeah, you're probably right.

316
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,220
To tell you the truth, I don't think
dad's ever been to Lost Creek.

317
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,150
Then let's get these people back to town,
and let's hit the road...

318
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:45,000
Go find dad. I mean, why are we still even here?

319
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,780
This is why...

320
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,980
This book.

321
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,490
This is dad's single most valuable possession.
Everything he knows about every evil thing is in here.

322
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,770
And he's passed it on to us.

323
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,260
I think he wants us to pick up where he left off.

324
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,960
You know, saving people, hunting things...

325
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,390
The family business.

326
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,250
That makes no sense.

327
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,300
Why- why doesn't he just call us? Why doesn't
he tell us what he wants, tell us where he is?

328
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,100
I don't know.

329
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,210
But the way I see it,

330
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,620
dad's given us a job to do, and I intend to do it.

331
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,250
Dean...

332
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,810
no.

333
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,470
I gotta find dad.

334
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,180
I gotta find Jessica's killer.

335
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:54,920
- It's the only thing I can think about.
- Okay. All right. Sam, we'll find them. I promise.

336
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,330
Listen to me.

337
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,550
You've got to prepare yourself.

338
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,520
I mean, this search could take a while.

339
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,890
And all that anger,

340
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,530
you can't keep it burning over the long haul.
It's gonna kill you.

341
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,370
You got to have patience, man.

342
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,360
How do you do it?

343
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,280
How does dad do it?

344
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,840
Well, for one, them.

345
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:26,590
I mean, I figure our family's so screwed to hell,
maybe we can help some others.

346
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,070
It makes things a little bit more bearable.

347
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,960
And I'll tell you what else helps...

348
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,000
Killing as many evil sons of
bitches as I possibly can.

349
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,070
Help me!

350
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,400
Please...!

351
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,830
Help!

352
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,580
It's trying to draw us out.

353
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,250
Just stay cool. Stay put.

354
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,330
Inside the magic circle?

355
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,090
Help!

356
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,030
Help me!

357
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,280
Okay, that's no grizzly.

358
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,530
It's okay.
We'll be all right. I promise.

359
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,750
It's here.

360
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,160
I hit it!

361
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Roy, no!

362
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,790
Roy!

363
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,680
Don't move.

364
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,560
It's over here. Ugh!

365
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,120
Roy?!

366
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,850
I don't...

367
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,170
I mean, these types of things-
they aren't supposed to be real.

368
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,040
I wish I could tell you different.

369
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,170
How do we know it's not out there watching us?

370
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,800
We don't.

371
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,300
But we're safe for now.

372
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,440
How do you know about this stuff?

373
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,630
It kind of runs in the family.

374
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,070
Hey.

375
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,040
So, we've got half a chance in the daylight.

376
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,550
And I, for one...

377
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,410
want to kill this evil son of a bitch.

378
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,060
Well, hell, you know I'm in.

379
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,260
Windigo is a cree indian word.
It means, "evil that devours. "

380
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:55,800
They're hundreds of years old.

381
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:01,900
Each one was once a man, sometimes an indian
or other times a frontiers manor a miner or hunter.

382
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,080
- How's a man turn into one of those things?
- Well, it's always the same.

383
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,530
During some harsh winter,

384
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,930
a guy finds himself starving,
cut off from supplies or help

385
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:14,560
becomes a cannibal to survive,
eating other members of his tribe or camp.

386
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,480
Like the donner party.

387
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,820
Cultures all over the world believe that eating
human flesh gives a person certain abilities-

388
00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:23,710
speed, strength, immortality.

389
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,240
If you eat enough of it,

390
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,630
over years, you become this...

391
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,120
less-than-human thing.

392
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,080
You're always hungry.

393
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,870
So, if that's true, how can Tommy still be alive?

394
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,990
- You're not gonna like it.
- Tell me.

395
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,570
More than anything, a windigo knows
how to last long winters without food.

396
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,580
It hibernates for years at a time.
When it's awake,

397
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,020
it keeps its victims alive.
It stores them

398
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,590
so it can feed whenever it wants.

399
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,670
If your brother's alive, it's keeping him
somewhere dark, hidden, and safe

400
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,080
And we got to track it back there.

401
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,050
And then how do we stop it?

402
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,190
Well,

403
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,400
guns are useless- so are knives.

404
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,970
Basically...

405
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,130
we gotta torch the sucker.

406
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,760
Dean.

407
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,910
What is it?

408
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,490
You know,

409
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,850
I was thinking that those claw prints,
so clear and distinct...

410
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,720
...They were almost too easy to follow.

411
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,400
- You okay?
- His neck's broken.

412
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,790
Run, run! Go, go, go, go, go!

413
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,650
Come on. I got you. I got you.

414
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,470
Hailey!

415
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,360
Dean!

416
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:11,250
if it keeps its victims alive,
why would it kill Roy?

417
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,440
Honestly?

418
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,830
I think because Roy shot at it,
he pissed it off.

419
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,660
They went this way.

420
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,390
It's better than bread crumbs.

421
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,480
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

422
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,480
Dean.

423
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,120
You. Wake up.

424
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,340
Dean.
Hey. You okay?

425
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,860
Yeah.

426
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,330
Hailey... Hailey.

427
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,640
Wake up. Wake up.

428
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,890
Gotcha.

429
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,560
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Where is it?

430
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,430
It's gone for now.

431
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,170
Tommy.

432
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,310
Tommy.

433
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,790
Cut him down.

434
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,540
We're gonna get you home.

435
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,770
Check it out.

436
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,000
Flare guns. Those will work.

437
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,920
Looks like someone's home for supper.
We'll never out run it.

438
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,190
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah, I think so.

439
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,010
All right, listen to me. Stay with Sam.
He's gonna get you out of here.

440
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,640
What are you gonna do?

441
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,730
It's chow time, you freakin' bastard!

442
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:33,150
Yeah, that's right! Bring it on, baby!
I taste good!

443
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,930
All right, come on. Hurry!

444
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,180
Hey!

445
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,540
Hey, you want some white meat, bitch?!

446
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,000
I'm right here!

447
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,510
- Get him out of here.
- Sam, no.

448
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:12,430
Go. Go!

449
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,430
Go.

450
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,380
Come on.

451
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,640
Come on.

452
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,060
Sam!

453
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,970
Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Go!

454
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,700
Get behind me.

455
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,340
Not bad, huh?

456
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:56,260
That's when it circled the campsite. I mean,
this grizzly must have weighed 800, 900 pounds.

457
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,200
So, really, I don't know how to thank you.

458
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,730
- Must you cheapen the moment?
- Yeah!

459
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,670
- You riding with your brother?
- Yeah.

460
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,210
Let's go.

461
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,980
I hope you find your father.

462
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,630
Thanks, Sam.

463
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,870
Man, I hate camping.

464
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,350
Me too.

465
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,530
Sam, you know we're gonna find dad, right?

466
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,410
Yeah, I know.

467
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,910
But in the meantime...

468
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,300
...I'm driving.
