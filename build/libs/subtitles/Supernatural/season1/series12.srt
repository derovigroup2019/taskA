1
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,680
- What do you got those amped up to?
- A hundred thousand volts.

2
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,850
- Damn.
- Yeah, I want this rawhead extra frickin’ crispy.

3
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,020
- And remember, you only get one shot with these things.

4
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,360
- So make it count.

5
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:33,240
- On three. One. Two. Three.

6
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,540
- Is it still here? Ok. Grab your sister’s
hand, come on, we gotta get you out of here.

7
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,530
- Alright, go!

8
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,250
- Sam!

9
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,060
- Sam, get ‘em outta here!

10
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,680
- You take this!

11
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,120
- Come on.

12
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,960
- Dean!

13
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,370
- Dean, hey.

14
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,490
- Hey.

15
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,950
- Sir, I’m so sorry to ask. There doesn’t seem
to be any insurance on file.

16
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,760
- Right. Uh, ok.

17
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,900
- Okay, Mr. Burkovitz.

18
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,445
- Look, we can finish this up later.
- No, no, it’s okay.

19
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,250
- We were just taking a shortcut through the neighborhood.
And, um, the windows were rolled down, we heard some screaming.

20
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:33,970
- We drove past the house, and we stopped. Ran in.

21
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,120
- And you found the kids in the basement?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,060
- Well, thank God you did.

23
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,420
- Excuse me.
- Sure. Thanks for your help.

24
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,400
- Hey, Doc. Is he—
- He’s resting.

25
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,290
- And?
- The electrocution triggered a heart attack. Pretty massive, I’m afraid.

26
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,270
- His heart—it’s damaged.

27
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,980
- How damaged?
- We’ve done all we can.

28
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,120
- We can try and keep him comfortable at this point.
But, I’d give him a couple weeks, at most, maybe a month.

29
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,980
- No, no. There’s—there’s gotta be something
you can do, some kind of treatment.

30
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,060
- We can’t work miracles.
I really am sorry.

31
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,320
- Have you ever actually watched
daytime TV? It’s terrible.

32
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,170
- I talked to your doctor.
- That fabric softener teddy bear. Oh, I’m gonna hunt that little bitch down.

33
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,110
- Dean.
- Yeah. Alright, well, looks like you’re gonna leave town without me.

34
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,230
- What are you talking about?
I’m not gonna leave you here.

35
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,910
- Hey, you better take care of that car.
Or, I swear, I’ll haunt your ass.

36
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,550
- I don’t think that’s funny.
- Oh, come on, it’s a little funny.

37
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,330
- Look, Sammy, what can I say, man,
it’s a dangerous gig.

38
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,470
- I drew the short straw.
That’s it, end of story.

39
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,580
- Don’t talk like that, alright?
We still have options.

40
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,770
- What options?

41
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,630
- Yeah, burial or cremation.

42
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:15,570
- And I know it’s not easy. But I’m
gonna die. And you can’t stop it.

43
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,490
- Watch me.

44
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:30,120
- This is John Winchester. I can’t be reached. If this is
an emergency, call my son, Dean. 866-907-3235. He can help.

45
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,670
- Hey, Dad. It’s Sam. Uh….you probably
won’t even get this, but, uh….It’s Dean.

46
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,910
- He’s sick, and uh….the doctors say there’s nothing they can do.

47
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:49,480
- Um….but, uh, they don’t know the things we know, right?

48
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,330
- So, don’t worry, cause, uh….
I’m gonna do whatever it takes to get him better.

49
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,070
- Alright….just wanted you to know.

50
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,830
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I checked myself out.

51
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,950
- What, are you crazy?
- Well, I’m not gonna die in a hospital where the nurses aren’t even hot.

52
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,710
- You know, this whole I- laugh-in-the-face-of-death
thing? It’s crap. I can see right through it.

53
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,360
- Yeah, whatever, dude. Have you even slept?
You look worse than me.

54
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,130
- I’ve been scouring the Internet
for the last three days.

55
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,350
- Calling every contact in Dad’s journal.
- For what?

56
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,090
- For a way to help you.

57
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,480
- One of Dad’s friends, Joshua,
he called me back.

58
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,010
- Told me about a guy in Nebraska. A specialist.

59
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,740
- You’re not gonna let me die in peace, are you?
- I’m not gonna let you die, period.

60
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,710
- We’re going.

61
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,430
- I got it. Man, you are a lying bastard.
Thought you said we were going to see a doctor.

62
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,820
- I believe I said a specialist. Look, Dean,
this guy’s supposed to be the real deal.

63
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,170
- I can’t believe you brought me here to
see some guy who heals people out of a tent.

64
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,440
- Reverend LeGrange is a great man.
- Yeah, that’s nice.

65
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:44,300
- I have a right to protest. This man is a fraud. And he’s bilking all these people out of their hard
- earned money.

66
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,820
- I take it he’s not part of the flock.

67
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,800
- But when people see something they can’t explain, there’s controversy.
- Come on, Sam, a faith healer?

68
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,180
- Maybe it’s time to have
a little faith, Dean.

69
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,280
- You know what I’ve got faith in?
Reality. Knowing what’s really going on.

70
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,680
- How can you be a skeptic? With the things we see everyday?
- We see them, we know they’re real.

71
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,170
- But if you know evil’s out there, how
can you not believe good’s out there, too?

72
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,060
- Because I’ve seen what evil does to good people.
- Maybe God works in mysterious ways.

73
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,890
- Maybe he does.

74
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,620
- I think you just turned me around on the subject.

75
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,650
- Yeah, I’m sure.

76
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,040
- I’m Dean. This is Sam.
- Layla.

77
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,310
- So, if you’re not a believer,
then why are you here?

78
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,550
- Apparently my brother here
believes enough for the both of us.

79
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,020
- Come on, Layla. It’s about to start.

80
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,990
- Well, I bet you she can
work in some mysterious ways.

81
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,700
- Yeah, peace, love, and trust all over.

82
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,570
- Come on. - What are you doing? Let’s
sit here. - We’re sitting up front.

83
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,600
- What? Why? Oh, come on, Sam.
This is ridiculous. I’m good, dude, get off me.

84
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,320
- Perfect.
- Yeah, perfect.

85
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,110
- Each morning, my wife,
Sue Ann, reads me the news.

86
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,790
- Never seems good, does it?

87
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,370
- Seems like there’s always someone
committing some immoral, unspeakable act.

88
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,670
- But, I say to you, God is watching.

89
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,320
- God rewards the good,
and He punishes the corrupt.

90
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:54,160
- Who does the healing here, friends? The Lord who guides me
in choosing who to heal by helping me see into people’s hearts.

91
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,390
- Yeah, or into their wallets.

92
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,820
- You think so, young man?

93
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,910
- Sorry.
- No, no. Don’t be.

94
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,340
- Just watch what you say around
a blind man, we’ve got real sharp ears.

95
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,560
- What’s your name, son?
- Dean.

96
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,200
- Dean. I want—I want you
to come up here with me.

97
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,590
- No, that’s ok.

98
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,580
- What are you doing?
- You’ve come here to be healed, haven’t you?

99
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,980
- Well, yeah, but—

100
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,570
- No, maybe you should
just pick someone else.

101
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,310
- Oh, no, I didn’t pick you,
Dean, the Lord did.

102
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,030
- Get up there!

103
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,630
- You ready?

104
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:15,640
- Look, no disrespect, but I’m not exactly a believer.
- You will be, son. You will be.

105
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,600
- Pray with me, friends.

106
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,800
- Alright, now.

107
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,110
- Alright, now.

108
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,390
- Alright, now.

109
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,620
- Dean!

110
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,280
- Say something.

111
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,730
- So, you really feel okay?
- I feel fine, Sam.

112
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,690
- Well, according to all your tests,
there’s nothing wrong with your heart.

113
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,420
- No sign there ever was.

114
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,800
- Not that a man your age should be having heart
trouble, but, still it’s strange it does happen.

115
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,890
- What do you mean, strange?
- Just yesterday, a young guy like you, 27, athletic. Out of nowhere, heart attack.

116
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,530
- Thanks, Doc.
- Oh, no problem.

117
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,890
- That’s odd.
- Maybe it’s a coincidence. People’s hearts give out all the time, man.

118
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,800
- No, they don’t.
- Look, Dean, do we really have to look this one in the mouth?

119
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,470
- Why can’t we just be thankful that
the guy saved your life and move on?

120
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,570
- Because I can’t shake this feeling, that’s why.

121
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,360
- What feeling?

122
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,880
- When I was healed, I just—I felt wrong.

123
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:13,130
- I felt cold. And for a second, I saw someone. This, uh,
this old man. And I’m telling you, Sam, it was a spirit.

124
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,560
- But if there was something there, Dean, I think I would’ve seen
it, too. I mean, I’ve been seeing an awful lot of things lately.

125
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,100
- Well, excuse me, psychic wonder. But you’re
just gonna need a little faith on this one.

126
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,220
- Sam, I’ve been hunting long enough
to trust a feeling like this.

127
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,960
- Yeah, alright.

128
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,260
- So, what do you wanna do?
- I want you to go check out the heart attack guy. I’m gonna visit the reverend.

129
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,690
- I feel great. Just trying to, you know,
make sense of what happened.

130
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,300
- A miracle is what happened.

131
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,930
- Well, miracles come so often around Roy.

132
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,270
- When did they start? The miracles.

133
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,230
- Woke up one morning, stone blind.
Doctors figured out I had cancer.

134
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,140
- Told me I had maybe a month.
So, uh, we prayed for a miracle.

135
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,550
- Now, I was weak, but I told Sue Ann:
You just keep right on praying. ”

136
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,290
- I went into a coma. Doctors said
I wouldn’t wake up, but I did.

137
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,220
- And the cancer was gone.

138
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,950
- If it wasn’t for these eyes,
no one would believe I’d ever had it.

139
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,640
- And suddenly you could heal people.

140
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,670
- I discovered it afterward, yes.

141
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:32,630
- God’s blessed me in many ways.
- And his flock just swelled overnight.

142
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,520
- And this is just the beginning.

143
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,380
- Can I ask you one last question?
- Of course you can.

144
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,250
- Why? Why me?

145
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,060
- Out of all the sick people, why save me?

146
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,500
- Well, like I said before, the Lord guides me.

147
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,480
- I looked into your heart, and
you just stood out from all the rest.

148
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,850
- What did you see in my heart?

149
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,910
- A young man with an
important purpose. A job to do.

150
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,930
- And it isn’t finished.

151
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,490
- I’m telling you, he seemed healthy.
Swam every day, didn’t smoke.

152
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,920
- So, a heart attack just
kind of seemed, well, bizarre.

153
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,610
- And you said he was running, right before he collapsed?
- Yeah, yeah, he was freaking out.

154
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,220
- He said that something was, uh, was after him.
- Did he say what?

155
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,340
- Well, thin air is what.
I mean, it wasn’t anything.

156
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,850
- Alright, thanks.

157
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,440
- Hey, buddy? Your, uh, your clock’s busted.

158
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,590
- Oh, yeah, we, uh, can’t get it workin’.
Just froze at 4:17.

159
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,710
- Is that the same time Marshall died?
- How’d you know?

160
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,500
- Dean, hey.
- Hey.

161
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,550
- How you feeling?
- I feel good. Cured, I guess.

162
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,660
- What are you doing here?

163
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,240
- You know, my mom, she wanted
to talk to the reverend.

164
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,240
- Layla?
- Yes, I’m here again.

165
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,740
- Well, I’m sorry, but Roy is resting, and
he won’t be seeing anyone else right now.

166
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,290
- Sue Ann, please. This is our
sixth time, he’s got to see us.

167
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,010
- Roy is well aware of Layla’s situation. And he very
much wants to help just as soon as the Lord allows.

168
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,650
- Have faith, Mrs. Rourke.

169
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,340
- Why are you still even here? You got what you wanted.
- Mom. Stop.

170
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,780
- No, Layla, this is too much.

171
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,660
- We’ve been to every single service. If Roy
would stop choosing these strangers over you.

172
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,730
- Strangers who don’t even believe.
I just can’t pray any harder.

173
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,980
- Layla, what’s wrong?

174
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,120
- I have this thing….
- It’s a brain tumor.

175
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:05,090
- It’s inoperable.
In six months, the doctors say...

176
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,330
- I’m sorry.

177
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,960
- It’s okay.

178
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,140
- No. It isn’t.

179
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,000
- Why do you deserve to live
more than my daughter?

180
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,380
- What’d you find out?

181
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:00,700
- I’m sorry.

182
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,940
- Sorry about what?
- Marshall Hall died at 4:17.

183
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,810
- The exact time I was healed.
- Yeah.

184
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,030
- So, I put together a list of everyone
Roy’s healed, six people over the past year

185
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,030
- And I cross-checked them with the local obits.
Every time someone was healed, someone else died.

186
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,560
- And each time, the victim died of the same
symptom LeGrange was healing at the time.

187
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,260
- Someone’s healed of cancer, someone else dies of cancer?
- Somehow.

188
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,250
- LeGrange—he’s trading a life for another.

189
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,990
- Hello?

190
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,240
- Wait, wait, wait. So,
Marshall Hall died to save me?

191
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,450
- Dean, the guy probably
would’ve died anyway.

192
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,660
- And someone else would’ve been healed.

193
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,280
- You never should’ve brought me here.

194
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,380
- Dean, I was just trying to save your life.

195
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,430
- But, Sam, some guy
is dead now because of me.

196
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,150
- I didn’t know.

197
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,790
- Pray with me, friends.

198
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,090
- The thing I don’t understand is how is Roy
doing it? How’s he trading a life for a life?

199
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,360
- Oh, he’s not doing it.
Something else is doing it for him.

200
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,240
- What do you mean?
- The old man I saw on stage.

201
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,450
- I didn’t wanna believe it, but deep down I knew it.
- What are you talking about?

202
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,840
- There’s only one thing that
can give and take life like that.

203
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,960
- We’re dealing with a reaper.

204
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,200
- You really think it’s the Grim Reaper?
Angel of death, collect your soul, the whole deal?

205
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,540
- No, no, no. Not the Reaper, a reaper.

206
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,430
- There’s reaper lore in pretty much every
culture on Earth. Go by a hundred different names.

207
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,990
- It’s possible that there’s more than one of ‘em.
- But you said you saw a dude in a suit.

208
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,110
- Well, what, do you think he should’ve
been workin’ the whole black robe thing?

209
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,300
- You said it yourself that the clock stopped, right?

210
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:55,000
- Reapers stop time. And you can only see ‘em when they’re
comin’ at you, which is why I could see it and you couldn’t.

211
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,670
- There’s nothing else it could be, Sam.
The question is how’s Roy controllin’ the damn thing?

212
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,690
- That cross.
- What?

213
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:07,480
- There was this cross. I noticed it in the
church tent, I knew I had seen it before.

214
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,560
- Here.

215
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,620
- A tarot? It makes sense. I mean, tarot
dates back to the early Christian era, right?

216
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,300
- When some priests were still using magic?
And a few of them veered into the dark stuff.

217
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,120
- Necromancy, and how to push
death away, how to cause it.

218
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,280
- So, Roy is using black magic to bind the reaper?

219
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,910
- If he is, he’s riding the whirlwind.
It’s like putting a dog leash on a Great White.

220
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,280
- Ok, then we stop Roy.
- How?

221
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,900
- You know how.
- Wait, what the hell are you talking about, Dean? We can’t kill Roy.

222
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,970
- Sam, the guy’s playing God, he’s deciding who
lives and who dies, that’s a monster in my book.

223
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,540
- No, we’re not gonna kill a human being, Dean.

224
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,850
- We do that, we’re no better than he is.

225
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:03,270
- Okay, so we can’t kill Roy, we can’t
kill death. Any bright ideas, college boy?

226
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,130
- Okay, uh, if Roy is using some kind of black spell
on the reaper, we’ve gotta figure out what it is.

227
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,100
- And how to break it.

228
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,940
- If Roy is using a spell, there might be a spell book.
- See if you can find it.

229
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,930
- Hurry up, too, the service starts in fifteen minutes.
I’ll try to stall Roy.

230
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,950
- Roy LeGrange is a fraud. He’s no healer.

231
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,920
- Amen, brother.
- You keep up the good word.

232
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,990
- What do you got?

233
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,120
- Roy’s choosing victims he sees as immoral.
And I think I know who’s next on his list.

234
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,730
- Remember that protestor?
- The guy in the parking lot?

235
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,760
- Yeah. Yeah, I’ll find him.
But you can’t let Roy heal anyone, alright?

236
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,960
- Layla. Layla Rourke,
come up here, child.

237
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,200
- Oh, man.

238
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,250
- Layla, listen to me, you can’t go up there.

239
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,620
- Why not? We’ve waited for months.
- You can’t let Roy heal you.

240
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,090
- I don’t understand. I mean, Roy healed you,
didn’t he? Why wouldn’t I at least let him try?

241
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,080
- Because if you do, something bad is gonna happen.
I can’t explain, I just need you to believe me.

242
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,870
- Layla.
- Please.

243
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,920
- I’m sorry.
- Layla. Layla!

244
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,980
- Help!

245
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,200
- Pray with me, friends.

246
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,650
- I hope you’re ready.
- I am.

247
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,990
- Help! Help me, please!

248
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,440
- Where is it?
- It’s right there!

249
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,650
- Alright, come on!

250
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,070
- Fire!

251
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,610
- Hey, tent’s on fire!

252
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,060
- Everybody, get out of here!

253
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,080
- No! No, please!

254
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,010
- Please, don’t stop! Please!
Reverend, please! Please!

255
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:15,440
- Friends, if you’d all just leave the tent in an orderly
fashion, then we can figure out what’s going on out there.

256
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:20,480
- I did it. I stopped Roy.
- David, I think it’s okay.

257
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,680
- No!

258
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,560
- Dean, it didn’t work! The reaper’s still comin’!

259
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,830
- I’m tellin’ you! I’m tellin’ you, it must not
have worked. Roy must not be controlling this thing!

260
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,470
- Well, then who the hell is?

261
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,820
- Sue Ann.

262
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,030
- Help! Help me! Help!

263
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,200
- I got ya. I got ya.

264
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,510
- Thank God.

265
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:32,050
- I just don’t understand. After everything
we’ve done for you, after Roy healed you.

266
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,550
- We’re very, very disappointed, Dean.

267
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,670
- You can let him go, I’m not gonna press charges.
The Lord will deal with him as he sees fit.

268
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:55,480
- We catch you around here again, son, we’ll put the fear of God in you, understand?
- Yes, sir. Fear of God. Got it.

269
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,950
- Layla.

270
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,190
- Why would you do that, Dean?
When it could’ve been my only chance.

271
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,600
- He’s not a healer.
- He healed you.

272
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:15,850
- I know it doesn’t seem fair. And I wish I could
explain, but Roy is not the answer. I’m sorry.

273
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,370
- Goodbye, Dean.

274
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,710
- I wish you luck. I really do.

275
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,860
- Same to you.

276
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,520
- You deserve it a lot more than me.

277
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:47,800
- Private session tonight. No interruptions.
I give you my word. I’ll heal your daughter.

278
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,190
- Thank you, Reverend.
God bless you.

279
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,070
- So Roy really believes?

280
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,070
- I don’t think he has any
idea what his wife’s doing.

281
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,340
- Well, I found this hidden in their library.

282
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,780
- It’s ancient. Written by
a priest who went dark side.

283
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:12,180
- There’s a binding spell in
here for trapping a reaper.

284
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,060
- Must be a hell of a spell.
- Yeah. You’ve got to build a black altar.

285
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,520
- With seriously dark stuff. Bones, human blood.

286
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,990
- To cross the line like that, that
preacher’s wife. Black magic, murder.

287
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,140
- Evil.

288
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,410
- Desperate.

289
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,680
- Her husband was dying,
she’d have done anything to save him.

290
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,490
- She was using the binding spell
to keep the reaper away from Roy.

291
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,220
- Cheating death. Literally.

292
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,070
- Yeah, but Roy’s alive,
so why’s she still using the spell?

293
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,440
- Right. To force the reaper
to kill people she thinks are immoral.

294
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,450
- May God save us from half the
people who think they’re doing God’s work.

295
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,400
- We’ve gotta break
that binding spell, Dean.

296
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,890
- You know, Sue Ann had a Coptic cross like this.
And when she dropped it, the reaper backed off.

297
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,690
- So, you think we’ve gotta find the cross or destroy the altar?
- Maybe both.

298
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,310
- Whatever we do, we better do it soon.

299
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,900
- Roy’s healing Layla tonight.

300
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,830
- That’s Layla’s car. She’s already here.

301
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,120
- Yeah.

302
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,320
- Dean.
- You know, if Roy would have picked Layla instead of me, she’d be healed right now.

303
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,300
- Dean, don’t.
- And if she’s not healed tonight, she’s gonna die in a couple months.

304
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:46,890
- What’s happening to her is horrible. But, what
are you gonna do? Let somebody else die to save her?

305
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,690
- You said it yourself, Dean.
You can’t play God.

306
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,330
- Where’s Sue Ann?

307
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,370
- House.

308
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,770
- Go find Sue Ann. I’ll catch up.
- What are you—?

309
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,940
- Hey.

310
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,400
- You gonna put that fear of God in me?

311
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,860
- You see him?

312
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,480
- No.

313
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,730
- Psycho mutt.

314
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,370
- I gave your brother life,
and I can take it away.

315
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,460
- Sam, can’t you see?

316
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,800
- The Lord chose me to reward
the just and punish the wicked.

317
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:46,430
- And your brother is wicked. And he deserves
to die just as Layla deserves to live.

318
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,150
- It's God’s will.

319
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,540
- Goodbye, Sam.

320
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,150
- Mrs. Rourke, pray with me.

321
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,310
- Pray with me, friends.

322
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,840
- Alright, now.

323
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,720
- No!

324
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,170
- I don’t understand.

325
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,040
- I don’t feel different.

326
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,120
- My God! What have you done?!

327
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,740
- He’s not your God.

328
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,230
- Reverend?

329
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,210
- Sue Ann?

330
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,650
- You okay?

331
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,220
- A little bit weak.

332
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,640
- Yeah.

333
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,550
- Alright, come on,
we should get going.

334
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,760
- What is it?

335
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:52,990
- Nothing.

336
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,330
- What is it?
- We did the right thing here, didn’t we?

337
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,240
- Of course we did.

338
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,440
- Didn’t feel like it.

339
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,880
- I got it.

340
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,210
- Hey, Layla. Come on in.
- Hey.

341
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,540
- Hey.

342
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:20,940
- How’d you know we were here?
- Sam called. He said you wanted to say goodbye.

343
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,350
- I’m gonna grab a soda.

344
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,200
- So, um, where are you going?

345
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,020
- Don’t know yet. Our work
kind of takes us all over.

346
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,140
- You know, I went back to see Roy.

347
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,990
- What happened?

348
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,730
- Nothing.

349
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:56,400
- I mean, he laid his hand on
my forehead, but nothing happened.

350
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,220
- I’m sorry.

351
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,440
- I’m sorry it didn’t work.

352
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,000
- And Sue Ann. She’s dead, you know? Stroke.

353
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,430
- Yeah, I heard.

354
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,440
- I mean, Roy’s a good man.

355
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,440
- He doesn’t deserve what’s happened.

356
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,950
- It must be rough.

357
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,090
- To believe in something so much,
and have it disappoint you like that.

358
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,530
- You wanna hear something weird?

359
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,130
- Hm?

360
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,200
- I’m okay. Really.

361
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:47,770
- I guess, if you're gonna have faith, you
can’t just have it when the miracles happen.

362
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,260
- You have to have it when they don’t.

363
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,250
- So, what now?

364
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,140
- God works in mysterious ways.

365
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,050
- Goodbye, Dean.

366
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,470
- Hey.

367
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,560
- Uh, you know, I’m not
much of the prayin’ type.

368
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,840
- But I’m gonna pray for you.

369
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,460
- Well. There’s a miracle right there.
