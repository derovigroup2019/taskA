1
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,720
I know you're just doing your job

2
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,980
but the police have been here a week already.

3
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,180
I don't see why we have
to go through this again.

4
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,060
The more he tells the story
the more he believes it's true.

5
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,460
Mrs. McKay.

6
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,920
We know you spoke with the local authorities.

7
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,710
But this seems like a matter
for the State Police. So...

8
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,270
Don't worry about how crazy it sounds Evan.

9
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,310
You just tell us what you saw.

10
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,400
I was up late...

11
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,410
watching TV.

12
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,130
When I heard this...

13
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,870
Weird noise.

14
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,850
What did it sound like?

15
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,790
It sounded like a monster.

16
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,290
Tell the officers what you were watching on TV.

17
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,930
Um...

18
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,310
Godzilla versus Mothra.

19
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,290
That's my favorite Godzilla movie.

20
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,200
So much better than the original?

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,990
Totally.

22
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,290
Yeah, he likes the remake.

23
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,730
Yuck.

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,380
That's what I mean.

25
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,870
Evan?

26
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,510
Did you see what this thing was?

27
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,790
No, but I saw it grab Mr. Jenkins.

28
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,040
It pulled him underneath the car.

29
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,590
Then what?

30
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,580
It took him away.

31
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,720
I heard the monster leaving.

32
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,520
It made this really scary sound.

33
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,280
What did it sound like, Evan?

34
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,800
Like this whining growl.

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,970
Thanks for your time.

36
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,590
So the local police have novel out foul play.

37
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,970
Apparently there were signs of struggle.

38
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,520
You know, they could be right.
Could just be a kidnapping.

39
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,200
Maybe this isn't our kind of gig.

40
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,660
Yeah, maybe not.

41
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,050
Except for this.

42
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,180
Dad marked the area, Dean.

43
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,780
Possible hunting grounds of a phantom attacker.

44
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,550
Why would he even do that?

45
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,680
Well, he found a lot of local folk law
about a dog figure that comes out at night,

46
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,200
grabs people then vanishes.

47
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,770
He found this too.

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,740
This county has more missing persons per
capital than anywhere else in the state.

49
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,080
It is weird.

50
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,400
Yeah.

51
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,320
Don't phantom attackers usually
snatch people from their beds?

52
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,820
Jenkins was taken from a parking lot.

53
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,245
Well, there are all kinds, you know.

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,450
Spring Hill Jack, Spanworm Gases,
they take people anywhere, anytime.

55
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,530
Look, Dean. I don't know if
this is our kind of gig either...

56
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,500
Yeah, you're right. We should
ask around more tomorrow.

57
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,910
Right.

58
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,200
I saw a motel about five miles back.

59
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,680
Whoa, whoa, easy.

60
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,560
Let's have another round?

61
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,090
We should get an early start.

62
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,170
Now, you really know how to
have fun, don't you Grandma?

63
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,090
You're right.

64
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,040
I'll meet you outside. I'm gonna take a leak.

65
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,980
Hey, hey.

66
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,780
Have you guys been outside? Around
here like the last hour or so?

67
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,270
Sam?

68
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,190
Sammy!

69
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,300
Sam...

70
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,450
So, what can we do for you Officer Washington?

71
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,300
I'm working a missing persons.

72
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,340
I didn't know the Jenkins case was
being covered by the State Police?

73
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,660
Uh, no, no. It's someone else.

74
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,310
Actually it's my cousin.

75
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,350
We were having a few laughs at
this bar down by the highway.

76
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,170
And I haven't seen him since.

77
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,030
Did your cousin have a drinking problem?

78
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,530
Sam? Two beers and he's doing Karaoke.

79
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,580
No, he wasn't drunk. He was taken.

80
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,310
All right. What's his name?

81
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,750
Winchester.

82
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,400
Sam Winchester.

83
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,060
Like the riffle?

84
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,690
Like the riffle.

85
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,340
Winchester, Sam

86
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,950
Samuel Winchester.

87
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:49,400
So you know that his brother
Dean Winchester died in St. Louis.

88
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,290
And it was excepted a murder.

89
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,460
Yeah, Dean.

90
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,150
Kind of the black sheep of the family.

91
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,610
Handsome though.

92
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,160
Well, he's not showing up
at any current field reports.

93
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,190
I already have a lead.

94
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,970
I saw surveillance camera above the highway.

95
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,450
County traffic cam.

96
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,600
Right, yeah.

97
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,180
I'm thinking the camera
picked up whatever took him.

98
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,140
Oh, whoever.

99
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,430
Well, I have access to the traffic cam footage

100
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,160
down at the county works department, but...

101
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,850
Well... Let me tell you this the right way.

102
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,620
Won't you fill out...

103
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,070
A missing persons report.

104
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,830
And sit tight over here.

105
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,040
Officer, look uh...

106
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,230
He's family.

107
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,820
And I kind of...

108
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,700
look out for the kid.

109
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,920
You got to let me go with you.

110
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,810
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

111
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,000
Well, tell me something.

112
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,810
Your county has a fair
share of missing persons.

113
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,530
Any of them come back?

114
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,710
Sam's my responsibility. And he's coming back.

115
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,950
I'm bringing him back.

116
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,650
Greg.

117
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,450
I think we've got something.

118
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,730
These traffic cam take an
image every three seconds.

119
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,150
It's part of the amber alert program.

120
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,590
These images were all taken around
the time your cousin Sam disappeared.

121
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,690
This really isn't what I'm looking for.

122
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,390
Just wait, wait.

123
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,570
Next one.

124
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,610
This one was taken right
after Sam left the bar.

125
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,300
Look at the back in at that thing.

126
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,380
Now, look at the plates.

127
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,440
The plates look new. Probably stolen.

128
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,570
So, whoever's driving that
rust bucket must be involved.

129
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,210
Do you hear that engine?

130
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,430
Yeah.

131
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,150
Kind of a whining growl, isn't it?

132
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,400
Sure.

133
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,570
I'll be damned.

134
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,730
You're alive?

135
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,780
Hey, you okay?

136
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,650
Does it look like I'm doing okay?

137
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,800
Where are we?

138
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,310
I don't know.

139
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,120
Country, I think.

140
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,260
Smells like the country.

141
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,360
You're Jenkins, aren't you?

142
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,770
Yeah.

143
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,940
Wow, I was looking for you.

144
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,010
Oh, yeah?

145
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,780
Yeah.

146
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,270
Well, no offense. But
this is a piss poor rescue.

147
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,710
Well, my brother's out there right
now too. He's looking for us. So...

148
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,780
So, he's not gonna find us.

149
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,770
We're in the middle of nowhere.

150
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,610
Waiting for them to come back
and do God knows what to us.

151
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,290
What are they?

152
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,680
Have you seen them?

153
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,535
What are you talking about?

154
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,380
Whatever grabbed us, what did they look like?

155
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,060
See for yourself.

156
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,560
Leave me alone.

157
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,120
Don't touch me. Leave me alone!

158
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,880
I'll be damned.

159
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,120
They're just people.

160
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,290
Yeah, what did you expect?

161
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,270
How often do they feed you?

162
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,350
Once a day.

163
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,030
They use that thing over
there to open the cage.

164
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,470
And that's the only time you see them?

165
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,790
So far. But I'm waiting.

166
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,650
Waiting for what?

167
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,450
Their baiting time, man.

168
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,620
I think that's the least
of your worries right now.

169
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,360
Oh, yeah?

170
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:45,780
Yeah.

171
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,020
What do you they want then?

172
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,470
Depends on who they are.

173
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,390
They're bunch of psycho
hill-billy red neck if you ask me.

174
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,040
Looking for love in all the wrong places.

175
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay, the next traffic cam

176
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,480
is fifty miles from here and your
pickup didn't pass that one. So...

177
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,380
So, it must have pulled up somewhere.

178
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,210
I don't see any other roads here.

179
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,580
Well, a lot of these back woods
properties have their own private roads.

180
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,350
Great.

181
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,020
So, Gregory.

182
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:38,990
Yeah.

183
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,950
I ran your badge number.

184
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,580
It's routine when working
A case with State Police

185
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,390
for county purposes when we have you.

186
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,080
And they just got back to me...

187
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,660
Says here your badge was stolen.

188
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,490
And there's a picture of you.

189
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,300
I lost some weight.

190
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,590
And I got that Michael Jackson skin disease...

191
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,340
Okay.

192
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,800
Would you step out of the car please?

193
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,670
Look, look, look.

194
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,720
If you want to arrest me that's fine.

195
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,850
I'll cooperate. I swear.

196
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,940
But first please...

197
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,920
Let me find Sam.

198
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,420
I don't even know who you are.

199
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,830
Or if this Sam person is missing.

200
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,110
Look into my eyes and tell
me if I'm lying about this.

201
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,470
Identity theft. You're
impersonating an officer.

202
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,080
Here's the thing. When...

203
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,140
When we were young...

204
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,060
I pretty much pulled him from a fire.

205
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,070
And ever since then I felt responsible for him.

206
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,910
You know, like it's my job to keep him safe.

207
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,010
I'm just afraid if we don't find him fast.

208
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,810
Please...

209
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,100
He's my family.

210
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,910
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,320
You've given me no choice.

212
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,680
I have to take you in.

213
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,680
After we find Sam Winchester.

214
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,760
What's your name again?

215
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,745
It's Sam.

216
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,040
Why won't you give it up
Sammy. There's no way out.

217
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,600
Don't...

218
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,650
Call me...

219
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,130
Sammy.

220
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,790
What is it?

221
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,920
It's a bracket.

222
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,570
Well, thank God a bracket.
Now we got them, huh?

223
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,270
Must have been a short.

224
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,090
Maybe you knocked something loose.

225
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,500
I think you should get back in there Jenkins.

226
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,070
What?

227
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,150
This isn't right.

228
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,090
Do you want to get out of here?

229
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,960
Yeah, but that was too easy.

230
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,120
Look, I'm gonna get out of
here. I'm gonna send help. Okay?

231
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,950
Okay. Don't worry.

232
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,620
No.

233
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,330
I'm serious, Jenkins. This might be a trap.

234
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,210
Bye, Sammy.

235
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,340
Jenkins!

236
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,500
Thank you.

237
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,690
Okay, officer.

238
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,450
Look I'm gonna press my luck.

239
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,330
Your luck is so pressed.

240
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,190
Right.

241
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,270
I was wondering...

242
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,820
Why are you helping me out anyway?

243
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,130
Why don't you just lock me up?

244
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,210
My brother Riley disappeared three years ago.

245
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,510
A lot like Sam.

246
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,350
We searched for him but...

247
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,520
Nothing.

248
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,970
I know what it's like to
feel responsible for someone.

249
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,220
And for them...

250
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,170
Come on, let's keep at it.

251
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,740
Wait, wait. Pull over here. Pull over.

252
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,130
It's the first turn off I've seen so far.

253
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,850
You stay here, I'll check it out.

254
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,940
No way.

255
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,000
Hey...

256
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,400
You're a civilian.

257
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,120
And a felon, I think.

258
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,470
I'm not taking you with me.

259
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,270
You're not going without me.

260
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,460
All right. You promise...

261
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,620
You won't get involved. You let me handle it.

262
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,530
Yeah, I promise.

263
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,400
Shake on it.

264
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,970
Oh, come on.

265
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,900
This is ridiculous.

266
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,580
Katherine, I really think
you're gonna need my help.

267
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,830
I'll manage. Thank you.

268
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,960
I got to start carrying paper clips.

269
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,750
Hello?

270
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,630
Anybody home?

271
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,220
Hi.

272
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,210
How are you?

273
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,390
Who are you?

274
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,550
I'm Katherine. I'm a deputy.

275
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,510
What's your name?

276
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,080
Missy.

277
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,490
Missy? That's a pretty name.

278
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,850
Missy, is your mom home?

279
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,190
She's dead.

280
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,900
I'm sorry, what about your dad?

281
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,390
No?

282
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,890
Can I come in for a minute?

283
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,540
I just want you look at a picture.

284
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,880
Have you seen that guy?

285
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,180
Look at that picture.

286
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,560
What?

287
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,010
That's gonna hurt.

288
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,300
Missy, sweetheart.

289
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,750
Go tell your brothers, I want to see them.

290
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,230
Yes, daddy.

291
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,600
Son of a bitch.

292
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,920
But I've never seen him so angry before.

293
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,100
Never been followed by the police before.

294
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,850
You all right?

295
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,630
Are you Sam Winchester? Aren't you?

296
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,350
Yeah.

297
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,040
You're...

298
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,610
You're cousin's looking for you.

299
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,440
Thank God.

300
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,420
Where is he?

301
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,380
He uh...

302
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,790
I cuffed him to my car.

303
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,250
Sam?

304
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,130
Are you hurt?

305
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,810
No.

306
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,420
Damn, it's good to see you.

307
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,110
How did you get out of the cuffs?

308
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,880
I know a trick or two.

309
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,730
All right.

310
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,370
Oh.

311
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,900
These locks they're gonna be a bitch.

312
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,020
Well, there's some kind of
automatic control. Right there.

313
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,010
Have you seen them?

314
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,260
Yeah.

315
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,420
Dude, they're just people.

316
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,440
And they jumped you?

317
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,840
Must be getting a little rusty there, kiddo.

318
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,820
What do they want?

319
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,525
I don't know.

320
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,350
They let Jenkins go, but...

321
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,090
That was some sort of trap.

322
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,120
It doesn't make any sense to me.

323
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,460
Oh, well that's the point.

324
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,630
You know with...

325
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,510
Our usual play mates there's rules,
here's patterns. But with people...

326
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,280
They're just crazy.

327
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,760
You see anything else out there?

328
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,980
He has about a dozen junk cars
out back. Plates from all over.

329
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,450
So, I'm thinking when they take
someone they take their car too.

330
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:26,580
Did you see a black mustang?
Out there about ten years old?

331
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,000
Yeah, actually I did.

332
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,500
Your brothers?

333
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,030
I'm sorry.

334
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,240
Let's get you guys out of here. Then
we'll take care of those bastards.

335
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,330
It takes a key, key?

336
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,620
I don't know.

337
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,460
All right, I better go find it.

338
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,070
Hey.

339
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,280
Be careful.

340
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,390
Yeah.

341
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,940
Well, I'll say it again.

342
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,470
Demons I get.

343
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,960
People are crazy.

344
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,560
What the...

345
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,590
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

346
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,560
I know.

347
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,000
Daddy!

348
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,410
Daddy!

349
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,130
Daddy!

350
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,500
Daddy!

351
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,850
I'm gonna kick your ass first.

352
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,020
Then yours.

353
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,200
Come on.

354
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,690
Let's hunt.

355
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,620
Yeah, this one's a fighter.

356
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,500
Sure be fun to hunt.

357
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,960
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

358
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,000
This is what this is about? You...

359
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,730
You yahoos hunt people?

360
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,520
You ever killed before?

361
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,440
What?

362
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,220
Well, it depends on what you mean.

363
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,450
I've hunted all my life.

364
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,060
Just like my father, his before him.

365
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,100
I've hunted deer...

366
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,840
and bear...

367
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,780
I even got a coo-coo once. Oh boy.

368
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,870
But the best hunt...

369
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,280
is human.

370
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,100
Oh, there's nothing like it.

371
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,450
Holding their life in your hands.

372
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,210
Seeing the fear in their
eyes just before they go dark.

373
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,980
Makes you feel powerful alive.

374
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,840
You're a sick puppy.

375
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,350
We give them a weapon.

376
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,150
Give him a fighting chance.

377
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,600
It's kind of like...

378
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,540
Our tradition passed down

379
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,610
father to son, cost only one or two a year.

380
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,500
Never enough to bring the lot
down we've never been that sloppy.

381
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,960
Yeah, well. Don't save yourself short.

382
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,570
You're plenty of sloppy.

383
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,670
So what? You're with that pretty cop?

384
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,680
Are you a cop?

385
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,700
If I tell you...

386
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,470
You promise not to make me into an ash tray?

387
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,030
Only reason I don't let my
boys take you right here now

388
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,420
is that there's something I need to know.

389
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,140
Yeah, how about it's not
nice to marry your sister.

390
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:38,460
Tell me, any of the cops
go come looking for you?

391
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,750
Oh, eat me.

392
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,960
No, no, no. Wait. You actually might.

393
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,150
You think this is funny?

394
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,970
You've brought this down on my family.

395
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,550
All right?

396
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,490
You want to play games?

397
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,410
We'll play some games.

398
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,150
Looks like we're gonna have a
hunt tonight after all, boys.

399
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,130
And you get to pick the animal.

400
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,410
The boy or the cop.

401
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,680
Okay, wait, wait.

402
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,010
Look, nobody's coming for
me. All right? It's just us.

403
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,140
You don't choose, I will.

404
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,940
Oh, you son of a bitch!

405
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,010
Next time, I'll take an eye.

406
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,700
All right, all right. The
guy. The guy. Take the guy!

407
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,010
Lee.

408
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,700
Go do it.

409
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,730
Don't let him out though.

410
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,240
Shoot him in the cage.

411
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,310
What?

412
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,220
I thought you said you were gonna hunt him.

413
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,440
You're gonna give him a chance!

414
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,950
Lee!

415
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,770
When you're done with the boy.

416
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,620
Shoot the bitch too.

417
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,140
We're cleaning this mess up before
any more cops come running out here.

418
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,430
What are you doing?

419
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,400
Hey!

420
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,740
You hurt my brother, I'll kill you. I swear.

421
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,070
I'll kill you all.

422
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,360
I will kill you all!

423
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,830
Lee!

424
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,240
Damn.

425
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,870
Lee!

426
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,700
Jack, you come with me.

427
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,120
Missy.

428
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,650
You watch him now.

429
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,370
Lee?

430
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,340
Where are you?

431
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,660
Lee?

432
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,170
Damn it. Jack, hit the lights.

433
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,790
They must have pulled the fuses.

434
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,890
You stupid...

435
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,060
Hey!

436
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,690
I'll watch this one. You go ahead.

437
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,710
Go ahead.

438
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,170
You hurt my family.

439
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,640
I'm gonna bleed you bitch.

440
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,080
You killed my brother.

441
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,380
Your brother?

442
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,370
Now I see.

443
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,890
Just tell me why.

444
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:15,000
Because it's fun.

445
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,880
Where's the girl?

446
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,240
I locked her in the closet.

447
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,330
What about the dad?

448
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,410
Shot. Trying to escape.

449
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,830
I think the car's at the police station.

450
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,160
Backup units on route to your location.

451
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,440
So...

452
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,950
State Police and the FBI are
gonna be here within the hour.

453
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,760
They're gonna want to talk to you.

454
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:18,410
I suggest that you're both long gone by then.

455
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,340
Thanks.

456
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,190
Hey, listen. I don't mean to press our luck.

457
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,900
But we're kind of in the middle of nowhere.

458
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,200
You think we could catch a ride?

459
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,420
Start walking.

460
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,800
Duck if you see a SWAT car.

461
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,140
Sounds great to me. Thanks.

462
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,670
Listen...

463
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,480
I'm sorry about your brother.

464
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,840
Thank you.

465
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,600
It was really hard not
knowing what happened to him.

466
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:53,910
I thought it would be easier
once I knew the truth. But...

467
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,300
It isn't really.

468
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,470
Anyway you should go.

469
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,580
Don't ever do that again.

470
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,700
Do what?

471
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,610
Go missing like that.

472
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,170
You were worried about me.

473
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,410
I'm saying, you vanish like that
again I'm not looking for you.

474
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,670
Sure you will.

475
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,400
I'm not.

476
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,370
So you got saddled on by
a 13 year old girl, huh?

477
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,350
Oh, shut up!

478
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,250
Just saying getting rusty there, kiddo.

479
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,370
Shut up!
