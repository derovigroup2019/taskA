So tell us what happened.

76
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:27,617
Well.... Zach, he came home,
and he found Emily tied to a chair.

77
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:32,914
And she was beaten up and bloody,
and she wasn't breathing, and so he--

78
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:37,085
He called 91 1 and the police,
they showed up and--

79
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,337
And they arrested him.

80
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,758
But the thing is, the only way
that Zach could have killed Emily...

81
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,260
...is if he was in two places
at the same time.

82
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,849
The police, they have a video. lt's from
the security tape from across the street.

83
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:55,520
And it shows Zach
coming home at 1 0:30.

84
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,939
Now, Emily was killed just after that.

85
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:02,986

a few beers until at least after midnight.

see the crime scene.

-We could.

00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,078
