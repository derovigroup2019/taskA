1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,010
Dad's missing. I need you help me find him.

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,960
I can't do this alone.

3
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,540
Dad's given us a job to do.

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,430
He wants us to pick up what he left off.

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,270
Saving people, hunting things.

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,270
This demon killed mom and Jess.

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,300
I've got to find dad.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,770
I've got to find Jessica's killer.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,190
- I'm Meg.
- So, where are you headed?

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,060
No way I'm telling you.
You could be some kind of freak.

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,200
Dad?

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,270
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,480
In 1835, Samuel Colt
made a special gun.

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,520
They say this gun can kill anything.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,370
Though my eyes could see
I still was a blind man

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,150
Though my mind could think
I still was a mad man

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,630
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,240
I have these nightmares
and sometimes, they come true.

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,700
Carry on my wayward son

20
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,160
You two are all I've got.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,860
But I guess we are stronger
as a family.

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,760
We go after this damn thing,
together.

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,550
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

24
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,080
Don't you cry no more...

25
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,490
Good morning.

26
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,610
Can I help you?

27
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,530
I kinda...

28
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,500
I need to talk.

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,160
Well, that's what I'm here for.

30
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,940
I've done some things...

31
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,280
Not good things.

32
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,710
Well, there's always forgiveness
for us if we seek it.

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,310
For everyone?

34
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,620
Are you sure?

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,420
I like to say salvation was created
for sinners.

36
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,450
Tell me what's on your mind.

37
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,980
Well, I've lied...

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,700
A lot.

39
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,550
I've stolen.

40
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,700
I've lusted.

41
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,300
And the other day, I've met this man.

42
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,220
A nice guy, you know?

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,210
We had a really good chat...

44
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,490
Sort of like this.

45
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,790
Then I slit his throat and
ripped his heart out through his chest.

46
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,220
Does that make me a bad person?

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,470
I know what you are.

48
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,310
You can't be here.

49
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,660
This is hallowed ground!

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,750
Please.

51
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,410
Maybe that works in the minor leagues.

52
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,020
But not with me.

53
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,240
You throw like a girl.

54
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,850
What do you want?

55
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,000
The Winchesters.

56
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,520
I haven't spoken to John Winchester
in over a year.

57
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,750
You're wasting your time.

58
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,040
Even if I did know where they were,

59
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,530
I'd never tell you.

60
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,670
I know.

61
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,330
So this is it.
This is everything I know.

62
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,730
We got our all lives been searching for
this demon, right?

63
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,940
Not a trace. Just...

64
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,060
nothing.

65
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,070
Until about a year ago.

66
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,140
For the first time, I picked up a trail.

67
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,160
- That's when you took off.
- Yeah.

68
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,890
That's right. The demon must have
come out of hiding or hibernation.

69
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,750
So, what's this trail you found?

70
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,290
It starts in Arizona, then
New Jersey, California.

71
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,350
Houses burnt down at the ground.

72
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,660
It's going after families.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,740
Just like it went after us.

74
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,990
Families with infants?

75
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,960
Yeah,

76
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,410
the night of kids' 6 month birthday.

77
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,980
I was 6 months old that night?

78
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,490
Exactly 6 months.

79
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,140
So basically this demon is going after
these kids for some reason.

80
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,470
The same why he came for me.

81
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,860
So mom's death...

82
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,620
Jessica...
It's all 'cause of me?

83
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,880
- We don't know that, Sam.
- Oh really?

84
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,200
'Cause I'd say we're pretty damn sure, Dean.

85
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,470
For the last time, what happened to them
is not your fault.

86
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,840
Yeah, you're right, it's not my fault.
But it's my problem.

87
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,470
No, it's not your problem.
It's our problem.

88
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,530
Ok,

89
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,510
that's enough.

90
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,670
So why is it doing?

91
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,040
What does it want?

92
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,560
I'd wish I had more answers.
I do.

93
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,690
I've always been one step behind it.

94
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,630
Look, I've never got there
in time to save...

95
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,170
So how do we find it before it hits again?

96
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,400
There are signs.

97
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,570
Look, it took me a while
to see the pattern.

98
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,830
But in the days before these fires,
signs crop up in the area.

99
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,000
Cattle death, temperature fluctuations,

100
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,390
electrical storms.

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,510
And then I went back and checked and...

102
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,970
The same thing happened in Lawrence.

103
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,130
A week before your mother died.

104
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,080
And in Palo Alto.

105
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,740
Before Jessica.

106
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,360
And these signs...
they're starting again.

107
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,060
Where?

108
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,720
Salvation, Iowa.

109
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,500
- Damnit!
- What is it?

110
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,440
- Son of a bitch!
- What is it?

111
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,940
I just got a call from Caleb.

112
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,840
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

113
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,690
Jim Murphy is dead.

114
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,200
Pastor Jim?

115
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,160
How?

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,710
His throat was slit.

117
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,490
He bled out.

118
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,200
Caleb says they found traces of sulphur
in Jim's place.

119
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,490
A demon.

120
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,760
The demon?

121
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,310
I don't know.

122
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,870
It could be...
Caleb...

123
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,820
Maybe the demon knows
we're getting close.

124
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,920
What do you wanna do?

125
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,250
Now we act like every second counts.

126
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,160
There's two hospitals and
a house nursery in this county.

127
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,420
We split up.
We cover more ground.

128
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,590
I want records.

129
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,770
I want a list of every infant

130
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,900
that's gonna be 6 months old
the next week.

131
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,390
Dad, that can be dozens of kids.

132
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,520
How the hell are we gonna know
which one is the right one?

133
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,010
We'lle check them all.
That's how.

134
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,120
Or you got better ideas?

135
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,840
No, Sir.

136
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,880
Dad?

137
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,520
Yeah...

138
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,000
It's Jim.

139
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,500
I can't...

140
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,800
This ends. Now...

141
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,520
I'm ending it.

142
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,700
I don't care what it takes.

143
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,130
- Here we go, officer.
- Thank you.

144
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,330
Hi. Is there anything I could do for you?

145
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,770
Oh god, yes!

146
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,310
Only I, uh...

147
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,120
I'm working right now, so...

148
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,830
A train.

149
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,980
Hi, here, let me hold that.

150
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,550
I think you don't need that anymore.

151
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,570
Thanks.

152
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,120
She's gorgeous. Is she yours?

153
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,350
- Yeah.
- Oh wow, hi.

154
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,080
I'm sorry, I'm rude.
I'm Sam.

155
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,530
I just move end up the block.

156
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,800
Oh, hey, I'm Monica.

157
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,885
- This is Rosie.
- Rosie? Hey Rosie.

158
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,280
- So... Welcome to the neighbourhood.
- Thank you.

159
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,630
- She's such a good baby.
- I know. She... I mean, she never cries.

160
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,520
She just stares at everybody.

161
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,170
Sometimes she looks, and I swear it's...
It's like she's reading your mind.

162
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,000
What about you, Monica, you live here alone?

163
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,210
Oh my husband and I, we bought our place
just before Rosie was born.

164
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,380
- How old is Rosie?
- She's 6 months today.

165
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,980
She's big, right?
Growing like a weed!

166
00:12:51,015 --> 00:12:52,370
Yeah...

167
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,290
Monica...

168
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,510
Yeah?

169
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,850
- Just... Just take care of yourself, okay?
- Yeah, you too, Sam.

170
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,550
- We'll see around.
- Yeah, definitely.

171
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,450
Here is daddy!

172
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,480
What do you...

173
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,750
Rosie!

174
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,070
A vision?

175
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,090
Yes.

176
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,910
I saw the demon burning a woman
on the ceiling.

177
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,360
And you think it's gonna happen to
this woman you met because...

178
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,920
Because these things happen exactly
the way I see them.

179
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,510
He started having these nightmares.

180
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,790
And he started having them
when he was awake.

181
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,970
That's like... I don't know.
It's like closer I get

182
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,220
to anything involving the demon,
the stronger the visions get.

183
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,710
Right. When would you wanna
tell me about this?

184
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,840
Tonight.

185
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,500
Something like this such happens
to your brother,

186
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,830
you pick up the phone and you call me.

187
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,400
Call you?

188
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,970
Are you kidding me?

189
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,850
Dad, I called you from Lawrence.

190
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,960
Alright, Sam called you
when I was dying.

191
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,600
I mean, getting you on the phone,

192
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,210
I got a better chance of
winning the lottery.

193
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,250
You're right.

194
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,060
Although I'm not real crazy about
this new tone of yours, you're right.

195
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,320
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,590
Look guys, vision or no vision,
the fact is

197
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,680
we know the demon is coming tonight.

198
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,690
And this family is gonna go through
the same hell that we went through.

199
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,200
No, they're not.

200
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,280
No one is. Ever again.

201
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,910
Hello?

202
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,910
Sam...

203
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,730
Who is this?

204
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,420
Think real hard. It will come to you.

205
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,920
Meg.

206
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,930
The last time I saw you,
you have fell out of a window.

207
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,530
Yeah, thanks to you.

208
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,950
That really hurt my feelings by the way.

209
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,330
Just your feelings?

210
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,460
That was a 7 story drop.

211
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,010
Let me speak to your dad.

212
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,110
My dad?

213
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,040
I don't know where my dad is.

214
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,090
It's time for the growing ups
to talk, Sam.

215
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:43,700
Let me speak to him now.

216
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,080
- This is John.
- Hi dear John, I'm Meg.

217
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,020
I'm a friend of your boys.

218
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,800
I'm also the one who watched Jim Murphy,

219
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,340
chokep up in his own blood.

220
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,990
Still there John Boy?

221
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,550
I'm here.

222
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:13,000
But that was yesterday.
Today I'm in Lincoln...

223
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,180
Visiting an other old friend of yours.

224
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,480
He wants to say hi.

225
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,550
John, whatever they do,
don't give...

226
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,900
Caleb?

227
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,490
Caleb?

228
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,770
You listen to me,

229
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,040
he's got nothing to do with anything.
You let him go.

230
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,450
We know you have the colt, John.

231
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

232
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,260
Oh, okay.

233
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,940
So listen to this.

234
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,110
Caleb?

235
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,780
Caleb?!

236
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,970
Can you hear that?

237
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,090
That's the sound of your friend dying.

238
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,700
Now let's try this again.

239
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,410
We know you have the gun, John.
Words travel fast.

240
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,070
So as far as we're concerned,
you just declared war.

241
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,140
And this is what war looks like.

242
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,860
It has casualties.

243
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,790
I'm gonna kill you, you know that?

244
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,950
Oh, John, please.
Mind your blood pressure.

245
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,460
So this is the thing.

246
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,140
We're gonna keep doing what we're doing.

247
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,670
And your friends...

248
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,220
Anyone who's ever helped you
or gave you shelter...

249
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,510
Anyone you ever loved.

250
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:28,160
They'll all die.

251
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,060
Unless you give us that gun.

252
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,180
I'm waiting, Johnny.

253
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,340
Better answer before the buzzer.

254
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,230
Okay.

255
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,770
Sorry?

256
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,670
I didn't clearly get that.

257
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,350
I said okay.

258
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,130
I'll bring you the colt.

259
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,260
There's a warehouse in Lincoln.

260
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,090
In the corner of Walbash and Lake.
You're gonna meet me there.

261
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,910
It's gonna take me about
a day as drive to get there.

262
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,880
Meet me there at midnight, tonight.

263
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,960
That's impossible.
I can't get there in time.

264
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,740
And I can't just carry a gun on a plane.

265
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,710
The I guess your friends die, don't they?

266
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,090
If you do decide to make it,

267
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,850
come alone.

268
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,790
What the hell are you looking at?

269
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,970
So you think Meg is a demon?

270
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,700
Either that or she's possessed by one.

271
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,240
It doesn't really matter.

272
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,220
- What do we do?
- I'm going to Lincoln.

273
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,820
- What?
- It doesn't seem like I have a choice.

274
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,990
If I don't go,

275
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,610
a lot of people'll die.
Our friends'll die.

276
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,385
Dad, the demon is coming tonight.

277
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,010
For Monica and her family,
that gun is all we've got.

278
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,250
You can't just hand it over!

279
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,760
Who said anybody would hand it over?

280
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,220
Look, besides us and a couple of vampires,
no one's really seen the gun.

281
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,480
No one knows what it looks like.

282
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,030
So what? You're just gonna pick up
ringer at a pawn shop?

283
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,510
Antique store.

284
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,290
You're gonna hand Meg a fake gun
and hope she doesn't notice?

285
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,680
Look, as long as it's close...

286
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,880
she shouldn't be able
to tell the difference.

287
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,965
Yeah, but for how long?

288
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,500
What happens when she figures this out?

289
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,010
I just... I just need to buy
a few hours. That's all.

290
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,360
You mean for Dean and me.

291
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,260
You want us to stay here.

292
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,550
And kill this demon by ourselves.

293
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,940
No, Sam.

294
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,260
I wanna stop losing people we love.

295
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,890
I want you to go to school.
I want Dean to have a home.

296
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,390
I want Mary alive.

297
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,160
I just...

298
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,560
I just want this to be over.

299
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,810
Did you get it?

300
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,830
You know this is a trap, don't you?

301
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,870
That's why Meg wants you to come alone.

302
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,300
I can handle her.

303
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,310
I got a whole arsenal loaded.
Holy water, amulets...

304
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,340
- Dad.
- What?

305
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,170
- Promise me something.
- What's that?

306
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,850
If things go suck, just...
get the hell out.

307
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,780
Don't get yourself killed, alright?
You're no good to us dead.

308
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,530
The same goes for you.

309
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,880
Alright, listen to me.

310
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,770
They made the bullet special for this colt.

311
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,650
Only 4 of them are left.

312
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,050
Without them, this gun is useless.

313
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,870
Make every shot count.

314
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,300
Yes, Sir.

315
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,500
I've been waiting a long time
for this fight.

316
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,240
Now it's to you.
I'm not gonna be in it.

317
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,940
It's up to you boys now.

318
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,260
It's your fight.
You finish this.

319
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
You finish what I started.

320
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,190
You understand?

321
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,460
We'll see you soon, dad.

322
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,840
I'll see you later.

323
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,380
Later.

324
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,070
Maybe we could tell them there's a gas leak.

325
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,390
That might get them out of the house
for a few hours.

326
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,450
Yeah, and how many times has that
actually worked for us?

327
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,030
Yeah...

328
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,300
We could always tell them the truth.

329
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,190
Naah...

330
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,010
I know. I know, it's just...

331
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,530
What's coming after for these people?

332
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,680
Sam, we'll only got one move
and you know it, right?

333
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,600
We're gonna wait for this demon
to show itself...

334
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,170
And we get it before it gets them.

335
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,970
I wonder how Dad’s doing.

336
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,490
I’d feel a lot better
if we were there backing him up.

337
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,540
I’d feel a lot better
if he were here backing us up.

338
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,770
Au nom de J?sus, b?nis cette eau.

339
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,940
"In nomine de patris, in de patentis,"

340
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,700
"en de virtute, espiriti santi".

341
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,210
That's weird.

342
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,590
What?

343
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,170
After all these years, we're finally here.

344
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,620
That doesn't seem real.

345
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,750
We're just gonna keep our heads,
do our job, like always.

346
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,120
Yeah, but this isn't like always.

347
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,140
True.

348
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,620
Dean, uh...

349
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,030
I want to thank you.

350
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,880
For what?

351
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,770
For everything.

352
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,670
You've always had my back, you know.

353
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,830
Even when I couldn't count on anyone,
I could always count on you.

354
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,360
And uh...

355
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,380
I just wanted to let you know.

356
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,260
Just in case...

357
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you kidding me?

358
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,940
What?

359
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,900
Don't say
"just in case something happens to you".

360
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,650
I don't want to hear that freaking speech,
man.

361
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,390
Nobody's dying tonight.

362
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,150
Not us, not that family.
Nobody.

363
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,030
Except that demon.

364
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,800
That evil son of a bitch ain't getting
any older than tonight, understand me?

365
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,700
John, you made it.

366
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,430
Too bad really,

367
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,900
I was hoping to kill more of your friends.

368
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,880
Sorry to desappoint.

369
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,780
I can see where your boys
got their good looks.

370
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,010
Though I must admit, considering what
they say about you...

371
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,030
I thought you'd be...

372
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,760
taller.

373
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,990
Well, aren't you the chatty one?

374
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,640
You wanna get to business?

375
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,070
Fine.

376
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,240
Why don't you hand over the gun?

377
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,370
If I give you the gun,
how do I get out of here?

378
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,630
If you're good as they say you are,
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

379
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,740
Maybe I'll just shoot you.

380
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,520
You wanna shoot me, baby?

381
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,910
Go ahead.
It won't end anything.

382
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,250
There are more where I came from.

383
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,790
Who the hell is that?

384
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,220
He's not nearly as much fun as I am.
I can tell you that.

385
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,540
So I suggest you give us the gun.

386
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,350
Now!

387
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,530
This is the colt?

388
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,940
What do you think?

389
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,350
You shot me!

390
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,570
I can't believe you just shot me!

391
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,250
It's a fake!

392
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,100
You're dead, John.

393
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,750
Your boys are dead.

394
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,950
I never used the gun.

395
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,030
How could I know it wouldn't work?

396
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,310
I am so not in the mood for this,
I've just been shot!

397
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,160
Well then, I guess you're lucky
the gun wasn't real.

398
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,920
That's funny, John.

399
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,070
We're gonna strip the skin from your bones,
but that was funny.

400
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,410
Holy water, John?

401
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,700
Real cute.

402
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,880
Dad's not answering.

403
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,460
Maybe Meg was late.

404
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,360
- Maybe cell reception's bad.
- Yeah, well...

405
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,270
Dean, wait.

406
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,890
Listen.

407
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,290
It's coming.

408
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,790
Damnit!

409
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,730
Get out of my house!

410
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,650
Get out of my house!

411
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,090
- Mr. Holt, please.
- Be quiet and listen to me.

412
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,730
Be quiet and listen to me.

413
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,680
We're trying to help you.

414
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,050
- Charlie?
- Okay?

415
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,830
Is everything okay down there?

416
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,590
- Monica, get the baby!
- Don't go to the nursery!

417
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,150
You stay away from her...

418
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,040
What do you...

419
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,350
Where the hell did he go?

420
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,490
- My baby!
- No, wait.

421
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,680
I got her. I got her.

422
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,840
- My baby!
- He's got her.

423
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,260
You get away from my family!

424
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,080
Charlie, don't, they saved us.

425
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,880
I mean, they saved us.

426
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,740
Thank you.

427
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,970
It's still in there.

428
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,210
- Sam, Sam! No.
- Dean, let me go!

429
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,170
- It's still in there!
- It’s burning to the ground! It’s suicide!

430
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,850
- I don't care!
- I do!

431
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,590
Come on, dad. Answer your phone, damnit!

432
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,260
Something's wrong.

433
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,910
You hear me? Something happened.

434
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,750
If you had just let me go in there...

435
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,710
I could have ended all this...

436
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,600
Sam,

437
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,990
the only thing you would end was your life.

438
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,110
You don't know that.

439
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,910
So what? You're just willing
to sacrify yourself? Is that it?

440
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,670
Yeah. Yeah you're damn right.
I am.

441
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,510
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Not as long as I'm around.

442
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,040
What the hell are you talking about, Dean?

443
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,410
We've been searching for this demon
our whole life.

444
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,430
It's the only thing we've ever cared about.

445
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,050
Sam, I wanna waste it.
I do. Okay?

446
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,760
But it's not worth dying over.

447
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,160
- What?
- I mean it.

448
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,620
If hunting this demon means you
getting yourself killed...

449
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,170
Then I hope we never find the damn thing.

450
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,300
That thing killed Jess.

451
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,880
That thing killed mom.

452
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,120
You said yourself once...

453
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,920
that no matter what we do, they're gone.

454
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,690
And they're never coming back.

455
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,600
Don't you say that, not you...

456
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,410
Not after all this, don't you say that!

457
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,390
Sam, look...

458
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,760
The three of us,

459
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,820
that's all we have.

460
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,270
And it's all I have.

461
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,250
Sometimes I feel like I'm barely holding it
together, man.

462
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,280
And without you or Dad...

463
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,070
Dad...

464
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,620
He should have called by now.

465
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,510
Try again.

466
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,450
You boys really screwed up this time.

467
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,890
Where is he?

468
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,170
You're never gonna see your father again.
