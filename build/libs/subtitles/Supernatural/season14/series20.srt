1
00:00:01,761 --> 00:00:03,300
Then it's all true.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,570
God, the Devil.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,600
Now you live in a secret bunker

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,970
with an angel and Lucifer's kid.

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,770
Dad, none of this would have
happened without you.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,440
<i>Aah!</i>

7
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,560
This isn't just Michael
we're talking about.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,760
It's Dean.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,400
I can feel him in my head.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Michael gets out,
that's it for this world.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,700
Billie said that there's only
one way that this ends right.

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,440
- A Ma'lak box.
- You and Michael,

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,170
trapped... for eternity?

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,080
<i>Okay, Sam. Let's go home.</i>

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,820
<i>Dad?</i>

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,420
<i>I don't think Jack is well, Dean.</i>

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,720
Jack?

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,890
<i>We found a way to bring you home.</i>

19
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,830
We need to use magic
that will draw on your soul.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,530
I am a Winchester!

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,100
<i>You want to know how much of my soul</i>

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,370
I had to burn off
to kill Michael.

23
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,870
<i>Yes.</i>

24
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,240
Nick. He's trying
to resurrect Lucifer.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,300
I'm here.

26
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,340
No!

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,380
I'm trying to understand
Jack without a soul.

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,650
- Listen to me!
- Leave me alone!

29
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,290
I wish I could forget
about him! After what he did?

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,850
This is our only play.

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,570
Jack.

32
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,390
You lied to me.

33
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,790
Jack.

34
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,130
You lied!

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,940
- No!
- No!

36
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,870
I don't understand.

37
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,380
The Ma'lak box can hold
an archangel.

38
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,180
Jack's not an archangel.

39
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,750
Yeah, apparently,
the kid leveled up.

40
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,590
So, what do we do?

41
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,120
We find him.
How?

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,560
I don't know, Cass.
You tell me.

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,490
Okay, the last time
we found Jack, it wa...

44
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,790
It was by praying to him, but
that's not gonna happen again.

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,560
Yeah, you think?

46
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,800
You should never have tried
to lock him away.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,370
You know what?
You're right.

48
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,270
I never wanted to put him
in that damn box.

49
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,670
I wanted him dead.
Dean.

50
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,940
He's dangerous, Cass,
and you knew it!

51
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,940
You've known it for a long time!

52
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,540
But that's okay.
You know why?

53
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,240
Because me and Sam, we've killed
just about everything there is.

54
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,710
And this... Jack...
Oh, we'll find a way.

55
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,920
Because he's just
another monster.

56
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,950
You don't mean that.

57
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,950
The hell I don't.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,770
All right. So, I guess
we got to find Jack.

59
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,670
Yeah. Then what?
I don't know.

60
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,070
Maybe we call Rowena,

61
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,010
see if she can put together
one of those, um,

62
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,380
"soul bombs."

63
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,610
The... thing you were gonna use
against the Darkness?

64
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,550
Yeah, might actually
put a dent in the kid.

65
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,320
Okay.

66
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,450
Sam, I know this isn't easy,
okay?

67
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,090
He... I know how much
he meant to you.

68
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,560
He meant a lot to me.
He was family.

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,030
But this?
This is not Jack anymore.

70
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,900
He's hurting,
he's killing people.

71
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,970
This isn't gonna be easy,

72
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,070
but we're gonna have to do
the hard thing.

73
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,010
We're gonna have to do
the ugly thing.

74
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,950
Ain't like it's the first time,
though, right?

75
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,590
No, honey, it's not like that.

76
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,290
She's just a friend from work.

77
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,060
You should've seen it.
I caught a steelhead this big.

78
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,530
I mean it.

79
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,130
We went up to the cabin...

80
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,600
Oh, my God.
She's such a bitch.

81
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,830
Baby, it's not you.
It's me.

82
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,570
No, I don't think he
took offense. You're awesome.

83
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,840
Just because Mommy and Daddy
aren't gonna be together,

84
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,110
we still love you.

85
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,810
I saw 'em
at Coachella last year!

86
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,050
- Nothing's gonna change.
- Greatest company to work for.

87
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,880
You won't be disappointed. Man
#6: I don't have any problem with those.

88
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,420
- You're my best friend.
- Your, um... profile said 6'1".

89
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,850
I am. Basically.

90
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,350
- You're finally getting a break.
- It's good to see you.

91
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,950
- Come on, baby.
- Why does everyone...

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,190
That's not porn.
I-I don't know what that was.

93
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,790
Stop lying!

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,780
Yeah, I know
it's a long shot, Rowena,

95
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,310
but just try, okay?

96
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,280
I mean, try.

97
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,920
She in?

98
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,520
She thinks
it's dangerous and insane.

99
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,260
But, yeah, she's in.

100
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,490
Well, she knows
what Jack's capable of.

101
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,900
Excuse me.
Coming through.

102
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,480
Nerds.
Takes one to know one.

103
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,910
What?

104
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,850
You. Come on, man.

105
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,320
You're always calling me a geek,

106
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,150
but you know every word
to every Led Zeppelin song...

107
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,290
Backwards and forwards...

108
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,620
You can discuss in detail

109
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,620
every major rock drummer
between '67 and '84,

110
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,330
and... you watch "Jeopardy!"
every night.

111
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,960
Okay.
All right, yeah.

112
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,260
But I'm nothing like these, uh,
you know, gaggle of Zuckerbergs.

113
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,130
Th-They're not...

114
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,970
Mirror Universe builds
facial-recognition software.

115
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,840
They've got contracts
with... with basically

116
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,810
every law-enforcement agency
on the planet. Okay. So?

117
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,980
So w-we need to track Jack,
but he flies,

118
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,840
so if we can't go ahead and
track his license plate,

119
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,250
maybe we can track his...
His face.

120
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,950
His face, exactly.
Okay.

121
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,550
Oh, I got this.

122
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,990
Can I help you?

123
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,660
Hi. I'm Dean Winchester, and
I'm looking for the devil's son.

124
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,060
- What?
- What?

125
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,000
Uh...

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800
I meant I'm Dean Winchester,

127
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,870
and I'm looking
for the devil's son.

128
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,570
This badge is fake.

129
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,980
Excuse me.

130
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,580
Hey. I'm sleeping with
your wife.

131
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,820
- I know. Kind of into it.
- What?

132
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,660
Hey, let me ask you a question.

133
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,390
Tell me who
your favorite singer is.

134
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,990
What?
You...

135
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,890
Look, I know you say it's Elvis,
but we both know that's crap,

136
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,400
so tell me who
your favorite singer is.

137
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,670
Well, it's like you said.
It's Celine Dion.

138
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,830
Uh...

139
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,600
I mean Celine Dion.

140
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,340
It's Celi...

141
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,210
Dean, every time I try
and say "Elvis,"

142
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,110
it comes out...
The sad, horrible truth.

143
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,440
Yeah. You know why?
Because we can't lie.

144
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,080
All right!
Who ate my yogurt?!

145
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,150
Right here!
I knew it was you!

146
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,290
- That was the third... Son of a bitch!
- No!

147
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,790
Guess we're not the only ones.

148
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,120
Double?! You make double?

149
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,160
And that was my parking space!

150
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,830
I hate everyone!

151
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,730
I can't believe you taped it!
I thought it was hot!

152
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,200
Let's go.

153
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,180
<i>In what was supposed to
be a speech on farming subsidies,</i>

154
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,080
<i>the President instead
spent more than two hours</i>

155
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,580
<i>disclosing his entire
tax history,</i>

156
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,950
<i>deep ties to Russia
and North Korea,</i>

157
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,350
<i>and a quote "demon deal"</i>

158
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,620
<i>he made
with someone named Crowley.</i>

159
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,360
Dude. What the hell?
<i>Over to you, Jack.</i>

160
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,490
Did we just walk into a case?

161
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,030
<i>Jack?
I love you.</i>

162
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,730
<i>I've</i> always<i> loved you.</i>

163
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,840
<i>Pundits on both sides
of the aisle...</i>

164
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,410
Okay, Dean.

165
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,280
I think whatever
is happening here,

166
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,020
I-it's not just happening here.

167
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,020
Yeah, no, it's... it's
everywhere, but what...

168
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,090
Jack.

169
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,260
Son of a bitch.

170
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,090
- We have to find him.
- I hate everyone!

171
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,430
Like right now.

172
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,500
- I hate this!
- I am the stapler queen.

173
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I am the stapler queen.

174
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,070
I am the stapler queen!

175
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,410
I need to go to hell.

176
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,380
You mean, like,
metaphorically or...

177
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,050
No. Literally.

178
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,580
And I understand
you can take me.

179
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,920
Really?

180
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,850
'Cause from what I remember,
you've been to hell...

181
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,690
More than once.

182
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,120
Well, this... it's different.

183
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,630
I need time to see the Cage
and study it.

184
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,960
Yeah, that's a no.

185
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,160
So you can go to hell...
Metaphorically.

186
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,100
No, don't.

187
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Wow. Yeah.

188
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,470
You guys are screwed.

189
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,080
Hello.
Oh, hi.

190
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,280
I'm Jack.
I remember.

191
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,990
Well, good.

192
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,690
God.
Eh...

193
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,100
Chuck.
There you go.

194
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,600
Is it really...

195
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,930
How are You here?

196
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,940
You called me?

197
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,440
<i>God...</i>

198
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,870
I don't know where you are.
I don't know if you can hear me.

199
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,280
But please.

200
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,350
Sam, Dean... we need you.

201
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,250
My prayer?
That's why you're here.

202
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,220
Yeah.
Well, that and... him.

203
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,620
Jack.

204
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,530
He's a problem.

205
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,770
I don't mean to bother you,
but we talked before,

206
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,870
and I liked that talk,

207
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,970
and I thought we could just

208
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,310
maybe talk again...

209
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,440
maybe about your daughter.

210
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,550
No.

211
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,650
I don't understand.

212
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,320
You lied to us.

213
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,490
You said you worked with Kelly,
but after you left,

214
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,030
my husband and I,
we made some calls,

215
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,400
and no one knows who you are.

216
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,270
I...

217
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,600
I didn't.

218
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,710
Yes, you did.

219
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,040
Kelly's not away
on some "secret mission."

220
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,580
She...

221
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,350
They think she's dead.

222
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,260
What did you do to my daughter?!

223
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,230
What did you do?!

224
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,500
Stop!

225
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,940
When people can't lie,
the Internet gets real quiet.

226
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,510
Hmm.

227
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,150
Yeah, guess your life
isn't so perfect after all,

228
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,510
EightPackMommy.

229
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,180
- What?
- Yeah, she's got this blog.

230
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,220
Yeah, you know what?
Your kids aren't that cute.

231
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,190
And that gluten-free popover
looks like crap

232
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,660
because there's no gluten in it.

233
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,990
You know what I mean?

234
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,460
I'll stop talking.
Probably a good plan.

235
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,870
You're losing your mind
over one yogurt!

236
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,570
It was<i> three</i> yogurts!

237
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,010
I hate everyone!

238
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,570
I hate everyone!

239
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,880
- I just want to be loved.
- I hate everyone!

240
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,550
I hate everyone!
I just want a sweet life.

241
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,450
I hate everyone!

242
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,850
You see, this is why people need to lie.
I hate everyone!

243
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,150
It's good.
Keeps the peace, you know?

244
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,520
I hate everyone!

245
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,790
Seems like an odd stance for...
you. I hate everyone!

246
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,430
Is it?

247
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,730
I'm a writer.

248
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,260
Lying's kind of what we do.

249
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,970
- I just want to be loved!
- I hate everyone!

250
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,740
Sam!
I hate everyone!

251
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,340
Dean!
I hate every...

252
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,140
Cass?

253
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,240
Cass.
How'd you get here?

254
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,310
He brought me.
Hey, guys.

255
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,520
I know what you're thinking...

256
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,390
It's been awhile,
and I still look pretty good.

257
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,330
No, that's... that's not
what we were thinking.

258
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,860
Where the hell have you been?

259
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,730
Well, you know,
it's a funny story.

260
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,540
It reminds me of a song.

261
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,610
Answer the damn question!

262
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,210
Don't!

263
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,990
It's a little cramped in here,
don't you think?

264
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,120
There. That's better.

265
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,060
So... how's things?

266
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,470
Okay, look. I get it.

267
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,740
All right, I'm from
the deus from the machina,

268
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,000
and you have questions.

269
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,210
So, great. Go.

270
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,280
Yeah, like Dean said,
where have you been?

271
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,780
It's hard to explain.

272
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,720
Um... everywhere and nowhere,

273
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,050
to the edge of the universe
and beyond.

274
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,920
And I saw Springsteen
on Broadway. Man's a genius.

275
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,430
What about Amara?

276
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,860
She's been with me.

277
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,900
Yeah, it's been nice
reconnecting after the whole

278
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,400
"trying to murder me
and end all existence" thing.

279
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,500
- Where is she now?
- Reno.

280
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,800
Turns out she loves kino.

281
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,470
And you're here because...

282
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,840
Because of Jack.

283
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,880
Listen, you guys know me.
I'm hands-off.

284
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,210
I built the sandbox...
You play in it.

285
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,150
You want to fight Leviathans?

286
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,510
Cool. You got that.

287
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,980
You want to go up against...
What was it?

288
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,350
The "British Men of Letters"?

289
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,620
Okay.
Little weak, but okay.

290
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,460
But when things get really bad,

291
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,730
like the Apocalypse
or the Other Apocalypse,

292
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,060
that's when I have to step in.

293
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,960
So You're saying Jack
is Apocalyptic?

294
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,270
The kid said, "Stop lying,"
and I don't know if you noticed,

295
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,770
but the world kinda went insane.

296
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,570
<i>...rioting in the streets</i>

297
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,010
<i>as the Dow drops
nearly 15,000 points.</i>

298
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,860
<i>And it's been confirmed...</i>

299
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,890
<i>The Queen of England is,
in fact, a lizard.</i>

300
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,990
<i>Inside...</i>

301
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,960
See?

302
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,500
Can you fix it?

303
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,670
Fine.

304
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,010
Fixed.

305
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,440
- Really?
- I'm God, Sam.

306
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,380
Yeah, really.

307
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,420
Go ahead. Try it out.

308
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,580
Celine Dion rocks.

309
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,120
Yeah.
Yeah, we can lie again.

310
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,960
And the rioting?

311
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,430
Like it never happened.

312
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,260
Hey!
Who ate my yogurt?!

313
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,210
Dicks.

314
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,150
You're welcome.

315
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,990
Look, the point is

316
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,920
the kid did all that
with two words.

317
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,090
What's next? He sneezes and...
Whoops... there goes India?

318
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,090
I don't know. Maybe.

319
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,960
But this is bad...
Like Me Level Bad.

320
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,130
Can you stop him?

321
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,400
Not exactly.

322
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,900
But you can.

323
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,240
With that.

324
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,000
What is that?

325
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,170
I'm thinking of calling it...

326
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,970
the Equalizer!

327
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,170
Or...

328
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,540
the Hammurabi.

329
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,880
No?

330
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,290
All right, cool.
That's cool. Cool.

331
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,520
Wait, y-you're saying that
this thing could kill Jack?

332
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,330
That?
That'll kill anything.

333
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,830
So you've had this
the whole time and...

334
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,060
And we're just now getting it?

335
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,160
- Why?
- Because I haven't?

336
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,300
- Y...
- I just made that sucker.

337
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,670
Hasn't been fired yet.

338
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,470
So you don't even know
if it works.

339
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,640
If I say it'll work, it'll work.

340
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,210
There's no bullets.

341
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,010
Right, it doesn't exactly
use bullets.

342
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,750
See, existence is
all about balance, right?

343
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,490
Dark and light, good and evil,
chocolate and peanut butter.

344
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,950
Ugh, yeah, okay, Chuck.

345
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,620
- The point, please?
- Right.

346
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,330
So, this doesn't so much
fire bullets as it sends

347
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,960
a wave of multi-dimensional
energy

348
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,860
across a perfectly balanced
quantum link

349
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,400
between whoever's shooting it
and whoever they're shooting at.

350
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,740
What?

351
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,850
Uh, whatever happens to
the person you're aiming at

352
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,850
also happens to you.

353
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,950
So you kill him...

354
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,190
You die.

355
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,890
Right. Yeah.

356
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,760
Look, I know it's not perfect,

357
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,230
and I'd do it myself,
but, you know, if I bite it,

358
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,330
then... existence
also kind of bites it,

359
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,570
so one of you...

360
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,940
Sorry.

361
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,340
I don't understand why we're
talking about killing Jack.

362
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,510
Y-You can fix him.

363
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,480
You can...
You can restore his soul.

364
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,780
That's why I called you.

365
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,280
Yeah, not so much.

366
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,780
You're God.

367
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,590
Well, souls are complicated...
Even for me.

368
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,620
Besides, even if I could,
would you really want...

369
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,990
I mean, after what he did?

370
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,590
Then we bind him.

371
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,230
We throw him
in the Cage until...

372
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,170
Stop, Cass.

373
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,340
You heard him.

374
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,740
This is the only way.

375
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,840
And Billie said
the only way to defeat Michael

376
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,710
was to lock<i> you</i> in a box.

377
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,310
Ugh. Billie.

378
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,780
I liked the old Death better.

379
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,780
He was all about fried pickles
and tickle porn.

380
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,220
This new Death...

381
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,990
She's always sticking her scythe
where it doesn't belong.

382
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,520
There has to be another way.

383
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,160
Well, there's not.

384
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,990
Now, I know you don't like it,
and I don't really care.

385
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,090
'Cause you just heard it
from God Himself

386
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,760
that this is the only thing
that can kill Jack,

387
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,900
so either get on board,
or walk away.

388
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,320
<i>What did you do to my daughter?!</i>

389
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,060
<i>What did you do?!</i>

390
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,830
<i>Stop!</i>

391
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,200
Dean?
Yeah. Over here.

392
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,570
Hey.
Good, I'm glad you're here.

393
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,340
I actually needed to
talk to you about something.

394
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,240
Um...

395
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,280
Have a seat.

396
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,850
Yeah.

397
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,890
Uh... what's going on?

398
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,290
You know what I'm gonna say.

399
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,690
Let me guess.

400
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,500
This is where you tell me
you're gonna pull the trigger?

401
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,060
Yeah, it is.

402
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,370
We don't have a choice, Sam.

403
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,440
Of course we do.
Don't we always?

404
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,270
I mean, isn't that the point
of everything we've ever done,

405
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,510
that we<i> always</i> have a choice?

406
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,910
He killed our mom.

407
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,480
I get it. I was mad, too.
Or you know what?

408
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,420
Hell, I'm still mad.

409
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,490
And a part of me wants Jack
dead... it really does.

410
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,790
But, Dean, we haven't even
tried to save him.

411
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,920
S... Okay.

412
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,830
You heard him, right?

413
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,400
He actually blamed Mom
for what happened.

414
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,830
He doesn't have a soul.

415
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,370
And whose fault is that?

416
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,440
Mine.

417
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,240
I'm the one
who brought him back,

418
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,870
and I brought him back
because he's family.

419
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,470
Okay.

420
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,810
And then he came back,

421
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,210
and he burned his soul off
to save us...

422
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,650
You and me.

423
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,850
And now what? You...

424
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,650
Now you...
You want my permission?

425
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,320
You want me to say I'm cool

426
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,590
with losing him
and losing you all at once?

427
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,400
'Cause I can't do that.

428
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,870
I won't say that, 'cause I...

429
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,440
No.

430
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,340
I've already lost too much.

431
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,050
Jack.

432
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,960
I've been looking for you.

433
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,570
I haven't seen one of these
in forever.

434
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,710
Where'd you get it?

435
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,440
Another world.

436
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,880
Oh. Right.

437
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,560
So...

438
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,160
How many are there...

439
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,060
How many other worlds
or... or universes

440
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,130
or realities or whatever?

441
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,600
I don't know.

442
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,470
Kinda lost count.

443
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,330
Most of them are boring.

444
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,700
One's in reverse.

445
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
In one, there's no yellow.

446
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,370
One... One
of them's just all squirrels.

447
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,610
So, Michael said that
you create these worlds

448
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,820
and you just toss them away

449
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,590
like failed versions
of some book.

450
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,620
And you believe him?

451
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,930
Was he lying?

452
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,730
Is that what you're doing to us?

453
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,600
No. Sam...

454
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,270
you and your brother,

455
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,710
of all the Sams and Deans
in all the multiverse,

456
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,010
you're my favorite.

457
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,180
You're just so interesting.

458
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,980
I mean, like that thing
that happened at the office

459
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,810
earlier today...
That was crazy, right?

460
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,420
And I thought I could
make the world a better place

461
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,690
if people couldn't lie.

462
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,960
Well, it didn't.
It really didn't.

463
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,230
And I went to see
my grandparents.

464
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,360
The Klines.

465
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
Yeah, I thought they liked me.

466
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,100
Maybe they'd still like me.

467
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,400
And?

468
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,570
My grandmother said
I killed her... my mom.

469
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,870
And I did.

470
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,670
Just by being born.

471
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,180
Jack...

472
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,950
I used to hate myself for it.

473
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,320
But I don't
feel that way anymore.

474
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,220
I don't feel anything.

475
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,190
After she said that,
what did you do?

476
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,330
I just...

477
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,730
What did you do?!

478
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,500
Stop!

479
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:18,640
Just stop.

480
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,810
What?

481
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,680
What are you?!

482
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,070
I ran.

483
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,240
Do you watch us?

484
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,440
When you're not here,
are... are you...

485
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,070
watching us?

486
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,380
Yeah.

487
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,580
I mean, you're my favorite show.

488
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,080
Then why don't you do something?

489
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,490
If I had your power...

490
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,050
Sam.

491
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,120
We talked about this.

492
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
Not the way it works.

493
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,530
Wait a second.

494
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:16,100
Why, when the chips are down,
when the world is... is failing,

495
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,570
why does it always
have to be on us?!

496
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,570
Because you're my guys.

497
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,110
But right now,
we need to focus on Jack.

498
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,540
Ah, that kid.

499
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,850
Whew!

500
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,980
Wait a second.

501
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,520
You're scared of him.

502
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,060
Aren't you?

503
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,700
Do you know where he is?

504
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,260
I do.

505
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,600
Then what are you waiting for?

506
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,630
Oh. Nothing.

507
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,300
Dean's already gone.

508
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,640
Mary was a mistake.

509
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,380
But ever since then, I've tried
to do the right thing...

510
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,580
Except for Dumah.

511
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,880
She, um...
She led you astray.

512
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,680
And then I tried on my own,
but every time I try,

513
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,120
it... it never goes right.
It never...

514
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,460
All I ever wanted
was to be good.

515
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:25,030
But now I'm just...

516
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,100
empty.

517
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,370
Even this... I know you're here
because you love me,

518
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,010
and I want to love you back.

519
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,680
It's just...

520
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,180
...I can't.

521
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,780
You can't<i> yet.</i>

522
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,350
We just need time to fix this.

523
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,190
We need to go somewhere safe,

524
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,520
somewhere
where no one can find us.

525
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,740
Cass, step aside.

526
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,210
Dean.
Step aside!

527
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,010
Jack, go.

528
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,210
Run.

529
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,050
I can't.

530
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,050
You have to.
I won't run anymore.

531
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,470
You're not gonna lock me up
again, are you?

532
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,210
No.

533
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,190
Dean?

534
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,990
Dean!

535
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,490
Dean!

536
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,430
I understand.

537
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,240
Dean, don't!

538
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,940
Dean?

539
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,870
Dean!

540
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,240
I know what I've done.

541
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,180
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, Dean!

542
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,110
Hey, hey, hey! Dean!

543
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,610
Stay back, Sam!

544
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,760
And you were right all along.

545
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,490
I am a monster.

546
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,690
Do something.

547
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,400
You're enjoying this.

548
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,200
Shh.

549
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,590
No.
Pick it up!

550
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,160
Pick it up.

551
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,260
The hell, Chuck? This isn't how
the story is supposed to end.

552
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,560
The story?

553
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,970
Lookit, the... the...
The gathering storm,

554
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,870
the gun, the... the father
killing his own son.

555
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,340
This is Abraham and Isaac.
This is epic!

556
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,610
Wait.
What are you saying?

557
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,470
He's saying
he's been playing us.

558
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,810
This whole time.

559
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,450
Come on.
Our entire lives.

560
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,780
Mom, Dad... everything.

561
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,990
This is all you
because you wrote it all, right?

562
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,720
Because... Because what?

563
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,960
Because we're
your favorite show?

564
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,290
Because we're part of
your story?

565
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,560
Okay, Dean, no offense, but your
brother is stupid and crazy.

566
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,500
And that kid is still dangerous.

567
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,770
So pick up the gun.

568
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,840
Pick it up...

569
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,370
pull the trigger...

570
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,310
and I'll bring her back.

571
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,350
Your mom.

572
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,690
No.

573
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,360
No.

574
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,170
My mom was my hero.

575
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,500
And I miss her,

576
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,840
and I will miss her
every second of my life,

577
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,410
but she would not want this.

578
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,910
And it's not like you
even really care.

579
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,180
'Cause Sam's right.

580
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,880
The Apocalypse,
the first go-around,

581
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,180
with Lucifer and Michael...

582
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,450
You knew everything
that was going on,

583
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,890
so why the games, Chuck, huh?

584
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,250
Why don't You just snap
your fingers and end it?!

585
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,560
Look, I...

586
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,420
And every other bad thing
we've been killing,

587
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:14,730
- been dying over...
- where were you?

588
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,130
Just sitting back
and watching us suffer

589
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,200
so we can do this over and over
and over again...

590
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,540
Fighting, losing people we love?

591
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,740
When does it end?
Tell me.

592
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,010
- Dean, don't do this.
- No, we're done talking.

593
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,750
'Cause this...

594
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,450
This isn't just a story.

595
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,120
It's our lives!

596
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,890
So God or no God,
you go to hell.

597
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,600
Have it your way.

598
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,310
Jack.

599
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,680
Jack!

600
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,750
Jack!

601
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,850
Stop it.

602
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,250
Stop it!

603
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,130
Jack.

604
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,660
Hey, Chuck!

605
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,590
Hey, Chuck!

606
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,920
Aah!

607
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,330
Fine!

608
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,030
That's the way you want it?

609
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,110
Story's over.

610
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,270
Welcome to The End.

611
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,860
Hey, you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

612
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,300
Wait. I thought Chuck said
that the gun

613
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,110
was the only thing that could...

614
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,080
He's a writer.

615
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,480
Writers lie.

616
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,940
What's happening?

617
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,640
Yeah, about that...

618
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,510
We should talk.

619
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,280
What the hell is happening?!

620
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,010
<i>Souls.</i>

621
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:10,050
They're souls from... from Hell.

622
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,530
Hi.

623
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,530
<i>You, uh, need a ride?</i>

624
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,990
<i>I know, right?</i>

625
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,490
Do you think it's...
Do you think it's expensive?

626
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,220
Honestly, it might be.
I think so.

627
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,490
<i>Okay, let's look.</i>

628
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,200
<i>Oh, my gosh. Look at this one.</i>

629
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,830
<i>Stop.</i>
